I'm an 80's kid.

And what I remember most from that decade is Grandma. Scolding me. A lot.

Usually, it was because I hadn't washed my hands well enough. But it could also be due to the hole in the ozone. As a kid, Grandma and I spent a lot of time together. Both my parents worked, and Grandma and Grandpa had a small business that didn’t have a *no kids allowed* sign out in front.

I’m pretty far from childhood now and I had never seen Grandma since then, that is until her wake a couple of weeks ago. But I’m getting ahead of myself.

Yeah, The ‘80s. Grandma. She was like crazy obsessed with handwashing.

I tried to make mine spotless, but no dice.Grandma would always make that face like someone was force-feeding her a lemon while dragging their fingernails across a chalkboard. Then Grandma would take me hard by the hand, marching me right back to that turquoise bathroom sink in the little apartment they rented that smelled like mothballs and liver. God I came to despise that sink. Especially, the plastic cup that sat in the center of the toothbrush holder. The cup in which sat Grandpa's teeth. I would stare at the teeth while Grandma reminded me what a bad little hand-washer I was turning out to be.

Then Grandma would scrub my hands, furiously, scolding me, muttering about, well, who knows what?

Then, when I was in the first grade Grandma and Grandpa had some kind of trouble and abruptly closed their jewelry shop in Queens. That was right about the time when my parents started arguing constantly. That was just before Dad moved out to Newark. After Dad left, Mom told me she was having an affair one night over TV dinners and bad sitcoms. She said it was with some judge and we might be moving to a big house. She said the judge was hot. I didn’t say anything.

I stopped going to Dad's little apartment after a while because he just cried nonstop about Mom, her affairs and that he had roaches and sleep apnea. When I told Mom that Dad was falling apart she just said, "I have a right to be happy, too! Don't I?" Then she told me to go wash my hands.

I remember thinking if we could just maybe get a golden retriever, like my friend Amy’s parents did when they separated, then maybe Mom might stop being so grouchy all the time. And then, who knows? Maybe Dad would even come back and we could all be a family again. It didn't quite pan out that way though. But that’s what little me thought.

What happened instead was Grandpa had a fatal coronary but a few weeks later while toasting Grandma at their anniversary party over ante pasta. Grandpa was saying, and I quote, that, “he loved Grandma more than the devil loves buying souls and that no matter what Grandma might have done-“ and then his toast was cut short by his heart going Hiroshima and his face falling in their Anniversary cake.

After that Grandma decided she needed to trip around the world, I guess she kept tripping because we never saw her again. That is until a couple of weeks ago. But that doesn’t count if you’re dead. Before Grandma decided to depart she paid me one final visit.

*Grandma’s Last Goodbye*

"Put down Barbie. Now!" Grandma said.

I put Barbie down and went to go give Grandma a hug. Grandma stopped me. She grabbed me by my shoulders then pushed me so that I took a step back.

"You too nice!" she scolded. "No hugs. We talking now."

"You want to play Barbie with me, Grandma?"

Grandma made the sour face. Then she pinched my cheek; hard. I remember it hurt enough to make me cry.

"No crying! No playing, Barbie now! Grandma is going away on a trip. Listen. Let me tell you something, Elsa."

"Okay," I said.

"Men? No good! Women? No good! People? No good!

You like Grandma. Like your mother."

As usual I didn't understand what my grandmother was on about but I knew better than to interrupt her once she got on her horse.

"You are too young to understand me very well. But you need to work very hard at school and be best. Be number one. Number two for toilet!

You find a rich man. Maybe ugly too. You stop being nice, okay? People, not your friends. Nice girl very bad thing. You be nice if you need but remember, you leave your house, there are ten thousand enemies waiting. You find man, rich, powerful. Then you will see. Then, you will; know."

I nodded at Grandma. I just wanted to play Barbie and have my family back.

"Where'd Grandpa go to?" I had asked her.

"Hell," was all Grandma said. And that was that till the wake four decades later.

Ironically, after Grandma disappeared into the wind Mom and Dad did manage to get briefly back together.

I remember those months, being so happy; until I wasn't.

When my sister was born, Dad finally figured out that Esther wasn't his because she had red hair. There was only one ginger player in the picture and that would be the honorable, Judge \[redaction\] who sported the same shade of Bozo. Crestfallen and cuckolded yet again, Dad suffered a nervous breakdown and Mom divorced him stat.

When Dad finally got out of the hospital, he ended up marrying one of the nurses who had cared for him. I never saw Dad again.

By the sixth grade, my mother's relationship with the judge had been discovered by his wife. Threatening to change his title to the Dishonorable Judge \[redacted\], my mother was dropped and we never got that big house and Esther grew up without a father. My mother and I did not get along well after all that drama and still don't. I tried to have some kind of relationship with Esther but we never really bonded and I feel like my Mom poisoned her against me.

You see by the time I was thirteen, Mom and me were at each other’s throats. I just left one day and after some drama ended up living with my paternal aunt. After that, I didn't really see too much of my mother or sister. If it wasn't for meeting Blaine in high school, I don't know what I would have done for human connection. It was almost too good to be true.

Blaine was a kind hearted man. Do almost anything in the world for me. And, Blaine had had the kind of family I always wanted. Big and loving. They always made me feel like I belonged and when Blaine proposed to me during Thanksgiving weekend of our senior year of college I was over the moon.

"Yes," was my answer. Of course!

And, at long last, my life had a happy ending.

And now? Two beautiful boys. A great civil service job with flexible hours. An inground pool in the suburbs.

And then Grandma died.

She was 100 on the button right to her death day. What a shock. I had barely thought of my Grandma and really never expected her to leave me anything in her will. But she did. And it was something I was not even aware had been in my family for generations.

"Of course, she'd leave *you* the jade necklace," my mother remarked icily yet sourly at the wake. Sort of like a diabetic lemon Italian ice.

"I'm sorry for your loss," was all I said before taking an empty seat with Blaine and the boys far away from my mother and sister.

Yeah, it’s weird. I don’t even think much about my family but that day? That day when I saw Grandma laying there rigid and sour all these feelings and memories that maybe had been repressed came rushing up to greet me. To be honest; it’s a little overwhelming. What we bury and forget about.

...

*Two Weeks Later*

I stood before the bedroom mirror. Behind me, Blaine's reflection placed the jade necklace I had been bequeathed gently around my neck.

I felt so much love for him. He was my savior.

"This is an amazing necklace. Clasp is kind of weird, though. Shit. The stones look like they’re shimmering. I think they’re vibrating," Blaine remarked. "It will look so beautiful on you, baby."

"I love y-," I heard myself begin to say when I felt Blaine finally get the clasp locked.

I felt a tinge of vertigo. Then I heard myself say, "Get the fuck away from me!"

"What?" a surprised Blaine responded.

I turned around. My husband stood before me. He was smiling with a puzzled look on his face. And so much love.

I shoved him. He staggered back a step. His hip went into the corner of the dresser.

“FUCK! WHAT THE FUCK!?!”

Then he screamed.

“Fucking Legos! Dannnnyyyy!”

I might have laughed but it was getting tight around my throat. I tried to clear it. No dice.

I felt the necklace grow tighter. And then?

Shit. Just. Got. UNREAL.

A voice in my head said what sounded to be, ***"constrictionnnnn and frictionnnn. Separationnnn and mayhemmmmmm….. Damnation to all mennnn…"***

And for a second the necklace loosed its grip. I coughed and sputtered.

"Blaine. Run!" I heard my throat croak with extreme effort.

"What?" he asked staring blankly.

And then I closed my eyes. I saw my next husband. He was a senator maybe. There was a flag on the walnut wall of his office. He had silver sideburns. He was someone with money. Someone with power. He was old too, maybe late ‘70s. And then I saw it. What looked like a mushroom cloud behind him.

"Elsa! You don't look so-" Blaine began snapping me back to reality.

Again, the air grew scarce. The necklace constricted. I reached behind me on the bureau and felt a letter opener somehow jump into my hand. My fingers clutched it. I could use it to get this thing off my neck.

Then Blaine put his arms around me and embraced me.

“Easy baby. It’s gonna be okay.”

I felt my arm raise itself, the letter opener firmly grasped by my dominant hand.

"Baby! What is it?" Blaine asked. "You're white as a sheet. You’re scaring me."

Then the necklace seemed to loosen its grip again. My hand relaxed around the letter opener and I let it fall to the rug.

And then, then in my mind, I saw myself downstairs in the kitchen in the morning sunshine. At first I thought I was brewing coffee. But upon closer inspection of hallucination theater’s marquee, it seemed I was deeply engrossed in brewing up a batch of Marlboro cigarettes into some sticky gunky brew. I then poured it carefully through a funnel into a thermos that said, “World’s Best Husband!”

I shook my head. Then the me brewing cigarettes hastily threw them in the sink and down the disposal. I saw my head shake like a gnat landed in my ear. Whose thoughts were these trespassing against my head?

Oh, I know. Maybe it was the last few late-night mint chip ice cream and *Snapped* bingeathons.

Yeah, I think its called waking dreams or lucid dreaming. Yeah, combined with the stress of remembering my fucked-up childhood. No, Blaine and my boys are my family now. Everything is fine.

All that stupid stuff Grandma was talking about? That's all behind me now. And Blaine's all the man I'll ever need. I don’t care if he’s poor.

I began to hug Blaine back and then I felt it again. Only harder. More insistent. Like icy fingers digging into my neck, forcing goose bump flesh into a what might prove to be a fatal short-squeeze.

Blaine said, "Heyyy. Heyyyy. Shhhhh. It's gonna be okay. But look, I promised Karen I would cover her shift tonight. You gonna be okay alone, babe?"

"Sure," I said, feeling the jade loosen its grip. "But," I heard myself begin, in a voice that sounded nothing like mine yet eerily familiar.

"Working too hard can give you a heart attack. You ought to know by now."

Now I recognized the voice. It was Grandma's. And it wasn't very nice. It whispered in my ear: *You can take the necklace off Grandma but you can't take Grandma off the necklace...*
