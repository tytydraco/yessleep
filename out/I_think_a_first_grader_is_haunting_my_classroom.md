I'm a first grade teacher at a school where a lot of our students come and go from week to week. The city I'm from sees a lot of immigrants so we have many students touch base at our school and move away when they end up in a more permanent home. Last week Monday, I was told a new student would be joining my class. I didn't think anything of it because, like I said, I get new students all the time. I asked if we know anything about them, and my principal told me there was no file for her at all, but her name was Yulia. 

Yulia joined our class just like every other student. I paired her up with a more talkative classmate with the hopes that she would acclimate well to the classroom. She was a pretty quiet kid, but I didn't think much of that. By the Tuesday, I noticed she was whispering to James, one of my students, on the playground. After a few minutes, James approached me and asked to go to the nurse, claiming his head was suddenly hurting. He ended up going home early. 

Wednesday, right before dismissal, Yulia was standing in front of my desk, looking at me with a blank stare. I asked her if she was alright, and she just started whispering gibberish. When I asked her to speak up, she began to whisper louder, still speaking nonsense, except this time I heard her say the name of one of my students, Piper. 

By Friday, Yulia was absent and I was told she moved away. 

Well, fast forward to this week, we are watching a video on the carpet, and I hear a shriek from the bathroom within my classroom. I pause the video and practically sprint to the bathroom. By the time I get to the other side of the classroom, Piper had opened the door and was hysterical. When I finally got her to speak, she said Yulia's name and pointed to the bathroom mirror. 

I peeked in and obviously there was nothing in there, but I sent Piper to the nurse just to be safe. It was a bit of a chaotic rest of the day, so I didn't get the chance to do any more investigating.

Well, this morning, I get to my classroom early, so I decide to scope out the bathroom, thinking maybe there was a bug or something that had scared Piper. But, as I go to open the door, it's locked from the inside. Obviously, I'm a little freaked out by this, but I just let it go and call the janitor to open the door with the master key when he gets the chance. 

in classic janitor fashion, he didn't end up coming today, but out of curiosity, I jigged the handle right before I left, and it opened perfectly fine. When I stepped inside, though, it was burning hot in there, and as I walked around I saw chunks of black hair on the floor like someone had gone crazy with the safety scissors in here. I was almost pissed that one of my kids had given themselves a haircut, but then I remembered that Yulia had black hair, and I just got the hell out of there. 

I'm scared to go back tomorrow. Updates to come.
