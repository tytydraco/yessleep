[PART1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/qcBFasTnnG)


I was sitting there again. The dry grass of the empty field rustled softly in the late morning breeze.

I had quit the convenience store job. I simply didn’t show up one morning. As if the universe had been waiting for it, my phone chimed. It was the familiar question:


“Available shift tomorrow. Interested?”


At that moment, I felt like the place was calling me back. It had been waiting for me.
So the next morning, I found myself once again in the train station parking lot. The fat man just laughed at my return, but since he was busy stuffing a cheeseburger into his mouth, he wasn’t very talkative. I went through the usual motions and headed through the small town toward the field.
It looked exactly the same. This place hadn’t changed at all in a few months. My stomach twisted in both anxiety and comfort. I was glad to be back… but who knew what was waiting for me this time?

With a bit of coffee from my thermos, half-hanging out of the car door, I started reading through the day’s instructions. This day looked like it would be just as strange. I didn’t even bother reading the early morning time slots—they never concerned me. Those were the wrap-up tasks from the previous shift. My shift always starts around 11.



12:42 – To maintain a clean work environment, please collect any trash from the field. Trash bags can be found on the back seat of the service vehicle.
I glanced at my watch: 12:31. But the field was spotless—not a single piece of trash in sight, nothing that looked like it needed picking up.

Oh well, I thought. Something always turns up, like it always does.

15:11 – If the gardening lady is present, please ask for her name. If it’s not Amanda, politely ask her to leave. If it is Amanda, greet her and let her go about her business.

I sighed deeply. Here comes the hard part of the shift again.

Ten minutes passed while I finished my coffee and leaned against the car, enjoying a little siesta. I watched the clouds drift lazily across the sky and listened to the birdsong. But without realizing it, my watch ticked over to 12:42.

And in the blink of an eye, trash started pouring from the sky.

I jumped back into the car in a panic as a rotten watermelon exploded on the ground right next to me. Most of it fell toward the middle of the field, but I heard the occasional thud of something hitting the roof of my car. One greasy, melted cheese wrapper even slapped onto my windshield.


It lasted barely a minute, but a nice little landfill had formed out there.
When I finally crawled out of the car, the stench hit me—absolutely revolting. But the thought that I was the one who had to clean all this up? That was somehow worse.

It took me about an hour and a half to go over the entire field with a black trash bag, collecting every disgusting bit I could find. I won’t go into details—it was just typical household waste, but I have no idea where it could’ve come from.

After I was done, I rested in the car for a bit. I left the two big trash bags a little farther away so I wouldn’t have to smell them right next to me.

To wind down, I ate a sandwich and picked up the guide again to keep reading.



18:45 – If Amanda is still present, please inform her that it’s time to head home. If she’s no longer there, you have no further duties — continue monitoring the area.
20:47 – Please check the sunset. If it sets in the direction of the road, there’s nothing to worry about, continue your duties. If it sets toward the forest, leave immediately. If it sets from any other direction, please notify the contact number.
23:09 – If anyone is on the premises, please instruct them to leave.
01:37 – Please climb the ladder and stay there for one hour. For your own safety, do not come down, no matter what.
07:44 – Please count how many times the bird on the field chirps, and send the result to the contact number.

It didn’t seem like a difficult day… but I really hoped I wouldn’t run into those rabbit-masked figures again tonight.

I was resting in the car, feet dangling out the window, playing games on my phone. That’s when I realized it was 15:14 — I should’ve already taken care of the task. I jumped out of the car like a kid who just got caught doing something wrong.
The field was still calm and oddly peaceful — as much as a place like this could ever be.

But the moment I looked around, I felt my heart skip a beat.

A young, attractive woman stood at the back of my car, staring at me with a teasing smile on her face.
Once I snapped out of it, I gave her a little wave and spoke up:


"Excuse me, ma’am," I said, adjusting the flashlight on my belt. "May I ask your name?"


The woman casually leaned against the side of my car and looked me over from head to toe.


"No," she said coldly — then suddenly burst into laughter.


I eyed her warily. She was barefoot, wearing a light, summer dress with a floral print. Her wild, fiery red hair whipped in all directions in the wind.


"I’m Amanda," she laughed again, and then, as if to toy with me, she turned and darted off toward the center of the field.


I didn’t know what to make of this. It didn’t feel like one of those strange assignments, or like the nighttime visitors that gave me chills. Amanda seemed both completely human and… something else.
If I met a woman like her in a normal setting, I might ask her out on a date.
But this wasn’t a normal place. And nothing here was something I wanted to get involved with.



Amanda ran to the center of the field. It was only then that I noticed a small flower garden there. I was certain it hadn’t been there before — a neat flowerbed full of colorful blossoms.

As if it were the most natural thing in the world, Amanda was already planting flowers next to it. She had proper gardening tools too, which — again — made no sense to me.

I just stood there, watching her work. There was something calming about the whole thing.


“Why are you staring like that?” Amanda asked a few minutes later, glancing up at me.


“I… I’m not… I wasn’t staring,” I stammered awkwardly.


She smiled sweetly. I pretended I hadn’t been looking at her and focused instead on the peaceful field. The sun was warm — not a scorching summer heat, just pleasantly warm.


“Amanda?” I said suddenly, surprising even myself. “Where did you come from?”


Amanda gave me an annoyed look.


“From space,” she replied, frowning and staring at me.


I didn’t know what to say. I just looked into her light blue eyes and delicate, narrow face. Then, suddenly, her scowl vanished and turned into a playful smile — no, more like a giggle.


“You’re weird, new guy,” she laughed heartily. “Where else would I come from? Just like everyone else. I had a mom and a dad.”


She kept laughing. I stood there silently, deep in thought, watching her. I couldn’t tell if Amanda didn’t know where she really was, or if none of this seemed strange to her at all.


“And what’s your name, new guy?” Amanda asked after her laughter subsided.


“Steve,” I replied quickly.


“Nice to meet you, Steve,” Amanda said softly. “You seem like a good guy.”


Her words were genuinely comforting. Still, I felt it would be best to keep some distance from her. The poor girl might not even know what she’s a part of — or where she really is.


Time flew by. Amanda occasionally asked me things — who I was, where I grew up, what my childhood was like. I also learned a few things about her. She was born in England; her father worked on a ship, and her mother was a housewife. When she was eleven, they moved to the States. They came to try their luck — but life hadn’t been easy. After that, Amanda didn’t want to talk anymore, and I didn’t ask. It seemed better that way. I liked Amanda, and I could tell it was hard for her to talk about those things.

Helping her with the gardening made time pass even faster. Before I knew it, it was already 6:39 p.m. Amanda had to leave by forty-five.

I stood up from beside the little garden. The sun was already much lower than when we started.


“Amanda,” I said gently, “it’s almost time for you to go.”


“Oh, right,” Amanda said with a hint of surprise.


She stood up from the flowers too, brushed off her dress and her dirty hands, then stepped over and gave me a hug. Her body was warm and soft.


“Take care, Steve,” she said kindly.


Then she started walking toward the forest.


“Amanda!” I called after her.


She turned and waited for what I had to say.


“Amanda, do you know what this place is? Or what’s going on here?”


Amanda only smiled softly.


“Yes,” she said after a pause, “but I won’t be the one to tell you those things. If you start seeing more than just the money in this place, you’ll figure it out yourself.”

I didn’t say anything. Amanda walked into the forest — but before disappearing, she turned back one last time and waved kindly.
I waved back. It felt familiar — like someone had waved to me like that before.


I stood outside my car, watching the sky. I was certain now that the sun was setting on the side of the road, so I could continue my shift. Still, it felt nice to just stand there in the warmth of the day's last rays.

Amanda came to mind. The girl who didn’t belong here, yet somehow did. What stuck with me most was her last sentence — that I’d figure out the secret of this place on my own. A part of me was afraid of that. Of what the company would do if I really found out what was happening here.

But the money… the money was really good.

Then there were the people who appeared here. Some of them just vanished, like the old man or the woman in red. But Amanda and the rabbit-masked ones… they walked into the forest. Was there something in the forest?


I stood there until it was completely dark around me.
Panic started creeping in, so I figured it was best to get back in the car. There wasn’t any task tonight involving the rabbit-masked people. But I swear — I was scared of them. I had dinner in the car and watched a show — trying to distract myself from this place.
Time passed slowly in the car until it was 11:09 p.m. I had to return to my duties. I was nervous, deeply anxious. I hoped that no one would be out there — that I’d finally have a night without having to walk out to someone in the middle of the field and ask them to leave.

But no. I wasn’t that lucky. As soon as I stepped out of the car to take a look around, I saw that tonight wouldn’t be easy either.
Someone was sitting in a large armchair in the middle of the field, watching TV. I couldn’t see clearly who it was, but the television was definitely on. Right there in the middle of nowhere, someone was watching a cooking show.

Rubbing my tired eyes, I walked toward them. I thought I was prepared for anything — or so I believed.

But as I got closer to the chair, an awful sense of déjà vu came over me. Like I had seen this before — lived it already.

Even the back of the armchair looked horribly familiar. And when I finally saw who was sitting in it, I went pale.


“Mom?” I asked, my voice cracking.


I remembered this place now. It was years ago. I was a senior in high school. One day I came home, and Mom was in a really bad mood. She sat in the armchair, smoking, watching a cooking show. I didn’t bother her — I just sat on the floor beside her, and we watched TV together until evening.


“Mom, what are you doing here?” My voice was still shaking.


“What? Where? Steven, why are you looking at me like that?” she asked, startled, as if she had only just noticed I was standing there.


My eyes welled up with tears. My mother had been dead for over six months. I dropped to my knees in front of the armchair and hugged her. We must have looked absurd — me hugging my mother who was watching TV in the middle of a field.


“What’s wrong, Steven?” she asked gently. “Why are you crying?”


I didn’t answer. The whole situation was impossible.
Minutes passed, I think, there in the moonlight. But a notification on my phone pulled me back to reality. I stood up from beside my mother, who just smiled at me softly. I pulled out my phone. The message was from the usual number:


“Steven, no one is allowed to remain on the field. Please instruct them to leave immediately!”


I rubbed my tired face. My dead mother was sitting in front of me, watching television in the middle of nowhere. The company I work for expected me to send away the woman who raised me.


“Mom, how did you get here?” I asked again.


She just shrugged vaguely, then started looking for the remote. 
She looked young. Younger than when I’d last seen her, before she died. Her behavior matched the other night visitors I’d seen here — confused, vacant-eyed. As if she’d just… ended up here somehow.
This wasn’t my real mother. She’s buried in the ground, far away from this place.
I felt a spark of anger. This place was toying with me now. Like it wanted to break me. So I started in on the usual script.


“Mom… or, ma’am, I have to ask you to leave. This is private property.”


My mother looked at me, wide-eyed. I tried to hold myself together. This isn’t my mom. I had to stay strong.


“Ma’am, please leave the area.”


“All right, Steven,” she said quietly. “If that’s what you want, I’ll go.”


My lip trembled, my eyes welled again, but I couldn’t let go.


“Steven?” she asked again. “Could you help me up from the chair?”


I took her hand to help her. She stood before me, looked me in the eyes, and the last thing she said was:


“I love you, son.”


I closed my eyes.
Her hand vanished from mine.
A few moments later, I opened my eyes again. She was gone. The chair was gone. The TV too. Only the headlights of my car lit up the edge of the field.


I walked back to my car. I got in and just stared blankly ahead. This wasn’t like the other times. I wasn’t scared, or nervous, or angry that I didn’t understand what was happening. This time, it felt like something had broken inside me. Or maybe something had simply been lost.

I don’t know how long I sat there like that. My head felt completely empty — I couldn’t think of anything. I just sat and stared. Everything that had happened today had shaken me. I felt like maybe I shouldn’t have come back at all. Would I have been better off at that crappy store job?


I looked toward the field again. In the center stood a simple plastic ladder.
Is it that time already? I glanced at my watch. I quickly jumped out of the car and walked over to the ladder.

It really was just a ladder. We had one just like it in the store’s stockroom — and now here it was, standing in the middle of the field.
Since the instructions had said to climb it, I did. I climbed all the way to the top. Once there, I set an alarm on my phone to make sure I waited the full hour.

Time passed slowly. At first, I just stood on top of it. Then, though it was uncomfortable, I sat down on the top step and waited. I sat there, in the dark field, at the top of a ladder. The car’s headlights glowed in the distance behind me, and above, the stars.


That’s when I saw someone approaching.
The figure was limping — struggling to move through the grassy field.
I stood on the ladder and pointed my flashlight toward them — and immediately regretted it.

A man was walking toward me. He was covered in blood — or at least I think it was blood. His intestines were hanging out, dragging on the ground behind him. Half his face was missing, and he was completely naked.

I nearly lost it on top of that ladder. I wanted to run back to the car. But the instruction had been clear: Do not leave the ladder, no matter what happens.
So I stayed. I sat up there like a lunatic.

The man walked right up to the base of the ladder. Then he stopped — as if someone had told him, this is far enough. He just stood there, reeking. He stank of rot.
My legs were shaking. Sweat poured off me. That thing just stood there, staring. 
Minutes passed. Eventually, I gave up being tense. I sat back down on the step, but I was very careful not to let my legs hang down.


“You waiting for someone?” I asked, surprising even myself.


He didn’t reply. He just stood there.
And then, just like that, he left. He gathered up his guts and started dragging himself back toward the woods. Once he was far enough away, my phone alarm went off. My hour was up.

Not much longer now, and I’d finally be able to go home.


The last hours are always the hardest.

07:44 had already passed. I stepped outside to count how many times the bird in the field chirped. I had to listen carefully — it was barely audible. If I counted right, it made one repeating chirp every minute. I sent the result to the designated number. The reply simply praised my work and told me to continue.

After that, I got back in the car. I was already getting sleepy. I ate all the sandwiches I had, and only one energy drink remained — I was saving it for the drive home.

I thought about the events of the night. What was my mom doing here? I had assumed that all the figures who appeared here were somehow tied to the company, or at least people I was meant to watch over — not just the field itself. But my mom was dead.
Could it be that all the other figures who showed up… were also dead? Amanda too?
And then who — or what — are those rabbit-masked creatures?


Eventually, 11:00 rolled around. I received the usual text: my shift was over. I could go home.

The drive back was always exhausting, but this one was pure hell. I could barely keep my eyes open, and even the energy drink didn’t help. But somehow, I made it back to the train station. The fat man was already waiting, looking sleepy. He mumbled something about partying with his friends because it was Friday. I didn’t really listen — I was too tired, and this shift had left me completely drained.

I somehow stumbled home in a daze. Once I got inside, I pulled out the envelope — I didn’t want to count several thousand dollars in the middle of the street.

But what I found surprised me. There was only two thousand dollars inside, and a note.


“Steve, you forgot this morning’s package. This has been deducted from your pay. Please be more attentive to your duties next time.”
— The Company



“…Fuck you,” I muttered angrily.


I rested over the next few days. Tried to recover from it all. Or at least, I tried.
I searched the coordinates online, hoping to find something — but there was nothing. Nothing useful.
Then I got another message. Again, from the company — but this one was different. It was new:


“Steve, due to your reliable service, we are offering you a special high-difficulty shift.
IMPORTANT: This shift requires heightened focus. Please only accept if you are confident you can handle it. Special pay rate applies.”


I hesitated for a moment...But this is why I left the store job, isn’t it? Something was calling me back. Or someone.

I accepted.Four days later.
