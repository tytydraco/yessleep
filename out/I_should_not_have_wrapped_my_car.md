Two months ago I finally bought the car of my dreams: a 1983 Buick Grand National GNX. The paint is in near-mint condition but I wanted matte black, so I knew I needed to wrap it in matte black vinyl to complete the aesthetic I'm going for. 

I got some quotes from a few local wrap shops, but most were too expensive, and I already spent most of my spare cash on the down payment. One new place, Max Wraps, did offer a really good deal, but they had no online reviews yet, so I called them up last week.

"Max Wraps," a male voice had answered the phone. 

"Yes hi, I have a Buick Grand National and want to get a matte black wrap. You quoted me $500 online, is that correct?"

"Ah, Joseph!" the voice said. "Yes, we are running a special to build up our review history. I'm Jake. When can you bring her in?"

"Heck, I can bring it over right now!" I'd replied. 

"Awesome," Jake had said. "We'll see you soon then!"

I hung up the phone, feeling like I'd struck gold—matte black gold. I hopped in Jessica (that's the car's name!) and she rumbled to life. I sped over to Max Wraps, which was way on the other side of town in a mostlty vacant industrial park. The sun was setting and it began to rain as I pulled into the eerily empty parking lot. 

After driving around the rows of vacant units for awhile, I felt lost. This industrial park was comprised of five main areas labelled A through E, and Max Wraps was supposed to be C 300, but the sign on C 300 said Creighton Nanotech. 

So I called Max Wraps again. Jake picked up and said, "I see you outside. Sorry, we haven't even got a sign yet. The previous tenants' sign is still up. Let me open up the garage bay for you!"

"Alright, sweet," I said. 
Then a large, semi-truck-sized garage door began to squeak and grind open. I drove inside and turned off the car.

Inside the garage was just a few industrial work lights and some rolls of vinyl wrap material up against the wall. 

A tall, young, clean cut man in a black shirt and khakis stepped forward to shake my hand as I stepped out of the car. 

"Hey Joseph, I'm Jake," he said.

"Yo, what's up man?" I said.

"We just need your credit card and I can get to work. It takes a few days, and we'll call you when it's done."

I tapped my Wells Fargo credit card on his handheld terminal to transfer the $500, then ordered an Uber home.

"How long you been wrappin' cars?" I asked.

"I used to work at a wrap place in NYC for a few years, but just moved out here to Portland a few weeks ago to start my own thing," he said with a bit of New York accent.

"Nice, nice," I said. "Well, I'm glad to be one of your first customers. I'm gonna go outside and wait for the uber," knowing I had quite a distance to walk to the entrance of the industrial plaza.

"Thanks Joseph," Jake said as I walked out.

Just before the garage door closed behind me, I could have sworn that I heard another, much older voice say something like, "Follow him home," right behind me, as if someone had been standing right there and said it directly into my ear. 

However, when I whirled around, nobody was there. 

A few days later, I got a voicemail from Jake saying the wrap was finished, so I took another uber over there around 10 AM on a rainy Saturday. This time I no problem finding Max Wraps' location, though I noticed the Creighton Nanotechnology sign was still up. 

The garage door was already open when I arrived, and there was Jake, standing next to my freshly wrapped, matte black Buick Grand National. 

"Holy shit, that looks freakin' amazing," I said. 

"Yeah, it looks real clean," said Jake. "Well, here's the keys," he said, tossing me the keys. "Enjoy!" Then a phone rang in a back room, and he said, "Oh, I gotta get this, feel free to leave," and rushed through a doorway in the back of the garage, which closed behind him.

It struck me as very abrupt and rude, but as he was a New Yorker who seemed to be operating the business entirely on his own, I did not want to judge. I did look briefly around the garage, but aside from the work lights, there was nothing else whatsoever in the space. Not a single tool box, desk, work bench, cutting table, air or water hose could be seen.

"Weird garage," I said to myself as I hopped into the car.

Just as I started up the engine, again I heard the same, old, male voice as before.

"Follow him home," it said, right in my ear. 

"What the fuck!" I yelled. I turned around and looked all around inside and outside the car, but there was no one there. "What the actual fuck!" The stereo was turned off, too, and my phone's volume had been all the way down.

I got out and looked everywhere: around the car, under the car, in the garage, and outside the garage. No one was there, and the parking lot was completely empty. There was not a loudspeaker or even a vent that could have emitted sound from what I could see.

I had been having some trouble sleeping the past few nights before that, and had recently gone on a new antidepressant, so at the time, I figured it was just the meds fucking with me. 

I got back in the car, which was still running, and drove out. Just as I was turning out of the parking area specific to that row of units in area C, I paused and looked back to unit 300. The garage door was still open, and Jake was standing exactly in the middle of it, staring out into space with a completely blank expression.

I honked and waved to him, but he did not react in any way; he did not turn to face me and return the wave. He did not even blink. 

I figured he must be staring at something across the way from him, so I looked, but nothing was there. Then I looked back, and he was gone, with the garage door beginning to close.

"What a weirdo," I said to myself as I flipped on the stereo to 1080 The Fan sports talk, and drove off.

I noticed on the way home that it seemed unusually quiet in the car. My GNX has a custom exhaust for extra cool sound, and in general, it's just an 80s car without great sound insulation. You normally hear road noise, rattles, squeaks, engine and exhaust sounds, and typical wind noise (especially on the highway). 

However after the wrap, as soon as my windows were rolled up, my car seemed now to be as quiet as a Maybach or Rolls Royce inside. I'd never had a car wrapped before, so I wasn't sure if this was a normal outcome, but it seemed impossible that a thin vinyl car wrap could have any accoustic benefit. 

"What the hell did they do to you, Jessica?" I asked aloud, switching off the radio. 

Just then, I passed by a house with a fenced in rottweiler, who appeared to be barking at the car as I drove past, but all I could see was his mouth opening and closing—there was no sound whatsoever. 

"Jesus," I said aloud. "This is really weird." 

I stopped there and rolled down my window slightly. Now, the sound of the dog barking was complely audible. So I called Max Wraps.

The phone rang and rang, but Jake didn't pick up. So I turned around and drove back there. I got out of my car and tried to go in their front door, but it was locked. I banged on the door awhile, but no one came to the door. Then I banged on the garage door. No response.

"Well." I muttered to myself. "I have a quiet car now. Why complain, Joe? Just consider it a good thing." 

Just as I turned back to my car, I noticed something extremely odd. Despite driving in the rain, my car was bone dry. Not a drop of water could be seen. As the rain would hit any part of the car, it would simply bead up and roll off. 

"Hydrophobic coating, nice!" I said. Normally to get a hydrophobic wax or ceramic coating applied is another thousand bucks at least, so I felt like they'd really gone above and beyond. They'd even treated the windows. 

Before getting back in, I pulled out my pocket knife to test the coating. I poked the wrap on the lower corner of the door, where no one would notice a slight scratch, and tried to scratch it. 

At first, nothing happened, but then I noticed I'd left what looked like a gray scratch. But when I rubbed my finger over the gray scratch, it wiped completely away. Then I looked at the tip of my knife, and it was missing about 1mm of material from the tip, exposing a sliver of shiny steel (the blade is black anodized). 

"Whoah, what the actual fuck is this shit?" I said to myself, rubbing again the area where the knife scratch had been. As I rubbed my finger nail across the surface, I applied a bit of pressure, and sure enough it ground away part of the finger nail, leaving a streak. After wiping that streak off, I got back in the car.

"$500 for super coating, Jessica," I said. "This is wild."

After I closed the door, silence descended around me, and I heard it again—the voice. "Follow him home," it said directly in my left ear, which was close to the window glass. 

"Yo!" I yelled out, getting back out of the car and walking backwards away from it. At the top of my lungs I yelled, "WHO THE FUCK IS DOING THAT?! WHO??" turning as I yelled at the empty buildings and trees. I drew my Sig Sauer M18 9mm pistol and fired three shots into the air. "DO NOT FUCKING FOLLOW ME HOME," I yelled. "I WILL FUCKING END YOU!"

Breathless and wet now, the car door still open with the car running, the sound of "YOU" seemed to echo through the vast complex. The acrid smell of gunpowder hung on the air. 

At that point, I half expected a candid camera crew trying to make a viral video to emerge from some bushes, or something, and apologize for the misunderstanding while offering me cash. However, no one stepped forth. All I could hear was rain.

I bent down and picked up my brass shell casings, as I did not want to leave behind any evidence of the 37 city ordinances and state laws I had just violated. After putting the shell casings in my pocket, with my gun still in my right hand and my eyes looking about the area, I walked back over to the vehicle and looked inside. 

There was no water on the seat or the interior of the door. None on the steering wheel. None on the floor. Rain was certainly falling in, as the wind had picked up slightly, but I could watch the droplets hit the upholstery and then just disappear. 

I slowly bent down and took a knee on the wet pavement so I could get a closer look. Setting the gun down on the seat, I took a water bottle out of the back seat, opened it, and poured a little out onto the seat. The water literally just disappeared as if it was being completely absorbed by the seat, yet the seat did not appear to get wet, and touching it, it felt completely dry. 

"OK, what in the ever living FUCK, Jessica!" I said. 

At this point I genuinely began to feel afraid, like someone was watching me. The hairs on the back of my neck and on my arms stood straight up, and goosebumps formed. I felt suddenly like someone was standing directly behind me, so I grabbed the M18, jumped to my feet, and turned around with the firearm at my hip pointed outwards. Again, no one was there. 

"Hell nope," I said, literally jumping into the drivers' seat and slamming the door shut. I slowly backed out and turned around, then drove slowly out of the parking lot, looking around as I did so for any sign of who might have been responsible for the voice, still assuming it must have been a prank using some kind of directed sound beam device, like the ones we'd used at checkpoints in Iraq. That was the only logical explanation I could think of.

However, I saw no trace of humanity. I drove around the entire complex three times and did not see a single car or person, and none of the units had a sign. You could see in through their windows nothing but empty rooms with gray carpets and the lights off. However, there were also no "for lease" signs.

"What even is this place, Jessica?" I said to the car to break the impenatrable silence. Then I rolled down the window and drove home through the rain, checking my rear view mirror the entire way back. However, I did not see any occupied cars behind me until after I merged onto highway 26. Not a single one.

After I got home, I went inside and laid down. I felt unusually tired and was developing a migraine. The vision in both my eyes began to shimmer and flicker. I grabbed a cold pack from the freezer, then laid down on the couch, placing it over my eyes. 

I drifted off into a dream in which I was back at the garage. I was inside it, and the door was closed. Jake was standing there, his face up against the metal garage door, so close it looked like his nose must be pressed flat against it. The halogen work lights were the only source of light, casting sharp shadows across the floor as I slowly walked up to Jake.

"Yo, Jake, you OK brotha?" I said as I got near him. No response. As I neared him, I put my hand on his left shoulder and said, "Bro, Jake, you OK, man?" 

He felt wet to the touch but appeared dry. I retracted my hand and looked at it. From the area where I had touched him, the skin was completely gone, revealing bleeding red flesh. The wetness I'd felt had been my own blood. I looked back at his shoulder and there was my skin, attached to his black shirt. But there was no pain. 

"Jake, something is wrong with me. Your shirt, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get anything on your shoulder." No response. "You're freaking me out, Jake," I said. "I need a first aid kit bro. Is there one around here?" No response.

I pulled my shirt sleeve over my left hand to protect the skin, and grabbed his left shoulder, then pulled back to turn him around to face me. As I did so, his face peeled off the garage door. It had been partially merged into the door, as if the door had closed with him standing there, such that it had scraped away his entire face. What stared at me now was like if you took a razor sharp katana sword and cleanly lopped off the front of someone's face just past the eyeballs, like what you see in a video game if you lean too close into someone else's character's face: just flesh and weird muscles, pop eyes, fucked up teeth, and what's left of a toung, blood pumping out of it all. 

I jumped back in abject terror, and his stiff, dead body fell like a 2x4 from vertical to horizontal, pancaking onto the garage floor with a nasty, wet slap. I stumbled backwards and into one of the work lamps, which fell backwards. I reached instinctively to catch it with my right hand, but only managed to grab the hot metal grating in front of the lamp, burning my skinless fingers and casting the shadow of fingers large across the ceiling. 

Then I bolted awake, sitting upright on the couch so quickly that the cold pack flew across the room. How long had I been asleep? It was dark outside. I took a deep breath and my own body odor. I hadn't taken a shower since the previous night, so I figured I'd take one and head to bed.

I undressed and tossed my clothes in the hamper, then headed into the bathroom. I turned on the hot water and put my hand under the water to feel if it was hot or cold, but to my surprise, I felt nothing but the vague sensation of water going across my hand. I pulled it back, and looked at it, half expecting not to see skin, but instead, I just saw my normal hand, perfectly dry. 

"Ugh, some of that hydrophobic coating must have gotten on me," I said to myself. "Fucking Jake. I should have known better! No reviews. What were you even thinking, Joe?!" I berated myself. "Well, it will probably wash off eventually," I said, turned the shower handle to a medium warm setting, stepped into the shower.

As the water began to hit my body, although I could feel its impact, I could not feel its temperature. Further, it just beaded up and ran down my skin without me getting even slightly wet. I tried applying soap, and although the slimy soap film did stay briefly, it would slide down and then off as the water hit it. 

As I stepped out of the shower, I realized I didn't even need a towel, because I wasn't wet. Not even my hair felt wet. I must have washed away something though, since I no longer smelled bad. In fact now, I had no smell at all, not even the smell of the scented soap. 

When I went to brush my teeth, I couldn't taste the toothpaste. I stuck out my tongue, and it was completely dry. There was still saliva in my mouth, but it was all in a weird pool under my tongue. And yet my mouth did not feel stick and dry like you would expect.

At this point, I had no idea what was happening to me. My hands were shaking, and I couldn't stop sweating, although the sweat beaded up and rolled off just like the water. I looked at myself in the mirror, trying to reassure myself that I was still me, but something was fundamentally wrong. I decided to go to the hospital, but as I turned to leave, I felt a strange urge to look at the car one more time.

Jessica was sitting in the garage, perfectly matte black and ominous. The more I stared at her, the more I felt a pull, an almost magnetic force drawing me closer. Despite my fear, I opened the door and got inside. As soon as I sat down, the engine roared to life without me even turning the key.

"Follow him home," the voice whispered again, this time sounding like it came from inside the car itself.

"No," I muttered. "No more."

I tried to get out, but the door wouldn’t budge. Panic surged through me as the car began to move on its own, reversing out of the garage and then accelerating down the street. I fought to control the steering wheel, but it felt as if it was welded in place.

The car sped through the streets of Portland, the city lights blurring past. I felt like a prisoner, helpless in the grip of some malevolent force. The voice continued to whisper, growing louder and more insistent. "Follow him home. Follow him home."

Suddenly, the car turned sharply and headed out of the city towards the old industrial park where Max Wraps was located. I screamed for help, but the windows were still soundproof. The car stopped abruptly in front of the garage, the door opening by itself as if welcoming me.

I got out, my legs trembling, and the rain poured down, but I remained dry. The garage door creaked open, revealing a dim light inside. I stepped forward, drawn by some unseen force, and as I entered, the door slowly grinded shut behind me, but I was unable to back out.

In the middle of the garage was a figure I recognized instantly: Jake. But he wasn’t the Jake I remembered. His eyes were hollow, his face a mask: the one from my dreams, but decayed and emaciated. His voice was a grotesque parody of the friendly tone he had used when we first met.

"I shouldn't have wrapped your car," he croaked, his voice echoing unnaturally. "I unleashed it."

"What do you mean?" I yelled. "What is this? What happened to me?"

He laughed, a dry, rattling sound. "The wrap, it's not just vinyl. It's a nanobot lattice. We didn't just change the look of your car. We were testing an artificially intelligent, self-healing nanoskin."

I felt a chill run down my spine. "Nanoskin? How can a skin be intelligent?"

He shook his head slowly. "It is an entity, a cancer that can only exist within the bounds of its new skin. But Creighton made a mistake," he croaked with a raspy, leathery husk of a voice. "The self-healing process requires proteins and enzymes. It feeds on the living tissues of those with whom it comes into contact."

I finally managed to back away, but the walls felt like they were closing in on me. "How do I starve it to death? How do I get rid of it?"

Jake's hollow eyes seemed to pierce through me. "You can't. Once the process begins, it must run its course. You are its vessel now, its means to spread. It needs to keep you alive to operate its wheel and pedals, but you can no longer digest food."

A cold wave of realization rushed through me, as the only sensation I could even feel now was an internal punch to the gut. I was no longer a man; I was something else’s plaything. My mind raced, trying to find a way out, a way to escape this nightmare.

"It must feed you, so that you can create new enzymes for it," Jake said, his voice faltering and becoming increasingly hard to comprehend. "Otherwise, it will consume you entirely, and find a new driver."

With those words, Jake collapsed to the floor and broke apart into a thousand fragments of dusty, withered flesh and bone. The only sound was now my own ragged breathing and the nearby hum of the car's engine, still running, still waiting.

I stumbled back to the car, driven by a mix of desperation and a twisted sense of obligation. As I sat behind the wheel, the engine purred, and the voice, now unmistakably my own, whispered, "Follow him home." That was when I realized: it had been my voice all along.

I understood now. The car was no longer just a car. It was a harbinger of death, a vessel of fear. And I was its driver, doomed to an eternity of silence, unable to hear the screams of the victims we would plow through for sustainance. 

As I drove into the night, the streets of Portland turned into an endless labyrinth of shadows, silently dancing cars, and my own whispers. There was no escape, only the road ahead, leading to places unknown, to people who would never know what hit them until it was too late.

"Follow him home," I whispered as I saw a man getting into his car, my voice blending with the entity's, as we became one. With my last shred of consciousness and free choice, I pulled out my phone and am writing this to you, so that perhaps I might save a stranger. If you see a matte black Buick Grand National, get inside your house or car as quickly as possible, and stay there, in case it might be Jessica.
