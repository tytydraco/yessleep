My resort only had four floors, but the elevator ride down from floor three with Kilday felt like the longest of my life. He gave off the same carefree chill-guy vibes he always had, but I was suspicious of him now. I saw a flicker of something in him I’d become a pro at spotting in Amisha—the subtle, telltale gleam in the eye of a person who smiles to your face before they stab you in the back. Or maybe I was just being paranoid.

“I reserved a fire pit on the beach tonight,” he said. “How about 8:00. You’ll be off then. It’ll be you, me, and my partner.”

“I’ll let you know,” I responded, acting like nothing had changed. “I don’t know if you heard the scene that married couple caused. I have to file an incident report and do a bunch of other stuff.”

He let me out of the elevator first. “No pressure,” he said, stepping out after me. “But you know you want to, though.”

“Of course. I’ll let you know.”

“My girl!” He held up his arms and pointed at me with both hands as he strolled to the Aqua Table for dinner.

Now, with the spa treatment behind me and the Wojciechowskis gone, I finally had time to look for the tall, black shipping case. It had been in Kilday’s suite before he arrived but was mysteriously moved before he checked in. Morris had been able to use our security cameras to track it up another elevator to the fourth floor in a different wing of the resort. If I hadn’t been already, I was now certain it had something to do with Kilday and his partner. And someone was trying to keep it a secret.

This wing was scheduled to begin renovation in a couple of days and was thus unoccupied and stripped of all its furnishings. The fourth-floor hallway had no carpet or wallpaper when I stepped off the elevator. There were over forty rooms on this floor, but I already knew where to start looking. At the far end of the hall was room 4380, another presidential suite much like the one Kilday was staying in. Hospitality has taught me that people’s tastes and habits are predictable more times than not. They like what they like. I slowed down as I got closer to the end. Worrying thoughts raced through my head. Where I had started out curious, I now felt only tension and fear. I suddenly wondered if we were in Sagittarius, the astrological sign Neal said was associated with the demon. I looked it up on my phone, and sure enough, we were. It was the middle of December, still squarely in Sagittarius. I didn’t even believe in astrology, but dread was already washing over me. I thought about calling security to let Morris know where I was. It might be embarrassing, but I didn’t care. However, when I opened my recent calls, I noticed something. The call I had made to Leilani, the spa attendant, that morning was missing from the list. In its place, at around the same time, was a call to an unknown number. Perplexed, I called it. It rang six times, then just when I expected it to disconnect or go to voicemail, the call was picked up. I waited.

“Hello?” I finally said after several long seconds.

I was met with the sound of static. Then it grew. It was all around me. The static in the air I had felt a couple of times over the past two days returned. Now I felt chills. If that hadn’t been Leilani at the spa today, then who was it? Now my arm hairs stood up and folded over. I ended the call and it all stopped. The air was still again. By now I had reached the double doors to suite 4380. I looked outside from a window at the end of the hall. Darkness had crept in without my awareness. I had always hated walking around hotels alone at night. But I couldn’t turn back now. No, I told myself, I was stalling, and I was not going to let Neal the front desk agent and Brandon Kilday scare me. I used my master key to open the door and walked inside.

I flipped the light switch. The black shipping case stood upright in front of me, in almost the exact spot I found it in 4180 two days ago. But now it was open—and inside it was empty. The suite was utterly still, there wasn’t a sound. The furniture was removed and even the carpet, leaving the odd contrast of ornate wallpaper against the layer of dense, black rubber beneath the carpet. I slowly made my way through the central living room toward the master bedroom. Then I opened the door.

There were wax candles everywhere—many dozens of them spread across the floor. And situated in the center of the room, with the shutters closed and the lights turned off, was Amisha. She sat in a reclined, purpose-built, metal chair with a hospital IV drip running through a needle straight into a vein in her right arm. Her eyes were closed, and she wore noise-canceling headphones and nothing else. I was so confounded by the sight of her, I don’t think I moved for a whole minute. I started looking around the room once I gathered my senses, being careful to avoid knocking over the candles. There was a symbol made in red paint on the rubber flooring. It was our parent company’s corporate logo. The whole thing was way too similar to the scene in the Wojciechowskis’ room for comfort, and for my second ritualistic setting in the last hour, I think I handled it pretty well. I tiptoed over to Amisha. I didn’t dare wake her, and she looked to be in a meditative state. I examined the label on the bag of hazy liquid connected to the IV drip. Below a table of ingredients with medical terms I didn’t know were two lines of text that read: (company name) inculcation proprietary blend. For maximization of shareholder value and optimization of efficiency.

It was actual corporate Kool-Aid. I was beyond horrified. And there was a container with more bags of it against the wall. Kat and Rory were right. Amisha had generated fake wedding photos and used the cover story of traveling to New York so she could spend several days injecting the inculcation fluid directly into her blood. I stepped back and noticed the candles were arranged in concentric rings around Amisha and the logo. Then I noticed the dolls. There were dozens of voodoo dolls nailed up and down the wall facing Amisha. They were faceless except for a pair of X’s for eyes drawn on each one in permanent marker. There were names written across their bodies. I found Kat, Rory, Neal, Morris, and countless more employees in departments under Amisha’s purview. Each one had a nail driven through its chest to hold it in place, and at the end of each nail was a black ribbon with a different business buzzword printed on it: hustle—grind—empower—execute—collaborate—stakeholder—rockstar—diversify—equity—engagement—personalization—lifestyle brand—net promoter score. They were everywhere. I searched for one with my name. Dread mounted as I looked up, down, and along the wall. Finally, I found a voodoo doll on the bottom row near the floor. It was close to one of the candles, which had singed part of the doll’s burlap material and turned it black. Tiny beads spilled out from a growing hole. It had a nail and ribbon driven through it like all the others. Mine read: human capital.

I didn’t know what to do. I exited the bedroom, quietly shut the door, and sat on the floor in the living room for a good twenty minutes. I was so shocked and bewildered by what I’d seen, things like Kilday’s mysterious partner and all the strange occurrences I’d witnessed around the resort now seemed outlandish and trivial. I had my career and livelihood to think about now. Was I going to continue working for this company? If I did and moved up, was this the fate that awaited me? Should I start sending out job applications? Was this limited to my employer or even just the hospitality industry? Were all corporations doing this? Was anywhere safe?

Finally, I stood up and left the suite. Amisha surely had to get up to eat and use the bathroom at some point, and I didn’t want to be around when she did. I went down the elevator and walked back to the lobby and my office in a daze. Check-ins were few and Neal wasn’t a talker, so I was able to spend the next couple of hours alone at my desk with minimal guest interaction. I must have been on autopilot for the handful of calls that reached me. I don’t even remember answering them. I sat there trying to figure out who to tell, running alternatives over and over through my head. Should I contact the GM? The ownership? The police? None seemed like good options. Anyone I went to would either not believe me, probably be doing it themselves, or tell me it wasn’t a crime and there was nothing for them to do. I decided the best thing I could do was nothing at all. By then, 8:00 was approaching. I told Neal I was going home and walked off-property, leaving my car in the parking garage. I needed a drink. I didn’t want to be alone and I had just the place to go.

My resort had a footbridge to the beach that crossed over a major road traveling along the coast. At the end of the bridge was a fake lighthouse and a curving staircase to the sand. I looked out at the beach in the cold, night air. Winter temperatures by the water could reach the low 40s after sundown, so there was usually no one on the beach. There was a row of concrete firepits along the sand that families flocked to in the summer and sometimes reserved days or weeks in advance, though on nights like this, they were usually vacant. But tonight, there was one firepit halfway between the bridge and the nearest lifeguard tower that was already in full blaze. I heard the familiar tones of numetal pumping from a mobile speaker and saw Kilday’s silhouette tossing pieces of wood into the fire. Was it strange, even troubling, and telling about where I was in my life that I sought comfort and company from the man who seemed to be connected to all the eerie phenomena over the past few days? I thought about it, but I didn’t care. I zipped up my light jacket and descended the stairs to the beach. I took my shoes off and carried them in my hand as I walked across the sand to the firepit.

Kilday lowered the music volume when he saw me approaching. “There she is! I knew you couldn’t resist a good time. Here, have one!” He reached into a big YETI cooler, opened a bottle of Modelo, and handed it to me. “No one to stop us drinking glass bottles out here! Well, the sign says no alcohol on the beach, but like, whatever, right?”

I turned the bottle upside down and chugged it like it was sophomore year. “Got anything stronger?” I wiped my mouth and asked.

“There’s the Osprey I know,” he said, digging back into the YETI. He pulled out a full 2-liter handle of Irish whiskey. He took a long swig, then passed it to me. I couldn’t pound it like him, but I swallowed enough to make my younger self proud.

“Where’s your partner?” I asked, handing the whiskey back to him.

“Coming,” he said, trying to hold back the sheer breadth of his grin.

“How long have you been together?”

“Ten years as of yesterday.”

“Aww, sorry they couldn’t make it on the actual day.”

“Nah, don’t worry. We’re not, how should I put this…exclusive? My partner has a lot going on. Has to be in lots of places at once, you know?” he said, taking another swig. “More whiskey?”

I quietly burped and felt my throat burn. “Ughhh-haha,” I laughed. “Maybe I’ll just stick to beer.”

“Modelo Especial comin’ right up!” He snapped off the bottle cap with his belt buckle and tossed the open bottle to me.

Beer splashed my hands and face when I caught it. “You dick,” I said, laughing again and flicking drops at him.

We drank, talked, and even roasted s’mores. I avoided bringing up Amisha. I didn’t want to think about it and partying with Kilday was the kind of release I needed. Kilday soaked one of his s’mores in whiskey before holding it to the fire, and it engulfed in flames like a torch, startling us both. He surprised me by taking a bite right out of it anyway, apparently none the worse for it. Eventually, he quit on the whiskey too and stepped down to beer with me. It turned out he brought a bag of limes he’d forgotten about, and we started cutting them into wedges on the lid of the YETI with a knife that had a Modelo logo on the handle. I wondered if that was the kind of company he consulted for. He sure loved to drink. Maybe his expertise was with beverage companies. There ended up being far more lime wedges than we had beer bottles to squeeze them in, so after another hour-plus of drinking and chatting, we started tossing the limes into the fire. If we stayed really quiet, we could even hear the juice popping inside some of them.

“Did you bring a trash bag?” I asked, ever the hospitality professional, as I neared my limit and took stock of all the glass bottles in the sand around us.

Kilday looked concerned for a second. “Oops…” he said before bursting out laughing and clanking his last bottle with mine. Beer came out through my nose, which only made me laugh harder. I took another tiny sip and I was done, too hammered to keep going. Kilday picked up one of the empty bottles and tossed it straight into the fire. I heard the glass shatter over the concrete pit, then tossed my bottle in as well. Kilday smirked, reached for another bottle, and straight-up baseball pitched it into the fire. We turned to each other and busted up laughing again. We both stood up and walked around the fire, picking up empty Modelo bottles and just chucking them into the pit. I can’t imagine what people would have thought if it had been spring or summer and there was anyone around us.

“Oh!” I exclaimed, spotting a partially deflated volleyball by the sidewalk a short distance away. I almost tripped over myself running through the sand to grab it. “Hey! Mr. Kilday!” I shouted, before giving it my best underhand serve and sending the volleyball soaring toward him.

“Oh, shit!” he said and turtled up when the ball sailed over his outstretched hands and went right into the fire. Glowing embers shot out and the fire immediately smelled of burning rubber.

I rushed over to him. “I am so sorry!” I said, trying to pull him to his feet.

“Wait, wait, wait!” he shouted, running toward the water. I watched as he grabbed a great, long piece of beach wood and dragged it back to our pit. He stumbled, then hoisted it up, and heaved it on top of the fire. The beach wood was dry and brittle, crumbling right away and creating a big plume of smoke.

We both collapsed into the sand and wiped away our tears from continuing to laugh so hard. By then I was really feeling the effects of all the alcohol. “You brought water, right?” I asked him.

“Yeah, hang on.” He slowly got up and went back over to the YETI. He brought two ice-cold water bottles over to me and pulled me up. We stood there for a moment, enjoying some much-needed hydration while feeling the cool, night air and listening to the roll and crash of the waves.

“When your partner gets here, we’re not going to say we hooked up, right?” I asked.

He shrugged it off. “It wouldn’t matter. My partner has many partners.”

It was an odd response. I stood there quietly, trying to think through what it meant. Neither of us said anything for the next few minutes. It got a little awkward. We finished our water bottles and started on two more.

Then I heard something above us, a sound I could not identify, what I can only describe as a disruption in the air. When I looked up, I could no longer see the stars. There was a ball of fire dropping out of the full-black sky, not directly above us, but maybe two hundred yards to the south. It looked like the burning wreckage of a small, falling aircraft.

“What is that?” I asked.

Kilday looked on in reverence. “My partner. Barbatos.”

The alcohol may have had something to do with it, or maybe not, but I could feel my stomach rising up past my chest into my throat. My insides turned hot and my skin ice cold. The ball of fire was still falling. I looked around us. There was another bonfire going now, north of us, past the next lifeguard tower.

“Can they see this?” I asked, indicating the people at the other firepit.

“What do you think?” asked Kilday.

I feared they couldn’t. I gauged my distance from the other bonfire. I’d never be able to reach it.

The fireball slowed as it neared the ground. A breeze picked up, and as if on cue, a large, black feather landed on my shoulder. The tip of it was singed, glowing like an ember from the fire. Then more feathers fell, drifting on the wind until a dozen of them littered the area around us. I watched as a great pair of wings unfolded and spread from within the fireball. The thing within it hit the ground and kicked up a cloud of sand, putting out the raging flames. The beach to the south went dark momentarily. This may sound hard to believe, but I didn’t know if I was really in danger or not. It wasn’t obvious that I should flee. While I had no doubt what I was witnessing was real, Kilday had not done anything to put me in danger. The only tangible threat of danger seemed to be what happened to the Wojciechowskis.

“The dead seagull in 3135—did you put it there?” I asked.

“Yes,” Kilday answered.

“Was that for your partner, too?”

“No, Osprey,” he said with kind eyes. “That was for you.”

“I don’t understand.”

“You’re right about people. They are terrible. Adults are all still children. The pentagram, the bird, the blood, that was just for show. I had to get rid of those people because they made you miserable.”

Barbatos was closer now, close enough that I could see it clearly in the ambient light from the moon and streetlights. All the features of the eerie, tall figure I’d seen around the resort came together. It had raw muscle tissue with no skin, and now I noticed burn marks covering its body. Its arms and legs were long, its hands and feet massive. It was at least seven feet tall, and where its neck met the base of its head, the raw tissue stopped. The head was a large, yellowish skull, that looked almost human aside from the two long horns sprouting from the sides that nearly came together at the top, forming a circle wider than the skull itself. Disturbingly human-like eyes floated in cavernous sockets, attached to nothing. Its unmoving lower jaw hung wide open. Giant wings full of thick, black feathers remained folded on its back. I ceased being able to control my breathing as it got closer. My lungs felt too large for my chest. Then, in the blink of an eye, Barbatos vanished.

“Is it…gone?” I asked Kilday.

“It’s never really gone,” he answered.

Sure enough, I could see giant divots in the sand where its feet landed. It was still coming closer.

I faced Kilday. “So, what then? Are you possessed by it or something?”

He seemed to find the idea hilarious. “What? No way! I said we’re partners, remember?”

“Then what do you want with me?”

He put his hands on my shoulders. “It’s not up to me.”

He turned me around. I looked at the sand at my feet. I could tell Barbatos was right in front of me, though I still couldn’t see it. But I could feel it. The demon’s sulfurous, hot breath washed over my face. I gasped and seized up when I felt its wide palm and long fingers touch my side.

Kilday spoke into my ear from behind. “I had nothing and was going nowhere when Barbatos chose me ten years ago. I met a woman who introduced me to Barbatos, just like I’m doing for you now. She was rich, sexy, funny, everything I wanted and wanted to be.”

I felt Barbatos reaching down my legs with one hand and up my torso with the other. My muscles spasmed and cramped. I desperately wanted to move but my body couldn’t.

Kilday circled around me and continued. “All Barbatos needed from me was my soul as tribute. I’ve been without it for a decade. And I don’t feel any different!”

My hair floated above as I felt Barbatos cup my face and stretch my scalp.

I followed Kilday with my eyes as he went on. “Think about it. We can have whatever jobs we want, live wherever we want, make as much money as we want, eat what we want, drink what we want, smoke what we want…fuck who we want! It’s gonna be rad!”

Barbatos held me still. I managed to move my lips. “But what happens to us after? When we die?”

Kilday smirked and shook his head. “Who cares? We’ll live longer than we ever would have! We’ll make it to a hundred if we want! But it’s all up to if Barbatos wants you.”

I felt the demon’s hands gradually slither away from my body. I could move and breathe normally again. Kilday took a few steps back and tilted his head upward. I couldn’t hear him, but I could see his mouth moving. It was clear he and the still-invisible Barbatos were talking. It went on for a good minute. Kilday glanced over at me once, then two more times. His body language changed, like he was arguing with a parent. I had the distinct sense it wasn’t going well.

Then Kilday wiped his face and came to me. “So…it’s—it’s not gonna work out.”

I didn’t understand. “Wait, what?”

“Don’t be upset. Barbatos doesn’t pick everybody.”

I wasn’t upset at all, but I was so confused I kind of just stood there. “Well, good.”

Kilday looked down, let out a sigh, then slowly lifted his eyes. “Not quite.”

“What do you mean, not quite?”

“Barbatos doesn’t think we can corrupt you. It’s hard to explain, but the gist of it is, you’ve lost all regard and faith in humanity already. You’ve corrupted yourself. All on your own. And like, maybe if you didn’t realize that about yourself and didn’t know you were a bad person, then maybe we could’ve had something to work with, but—”

“—I’m not a bad person!”

He put his hands on his hips. “That’s you reacting emotionally. Can you look me in the eye and say it again and mean it?”

I had to think. I thought about Dustin, I thought about the Wojciechowskis, I thought about all the hotel employees I’d hated over the years because I thought they were idiots who never learned and made the same lazy, stupid mistakes over and over because they never listened to me. I thought about how my default approach to every guest was to smile at them but secretly hate them until they convinced me otherwise. The Wojciechowskis were indeed assholes, but had my mentality (which led Kilday to them) led to the dissolution of their marriage and possible jail time? I don’t know if I was thinking straight, but then suddenly, I even hated myself.

“See? You know, don’t you?” said Kilday. “I argued for you, but I’m not the one who decides.”

“Then what happens now?” I asked.

“Well, here comes the part even I’m not gonna like. We have to sacrifice you.”

My lungs swelled up with air. I noticed something gleaming in Kilday’s hand. The Modelo knife. I turned and ran barefoot through the sand. The people at other bonfire were too far away. I knew my best chance was to run to the bridge over the street and somehow make it back to the resort. I was much lighter and faster than Kilday and I quickly took a lead on him. I didn’t know where Barbatos was.

Running across the expanse of sand was difficult in my drunken state. Just getting to the bridge took a ton out of me. I made it to the curved steps, but I could feel my temperature rising and my stomach about to leave my body. Keeping upright and scaling the steps was impossible. I bent over and crawled up. That gave Kilday time to catch up. When I was near the top of the steps, he grabbed my ankle. I kicked at him, and in retaliation, he stabbed me in the calf with the Modelo knife. I screamed and pulled away from him. I prayed someone at the resort had heard me. I traversed the last step and tried to amble across the bridge, doubling over and holding my gut, with the knife still in my calf. I fell over and pulled the knife out, then stood up and tried again to run. I made it barely three strides. I sunk to my knees and vomited the alcohol all over the footpath in a putrid, yellowish mess. I tried to get up, but merely threw up again, allowing Kilday to catch up. He practically bowled right into me, knocking us both down. I stood up and he stood up, and then he threw up too, straight liquor and lager, into the same puddle as mine. His big, overweight body sweated profusely and struggled to ventilate itself. I crawled past him, but then Barbatos descended from above and blocked my path. I could see the demon again now. It was hideous, terrifying, and appalling, yet I couldn’t look away.

“Is there any other way?” I asked it directly, crying now.

I saw Barbatos’s floating eyes aim at Kilday. But he was a mess, propped up against the railing, wheezing for air, vomit leaking through his goatee. Then Barbatos looked down at me and spoke. “One may offer a substitute for tribute.” Its voice was alien, utterly unnatural, and almost too deep to understand.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“Can a corruptible substitute be provided?”

I tried to think. Then it hit me. “Do you mean a bad person who doesn’t know it?”

“Clarify.”

“What if I take you to someone worse than me who thinks everything they do is good and for the right reasons?”

“Proceed.”

We left Kilday on the bridge and I limped through the resort, probably trailing blood from my calf. I couldn’t see Barbatos alongside me, but I knew it was there. I went past the first wing to the second and took the elevator up to the fourth floor. Barbatos appeared behind me once I reached the double doors to presidential suite 4380. With Barbatos there, the doors opened by themselves. The demon’s horns scraped the suite’s vaulted ceilings. The bedroom door opened and we saw Amisha, still in the chair and hooked to the IV drip. Barbatos was beside her in a blink. It removed her headphones and clutched her jaw when she looked up and gasped in shock and alarm. I watched Barbatos run its other hand along her shivering body, intuiting what it needed to about her through contact just as it had with me.

Barbatos faced me. “The substitute tribute is acceptable.”

With a flick of its wrist from ten feet away, Barbatos sent me sailing out of the bedroom. The door slammed, confining Amisha alone with it inside. I drank water from the sink and let myself slide down the wall to the floor. I sat and I cried, for how long, I don’t know. But I eventually stood up, walked myself to the parking garage, got in my car, and drove home. I sent a letter of resignation to my GM the very next day. I still haven’t returned to the hospitality industry. I probably never will. I now live in another state in a cheap studio apartment, sitting inside alone and riding out the last of my savings account. I don’t have a job and don’t know where to start looking. I don’t know how to go about answering questions about my strengths and weaknesses or how I might be a team player and a leader to my colleagues. I know too much about myself now, things I wish I had never learned. My hope is that by writing this, I may bring myself a certain, small amount of closure so that I can hopefully, [someday soon, start anew.](https://connorgunnin.com/)
