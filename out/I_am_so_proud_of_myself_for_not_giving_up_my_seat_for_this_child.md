I pride myself in not giving up my seat in any public transport and especially aeroplanes. If someone has failed to get proper allocated seats then it is their own fault and I do not care about parents with children, when I buy a seat it is for my own comfort. I have had so many arguments with passengers wanting my seat but I always stick to my guns and tell them no. For some reason its always the seat that I have paid for that other people want and I don’t know why its like that, but it simply is.

I use to be weak and just allow other people to take my seat but then something clicked in me and I said no more. The seat I buy is for myself and if other people lack organisational skills to procure seats, then it is their fault. I kind of like arguing and I didn’t think that I would be the type to enjoy arguing. The thought of arguing with strangers use to terrify but now it gives me excitement. I am going on holiday and I have booked my flight and I am sitting next to a window.

I get to my seat and not even a minute goes by but a woman comes to me and asks me whether I could swap seats with her child. I straight up and say no but the woman seemed scared and she was begging me to swap seats with her child. I wasn’t going to give up my seat for anything or anyone. She went back to her seat and the plane takes off and then the child comes up to me, and straight away I get freaked out because the child takes off his sunglasses, his eyes are all black.

The black eyed child asks me to swap seats with him but I stay firm and strong, and I tell him no. Then the child smirks and says that I am going to regret my decision. I go to sleep for a little bit and then I wake up to some of passengers on the plane withering in pain. The little child was causing them so much pain by just looking at them and he said to me “if you don’t switch seats ill start torturing the passengers and even kill them” but I kept strong and I said no.

Then as more time went by a scared plane steward begged me to swap seats with the child, he was causing so much suffering. I kept to my seat and when the black eyed child started to pop passengers heads by just looking at them, the child came to me and said “if you don’t swap seats I’m going to blow off more heads by just looking at them” but I kept strong and said no.

Then finally we got to out destination and half the passengers were killed by having their heads popped off. Then when I got on another plane to get back home, that same child was there again with his scared mother. He wanted another scared passenger’s seat, but they refused and now he was going to do the same thing again, where he tortures other passengers to make the other person give up their seat.

The black eyed child has chosen to torture me first and I am begging that guy to swap his seat with this child.
