This is the story of the most terrifying set of circumstances that I have ever lived through, and I hope nothing will ever top it, but I may not be so lucky. I hope that writing this down and sharing it may help me make some more sense out of what has been happening, or at the very least help me share the burden with someone else. I’ve changed names and been vague about locations for anonymity, but here is my story written down in as much detail as I can remember.



This all surrounds a trip that I took to my family’s ranch at the end of last summer. I had taken the time off college to work and save some money for the next semester. I live in Idaho, but my family owns a decent-sized ranch in eastern Oregon. Both to help out the family and make some money, I usually spend at least a few weeks out of the summer working there each year. I love the time out in the fields and forests, away from the bustle of urban life. For this trip, I had planned to spend about two weeks there staying with my uncle, aunt and cousins who live there.



I was leaving on a Sunday, but because of some unexpected things coming up I didn’t get on the road until after 8 pm, which meant it would be getting dark as I drove. I wasn’t too worried, though, as I had made the drive several times and knew every turn by heart. The drive is about four hours and feels like a departure from one world into another, from the cities and suburbs to where you can go for miles and only see the light of the stars and your headlights.



I listened to the radio for the whole drive; I grew up on radio and my car doesn’t have Bluetooth anyway, so it works out. I can pick up the Idaho stations for most of the way, but the second half usually has a slimmer selection of stations as the rolling hills start to break up the signal. This led to the first weird occurrence. At this point in the drive, the sun had long since set. The empty, rolling landscape, decorated only by sagebrush, wire fences and the occasional stream, stretched out into darkness on either side, with the lonely ribbon of road running before me. My headlights aren’t LED, so I only had a modest amount of warm light in front of me to see by. Whatever station I had been listening to had finally gotten too static-filled for me to pretend that it was intelligible, so I pressed the ‘seek’ button on my radio. This makes it roll through all of the FM frequencies until it finds a station with a strong enough signal to stop on. The numbers wound up quickly on the display until it looped back around to the bottom and worked its way back up. Finally, the numbers froze on a station- I wish I could remember the number. The only phrase that came through was- “...satanic manifestations.” That startled me a bit. After a pause, the speaker continued. It turned out to be some radio pastor rambling on about these manifestations interrupting his broadcast. I let out a nervous laugh; it was kind of funny to me that those were the first words it happened to pick up, but it was still a bit unsettling.



The drive kept going as normal, with me peering out into the night to make out the road lines. By this point, I was less than an hour away from the ranch. I was trying to enjoy a somewhat broken-up Michael Jackson song when another station crackled into clarity. This happens when two stations use similar frequencies; their ranges can sometimes overlap a bit and cause you to pick up both on top of each other. What caught my attention was that the other station was broadcasting the emergency alert system tone, which is like a series of grating and drawn-out beeps. Seriously, just look up ‘EAS alert system sound’ and tell me that it wouldn’t freak you out a bit to hear it when you’re driving through the forest alone at night. Even more concerning was that the station faded away again before I could hear what the alert was even for. At this point, I was just trying to get to the ranch as quickly as safety would allow so I could get this over with.



The rest of the drive passed fairly uneventfully, although I did still feel a bit uneasy as I drove up the gravel driveway and pulled up to the guest house that I would be staying in. Fortunately, a night of rest helped with that, and by the next day I had almost forgotten both occurrences, only thinking about how they might make for a good story. I left them in this account in case anybody thinks there’s some kind of connection between them and what happens later, but we’ll get into that.



The first few days of ranch work were enjoyable. Most days I would just be walking in the forest alone fixing fences, which may sound foreboding given the context that I’m sharing this in, but at the time it was honestly a lot of fun. I would just pack a lunch, drive a few miles out on the property, and spend the day enjoying the pleasant weather and forests of reaching pine trees. We keep several hundred head of cattle at our ranch, so we need plenty of fenced property to rotate them through so that they always have enough grass to eat. The ranch takes in a lot of area ranging from marshy lowlands to rocky and tree-lined ridges, much of which can only be traversed on foot. Every year, elk break wires jumping over the fences or trees fall and flatten them, so it all needs regular maintenance. It’s not particularly exciting, but like I said, the time outside was wonderful. I could walk and work all day without seeing anyone.



The area has had some sketchy stuff happen; a ranch hand from another ranch once told me a story about finding a cooler full of cocaine in a culvert. Apparently a major drug trade route connecting Mexico with Canada runs through the area, so sometimes stuff happens. But while smuggled drugs are pretty easy to explain, some stuff is not- which leads me to the mutilations.



One morning we got a call from our ‘neighbor’ (they lived miles away, but we shared a property line) about a bull that they had found dead in a field bordering ours. They wanted us to take a look at it, so we hopped in the truck and drove over and out into the field. They were parked out in the sagebrush, and as I got closer, I could see the corpse of the bull lying on the ground. The normally stocky animal now looked like the mammalian equivalent of a rotting pumpkin. When I took a closer look, it only got worse. The eyes were just gaping black sockets, and the lips had been completely stripped away to reveal only grinning yellow teeth. Our neighbor told us that the tongue and testes were also missing. Perhaps strangest of all, the wounds looked more like deliberately precise cuts than the tearing bites of animals.



“No blood either,” he said, “not a drop as far as I could see.” He was right; despite the multiple missing body parts, the ground looked clean; the grass wasn’t even matted or torn as if the animal had thrashed around. I have seen dead animals before, but this was just eerie.



In the end, we couldn’t come to any conclusions as to what might have happened to the bull. This spot was well away from both our house and the neighbor’s, so neither of us had heard or seen anything at all. There had been six living bulls the day before, now there were five. It can be a serious financial blow to a ranch to lose a breeding bull. It’s more than just the value of the single animal; the potential calves it could sire with its certain genetic traits are also factored in. For cattle, horses, and other animals, the market for genetic material is fairly lucrative. We could really sympathize with our neighbor, but there didn’t seem to be anything that could be done except to call the sheriff to examine the scene, so we left.



My Uncle and I chatted on the drive back to the ranch house, and I was surprised to learn that this was by no means an isolated incident. Just look up ‘oregon cattle mutilations’ if you want to see more, but don’t go to images if you don’t want to see anything graphic. It’s not just Oregon, either; for decades, there have been instances of cattle, often bulls, dying mysteriously, with body parts removed with seemingly deliberate precision. Some people say it’s aliens, and while I never believed that, the truth is that once you get out and see some stuff in the more isolated places of the world, stuff that most people will never see in their lives, it can be pretty hard to come up with any rational explanation.



Life at the ranch went on as usual. We didn’t hear anything more about the bull, and I almost forgot about it. Several nights later, my cousin Liam and I went out after sunset to hunt coyotes, since they can be a threat to the young calves and we had had a few births that week. My uncle bought both a thermal rifle scope and a thermal monocular to help hunt them in the dark since night or early morning is the best time. I’ve been out working until sunset many times, and just about every night around then you can hear the coyotes calling to each other from the hills and forests- not in harmony like wolves, but more like some crazy war cry. It can be pretty unsettling, but you feel a lot safer with a rifle in your hands. They are also much smaller than wolves and don’t really pose a threat to adult humans since they usually flee at the first sign of one.



It gets cold out there quickly after the sun goes down, even in the summer, so we layered up before heading out. The chill night wind swept across the unseen sagebrush while the stars twinkled faintly above. We drove out to the big hay barn at the center of the fields before setting out on foot. The field we were scouting is a rectangle, not quite a mile from east to west and half that north to south, with the south fence going right up to the trees and the edge of our property. We were laying flat on the dirt road running across the north end of the field, looking south towards the woods about six hundred yards away.



The only thing we could see without our thermal optics were the night sky and the distant lights of the ranch house, but through them, the darkened landscape showed up in spectral black and white. The warmer something is, the more white it appears with the thermal, while the coldest things are pure black; you can look up videos of white hot thermal on YouTube to get a better idea of what I’m talking about. The details weren’t incredibly crisp, but it was enough to distinguish between a cow and a coyote.



As any hunter will tell you, hunting is a lot of waiting. We laid there for at least thirty minutes, slowly rolling between laying on our backs and our stomachs to see all around us. It was fully dark now, with the horizon above where the sun had set showing only fading traces of lighter sky while the cold stars wheeled by. Finally, I spotted a lone coyote slink out of the dense forest past the fence to the south and lope along the tree line. I had the monocular, so my cousin brought the rifle around to line up a shot. It was still further away than we wanted to shoot for, so we decided to wait for it to come closer in search of lone calves. Even with it so far away, we were taking every precaution to stay undetected, speaking in the lightest of whispers and pressing ourselves flat to the earth, only just peering over the rise of the dirt road.



Suddenly, the coyote jerked its head to look behind it, then darted off back into the forest, quickly vanishing from sight. I sighed in frustration; we had already been out here in the cold for a while, and I was really hoping to nail that one and go home. If it didn’t come back soon, we would just have to go home to bed without success since we would still have to get up for work early in the morning. My cousin told me to keep watch in case it came back while he scoped out the fields to the north of us.



I was diligently scanning the distant digital tree line when I came across the most creepy, uncanny thing I have ever seen. Just past the fence, weaving through the last trees at the edge of the woods, were six people. They were moving steadily and purposefully in a line, and I couldn’t see their faces. The thing that was so creepy is that no one should have been there. Not only was it after dark, but the people who owned that property south of us had it for a vacation cabin that they only seldom used- and I knew for a fact that they weren’t there. There was no reason for six people to be out there marching through the dark.



I frantically tapped Liam’s shoulder and pointed him in the direction of the people. He followed my gesture through his scope (following all necessary gun safety). I knew when he saw them too because he breathed out a quiet “what the…” before looking back over at me.



“Who are they?” I asked in a frantic whisper.



“I don’t know, I can’t think of anyone else who would be out here.”



“Well- where could they be going?”



We kept watching to find out. They were moving steadily east, and it looked like they were carrying things. Without warning, they all stopped, standing as if frozen in place. It looked like they were looking around. Then, just as quickly as they had appeared, they melted back into the black shadows of the trees. The forest was still and dark.



“What should we do?” I asked, still not daring to talk above a whisper.



“I don’t know … I mean, it’s not our property, so it’s not like we can really do anything about it. Maybe those were just the people who live there.”



“No way man,” I responded. “And what would they be doing tramping around in the forest at night, and without any lights either?”



“I don’t know. I think we should just go back to the house,” Liam answered nervously. “No matter who they were, they definitely scared off all the coyotes. They probably won’t come back for hours.”



We slowly crawled back from the road, then walked back in a crouch to the truck. I kept looking over my shoulder with the monocular, but I didn’t see or hear a thing. We drove back to the house and went to bed, but I couldn’t sleep. This was supposed to be our private oasis, and the thought of these mysterious strangers stalking around in the dark seemed like a violation of that privacy, even though we hadn’t seen them come onto our property. I just couldn’t shake that eerie feeling that the whole experience had given me.



When we told my uncle in the morning, he just said “huh” and nothing more, though it didn’t seem like he had any more of an explanation than we did. We had breakfast and got started with the morning work as usual, working through until lunchtime. When I came back to the house for lunch, I could see that my uncle was upset about something, and he didn’t waste any time sharing. Our neighbor had found another dead bull that morning, in a similar state of mutilation to the first one- missing body parts with apparently purposeful cuts. Worse yet, it had been found in the same field as before, just east of us, and I immediately remembered that the people I had seen the night before had been moving east and could have easily been headed to that field. I brought this up to him.



“Yeah, I thought of that, too. I don’t know if there’s any way they are connected, but there’s no way that it’s not suspicious.”



To sum up the rest of that day, we told our neighbor about the people in the woods and he called the sheriff’s department to report the new incident. From what we heard from our neighbor, the sheriff just said to maybe move the cattle somewhere where they could keep a better eye on them and check the fences, which we all thought was a pretty stupid answer given that we had two witnesses of a group of mysterious people in the area the previous night. Even so, we spent the rest of the day working through the pouring rain and thick mud to move our bulls into the pasture right between the guest house, where I was staying, and the main house so that we could keep a closer watch on them.



While we were working, I was talking to Liam and my other cousin Gavin about everything that had happened and our theories about the mutilations and the people in the woods. Apparently one of the other popular explanations for the bull attacks historically are cults that harvest the organs for rituals. This probably came about because of the ‘satanic panic’ of the 80’s and 90’s, but in my mind, it would explain the mysterious people, certainly better than aliens. On top of that, Liam said he had heard of a cave in the area where a cult gathered to do cult stuff. He had never been to that particular cave himself, and it could just be local superstitions and ghost stories, but to me it just added to the rest of the circumstantial evidence, as well as calling to mind the weird radio experience from my drive there. Either way, the rest of what happened might help to draw a final conclusion.



The following night, I was at the guest house I was sharing with Gavin getting ready for bed. We each had our own room, with the window of mine looking out to the small front porch. I closed the blinds since there was a bright light in the center of the yard in front of the house, but one of the slats was broken off at the end, leaving a small square gap to the outside. I was still having trouble falling asleep and tossed and turned for an hour. As I rolled over once more to try and get comfortable, I saw an eye looking through the gap.



I yelped and fell out of bed. I grabbed the revolver from my nightstand, but didn’t think I was actually going to use it; there was no telling who was out there. Instead I yelled to Gavin in the other room to wake up.



“What is it?” I heard him grumble.



“There’s someone on the porch, they’re looking through the window!” I yelled, my voice cracking in fright.



Before I could say anything else, a rock crashed through the window, sending the blinds swinging wildly and shards of glass all over the bed and carpet. I screamed again and crawled backward to the door as fast as I could.



My cousin threw open his door, now wide awake from the noise. We both retreated into his room and slammed the door, hearing footsteps on the front porch. He checked his window looking out on the back porch, but didn’t see anything. We then called my uncle in the main house to ask for help.



After a couple of long minutes, we heard the truck roll up in front of the house and saw beams from their lights illuminating the interior. Both of us still in our pajamas, we stepped outside onto the front porch to meet him. Liam was with him and they both had rifles, but there was no one else in sight. If it wasn’t for the shattered window, you would never know someone had been there. Or that’s what I thought until Liam shined his flashlight on the ground.



All around the guest house, there were hundreds of trampled footprints in the mud, crossing over each other in a confused ring. I knew for certain that we had not made these tracks; I hadn’t gone around the house all day. I don’t know if they were from lots of people or just one who had been pacing around the house incessantly, and I don’t know which one freaked me out more.



We were all pretty spooked, but we loaded up into our two trucks with spotlights and proceeded to search the entire area around the houses. We looked for over an hour, but didn’t find  anything. The whole property had foot- and hoofprints all over from the day’s work, which kept us from being able to find out where the tracks around the guest house may have come from or gone off to. After a while, we all just returned back to the main ranch house to try and get some sleep. Gavin and I dragged out sleeping bags and slept fitfully on the floor.



For now, that’s about all I have to tell. First thing the next morning, we reported the incident to the sheriff’s department, but I wasn’t going to stick around any longer than I had to. I gave my statement over the phone and left my number with the station before packing up to leave. Call me a coward, but I wasn’t going to stay another night at the property. I told my aunt, uncle and cousins that we had plenty of room for them in Idaho if they wanted to get out of there too, but they wanted to stay at their home, so I didn’t push them.



The daylight drive back home was uneventful, and I kept the radio off the whole way. I slept better that night knowing I had put a few hundred miles between me and the eye watching me through the window. I was still shaken up for a while and it’s not until I’ve written all of this out that I’ve really come to terms with everything that happened. The more I’ve written, the more I’m sure of one thing- I need to go back to the ranch. Something is happening out there that we’ve only scratched the surface of, something that is threatening my family and their livelihood, not to mention the other ranchers in the valley. The only way that I’ll truly be able to have peace is to figure out who is stalking the woods, who is watching my family, and what is happening to the bulls at night.
