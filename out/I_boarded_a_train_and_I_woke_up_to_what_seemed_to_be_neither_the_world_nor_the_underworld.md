My name is Carrisa, I'm a 23-year-old, I'm studying at Central university, my university is far from city, so I board a train to go there, it usually takes me 3-4 hours to get there, and I return at midnight. I hate university if I have to be honest. It's not just that I'm lonely, It's a weird building overall. Something always seems off about it, I don't trust those high rising towers, bricked by dirty yellow and covered in cobwebs and dust. 

It is the middle of January and the nights have grown longer and colder. I came back from my last lecture and ran into an old group of friends, we chatted a while and I lost track of time. By the time I reached the station it was pitch black, Not many people around, It felt eerie. Only because the station was really lively when it was early. 

I boarded the train, The section I sat in had only 2 other people, A young blonde woman with a baby, She seemed to have these *uncanny doll-ish eyes*. They seemed too *fake* but too animated to be fake. I noticed her blinks were off-beat but then I realized I shouldn't stare. The other person was a brunette man, he wore a mask and his hair covered his eyes partially, He seemed to be young too, He had a large bag in his hand. I sat down and put my head against the glass, slowly dozing off as I felt the train moving.   


*CLICK . CLICK . CLICK*  


A noise disturbed my sleep, I opened my eyes to a pitch black train and a freezing atmosphere, I realized I fell asleep and I started to panic '*Am I stuck ?' 'How do I get out ?'..* I stood up trying to understand how to get out of here. I walked around and found a door to the panel, I pushed it open, And to my surprise it opened with possibly the most annoying scraping sound ever, like the ones the doors make at night but only more *screech-ey*.   


I stepped outside, jumping from the stairs, It was pitch black, The scene was still, No lights, no person, Nothing. Only a mechanical buzzing from the train, I turned around to have a look, The train seemed so much weirder, It had rust all over it and it seemed like it hadn't been used, And I began to panic a lot. I turned around again, I don't know what I expected, It felt *unreal, eerie, weird,* I felt like pinching myself, It felt like a dream. I kicked hard on the ground, I picked up a rock and hit myself with it a couple of times out of frustration.   


It was real, It was all real. I don't know how or why but it was. I stumbled around, I didn't want to go anywhere away from the train, But maybe I was just on another station ? Maybe I was only a bit far away from my home, So with the decision I walked along the train-tracks, My eyes adjusted to the dark well and I was able to make out bushes, trees, a grassland and the scene seemed to continue from there, It was all the same, *bushes, trees, grassland. bushes, trees, grassland.* And the same train track I followed. No lights, No houses, No animals, No humans, No sign of any life from anywhere. Just pitch black darkness, the same never ending scene and the train behind me.   


I walked for a while and the more I gazed into the same scene, the more I became anxious. There was no sign of any life from anywhere, How had the train ended up here ? I brushed off the questions and thought maybe it would be better to stay beside the train until morning. I also realized I had forgotten my bag, I might have some battery left in my phone. So I walked back, my eyes pierced into the darkness and my anxiety made me frantically run back. I stepped inside the train panel, And grabbed my bag, I found my phone and checked the time '*3:33'* It was really late. I dialed the emergency number. '***The service is out of order, Please try again*** ***~~l~~******at******~~er-r-r-errr'~~*** *click.* I guess I had no hope now, I had the only choice of hiding here until it's morning. And then suddenly I heard whistling.  


*It was loud, Very loud, It seemed to echo around the place, And it was creepy enough for a sane person to whistle so loudly in the dead of night.* But I went outside, To feed my curiosity, But as they say, *'Curiosity kills the cat'.* I looked around, The whistling stopped, I stumbled across the train tracks, behind the train, But nothing. And then I heard the whistle.  


***Behind me.***  


I turned around, And what I saw, I cannot describe but what I can is what I felt, I felt like gouging my eyes out and smashing my head, I felt my hair stand up, I didn't take a moment to stop and run back into the train, I stumbled around the panels and sat down under a seat, And hid as best I could. The whistling grew louder, I hated it, I wanted it to end. But It didn't, It found me and the last thing I saw was its sick, *terrifying*, twisted grin, laced with its blood and flesh. *I wish It was a dream.*
