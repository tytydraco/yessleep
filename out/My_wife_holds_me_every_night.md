It was time for my favorite part of the day. At night is when I get to be with my wife.

As usual Emilia would come in the room around midnight, she’d lie down next to me, then she’d scooch over and hold me.

“How’s my big man doing today?” She said as she pressed her cheeks into mine.

“Oh you know how it is. Just getting by, one day at a time. I missed you though”

“Oh I know honey, I missed you too. This is our time now. And we can’t waste it.”

I turned over and faced her, then gently kissed her lips.

“I wouldn’t want to be anywhere but here my love.” I said with a hint of melancholy in my trembling voice.

We held each other until she had to leave in the morning.

I got a light headache I had to eat properly and all I had was cereal. I prepared some corn flakes and ate it in bed. It was still morning, I had no job to go to, and I couldn’t wait to see Emilia again.

I decided to just sleep now so that I could be awake when she comes later at night.

“Hey honey”

I woke up to her beautiful voice.

“Emilia, I’m so happy to see you” I turned my head and found her holding me in her arms.

“How’s my big man doing today?”

My heart ached for a split second.

“You already asked me that yesterday honey.”

“Oh I’m sorry, I’ll say something else. I hope you had a good day?”

“Not really, I just waited for you. This would be the highlight of it actually.”

She chuckled. “You know this would be the highlight of my day too.”

I suddenly got a huge migraine, the pain was so intense.

“Are y-ou ok-ay ho-ney?” Said Emilia, as her voice began to crack.

“Yeah. It's going away now. I feel better. Let me look at you again”

I held her face in my hands and stared into her oddly quivering eyes. Then turned back around and let her hold me again. I slept like a baby.

The next day I took some aspirin and patiently waited for her all day.

It was midnight again. She opened the bedroom door right on cue.

“Hey there my love. How was your day?”

“Can you maybe start asking different questions? It’s getting a little repeti- - -”

A sharp sudden pain in my head interrupted me.

“I’-m sor-ry hon-ey, I’-ll w-or-k o-n t-h-a-t” She began glitching out.

“No honey, please don’t”

“Wha-t’s h-ap-p-eni-ng?” She said as she completely vanished.

A hologram appeared in front of me.

After I finished sobbing, I lay in bed all alone. I made a new email and applied for a new trial. I couldn’t afford to have my wife hold me every night.
