Of all the bizarre things that have happened to me throughout my life, yinz would think finding a cake waiting for me on my doorstep would be low on my list. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

Yup. A cake. Decorated with badly drawn flowers made of pink frosting. Clearly homemade. There was no note. No label on the box it was in. No way to discern who the baker could've been. 

Naturally, I found this suspicious. I brought it inside and cut it open, looking for razor blades, broken glass, or some other nasty surprise hidden within. Nothing. Just a seemingly ordinary cake that smelled lightly of vanilla. Of course, it could've been poisoned, but I didn't have the resources to check for something like that, and I certainly wasn't about to find out the hard way. 

Right off the bat, I thought I could rule Iolo out. He doesn't strike me as the ‘baked goods type.’ He seems more like the kind of deranged suitor to leave someone's head on my doorstep. 

The clock chimed. Realizing that I was about to be late for work, I thought it best to leave the mystery cake on the table. If it was a gift from a Neighbor, throwing it away could be taken as an insult. Best to leave it be, until I could figure out who or what left it. 

The odd gift was one of the first things I mentioned to my coworkers. They all felt the same way I did. Unfortunately, with nothing to identify the baker, there wasn't anything we could do, for the moment. We'd just have to wait and see.  

This was the day after the Muse incident, so I was already on edge. Throughout the morning, snippets of the incident would haunt me like scenes from a demented movie. My jaw ached, marked by little circular bruises on the side of my chin from where Iolo had grabbed me. And any time that kiss came to mind, it would ache more from the way I'd tense up with anger. 

Of all Neighbors to take an interest in me… It had to be the one that would, at best, only ever see me as a pet. Something to be broken in and trained to suit him. 

I hate him. I truly do. 

After everything that had happened, I was absolutely dreading my meeting with the mechanic. Granted, I didn't look forward to them before that night, but after everything, I think I honestly would've rather attended my own funeral. For one, I didn't know how I could face him after his admission. For another, I couldn't decide if I was more afraid of his violence or his affection. 

What was most unfortunate was that I knew I couldn't avoid it. As awful as willingly walking into the bear’s den was, I knew that the consequences of standing the bear up would be far worse. 

Before I went to the skull trees, I got creative. First, I put on some lip balm, then patted on a thin layer of fine popcorn salt with my finger. That way, if he made a move on me again, he'd regret it. It would most likely end with me in the hospital, sure, but at that point, a broken bone was the preferable option.

And in case yinz were wondering: yes, my lips were *very* dry afterwards. That was six days ago and the skin still feels too tight. It even cracked in the corner of my mouth, which combined with the salt, did *not* feel great. *Ow.*

With my protective cosmetics in place, I ventured out to the skull trees, surprised to find that the mechanic hadn't brought an instrument to amuse himself with that time. He was simply staring at the stars above us in his folding chair, one arm behind his head while his injured hand, wrapped in gauze, rested in his lap. 

He greeted me without taking his eyes off the glittering night sky, “Surprised you showed up. I was thinkin’ I'd have to come after ya.”

*Like I had a choice.*

After his talk of ‘muzzling’ me, there was a part of me that was afraid to speak up for myself. But at the same time, I still hadn't wrapped my head around what had happened. *Any* of it. 

So I started off by asking, “I thought you said you hated me?”

He rose from his seat, sighing before he responded, “Oh, I do. That hasn't changed.”

“So what was yesterday, then?”

He glanced thoughtfully up at the stars again before he replied, “Well, pup, I can't stand you, but at the same time I can't stand the idea of anyone else gettin’ to ya.”

Spoken like someone who is extremely well-adjusted. 

I wasn't sure how to handle it. Some of yinz called it ‘love,’ but I'm not sure someone like him is capable of love, especially not towards someone he deems inferior to him. 

Feeling ashamed even before the words even left my mouth, I asked, “Is there anything I can do to convince you not to do this?”

A chill spread through my gut, making my agonized jaw tighten yet again as his words from the day before came to mind, *’You may be a biter, puppydog, but at least now you know how to beg.’*

And now I was on the verge of begging him again. I hate him. *God,* I hate him. 

The mechanic let out a soft snort, “Now, this is just *sad.*”

There was so much I wanted to say about how I was terrified of having my humanity stripped away, how I didn't belong to him, how he just quite simply *couldn't do this.* But it was useless. Words were useless. I just let them all die within me. 

His eyes bored into mine, a small smile on his lips as he commented, “What I wouldn't give to be able to get into that head o’ yours right now.”

I was glad he couldn't. More than ever. 

He was far too nonchalant as he then asked, “We didn’t get to finish this, so I’ll ask again: what’s up with you and that keening woman?”

*Shit.* A chill settled in my gut. If I said the wrong thing, what would he do to her?

“I see her the same way as I do my coworkers.” I replied honestly. 

The mechanic chuckled, “You know, that's the first time you've ever lied to me!”

*What?!* I felt the air become thinner. Lies aren't tolerated even by the best of Neighbors. And the worst part was that I hadn't been dishonest. I knew better than to make that fatal mistake, always have. 

“I'm not-” I started to insist.

“Don't worry, I ain't mad ‘bout it.” He interrupted, that smile not faltering. “‘Specially since you're lyin’ to yourself as well.”

Quickly, I shook my head, “I care about her like I care about many other people.”

“Don't get yourself all worked up. I can't kill her.” He said, still clearly not believing a word I said. “Be much easier if I could, but rules are rules, y'know?” 

That wasn't reassuring in the slightest. There was a lot he could do to someone without killing them, especially another immortal. 

“She has nothing to do with this.” I tried to keep my tone even, not wanting to prove his point. “This is between us.”

“Is it, pup?” He still didn't seem angry. Once again, this was all a joke. “Hasn't stopped her from insertin’ herself in our affairs. Gotta say, this is real awfully cruel of you. *Caoineadh* has risked life and limb for you, and still, you deny her. You might be a better Hunter than you thought you were!”

“Just leave her alone, alright?” I snapped, the fear of someone I care about being hurt surpassing my fear of him. 

His grin widened, “*There* she is! I was gettin’ sick of that kicked puppy act.”

I ignored him, “You're already getting what you want. You have no reason to go after her or anyone else.”

“Is that so?” He asked with a laugh. “I know you. You're not the type to just give up. If you were, I wouldn't be wastin’ my time.”

“Are you that threatened?” I challenged. “By a gentle Neighbor that merely wants to right her previous wrongs? Seems a bit below you.”

“Not at all,” He said coolly, producing a four-leaf clover, twirling it thoughtfully between his thumb and forefinger. “I've let that one go for a while. She’s just a failed protector of the dead. You know how many souls she coulda saved from us? But she's only saved one. One *you* cared about.”

I knew better than to bring up Deirdre’s deeds outside of his reach. She was already in danger. I didn't need to make things worse for her. 

“Even more reason for you to not waste your time.” I insisted. 

Abruptly, still toying with the clover, he said, “You know why things turned out so bad for you yesterday, pup?”

Feeling my blood pressure skyrocket, I snapped, “What do I have to do to get you to stop calling me ‘puppydog?’”

He looked amused once again, “Ask.”

It took massive effort not to roll my eyes. “Alright. Would you mind referring to me as Fiona?”

No harm in using that old name, especially since he knew it already. It held no power over me. Just the long-buried name of a mass murderer's daughter.  

“Well, *Fiona,* yesterday you both impressed me *and* disappointed me. You did real good with that Muse right up ‘til the end. But then you went and held that sword up at me not once, but *twice.* Now, don't make the mistake of thinkin’ that I held back from breakin’ that jaw of yours outta compassion. Injury like that is nothin’ to us, but to you? That's a setback. One we don't need with Samhain right around the corner. However, you've gotten way too comfortable, and that's on me. I loosened up on that leash o’ yours a bit too much. Goin’ forward, those casual attempts on my life are gonna hurt, setbacks be damned. You understandin’ me?”

I nodded, the chill in my gut telling me that he was serious. 

For a moment, he was quiet, as if expecting me to say something. I didn't. What was there to say? 

The mechanic sighed, stepping forward to hand me the clover, “Right. I'm done talkin’. Let's get started.”

That training session was harder than the previous ones, now that I'd proven that I could land a hit on him. Thankfully, his wing still hadn't fully recovered yet, so while his hits were harder and faster than what I was used to, his dodges were somewhat off balance. Unfortunately, he didn't give me any opportunities to hurt him that time. But fortunately, he also didn't try to kiss me again. While I was relieved, at the same time, that meant I mummified my lips for nothing.
 
Throughout the session, my mind kept warning me about Deirdre. She was in my apartment, waiting for me to get done with Iolo for our dance. She'd told me not to take on her problems, but how could I not when I was directly responsible for this one? He'd said himself that he wouldn't be paying her any mind if it weren't for me. 
 
Once we were done, I hurried to meet her, glancing in my rearview mirror far too often to make sure I didn’t see his truck behind me. I was the only vehicle on the road.

Deirdre was, once again, reading when I got in. There was a part of me that had been worried that he’d beat me home, get to her before I could. I was relieved to be wrong.

“You can wear a hagstone, can’t you?” I asked.

Her brows furrowed, “Yes, why?”

“I think you might need it. We need to hurry.”

Still frowning, she set the book aside.

“What’s this about?” Deirdre asked softly as she followed me out to the Jeep. “Your grandfather?”

“No,” I replied quickly, glancing around in paranoia as I got it started. No truck. No music playing. If I’d heard banjo or fiddle playing right then, I might’ve had a heart attack.

“Then what is it? Nessa, please just tell me.” 

“Let me get us moving first.” I muttered urgently.

Unexpectedly, so much so that I flinched, her fingers brushed against the side of my hand. I swallowed back the lump in my throat as I took it, grateful for that small comfort. 

How does she do that? How is just a slight touch able to make standing on the threshold of Hell feel more bearable?

*Maybe Iolo is right. About me being in denial about her.*

No. If I let myself care about her too much, I’d be condemning her. I’d be putting her in harm’s way.

“*Nessa,*” My sharply spoken fake name broke into my frenzied thoughts. “You need to talk to me. I can’t help you unless you do.”

No use sugarcoating it. I just said it, “He thinks I’m in love with you and I’m afraid that he might be right.”

Oh, that came out so stupid. So *fucking* stupid. A love confession I wasn’t even a hundred percent sure that I meant during a potential life or death scenario. Jesus Christ. 

While she was clearly taken aback, I stammered, “Hold on. I don’t know if it’s love, that’s a hell of a word to throw around, but I do care. *I do.* I just - I can’t think right now.”

Leave it to me to make a situation worse.

“Is that why we’re running for a hagstone?” She asked gently. “You don’t need to protect me. I’ve told you before that I can handle myself and I meant it. The last thing I want is to be one more thing that keeps you from sleeping at night. You already have enough trouble as it stands.”

“How can I not?” It came out harsher than I meant it. I shook my head. “Crap, I’m sorry!”

“We’ll look for a stone, if it’ll make you feel better. And for what it’s worth, Nessa, I care about you, too.”

Don’t ask me why tears came to my eyes. I don’t know why either. “Don’t say that.”

“Why not?” She was rightfully irritated.

“Love never works out for the women in my family.” I reminded her. “I’d be an idiot if I ever thought it would ever be different with me.”

“Stop for a moment.”

Hesitantly, I fought the paranoia and did as she said, the *tick! tick!* of my hazard lights being the only sound in the Jeep for a few seconds as I pulled over.

Once stopped, Deirdre made me look at her, “Curses are made to be broken. You’ve gone out of your way to break mine, so allow me to help you break yours. You’ve trusted me to aid you in the past. What makes this any different?”

“It’s not that I don’t trust you.” I explained, trying to swallow that damned stubborn lump again. “It just feels selfish to pull you into my mess yet again. You’ve already done so much.”

“My father killed all those people because he was convinced my mother left him for another man,” I confessed. “At least, that’s what was said in police interviews. I didn’t even know I had a grandpa until we found those pictures, all because the Muse became jealous of what he had with my grandma. And it’s going to happen again.”

“It *won’t.*” 

I forced myself to take a deep breath, one that came out more shaky than intended. With one hand in hers, the other went to the corners of my eyes to stop the tears from falling.

“Huntsmen are quite good at this,” Deirdre said softly, her thumb comfortingly stroking against the back of my hand. “Making their quarry feel isolated. I imagine that this reaction was the desired outcome. To frighten you into submission.”

The breaking down process. It never stopped.

“Still want to find a stone?” She asked.

“Yes.” I said without hesitation. 

Even if this was just another head game, I didn't want to take the chance. It definitely couldn't hurt anything. It would at least offer some peace of mind. 

We found more than just a hagstone in the woods that night. 

Something had seemed off from the moment we arrived. No frogs or crickets chirping. No one else parked nearby. Not a good sign. Deirdre seemed to share my unease, suggesting we stay near each other. I agreed, keeping a hand on Ratcatcher’s hilt as we proceeded into the eerily still forest, following the sound of the river.

We made it to the river’s edge uninterrupted, though that ominous feeling hadn’t subsided. 

Deirdre removed her borrowed shoes and socks before jumping into the water, her eyes darting about watchfully. I put my back to her, keeping a lookout behind us in case we were followed. 
A breeze whistled through the trees, carrying the scent of freshly baked cookies along with it.

“Do you smell that?” I asked Deirdre.

“I do.” Her voice was grave. 

“Do you know what’s causing it?”

“I might, though I hope that I’m wrong.”

Well, that wasn’t promising.

I’d turned in the direction the scent had come from, seeing nothing in the darkness. Deirdre continued to trudge through the river, searching for a hagstone all the while. She’s been able to find one fairly quickly last time. I hoped she could do it again.

Movement by one of the trees. It was still there. I shone my flashlight on it. A heart-shaped cookie hung from a pink ribbon on the tree branch, its frosting and colorful sprinkles smudged. Shining my light around, I saw another cookie, also secured by a ribbon to a tree a bit further on.

My mom’s story from when I was a kid came back to me. A trail of treats, leading deeper and deeper into the woods. I knew that if I followed it, I’d find a house made of gingerbread.

I knew where that cake from that morning had come from, then. 

“No *fucking* way.” I breathed.

Why was it here? And why now? Its timing couldn't possibly be worse.

*Wait. How did it know we were going to be here? In this specific spot?* 

In case something went wrong, I quickly texted Victor, ears perked for any movement nearby. I told him everything: where we were and why, the gingerbread house, *everything.* For good measure, I also shared my location.

“I found one!” Deirdre announced. “I suppose that’s one positive to knowing this forsaken river so well.”

As she rolled her socks back up to her ankles, I told her of my discovery. She stiffened, her wide eyes following the beam of my flashlight to rest on the cookie dangling like bait in front of us.

“I didn’t want to be right.” She whispered. 

“We have to follow that trail.” I said. “It takes kids. It almost took me, once. I can’t let it stay here. Besides, it left me a gift this morning. I think it was waiting for us.”

Deirdre frowned up at me as she got to her feet. “That’s even more reason for us to leave.”

A voice floated through the night then. Wait. That was my grandmother’s voice. The smell of the sweets intensified. She was waiting for me. 

Deirdre’s hand in mine. What happened? I discovered that I’d moved closer to the cookie on the tree. The gingerbread house’s owner’s voice had changed, sounding more hollow. All of the warmth and familiarity it’d had previously had vanished.

“She can’t want anything good with you.” Deirdre warned.

“I know,” I replied. “But I have my sword, salt, and you. I don’t want to run from this thing again.”

Deirdre was hesitant, but probably figured that if she didn’t accompany me, my stubborn ass would be back out there again eventually. Besides, Victor knew the situation. At least one of my coworkers would be on their way soon enough.

With a sigh, we followed the trail of treats.

They weren’t covered in bugs and maggots like how they had been when my mother had followed the trail. These ones appeared to be somewhat fresh, baked within the last day or two. I’d wager that the cake had been made at the same time as the rest of them.

The house, on the other hand, was surrounded by a chorus of buzzing flies. The frosting lining the sides was crusted over from age. The gumdrops had lost their shape and it was a miracle that more hadn’t fallen off. Smoke drifted from the chimney.

*Please let it just be a fire. Please don’t let it be the oven.*

I clutched Dierdre’s hand tighter as we approached the front door, the nauseating smell of rotten sugar making me gag. Likewise, the Weeper was holding her sleeve over her nose.

The owner of the gingerbread house towered over us both. Red licorice whips clung to her scalp instead of hair. Her skeletal face beamed at us with cracked teeth, her head twisted backwards as her spindly body stayed stooped over its oven. The house smelled of old sugar and smoke. Thankfully, not cooked meat. At least she hadn’t taken anyone. Yet.

“My, how you’ve grown!” She crooned to me. “Though I must admit, with all the fuss being made about you, I’d thought you’d be prettier.”

*You’re one to talk.*

“You wanted us here, you got us.” I replied mildly.

“Your troubles are ordinary, yet not,” The homeowner said, her neck cracking as her body swiveled to face the same direction as her head. “You are the object of desire. Though, ‘object’ is a bit more literal, in your case. Rather than a man, your suitor is a dragonfly. A dragonfly bloated on power.”

A tapping sound got my attention then. A common blue dragonfly, trapped in a jar, bouncing along the confines of its glass prison. 

The homeowner snatched the jar off the wooden table, leering at the insect as she lamented, “Beautiful, ancient creatures.”

“Why am I here?” I asked patiently, though I regretted not following Dierdre’s advice about leaving the moment we saw that cookie.

“Before the dragonfly and its terrible army followed, I thrived here.” She tapped a long, yellowed fingernail on the glass, frightening the poor insect even more. “I wish to thrive again. I must move, now. I’m always moving. I’m unwelcome to those who live below the Mounds.”

The homeowner untwisted the lid of the jar then, clamping a hand over the top to keep it from escaping.

“The dragonfly owns you as it were,” She continued, her gnarled fingers cornering the insect as it squirmed frantically. I couldn't tear my eyes away from the poor thing as she dragged it out, holding its thorax between two fingers. In turn, Deirdre squeezed my hand, reminding me that I wasn’t dealing with this alone. “Though if you bring me its instrument, I can help you. I’m not particular about which one. Either will do.”

She smiled wider as she used two fingers to tug on the trapped dragonfly’s wings, pulling until it came off. The insect struggled. The homeowner set the wing down in a bowl on the table, then pinched another. 

*“Stop.”* I cut in. 

The homeowner ignored me, prying each wing off until the poor dragonfly, clearly agonized, was thrashing without a single one left. Its head was twisted off next before the body was discarded. 

The homeowner then added the bowl of wings to a cauldron, saying, “They’re beautiful, ancient creatures, yes, but not invincible. Yours is no different. Bring me the instrument, and your suitor will trouble you no more.”

I didn’t trust that. Not one bit. Quickly, we retreated from that terrible house, leaving the homeowner to her horrible concoctions. As we hurried off, Deirdre kept glancing over her shoulder as if expecting her to follow us. 

“I’m not doing it.” I hissed when I believed we were out of earshot. “That thing is *worse* than the mechanic. I can’t explain how I know, I just *know!*”

“You’re right about that.” She agreed quietly, as if also concerned about the homeowner overhearing. “She is dreadful, that one.”

My phone vibrated. Victor. 

I reiterated to him everything that had happened. Once I was finished, the first words out of his mouth were, “You didn’t accept her offer, did you?”


“No,” I quickly confirmed. “As much as i want this shit to end, I have to wonder if letting that *thing*  take over would be worse.”

“Okay,” He sounded relieved. “Tomorrow morning, we’ll all get together and figure this out. Whether you accept her offer or not, someone wanting to challenge the Wild Hunt is a recipe for trouble. For everyone.”

“How hard do you think it’ll be to drive this thing out?”

He sighed heavily, “I’m not sure, since before you told me about what happened when you were a kid, I haven’t heard about this gingerbread house creature outside of children’s bedtime stories. We’ll have to try, though.”

“I’ll help however I can.” Deirdre offered.

We both practically dove into the Jeep. After a flurry of seatbelts and the squeal of tires, I was burning rubber down the road.

Victor, still on loudspeaker, asked Dierdre what she knew about the gingerbread house's owner.

“She’s always hungry,” She informed us grimly. “She never stops eating, sometimes devouring entire villages, if uncontested. She knows secrets of the world that even the old gods of the forest are not privy to.”

“Oh, wonderful.” Was my brilliant commentary.

“But she is a coward.” Deirdre added. “That’s why she won’t approach the Huntsman herself. I suspect that when your company looks for her tomorrow, the house will be gone out of fear that the Hunt will have been alerted.”

“So that house is going to keep moving,” Victor thought out loud. “If the Hunters have trouble finding it, I imagine it’s not going to be much easier for us.”

“Unless she has a reason to stay in one place.” I said. “She thinks I can get one of the mechanic’s instruments. Hold on…”

There it was. A ray of hope. One that I’ve desperately needed.

“Does she present a real threat to the mechanic? Is she capable of killing him?” I asked Dierdre, practically light-headed as my tired mind worked out the details.

“Possibly.” She replied. 

Victor understood instantly. “He’d have to recognize the hag as a threat. And recognize you as his savior.”

Deirdre’s eyes went wide. 

I explained, “It’s risky, but… as of right now, this is the only opportunity I have to get out of this. Maybe the only one. He’ll have to believe he's truly in danger, but at the same time, I do *not* want to help that thing. So we’ll have to be careful.”

“What do you suggest?” Victor asked warily.

“Where did you find the mechanic’s banjo when you stole it that one time?”

“I doubt he’d be stupid enough to keep it in the same place since the first location was compromised.” Victor said. 

Hold on. That cabin. The one he took me to when he gave me Ratcatcher.

“I might know where it is.” I announced, but then I deflated. “But there’s just one problem: I have no idea how to get back there. He’d made damn sure of that.”

“You’ll have to be *very* careful and *very* clever.” Victor advised. “We can start working on it at the office.”

Once I hung up, Deirdre uttered, “You can do this. I know you can.”

I nodded, hoping that her faith wasn’t misplaced. The only thing I was certain of was that I was glad she’d been with me and I made sure to tell her so. 

So that’s how all five Orion employees ended up sitting in a circle at the office like we were at some church basement group therapy session. 

After explaining the situation, Victor asked me what I could remember about the cabin.

“I think it was in *their* world.” I explained, trying to picture the place in my mind. “There were only windows in the living room, like the place was built into the ground.”

“That’s not much.” Victor commented. 

“What about the Lovers’ Tree?” Reyna asked thoughtfully. “He and his murder birds guard it. That means something, right?”

Victor explained, mostly for the newer employees’ benefit. “Hawthorn trees are sacred to the Neighbors. It could be related, or it could merely be him protecting what’s essentially a temple to them.”

Cerri chipped in with a small shrug, “It’s worth a shot, isn’t it?”

“Or we’ll be wrong and we’ll *all* regret it, Nessa especially.” Victor cautioned. “We need to be sure of where the cabin is before we do anything.”

He was right. If we got caught, I was fucked come Samhain. I’d been warned about trying anything to alleviate the life debt in the past. My coworkers wouldn’t be much better off, either. 

“What if I get him to take me there again?” I suggested, even though the idea horrified me.

Wes finally contributed, rocking back on his chair thoughtfully, “If you can do that, I could always track your scent.”

Reyna blinked at him, “What an *incredibly* normal thing to say!”

He held his hands up, “I’m just saying that if she gets ketamined again, we can still find the place!”

“I’ll do what I can to get him to take me there.” I said, already dreading the upcoming weeks. “We’ll figure it out from there.” 

Needless to say, I was anxious for the next training session. But at least now, I didn’t feel so hopeless. 

I tried not to be so obvious as I eyeballed the fiddle the mechanic held. He was frowning at it.

“I remember why I stopped usin’ this thing,” He remarked, index finger tracing his lower lip thoughtfully. “For some reason, it just does *not* want to stay in tune. Probably somethin’ up with the pegs.”

I didn’t beat around the bush as I asked, “Would you know anything about someone who lives in a house made of gingerbread?”

His movements paused abruptly as he turned to narrow his eyes at me, “*Why?*”

The instant change in demeanor caught me off guard. “She approached me. About you.”

Silently, he put the fiddle into its case, mouth a hard, agitated line. 

“She offer ya somethin’?” He questioned, his tone clipped.

“Freedom from you.”

He laughed darkly. “Of course. That one has had her eye on this area for a while.”

“I didn’t accept it. Her offer, I mean.”

His smile was sardonic. “It tempted you though, didn’t it?”

“No.” I answered truthfully. “Believe it or not, I’m more afraid of her than I am of you.”

That appeared to surprise him. “Now, why is that?”

I let myself feel the nervousness that had been building up within me for days, but made sure not to ham it up. I had to be honest and vulnerable, but not over the top. He’s perceptive. He’d notice if I was acting. 

“She tried to take me as a kid.” I admitted. “In the woods, before one of my colleagues intervened, she’d enchanted me.”

He didn’t need to know Deirdre was the one with me. 

At that confession, Iolo’s gaze darkened, though his voice remained light. “That so?”

“I’m not sure if it was just to make that offer or if there was more in mind.” 

“Huh. Interesting.” Was his response. 

The seed had been planted. The idea that the hag would want to take what he thought was his. 

I know I’m playing a dangerous game. Manipulation doesn’t come to me as naturally as it does to him. And if he figures out what I’m up to - what *we’re* up to - it’s going to get ugly. 

But it’s more of a chance than I had before. We’ll just see if I can pull it [off](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/kvnRWF2wFv).
