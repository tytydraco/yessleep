I thought leaving the city, leaving him, leaving everything familiar, would give me some relief.

The Airbnb was tucked into the woods, far from the nearest town. No Wi-Fi, patchy cell service, just me, a cabin, and the damp smell of pine and rain. Perfect. I needed to vanish for a few days, to stop replaying our fights, the things I shouldn’t have said, the things I should have left unsaid.

Driving there, the rain-slicked roads made the world blur. Headlights reflected off the wet asphalt like tiny mirrors, fragments of my own reflection bouncing back at me. I hummed to keep myself awake, but my thoughts kept straying to him. To the last text I never replied to. To his laugh that felt like home and betrayal at once.

When I arrived, the cabin looked exactly like the photos—cozy, wooden, modest, with a small porch overlooking the river. Mist rolled off the water like a slow, persistent exhale. I pulled my bag from the trunk and hesitated on the steps. Silence stretched in every direction. I could feel it pressing against my ears, waiting.

Inside, it was warm, smelled faintly of wood polish, and smelled faintly like someone had lived here recently. I shrugged it off and unpacked. Lights, bedspread, kitchenware—all in order. I made myself a cup of coffee and sank into the corner of the couch, wrapped in a blanket. I wasn’t even halfway through the first sip when my phone buzzed.

Unknown: “Finally.”

My stomach dropped. I didn’t recognize the number. I dropped the phone, expecting it to be a mistake.

Unknown: “You’re here. I can see you.”

I froze. Checked every window. Nothing. The rain blurred the forest beyond. My heart began hammering. Maybe it was a prank. Maybe someone had hacked the Airbnb. Maybe I was losing it.

Hours passed. I unpacked, rearranged, tried to paint. Every time I moved, the phone buzzed again. Each message seemed impossibly precise:

Unknown: “The mug. You like it for the way it curves. You always use it first thing in the morning.”

I hadn’t told anyone about the mug. I hadn’t even packed it until a week ago. My hands shook as I set it down.

Unknown: “The blanket. Folded wrong. I fixed it.”

I ran to check. The corner was tucked neatly, the folds perfect. I didn’t do that.

The storm outside rattled the cabin walls. I paced. Every creak sounded like footsteps. Every rustle of leaves against the windows became a whisper. I tried calling my best friend, but no signal. Tried 911. Nothing.

At some point, I realized I hadn’t taken off my shoes. I set them down. When I returned five minutes later, they were angled differently, toes pointing toward the center of the room.

I tried reasoning. Maybe it was just a glitch. Maybe someone had remote access to the cabin’s smart lock, its lights, its tiny wifi-connected thermostat. Maybe… maybe I had imagined the whole weekend to begin with.

Then my phone buzzed again.

Unknown: “Why are you pretending this isn’t your idea?”

I stopped breathing. The words hung in the air, heavy, impossible. My own thoughts twisted into unfamiliar shapes. Did I subconsciously invite him here? Did I want this?

I fled to the bedroom, pulled the blanket over my head, shaking. Hours passed in silence punctuated only by the occasional buzz of my phone. Each message knew more than I thought I had told anyone.

Around 3 a.m., the final storm subsided. Mist hung low over the river. I peeked out the window. The forest was empty, serene. I told myself I was safe.

Then I noticed it: shadows moving just beyond the trees. Not humans, exactly—too tall, too still. Every time I blinked, they seemed closer. Gone when I looked again.

My phone buzzed one last time.

Unknown: “Welcome home.”

I haven’t returned since. I deleted the Airbnb account, blocked the number, tried to forget.

But sometimes, late at night, when everything is quiet and I’m alone, my phone buzzes. Just once.

Unknown: “Miss me?”

And I swear, even with the light on, I feel the faintest shift in the room—like the air itself is watching.

Sometimes I think it was never him at all. Maybe it was just… me.
