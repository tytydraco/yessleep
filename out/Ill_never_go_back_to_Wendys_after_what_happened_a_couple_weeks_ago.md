A few weeks ago, my wife texted me as I was on my way home and asked if I could pick up some Wendy’s for dinner.  We don’t usually do fast food, but we’ve both been really busy with work, and though it’s not my favorite, I wanted to make her happy, so Wendy’s it was.  When I got to the restaurant, the drive thru line was all the way around the entire restaurant, so I decided to go inside rather than wait in the long line.  

Walking into the restaurant I passed a car similar to mine, and laughed out loud as I thought to myself “We really need a car wash!”  When I entered the restaurant, I found out the reason for the long line outside.  It was that the register at the drive thru window was broken and the counter guy was trying his best to cover both.  When it was my turn, I ordered meals for my wife and I while the counter guy gave me the weirdest look.  He didn’t say anything, just looked at me with a very strange look.  

I paid for our meal and then moved to the side to fill our drink cups.  In what seemed to be just a second later, someone from the kitchen dropped a bag on the counter and called out the contents.  It was exactly what I ordered, so I thought it was mine and picked it up.  

After I grabbed the bag, I went back to filling up my drinks.  It was then that the guy who took my order at the register called me over and said “Hey man, I said your order is ready!” and plopped another bag on the counter.  I couldn’t understand what was going on but instinctively I checked the bag, and it also contained the exact contents of my order. 

This was getting a little weird, so I attempted to get the attention of the guys from Wendy’s to tell that I already had grabbed my food.  I wanted to tell them that I didn’t need this second bag they were trying to give me, when a woman came bustling up to the counter screaming that she didn’t get the right food.  

She started rattling off what was in the bag, and I realized she had “my order” too.  My heart was in my throat, and I made what must have been an audible gasp, because upon hearing it, she turned to me, tossed the bag in my face and snapped, “Maybe you want this, I certainly don’t!”  I was frozen in my tracks.  It was all happening so fast and I was so confused, I didn’t know what to do.

My head was spinning, but it was what came next that I have no explanation for.  Through the counter guy’s drive thru radio, I heard a customer order coming through loud and clear.  I was stunned by the specifics of the order.  

The contents of the order were very familiar but it was the voice that hit me.

It was the voice that came through the speaker that had my full attention...  

It was mine.
