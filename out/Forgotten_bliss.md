The day was a new day, dark but lovely, the mountain peaks engulfed in new. daylight, dark yet light, like the two halves of yin and yang. I remember seeing the sun for the first time. The beauty of it, but the danger of observing something so beautiful was magnetizing. The attractiveness of something dangerous has always been enticing to me. What makes it that way?

I was 4; it was bleak. The day felt like night. My eyes hurt at the sign of light. My dad was crying and I had no clue why because my understanding was limited. But my mother died that day.

I was born with a condition called Hyperthymesia. It's a curse that makes me remember
everything since the day I was born. Yeah, it's pretty grueling to remember all the pain.
But really, knowing I have known nothing but pain my entire life is beautiful. Pain is beautiful, like looking at the sun.

My dad hit me and hurt me. I wonder if he felt the bliss I felt, if it was as satisfactory to him as it was to me. 
recently moved into a small apartment its gray, bland but that's fine it doesn't cost much i only have a few dollars and my job doesn't pay well some would think im stoic others would just call me poor but im living in a nice middle ground between the two and besides noone will bat an eye at a poor person in Hoboken New Jersey i like it here it's the perfect place to start my rapture the revelation 

The body is the reciprocal, the perfect channel for my desires. The rain was loud. A blaring silence 
While I was waiting for my first follower, I could hear the drops hitting the wet concrete of the alley drip drip drip while I waited for an hour, then two, then four before I gave up. I walked home in frustration at the fact that no one walked through that blasted alley. No one followed the light to the opportunity I set up. The anger I felt was boiling over. Then she appeared. Beautiful like the morning sun My first follower-she was drenched in water. I pulled my umbrella up and
offered it to her. She kindly accepted and we walked four blocks and turned down an alley. We talked about her husband and how he didn't wish for her to come out this late. The serpent was trying to keep me from liberating her. We stopped in the alley. I made the excuse of my shoe being untied. I then let her feel the bliss. I let her feel the pain.

The next night, I finally slept. Like a new born child,no dreams just a peaceful sleep but I had to wake up. I quickly turned on the news to see if my liberation had spread, to see if my follower had spread the word I turned on the news on my old beaten up TV to see that the police had found her. Her husband looked distraught and confused, but only I could see his devious intentions. The sly look in his eye. Only I could see the devil trying to prevent me from completing my goal.


I went to the coffee house today it was an interesting experience, I ordered a black coffee dark like the night on a new moon i sat and watched as people came in and ordered their drinks I waiched their smiles their poor faces there unwillingness to feel the bliss they all deserve i felt at peace thinking, envisioning me liberating them one by one making them feel the pain they so greatly deserve just like me they can be happy once im done with them. Suddenly my imagination was interrupted by a swift snap in the face by a small feminine hand. it was a young girl about 17 she asked me if im leaving i didn't realize how occupied my mind had become as it had become dark i asked her where everyone had gone she stated it's just you and me i'm about to lock up i got up trying to save time in order to liberate her i looked at her arms she had scars across her wrist she wished
to be liberated she understood the pain i walked towards her and she backed off i tried to talk to her she let out a word before i grabbed her throat i wrapped my hands around her small thin neck and slowly watched the light disappear her struggling was slowed and she went limp she was liberated finally she was free and happy. i lock the door behind me on my way out and went to bed peacefully


It's time, today is the day the end of the road i hold in my hand the tool of liberation. A gun purchased recently i walk out my door it feels cold as a slight winter breeze runs up my neck a shiver down my spine i ask myself the question is today my crucifixion is today the day i die for the sins of my followers the people who force me to do this the people who lie about the pain they wish to feel. i climb up a ladder to a building tall enough for me to be hidden i sit on the edge and peak through the scope like i have the eye of god seeing all my future followers living the lie of life living without the bliss we all seek it reminds me of when i was 11 and was hunting i remember the blood i remember the way the animal smelt as the bliss was flowing through them the warmth of the body in the cold air. I spot a boy through my scope i gently squeeze the trigger like the finger of god and bam i see him grab his chest then i quickly move to my next follower then the next and the next. 

one after another liberating them with metal in there chest i live with this i live with remembering everything with every detail of my life i live with bliss because of the pain i remember the words i told my father as i stabbed him i remember the look in his eyes as he died i told him i love him as a tear left his eye i wanted him to fill the bliss just like me he loved me enough to show me the truth. I heard the voice of a man yell. 
I turned around to see a police officer. I stood up and put my gun down. These are the last words I have to write in my bible. I lived happily... I jump.

Bliss, Pain, and Suffering are the same. we torture those we love to show we love them, pain is the light, its the bliss in the world without knowing. To feel true happiness
you must feel the greatest pain.
