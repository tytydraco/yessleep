My sons, Rick and Kevin, have been missing for three days. We’ve talked to the police, but they aren’t doing enough. We knew where they went hunting, so we went to look for them. We just found Rick’s phone and a video recorded the night they went missing, and I’m transcribing it here as I watch it because I am so desperate. Please, I am begging you to just read it; I have no where else to turn. I just want my sons to come home. 

*Video Recording* 

“My name is Rick. My brother, Kevin, is gone, and I think I’m about to follow. I’m recording this for anyone that might find it. 

God dammit, I’m running out of fucking time. I don’t have any service and my phone battery is low. 

My brother and I bought 35 acres from a very eager seller, with the intent to deer hunt on it. It’s the perfect property for hunting. Mostly open aside from one hill, easy access, locking gate, the whole nine yards. 

The icing on the cake was the lone hilltop. It’s wooded on all sides, with a circular clearing on top approximately 100 yards across. We set up our blind, excited to see what wildlife the property held. We saw several deer, but nothing to write home about. Still, our anticipation was high. 

About an hour before dark, I catch the form of a tall, gaunt figure stepping into the clearing opposite of us. 

I whispered to my brother, “That must be why the owner wanted to sell it so badly - a trespassing neighbor.”

Both of us put our binoculars up to get a better look, and we froze solid. 

It was a man who looked to be in his late 60s, and appeared to be almost 7 feet tall. He had a clean-shaven face and wild, dark and unkempt hair. He was wearing a white button-down shirt, with a tie and suspenders, but the suspenders were razor thin and the tie was far too wide, and his arms and torso were too long for the rest of his body. 

I was so paralyzed by his stature and clothing that I didn’t even notice the most fucked up part at first - he was screaming violently. He was just standing there fucking screaming at us. His arms were dangling limply at his sides, the veins were bulging from his neck and forehead and his eyes were wide with a mixture of pain and terror. 

Dropping my binoculars to look at my brother, I frantically ask, “What the fuck, dude? Who is that? Do we call 911? The guy could be hurt or something.” 

I put my binoculars back up and focus on him. It was then that I realized that not only was he not taking any breaths, *I couldn’t hear his screams.* We couldn’t hear a THING, when we were more than close enough to hear it. 

“What the fuck?”, my brother shouted, “Why can’t we hear him, Rick??” 

My mind racing, I impulsively shout to the man, “Hey! Are you alright??” 

We watch him silently, both of us holding our breath. 

It was at this moment that the man erupted in a full sprint toward us. His stride was long and rigid, while his arms remained dangling at his sides. In the brief moment I still had my binoculars on him, I saw that he didn’t stop screaming. 

Without a word, we both bolted out of our chairs and frantically grasped for the zipper to open the blind door. Once outside, we sprinted in the other direction as hard as we could. 

I looked back only once; the man was closing in, still screaming in fucking silence. 

We entered the woods surrounding the hilltop, our feet crashing down onto the oak leaves that blanketed the ground. 

We had only made it halfway through the wooded area when we began hearing the gaunt man’s long-strided footfalls behind us. 

“WE NEED TO GET TO THE FUCKING TRUCK!”, my brother roared through his gasps for air. 

We were on the final descent before the woods gave way to a more open field. We slid and sprinted our way down the rest of the hill, and the pounding footsteps gained ground with every second. 

Kevin was right next to me. I don’t know how this happened, but I can’t get it out of my head. FUCK, MAN! WHAT THE FUCK? 

We were almost to the edge and all of a sudden, Kevin trips and slams to the ground. I run to a stop and turn around to find that gaunt man dragging my brother back into the woods and then carries him into a fucking TREE. He scaled the tree like he and my brother weighed nothing. 

My brother screamed, telling me to shoot it. I sent all the rounds I had in the rifle, but it didn’t stop this creature, or whatever it is, from violently gnawing and tearing at my little brother. During this, the fucking thing still had the screaming expression on his face. 

Out of ammo, I took one last look at my best friend of 27 fucking years as he was ripped apart 30 feet off the ground. 

I ran from the squelching sounds and made a dash towards my truck. In the last 100 feet, I could hear those same footfalls closing in on me once again. I made it to the truck, got in as quickly as I could and locked the doors. 

Through my own rapid breaths, I could hear the footfalls flying past the truck in every direction. The man was aimlessly running past the truck from random angles, but it was too dark to see. 

This brings us to now, just a few minutes after I realized the keys are probably at the base of the tree my brother was dragged up into. 

*He drove the fucking truck; he has the fucking keys.*

I can still hear him running around my truck. It’s completely dark now, and I used all my ammunition when Kevin was in the tree. I have no other options. If I don’t make it through the night, please tell my family and friends I love them, and for the love of fucking God, don’t buy this la-“

*Recording Ended* 

I am in tears typing this. I can’t stop thinking about my boys being in so much fear, or possibly being taken forever. I don’t know what to do now. 

My husband is on the property looking for any trace of them right now. I have to go look for him, and hopefully I find him before it’s too late. His phone goes straight to voicemail… and it’s getting dark.
