I'm currently in an immense amount of pain as I write this. My leg is stuck in a bear trap, and the trap's teeth are digging into my shin. This is the most intense pain I have ever experienced in my life. I may never be able to use my left leg again, but that's currently the least of my concerns.

I left my apartment around 10 PM. I just moved in here and hadn't yet explored the woods. I'm the type of guy who really enjoys night walks, so I took my flashlight and pocket knife and headed out. Around 45 minutes into my walk, the trail that I was on "theoretically" ended. The reason I say "theoretically" is because there was a "Private Property: Do Not Enter" sign. Who in the world has private property two miles deep into the woods?

I have to be completely honest when I say this: I make risky and stupid decisions sometimes. Growing up, my friends and I would sneak onto all kinds of private property, whether it was old factories, schools, malls, or things of that nature. Seeing as I thought this was just a piece of land deep in the woods, I honestly continued without any hesitation.

I walked for what must have been about 15 more minutes when, all of a sudden, I reached a clearing. The grass was tall and thick, growing up to my waist. It had clearly not been cut in years. As I shone my flashlight around the clearing, I noticed that there was a small path that had been trodden through the grass. When I raised my flashlight to see where the path led, I illuminated a small cabin. The cabin was barely visible since I was about 75 yards away, and my flashlight is pretty weak.

Why in the world would someone build a cabin all the way out here?

At this point, I had two options. I could either walk toward the small cabin to see what was inside, or I would have to turn back. After walking for what was now about an hour, I decided there was no way in hell I would leave without checking out that cabin.

I started walking toward the cabin through the path when, all of a sudden, my phone received an Amber Alert. The high-pitched screech startled me, and I stopped in my tracks. The alert rang out for about three seconds until I was finally able to silence it. Even though the sound had ceased, my heart was racing a mile a minute.

At this point, I was about 15 yards away from the cabin and just standing still when, all of a sudden, a light turned on inside.

My stomach filled with dread.

Who the hell was living in a cabin in the middle of the woods?

After freezing for a couple of seconds, I came to my senses and decided that I needed to get out of there as quickly as possible. I jogged through the tall grass, focused only on getting out of the clearing. I did not want to have an uncomfortable confrontation with whoever I had just woken up in that cabin.

With all the adrenaline running through my body, I must have missed what was on the ground right in front of me. With one big stride, my left leg landed on a metal bear trap. The teeth of the trap clamped down on my leg. I immediately fell to the ground in pain, my left leg stuck in the trap.

I couldn’t comprehend what had just happened to me. I let out a cry but immediately silenced myself. Who the hell puts bear traps around their house?

I’m in an immense amount of pain, lying on the ground with tears in my eyes as I write this on my phone. The lights in the cabin have been turned off again, but I’m scared that I can’t hold back the pain much longer.

Should I ask the person in the cabin for help? But who the hell keeps bear traps around their cabin? As I looked around the ground near me, I noticed at least five other bear traps in close proximity. I must have been incredibly lucky while walking up to the cabin.

If anyone has any advice, please help me. I’m in immense pain, and I don’t know what to do.
