Alright, update time. I tried my best to ignore the knocking coming from the back of the house, but as you can imagine it was incredibly difficult to do so. Focusing on writing out my original post helped a lot, but that relief was short lived. I wanted nothing more than to put in headphones or chuck on some YouTube videos or something to drown out the noise, but weirdly the thought of not being able to hear it started to freak me out more. It’s a good thing I didn’t distract myself though because not long after posting there was a change in the pattern of the knocking. It went from a gentle rapping to a violent pounding. Even at the other end of the house, I could hear the window frame shaking and vibrating, and I was surprised that the glass didn’t shatter based on the viciousness of the knocks. The new pattern sounded off once, then the knocking stopped. It started with the same sequence as last time with a new pattern added to the end. The new pattern went as follows:



*Knock, knock. Knock, knock, knock, knock. Knock, knock, knock, knock. Knock, knock, knock. Knock. Knock, knock, knock, knock. Knock. Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock. Knock. Knock. Knock. Knock, knock, knock, knock.*



It was long and loud, and I was more than freaked out, so some of the pattern may be slightly off, but I’m pretty sure this is it. Again, I have no idea if this is important or relevant, but I don’t want to leave anything out just in case.



The louder knocking proved enough to stir Kiera awake, she was frightened and grabbed my arm so tightly I think I might bruise. I’m not sure if the sound woke them too, but underneath the bed Zelda and Pickles both starting hissing like mad and fighting each other. We couldn’t see the fight, but Zelda came running out from under the bed and jumped up into Kiera’s lap. We looked at her and she has several deep scratches over her, including one over her left eye, as well as quite a few patches where fur’s been ripped out.



Pickles still won’t come out from under the bed, and I can’t get much of a look at him. He’s hiding and anytime I poke my head under he hisses like mad. I really wish I kept the space under the bed less cluttered so I could get a better look at him, right now I can’t see much, and I really hope she isn’t hurt too bad.



 We thought about taking Zelda to the emergency vet, but to be honest going outside kind of scared both of us and we thought it best to wait until the sun came up. At this point that was only a couple hours away. I should note that Zelda looked relatively okay, that’s why we decided on this, if she was seriously just, we obviously would’ve taken her, our safety be damned.



With Kiera awake again I suggested we try leaving the room together, holding hands the entire way. Not much time had passed but I was going stir crazy in that room and wanted answers to what was going on. Also to be honest I needed to piss pretty badly.



She was not into it and grossly said I could go in her empty water bottle if I had to, but she was not letting us leave the bedroom until the sun was up. We argued for a while and eventually she relented; in hindsight I wish she didn’t.



Hand in hand we walked out of the bedroom and down the hall. We both kept stopwatches running on our phones and checked the time constantly, we agreed if there were any strange jumps we’d run back to the bed as quickly as possible.



Our hallway is narrow and walking side by side is awkward, so I was leading from the front with Kiera right behind me. As we reached the end of the hallway and the back window came into sight, I saw the lumpy shadow I had seen early standing at the glass, staring into the house. I froze. I couldn’t make out much detail, but some things I did notice were that the mass seemed to be quite large, close to seven feet at my guess. The body of it was vaguely cone shaped and the head, if it was a head, was large and perfectly round, sort of like a basketball.



I squeezed Kiera’s hand tight. I couldn’t take my eyes off it. “Do you see that?” I asked Kiera through gritted teeth.



No answer.



“Kiera?” I whispered a little louder.



Nothing.



I turned my head to look behind me. As soon as the shadow creature left my vision, I felt Kiera’s touch disappear. I looked back to where she should’ve been and there was nothing but an empty hallway. “Kiera!” I screamed.



Still, nothing.



I snapped my head back to the back window and the shadow was gone. Panic set in. I didn’t go to look for the shadow this time or for signs of intrusion, instead I simply bolted for the bedroom. I pulled up my phone as I went, the time was normal. I opened the stopwatch and watched the seconds tick by: *00:01.57, 00:01.58, 00:01.59, 04:02.00.*



When I stepped back into the bedroom, the curtains were open, and sunlight was streaming in. Kiera was sitting on the edge of the bed beside a pile of scrunched up tissues, her face red and puffy, she’d clearly been crying for some time. Zelda was sleeping beside her, the cut on her nose now stitched up. Strangest of all was seeing Kiera’s father sitting in the corner of the room. He saw me first, “The hell have you been?” He asked, partly concerned and partly angry.



“Just down the hall…”



“Bullshit! I don’t know what the hell’s going on, but it stops now.”



Kiera’s father then went on to half seriously/half jokingly accuse us of being on drugs (I can assure you we are not, we don’t even smoke weed.) It took us about fifteen minutes of attempted explanations before we managed to calm him down and we could actually talk about what happened.  



I asked Kiera if she saw the shadow and she had no idea what I was talking about. “What shadow?” She asked.



“The one at the window, you could see it from the end of the hall.”



“I never got close to the end of the hall…”



My gut dropped. Kiera went on to tell me her side of what happened. Apparently, we only took about three or four steps together before I pulled my hand away from her, she stopped and called my name, assuming something was wrong. I didn’t answer so she took a few steps forward to the light switch and turned the hall light on (hindsight again we should’ve had that on the whole time, but I completely forgot about it.) When the light came on, I was nowhere to be seen. She called for me again and again but heard nothing and so retreated to the bedroom.



Hearing this terrified me! I know for a fact me and Kiera made it to the end of the hall, I was holding her hand the entire time. I’m certain I looked back multiple times during the walk and saw her behind me, but after hearing her side of events I’m starting to doubt myself. Either way I know for a certainty that I was holding her hand right up until I turned away from the shadow.



Once Kiera got back to the bedroom, she called her father again and told him to come over. It was about 45 minutes before he arrived, at that point they searched the house and backyard together. No signs of me and no signs of an intruder. Kiera’s father then cooked up some eggs which Kiera was too distracted to eat. Afterwards he caught sight of Zelda and worried about her decided to take her to the vet himself. He practically begged Kiera to go with him, but she didn’t want to leave the house without me and so she stayed in the room. Her father got Zelda checked and stitched up, then came back to the house, they’ve been sitting and chatting in the bedroom for the past half an hour.



I’m now sitting up in bed writing my account for all of you, still hopeful that someone out there will have some information on what’s happening to me. Kiera brought me a bucket to piss in and emptied it for me when I was done. Her father fried up some more eggs for me too. They both seem to be able to move about the house without issue. Her father has even left the house entirely and come back with no problems. Yet I can’t go more than a couple steps without losing time.



Since making it back to the room this time I haven’t heard anymore knocking. Now that it’s daylight I’m tempted to go check the window again, there’s something about the sunshine that makes me feel like things are different, like it’s safe or something. But I’m also scared to disappear again and what that’ll do to Kiera, she’s taking this hard, and I’m worried what’ll happen to her if I go again.



Please, if there’s anything I’m missing or if someone out there has experienced something similar reach out to me. I need to stop this. I don’t know how much time I’ve got left.
