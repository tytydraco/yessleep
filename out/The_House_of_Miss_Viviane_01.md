When my mom and I moved into the Alto do Prado gated community, I thought my social life was over. Everything there was too white, too clean, too sterile. The houses looked like something out of an architectural catalog: smart glass windows, artificial lawns, residents programmed to smile and wave with robotic politeness.

Except for house 47.

It was... different. A remnant of another era. The façade was matte gray, with tall, narrow windows wrapped in red creeping vines that climbed all the way to the second floor. Ornate iron gates surrounded the garden, twisted into tangled arabesques. And gargoyles. Yes — actual gargoyles perched on the roof edges. A gothic overstatement in a neighborhood of minimalism.

And that’s where Viviane lived.

Tall. Dark eyes. Long, jet-black hair. Her skin had a warm, olive tone that seemed to drink in the light seductively. She was too beautiful. A dangerous kind of beauty. The kind that makes you uncomfortable just by existing.

She had the kind of presence that silences a room. Always dressed to perfection, heels clicking on the pavement, makeup flawless, and a perfume that floated across the street — a mix of violets and something bitter… metallic.

At first, I thought she was just lonely. Rich, exotic, maybe a bit promiscuous.

Almost every night, a different man would arrive at her door. Never before 10 p.m. Always the same type: big, heavyset, meaty men. Some were well-dressed, others looked like they’d stumbled in from a dive bar. But they went in… and never came out.

Not even the ones who drove there. Not even the ones who looked like it was just another casual hookup.

I figured it was coincidence. Maybe they stayed overnight. Maybe it wasn’t my business — until the gardener disappeared.

It was a Tuesday afternoon. I was in my room, pretending to study, when I saw the new gardener walk through her gate. A large man, sunburnt and slow-moving, pushing his tool cart.

Two hours later, the cart was still in the garden.

But him... gone.

I asked the front gate security. They said he’d quit on the spot, no warning, didn’t even collect his last check. His car sat there for two days before it vanished too. And Viviane, the next morning, was watering her plants like nothing had happened. Smiling.

That’s when I started watching her.

At night, with my lights off, I filmed through the window. The routine was always the same: 10 p.m. sharp, she opened the door, greeted them with a slow smile, and they entered in silence. Moments later, a soft red light would glow from the upper floor. Subtle. Pulsing. As if there was deep, slow music behind those curtains.

And then… nothing.

No sound. No exit.

Until the night she saw me.

I was at the window, camera on, when Viviane stepped onto her balcony. She looked *straight* at me. There was no way she could see me in the dark — but she *did*. She smiled. Slowly, from the corner of her mouth. Like she was saying: *“Got you.”*

Two days later, a delivery arrived in my name.

But I hadn’t ordered anything.

Inside the bag, there was only a note:

**“If you want to know, come. Tonight. 3 a.m.”**  
With a lipstick kiss pressed into the corner.

I should’ve ignored it. But I couldn’t. The obsession had sunk in.

At 2:55 a.m., I climbed her back wall with a flashlight and a heart pounding in my throat. The side door was cracked open.

I stepped inside.

The interior was strange. Dark. Lavishly antique. Heavy wooden furniture, thick carpets, paintings of nude women with impossibly large eyes. The house smelled too sweet, cloying — like perfume laced with something coppery.

At the end of the hallway, an old elevator. Wrought iron. The kind with a folding gate and amber-lit buttons.

I went down.

The basement was tiled in white. A narrow corridor stretched ahead, the corners stained with something dark. The air was humid. Dense. At the end, a door stood slightly ajar — and beyond it... hell contained in one room.

Three iron cages. Tall and narrow. Just enough space for a man to stand upright — but so tight they couldn’t move an inch. Inside... the men.

Now I saw what I’d never seen from my window.

They were naked. Each one wearing a metal chastity belt, locked tight, the edges digging into flesh. Their bodies were covered in bruises and scars, fresh and faded alike. Their heads were bound in handmade masks — crude leather stitched into blank faces, burnt symbols carved into the hide. Beneath the masks, they were blindfolded. Gagged. Breathing heavy. Shaking.

In the center of the room stood a stone table.

Black.

On it, a man. The largest yet. Also nude, restrained with thick leather straps. His body bloated, purpling from bruises. But it was his face that froze me.

His eyes had been **sewn shut**.

Thick black thread stabbed through his eyelids, sloppy and crusted with dried blood. And his mouth... forced open by a dental spreader, locking his jaw wide. Saliva drooled down in long strands, pooling on the stone.

He didn’t look alive.

But then I heard it.

**Click. Click. Click.**

Heels.

I turned.

Viviane was descending the stairs.

And something was *wrong*.

Her skin — once a warm olive — was now pale. *White*. Translucent. As if the blood had been drained out. Blue veins crawled across her neck and shoulders. Her eyes were solid black. No whites. No irises. Just endless darkness. Her beauty had become monstrous. Ageless. Ancient.

She smiled.

— "You wanted to know, Clara." Her voice was soft, velvety. "Now you do."

She approached the man on the table, trailing her fingers across his chest. He flinched. A guttural sound pushed from his stretched throat — a muted, helpless groan.

— "Eyes… are useless down here," she whispered. "But the mouth... must stay open. To moan. To invoke. To *give*."

Behind me, the men in the cages began to stir. Faintly. Desperately. But they were trapped. And the metal belts bit deeper with every move.

— "They’re my reserves," Viviane said. "Fat. Fear. Blood. I feed slowly. They last... months."

She opened her arms like presenting a sacred altar.

— "That’s how I stay young. Beautiful. Untouched."

The man on the stone began thrashing. The threads on his eyes stretched. His mouth, forced open, let out a sound I’ll never forget. A soul-tearing whimper of pure panic.

I wanted to run. To scream.

But I couldn’t.

Viviane leaned in close, lips brushing my ear, and whispered:

— "Now that you've seen… there's no turning back."

And smiled.
