I should have known the job was too good to be true. 

But at the time, I didn’t care— nor did I have the luxury to. For months I had been hauling my groaning ’99 Toyota Corolla from one quiet back road to the next—industrial dead-ends, behind shuttered strip malls, anywhere the cops were less likely to knock on my window. I held my breath every time it sputtered, praying it had enough life left for *just* *one* more night out of sight.

On that unnervingly quiet night— that damned night— I jolted awake in a cold sweat, heart already hammering in my chest. 

I had been expecting the sound: three violent knocks against the window, each one rocking the car like a threat. The panic hit fast, but it wasn’t unfamiliar. Lately, fear had been arriving like clockwork, just another part of the night. 

Usually, those threatening knocks were followed by the blinding beam of a cop’s flashlight. The story was always the same—some jogger reporting a suspicious car in a forgotten corner of town, or a worker spotting a car that didn’t belong on their way to an early shift. Whatever the story was, it always ended with: “I don’t care where you sleep, but you can’t sleep here”—spoken with a hint of annoyance, and sometimes even a flicker of disgust. 

But that night, the lights didn’t follow.

Was the weight of my homelessness finally breaking through? Had my anxieties grown so loud that I’d started imagining sounds? 

No—I’d definitely felt the car shake, and each vibration that accompanied those unwelcoming knocks. 

My eyes darted through the darkness, frantic and exhausted, desperate to find what had stolen the little sleep I’d managed to claw together. Lately, sleep felt more like a gamble than a guarantee. Now that the cold was creeping in, even the night felt hostile. 

Unsatisfied by the silence, my fingers found their way to the familiar key into the ignition—the oval plastic head cracked down the middle, the metal blade dulled and notched from generations of wear. 

The engine sputtered as always, each cough striking a pang of fear into my heart, before finally catching life. 

Whatever was out there, I wasn’t waiting to find out.

It wasn’t until the headlights blinked on in protest—flickering like they too, resented its rude awakening—that I noticed. 

My windshield wipers weren’t where I’d left them when I’d drifted off in the cold. They stood upright, like some unseen Samaritan had tried to prepare my worn-down car for an approaching snowfall. 

And there, tucked beneath one of the blades, was a small black rectangular business card—curled at the edges, shifting in the breeze as if it was waiting to be noticed. I leaned forward, squinting through the glass. 

That hadn’t been there when I fell asleep.

I cautiously glanced into the mirrors one last time before hesitantly stepping out of the car. 

I’d chosen this spot for its emptiness—quiet, tucked away, and easy to miss. But in places like this, there were often others lingering, just as desperate as I was. I had empathy, sure—but not enough to risk losing the little things I owned. 

The cold met me first, sharp against my skin, slipping through the threadbare sleeves of my jacket. The sound of gravel crunching under my shoes hit my ear as I crept around to the front of the car. 

The card twitched against the windshield, the rough breeze tugging at its corners like it was trying to pull away before I had a chance to snatch it into my grasp. 

Placing the wipers back to its place, I freed the card from their grip. With the unidentified card in hand, I scurried back to the driver’s seat and slammed the door shut—the creaking groan of metal echoing into the silence. 

The card bore a playful question, engraved with a smile that felt like a slap in the middle of my shitstorm:

*Want* *a* *do-over?* ;) 

What a disgusting joke to play on a man struggling to survive. 

Whoever had made the card clearly had money to burn—enough to waste on someone else’s misery for amusement. 
It was thick—three times the thickness of a normal business card, and coated in sleek, high-gloss lamination. Hell, it was even scented. 

The subtle scent of lilacs filled the car, a jarring contrast to the usual mix of stale air and sweat that clung to everything inside, the result of going weeks without a proper shower.  

I had half a mind to throw the card out my window—I reached for the manual crank, which took a few stiff turns and a minor arm workout as I turned the card over in my hand. 

Just as the glass hit halfway, I froze. There, on the back of the card, was *my* *name*.

**Silas** **Thorne,** **28**
**Male,** **Homeless**

Despite my earlier sweep for signs of life, I frantically squirmed in my seat, twisting to check every window and every mirror, desperate to catch a glimpse of whoever had left the card. 

I never stayed in one place for too long. But they knew me—and exactly where to find me. 

I’d never rolled up my window so fast in the six years I’d driven this thing. My hand slipped a couple of times on the crank, slamming into the seat adjuster jutting awkwardly from the side of the seat. When the window finally rolled shut, that familiar pang of fear struck my heart—hard enough to make me forget the throbbing pain in my hands.

Thump.

Oh SHIT. oh shitfuckpissfuckshit— 

Thump.

THUMP.

I was frozen. Every instinct in my body screamed at me to get the FUCK out of there, but my limbs wouldn’t obey.

The sound was coming from beneath the car. Whatever it was, it was directly below me. 

The realization hit. That was what had woken me up. 

I had stepped out there. I had walked right past it—with that *thing* inches away from my feet. 

Goosebumps rose across my skin. There wasn’t more than six inches between the Corolla and the gravel. 

No one could crawl under there—at least, not without a jack. 
Not without me noticing. 

The silence that followed the thumps was thick and suffocating—broken only by the sound of my own shaking breathing. I kept as quiet as I could, as if the thing didn’t already know exactly where I was. 

Abruptly snapping me out of my frozen trance, the old radio in my car crackled to life—sound as clear as ever. That thing hadn’t worked in years, but its sudden return wasn’t a comfort. Not in this kind of silence. 

*“-seconds from jumping when EverKind showed me a new life.* 

*Now I get to fall asleep warm, with a full stomach, every single night”.* 

*[Chime sound. A warm, confident voice cuts in.]*

*”At EverKind, we believe everyone deserves a second chance—no* *matter how far they’ve fallen.* 

*We see you… [static] Silas. We **choose** you. EverKind: Restoring* *dignity, one hire at a time.”*

*Another soft chime. Then, Silence.* 

I sat in a terrifying disbelief, trying to make sense of what I’d just heard. 

My fingers found the dial, turning it slowly—desperate for another sound, any sound, to drown out the fact that something was still beneath me.
 
As if answering my unspoken prayers, the same chime rang out again—soft, melodic, but muffled. Coming from the center console. 

A thousand thoughts slithered through my mind, each one more twisted than the last. Cutting my terror with a stolen breath, I tore open the latch— the thin, rusted line between me and whatever was waiting in the dark. 

What greeted me was an explosion of the scent of lilacs—sweet, cloying, invasive. It forced its way through my nose, and down my throat, like it knew what was best for me. 

And there it was: a phone. Sleek. Slim. Shiny. The kind my old friends used to brag about—lined up outside stores for hours, just to hold the newest model in their hands. I bet not one of them ever felt the thrill that I did, gripping that gleaming thing like it had been meant for me. 

It continued to ring. Soft, insistent, and unrelenting. As though it wouldn’t stop until I gave in. 
And gave in, I did.  

*“Hello, [static] Silas. We’re so glad you’re here. *

*You were born February 29th, 1996.* 

*You hate thunderstorms. You sleep on your left side. You haven’t* *spoken to your mother in five years.* 

*That’s okay. She already forgave you.*  

*We see you, Silas. Your history, and all the pain that came with it.* 

*We’re here to offer you a do-over.* 

*No more cold nights. No more unheard tears.* 

*We have a proposition for you: work with us.* 

*Help us change lives—starting with yours.* 

*There’s a heated bed waiting. Hot meals. A warm shower. All ready for* *you.*

*Do you accept?.”*

My voice betrayed me—rasping out before my mind could catch up.

**“Yes”.** 

The phone went dead.

Not a click, not a tone—just nothing. The screen went black, but the lilac scent bloomed stronger, thick and sweet like rot masked by perfume. 

Then, the pain hit. 

It started in my palm, where I was still gripping onto the phone. It was a sharp burn, like someone pressing a brand into my skin. I tried to drop the phone, to chuck it as far as I could, but my fingers wouldn’t listen. 
They clenched tighter, knuckles white, nails digging into the plastic. 

The screen blinked back to life, with a single word in white letters on a red background:

**”PROCESSING.”**


And then, the car started to *melt.*

Not in flames. Not like metal meeting fire. It *drooped*. Sagged. The steering wheel bent inward as if it was being swallowed by the dash. The ceiling dripped onto my scalp in long, sticky strands, sliding down my face, coating over my eyes.

My mouth cracked open in a guttural scream, torn straight from the gut. 

That was the mistake.

The moment my mouth opened, the car collapsed. 
All at once. A tidal release. 
Its residue funneled inward—whirlpooling straight down my throat. 
It filled my nose. My lungs. It burned with inch it claimed inside me, even as my scream clawed for a proper ending.  

But it wasn’t the asphyxiation that knocked me out. 

I stayed awake—kept conscious by the thing inside me. It kept my heart racing, my brain alight just enough to let me feel everything. Long enough to let me beg for air I’d never get.

No, it was the *falling*. 

They say when one jumps from high enough—high enough to mean it—it’s not the ground that kills them, but the shock. The mind, unable to process the velocity, gives out first. 

That thought had visited me often in places no one looks twice. Maybe falling would be the closest I’d get to peace.

And strangely, I was right.

As my consciousness started drifting, Euphoria met me.

It didn’t crash into me, it *caressed* me. Gently. It soothed every tight knot in my chest, and every breath I’d ever held for too long. 
The weight I’d carried—years upon years of it, began to dissolve. And the casing I’d fought so hard to escape? It melted into me. Became me. 

Like it had always belonged there. 

The smell of lilacs greeted me as I awoke. 

Not the invasive, cloying scent that had filled my car. 

No—this was clean. Controlled. Manufactured. 

I opened my eyes to blinding light. 
Everything glowed: chrome and glass, smooth edges, soft tones. Not a single imperfection in sight. 

And then came the voice from the radio.

*“Welcome to EverKind, Silas. Please report to the dining room  for your first assignment”.*

On the dining table sat a buffet of every food I’d ever wanted: The popping candy my mother never let me have as a child. The Thanksgiving turkeys I’d missed out on year after year. Cakes I used to stare at through bakery windows, pretending they were mine to blow out on my birthdays. 

Perched beside the spread, on a pristine white plate, was a familiar business card. 

**Thaddeus Black, 32**
**Addict. Bankrupt.**
**April 4th, 2024**

Silas frowned. His own card hadn’t had a date. He scanned the room for clues. On the far wall, a digital clock blinked steadily.

*April 1st, 2024.*

Three days early.

The assignment wasn’t to witness Thaddeus’s end—It was to *cause* it.
 
The voice returned—colder now, clinical, stripped of its warmth:

*”Thaddeus Black. Wife beater. Cheater of life. Unworthy.* 
*Your assignment: deliver him to his designated end.* 
*Happiness is a privilege, Silas. And balance must be restored.”*

He glanced back at the plate. Just beneath it, just barely visible through the pristine white linen, was handwriting in soft, looping cursive—*his mother’s.*

A breeze passed through the room—fabricated or not, it carried the faintest trace of lilacs. 

Not the EverKind kind. *Hers.* 

It was how I knew, before I even read the words beneath the plate.

*”Do better than I did, baby. You have a second chance”.*
