Babysitting on Halloween night was not my first choice. I was seventeen and, unlike my brother Tyler, actually had friends. They had all received invitations to the Brookers’ Halloween party, a privilege that didn’t come easy. The Brooker twins were now easily the most popular boy and girl in the whole school, and used their notoriety for, in my opinion, evil. I called out the Brooker sister for her clear bullying a few weeks ago, but should've kept my mouth shut. I was left without a friend to spend Halloween with, so decided to take my neighbours up on their babysitting offer. They lived in a slightly bigger house than mine just down the street. We weren't exactly next door, but they were close with my parents and knew me since I was an infant. They trusted me, and wouldn't have thought of calling anyone else when they were invited to a dinner party for the 31st. When I confirmed that I could, they were thrilled. They had a daughter, Tilly, who was an only-child. Tilly was your average six year old, racked with hyperactivity and a deep, unwavering obsession with horses. Every evening I spent with her, I learnt something new. 

I guess she wasn't the worst company, and I was sure that I'd have a better time with her than my supposed friends who'd hang me out to dry like that. I walked over to their house at around six in the evening, just as the trick or treaters began to infest the streets. I pushed past crowds of young kids dressed as anything from fairy princesses to horror movie killers. Before long, I arrived at the front door of Matilda's family home. I knocked and waited patiently amongst a group of children draining a bowl of candy marked “please take one” that lay on the porch railing. The door opened and they scattered, leaving the empty plastic bowl spinning in their wake. 

“Lisa!” Matilda's father proclaimed, “Thank you so much for this. Please, come inside.” 

I shrugged past him as he attempted to tie his tie with his free hand. Their home was lovely. Rich mahogany floors framed tastefully decorated walls with the slight clutter of toys hinting at a child's presence. It was a picture postcard of suburban paradise. 

“Tilly! Lisa's here!” Her father yelled as he fixed his tie in the mirror. 

There was commotion on the second floor and within seconds, Tilly was sprinting down the stairs. She leapt at me and wrapped me in one of her famous hugs, which only reached up to my waist. I ruffled her hair and knelt down. 

“Are you ready to have some fun tonight?” I asked with a grin. 

The little girl nodded vigorously. 

“Yeah!” She exclaimed, and then “I made a scary mask at school. Come and see it!”

She tugged my hand and I told her to bring it down to me. She nodded again and ran back up the stairs on all fours, focused on her mission. As soon as she had disappeared, her father spoke again. 

“Listen, Tilly has been in one of her moods lately. She told us that she saw a monster last week and has been a bit… jumpy since then.” He said and paused. “I'm talking bed wetting.”

I nodded with concerned understanding. 

“I know it's Halloween, and she'll want to watch a Halloweeny movie, but try to keep the scares to a minimum. You got that?” He asked as he undid his tie. 

“Understood,” I replied, “there go my plans of watching Casper with her.” 

He chuckled as we heard the downstairs toilet flush. Soon, the door swung open and his wife emerged. She glided elegantly towards us wearing a beautiful red dress. Her hair was done up neatly and she wore a pearl necklace. She smiled and greeted me before going to her husband to tie his tie properly. Before we could have a conversation in full, Tilly came rushing down the stairs. Her parents explained they were in a rush and left, telling me they'd be back before one. I stood at the door and waved them off with their daughter.

Tilly's mask was painted in purple and red before being doused in glitter. She tried to cut horns into the top of the cardboard mask, but thanks to the safety scissors, they only came out as nubs. Still, she loved it, and I feigned  terror when she put it on and roared at me. 

“That's amazing!” I told her.

“Is it the best one you've ever seen?” Tilly asked. 

“It is!” I said, laughing. 

After that, I sat down with her and asked her what she wanted to do while we watched cartoons. Between bouts of laughter brought on by spongebob and his friends, she explained to me that she wanted to carve a pumpkin, “like the neighbour's” she added. 
As she sat, I went into the kitchen and found a freshly purchased pumpkin laying on the marble top counter. After setting everything up, I called Tilly in for the main event. I couldn't find anything she could safely use to cut it with, so I put on some Halloween music as she scraped out the guts and seeds, then gave her a marker to draw the face. Once she was happy with her zany design, I carved it out. When it was finished, I popped a tea light inside and watched her face light up with joy as her creation came to life. Before I could pick it up and put it where Tilly had planned, the doorbell rang. 

“Where does your mother keep the Halloween candy?” I asked her. 

She pointed to the cupboard behind me and I fished out a large bag filled with smaller bags of gummies. I tore it open as I walked to the front door. Just before I reached it, the impatient trick or treaters rang it again. Swinging it open, I was greeted by a group of kids. One was dressed as Beetlejuice, another in a homemade robot costume. There was an especially tired looking boy carrying a toddler dressed as a pumpkin, his younger brother I assumed. They presented their half-full bags and buckets to me expectantly. I dropped some candy into each of them, and as soon as the last was full, they ran off to hold the next house to ransom. 

Suddenly, I heard a crash followed by a young scream. I slammed the door shut and ran to the kitchen, finding Tilly standing amongst a pile of smashed pumpkin chunks, crying. As I cleaned up, she explained to me between tears that she had attempted to pick the pumpkin up but it slipped from her hands. Once the pumpkin gunk had been disposed of, I guided the still sobbing little girl into the living room.

“What would make you feel better?” I asked as we sat on the sofa together. 

She sniffed. 

“A Halloween movie?” She suggested. 

I frowned, and mulled her question over. As I did, the door rang again. I told Tilly to have a look through her DVD collection as I answered the door. A solitary trick or treater stood in front of me, wearing a shoddy, homemade costume that I guessed was supposed to be Leatherface. I dropped some candy into his bucket and filled up the bowl on the porch as he ran off. Before I went back inside, I stared out into the night. Small packs of kids were dotted here and there, although this street had been mostly swept through. The sky was dark and the air was still. A gentle wind carried crisp leaves, sending the specks of orange and brown flying. Somewhere, a dog yelped. From next door, I could hear the faint sounds of terror emanating from a cheap horror movie. I stood and wondered if my friends were enjoying themselves at the Brooker's party. I frowned again and went inside. 

Tilly leapt in front of me, clutching a DVD of Ghostbusters. I smiled and took it from her, and went to kneel by the DVD player when a faint memory struck me. Wasn't there a sex scene in Ghostbusters? I couldn't remember exactly, but thought it was best not to risk it. I had Tilly guide me to her DVD collection and together we picked out something more appropriate - Halloweentown 2: Kalabar's Revenge. I slotted it in and pressed play, and sat down on the couch with Tilly. In about half an hour, she was asleep. I laughed to myself when I noticed and shook her awake, altering her that it was time for bed. Wearily, but reluctantly, she let me half drag her upstairs to the bathroom. She stood at the sink on her tippy toes, trying to see her own reflection. I brushed her teeth and got her ready for bed. Once she was tucked in, I read her a story and said my final goodnight. I turned her bedside lamp off, leaving a nightlight on to comfort her. I was halfway out the door when she spoke again. 

“Lisa?” She asked in a quiet voice. 

“Yeah?,” I said, turning back to her, “what is it?”

“Could you check my room for the monster?” She asked in earnest. 

I chuckled to myself. 

“Of course sweetie,” I said. 

I walked over to her beside and knelt down, making a point of looking thoroughly under it. 

“Nope, no monster here!” I said enthusiastically as I stood back up. 

“Could you check my closet?” Tilly pleaded, “that's where it was last time.”

I smiled at her. She was clearly frightened, and had covered all but her eyes with the duvet. I can remember thinking then that maybe Halloweentown had been too much. 

“Of course I will,” I said and walked over to the closet. 

I gave a little countdown and swung the doors open. There was nothing inside, as I'd expected. Just some of Tilly's clothes and a few toys. Other than that, it was barren. Before I closed the closet's doors, I crouched down and picked up something that'd caught my eye. I had thought it was a button, but it turned out to just be a piece of dirt. I flicked it from my fingers and stood, closing the door. I made my way back to Tilly and filled her in on what I found. 

“Your room is a monster free-zone, well done!” I said jovially, trying to lighten the mood. 

Tilly nodded rapidly in response and then sank under her bedsheets without so much as a goodnight. Job done, I turned and left the bedroom. I went downstairs and flopped onto the couch. I lay there for a bit deciding what to do. Just after I decided to have a rummage through the cupboards for some good food, I heard the doorbell ring again. I sighed and got up. It was late for trick or treaters, but not unheard of. I made my way to the dark green front door and opened it. Standing in front of me was a kid in a white sheet, clearly meant to be a ghost, although no effort had been made to even so much as cut eyeholes out. 

“And what are you supposed to be?” I asked jokingly. 

No response. I realised I had nothing to give the trick or treater and saw that the bowl of candy had once again been demoted to just a bowl.

“Wait right here, I'll get something for you,” I instructed them.

I swivelled around and walked down the short hall to the kitchen. I grabbed the first loose piece of candy I saw and retraced my steps. I opened the front door again and was met with the same white-sheet wearing trick or treater. I smiled, not really knowing how well they could see me through the linen, and dropped the candy into their plastic, pumpkin shaped bucket. That's when I noticed it. Their hands. Their hands were clearly that of an old man, wrinkled, liver-spotted and bony with bulging veins. My smile faltered as a chill crept down my spine. Slowly, and without looking up from the man's hands, I stepped backwards and inside, closing the door and locking it behind me. I did think about calling the cops then and there, but what would I have told them? That I saw someone who was too old for trick or treating? It sounded stupid, so I just made my way back into the living room and sat down. I took out my phone and checked my messages. I had none. My mind once again lingered on the image of my friends living it up while I was on my own in this dark house. 

After some time of self-pity later, my attention returned to my hunger and I got up to look through the kitchen's cupboards again. Their kitchen was really nice, plenty of marble and oak. Every appliance was shining, and seemed to be top of the line. The food in the fridge, unfortunately, didn't seem to reflect the same rich taste present in the rest of the kitchen. After a while of searching, I took out a plate, a loaf of crust bread and a block of cheese. I buttered the bread and took a long knife from the rack to thinly slice the cheese. As I cut, I heard something. At first, I thought it sounded like shoes squeaking on a tilled floor. Then, as I listened closer, I managed to make out where it was coming from. I took a step back from the island and looked through the kitchen door, down the small hall and to the entrance. The front door handle was moving up and down as someone tried it from the other side. 

“Hello?” I shouted, which trailed off into a whisper as I remembered the sleeping child upstairs. 

Cautiously, I approached the front door. I felt on edge, but didn't let my mind jump to conclusions. I was halfway down the short hall when the movement stopped. I reached it, and peered through one of the two slightly frosted thin windows that were set into the wall either side of the door. There was no one there, at least not that I could see. In an attempt to rationalize, my mind decided that it might've been one of Tilly's parents having arrived home early. Had they really said they'd be back at one or was I misremembering? I decided to check my texts with them to see if I was in the wrong, or if there'd been a change of plan. As someone who's locked themselves out of their house countless times, the idea that they forgot their keys wasn't too outlandish. I realised I'd left my phone on the couch in the living room and turned back to get it. That's when I saw it. 

Have you ever looked at something, but your brain didn't register what it was? Maybe it took a while of just standing and staring for it to properly process. That's what I felt in that moment. That was the sensation that took hold of me as my eyes fixated on… it. From the front door, I could see all the way down the short hall into the kitchen and out the kitchen window. Behind that was the pitch blackness of the backyard, and something else. The moment I finally understood what I was looking at, the upper half of the old man's face, bald and pale, that had been peeping in just above the window sill, dipped back down. I screamed for the first time that night, but not the last. After a moment of paralysing fear, it dawned on me that the back door was unlocked. 

I rushed into the living room and grabbed my phone. Hands shaking, I quickly dialed 911 and crouched down between the sofa and the door, trying to make myself as small as possible.

“Hello? Hello?” I said in a broken, hushed voice. 

“911, what's your emergency?” replied the muffled voice from the other side of the line. 

“There's… a man. I think he's trying to break in,” I managed to stutter out. 

“Okay, stay on the line with me. You said there’s a man trying to break in, can you tell me where you are right now? What’s your address?” the responder asked without emotion. 

I told them my address and there was a pause. 

“Got it. I’ve sent officers to your location, they’re on their way right now.” The call operator assured me. 

They spoke again but I didn't hear it. I lowered my phone and tried to listen out for a repeat of the noise. I thought I heard. Was he trying to get in? As scared as I was, I knew I had to try and lock the backdoor before he could. Slowly, I emerged from my hiding place and crawled cautiously across the carpet. I got to my feet and peered into the kitchen. There was no one in sight. I took a tentative step forward onto the linoleum tiles. As soon as I was certain that old man was hiding anywhere, I rushed forward into the utility room that was tacked onto the kitchen. Inside the cramped room was a washing machine, a shoe rack and the back door. I grabbed the keys left on one of the cupboards and hurriedly locked it. I let out a deep breath that I had held until my lungs burned and made my way back into the kitchen. As I did, I lifted my phone to my ear once again. The operator was frantically asking if I was still there. I assured them I was ok, and still needed help to be sent out. Once that was made clear, I hung up to ring Tilly's mother. It rang for a while, but she eventually picked up. 

“Lisa darling, is everything ok?” She asked, sounding quite tipsy. 

“No,” I choked out, “there's a…” 

I trailed off as I stared at the kitchen island where I'd been preparing my food. The knife was gone. He was in the house.

“Lisa? Oh God Lisa, what is it? What's wrong?” Tilly's mother pleaded with me to answer. 

Before I could, I heard a scream from upstairs. As my fear was replaced with panic for Tilly's safety, I began to run towards the stairs. As I scaled them, I heard the little girl scream out again. 

“The monster! The monster!” she yelled, then silence. 

I tripped on the last step and tumbled onto the second floor. I quickly got to my feet and staggered towards Tilly's room. I could hear sirens off in the distance, inbound for my location. The voice on the other end of my phone was screaming now too. I burst into Tilly's room and was met with the worst sight I could've imagined. Nothing. Her bed was empty, the sheets thrown back. Her nightlight still whirred, spinning horse shaped shadows across the room. I stepped inside and looked around. She was gone. I got to my knees and looked under the bed, then in the closet, but she was nowhere to be found. I stood and stared at her window, which was open wide with curtains caught fluttering in the wind. I slowly raised the phone again. 

“I'm sorry,” I [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/s4zrX1QbyQ).
