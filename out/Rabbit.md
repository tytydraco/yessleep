I remember my rabbit.

At first it was like any other rabbit. Like any other child’s stuffed toy. Soft with the texture of an old blanket, colored a calming teal with lilac spots. Two beady, yet caring eyes and small, triangle noise that curled into a smiling mouth.

I liked my rabbit. Who didn’t like my rabbit? Every show and tell I’d bring it. Children would gawk, they’d stare, they’d be in awe. They’d “ooo” and “ahh” and “ohh” at my rabbit, every time. Sometimes, I’d smuggle it to school anyway, on days where I wasn’t meant to. It’d be confiscated and I would be interrogated by teachers. 

I never liked being in trouble.

I was a stereotypical “good” kid. Did my homework. Ate my vegetables. Brushed my teeth and washed behind my ears. 

After my mother brought my rabbit home, from somewhere she never said, I changed a bit. I was still “good”, of course, but not much so. I would rebel, whine, and bicker. I would be in trouble.

My rabbit wanted me to. It told me it was fun. It told me being “good” all the time would get boring. Its voice was a whisper in my head, yet it felt as if it was right in my ear. Maybe I imagined it.

After our school bully, Jimmy, took my rabbit from me one day, that was when something strange began to occur.

I dreamed about my rabbit.

They were not pleasant dreams. Nightmares, in fact. Ones I’d wake up in tears, screaming at the top of my lungs, I’d run to my parents’ room and tell them I had a scary dream.

My dreams always had my rabbit in them. 

My rabbit looked different.

Its eyes were humanoid, and they bulged from sudden sockets. Its smile was wide with too many teeth.

My rabbit would tell me something. It would tell me it was going to do something while I slept, while I thought it was still tucked in my arms.

It would usually tell me it would fight the monsters under my bed and lurking in my closet until the morning. Sometimes it was mischief. It would chat with the raccoons, visit the owl for tea, sing with the mourning doves.

It would be then I’d wake up, screaming at the top of my lungs.

The night Jimmy took my rabbit, my dream was different.

My rabbit was angry.

My rabbit told me that it would get back at Jimmy for taking it away from me. All I had to do was bring it to school for show and tell tomorrow.

I obeyed my rabbit, curious as to what it would do.

Jimmy took my rabbit away again at recess, jeering for me to come and chase him to get it back.

And as I chased, Jimmy made the mistake of running out into the street.

A bright blue car blurred into his way.

The children who watched gasped. Someone screamed. 

And then, chaos.

I remember seeing Jimmy lying in front of the car in a puddle of red, his face frozen in surprise and shock. He lay so still, so eerily still. 

I remember seeing the person in the car get out and call 911. I remember the blaring of sirens, hauling Jimmy into an ambulance and driving off. I remember everyone screaming and crying, mostly hysterically, while others stood in shock.

I was one of them.

I was too busy staring at my rabbit, still in Jimmy’s still, grasped hands, missing an eye, an ear, and a mouth.

I told my parents that my rabbit made the car crash into Jimmy. 

I didn’t like my rabbit anymore. In a way, I was afraid of my rabbit. 

My father had had enough of my whining about my rabbit. 

He took my rabbit, went somewhere out of town, and “got rid of it”. He never said how or where, just somewhere out of town, and that I didn’t have to be scared or worry about my rabbit anymore now that it was gone.

I would later find out that he had “gotten rid of it” by burying it in the woods.

Today, I asked my Dad where he “got rid of” my rabbit.

I drove and dug it back up.

My rabbit hadn’t changed. It still was missing an eye, an ear, and a mouth, and was, unsurprisingly, covered in dirt.

I took my rabbit home and washed it. 

My rabbit was here again.

It felt strange for me to hold my rabbit after so long.

The rabbit that had killed Jimmy.

I tried sleeping with my rabbit again.

The dreams returned.

In them, my rabbit was broken.

One of the bulging eyes hung loose from the socket. The missing ear had fleshy entrails spilling out, and its missing mouth had ripped open to reveal the mouth of a skull. Its chest was ripped open and housed two tiny lungs and a beat, pulsating heart.

My rabbit, my broken rabbit, kept asking me something. A simple question:

“Why?”

Every night.

“Why?”

Every dream. 

“Why?”
The familiar voice would come back in my head every time I looked at it in my waking world. In a rasping voice.

“Why?”

Last night, I asked it something in return.

“Why?” It asked again.

“‘Why’ what?” I demanded.

“Why?” It said again. “Why did you leave me?”

“Because of what you did,” I answered, tearing in my eyes. “Because of what you did to Jimmy.”

“I only tried to help,” It said. “I only wanted to play with you.”

My rabbit killed to protect me?

I refuse to believe that, there has to be another reason. 

I’m too afraid to find out, though. Too afraid to ask.

My rabbit might hurt someone again. Someone who, like Jimmy, caused me anguish.

I don’t want that to happen. Not to anyone.

I remember my rabbit. My rabbit remembers me. My rabbit never forgets, never forgot me.

My rabbit is broken.
