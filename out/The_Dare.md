You know you shouldn’t have gone to this party. They probably only invited you out of
pity, or maybe as a joke. But you still went. Mom was working all night and you really didn’t
want to watch your kid brother. This seemed like a good enough excuse. It’s not like you knew
this would happen. You didn’t know you would be out here, all alone, in the cold, cold, night.
You didn’t know it would be your last.

The girls and guys are on the front lawn of the house, lined up on the porch. The peanut
gallery to your final show. They watch you, giggling like sadistic maniacs. Why did you take
the dare? You always take the truth, always.

Now you’re walking across the street, flashlight in hand, straight ahead, down the hill, to the creepy creek where the sewer runs out. The water will probably be low due to the dry fall the
town has gotten. There’s an old legend about this sewer. It supposedly is home to an ancient monster. Nobody really believes that though. Not since we were kids. It’s likely just some homeless guy trying to stay warm during the harsh winters. Still everyone stays back at the house. Not daring to go anywhere near where the monster may lurk

As you near the edge of the hill you hesitate for a minute. Looking down it seems to go on forever. A mysterious pit full of fear and old wives-tales. You are pulled out of your spiraling when some drunk kid from the porch shouts and throws his beer bottle, yelling at you to stop being so scared. Before you can even process how hypocritical that was you are faced with a shattering blow to the back of your head.

It sends you rolling. You try to keep your feet under you but you’re tumbling head over heels down the hill. The dead grass scratches at your bare skin like sandpaper. Limbs flailing all around like a pinwheel.

After what seems like eons, you reach the bottom of the hill. Landing in the half-dried mud of the creek. How did you get here? Propping yourself up with your burning arms you are almost knocked down from the pain. Your head is pounding and hot. You touch the back of your
skull where the pain seems to be the worst. When you pull your hand back you can see the glimmering red blood in the metallic moonlight.

You look to your left and see the opening to the sewer. You were down here for a reason, maybe this is it. 4 Large bars run vertically across the entrance. There are large enough gaps between the bars that you can squeeze your body through with ease. Nobody seems to be coming back for you and the hill is too daunting for your frail body to climb now. Everybody is probably already back inside, moved onto something else long ago.

You continue forward. The flashlight is still in your hand. You switch it on and enter the sewer. It is quite wide and tall when you initially walk in. A considerable amount of space between the sides of the wall and yourself. Not claustrophobic by any means. It is damp and dark but the flashlight illuminates the long tunnel well.

A quiet scurrying sound arises from the wall to your left. You quickly shine your flashlight onto it. It is a long, metallic, centipede. It crawls into a crack in the wall, disappearing from sight.

Your flashlight flickers for a second, then turns off completely. Leaving you alone in the darkness. Shit.

Suddenly your vision lights up. Your eyes couldn’t have possibly adjusted to the darkness this well, and quickly, for that matter. The light is coming from the end of the tunnel. The light shines brighter and brighter.

The light seems to be getting eaten by some great figure. Like the moon covering the sun. It is getting closer. Louder. Like dropping a million jacks on concrete. You feel your legs move. One after the other. Over and over. You see the end of the tunnel. But the walls are narrowing. You have to crouch, then crawl. The huge figure is gaining on you. It gets even louder, like chittering. You don’t remember the walls being so close. Maybe it was just your mind playing tricks on you. The sewer gate is only a couple yards ahead. You are dragging yourself by your arms at this point. Your fingers digging into the ground.

Once you finally reach the gate you realize something is terribly, terribly wrong. The 4
vertical bars that were previously easy to fit through are now 12 thick metal poles. A mouse
could barely fit through the gaps. The figure is just feet behind you now. You can contort only
your hand through the bars. You hear the bones in your fingers cracking. The figure envelops
you. Cold. Wet. Loud as a monsoon. Finally, darkness.
