My mother always said I had a demon in me. 

It came to life when I learned how to play dice with the older boys down by the river. I was drawn to the chance, you see? A roll of the dice was all that stood between nothing and something greater. A born gambler, but a cursed and learned loser.

I’ve lost for most of my life, but now all I do is win. At least at the table. 

It started in New Orleans in 1962.

It was midnight and I was sitting in Jackson Square, nursing a busted head and a near empty flask of Jack Daniels. I’d just lost more than I had in a game over at The Roosevelt, and been throttled over my empty pockets. I ambled down toward the river where all my troubles began, so as to drink myself stupid.

I was staring at the church, ready to finally give up my wicked ways when a light cut through the fog.

A little store over on the corner of Chartres was still open, and a small still voice called me like a siren through its squeaky door.

It was a bizarre little place full of voodoo and odd things, and buried in all that junk, I saw a little totem of a smiling man carved out of wood and polished to a high shine. A tiny cork stuck out the top of its head. 

The scrawny old man behind the counter told me that it was a lucky charm. A magic object whose origin dated back to when ambivalent gods watched over the beginnings of man. Inside the statue was some sort of magic juice. He said that whoever drank that little bit of potion inside would have luck like no other on this earth, said that once it was inside a man, there was no getting it out.

I asked him how it was that it came to be in his possession and he told me that it was a family heirloom. He smiled real big at that one. 

He was asking fifty dollars, and there I was with not two nickels to rub together. I had to have the thing. I was simply bewitched by it.

There was something about that old man that troubled me; it was as if he knew that I had every intention of stealing that little charm out of his store, but he didn’t care. It felt like he wanted me to steal it. Who was I to disappoint him?

I acted as if I was looking at his other wares, and when that little bald wrinkled bastard turned his back, I snatched that little statue and ducked out the door into that hot night.

I pulled the cork and sipped at the foul swill inside before I finally shot it all down the back of my throat.

I took a year at the tables in Vegas. I couldn’t lose. Within two weeks I was richer than most, and by the end of the year, I would never want for anything again.

One would think that always winning would get tiresome, that going through the motions when the outcome is already decided would become rote. 

One would be wrong. After almost 45 years of being a loser,winning never got old.

I decided to take myself to the world poker game. Money was good and fine, but I figured, why not add a little fame as a cherry on top?

By the end of the game, I sat acrost from Harlan Wade, the world’s best for the last two years. For two nights, we battled, and then the last hand was about to be laid down.

Wade was a haggard man, as if all that winning had taken his sleep and sanity as payment. I’ve got to admit he smelled a touch rotten as well. Simply put, the man was a reeking mess at the table.

When he made that final call and I put down my cards, I found the look of happiness on his face a little puzzling. I’d just tied the long hairs on his head to the short hairs on his ass and kicked him out of his title, but he simply sat back in peaceful resignation and reflection while everyone’s attention turned towards me.

I’d finally had my brush with fame. World Champion. I’d like to say I had my way with a celebratory bottle or two afterward, but the truth is, I felt sick as soon as I turned my cards over.

I retired to my room and barely made it to porcelain before I started heaving my guts. 

I spent two more weeks in Vegas, and day after day got worse. My thoughts and dreams were of things I dare not speak out loud and my body was weak. I kept winning, but something on the inside was losing. My insides were always on fire, like something was eating me from the inside out.

I went to the doctor, but all he could tell me was that I was healthy as a horse. I just needed more sleep.

My last day there, I saw Harlan Wade at the bar. He looked to be a totally different man. His skin looked better, his hair not so greasy, his eyes not so drawn.

I ambled over and meant to strike up some conversation, but as soon as he saw me, his face dropped. He couldn’t look me in the eye.

No sooner had I got my drink, he picked up and walked away without a word. I stared at myself in the mirror at the back of the bar for a spell. I was on quite the decline; still winning, but looking ten pounds of shit in a five pound paper bag.

Two drinks in, Harlan Wade came back, and what he said would change my life forever.

“I gave you something when I lost. Someone else gave it to me first. It's a demon.”

I laughed in his face to look the part of the tough guy, but on the inside, my heart sank.

“It gnawed at me and ruined my life for three years. The only way to get rid of it is to pass it onto someone else by losing. But it’s gotta be an honest loss. I lost on purpose a few times, but it didn’t work. Trust me, get to gambling as fast as you can and pray to God that you’ll lose soon. You don’t want to know how bad it can get. I’m so sorry.”

He walked away and I just stared at myself in that mirror. Somewhere inside my guts, I knew that thing was laughing at me. It had found a permanent home.

All these years later, a ruined suffering shadow of the man I used to be, I pray for death. All my attempts of taking it on my own have failed.

How long can this misery go on?
