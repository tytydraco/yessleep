This was about 4 years ago in Newark New Jersey. Me and my friend Lothar were into clubbing and we wanted to find some new spots around to spend our nights at. Lothar told us about one spot called the Pass, a spot for raves and punk music. It sounded a lot better than the usual Newark clubs we were going to. I hated the “music” (if you could call it that) those thugs in the clubs were playing. 

“thank goodness it wouldn’t play any of that hip hop cr*p” he said to us on the way over. Lothar really hates hip hop, unless it’s Eminem or Tom McDonald, so he was always finding the best underground scenes for blood rock and emo music. Nobody really knows where Lothar came from. He just showed up one day at my college as a transfer student from this country I’ve never heard from called Finland. Apparently he used to be pretty hardcore, and was part of a Finnish gang! Pretty rad stuff if i do say so myself. 

Anyways, our Uber driver picked us up this one fateful night, and was bewildered at the place we were getting dropped off at “i wonder why I’m taking you kids to an abandoned factory? Hell I thought this place burned down 20 years ago” he said muttering. He smelled like Pink Whitney. Only pussies drink Pink Whitney so I paid him no attention. Lothar was quiet, just staring off at the Highway we were taking. 

We got to the Pass and the driver was right. It was an abandoned factory, there was no club, or so I thought… 

We walked in and there was a rave going on. Except it wasn’t any regular rave. It was a sausage fest. All of these blonde guys were there and there were no chicks to be seen. “Lothar” I yelled angrily, “you took me to a sausage fest what’s wrong with you?” Lothar shrugged and told me I would have fun. Thirty minutes passed and it dawned on me that all of these people looked strangely like Lothar, but a little off. One of them had realistic looking blood all over his leather coat. The music stopped and Lothar grabbed the mic. “Tee hee I tricked you” he said pointing at me while another person was doing the Fortnite L dance on stage. “This is no club we’re going to invade the smelly saxons and pillage their women tee hee” and he talked like a bad impression of a German person. I knew something was up and I was shocked. This wasn’t the Lothar I knew… 

Myself being a smelly Saxon I wasn’t going to let this happen, but I also was too afraid to do anything so I ran away. I looked back at the Pass and the factory was gone. All that was there was a viking ship on the river, and a bunch of Vikings on it! I called an Uber and waited 20 minutes on the curb for my ride as Lothar continued to jeer me and did the Fortnite L dance at me. “Tee hee I cannot wait to see all of the gold those smelly Saxons have waiting for me. Me and my Viking gang are going to reconquer the British Isles.” I sat on the curb while all this was happening. Man I thought to myself, this is pretty hardcore of him. My Uber came and it was the same pussy as before drinking Pink Whitney, only this time he was driving a Kia Soul!!!! Lothar at the sight of the Kia Soul let out a blood curdling scream. “NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO” he screamed as the high-beams from the car melted him and his crew into goop. I went home and never saw Lothar again. Safe to say, it was a spooky experience for sure.
