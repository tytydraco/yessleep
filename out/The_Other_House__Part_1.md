I'm not an awfully regretful person. I've made mistakes, ones I wish I could take back, but overall, I don't think I'm the kind of person to wallow in my own misdeeds. That being said, there's one regret I've carried for years now. That regret is spending my senior year of high school, my last year before full on adulthood, not having fun, not making friends, and not creating good memories, but rather engaged in a psychological battle with an enemy I could hardly comprehend. And to make it clear, I spent most of that time on the losing side.



I'm aware as of writing this that my account will be titled The Other House. It rings well. It's a little eerie, a little attention grabbing. And most importantly, it resonates to my very spine and grips me so tightly I cannot and will not lose even a detail of what occurred all those years back. But it'd be unfair to blatantly tell you what I've titled my account without explaining first why. 



Frankly, there was another house behind my own.



I still don't know where it came from, because my earliest memories of my home completely deny its existence. But over twenty years later, I can still remember its sudden appearance and the subsequent hold it had on me. 



I'll paint a picture. Well, I'll try. My house, the one I spent my first 18 years of life in, was one which stood at a stout two stories tall on the corner of a street which could fluctuate between quiet suburban dream and run-down crackhead territory depending on the season. Behind my house and the others was a hill that appeared monstrous to my younger self. It was shrouded in trees, dead vines, and other indistinguishable plant life I couldn't and probably won't ever be able to name. No one was ever ambitious enough to take up the task of clearing that hill. It spent a long time there and I wouldn't be opposed to calling that hill king of the neighborhood, the way it loomed over our every day and night.



I won't quite submit to the cliche and claim I spent my entire childhood up there, but I certainly ventured up there often with my friends in elementary school. There wasn't much we could do up there besides pretend we were jungle explorers. There was never enough flat ground for us to make anything, and any effort it would take to flatten the ground was meaningless. We could do whatever we planned to do in someone else's backyard, where the ground was flat and the grass was greener. 



One specific time comes to mind. Probably my best memory up there. I'd been playing with Bucky, a kid who'd moved to town recently and as far as I could tell didn't have any other friends. The two of us and a group of a few other kids had been traversing the hill again, hoping that something awesome had miraculously appeared within. After about an hour, everyone had given up. Except Bucky and I. The two of us braved the prickers and leaves slimy with morning dew. As the sun came all the way up, red and orange illuminating our surroundings, we came to a strip of flat land and stared into the distance. Beyond the hill had been a valley of pink plants, lively and bright under the rising sun. The smell was out of this world. At the time they smelled like blackberries, slightly acidic but sweet. Even the rotting power lines stretching across the valley couldn't take away from the awe of the scene. I'd like to say we stayed there for an hour but it was probably about five minutes before we headed home. That was the best of the hill. As for the worst . . . 



In eighth grade, I'd been practicing archery in my backyard. That Christmas, my parents had gotten me a bow, arrows, and a giant target. Every shot, I'd imagine myself in some kind of interview years down the road, explaining how I'd just picked up archery for fun. I hadn't meant to develop skills honed enough to save the planet, but it had just happened. I would also imagine Margaret Miller, the girl I'd liked, swooning all over me as I shot off arrow after arrow, ripping down rows of zombies. I guess I got lost in these thoughts, because I got way too deep into the shots. I let go of the string and an arrow launched out, soaring forward and making a ripping noise as it slammed into the back of another arrow already on the target. It vaulted itself off and up the hill. 



I sighed, putting aside my fantasy, put the bow down on the driveway, praying my father wouldn't run it over if he came home. I shoved my hands in my pockets and strutted over to the hill. The winter plants were dry and crumbled, shoved aside by my hands as I began to climb. No bright orange. Where the hell was that arrow? 



I began to paw at the ground to support my climb up the consistently steeper hill. No orange. I should've just let it be. One arrow out of at least twenty. No loss. But I didn't think that way at the time. Hunched over, I clawed my way up through the branches and dirt until I saw the bright orange strip that signaled the rest of the arrow attached. 



I scampered up to it and snatched it up from the dirt. There was no time to relish in my victory, though. Something else caught my eye. Standing maybe 8 yards off, on flat ground I hadn't seen before, was a house.



It was two stories, and clearly abandoned. Its gray paint chipped off beside broken windows. The door stood ajar, cold and obscured daylight illuminating the stale air within. Behind broken windows were sealed shutters or dusty curtains. The front steps were old stone, cracked and untrustworthy. This gray, empty box that stood only about forty yards from my backyard towered above me, yet it did not grimace. Even then I sensed nothing but emptiness within. Yet something told me, screamed in my head: WRONG.



I rushed down the hill, sliding through the dirt. My grip on the arrow never loosened, and had it been alive, it would've choked to death. Finally, I rolled into the backyard. Sure enough, my mom chewed me out for dirtying up my clothes so badly and for going up on the hill. She said it was covered in poison ivy and I could get sick. 



Odd, I had thought. I didn't see any poison ivy up there. That was just about the only plant I could identify. I didn't see it at all.



In the end, I never brought up the house that had appeared behind ours up on the hill. From our house, it wasn't visible behind the trees. Completely obscured, and I was happy with that. Plus, if I'd blabbed about it, I'd surely get in trouble or something. I could get someone else in trouble. 



Most importantly, I had bigger concerns. My dad had, in fact, crushed my bow when he pulled into the driveway.



2002  


In the four years since I'd first seen the house, I hadn't forgotten at all. Out of sight, out of mind was a pretty good motto to live by when it came to the other house up the hill, but occasionally something about it scratched at the back of my head and made the little hairs all over stand up. But bigger issues exist, and I was in my final year of high school.



On an early fall day in October, Bucky and I were out on the town, enjoying the last year of real freedom we'd have until retirement. He pulled his car into the parking lot of our local grocery store, Food Plus. He stepped out of the car, long and lanky, the crisp wind blowing back his long, coppery hair. Now that I think of it, everything about Bucky was long. He was like a stick figure. He flashed his trademark dumbass crooked tooth grin at me as I got out of the car, stretching my arms behind my back and slamming the door shut because doing that got on his nerves. He ignored it and continued our conversation from the car.



“Homecoming dance is in a week, man. You sure you're not coming? I can lend you the money for a ticket.”



“It's not that. I got the money. What I don't have is a date.”



He held a chuckle. “Yeah, cause you haven't stopped jerking off to Margaret long enough to talk to her.”



I went to punch his shoulder, but he swung himself out of the way. 



“You know I'm right. Not about the beating your shit part, but the not talking part. Just ask her, man. Come on.”



I sighed. Maybe too dramatically. “It's not that easy.”



“It's quite literally that easy. If she says no, just play it off like a dare.”



“That's a prick move.”



“It is. But you're the one who's obsessed with not getting embarrassed. You're going to.” He pointed a long finger in my direction.



“I'll ask her for prom. How about that?”



“That's months away. If you just do it now, you'll get it over with.”



“And if she rejects me, that's the rest of the year I have to deal with.”



“Compared to the end of the year where you get to date for a month and then probably move apart for college.”



I shrugged and stepped forward quickly to grab the door to Food Plus and held it as I entered. Bucky followed. 



“I'll make it even easier. If you man up and ask her to homecoming, I'll buy you pizza.” He smiled again and I couldn't help but grin back.



“You were doing that anyway.”



“Think about it. Hero!” 



Spider-Man had just come out toward the end of junior year and the both of us were borderline obsessed. He did the Green Goblin voice well, so I couldn't fault him for interjecting quotes whenever he could. 



I tried to stay out with Bucky as long as I could, because I didn't want to show my parents my first progress report, which contained two D’s and a C. Eventually, Bucky had to go home, so he dropped me off and gave me the finger as he began to pull out.



“I didn't wanna say it but if you don't ask her out you're a pussy!” 



I waved back to him, hoping my parents hadn't heard that as he drove off. They didn't.



We had dinner, I lied about how I didn't get my progress report, watched a little TV, and pretended to do my homework. Tomorrow, I'd go to school, dance around asking out Margaret, not do it, go to work, come home after screwing around with Bucky for a while, eat dinner again, watch TV again, and pretend to do homework again. It was a microcosm but it was my microcosm. 



But I wouldn't be writing this if my life stayed that way all year.



As I was dumping a half completed statistics packet into my backpack and rubbing my eyes, something in my window caught my eye. In the dark I couldn't see it well, only a shape and a few colors, really, but it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what I was looking at. Slightly above the tree line and visible from where I sat was the other house, resting on the hill and looking over my home from its spot among the trees and vines. I had that pang in the chest when something terrifying happens but you suddenly realize you're fine. Issue was, things weren't fine. The pain left as soon as it arrived, but I was left with a sickly feeling inside. It had never been visible from our house. Why now? The trees looked the same. Nothing had changed. So why could I see it now when I never could before? 



Had it moved? 



I stared at it for probably ten minutes until I got the feeling that something was staring back. I sat back in my chair and pulled the blinds down. Sweat had pooled just about everywhere on me and I realized my hand was shaking. No, it wasn't that bad. I wouldn't let it be that bad. It was a shitty abandoned house that had finally just become visible because the trees were losing their leaves. It had to be.



But it wasn't.



When I encountered the house for the first time, I felt nothing. I'm not some paranormal sleuth or an empath or anything, but I've got enough sense to tell when something is wrong. I knew the house was wrong when I first saw it. But I didn't feel anything . . . malevolent?



That wasn't the case anymore. It was in my chest, the feeling. Both warm and cold, prickly and smooth, inviting and yet I could nearly feel the slamming of shutters. The house was wrong and it felt wrong. It wasn't empty anymore. Something inside, too, was wrong. 



How, though? The house wasn't big at all. It couldn't be holding a werewolf or something like that, and if it was, I'd have known.  



Then again, I hadn't actually been up there since I first saw it. 



I peered through the blinds and looked at the house, partially hoping it was gone now. Nope. Still there. The night wasn't exactly windy, but I could see leaves dancing in the air. So why the hell was the house so stagnant? Nothing moved an inch. Not the shutters, not the curtains. I couldn't see the door that had stood ajar four years ago, but I could guarantee it wasn't moving by a hair.



Something primal ran down my spine and shook my body. I bounced away from the window and sat down in my bed. I reached over and turned my desk lamp off.



*Wouldn't want it to know I was in here.*



What? What was I thinking? It was a house. A couple walls, doors, and windows. Nothing wrong. It didn't move. The trees are dying, and that happens every year.



*Never seen the house through the dead trees before.*



No. No. I must've, I just forgot about it. It was a house. Some construction workers built it out here years ago and it got buried by the overgrowth, forgotten by time because it was a piece of shit house no one wanted to live in. It wasn't worth the space it was taking up in my mind. 



I made myself happy with that conclusion. Done arguing with myself, I sprawled out on my bed, ready to sleep. 



Sleep didn't come for another hour. I wonder if the house slept, too.
