So around 11:30 tonight my boyfriend and I were leaving his house, we pet his dogs as usually and said good bye. This is important just to note that all his dogs were accounted for. Mack was inside, we said goodbye to baby, sandy and little bit, we saw all of them. So my bf lives on a private road, so basically everyone knows everyone, and his parents have been there for 10 years and no new people have came (just thought it was important to add considering I’m not sure what we saw) so if there’s a new animal around, it’s noticed pretty quickly, as people talk and literally the moment a stray comes up they talk about it. As we were pulling out we saw eyes glowing about 50ft away, my boyfriend thought it was a bunny or some sort of animal or something like that (not to mention all the dogs were looking in that direction so general curiosity) so he pulled around so his headlights would shine on it. This thing didn’t look normal. It was too big to be a cat, too small to be a deer, too small to be a pig, but with that being said if it were any of those things it would’ve ran away from the light, like most animals you don’t own do. So at first it went into the wooded area, but then it turned around it like started inching towards us slowly, but would sit down after every step it took. 

Its shoulders didn’t look in the right place, to me it looked like it was walking on its back legs (but my bf says he saw it on all fours so I’m not sure if it was both) This happened about 4 times before we drove off, due to fear.  the way it moved wasn’t natural. It had glowing yellow eyes, black slick coat, the coat was almost shiny and it almost looked like it was contorted or walking strange. It almost resembled a dog but it wasn’t, I’m not sure I still can’t explain what we saw 

anyways fast forward probably a detail I should’ve put at the beginning but the whole reason we went to his house was because he’s was spending the night at mine and forgot clothes. So when we left my house I left the gate open. The important thing to note here is that I live with my grandparents who are disabled, this is important because my driveway is about 150 yards long if not longer. At the time we left and left the gate open my grandparents would be asleep and wouldn’t have shut the gate, I know this because I’ve done this before and usually try to make sure the gate is shut before they wake up in the morning. But yeah the gate was shut and my bf and I were already quite shaken from what we saw so we literally turned around and I’m now writing this in a parking lot. If you have any ideas please let me know, we just want to know if it’s something we need to look out for or if it can be chopped up to something else 

Also feel free to ask questions If you feel there is more information needed

Thanks 

Also thought I should add, all of the cats in the area are orange and white, the only dark colored cat is Molly and she stays inside 24/7 and again it was way too big to be a cat
