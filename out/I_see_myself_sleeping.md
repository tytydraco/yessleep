I'm writing this post to air out things from my past and hopefully move on.

I don't dream I don't know what dreams look like and never heard of them until in class one day our teacher wanted us to document are dreams in a journal, we were learning about archetypes in history and how archetypes in dreams can tell us something about ourselves and our mental state.

Me being shy I didn't raise my hand to say I didn't experience dreams or remember any if I ever dreamt at all. What I didn't know is that I had Aphantasia and only found out years later, Aphantasia means I can't picture anything in my head like you, when they say play with your imagination I didn't know how to and I think that's why the other kids didn't like to play with me because I couldn't see the world they see.

I decided to make up my fake dreams in the journal she gave us, I figured I'm probably not going to be the only one lying or exaggerating a dream they had and besides I have to read it Infront of my class about what I dreamt and think what it means to them.

The fake dream I would write needs to be very boring and mediocre but at least a bit strange for it to be believable. That's how I thought dreams worked and I apologize if you're someone slamming your head on the keyboard saying 
"Not like my dreams!!!"
I'm a very boring person literally no spark inside my head

Like I said I can't really imagine a story so I would take a scene from a movie and write it like it was my own

The movie I decided to steal from was a campy cheap horror film that my older brother collected before he gone to film school was

There's a vampire in my stomach 

The plot of the film is about a girl who has a eating disorder wants to get thinner so she buys a parasite online like a tape worm to help her get skinnier than she already was. Instead she got a vampire inside her that's constantly hungry she eats her dog and niece to satisfy the monster but it's won't become full and it slowly eats her from the inside out.

The scene I chose was when she was sleeping thinking that her parasite was coming in tomorrow she opens her eyes and sees a tall figure dressed in black floating above.

Too terrified to even scream she layed frozen the vampire slowly entered her mouth like a looney tunes cartoon and made her his home.

That scene sticks with me I don't know why but it never leaves, even though I can't imagine it I can feel it.

Before heading to my desk to write my lie, 
I was making faces in the mirror and talking to myself like I was a different person and we started exchanging words to eachother 
I did this ever since my brother moved to go to College besides him I have no friends, it's how I cope 
I say "hi"
The mirror me says hi back
And then we start insulting eachother just for fun just saying racial slurs 
Things a 8 year old will find funny
The mirror me then says something I hush tone not matching it's lips as if it whispered 

"I want to wear your skin"

And I laugh thinking it probably my parents playing a trick on me but quickly realize 
my parents are at work 

You could say I imagined it but we both know that's not true.

I played it off like I said it, I head of to the desk in my parents room to write my fake dream and just writing the scene that happened in the movie but like a whisper in my head giving me an idea like I came up with it I thought it was pretty clever and unique but I regret ever writing it down, I changed the scene slightly like it's the same scene but a little different enough to make it look like I was not coping.
instead I wrote I was in my bed looking up at my mirror self looking down at me and it slowly crawls in my mouth just like the scene in the movie

Words in permanent ink are powerful writing this fabel was signing my soul away

I never dreamed but I lived a nightmare there on
