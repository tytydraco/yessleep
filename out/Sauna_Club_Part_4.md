Sorry for the delay. Time’s become one of the many things in my life that I can no longer keep a firm handle on. 
  
It’s been what? Maybe a fortnight since that first [Sauna Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13lnhu2/sauna_club_part_one/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 
  
A week after that was the whirlwind of events that changed my life beyond recognition. 
  
The day that [Andy went missing](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13mlx1n/sauna_club_part_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) & the night in which I came so close…so damn close to [saving Jen’s life](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13nn16j/sauna_club_part_3/).
  

  
All I wanted to do was lose a bit of weight…and now I have. I’ve nearly shed everything in my life that was weighing me down.
  
After today you won’t be hearing from me again. 
  
I’m truly sorry. 
  

  
The morning after Jen died I woke up in a state of shock. Standing up I had to peel myself from the bedsheets. My back was a mess of burst blisters and pustulated skin. The rest of my body was pink all over except my feet. They were black…The soles looked like dried lava, charred to a crisp but with dark red veins cutting through. And for how hideously burned I looked I was freezing. My teeth wouldn’t stop chattering.
  
“Look at you” I’d wheezed at my reflection. Even my voice was wrecked. That world had stolen everything from me. But it didn’t matter. I’d get it back. 
  

  
I called my wife and told her that I’d just tested positive for Covid.
  
“You sound terrible Mike” She’d said with a sigh, but she didn’t really care. 
  
“I feel terrible. Maybe you should stay away a few days until I’m in the clear?”
  
“You sure?” feigning sympathy…her trademark. 
  
“Yeah…I’ll be fine. Call you when I’m on the mend.” I hung up then. The first time in my life I’d ever cut her off. I didn’t really care what she had to say any more. My heart beat for someone else now. Only Lydia and I understood the truth of this world, and that strange world beyond. I’d made her a promise. I was going to finish my sauna and together we’d go back.
  

  
I spent the rest of that day googling, watching youtube videos and chatting with strangers on reddit about how to put the finishing touches to my sauna.
  
The next day I left my house for the hardware store. 
  
I hadn’t realised how much people would stare…gasp even when they saw the ruins of my skin. At least I was finally losing weight though. Nothing fit any more. The steam in that world was washing me away. I didn’t care. Soon I’d have Lydia by my side and then what would anyone else’s judgement matter. 
  
Finishing the sauna took the best part of a week. I’ve never been a practical guy. In that week I heard more from Lydia than my wife. She checked in daily to see how I was getting on and when we’d be ready to return to that world of fire and fate. 
  
I insulated the small wooden shed as best I could so that it would contain the heat and smoke, built a small fire bin to contain the coals, bought a bucket for the water, 2 small benches and a sand timer for the wall. I roughly laydown paving and put in a grate for drainage. 
  
It wasn’t much to look at, but it would do the job. For days I soaked the wood until the whole thing was saturated enough not to go up in flames with us inside the moment I sparked the coals.
  
And then last night I text Lydia to say we were good to go. 
  

  
An hour or so later she arrived. For a moment she stood on the doorstep staring at me and I had no idea what she was thinking. It wasn’t the same face of shock and disgust that everyone else gave me now but…something else…Something that makes more sense now. 
  
She was changed too. 
  
She had been so bloodied the last time we left the Sauna. Bleeding from a hundred scratches all over. She had healed but the scars were everywhere. She was no longer the perfect blond gym girl I’d met two weeks ago…she was better…she was mine. 
  
I knew that it was cheating the first time I laid eyes on her, the first time she’d touched my leg. What difference would it make if we fucked in my marital bed? So we did. 
  
As we lay there afterwards I traced my fingers along the scars on her perfect body and wished that it was her I’d married…her that was pregnant…carrying MY baby. 
  
It was then we heard the car pull up on the driveway. My wife was home. 
  
“I’ll meet you out there” I said calmly. Lydia nodded and left the bedroom making her way towards my sauna. I wanted my wife to catch her in the kitchen…to see her naked body and KNOW that both of us could fuck up this marriage if we wanted to. 
  
But Lydia managed to slip out of the house just as my wife arrived. 
  
“Mike?” she whispered tentatively in the kitchen “Whose car is that?”
  
“I’ve got a friend round. We’re trying out the sauna.”
  
“What? You don’t have-” she flicked the kitchen light on and gasped as she caught sight of my face. 
  
“WHAT THE FUCK?” She screamed. The state of my burnt swollen face bringing tears to her eyes, whatever love she still had left for me draining away. That was fine. Whatever love I had for her had died on the backseat of my car. 
  
I looked at her swollen bump and knew we were finished. 
  
“I’ll tell you tomorrow. I’m busy now” I said coldly and I could see my words rattled her. She didn’t recognise me any more. I hardly recognised myself. 
  
“What happened?“ she kept repeating and I just shrugged. 
  
“Go to bed.” For the first time in my life she actually listened to me. She slipped away into the dark of our room and closed the bedroom door. Too scared and disgusted to be around me any longer. 
  
I took off my robe and followed Lydia out into the garden. If she was worried about the state of my DIY sauna she didn’t say anything. She didn’t say anything at all. We both knew why we were here and what had to happen next. 
  
Spin the sand timer. 
  
A ladle for each of us. 
  
And then the smoke engulfed us. I was surprised at how well this small hotbox shed was working. In the back of my mind I thought that maybe the magic wouldn’t follow us here. That maybe I’d missed a step or that maybe the whole thing would just go up in flames. 
  
But it worked. 
  
I was alone travelling through that thin film of white heat that separated our world from the sauna place. Perhaps that was the nature of the ritual: That it has worked for so many people throughout the centuries if you have the fire in you and believe. 
  
As I waited for the smoke to clear I tried to hold in my mind why I was coming to this dangerous world once more. 
  
For Lydia – to find out what kept her coming back here again and again and what it was that was tearing apart her body. 
  
For Andy – to find out what had happened to him and why he now seemed to belong to this place. 
  
For myself – To steal something, anything…some divine knowledge from this place as vengeance for Jen. And get away with it.
  

  
The smoke cleared and I knew we’d arrived. It was different though, in all the ways I thought it would be. Just like the Sauna in the gym had become a warped reflection of itself, so had my DIY shed. The only difference was the door to the outside world. There was no poolside view, no horrible visions of those watchers and their nets, just the sound of a ruined world rushing by and screams. So many screams. Through them all I could hear the voice of Jen. 
  
‘HELP…PLEASE HELP MIKE. THEY’RE HURTING ME.’ Her old voice cried endlessly. This place had already tricked me once though...so I turned my back to the door. 
  

  
Lydia was already several steps up and about to leave. 
  
“Lydia wait” I wanted to stop her so we could come up with a plan for how we would manage this visit “I want to help you.”
  
Lydia gave me a weird smile that I couldn’t read and with a shrug she disappeared into one of the corridors.
  
“Wait!” I called again and followed her up a few steps not knowing why she would just leave like that…
  
I could feel again how different this place was. The gym steps had been hot but still had a smooth varnish finish. These steps were rough and splintered. I starred into the corridor and gulped. Remembering what had happened last time I faced this gauntlet alone. There was no sign of Lydia and the corridor was dark but I set off anyway. I’d found Jen, I could find Lydia. 
  
The tunnel twisted and turned, with more tributaries than last time, more maze like. Stairs leading up and down, passages to crawl through or clamber over, tight spaces to squeeze into and long painful drops. 
  
The passage forked and forked and forked and at each junction I had to guess at the right direction but in truth I was lost and all the while the steams grew thicker around me, until it was like I was wading through them. 
  
Then I heard the sound. 
  
A sort of rhythmic creaking and groaning and a woman gasping. I realised that it was coming from the passage parallel to me. Like how Andy had helped me before…
  
The sound grew louder and then multiplied. Another groan coming from below me…and then another to the right. 
  
I pushed my face the slats and tried to peer through to see the cause of the noise but in my heart I already knew. I knew that groan and that voice…and I’m man enough to know the tell-tale sound of creaky springs and a rickety bedframe. 
  
It was my wife. 
  
And when I peered through the gap I could see myself and her wrapped up in each others arms. Some how on the other side of this wall was my bedroom at university and I was seeing into the past. I was seeing the first time the two of us had sex. It was drunk and fumbling but even then I’d known she was special. 
  
I moved to the other side of the room and through the slats saw a different past. Our honeymoon suit and the sex we’d had there. 
  
I pulled away, confused why the mists were showing me this… things I already knew to be true. Below my feet I could hear more sounds, more groans more pleasure…but less familiar to me. Sounds of enjoyment that I’d never made my wife elicit. I ducked down into the swirling mists that had gathered around my waist and crawled on my belly across the wooden floor. I pressed my eye down to the slat, dangerously close to the splinters and peered until I could see the shapes writhing. 
  
My wife and…
  
My brother. The two of them pounding away in my bedroom. In my bed. 
  
I wrenched away, unable to watch it, gasping…and as I gasped I felt hot white tendrils of smoke crawl down my throat.
  
There were so many new sounds to hear…all across the floor before me…more pockets of sound and I couldn’t help myself. I crawled on, listening at each new noise and then seeking out the shape of the next man who would make me a cuckold. 
  
My wife and her boss.
  
My wife and a man I’d never seen before. 
  
Another stranger
  
And another. 
  
Each time I gasped…each time sucked in more white heat.
  
I stood up gasping for air. If these visions were true…how many other men had my wife slept with? I’d known in my heart for a while that the child she was carrying wasn’t mine but…I thought always thought that in this place I might find out who the father was and have satisfaction in that…have revenge with that knowledge but…
  
Did she even know? In her nights out in the town, night after night she made a joke of me. A joke of our vows. 
  
Did she even care who the father was, so long as it wasn’t me! How little satisfaction did I give her that she would fuck ANYONE. 
  
I wretched and thin coil of steam coiled out of my mouth and into the world. 
  
How long had I been here? Breathing in these mists. 
  
This place was getting inside me. 
  
Clouding my judgement.
  
This room had broken my heart and given me no satisfaction…Only more doubt, more betrayal, more confusion…more resolve to find Lydia. To save Lydia and start my future anew with her. 
  
I pushed on blindly down tunnel after tunnel, hell bent on finding her before the time ran out. 
  
“MIKE!” Lydia’s voice screaming, loud, hurt and close by. 
  
“Keep calling Lydia…I’m coming. I’ll find you” 
  
She did “Mike, Mike, Mike” as rhythmic as the groans of my cheating wife. Finally I turned a corner and found her. 
  
Lydia lay with her back against the wall of a terracotta chamber. The sight of room not made of wood took me aback. 
  
I ran to her. 
  
Deep gashes covered her body, like something had sliced deep into her arms and legs and across her stomach. I couldn’t bear to look but I knew that the gauges were dangerously deep. Lydia was bleeding more than a human body could take. 
  
“What happened!” My eyes tried to take in the room quickly looking for the source of the danger, seeking out an attacker in the darkness. My brain remembering what Lydia had said the first time we’d come here. “Every maze has its minotaurs.”
  
“My brother Mike…I came here to get him back.” Lydia spoke slowly, her words slurred and woozy.
  
“Where is he?” I cradled her, not knowing which gash to try to stem.
  
“Dead…he died so young…my piece of shit dad…” the thoughts tumbled out of her mouth erratically “But I can get him back…I just need to…feed the flames…”. Lydia raised an arm to point at a large black pit in the middle of the room. 
  
I’d ignored it at first, taking it for just another one of the sauna’s coal pits, but this one seemed different. Set into the stone work of the floor and surrounded by a selection of craftman’s tools: pliers, hammers, blades, tongs, scalpels, ancient looking drills. Rudimental but efficient and delicately laid out on a piece of linen.
  
This was a Smiths room, and in the centre was the furnace. The coals inside blazed but they weren’t black…they were a crimson red, and they throbbed like organs…and they seemed to be swimming in a small pool of-
  
I heard a crack and then I felt the pain that belonged to it and collapsed to the floor. 
  
I looked down and saw that my knee was no longer where it should be. 
  
Lydia had a mallet in her hand that I’d some how missed before and with a violent twist she had stroke me across the leg. Now she was trying to push herself to standing above me. 
  
“But I can’t give the fire all the ingredients it needs…not alone…I’ve been feeding it blood…every time…but…I can’t give it my bones…my skin…my eyes…I can’t give it that and still be there to love him…to love him in all the ways that SOME ONE SHOULD HAVE” Lydia screamed and the words echoed down the corridor. 
  
Her body shook with the exertion and every time her muscles clenched a fresh squirt of blood oozed from her wounds. There was a mad glint in her eyes
  
I understood now. 
  
I understood why someone as beautiful as her had been showing an interest in a fat idiot like me. She’d just been fattening me up for the slaughter. 
  
She didn’t love me. Just like my wife…I was just another useful stooge to her. 
  
For a moment I lay there, waiting for the mallet to come down on my head…I thought about just rolling over and letting the fire pit have me. At least in death I could be useful to someone. At least Lydia would get her brother back… 
  
Then a fury rolled across me, a rage I never knew I had inside. Like all the mists I’d swallowed were bubbling up inside me and I decided then that I didn’t want to die. 
  
Not yet.
  
“Fuck you.” I grabbed the nearest implement to me and flung it at Lydias head as hard as I could. The pliers caught her in the temple with a hard crack and I watched her teeter backwards towards the furnace. She caught her balance on the very edge and as she wobbled I saw a long dribble of blood cascade from the cuts in her arms and into the fire pit. The cloud of red mist exploded into the room curls of crimson smoke snaked their way upwards like tentacles. 
  
Standing was harder than I’d anticipated with my knee on the wrong side of my leg, but I had no choice. Not if I wanted to live. Leaning hard against the wall I stumbled away as quickly as I could. Back out into the corridors and away through the maze, with no mind on getting back just getting away! 
  
I paused when I reached the first crossroads. Breathing hard and checking behind me to see if Lydia was following but there was no sign of her. 
  
I leaned against a wall trying to catch my breath and wondered if there was a way I could set my knee. 
  
The blade entered my back and I don’t know how deep it travelled before I realised what was happening. I peeled myself off the skewer and turned around. Through the slats in the wall I could make out Lydia on the other side. She had stabbed through the partition with a long ceremonial blade.
  
“Come back to the room Mike. I can fuck you while you die?”
  
I blinked in disbelief and pain, trying to work out whether she had already killed me…
  
“It was going to be Sak…that fucking himbo…but he went and killed himself before I could” Lydia let out a weird little giggle. “So it’ll just have to be you…come on Mike…Look at you…you’ve got plenty of body to spare…do something good for once in your life and die…die so my brother can live.” Lydia plunged the sword again through the slats as hard and fast as she could and the tip buried itself in my gut. Shallow, but enough to hurt. 
  
The sword was long and could reach me through the wall. I had to run. 
  
This time Lydia was following. Alternating between screaming and laughing. Matching me step for step on the other side of the wall. Periodically she would thrust the sword again, opening up a new nick on my body, but her aim was bad. Neither of us could move quickly…both of us were bloodied and hurt as we moved down the corridors. 
  
I thanked the stars for this small wall between us but was already wondering what I’d do if these corridors merged? If I rounded a corner and found myself face to face with the girl I had once loved…who had now become the very minotaur I’d most feared. Could I kill her before she killed me? Did I have that in me…
  
The corridor forked the other way and my relief was immeasurable. I ran and found Lydia’s voice growing fainter away from me. I ran, ignoring the grating sensation in my leg and the blood pumping out of my back. 
  
I ran until I found myself back in the chamber where this all began. I ran so quickly that I couldn’t stop myself. I stepped out and realised that there was nothing below my foot apart from a cavernous drop down to the stone floor below. A bone breaking drop that would have proved fatal were in not for the arm that grabbed me. 
  
I dangled for a moment…one foot out over the abyss before the person pulled me backwards. 
  
Before I could thank my saviour  I heard Lydia’s voice again and my blood froze. 
  
“Please Mike…no one will ever love you like I do…Who else would want to fuck that flabby burnt body of yours…please? Let’s be broken together…” Lydias voice fluttered down from the end of the tunnel and I realised she had caught up with me. 
  
Her body came exploding out of the mists as she charged at me like a bull…the ceremonial blade outstretched and ready to run me through. 
  
I was too tired to save my life any more but again the hand pulled me backwards in the nick of time. 
  
The sword carved through the spot where I had been standing moments before, followed by Lydia…her momentum carrying her over the edge. I could see the shock on her face as she realised there was no more floor and then she fell. Down past the arena like steps on all sides…a drop that there was no surviving. Her head bounced on the penultimate step and her spine curved around until she kicked herself in the face and then the jumbled mess that had once been Lydia crashed to the floor. 
  
The crunch was terrible, even from up here.
  
I peered out over the ledge at the ruined remains of Lydia’s once perfect body.
  
“Muh…Mi…ke…mmmm…Miiiii….Mike. Mike…Muh” the sound drifted up…as her mouth moved and the remnant of her brain tried to make a final thought. Her limbs were contorted at impossible angles, bones poking through the skin, a shattered wreck. It seemed cruel that the universe would so thoroughly break something that had once been so beautiful. Lydia was now a twitching blob, just waiting for death to take her.
  
And it did. 
  
As I watched the door to the sauna opened and in walked one of those cloaked watchers. The sight of them struck a fear in me. I didn’t realise they could come in here…I had thought that this world would keep us safe from them…but it had no interest in me. 
  
The watcher entered, hand in hand with a small boy…a child no older than 5 years old…with the same sandy blonde hair and mousey features as his sister. 
  
The boy looked up at me for a moment and the same look of mad hatred that Lydia had given me crossed his little features. Then his hand made contact with the coal pit and he was gone. Back to the living world. Lydia had got what she’d always wanted…but it had cost her everything. 
  
The watcher scooped up her decimated body, her mouth still uselessly trying to make words, her eyes desperately roaming around the room…still not certain that she was dead. 
  
The watcher took her all the same. Out and away through that exit that didn’t belong to us…out into a sandstorm of red winds beyond…and then the door closed and Lydia was no more.
  

  
Andy touched me gently on the arm and with a sad nod began to climb up and away. 
  
I watched him go…I hadn’t seen him properly in a fortnight, but he looked so different. 
  
Older. Less sinewy…and more barrel like. Somehow more…stately. There was no mistaking that it was Andy, but he was no longer the retiree that took care of his body…he had someone how become one of the sad ailing old men who spend their lives basting themselves and cooking in a…
  
He looked like a roman emperor
  
“Are you coming?” He said in a voice that had changed as well. The cheeky fun all gone and replaced with a strange solemnity. 
  
“Coming where?”
  
“Up” Andy smiled.
  
“What’s up there?” I asked dumbly.
  
“A group of men…much like me…we sit and chat…and watch the world go by. But we really see it Mike. We see it all…this world, and more…their pasts, presents and futures…we sit at the top of the sauna and we pass our judgements and where we can…we help.” Andy looked at me sadly “we try our best. You’ve lost so much Mike…so much weight…there’s barely anything tethering you down any more…you’ve done well. There’s a seat up there for you. If you want it.”
  
I stood. Not knowing what to do or say…I tried to picture the summit. The top of this upside down pyramid of steps and the committee of fat old men who sat there. 
  
A group of men who had stepped out of time to stare down into the mists below and see the world go by. A ring of men with wrinkled skin and withered dicks. 
  
Is that what I wanted to become?
  
“Can I think about it?”
  
“Of course.” Andy smiled “you know where to find us.” And up he went…away into the darkness. 
  

  
I went back down, down to the coals even though the timer had long since run out. 
  
I touched the coals and found myself in my home DIY sauna again…the walls and ceiling on fire…Lydias corpse on the floor, burning away gently, and clutched in her hand that long ceremonial blade, beginning to glow red.
  
I left quickly and closed the door behind me.
  
Smoke billowed into the night air as my Sauna turned into a bonfire.
  

  
And now I’m here. Letting you know how all this ends. 
  
I think I’ve got another few more moments before my little sauna collapses…enough time to spin a timer one last time, pour a ladle on what remains of the coal pit and get back to that other world…
  
I’ve been on the bottom of life for so long…just another one of you fucking losers and I’ve had enough. I’m going to join the men who sit at the top…those men who sit in judgement on all things…
  
But before I go back I’m going to pass judgement here. My unfaithful wife is still asleep in the room next door and now… she’ll never wake…her nor the bastard inside her. 
  
I’ll have my revenge on her for…and all the women who tried to take from me. 
  
Lydia’s ceremonial sword is still hot on my lap…I’ll wake her just before I do it. I want to see the look in her eyes.
  
All I wanted to do was lose a bit of weight…and she’s the last thing to go.
