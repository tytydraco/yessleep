I didn’t want to go camping, but the trip was a compromise with my husband. In the spring, I’d go sleep in a tent with him. Six months later, in the dead of winter, we’d go to an all inclusive beach resort for me. See? Compromise.

The drive was long, and made even longer by the fact that my husband was a constant fidgeter - always tapping his fingers, jiggling his leg, combing his fingers through his hair, and otherwise shifting about.

Truthfully, I’d never even considered camping before. My parents didn’t believe in it. They’d grown up poor, and sleeping in the open air with no plumbing or electricity was too close to their own childhoods.

When I told my Mom about our upcoming trip, she shook her head derisively. But when I told her exactly where we were going, she gasped, her eyes wide, and whispered, as if reciting from memory, “In the mountains older than bones, strange things hunger for them.”

“Wait here,” she urged, before going upstairs. When she returned, she pressed a necklace into my palm - my grandmother’s amethyst pendant. She held my hand in both of hers, and squeezed them before continuing.

“When your father and I left the woods, it wasn’t just because we were poor...”

I made a noncommittal hum of acknowledgement and pulled my hand away to inspect the jewel, only half-listening.

“There’s things in the forest we wanted to protect you from…” She gripped my forearm painfully tight to get my attention, and I startled.

“Listen to me. I don’t want you to go, but if you do, once the sun sets, don’t talk to anybody you hadn’t set eyes on before nightfall.”

My Mom’s stare was intense, her voice tight as she kept going, “I don’t care if you hear someone screaming for help. I don’t care if someone you think you know walks up. Jesus himself can come down from heaven, but don’t you speak to him.“

And then I did the most normal thing in the world - I laughed it off.

“Got it!” I said, as I kissed her cheek, and gathered my things to leave. “Don’t talk to strangers!”

We made it to the woods without a problem. And I was wearing the necklace. I liked amethyst, and I loved my grandma so there was no reason not to.

I’d pledged not to grumble or complain on the trip, and it truly was pleasant while we hiked to the campground. My husband set up our tent, and I started making campfire chili.

Everything was going perfectly. Dinner was good, and we’d just started roasting smores when it suddenly felt like the temperature dropped at least twenty degrees. I exhaled and saw my breath. 

“It just got really cold,” he said.

“Yeah,” I agreed. 

There was a loud crack in the woods, like a tree branch snapping, behind us and we spun around. Then one in front. Then two to either side. We were surrounded but couldn’t see anyone. There was a rustle, a susurration of whispers, voice-like, but indecipherable.

“Hell-“ my husband started to call.

“Shhh!” I hissed at him. He looked at me in confusion, but I just knew, deep down in my bones, that talking to whatever was out there would be seen as an invitation.

“I’m just trying to see - “

“Stop talking,” I whispered.

From the edge of the clearing, a man-shaped silhouette shuffled in. Then another. And another. And more. At first, I thought they were wearing costumes, then my brain caught up to what my eyes really saw, and I realized they were skeletons.

A moment later, it registered that they were incomplete skeletons. Every single one was missing parts. One had a cranium but no jaw. Another only had a half rib cage. Another was missing an arm.

“Hello….,” the largest one creaked.

“Friendssss…,” wheezed another.

“Don’t speak to them,” I ground out through clenched teeth. 

“Spare…”

“A…”

“Bone…”

“For…”

“Us…?”

I gripped the amethyst pendant with one hand, and held my husband’s hand with the other. Instantly, I felt as if something grounded me in place, like a root extending from the base of my spine into the earth. A tendril of unseen protection weaved through my fingers and into my husband, connecting us. 

“So…”

“Many…”

“Bones…”

“Only…”

“Need…”

“Few…”

The weight of their presence pushed in from all sides. The amethyst warmed in my grip. I barely breathed. 

But my husband, my poor, fidgety husband, let go of my hand for just for a moment, unthinkingly, to push up his glasses.

The bone men turned their full attention to him, and almost faster than I could blink, one skeletal arm yanked him away.

I reached for him on instinct. The amethyst flared white hot in my palm and I felt an invisible hand shove on my sternum, pushing me back. 

I’ll never forget his look of terror before he disappeared in a circle of bones.

There was one sharp, short scream. Followed by a wet, hacking cough, bubbling gurgles, and the plopping sounds of wetness hitting the forest floor. 

When the noises ended, the circle opened. The original bone men were complete. And there among them, a new one, the same height as my husband, slick and shiny, and missing several pieces. 

They turned as one and left. 

The rest of the night, I stayed in place, curled into a tight ball. Afraid to speak, afraid to move, lest the slightest rustle bring them back. Just as dawn broke, a family of campers stumbled upon me. They called the rangers when I didn’t respond. 

I was catatonic, they said. 

In the hospital, I was interviewed repeatedly. From their perspective, nothing in my story made sense, but it was explained away as shock and trauma. A few days later they found his “remains.” I didn’t ask to see what they found. It was a closed casket funeral.

My parents have tried to reach me. To tell me more about our family’s history, they said. I haven’t seen or spoken to them since the burial. But sometimes, when it’s very late, I feel a chill, the amethyst warms against my skin, and something deep in my bones tells me not to make a sound.
