CW: Abusive content and disturbing imagery

The hum of the fluorescent lights behind me receded as Mara guided me through the twisted maze of cages. Each step hammered into me the brutal reminder of what would happen to me if I failed, and the weight of what I needed to do settled firmly across my shoulders. Passing them, the air changed, smelling of rot and despair, thick enough to taste. The women didn’t flinch. They were shadows of themselves, hollow shells whose eyes begged for help, but whose mouths could not. I felt rage coil inside me, tighter than the marks that still burned my wrists. It became fuel for me. I would not be them. I would not let him name me. I would not end up in a cage.

Mara led me toward a stairwell at the end of the corridor, past all of the cages. It was narrow and unstable, with peeling paint and wood warped by age. She stepped up on the first step, stopping for me to follow. Before I could climb up, she reached for my wrists, fumbling with something in her pockets.

“Hold still.” She murmured, pulling the handcuff key out of her apron.

She wrapped her fingers around my wrist and slipped the key into the hole. A click echoed faintly in the hallway as the burdensome metal restraints dropped away from my skin, leaving deep red impressions behind. I stared at her, stunned. I hadn’t expected mercy. I had given up on it.

She met my eyes, her expression remaining blank.

“You’ll need your hands free for this.”

I opened my mouth, unsure what to say, but she spoke again, her voice low and fierce.

“Listen to me, Emily. Whatever he tells you or does to you… Whatever he makes you feel… it isn’t real unless you let it be, understand? He only wins if you break.”

She paused, searching my face.

“Don’t break, Emily.”

She took a step back, tightening her jaw as the emotions welled up inside her.

“This goes up,” she whispered, almost reverent. “He doesn’t expect anyone to reach it. The others never try.”

I hesitated.

“Up there…” I swallowed hard. “You mean to him?”

Her gaze dropped, haunted and unreadable.

“Yes. But don’t expect me to help you beyond this.” She hesitated, just long enough for me to see her stoic expression fracture. “I can’t. Not anymore. He has hollowed me out, carving pieces away until there was nothing left. I can walk this place freely, but I can’t change anything. I’m like a ghost, bound to this place. You’ll have to do this on your own.”

Her words sent a stinging chill up my spine. I could feel her pain as if it were my own.

I clenched my fists, tasting the metallic tang of fear on my tongue, coupled with fire, burning hot within me.

I followed her up the stairs, the steps groaning under our weight. Each creak rang out loudly, exploding through the silence, but we remained undetected. When we reached the top of the stairs, Mara grabbed my shoulder and slid a finger over her lips. We had come too far to get caught now. We had to remain silent.

The upper floor hallway was completely different from everything else. It was sterile and pristine, a new addition by the looks of it. The air reeked with a sick cocktail of antiseptic and decay.

Ahead of us sat a single door at the far end of the hall. As we approached it, I felt him. The weight of his dark, malicious presence. A cold, familiar certainty that had haunted me since the first time I heard him say my name.

Mara stopped at the threshold. Her hand hovered over the handle as if touching it would burn her.

“This is it,” she said softly. “Once you go in… there’s no turning back.”

I nodded. I didn’t need her permission. I’d waited too long and suffered too much.

She stepped back, her face slipping back into neutrality.

“Finish this, Emily.” She said, as she pulled the door shut, disappearing back into the hell that awaited her downstairs.

I slipped further inside.

The room was enormous, lit only by the faint glow of moonlight through a tall window. Shadows stretched across the wooden floor like long, crooked fingers.

At first, everything was quiet. Almost too quiet. My own breathing sounded like a powered vacuum in my ears compared to the silence. My footsteps echoed in the giant room, even though I was stepping carefully, trying to remain quiet.

I made my way across the room, turning a corner to reveal the entire upper level. Hallways and rooms stretched in each direction, some doors hanging crooked on their hinges, others closed tight as if hiding something behind them. Dust floated in the thin slivers of moonlight, twisting like tiny ghosts along the draft. The air was thick and stale, carrying the musty smell of sweat and decay through the halls.

The place looked abandoned. It was clear nothing here had been cleaned or touched by human hands in months or years. I continued to move cautiously, senses straining, every shadow appearing as a possible threat.

 I peeked into a room on the left. It was a bedroom, but just barely. The mattress lay directly on the floor, stained dark, sheets clinging to it like decaying skin that had begun sloughing away. Crumpled clothing and greasy remnants of takeout containers littered the corners, mold crawling over everything it could reach. There was a mirror opposite the bed smeared with fingerprints and small, frantic scratches as if someone had been clawing at it, desperately trying to escape their reflection.

I stumbled back, bile bubbling up in my throat, but I forced myself to continue.

Down the hall, I found what must have been his living space. A dilapidated couch sagged in the center of the room, stuffing spilling out like entrails. A flickering TV hummed in static, dragging back memories of my first days here.

Tables were stacked with notebooks, pages scrawled in frantic handwriting, listing dozens of women’s names. My stomach churned at the sight, but I forced my legs forward.

At the far end of the hall, a door stood slightly ajar, a faint light spilling from it. I paused, taking a deep, steady breath, and pushed it open.

And there he was.

He sat behind a desk, casual, almost paternal in his posture, as if the basement levels and the horrors they held never existed. His hair clung to his scalp in oily mats, his skin still ghostly white, glistening with sweat. His fingernails were cracked, coated in black grime. Every crease of him seemed steeped in filth.

His stench hit me, even from across the room, a nauseating mix of rot and something sour, nearly knocking me off my feet.

My blood ran cold as he looked up from his notebook, a smile spreading across his face that promised pain without hesitation.

“Emily,” he said softly, almost delighted. “I wondered how long it would take you.”

I felt Mara’s presence behind me, her shadow stretching along the wall. She didn’t move forward right away, remaining loyal in ways I still couldn’t understand.

My hands trembled. Panic clawed at my mind, threatening to tear everything apart, but then I felt the floorboards creak beneath me. Mara had snuck up right behind me, using my silhouette in the doorway to hide her movement from his view. I felt her push something hard and cold onto my palm.

An urgent whisper slid into my ear, cutting through the tension and snapping me back to reality.

“Finish it.”

I looked down to see a jagged kitchen knife gleaming faintly in the moonlight. I swallowed hard, gripping it until my knuckles turned white. Fear still rattled in my chest, but my focus sharpened. I couldn’t back out now. I had prepared myself for this moment.

He rose, gliding toward me with that same calm, unnatural grace.

“You still think you’re someone, huh?” He asked, chuckling lightly.

“I am,” I whispered, voice trembling but firm as I raised the knife. “And I am going to kill you.”

He laughed even louder, making the hair on my neck stand on end.

“Bold. I like that. But you’re all alone. You can’t…”

I lunged without hesitation, cutting him off mid-sentence.

The knife plunged into his side before he could react fully. His eyes widened, and for the first time, I saw shock and pain flicker through them. It made me almost dizzy with its unfamiliarity. He stumbled back, clutching the wound, deep red blood spreading across his filth-covered shirt, soaking into every inch.

Rage twisted his features, warping him into something different now that he was stripped of his false civility. He lunged for me, unnaturally fast despite the wound.

Adrenaline shot through me as the knife’s cold weight settled back into my hand. Mara’s words echoed in my ears, faint but clear.

“Finish it.”

My grip tightened around the handle, the blood-slick steel grounding me. I drew a quick breath, letting the fear sharpen my senses, ready for whatever he brought next.

He came across the table, swiping at me wildly and snarling in pain. His blood-soaked shirt dragged on the edge of the table, yanking him back, his fingers barely scraping past my arms as I sidestepped him. I lunged back at him, swinging blindly.

The jagged blade tore into his side, sinking deep between his ribs. His voice exploded into a deep, guttural scream that ripped across the room. Blood poured from the wound, spraying across the table and my arms. I could feel the putrid, sticky substance clinging to my skin, a violent, wet reminder of how easy life can be taken.

He pressed his hands to his wounds, blood seeping through his fingers as he steadied himself on his feet. His eyes locked on me, feral and full of hate. He screamed, then lunged at me again. I jerked aside, driving the knife into his shoulder as his momentum took him past me. Pain, shock, and disbelief flickered across his face, emotions I never thought I’d see in him. He stumbled, crashing into a wooden chair, sending notebooks and papers flying into the air, smeared in dark red.

He rolled over amid the debris to face me, coughing as he tried to haul himself upright.

“You think you can stop this?” he hissed, voice wet, choking down the blood in his throat. “You’ve done nothing. They’re already broken beyond repair.”

I stared at him, the fire in my chest coiling, sharp and merciless. Words were no longer necessary. I’d seen and heard enough. I wouldn’t let him steal another breath, another piece from me.

I slashed again and again, each strike fueled by months of fear, by the hollowed eyes of the women in cages, by every tear Mara and Lilith shed on the cold floor. He collapsed to the floor, thrashing violently, gurgling curses that ended in wet, rattling gasps. His body rebelled against him, limbs jerking uselessly as each labored breath refused to come cleanly. The cold, untouchable certainty in his eyes cracked and crumbled away, revealing raw, unbridled fear in its place. He had become more animal than man, the source of fear and torment for so many, now a writhing, bloody mass on the wooden floor.

Blood bubbled at the corner of his mouth as he tried to speak, barely dragging in air, yet no words came. Whatever he meant to say was never fully formed, wheezing and garbled words masking it. His fingers twitched weakly at my feet, as if I might save him.

I stepped back.

I didn’t want to hear any more.

I heard Mara move behind me, almost undetectable, like a ghost. She paused, sweeping her eyes over him, taking in the carnage at her feet. The man who had tormented her body and mind for so many years lay there wheezing his final breaths.

Her gaze lingered, unflinching. I could see the weight she carried in the set of her shoulders, the painful echo of years spent in chains and fear, forced to a life of twisted servitude.

She didn’t speak immediately. When she did, her voice was rough and strained, as if she hadn’t spoken in months.

“Years…” she murmured. “Years I’ve been here… too long. I’ve felt him in every breath, every second of every day. He changed me… hurt me. But… but I’m still here.”

Her eyes flicked up to me.

“We’re still here.”

She moved toward the desk, cold determination filling every step. Her fingers shook as she grabbed the keyring off his desk, keys that had locked countless women away to be used and forgotten.

She held them for a moment, almost reverently, then shoved them into my hand.

“Go,” she said, sternly. “Free them.”

I didn’t hesitate. I tore through the corridors until the basement door was finally in sight. The stairwell yawned before me, the darkness below threatening.

The screams flooded me the moment I turned the handle on the basement door, a tidal wave of sound, raw and overwhelming. Women stumbled forward, some frozen, some crawling, some screaming their names at me, as if saying them aloud could pull them back into their old life before the cages, before he got to them.

The keys rattled in my trembling hands as I flew from cage to cage. The locks clattered on the concrete, some fused to flesh, some rusted and half-hanging on. Tears fell freely as chains fell from thin, bruised wrists and ankles. I ripped their restraints free, forcing their bodies upright. Some fell under their own weight, while others scratched and screamed for salvation.

I gathered as many as I could, those who would let me help them, to guide them out of that horrid place. The basement itself seemed alive, shaking in anger at our defiance and lust for freedom. We moved slowly, each step a battle, each breath harder than the last. The passages and corridors seemed alien to some, but for others, it seemed as though they had mapped the entire place in their minds, almost leading ahead of me.

Mara had descended the stairs back to the basement. She lingered at the back of the corridor, her pale, tear-streaked face framed by the shadows and flickering light. She watched us as we pushed our way out, silent, unmoving, her hands still trembling from the years of torment, but her eyes fixed on the freedom spilling through the halls. She didn’t follow. This place had taken too much from her to let her survive the light above. I gave her a last, desperate glance, pleading with her to follow. All she gave me was a smile. She didn’t owe me anything. She had handed me the keys, and that was enough. That was all that mattered now.

I guided them upward, moving through the chaos of stumbling bodies, pulling and urging them to keep moving. I held hands, lifted bodies, cut through cords, whispered encouragement. The weight of years underground, of hunger, filth, and fear, fell away in bursts of pain and laughter as we finally reached the entrance door. With a few shoves, the latch came free, opening into the cold night, air sharp in our lungs, stars burning bright overhead.

Some of them clung to me, sobbing and shaking. Others screamed in shock at the sensation of fresh air on their skin, light in their eyes. Several women screamed the moment they crossed the threshold, collapsing to the ground as if the air in their lungs was too much to handle. A few shielded their eyes, whimpering, as if the darkness above might cave in on them the way it always had before.

Grass crunched beneath their bare feet. Some of them dropped to their knees, clawing at it with shaking hands, fingers digging into soil, making sure it was all real. One woman pressed her face into the ground and laughed hysterically, the sound breaking apart, quickly transforming into violent sobs.

“I can feel it,” she whispered over and over. “I can feel the ground.”

None of us knew where we were. But we knew that we were no longer in cages. That’s what mattered.

The house loomed behind us, its massive, dilapidated frame standing out against the night sky like a monument of rot and despair. The windows stared blankly into the dark, following us like cold, dead eyes as we fled. We ran across the yard, expecting lights… streetlamps, a road, anything, but there was nothing there. There were no neighboring houses, nor a road leading away. There were only trees. Endless trees swallowed the edges of the property, their twisted branches creaking softly in the night wind as they closed in around us.

Even now, knowing that we were free, the feeling of pure isolation struck hard. Panic rippled through the group as the reality of it set in.

“Where are we?” one woman cried.

“Is this still part of it?” another whispered, terror seeping back into her voice.

“I can’t go back,” one woman screamed suddenly, scrambling to her feet and spinning wildly in circles. “I won’t go back…I… I won’t. I won’t.”

“Hey,” I said sharply, grabbing her shoulders before she could run. She flinched violently at my touch, eyes wild, pupils blown wide. I loosened my grip immediately once I saw the pure terror sink back into her face.

“Hey, listen to me. You’re outside. You’re free. He can’t hurt you anymore.”

She didn’t seem to hear me as she just stared at my mouth, watching the words come out as if she had lost all understanding of them.

That’s when I began to realize just how deep the damage truly went.

Some of them no longer knew how to exist without commands or abuse. They had been told when to sleep, when to eat, and even when to suffer. Freedom wasn’t relief. It was confusion. It became the same terror, but without cage walls.

“Stay together,” I said, louder now. “Please. Everyone, stay together.”

Keeping twenty-seven tortured women in one group together was much easier said than done.

One woman tried to run toward the trees before collapsing from exhaustion. Another had backtracked and curled herself into a ball near the porch steps, rocking back and forth, whispering a name I doubted anyone had heard in years. A few clung to each other desperately, arms locked so tightly their knuckles turned white.

I knew I needed to do something soon, or this would have all been for nothing. We were out of our cages, now surrounded by nothing but dark, cold forest, which I knew could be just as cruel as the cages had been.

My hands shook as I plunged them into my pockets, checking to see if I had grabbed anything in the midst of our jailbreak. I dug deep but found nothing.

We had no phone. No watch. No idea what time it was… or even what year, for that matter.

We were free… but completely lost.

The house stood on a massive stretch of land, deliberately isolated. He had planned it this way… for all of our screams to go unheard and for no one to stumble across this place by accident.

We could scream until our throats bled, and no one would come.

Suddenly, through the trees, I saw movement. It was brief, but unmistakable. It was a pair of headlights.

At first, I thought I was imagining it, but soon, a low hum drifted through the trees, distant but growing louder by the second. Several women froze all at once, terror flashing across their faces.

“No,” someone whispered. “No, he…he’s back.”

“It’s not him,” I said quickly, though my heart pounded violently in my chest. “He can’t…he’s not.”

The headlights cut through the trees, blades of light slicing through the darkness.

A car slowed near the edge of the property, tires crunching on gravel we hadn’t noticed until now. Both doors opened, and two men stepped out, sweeping flashlights across the dark toward the house.

I crouched down quickly, trying to make myself as small as possible, almost hoping they wouldn’t see me. I was still so traumatized.

“This is it.” One of them said.

“Wow, it’s an even bigger shithole than how you described it.” The other said back.

They slowly approached us, talking amongst themselves about how they had heard stories about the house and how they were going to investigate and film for a YouTube video they were making.

As they turned the corner into the massive yard, the leading man pointed his flashlight directly at me.

“Holy shit!” He yelled, jerking his body backward so hard that he almost fell.

“What? What is it?” The other one yelled in return.

He scanned with his flashlights across the yard, revealing the dozens of barefoot and bloodied women Mara and I had dragged out, all wrapped in torn clothing and blankets, crying so hard that their bodies had begun shaking.

He froze.

“Oh my god,” he breathed.

I stumbled forward, hands raised instinctively, afraid sudden movement might send them running.

“Please,” I pleaded, voice breaking. “We need help. Please.”

He took one look at his partner but didn’t hesitate after that.

Their phones came out immediately. Their voices shook as they spoke, their words tumbling over each other in disbelief.

“Th…There are women here… so many of them… They’re all cut up… please hurry.”

One of the men stayed on the phone with the police while the other walked up to me and handed me his jacket.

Minutes later, the sound of sirens cut through the night, bringing a sense of relief and joy that I haven’t been able to replicate since.

Red and blue lights washed over the yard, flashing across hollow faces and shaking bodies. Some women screamed again, collapsing to the ground as the noise overwhelmed them. Others stared in stunned silence, mouths open wide, as if afraid this too would disappear if they reacted too strongly.

The police officers almost didn’t know how to react toward us. They moved carefully, slowly, like approaching injured animals, unpredictable and confused. They draped thick wool blankets over our shoulders, asking questions in gentle voices that most of the women either couldn’t or wouldn’t answer.

Some had completely forgotten who they were, or who they used to be. For others, time had fractured, the harsh reality of years having passed them by, leaving an indelible mark on them. This new reality was fragile.

I watched one woman flinch violently when an officer reached out to help her stand. Another burst into tears because someone said her name aloud… not a number or a command… her real name.

Not long after that, ambulances came, bringing with them more lights, more voices, and more unanswered questions.

The police cordoned off the house, forcing its doors open and finally dragging its secrets into the light. I didn’t want to watch. I couldn’t. I stood barefoot in the grass, shaking uncontrollably, watching women be guided toward safety. Some had miscarried during the escape and had to be carried on stretchers to receive fluids and blood. Some were too injured to walk and were supported under each arm. And then, some walked on their own, maintaining their fierce, stubborn resolve to the end.

As I watched, I felt someone step beside me. It was Mara.

She looked smaller outside, pale and fragile, like the house had been the only thing holding her upright all these years.

She stared at the sky for a long time before taking a deep breath and looking over at me.

“I forgot it was this big,” she said quietly.

I pushed air through my nose and nodded. I didn’t know what to say to that. I couldn’t imagine what she was feeling. I had only witnessed a glimpse of what she had been through, and yet, it felt like an eternity.

Eventually, the world began to make sense again. But only barely.

They took us away, treated our wounds, and questioned us even more, the answers to which would never come out.

They gave us food we could barely stomach in rooms full of light we could barely tolerate. We had survived for so long without these luxuries that having them now felt wrong. It all felt so foreign.

Sleep didn’t come easily, often coming in fractured pieces filled with waking nightmares and screaming. Shadows filled each corner, daring us to dream… daring us to remember.

The scars didn’t fade. They still haven’t.

In the days that followed, the story broke everywhere. The police had pieced his identity together quickly through property records, missing persons reports, and a trail of paperwork he’d been arrogant enough to leave behind. His face appeared on screens. His history unraveled across the news behind neat, steady anchors who knew nothing about who he truly was.

I only saw the coverage once.

When they said they were going to release his name, I turned away, lowering the volume to zero. I focused my gaze on the pattern of the carpet and tried to steady my ragged breathing. I couldn’t afford to listen. Allowing myself to hear his name felt like I’d be giving him an invitation into my mind once again. As if speaking it aloud would let him reach through the screen and claim the space inside my head.

I still didn’t know if I actually killed him that night, but I wasn’t going to allow him back into my head. Not again.

I have to live with it, along with all the other women who endured this. We have to live with the days when silence grows too loud, when the world feels too close. Or when every touch or common human interaction makes you flinch in fear. Those are the true scars we carry from this. But we live, and that’s what matters.

I carry what I did that night with me always. I can still feel the violence, the blood, and the surge of adrenaline I felt as we pushed through that door.

I will never be the person I was before that man and that house.

But I am still here.

Because I chose to fight that night instead of just lying down and taking his punishment, dozens of women woke up to the sunlight on their faces this morning.

Freedom isn’t clean or gentle. It doesn’t erase the actions you take, or the blood you spill.

But it is real. And sometimes, real is as much as you can ask for.
