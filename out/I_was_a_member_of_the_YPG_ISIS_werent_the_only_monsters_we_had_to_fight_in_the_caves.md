After my time in the Marine Corps was up, I didn't know what to do with myself. Reenlisting wasn't appealing, but I had gone into the Corps fresh out of high school. I had heard about a handful of guys I knew going to help the YPG in their fight against ISIS,Turkey, and more to reclaim their homes. For some reason, I felt that I needed to help the Kurds. Maybe it was because we abandoned them to fight for themselves, but two weeks after returning from the USMC, I researched how to join, and just a week later, I was getting ready to board a flight to the Middle East. A buddy of mine, Colt, was already there and some nice pieces of kit waiting for me, including a rifle he pulled off a dead ISIS fighter.

&#x200B;

I arrived in Germany, and took a few small flights, which had me close to Syria. I wasn't sure where I was, but "Reno", a Mexican volunteer met me at the airport I was at, and drove us for a while, until we arrived at a small hut, accustomed to what you'd see small farmers living in in places such as Afghanistan. From there, we walked a few kilometers up the steep hillsides nearby until we reached a small opening in the mountain covered by cloth. He gestured for me to enter, and I did. I looked around at the lanterns hanging from the walls and ceiling, and a few troops with plate carriers and rifles, standing around the light. The atmosphere was relaxed for the situation we were in.

&#x200B;

On top of ISIS and other insurgent groups, Turkish jets and drones dropped ordnance on the hillsides where they knew we were. Just as Reno introduced me to some members of our unit, the mountain shook with the sound of an explosion, and dust fell from the cave ceiling. The group laughed, as I stood there anxiously waiting for another. Another explosion rocked the surrounding area. 

&#x200B;

"Don't worry Yankee, it's the bomb you don't hear that kills you." Spoke "Chez", a Kurdish fighter. 

&#x200B;

I knew this of course from my time in the marines, but never once was I the intended target of an airstrike. It was a humbling experience.

&#x200B;

Colt walked into the clearing in the center of the room, with two Ak-47's, and threw one to me, which I barely caught. 

&#x200B;

"Know how to shoot you sorry son of a bitch?" He said, cracking a grin. 

&#x200B;

I hadn't seen him since he left the Marines two years ago, so I was excited to see my former battle buddy again. I felt at home again, which I hadn't felt in a while. The men I served with were a mix of Kurds, former western troops, and a few crazy civilians from western countries. It was implied that members from the international scene must at least have some military training, but the group did their best to teach those that had little to no combat experience or training. 

&#x200B;

Our sleeping quarters were just small areas of the cave where we put mats down, and slept in our sleeping bags on top of the mats. We all used radios to communicate with each other and other units of the YPG. Occasionally you'd hear frantic screaming and gunfire, but that was the life we had here. I felt the camaraderie quickly, and the other members treated me like an old friend.

&#x200B;

The following day, I went on a patrol with a Reno, Colt, and other members of the unit. There had been reports of a group of around 10 YPG guys getting wiped out in an instant. Reno had mentioned that snipers were a huge threat, so he and Colt figured that the group must have been ambushed by a combination of snipers and machine gunners. It seemed obvious to assume, but there was so much unknown that it helped to have some semblance of understanding of what was happening.

&#x200B;

We slowly approached the are where the group went missing, a small cave entrance on a hillside overlooking the valley we patrolled, which was opposite to our cave system. Reno and Colt led, Chez stood just behind me. We moved very, very slowly, checking every possible area for snipers. We got closer and closer to the entrance, and no snipers shot at us. This was greatly unusual. Normally, at least one of us would have been killed by now if these snipers were still here. Of course, this sounds stupid, but we were eager to kill ISIS, and strangely enough, we gave up some rationality.

&#x200B;

Soon, we reached the entrance of the cave. Just as we did, a massive dog, which must have been 6 feet tall at least, and had a beautiful, gray and tan coat. We stood there, mesmerized, we didn't even draw our weapons. At this point, shit got weird. It turned around, walking into the cave. We followed. It was like we were hypnotized, we mindlessly followed it into the cave, walking by the blood stains, bullet impacts, and bones on the floor. We walked deeper and deeper into the cave, and a hand pulled me into a small space. I saw a Kurdish fighter holding his finger over my mouth, shushing me, with the lighting from the cave entrance barely illuminating his face. 

&#x200B;

I watched the rest of the group follow the dog, and when I glanced at the fighter holding me still, his face contorted into a wicked smile, his eyelids seemed to disappear and his face became sunken, his teeth growing, gnashing at me. I pushed myself away from him, grasping my rifle. The others in the group seemed to be lucid again, startled by my cry's for help. The dog swiftly turned around, ripping Colt to pieces. The group shot at the dog while I dumped my rounds into the thing that had ahold of me. It let out an inhuman scream, and thundered down the cave, slashing one of our guys down as it did.

&#x200B;

The lighting from the cave entrance gave us a direction to run. As I neared the entrance, the sound of rotary engines filled my ears. I recognized the sound of an AH-64 Apache Attack helicopter from my time in the marines. I felt good about it at the time, but looking back, I knew why we were there. The coalition Air Forces had contact with the YPG, and we'd call in air strikes for them to kill ISIS. Sometimes, we'd even do specific scouting missions for the coalition, we just wanted to kill ISIS so we obliged. It seems that the coalition thought something was off about this cave, because as I made my way out of the cave, it opened fire with its cannon. Dust and rock fragments were kicked into my face, causing me to slip back into the cave. Then, explosions rocked the areas, and I blacked out.

&#x200B;

I awoke, in complete darkness. I heard my buddies groaning underneath the rubble. I was lucky enough to come to my feet. I took a flashlight from my belt and clicked it on, revealing Chez and Reno to both be in pieces. A few more men were destroyed. There was one fighter, Milo as we called him, pinned halfway under the rubble. We begged for my help in broken English, and I  grabbed his shoulders, and pulled him. He stopped making noise, and I noticed that he was completely in half. He died right there. I found a rifle on the ground, and shouldered it, trying to figure out how to get out of there. 

&#x200B;

I wandered down the cave system, not seeing any trace of the dog or thing that grabbed me. I took every corner slowly. That was until, I heard yelling and growling behind me, obviously being that thing from earlier. Knowing that there was likely no exit, I ran. I heard it behind me, yelling more and more. As I made my way further into the cave, I noticed light around a corner. It was an exit. I sprinted to it, even throwing down my rifle to speed up. I jumped out into the light, rolling down the hill. I looked back, and watched it wicked face in a twisted grin, its jagged teeth and sunken eyes directed straight towards me. It screeched, and ran back into the cave.

&#x200B;

I got up and wandered around until I found a road, which I followed until I flagged down a car, which happened to be western YPG volunteers. Over the next few weeks, I made it back to the US, and was even interviewed by an agent from the CIA. I'm writing this from my home, but what happened that day will never leave my mind.
