I was 16 years old when this happened to me, so it’s quite some time ago and I don’t recall every single detail, what I know for sure is the whole thing took about 5-8 minutes before it was over.

English is not my first language, please excuse me if some sentences are grammatically incorrect or just phrased wrong in general, I’m trying my best :)

To explain my situation:
I live in a part of germany where we still have many old buildings and structures from long ago standing in close vicinity to pretty much everyday normal life, old castles or entire abandoned factories are very common here and no one really looks into them any closer than from the outside since they are just used to it and absolute disinterested in exploring them due to it being part of everyday life here.

I am personally very interested in these past structures and buildings and explore them quite frequently, it always feels very nostalgic to me and I never understood why, but something about the places I visit just feels like I’ve been there before so it’s kind of a nice thing to do whenever I have nothing to do.

I remember this one time when I went to one of our older abandoned buildings, it was part of a huge castle/palace structure and is one of the last Buildings left standing, it’s currently being renovated tho and they are completely renewing the left over structures as most of the castle had been destroyed by bombing runs in WWII.

I went and explored for a while, found a couple of empty beer bottles and a bunch of trash, just the usual things you’d expect to find in old structures, people go there and get drunk and vandalise a bit, it’s saddening but it is what it is.

I had spent about 20 minutes there when I started to fell a bit dizzy when I entered one of the larger rooms that were probably used for events or meet-ups, i wasn’t paying attention to my surroundings anymore, tripped and fell, hitting my head on a curb.

This is where it gets interesting
I was wearing grey nike joggers, a black shirt sleeve shirt, a silver necklace and some nikes, I had my phone and a wrist watch on me, 
I had as I said fallen onto a curb and woke back up after some time, the difference tho, was that I wasn’t in the same place anymore, the room i fell in, looked clean and almost brand new, and I was hearing voices, music and people around me, they hadn’t noticed me yet as if had just spawned there when I regained my consciousness. 

I was extremely startled and scared, absolutely confused would be a good way to put it, I stood up and looked at the people around me, I had a pretty bad headache as well, I remember them looking extremely old fashioned, and I mean really old fashioned, almost like they escaped a museum or something.

They reminded me of the people in renaissance movies, maybe not as far back if I’m being honest but they looked very old fashioned, I was looking around and saw no one noticed me as of now so I tried to get away immediately and sprinted outside only to find everything intact with a huge castle and lots of people and servants walking around and tending to the more noble looking people, so I was standing in the middle of that that huge place, right on the property, I decided to check my watch, dead, tried checking my phone, dead, it didn’t take long before someone noticed me and about a minute later everyone was staring at me. 

Some people started to get closer and tried talking to me, some started yelling incoherent stuff, it all sounded like a form of German but I couldn’t understand everything they were saying even tho I’m native German, then it started to get more heated as I noticed armed men coming toward me, I assumed they were guards as they were wearing knights Armor and we’re carrying weapons that I assumed to be halberds.

They got to me and one of them grabbed my right arm which caused some kind of reaction of sorts, the music in the background of the festive activities ceased and the people around me all of a sudden had an empty stare and everything around me collapsed and I woke up in the dirt where I fell, same place I woke up at, just everything back to an abandoned and vandalised state, just the way I had stumbled upon it when I first entered the place.

I went outside and decided to sit down for a while, trying to rework what I had just witnessed, I remembered the guard grabbing me and hurting my arm, so I checked my right arm, and It had a red imprint on it in the form of a hand, that really perplexed me as I had thought I just dreamt the whole ordeal. 

No idea what happened that day, but I don’t want it to happen again
