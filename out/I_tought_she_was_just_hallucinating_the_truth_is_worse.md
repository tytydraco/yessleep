I was showering, when my roomate suddenly started screaming. Luckily I was finished with showering, so I burst into the bedroom. Her hands were shivering and she looked pale.




" Alice, what's wrong? " I said, as my body started to shake out of shock "


" Yo vera, I just saw a hand in the corner of the
 desk.."


" Alice, come on, this is the 5th time. I'm sure you're hallucinating, it's normal, happens to me too."


" No vera, you don't understand! Bro I swear there was a hand.."


"Alice, chill out, let me take you to the kitchen downstairs and  grab you a glass a water so you can calm yourself down. "



While I was grabbing her and walking her downstairs, she was so focused on looking at the desk that she didn't notice I called out her name four times.



" Alice, are you feeling any better now? "


No answer.


" Alice! Please stop this, you're worrying me! "


" Chill out vera, im just.. you know.. just shocked. I'm Glad you came to help me."


" Alice, if this keeps happening over and over, then this is not normal! You should go see a doctor or get help! Please.."


" Vera, I will, don't worry, I will. "


This was the 5th time something like this happened. Last time it was under the bed, the second time it was behind the door, the third time it was under the desk and so on.. I didn't know what was wrong with Alice. I told her so many times that she go see a doctor, yet she still declined when I told her to.


One thing I noticed was, that it was always our bedroom, not the kitchen, not the bathroom or any other place in our apartment other than our bedroom. Something was fishy.. I couldn't understand why. I needed to do something, as this behaviour is not okay, as she also started to avoid showers. 

I decided to spend alot of time in the bedroom. And I bouht a notebook from the store to write about sudden changes in our room.

At the first day of my investiagtion I wrote down how the plushies were positioned on the desk and how our clothes in the closet were hung.
Not only that but I wrote down every single detail down, well not every single but most details of our bedroom. 

I came back from work, every detail was the same as before I wrote on the notebook.

I did this for  a whole week. Literally nothing changed. I wanted to give up but I tought. Why not just do it for one more day, just one more day alright?

I came back after taking a long walk outside the building. I opened up the notebook.

plushies in position? Yep.

are the clothes still the same when I left? Yep.

Are my slippers still in the same position? Yep.

Is my car key still in my drawer? Hold on. What?!

I lost my car key. If Alice were to get the car key of mine then she would have let me know before going somewhere with my car.

I went to Alice, she was chilling on the sofa watching a movie as I walked in.



" Yo vera? Did you borrow  my car key? "


" Nah, why would I, if i needed to go somewhere with your car then I would've let you known. Because my car doesn't start sometimes you know. "


" Vera..I can't find my car key.. It's not in my drawer "


" You can't find it?! Wait hold on, I will also check if my car key is also in the drawer, maybe you left it in my drawer and forgot? "


" Alright.. "


After checking veras drawer, turns out both of our keys were lost.


" What the hell?! How could this be possible? Alice, did your aunt come over? Maybe she accidentaly picked up our keys and drove off with them? "


" Vera, it's true that my aunt accidentaly borrows something when she'snot supposed to, but how could this happen when my aunt wasn't even here? "


" She wasn't here? " I said with a stutter. Because I  had work tomorrow and needed those keys to drive off to work, or else I would be late.


" Vera, I understand, If my key was still here then I would have dropped you off tomorrow, but I can't find it! "


" damnit! What the hell! This is crazy! why would someone even steal our keys, when we're the only people who stay here! "


" I could have dropped them outside.. Come have a look with me, maybe I dropped your keys too. "


" man.. alright.."


" Hold up Vera, are you seeing what i'm seeing? "


" Aren't these our keys?! Hurry let's go grab them "


Turns out, our keys were mysteriously on the ground near a tree. I never saw sommething like this, because we rarely even walk by this tree. But I didn't think much of it as we both happily hugged eachother after a sigh of relief.


" Alice.. what's this red thing in the ground? "


" what do you mean Vera? Oh, yea I see it too. Should we dig it up? "


" Yeah , what if find something valueable haha. "


" haha, yep! Lots of people find things unexpected! "



we started digging up, it was so dug up underground. But we finally managed to get our hands on it.


" what the.. Alice? Are you sure this is a good idea to open this bag with red flames on it? "


" im not sure.. seems like.. you know something big.. I think we should leave "


" Nah, im abput to open this thing, what if it's something valueable? "


This sentence was the biggest regret of my life. As I opened the bag , my hands were shaking, a large amount of blood was coming out of this bag. 


" what the actual f**... yo.. I. "


I tried to finish my sentence. As my eyes caught the worst thing I can't imagine.. I saw hair , literally hair, it was no fur I was  100% sure, real human hair... but... a literal f***ing head was in the bag. A human head. 

Alice was about to faint, my hands were shaking , i  let out a scream that left my throat sore. Tears dripping down my eyes... I could barely feel my legs, because I was so scared. My stomach was literally twisting, I could feel it. I grabbed Alice with me and we both ran of screaming.

Alice was swearing and laid on the ground with hands covering her face while I called the cops.



The truth was revealed as they showed us the history of this building.


1789 this building was built to be the most successfull building in the whole country, lots of people started living here.


But there was one thing that kept them away from being happy.

The souls of the people who died here were roaming around in the building. 

People in this building reported seeing faces behind their doors. Others said they saw a hand wandering around the kitchen.

The first people to die in this building was a family  of 3 their childs name was unknown, the first one to die was the child. They told us the mother was cooking something in the kitchen and left the window open. The child was hungry and started to climb on the counter. As he tried to open the lid he accidently slammed his face and fell through the window, wich later ended up taking his life. 

The mother couldn't handle it and ended up taking her own life, so did the father after 3 years, because he fell into depression.

There were cases were people saw a kid with black eyes near their window. Where as what with Alice happened, they saw a hand.




As soon as we knew the history , we didn't move out of that building, but that town, because we were so scared thhat we didn't even want to live in the same town where this building was.



Alice and I both are feeling safe, but at night it's like this moment will happen to us again. I still can't sleep because I think about this incident. It's like a earworm, but instead of music , it's an image.
