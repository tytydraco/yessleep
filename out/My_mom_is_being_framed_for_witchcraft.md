It’s just me and my mom; my dad knocked her up when she was sixteen and then got arrested for statutory rape. My mom had me and moved us far away. Unfortunately, she hadn’t done her research, and we ended up in an extremely conservative town. No one’s been that fond of us since we got here. Even though we’re Christian like them, they side-eye us, especially my mom. She hasn’t told anyone the circumstances of how she ended up as a young, single mother, but even if she did, they would still blame her. After all, they blamed the last teenager who got knocked up by a youth pastor. He still works at the church, blessed with the town’s forgiveness, while the girl left town as soon as she became of age, cast out by her own family. To this day, my mom refuses to let him anywhere near me.

Yesterday should’ve been just a normal Sunday. Most of the town attended the morning service, which went as it usually did. It wasn’t until we exited the church that a little girl named Veronica Eldridge screamed and collapsed to the ground, limbs flailing. At first, everyone thought she was having a seizure, but, to our horror, her leg lifted and dragged her upwards as if a rope was pulling her up. But there was no rope. Just a little girl floating in mid-air and screaming. It shouldn’t have been possible, but we were all seeing it. But that wasn’t the biggest shock.

Veronica managed to steady her arm and pointed at someone. “PLEASE STOP!!! PLEASE!!!”

Everyone turned to look at the person she was accusing. I did, too, but I didn’t have to look far. My mom turned pale as she realized what was happening. Veronica was still screaming, but my mom tried to shout that it wasn’t her. I knew it couldn’t be her, but I also knew that no one would believe her. She grabbed my arm and tried to get us to leave, but several of the men surrounded us and wrenched us away from each other. Now three of us were screaming because I was begging them to let my mom go and that she was innocent. They wouldn’t listen as they dragged my mom away from the church entrance.

Someone must’ve called 911 because the sound of sirens were approaching. A police car and an ambulance pulled up in front of the church. The responders exited their vehicles and were momentarily shocked by the scene they were witnessing. The cops were brought back to reality when the men restraining my mom dragged her to the police car, yelling that she was a witch and possessing Veronica. One of them, a woman, seemed a little skeptical, but the male cop seem to have no qualms about arresting my mom. I ran over them, begging them not to take her away, ignoring the paramedics who rushed past me to see if they could do anything to help Veronica. The woman looked hesitantly at her partner, who shrugged. An arrest had to be made. He sat my mom in the backseat, both cops got in the car, then they drove off while I stood there, watching helplessly. Behind me, I could hear Veronica’s screams subsiding and turned to see that she was slowly descending to the ground. As soon as she was lying down on the ground, again, the paramedics moved in and transferred her to a stretcher. From what I could hear, it sounded like they were going to take her to the hospital to ensure she was okay.

I know *I’m* not okay. As of now, I’m in the courthouse waiting for my foster placement hearing. They tried to contact my biological father, but I informed them of the active restraining order. With no other known relatives in contact, they had no choice but to declare me a ward of the state while my mom waited for due process. I don’t know what’s going to happen, nor do I understand what’s going on. History claims that the Salem Witch Trials from over three hundred years ago were just girls making up stories, likely under their fathers’ influence. This wasn’t a made-up story, though. You can pretend to see stuff and feel pain all you want, but no one can fake being pulled up into the air by nothing. If there’s a witch in this town, then maybe we’re all in danger. But it’s not my mom. It can’t be my mom.

Whoever is the real witch is framing her.
