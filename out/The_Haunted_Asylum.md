 

The old, abandoned asylum on the edge of town had always been a source of fear for the locals. The building had stood empty for decades, ever since the patients and staff disappeared without a trace.

But one day, a group of teenagers decided to sneak into the asylum to see what was inside. They made their way through the dark corridors, their flashlights illuminating the peeling paint and cobwebs that covered everything.

As they explored deeper into the building, they heard strange sounds coming from the walls. The rustling of papers and the scraping of metal against concrete. But when they looked closer, they couldn't find the source of the noise.

The air grew colder as they made their way to the basement. The stairs creaked beneath their feet, and the flickering lights cast eerie shadows on the walls. But when they reached the bottom, they found something that made their blood run cold.

There was a room at the end of the corridor that was unlike any other in the building. The walls were covered in strange symbols, and the air was thick with the smell of decay. And in the center of the room, there was a figure that seemed to be made of shadows.

The figure didn't move or speak, but the teenagers knew it was watching them. They tried to run, but the doors wouldn't budge. The figure slowly began to move toward them, its form growing larger and more terrifying with each passing second.

The teenagers screamed as the figure engulfed them in darkness. When the authorities finally found their bodies, they were twisted and contorted into unnatural positions, with looks of terror frozen on their faces.

To this day, the haunted asylum remains empty, and no one dares to venture inside. But sometimes, on a quiet night, the residents of the nearby town claim they can still hear the sound of screams coming from the building.  


 As they reached the edge of the forest, they saw a small cabin in the distance, barely visible through the dense fog. They had no other choice but to approach the cabin and seek refuge.

As they got closer, they could see that the cabin was old and run-down. The windows were boarded up, and the door was barely hanging on its hinges. They hesitated for a moment before knocking on the door, but no one answered.

They decided to enter anyway and were immediately hit by the smell of mildew and rot. The inside of the cabin was dark and musty, and the only light came from the flickering candles that lined the walls.

As they made their way further into the cabin, they could feel a sense of unease growing within them. They could hear strange noises coming from the shadows, and every creak of the old wooden floors made their hearts skip a beat.

As they turned a corner, they saw a figure standing in the shadows. It was a tall, gaunt man with sunken eyes and a crooked smile. He was staring at them with a hunger in his eyes, as if he was sizing them up for something.

They tried to run, but their legs wouldn't move. It was as if the figure had some sort of power over them. As he drew closer, they could see that he was covered in a thick layer of mold and rotting flesh. The stench was overwhelming, and they could feel their stomachs turn.

He spoke to them in a low, raspy voice, and his words seemed to echo through the cabin. He told them that they had stumbled upon his home, and that they were now his prisoners. He told them that he would use them for his dark rituals, and that he would feast upon their souls.

As he reached out to grab them, they managed to break free of his spell and run out of the cabin. They didn't stop running until they were far away from that cursed place.

They never spoke of that night again, but the memory of the ghostly figure in the cabin haunted them for the rest of their lives. They knew that they had narrowly escaped a fate worse than death, and that they would never forget the horror that they had experienced.
