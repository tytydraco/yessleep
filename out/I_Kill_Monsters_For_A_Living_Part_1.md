I always feel excited in the woods at night. There’s something suspenseful about shadows dancing in the corner of my eye, possible danger everywhere. 

Tonight is different. As I slowly step over logs and push aside branches I feel a sense of heightened anxiety. Maybe knowing what I’m tracking is evoking this feeling, maybe it’s the fact that I haven’t heard a single animal noise in hours. Probably both. 

There’s rustling in the bushes ahead of me, I reach for the silver machete attached to my belt. I hear a low growl and hold the weapon defensively. 

I know what I need to do, I reach for the bait attached to my belt. It’s attracted the predator better than I had hoped. I wave the blood soaked pillow case of raw meat in front of me, back and forth. 

“Come and get it, mother fucker.”

It lunges fast, but I’m faster. Stabbing it in the chest is easy, avoiding getting bitten in the process is another story. Finally I’m standing over the carcass, panting and sweaty. 

It has a wolf like head but humanistic hands with large claws. The whole body seems to be covered in hair and fur. 

I feel guilt for the human inside the beast, there’s no way of knowing if they had been aware of their affliction. I wonder how many they’ve killed while transformed, justifying myself with the thought that I’ve possibly saved lives. 

Time to get down to business, I get to work on the body. After removing the fangs, claws, and organs I place a tracker in its mouth. I start the long trek out of the woods. 

I get on my radio. - TARGET ACQUIRED, PACKAGE IN HAND. DISPOSAL TEAM CLEARED FOR GO. -

I hear the military choppers fly overhead on my way out, by the time the disposal team’s job is done there will be no trace of the werewolf. 

Back at the Bureau I hand the organ box to a nerdy guy in a lab coat. He seems nervous to be around me, which makes sense as I’m covered in blood. 

“I’m gonna have to check the organs for damage before you leave.”

I nod, this isn’t my first rodeo. 

On the drive home I chuckle at the thought of getting pulled over. What would a cop make of my bloody appearance? I’d have to flash my special little badge to get out of it. 

It’s a pretty night, the full moon illuminates green fields and woods on the way to my town. 

I’m exhausted, it took months to track that werewolf. Months of watching and waiting for the right lunar cycle. Then there was the actual hunt through the friggin’ woods. 

I stop the car to make a phone call. I have a special phone for calls of this sort, untapped and untraceable. 

“Hey Sally. I’ve got a set of werewolf fangs and claws. Any interested parties?”

“I got a gal in Los Angeles who will pay a pretty penny for the claws. I’m interested in the fangs myself if you’re looking to trade.”

“I’ll be at the Market tomorrow.”
