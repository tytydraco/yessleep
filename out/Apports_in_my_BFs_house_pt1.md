Hi. I decided to post this here after scouring the web for similar experiences. 

I have been living with my boyfriend for over a year now. Prior to meeting me, he lived alone for 5 years. He has had some unexplainable things happen in the apartment.

His Dog is a large German shepherd and akita mix with a calm temperament. The dog rarely barks, I have gone months without hearing a single bark. He only whines when he sees other dogs.

In the hallway leading up to the bedrooms, I noticed that the dog is too scared to turn around in the hall - so he walks backwards, very slowly. 
Honestly, I don't know if it's because he's too large to turn comfortably or he's scared of something. I've seen him turn around a few times, but he hastily runs out of the hall not like his slow walk backwards.

In that same hall, my boyfriend and I have seen a shadow on the wall in the shape of a small man - like puppet size. And this was during midday, and there is nothing in the house that can make that shape. Nothing had been moved, so there was no possible source of the shadow.

The dog sometimes actively shows fear of a presence. There are videos we have taken of him where it seemed like an invisible force is stopping him from walking through the doorframe of rooms around the house. He would whine and try to take a step across the threshold, but then step back while looking worried and sniffing the air. 
Mind you, this dog is a calm soul and very sensitive to emotions - he can tell if my bf and I are angry, sad or upset. And he is very expressive.

Everytime it happens, you can see on his face that he is terrified. 
There was a time where it happened when he was already in the room, one minute he was laying there calmly and the next he bolted up and ran out the room - looking in across the doorframe and whining. 
It has also happened when I tried to walk him, he usually bolts down the stairs and through the door, but this time he just stood on the landing while looking outside the open door and whining.

Aside from the occurrences with the dog, my BF mentioned that prior to meeting me when he had is brother, cousin, and son over on separate days, they all saw a shadowy figure watching them from his library, hallway, or stairwell (all three are in full view from the couch where they would sleep). 
They all thought it was my BF playing a joke on them, till they called out and my BF would come out from another side of the house and the shadow would dissappear.

Before my BF was alone for 5 years, he dated a lady who had a son from a previous relationship. 
One night the mom and son slept in the guest room and him in the main room. He woke up to a shadow of the child walking in the direction of the bathroom, 15 seconds later another figure walks in the direction of the bathroom. 
In shock, he leaps out of the bed and grips the child by the shoulders startling him and waking the mother. This obviously led to an argument.
 
There was a time when my BF found pale finger prints on a black flask that wasn't capable of fingerprint transfer. The prints disappeared shortly after. He lived alone then and has photos of the flask.

OK.. that is just the start. Things have disappeared and sometimes things have appeared - hence the apports.
Both categories have caused arguments and mental distress.
In the first months of meeting my BF, we were going through momentos of his and we found an envelope with USD cash. He said he withdrew it for his trip to Mexico but forgot it or couldn't find it. He counted it - $500, and then put it back. 
I went back to my place, and his son visited him. Somehow, he also showed his son the money but did not count it. He left his son alone at home briefly, and when he returned the boy was in the shower. He decided to count the money - $420. Odd. 
He confronted his son and he denied it. The next day he confronted me, of course I denied it because I DID NOT DO IT. 
Because of this, the relationship started with a bit of distrust. And I believe his son too, after meeting with him I doubt he'd lie to his dad who is willing to give him things when he asks.

One night my BF got up to grab a drink of Gatorade, it was too cold so he left it on the counter. In the morning, the bottle was empty and he thought it was me. BUT I WAS ASLEEP THE WHOLE TIME. He thought I was lying, but why would I - I don't even like Gatorade.
 
Okay.. so that's it for the things that have disappeared.
