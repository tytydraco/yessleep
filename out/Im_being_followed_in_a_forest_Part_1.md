My entire childhood, I lived in a beautiful town called Rachovtsi in Bulgaria. I spent countless days, sitting in the bright sun enjoying pancakes that my grandmother made for me. Or when my friends came over, it was always so exciting. That's because my town is a "selo". A selo is a very, very small town that has about 100-500 people living in it. Everyone knows eachother there. My friends lived in Tryavna, a big city that's about a 1 hour walking distance from Rachovtsi. I go to school there since there's no school in my city.  Anyways, 20 years ago, I decided I want to go there, to see how my childhood town is now. To my suprise, I found the town abandoned. I arrived there, with nature taking back the city. Locals called it "The lost selo". That's also why I had a hard time finding it, I spent about a month just looking for it since it's nowhere to be seen on GPS. We wen't there on 12.08.2002.

When I arrived there it was about 8 PM. I was with a few friends, we decided we were going to camp there before going there. When I walked on the main street, which is now just grass and a few rocks in between, I became very touched by the fact that my childhood town is gone. All of the houses, barely any left standing. We decided to set up our tent right infront of my childhood house, and we went inside. It's actually one of the very few houses still standing. It's a dead town. Nobody's there, no animals are there, no electricity, nothing.  Inside there was lot's of junking of people coming inside an vandalising stuff. All of my possesions were gone. Now it's about 9 PM, it's getting dark. We're still walking and exploring the town. We we're walking to the furthest "sink" - if you can call it that - and the rocky path with grass inbetween it only goes up to that sink. We could still see the symbols. Now, it's pretty dark so it's time to head back to our tent. While going there we went past a blue house. Only the front part of the house was still standing. Exactly then, we say a big candle lit in the window of the house.  We could see it very clearly in the night. We all had one thing on our mind then: "RUN". We were so scared of the candle we sprinted to our tent. What the fuck? A candle lit, in an abonded town, with no civilaztion around for around 20 miles. Something is there. We gathered all of our bravery and went to sleep.

The next day, we were so confused. We spent atleast an hour talking and thinking what that could've been. We decided it would be wise to go back and see if it was still there. Now reflecting on that choice, it was the stupidest thing ever.  It took atleast an hour to just get to the house from our tent. The grass and all of the trees and bushes, it's so dense that it took us so long to just walk 50 meters.And, there's nothing there. No candle, and not even a sign that anyone could've been here and even no marks of the candle. There's just no fucking way. Nobody in their right mind would do this in the night. There's just simply no way. We decided it was best that we went home, just in case.

10 years later, 12.08.2012.  I decide to go back there. Why? I don't know.  We wen't with three people: Me, my friend, and a person that's appearantly extra sensetive to paranormal things. It's 9 pm, so we went there. And what happend, is absurd. We went by all sorts of things, random 1 meter deep holes, random door frames in the middle of the path, who knows what happend here. But something was not right. The whole time, we were stopping and going: "SHHH!" It's like someone was walking behind us. But there's nobody to be seen, not even an animal. It happened again, and again, while we were explaining our story here to the girl. We arrived by the house. It's a blue house, which signifies richness. In the balkans, only the rich people we're able to have a blue color on their house. Not that it's pretty or anything, but that doesn't matter. I actually remember who lived here, it's a man named Ivan. Sweet guy, but didn't really know him much more. We wen't trough the bushes and arrived at the front of the house. 

Immediatly after arriving, we heard a strange sound. A very short bass kind of sound. It stops, and it goes, for about 2 seconds. After a minute it stopped. We're all standing there like what the hell just happend? We eventually decided that it may be some kind of night wedding. It's pretty common in Bulgaria, but still, we are not sure and still very skeptical. We turned on K2 meters, but nothing. A camera that can detect warmth, that also didn't show much results altough there were some strange cold spots in the forest around the house. While we were there we were also recording the whole time. Temperatures dropped like crazy. Like 10 degrees Celcius/50 fahrenheit in 30 minutes. Which was strangely similar to our previous experience there. But then, as a last resort we tried to turn on a night camera. It uses infrared light to see in the dark. If you don't know, it's a flashlight that only infrared cameras can see and the human eye can't see anything of the light. Then, on the night camera, there was a bright flash. 

A bright flash standing right infront of my friend. An infrared flash in the middle of the forest? From what I could see, it was about 10-20 meters/ 35-65 feet away. I immediatly called my friend" Dude, look in front of you do you see anything??" I said that with a very scared voice. My friend is like: "No what do you mean?". "There's a bright flash right in front of you on the night camera." I said. My friend stands there in shock trying to locate a source of light/ to see anything of movement in front of him. While the girl and I are trying to see if it's some glitch or something. It's not. We can't see anything. It's almost 10 PM. My friend ran to me and saw the flash on the camera's preview monitor. Then, it turned off. We all got so fucking scared, that we started to run out of there untill we're back on the main road while still looking at the night camera. It's nowhere to be found. When we're on the main path, we try to catch our breath, and suddenly, it appears again, right behind us. This time, it's way less bright, and fading in and out and moving very little. Not towards us, but you know kind of like the movement like left and right with your arms. We tried throwing things at it, and it turned off. We we're now backing away and it turned back on and kinda started following us. Nothing is visible on the main camera and we also don't see anything with our eyes. We all had the same question: Who is there in the middle of the night, trying to get a good look at us with an infrared camera?
