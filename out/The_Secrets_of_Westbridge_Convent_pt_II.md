By the time I was fifteen, my experience in the woods wasn't much more than a fading memory. For me, life returned to normal. I was attending highschool and most of my time was spent focusing on keeping grades up and hanging out with my new friend group, of which Adam wasn’t really a part of. There wasn’t any particular reason for this. We just kind of grew apart as we matured. The only time I ever remember actually arguing with him was over the woods. I swore I would never return after what happened when we were ten, but he was adamant about trying to find what we encountered, or rather, what I had encountered all those years ago. Adam never actually saw the thing. He ran away far before it ever reached the tree. For him, it was still a legend, for me, a nightmare that was all too real. 

It was in the late winter of my sophomore year when my mom made me go down to the church to ask the new pastor if there was anything he needed help with. His name was Father Christopher Burke. At the time, he must have been in his mid twenties, though he looked much older. He had small, rounded glasses, a gaunt and permanently melancholy expression, as well as thick, black hair that was often slicked back, unless he decided to wear it short. When he became the new priest of our parish, Adam and I jokingly referred to him as nosferatu. Most of the younger children were scared of him, though he was never malicious towards anyone. At most, Father Christopher was a bit cold and poor at conversation, but he always valued his manners.

 I was able to catch Father Christopher just as he was walking between the church and the priory. 

When I asked him if he needed help with anything, he acted rather dismissively, as per usual. 

“I suppose you could…. vacuum some of the old rugs that will go towards the Parish tag sale. They're down in the cafeteria. Just… stay in the main room, I've recently seen that some parts of the lower floor contain asbestos. You don’t want to breathe that stuff in. ”

I made my way down to the old cafeteria, with the staircase letting out a loud creak with each step I took. I always hated it down there, especially now that I was completely alone. The tiled ceiling was lined with bright, fluorescent lights, the kind that made a gentle humming noise when turned on. They illuminated the groupings of folding chairs and plastic tables that were usually neglected for months. What the lights did not reach were the various doorways and halls that branched off into separate parts of the church. I tried not to focus on those, but there was something very unnerving about the dark corners and rooms of this building. The whole cafeteria felt hostile and I just wanted to leave as soon as possible. I found the old rugs Father Christopher spoke of. They were placed next to the janitorial closet. I went in there to grab the vacuum, and cleaned the rugs as quickly as I could, occasionally glancing over my shoulders at the pitch-black corridors. 

After putting the vacuum back in the janitorial closet, I shut off the lights and headed for the door, feeling afraid of what could have been in the shadows behind me. However, for some inexplicable reason, I stopped myself. Maybe it was because I was specifically told not to go into any of the other rooms, or maybe because of a curiosity that is natural to the human spirit, but for whatever reason, I turned around. Looking back, I saw a doorway just across from the Janitorial closet. From the little light that reached the inside of the room, there could be seen various, vague shapes and forms that captured the imagination. I made my way to the room and found the light switch. The whole space was illuminated by a single yellow, flickering bulb that shown light on the various clothes, bags, and furniture that packed the tiny room. None of it was particularly interesting, but I did come across a single cabinet that drew me in by the same force I experienced when trying to leave. I opened the door slowly, letting the dim light of the room reveal what was inside.

 It looked like a doll, but that's not a very accurate description, as it was much too ornate to be a toy. It resembled a womanly figure wearing a dress, and it was made entirely out of hay, red ribbons, and various dried flowers. That is, all but the head of the figure was made of these natural materials. The head itself was bronze, or maybe even gold, that was lined with an array of gemstones and carvings which were either  just decorative, or a language that I was wholly unfamiliar with. The head piece was made in the shape of the sun, with a round middle section and eight rays branching off from the middle piece. In the very center of the whole thing was a small feminine face. Nothing about the face itself was particularly complex or even well crafted. It was crudely made but something about it greatly intrigued me. When I focused my attention on her simple, calm eyes, I felt a sensation on the back of my scalp that grew in intensity the longer I stared. I lack the words to fully explain my emotions, but it felt wrong to look at. Below the figurine was a small, tattered piece of yellow paper that was partially burned. On it, there was cursive writing that read:

*Agrina, Agrina*

*Our light* 

*Our Mother*

*Our purest joy* 

*The heavens are thy domain* 

*Thy light will shine and heal*

*The lowly from their earthly pain* 

*O, Agrina, Agrina* 

*Keep us in thy heart* 

*When you take back thy throne*

*And from the earth depart*

I have never forgotten those words. They perplexed me; drew me in as though it was a powerful incantation. I had never heard of such a name as *Agrina*, and though it sounded like a prayer or poem, it was entirely unfamiliar to me. Just as I was re-reading the strange text, I heard something which almost made me jump through the low bearing roof. 

“Lucas?” Father Christopher muttered. “I told you not to go into the separate rooms.”

At first I was relieved to see him, but the panicked look on Father Christopher's face made me quickly unsettled again. I had never seen him in this way. The dim yellow light only accented his pale skin, sunken eyes, and sullen expression. With his black garment, he loomed in the small doorway, and for the first time, I was afraid of him. 

“Sorry.” I responded sharply while putting back the strange paper and figurine. “I thought there was another rug in here that I was supposed to vacuum.” 

Father Christopher said nothing for a moment, darting his eyes first to the figurine, and then back to me. 

“It's ok. I just don't want anyone getting hurt. I’ll let you know if I need anything else, ok?” 

“R…Right,” I responded. “I’ll see you Sunday.” 

“Goodbye Lucas. Have a nice night.” 

I darted out of there as soon as Father Christopher stepped out of the doorway. I tried to forget that evening but it was just too strange to ignore. I decided to consult Adam, figuring that he might be the only one to understand why that disturbed me so much, and I was right. The whole time I was recounting the story to him, Adam was enthralled by every last detail, remaining perfectly silent until the very end.

“Do you think this has something to do with that thing in the woods?” He finally spoke.

“What? No. That *thing* in the woods was probably just a mountain lion, or bear at worst.” I didn’t really believe that was the case, but the thought made me feel better.

“Well I think there’s a connection, and Count Christopher probably knows what it is. I didn’t trust the guy since the moment I laid eyes on him. He’s shady as all hell. Just last week, I was asking him if he needed help moving stuff out of the old convent and-”

“What convent?” I interjected.

“You don’t know? Figures. Pretty much no one in this town knows about it but my family. It's about 4 miles from the Parish, just rotting somewhere off in the woods. It's small and there haven’t been any nuns there in about oh….30 years? It was Father Christopher who finally decided it was time to get rid of the place. I assumed he wanted to sell the land, but now I’m not so sure. When I asked him if he needed help moving all the old stuff out. He shot me down right away. He said the old lead paint was dangerous to be around. Don’t you find that weird? One guy cleaning out an entire Convent by himself? I’m telling you, there's something there that old Father Christopher is hiding.”

“ I can see how that connects to the weird doll, but what does this have to do with the thing in the woods?”

“I never told you this because I didn’t think it was relevant, but on that night, when you told me to start running, I did so for about three minutes until I came across a large, dilapidated house. It freaked the hell out of me so I just ran in a different direction. Now I realize that whatever you heard running through the woods that night, was roaming right next to the old convent.”

“I knew what Adam was going to suggest, but I didn’t like it. I hated reliving the memory of that terrible night near Burlock. I hated the idea of trespassing onto lands we were never meant to step foot on, but most of all, I hated the fact that there was no way I would sleep at night, unless I figured out what was going on. Two days after this conversation. Adam and I took our bikes, and headed for the old convent.
