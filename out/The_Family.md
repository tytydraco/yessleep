I am a 23 year old father of 2. We are living in a house in a small forest. It's a 15 minute drive to the city.

My wife and i always wanted to live peaceful without many other people. After this our view on that changed.

My 12 year old daughter, Laura was always a smart kid. She didn't talk to us that often, except when we ate dinner. She always liked music, still does. My 5 year old son Max is a really curious guy, when he hears something he isn't scared but goes looking for what made the noise.

Both go to school which is only 18 Minutes away from the house. My wife mostly brings Laura to school but i bring Max.

One day our normal, simple life changed for the worse. When i brought Max to school he asked me if his uncle can bring him to school. I looked at him and asked him what uncle he meant. He told me he doesn't know his name.

I responded, Max you don't have an uncle. He told me that he had. I asked him where he saw him. He looked at me not knowing why i asked so many questions.

He said, he taps on my window every night, i let him in, he tells me a goodnight story and leaves to the hallway. I stared at him in shock.

While a man breaking in our house in the night is bad, the thing that was even worse was, his room was on the 2nd floor.

What does he look like? I asked after i looked at him for a minute. He told me that he has long legs and arms, a crooked neck and his mouth is gaping open.

My eyes widened, Max why did you think that was your uncle? I quickly said okay don't answer Max. 

After i picked him up from school i decided to install a camera in his room and the hallway. I tried to stay awake but i was just too tired to move.

The next day i ran to my phone to check the camera feed, nothing the whole night except my son opening the window and the door opening by itself. I thought that this thing is just out of our control but to prove it existed i stayed up all night.

I didn't see him. But in the morning Max asked me if i saw his Uncle because he didn't let him out last night.

I ran to my wife which was drinking her coffee and my daughter who was reading. I told them to get out of the house and in the car.

They both looked at me and my wife asked me why. I told them to just run and don't ask questions.

I was just about to start the car when my son ran in the house to get something. I sprinted to him but he was already in the house.

It suddenly was extremely quiet. I shouted for my son but i didn't see him i walked everywhere and looked for him and suddenly i heard something behind me.

My son, i slowly walked up to him and told him to come outside. When suddenly a really long arm snatched my son.

My only thought in that moment was to run outside. I ran to the car when my wife asked me where our son was.

This moment traumatized me. The "Uncle" stepped outside and waved at us. This wasn't traumatizing. The problem was he had our sons face. Not facial features but his skin.

I drove off not looking back comforting my wife and daughter that just saw the most disturbing thing there is.

I need to throw up even when i think about it. 

I am writing this now 2 years later and i still hear the tapping.

We now live in a house with 18 stories, we're at the top. What should i do?
