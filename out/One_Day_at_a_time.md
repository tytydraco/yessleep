Max hadn’t seen a single drink in 17 days. A personal record. His last bender had ended in disaster: broken glass, vomit on the carpet, his ex-girlfriend screaming over the phone about the endless phonecalls. This time, he had promised himself he would stay sober. 

The intrusive thoughts were bad, but the cravings were hell. Every morning, he lay in bed, shaking, all day he sat at his desk, shaking, at night, he lay in bed, shaking. And then there was the knocking.

It all started four nights ago. It started quiet at first, just a single, soft knock on the door of flat 4b. When he got out of bed to check, no one was there. 

Strange. You normally need to be buzzed in to get to any of the front doors. Has 3b long-hair left the latch unlocked again? Maybe 4a fish-smell? 5c hot blonde? 

On the second night, it grew louder. More frequent. Max dared not go to the door, paranoia was kicking in. Was this some sort of auditiory hallucination? Some part of the withdrawals that Sandra, his AA sponsor had warned him about? 

By the third night, it had grown even louder. The dull rapping echoed through the empty hallway, rattling Max’s nerves. He stayed up all night waiting for the door to swing open. Or waiting for it to stop and to find some release. He clutched the only thing that gave him any iota of strength - a coin from his AA sponsor, stamped with the serenity prayer and the words ‘One Day at a Time’. It had been her’s from when she had reached 10 years of sobriety.

Now it was the fourth night, and he couldn’t stop thinking about how much easier this would all be if he just had a drink. 

***…***

The knocking started at midnight. As it had every night. 

Max sat in his darkened living room, staring down the hallway at the locked, latched door. It came again, louder still - three definite knocks. 

“Who’s there?” Max’s voice cracked as his words echoed through the room. His throat tightened as the words left him. It was a stupid question—no one would answer. No one ever did.

He tried to ignore it once again, twirling his AA coin around his fingers, feeling the intricate embossings on the sterling piece. The sound grew louder and louder, the knocking became more impatient as the minutes rolled on - or had it been hours?

Max checked his phone.

***1:07am***

The sound hadn’t stopped for an entire hour. The knocks hammered against the door like an urgent heartbeat, each blow vibrating through the floor and sending tremors up Max’s spine. He clutched his head, squeezing his eyes shut, but the sound burrowed into his skull, relentless and inescapable.

Finally Max decided enough was enough. He grabbed his coin firmly in his left hand used his right to yank the door open, expecting to find some sort of prankster, or one of the many strange exhibitions of humans in the freak show that was his flat complex. 

No one was there.

He shut the door, heart racing. He stood behind the closed door for a minute or two, expecting the furious knocks to begin again. 

Silence. 

This confirmed it, it had to be a hallucination. 

As Max turned away from the door, a strange chill crept up his neck— the air had shifted. He shook his head, dismissing the thought. It was just the withdrawals messing with his head. Wasn’t it?

Max trod carefully through the flat. He could finally get some sleep. He entered his lounge, ready to switch off the lamp and get some rest, when his eyes picked up on a foreign object that hadn’t been there before. 

A bottle of whiskey sat unopened on his coffee table, next to an engraved trumbler his late mother had bought as an 18th birthday present. 

Max froze, his blood ran cold and he felt every individual hair stand up along his arms and neck. The bottle gleamed under the lamplight, the amber liquid inside glinting like a cruel invitation. Max’s head became overwhelmed with memories floding back: the warmth of the first sip, the sweet sting as it hit his throat, the way it silenced the chaos. His fingers twitched. He felt them aching, itching to unscrew the cap, but his mind screamed warnings. He had poured every bottle down the drain last month. How the hell was this one here?

“I threw you all out,” he muttered.

He grabbed the bottle, intending to pour it down the sink, but the moment he touched it, it felt as though it touched him back. A sudden freezing sensation shot through his arm.

“Drink.”

Max’s head jerked around, but the room was empty. He tried to release the bottle, but his hands were viced around it, unmoving. 

“No,” He muttered, his voice faltering. “I won’t”.

The bottle grew heavier in his hands. A low, guttural laughter echoed across the room. 

“You’ve already let me in,” the voice rumbled. “Why fight it now?”

“Fuck you!” Max screamed. He hurled the bottle with every ounce of defiance he had left. It shattered, the whiskey spilling like blood across the floor. The voice let out an ear-piercing howl, shaking the foundations of the flat. 

Max staggered back, cluthing the sides of his head as the walls seemed to start to pulse. He stumbled his way to the bathroom, readying himself to vomit. Just as he reached the bathroom sink, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. All of his pain was gone within an instant.

His reflection wasn’t his own.

The figure in the glass staring back at him was thinner, greyer and gaunt, with hollow holes where cheeks should be and black eyes. It’s mouth slowly stretched open into a wide smile. 

“You can never outrun me. I’m in every reflection you see, I’m every drink you crave, every moment of weakness. I will always be here.” it whispered.

Max staggered back, but his body didn’t move. His reflection refused to release him. The mimic stayed where it was, staring at him from the mirror as he screamed. 

“Go ahead,” it hissed at him. “Run, pray, pretend you’re stronger than me, but we both know it’s only a matter of time.”

***…***

The next morning, Sandra arrived at her usual time to check on Max. Her knock was unanswered. “As per fucking usual” She laughed to herself. She knocked once more, slightly heavier this time, but her fist pushed the door open. 

Sandra slowly cased the flat for any sign of Max. Nothing. Then she reached the bathroom. Inside she found Max curled up in the corner of the room, pale-faced, cluthing the coin she had gifted to him. 

“Max?” She whispered, crouching down beside him. 

He looked up, his eyes dark and bloodshot. 

“It doesn’t stop,” He said, his voice echoing defeat. “It’s always there, waiting for me to fuck up.”

Sandra wrapped her arms around him. “One day at a time, Max. We’ll face it, Max. Together. One fight, one breath, one day at a time”

She helped him up onto his feet, and guided him out of the bathroom, but as she started to leave, her gaze flicked to the mirror. For the briefest moment, she saw it - the twisted reflection staring back at her, it’s grin was razor sharp, its eyes widening. But it wasn’t Max’s, it was hers. 

It winked.

Sandra’s breath hitched. She took a step back, blinking hard, but the twisted grin lingered in the mirror—her grin. Her hand trembled as she turned away, her chest tight with a familiar, suffocating ache.

“Come on,” she whispered, her voice steady despite the chill in her chest. “Let’s get through today.”
