Yesterday afternoon, my car started refused to start the engine, so I had to call my mechanic. He said some pieces were missing, and he took the car with his tow-truck for fixing in his workshop. Welp, that’s not pleasant, but shit happens, I guess. I called an uber and went to work. After my shift was over, around 8PM, I needed to go back home. Unfortunately, I had forgotten my phone in the uber that took me to work, so I had to ask one of my colleagues to call an uber for me. I went to the street outside and waited. After a few minutes, a car showed up. 


“Good evening. What’s your name again, just for confirmation?” 

 
“It was my colleague Christine who called. I forgot my phone at home.” 

 
“Right. The address is on St. Peter St., right?” 

 
“No, I think she put the wrong address. Can you leave me on Red Oak St. 34?” 

 
“Is it close to St. Peter St.?”  

 
“I think so.” I didn't know where St. Peter Street was, but I’m terrible with names of streets, so I assumed my colleague dragged the marker to the wrong street. I didn’t have my phone, but luckily, I still had my tablet with me, so I got it and went back to some reports I had to finish for 
work. 


After around half an hour or so, which is the time it normally takes to get to my address, I looked away from the tablet, and I noticed something. The place we were driving through seemed to be nowhere near my home.  


“Excuse me, mister, but where are we going?” I asked. He didn’t answer. I waited for a few seconds and asked again. “Sir, I think you are taking the wrong way...” I finally recognized the street we were on. It was one of the poorest and most crime-ridden parts of the city.  

 
“Red Blood Street, 34. As you asked.” There was something wrong with his tone of voice. 

 
“I said Red Oak, not Red Blood.”  
 

“I am deeply sorry, mistress!” He shouted angrily, as he made a sudden sharp U-turn, almost crashing the car into a van that was coming from the opposite direction. 
 

“Hey, what the hell was that?” I asked, making sure my seatbelt was still on. I contemplated jumping out of the car, but one look at the street full of trash and wandering drug addicted people made me give up on that.  

 
“You think my driving’s bad ma’am, feel free to leave a one-star review or jump out. Otherwise, you can shut the fuck up and let me do my job.” He said, in a mocking tone. I stared at him in disbelief. That’s when I noticed something. He was using no cellphone or GPS. And I didn’t see him using any of them at any point during the ride. My heart began to race, and I could feel cold sweat falling on my forehead. I looked outside again. Some meters away, below an overpass, I could see three men kicking what appeared to be a homeless man, and one of them had a baseball bat. Maybe that rude driver was not that bad after all?   
 

That’s when I noticed he was still not going to my address. The path he was taking led to outside of town, to the countryside.  
 

“Sir, you can drop me here.” I said. Better losing my tablet than going wherever he was taking me. 
 

“I can’t drop you here, this region is too dangerous. I’ll let you go when we reach our destination.”  
 

This whole thing already had more red flags than a communist parade during the Soviet Union. I immediately opened my handbag, searching for my pepper spray, thinking that if he attempted anything I would be ready. But my pepper spray was also not there. Had I forgotten it too? 
 

“Please sir, please, let me go.” I pleaded. He didn’t say anything. I saw that he was lowering the speed, we were coming close to a crossroad. That was my chance. I gripped my handbag firmly and opened the door handle. But the door didn’t move.  
 

“Child locks. Can’t have my passengers hurting themselves, am I right?” He whispered, as he went past the crossroad and started picking up the speed again.  
 

“Where are you taking me?” I contemplated attacking him. But he was too strong, and too fast, and way above the speed limit. If he crashed, there was a high chance of me dying. 
 

“I already told you. Blood street.” He grinned.  
 

“Mister... I... I can give you money. Even my tablet. Just let me go. I beg you.”  
 

“I don’t want your money, Danielle.”  

 
“Wait... How do you know my name?”  


“Because you are stupid. Stupid as fuck. Danielle, who took you to work today?” I didn’t remember. I couldn’t even remember the model of the car.  
 

“It was me. You forgot your phone here.”  
 

“So you have my phone with you?” 
 

“Yes. We are going to my home to get it. And maybe I will return it to you. But I need my payment first.” I felt shivers going down my spine. I tried to lower the window, but it was also locked. Maybe if I broke it and jumped? I tried opening the door once again, even if I knew it wouldn’t work. 
 

“Danielle, you already tried that. Tried the same thing over and over is the definition of insanity. We are almost getting to our destination. Calm down.” He whispered. The car was now entering a side road and getting away from the highway.  
 

“Please.” I started crying. I heard him trying to suppress his laughter. 
 

“Calm down, Danielle. We haven’t even started.” He giggled. We were approaching a gas station. There were no cars around, but maybe if I managed to get out and ask the convenience store clerk for help? He started lowering the car speed. “Now, ma’am, I will go to the toilet for two minutes so I can take a piss. Don’t even think of trying anything, ok? You won’t like what happens next.” He parked the car, exited, and circled to the back of the gas station. I was frozen. I was terrified of what he would do if I went for help, but I was also terrified of him taking me for whatever his “payment” was. I gathered my courage and threw myself on the driver’s seat, opened the door, and exited the car so fast I fell to the floor. But I had no time to think. I picked myself up and ran inside the station.  
 

“Sir, please, you gotta help me! This man, he has kidnapped me, please, call the police!” I begged the gas station clerk, crying and gasping for air. He was a skinny teenager, 17 at maximum. He seemed as scared as I was. 

 
“What? Ok, I’m calling them, just a minute!” He said, his face growing pale as he grabbed the store phone and dialed 911. I looked back at the car, the door still open. At any moment, that sick bastard would be back. I went around the store, looking for any weapon or anything that could be used as a weapon. I found a broom. Probably useless, but better than nothing. 
 

“Hello, I have an emergency, the gas station in Xander Road, 19. Yes, yes. There’s a woman in state of shock here... She says she was kidnapped or something... Could you send someone... Hello? Hello?” The cashier looked in horror to the phone. “It stopped working.” 
 

“Use your phone!” 

 
“T-there’s n-no signal here. I c-can’t.” He was visibly trembling. I heard the door of the convenience store opening. My captor was back, and he had a horrible smile on his face. On his hands, he had a large knife and gloves.  
 

“I knew you were going to do this. You gals always, always do.” He laughed, coming in my direction. I backed against the wall, unsure of what to do.  
 

“S-sir, I’m g-gonna have to a-ask y-you to l-leave the station! The p-police is on the w-way!” The boy asked, quickly stepping in front of the man. He was half the size of the predator.  
 

“You are even dumber than her.” The driver whispered, caressing the clerk’s chin with his spare hand. And then he grabbed him by his shoulder and stabbed him with the knife repeatedly, each blow heavier than the last.  
 


I ran to the other side of the store as fast as I could, maybe the employee’s door was open. I heard the clerk dropping to the floor, still groaning in pain, as I grabbed the handle. Thank God, it was open. I hurried inside and locked it using the latch on the other side.  
“There’s no use, Danielle. No one is coming. I turned off the energy on the generator in the back. Did you really think I was going to take a piss?” The murderer said, his footsteps approaching the door. Maybe there was something I could use against him? 
 

He tried to open the door, and when he realized I had locked it, he started trying to break it. I looked around the employees’ room. There were six-packs of beer, soda, milk, lighters, candy, cookies, frozen food, a medical kit, and packs of cigarettes. Nothing I could use. I heard the wood shattering, he managed to create a hole in the door, and stretched his arm inside, trying to reach the latch. I hit his arm as hard as I could with the broom, breaking it in half. He grunted and started trying to break the door again.  

 
And then I saw it. There was a shelf with some cardboard boxes and a box-cutter. I grabbed the box-cutter and looked back at the door. His arm was once again stretching inside, his fingers already on the latch. I stabbed his hand, something dropped on the floor along with blood. His pinky. He screamed in pain, and I vomited in shock and disgust.  
 

“YOU BITCH!” He screamed, throwing himself against the door and breaking it entirely. I tried to stab him again, but this time he simply grabbed my arm and chopped it off with his knife. I fell to the floor, agonizing in pain. “Look at what you made me do! You weren’t supposed to die like this! I had so many plans... I broke your car, stole your phone, prepared so many stuff! If I wanted to go around cutting gals’ limbs I wouldn’t prepare all of this...” He lamented. I was feeling so much pain I couldn’t even hear what he said after that. I was about to pass out, in fact. He kept complaining, until I heard the phrase. “I will have to just kill you, now.”  
 

He approached me and started slowly stabbing me in the chest. I screamed in pain, begging for help, when suddenly, he stopped. A car braking outside. He stood still, completely silent. Someone had entered the gas station. He went back to deal with that. I heard an old man screaming. I had no time left. I rapidly opened the medical kit and bandaged my arm. I had to go faster, I could hear that madman fighting with whoever had entered. I grabbed my dismembered arm, and ran, still dizzy from the blood loss, towards the store entrance. The killer ordered me to stop, he was struggling to suffocate an old man, but I was done taking orders from him. I went outside. There was a pick-up truck parked next to the monster’s car.  


For the first moment in that fateful day, I was lucky. The door was unlocked, the key was on the engine, and the old man’s phone was on the passenger’s seat. I put on the seatbelt and looked at the convenience store. The killer had just broken the old man’s neck. He looked at me. 
 

“Go away. I know where you live, stupid bitch!” He shouted, coming outside of the store, as I reared the vehicle.

 
With my last remaining strength, I hit the accelerator as hard as I could. He jumped out of the way, but not fast enough. The pick-up carried him all the way inside the convenience store, breaking the glass doors, and crashing on the inner wall of the store. I screamed in pain and rage, still pressing the accelerator, smashing more and more of his bones against the wall. He spat blood and more blood, screaming in agony. Finally, the wall itself gave in, falling on top of him and of the car hood.  

 
“You have reached your destination, you sick fuck...” I muttered. I exited the car, the old man’s phone in my hand, and looked at the gruesome scene. He was still alive, slowly dying, his body ripped in half. I spat on his pathetic eyes and went outside. 


Luckily, there was some signal. I called an Uber to the nearest hospital. The Uber driver almost vomited when he saw the scene, but I promised him I would [tip](https://www.reddit.com/r/Matgamarra/).
