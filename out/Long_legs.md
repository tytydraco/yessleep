My name is Alex, i live in eastern Europe in north of Romania, i lived all my life here and spent most of my life in the village i was born in. Recently i moved from there for university in a city over  100km  away, i miss home a lot and i keep thinking about it

You see this village is pretty isolated from civilization, not completely but it's in the middle of nowhere at the base of a mountain with only one access road there,when i was in high school there was a bus that was specifically coming there for transportation of students, technically there are more ways to get there but you need an off-road jeep for that 

The people here are friendly, i love my neighbors and pretty much everyone is nice, in the evenings we would gather at the bar drink and talk, we would sit and go about how everyone's day was, complain about various things, tell jokes and more, it was my favorite part of the day, my favorite thing was to listen to the elderly's stories and oh boy they had many, some funny some interesting some.. let's say strange at least, sometimes they would talk about legends of the region, there were many of them 

One that stuck with me was "long legs", i think i remember it so well because it scared me the most, this story talks about a.. creature of some sort, that you guessed it has long legs. One of the elderly let's call him George said this story a few times, he said the creature would only show up when it's hunting for food, mostly at night but he swears he saw it in one rainy morning when he was gathering mushrooms, " it's as tall as a house and makes a horrible sound when he's near", he said it was almost 8 AM when he encountered it, long skinny legs with shining flesh on them, the arms where longer than to a normal human, it came out of some trees barely when it saw George then quickly ran back into the forest making a high pitched noise. Now this story sounds ridiculous, but a few other people said they heard its noise or think they have seen something similar while in the wilderness, everyone at the bar seemed stressed about this story when it was told and we would quickly change the subject, it's kinda sensitive subject because we have found some dead animals near the village that time, they were killed.. in strange ways, like my cousin's dog, Lili that we found 3 km from the village right at the beginning of the forest, the poor thing was missing some of its bones.. but the skin was intact even the fur, it looked like the bones where taken out trough it's mouth..., another animal was a sheep of an old farmer IonicÄƒ, he found the sheep a km away from the farm, it was only missing it's liver and the back legs with its chest wide open, he didn't hear the dogs that night, only found the sheep in the afternoon 

In my time there i also encountered some scary stuff I'll probably never forget
Being so much in nowhere you don't have much to do there, so whenever i felt bored I'd wander in the depths of the forest, it's a hard feeling to explain but being there alone only you and the nature is a magical effect, i used to go in the forest with my notebook and draw scatches for hours, most of my time there felt magical but there were moments when i felt fear in me, it felt like the forest changed the atmosphere there instantly, for exemple once i was there just having a walk to a nearby old cabin ( i liked to go there and draw ), it felt like the wildlife stopped all of a sudden, not a single insect was making noise the wind wasn't blowing anymore, heck it felt like the leaves weren't even moving anymore, i can't explain it better but it felt like the forest didn't want me to be there, so as a coward that i am, turned around and walked fast out of there

This is the least scary thing that happend to me there and i know many more legends that i truly belive are real, those forests have something bad in them
As much as i love home and miss it, I'd never go back in those woods
