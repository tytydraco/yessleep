How could you do this, Ethan? HOW?!! I LOVED YOU ETHAN!! I GAVE YOU ALL I HAD!!! AND IN THE END YOU DO THI-

SHUT UPPP!!

I- I want a divorce...

My dad stormed out of the house

I still remember that night vividly, I was 13. I was playing on my Atari as my parents started to argue. my father cheated... 

My mother was obviously angered. She wanted a divorce, but my dad stormed out of the house the moment she said that.

A relaxing but dreadful silence filled the house. What will happen now? Will I never see my dad again?

The silence was broken by my mother's soft cries, I tried to go comfort her, but she just yelled at me to go back to my room.

I went back to my room, sobbing quietly. I felt as if all those memories that I had with my parents were being torched right in front of me. One question repeated itself inside my head over and over again. Will I ever see my father again? I eventually stopped crying and went to bed.

I woke up in the morning, it was a Sunaday so I didn't have to go to school, I put my favorite game in the Atari and started playing it. A few hours passed until I heard my mom's voice

Breakfast's ready!

I slowly got up and went to the living room, I sat on my chair as my mom placed food on the table. Instead of the regular family conversation, all I heard was dreadful silence. Without a word between me and my mother we ate and went back to our rooms. My life went on this way until 12 days after my dad's dissaperance.

I was eating breakfast when I heard a knock on the door

*Knock Knock Knock Knock*

I went to answer the door and it was our neighbor Clara

Oh hi, are any of your parents here by any chance?

Yes, there's my mom, but she's upset.

Oh, can I talk to h-

YOU! After all you've done, you still have the NERVVVE TO SHOW UP ON MY DOOR?!

He, he didn't -

Get off my front porch, Clara. GET LOST!!!!

I went back to eating breakfast as thoughts filled my head

Why did Clara knock on our door? Is dad in danger? Isn't dad at her house?

I eventually finished my food and went back to my room. I played my Atari for a few hours until my mom knocked on my door.

Hey sweetie, I'm sorry.. for being like that for the past few days, it's just... I- I couldn't believe your father could do this to me. After all those years.

It's fine, mom. I know how you feel.

I'm glad you do. Hey, do you want to go to the cinema?

Are you kidding?! Yes! My friends told me about a film called Star Wars, I really wanted to see it.

Come on then, get ready and come out to the car.

We went to the cinema, watched a film called Star Wars and went back home. As my mother parked her car and we approached the door, we heard a woman repeatedly screaming

HELP ME!! SOMEBODY, PLEASE HELP ME!!

It sounded like it was coming from inside the house. The nearest police station wpas 1
hour away. my mom got a revolver she had in her car and kicked in the door to the house. I went in behind her, and what I saw still shocks me to this very day. I saw my father, or what I thought was him eating a human corpse while repeatedly screaming 

HELP!!

Without any hesitation, my mother shot him repeatedly, but the gunshots did nothing. instead of falling dead or at least getting injured, he got up and launched himself at her.

I couldn't think properly, so I decided to run to my room and lock myself in. As I ran up the stairs, I heard my mom screaming and crying as the demon ripped her apart. I got into my room and locked the door behind me, I started crying as I just realized what had happened. My mother was killed by my father or whatever demon he had in him. Amidst all this chaos, I remembered I had a telephone in my room. I held back my tears and dialed 911

911 what's your emergency?

H- Hello, my dad.. he got possessed by a demon and killed my mom

I need you to stay calm ok? Can you please tell us your add-

Hey buddy!

I froze in terror, the telephone fell out of my hand

Hello! KID ARE YOU STILL THERE?!

NO NO NO NO NO, YOU'RE NOT MY DAD!

Do you want to go to the park?

Come on, buddy. let's go to the park!

Come on, buddy. let's go to the park!

He started to kick the door in while repeating that sentence over and over again, his voice got louder with each kick. I felt like I was in a nightmare, I had a window in my room, but my room was on the 2nd floor of our house. I had 2 choices, jump out the window or die. 

As the demon's voice got louder and his kicks got more powerful, I decided to jump, I opened my window, stood on the sill, and closed my eyes. I felt my feet sliding off the windowsill as the door to my bedroom burst open
