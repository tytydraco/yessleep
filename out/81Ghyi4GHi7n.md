Ever since Tom the morpher transformed me I have lost my family and most of my friends. I’ve only managed to keep a few friends, all of them online, and life has been very hard these days.

Yesterday I was on my phone when one of my friends started to text me. “i found a funny video 81Ghyi4GHi7#&n” I did not understand what that meant. I had heard of these numbers for years, haunting me everywhere. It was always an unlucky code. I saw it once when I was 15, while I curiously explored the old, abandoned side of town, freshly painted on the walls of the old train station. Then I got pneumonia. Then when I was 20 I saw it sprayed on my neighbour’s van while I was going for a nice walk. Then I got hit by car. The third time I saw it was when I was 25. I found it at the bottom of a sports web page just minutes before the death of my mother. I am now 30, and I was terrified of what would happen next.

My three other friends quickly gave me the same message, word for word. I decided to ask “are you sure it’s not that unlucky one” to all four. In the meantime I grew strangely suspicious and curious of what that video was. “Maybe I should watch it” I thought to myself. Soon I got the same response from all of my friends: “Just watch it.” After a while I started to think that I should look up what this really was. I knew I had seen those numbers, but not as a video. Slowly I started to get the feeling that the number was never the cause of my misfortunes. It could not sleep at night without watching that video. Something was happening here. In the middle of night, I tiredly picked up my phone with the urge to finally get some sleep and watch that thing. I searched for the code and found the video.

At the start I was disappointed, seeing nothing but different flashing images of randomly coloured pixels with white noise as sound. I was about to stop watching when I felt that perhaps I should continue, to see what it was. Maybe it lead up to a joke. The joke never came, yet the excitement grew larger.

I could not stop watching. It felt as though the video was controlling me. I got thirstier hour after hour, continuing to watch a video that seemed infinite. I was still sitting on the sofa, without moving. First came thirst, then hunger and then tiredness. Then I needed to go to work. Then I had a dentist appointment. Then I was supposed to go to my friend’s house. None of that happened. I did not move from that sofa. Then I messaged every contact I could find saying “i found a funny video 81Ghyi4GHi7#&n” I need to move but I can’t. I feel stuck to my chair. I don’t know what has happened. Help me. The video seems to be forcing me to tell this. I just can’t stop typing, as though an outer force is controlling me. I need help!

Watch  81Ghyi4GHi7#&n.
