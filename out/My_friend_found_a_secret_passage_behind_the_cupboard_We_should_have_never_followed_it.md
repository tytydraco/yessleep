It was winter when it happened, just two days after Christmas. At the time I was 13 years old. Josh was six months older.


 Josh was my best friend and the only kid around my age living nearby. We had been friends for four years, when my family moved to the neighborhood. It was a quiet suburban area, with mostly lower middle to upper middle class families. Josh's parents, however, were the exception. They were probably the wealthiest family living there, and their house was the oldest and most expensive one as well. They renovated it when they moved in before Josh was born. It couldn't have been cheap, but money wasn't an issue for them.


Josh and I went to different schools. His parents were very strict about educational opportunities and chose a private school outside the city, but nevertheless, we always hung out whenever we could after school.


It rarely snowed during winter in our city, and that year was no exception. However, it rained constantly, so we spent most of our time playing in Josh's room. It wasn't an issue for me; I always had fun spending time with him, and he had access to way more games than my parents were willing to afford.


As usual, that day I went to his house. I had not seen him since before Christmas. His mother opened the door shortly after I rang the doorbell.


"Good morning Mrs. Anderson"


"Good morning Matt. Josh is waiting upstairs. Let me take your raincoat."


I thanked her, took off my raincoat and boots and went upstairs. The house was quite large, with three floors and a basement. Josh’s room was on the top floor.


He was lying on his bed playing with his Gameboy. The door was open.


"Hey" I said. He immediately turned it off as he noticed me, and his eyes shined.


"Matt! There is something I must show you!" He said with a big smile. Then he went to the cupboard and took something from it.


"What is it?" I asked and let myself inside, sitting on the bed. I expected him to show me the new video games or toys his parents bought him for Christmas. To my surprise instead, he was holding a book.


"You read books now?" I asked giggling.


"Of course not dummy, but look at this!". He handed me the book.


It was a rather thick book, with a brown leather cover. It was in good condition, although quite old. There was no title or any other name on its cover. I opened it and flipped Through its yellow pages.


"The pages... are they all blank? It's just an empty old book."


 I asked, quite puzzled. Surely an unusual thing to find, but it didn't match the excitement Josh showed. But he was already moving stuff from the cupboard while I was looking at the book.


"That's not all. Come look at what I found behind it!"


The large cupboard was an old piece of furniture. It probably was in the house even before Josh's parents moved in. Behind the two glass doors, there were four shelves mostly filled with toys and video games, except for the bottom shelf, which was lined with school-related books.


"Down here on the bottom shelf, look!"


Josh had removed most of the books. I got off the bed, crouched and looked at the bottom shelf. At first, everything looked normal. 


Then I noticed the back of the bottom shelf wasn’t solid. There was a raised panel at the left side, unlike the right side which shared the same appearance as the other shelves.


Looking closer, it appeared to be a sliding panel, though small and thin. It had no handle or knob, and didn’t extend to the upper shelves.It was about two feet long, less than half the length of the cupboard.


"Have you tried opening it?" I asked, fascinated, without looking away.


"Give it a try". Replied Josh with a grin while handing me a flashlight.


I dropped down on all four and slid the panel to the right side. I couldn’t see much on the other side because it was too dark. The sunlight didn't reach far down there, as neither of the two windows in the room faced the cupboard directly.


I turned on the flashlight and pointed it at the bottom shelf. The hidden compartment extended for around two feet further into the wall. Aside from the large quantity of dust, there was nothing there. The compartment had more space to the left, but I couldn't see what else was there.


"A secret compartment? Looks empty."


"Look more to the left! You need to put your whole head in there to see better. Don't worry, there are no spiders or other stuff like that, I checked. I'd know you'd be scared shitless otherwise."


I ignored his remark, slid the flashlight to the other side of the door, and pointed it toward the left side of the compartment. Then reluctantly crawled inside the cupboard until my head was past the sliding door, holding my breath to avoid the dust entering my mouth.


The compartment must have been three feet tall at most. And then there were stairs. The wooden steps led down further in the compartment, the same width as the rest of the space. At the end of those steps there was a wooden wall. The path seemed to continue to the right.


I pulled myself out of the cupboard.


"Holy crap! Have you been down there?"


"Not yet, I was waiting for you. But let me explain first. Yesterday I wanted to try again that shooter game we played last month and noticed the empty book on the bottom shelf," he pointed at the old book I left on the bed "that's when I found the sliding panel behind it, I never noticed it before!"


"I had never seen the book either in the cupboard before yesterday. The maid must have found it somewhere else and put it there. Given how old it is, I think it's a treasure map! The passage must have been built in order to hide something valuable, don't you think?"


"But it's completely blank, what kind of treasure map is it?"


"Maybe it's in code. Or invisible ink. But it doesn't matter, we have to figure out what's at the end of the passage now. We could discover a treasure that has been buried for centuries!"


To be honest, I can't say I had no fear whatsoever to enter in that narrow passage, but just like Josh I was also brimming with curiosity to know what was hidden in there. And I had never turned down one of Josh's adventure proposals.


"Have you asked your parents about it?"


"No. And you can't tell yours either!"


His expression grew worried for a moment.


"Well, I asked Dad if there were any secret passages in the house, and he told me that when he bought it, there wasn’t any entrance or doorway that had to be walled off.

"But if I tell them now, my mom is going to forbid it, saying it's too old and dangerous. And I want to make sure that we are the first people to discover it."


His eyes were shining with excitement. No way anyone was going to make a 13 year old change his mind on this, especially Josh. He has always been the kind of kid that looked forward to possible mysteries.


"What are we waiting for?" I said with an unusually high tone of voice. His enthusiasm convinced me.


"Wait here for a moment, I need to get something first." He bolted outside the room.


I sat on the bed and picked up the book. It was still raining outside. I flipped through the pages again. They were still blank and old. Then I noticed two ink stains on the back of the cover page.


Josh entered the room, locking the door. He was carrying another flashlight, bigger and presumably more powerful than the one he gave me. I assumed he’d 'borrowed' it from his dad.


"Now I can explore properly! Mom is about to go buy groceries, she shouldn't be back for around an hour and a half" He turned on the TV and cranked up the volume.


"Did you see this?" I showed him the ink stains.


" No idea... I must have missed it yesterday." I shrugged and put the book on the bed.


"I will give you the honor of going first". I said and grabbed the flashlight.


 Josh put his flashlight in one of his front pockets. Then he laid supine on the floor and started sliding towards the secret passage, feet first and arms raised up in order to fit through the panel. I saw him slowly disappear into the passage. I got on my knees and waited for my turn.


 Around a minute or two later I heard him shout from inside the passage.


"Wow. Ok Matt, you can come in".


I imitated his position and started sliding. There was some wiggle room so it wasn't an issue fitting through the passage, although I struggle to believe a grown adult could make it. The hardest part was the 90-degree turn when having to face the stairs. I had to contort my body into a very awkward position and make sure not to hit my head on the ceiling. 

A claustrophobic person would likely have a panic attack in there.


Eventually I positioned myself properly at the top of the stairs and started sliding down them. At the end of the stairs the ceiling was tall enough for me to stand up. I took the flashlight from my pants and turned it on, then turned the corner.


"Finally! You took forever" Josh had pointed the flashlight at me. Then he turned around and illuminated the surroundings. "I have never seen anything like this before."


 It was pitch black and there was no other light source. We were standing in what seemed to be a corridor. It was wider than the passage we came through, but not wide enough so that both of us could stand shoulder to shoulder. I started looking around with my flashlight.


The walls and ceiling were made of wooden planks, the same dark brown color of the stairs and cupboard. There was around a foot of space above our heads. The walls were also made of the same wood, but instead of planks the walls featured two rows of raised panel patterns, repeated horizontally. It didn't look like any of them could slide or open.


I could tell from the dust that the place was very old and no one had been in there for ages. Despite that, I find it weird how the wood didn't seem to contain cracks, signs of deformation from humidity or damage from bugs despite being seemingly left untouched for so long.


"Where the hell did we end up? This doesn't look like your basement." That space was weird. I had never seen a room like that in Josh's house, so I assumed we were underground. But from the stairs we descended we had gone down one floor at most, let alone three.


"No idea, but look... It doesn't end here" Josh was shining his light at the end of the corridor. Around 30 feet further there was a wall, but the path continued to both left and right.


"Let's check it out," Josh said as he started walking. I hesitated for a moment then hurried to follow him. That corridor definitely had a creepy vibe.


We reached the end of the corridor and looked at the possible options. In both directions there was another corridor, the same length as before, each of them ending with a turn to the left as the only possible path.


"Which way do we go now?" Asked Josh, pointing his flashlight to the seemingly identical corridor and then the opposite one.


"Uhm...Josh... Are you sure we should continue? We don't know where we could end up..."


"Come on, don't be a chicken Matt. Still afraid of the dark? What are you, a third grader?"


"It's not that... Listen, there are no sounds whatsoever. I can't hear the TV or the rain or the cars outside, and we're not far from your room. This place is giving me the creeps."


"We'll just have to run back there in case we end up in someone else's basement. Come on, let's go to the left" He replied as he brushed off my concerns and started walking.


I really wanted to argue back but I just followed him there. At the end of the corridor there was another one that ended with the same crossroad as the first.


"Let's go back for now... We seriously risk getting lost now. We need a way to get back to your room." My voice was nervous now. I was afraid to continue, but also I was afraid that Josh would go on alone if I turned back.


"Fine, we'll go back for now... But just so we can come back better prepared, alright? I really want to find the treasure."


I let out a sigh of relief as we turned back "I think it's better if we make a map so we don't get lost... We should also wear shoes." We both were only wearing socks.


"Sounds good. What do you think it's this place?"


"Maybe an abandoned mining gallery. Although my grandpa never told me anything about this town being a former mining colony."


"So we could find a huge pile of gold at the end! Very interesting. Let's hurry and get what we need before mom comes back."


Less than 20 minutes had passed since we left. Once back in Josh's room, he handed me the backpack and a pair of his sneakers.


I sketched a map of the layout on a notebook and put it in the backpack along with some pens. I’m not sure why, but I brought the old, empty book, too.


Josh came back with a couple of water bottles and we put on the sneakers, then entered the passage for the second time. I convinced him to give me the large flashlight. We also stopped at every corner to update the map.


I was still uneasy the whole time, although I eventually became more comfortable with the darkness. The silence still creeped me out. I kept glancing behind us, half-expecting a monster to come rushing at any moment. 

Josh didn't talk as much as he normally did, but I could tell he wasn't really afraid. I felt reassured in his presence. I would never have come down here alone.


Around 15 minutes and six corridors later we ended up in an empty room. We never found another split path after the first two we found.


The room was as large as Josh's bedroom, if not more. The walls, floor and ceiling were not apparently different from the corridors.


"It's a dead end?" Josh asked, with a slight disappointment in its tone.


"Maybe we took the wrong turn earlier. Or maybe there is really no treasure," I said, while finishing the map in the notebook "Let's take a closer look around" I put the notebook in the backpack and we examined the room.


Upon closer inspection, the edges of the room were damp. Water had recently leaked through. On the floor in the center of the room there was a carved circle. The style reminded me of the patterns on the walls.


"Maybe the treasure is below the floor right here?" Josh stomped the point of his foot down a few times.

"That didn’t sound like it's hollow underneath. But even if there is... You think we can dig it out by ourselves?" Neither of us were particularly eager to pry the floor boards with our bare hands, or 'borrow' more of Josh father's tools.


"No way. I guess we didn't think that far ahead. I wonder what's the point of this room," he said while still looking around for any more clues "maybe there was another entrance that was blocked off."


"Could be like that." I pulled out the map from the backpack. "We should get back before your mom is home."

"We still have time for the alternate paths we didn't choose. Let's take a small detour." added Josh.


We had chosen both directions at random so far. We backtracked to the second crossroad and went the other path. To our surprise, both split paths were dead ends, the corridor ending without any room or discernable feature on the walls. We assumed they had been blocked off at some point, just like the empty room we found.


Josh was speculating about when was the last time someone else walked these corridors and the age of the whole place, when I  suddenly froze in my steps. I heard a faint sound, like a step or knock on the wood far in the distance.


"I think it's at least 100 years old. No, actually I think it's around the founding father's time." Josh turned back as he noticed I had stopped.

"Matt? What happened?"


I gestured to him to be quiet and then kept listening for a while. I couldn't hear anything but our breaths.


"Did you hear it?" I asked Josh. He was looking at me puzzled.


"No. Hear what?"


"Nevermind. I thought I heard a sound coming from the corridor. I guess it was a rat or a water leak somewhere."


We got back to Josh's room without anything else happening. Not long after Josh's mother came back home. We played video games while waiting for lunch.


"I think we should tell your parents... There is nothing else we can really do there, isn't it?" Going back into that darkness didn't excite me much at this point. To my surprise Josh agreed.


"Alright. But my mother is going to kill me if she finds out we explored without telling them, let's say we only went as far as down the stairs." The enthusiasm in his voice had mostly died down now.


"Got it. They would have found out at some point anyway."


"I'm bummed we didn't find the treasure... or anything else to bring really. Imagine telling people you found a treasure in a hidden maze below your house."



"We have the book. Although no proof it's related to the maze. We could ask your parents about that as well?" I picked the book from the bed and started flipping through its pages again.


"I guess there’s that... Oh, wait, I forgot! I'm such an idiot! It completely slipped my mind!" Saud Josh as he slapped his hand on his forehead. Then he searched through a drawer on its desk.


He showed me a digital camera "I got this for christmas from my uncle.. I wanted to tell you but the passage made me forget about it."


"That's cool... I bet you can take good pictures with it" I said while flipping the pages, a bit envious as my parents definitely couldn't afford that.


"That's not the point! We could’ve taken pictures of the maze! I mean, think about showing a picture of us in that room at the end! This way we have proof of our exploration!" His enthusiasm had returned.


"You mean... We go back to the empty room?"


"Yes. Later this afternoon of course. Come on, just one more time. We can tell our parents after that."


"Alright, we'll do it." I was a bit reluctant to go back in, but I knew Josh would be disappointed if I turned him down. "Mayb--"


"What?" Said Josh while fiddling with the camera options. "Matt?". He looked at me and then at the book.


The last page on the book now had a circle that surrounded the two ink stains.


"Do you remember this being here earlier?"


"No... No, I don't... I only remember the two stains. That’s really strange."


We kept looking through the book for around a few minutes, without either of us saying a word, worried expressions on our faces.


"It must have been there before as well, I think we just missed it because our attention was caught by the stains. It's called an optical illusion or something like that" I said, breaking the silence, trying to rationalize.


Josh didn't answer. Then we heard his mother calling us for lunch. "You're right, that must be it. Let's go, exploring made me hungry".


We started eating in silence. Did we really miss the circle earlier? It took up almost the whole page. But also would it be possible that someone wrote on the book while we didn't notice? I never took it out from the backpack the whole time we were in the maze. 


Then Josh's mother asked me what I was studying in class and we ended up talking about school.


We finished eating and went back to Josh's room. It was still raining outside. At 3:30 PM, we started entering the passage. At that time we were sure Josh mom would be watching his favorite TV show which gave us enough time to spare.


Like usual Josh went in first, I passed him the backpack and then it was my turn. I slid down the stairs and got up. I turned on the flashlight and noticed the backpack was on the floor, in the middle of the corridor. I attempted to look for Josh when something pushed me and screamed. I screamed too and fell back onto the stairs, my heart skipping a beat.


Josh was laughing, fighting back the tears. He had crouched near the stairs and turned off his flashlight in order to remain hidden for his prank.


"Holy shit, Matt! You should've seen your face!" He extended his hand, and I grabbed it to stand back up.


"Very funny asshole... Your face is really scary up close." I tried to let out a smile and picked up the backpack. We both burst out laughing.


We quickly made it to the final room. Josh had taken out the camera and took a few pictures of the walls, the circle on the floor and the corridors. Then we took a selfie in front of the room. We checked the pictures and were satisfied with the results.


"We can go back now. I'll make sure to print a copy of this one. Maybe we could even send it to the local newspaper." He said with a grin, then he handed me the camera.

Josh took out a couple of chocolate bars from his pocket, handing me one. "Hungry?"


We ate in the darkness as we started heading back. Not long after, Josh was talking about the TV show he watched last night.


He stopped talking and we immediately stopped walking. I unmistakably heard that sound again. This time it was clear, someone or something knocked on the wood. We stood in silence for a few more seconds, holding our breaths. 


Then, we heard it again.


"Come on Matt, it's probably a rat... This place is old as fuck, don't you remember?" I felt the tension in his voice. Fear was slowly creeping up on us.  


Neither of us wanted to move. We continued to stand there motionless, until we heard it for the third time. 


Now we could tell it was coming from the direction of the empty room. The intervals were getting shorter.


"I have a bad feeling. Get the book." I said, then turned my back towards Josh while pointing the light towards the end of the corridor.


"It's just a rat. I'm sure of it." Josh hesitated for a moment, then opened the backpack and got the book.


"Check the last page" I turned around and pointed my light on the book. The last page now had an 'X' mark along the two ink stains inside the circle. We were certain it wasn't there before.


There was another knock sound. My heart raced. I was sweating despite the winter temperatures.


"What the fuck..." I could tell from Josh's voice that he was as afraid too now. Then we heard another knock. 


It was now closer. Our flashlights were immediately pointed to the end of the corridor,  but there was nothing. 


Then I shined my light on the floor below it and noticed something. A dark water was seeping up through the floorboards.


"J-Josh... W-we have to go. Now." I said, while still looking at the end of the corridor. Another knock sound followed.


"Y-yes... Let's get the fuck out of here. I don't like this." It felt like the last knock came from around the corner.


I attempted to look at the map in order to make sure to not waste time with dead ends, and then I let out a scream as my eyes landed on the book. 


Now on the page next to the one with the ink stains, there were two names listed. 'Josh' and 'Matt'... written in blood.


Josh screamed as well and dropped the book on the ground. Then we heard another knock. It was clear it was coming from the walls, in this corridor.


"Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Let's run. Fast."


We started running as fast as we could through the corridors. I had the map, so I was in front, shouting the direction to take. The knocking multiplied, echoing every few seconds. They were coming from all around us.


I turned the last corner and I could see the light coming from the passage, above the stairs. We regained some hope. The water had risen high enough that my shoes were soaked.


"We're close now! Josh, let's go!" I shouted as I stopped to catch my breath. Then I heard a ripping noise from behind me, followed by a strangled cry. I felt something sprayed on my arm.


I turned around in what felt like an eternity. My flashlight had first illuminated one of those raised panels on the wall, right next to where Josh was.


The panel had slid to the side, and a couple of long, mangled arms that looked like made of rotten, swollen flesh had come out of it. Bones protruded from them, as well as in place of where the hands should have been.


My light then illuminated Josh. His eyes were filled with tears, and blood had come out of his mouth. 


Another pair of arms were gripping him. They had sliced him open from his chest to his neck. His blood was on my shirt.


I stood still as time stopped. Memories of the time I spent with Josh came to me, all at once.


Then a split second later, I charged at the arms, hitting them using the flashlight with all the force I could muster, while crying and screaming his name.


I was getting cut by the sharp bones, and the plastic flashlight broke. I didn't feel the pain in that moment, nor was I afraid of getting catched by the arms myself. My biggest fear now was losing Josh in this forsaken place. I continued hitting them and trying to pull Josh away, but my effort was in vain.


 Another pair of those grotesque arms emerged from the wall. I felt the water was now at my knees. Then I heard his voice, now a whisper, for the last time.


"M-Matt..." I couldn't see his face well as my flashlight had broken. Then two shiny grey eyes appeared behind him, visible in the dark.


"He is ours now". A sinister and child-like voice echoed from the darkness all around. Hope had left my heart. I dropped what remained of the flashlight.


The adrenaline rush ended at that moment and the fear immediately came back. The pain from my injuries hit me all at once. Tears kept rolling down my eyes. I tried to scream but I couldn't.


I ran towards the stairs, incapable of overcoming the fear. I rushed through the stairs as fast as possible, getting bruises while crawling through the cupboard passage. Now my whole body was hurting like hell. I painted heavily once reached Josh bedroom, crying with my heart still racing like crazy.


I ran outside the room screaming for help. Josh's mother quickly arrived. She couldn't make sense of what I was saying, and her worry deepened when she saw my state and realized Josh was missing.


She made me wait downstairs while she went in the bedroom. 


I realized I still had the backpack on. Trying to calm down, I searched for one of the water bottles.


Then my heart sank again.


The book was there, despite Josh having dropped it on the ground earlier. I threw it at the wall and let out a scream.


The book had opened on the last page as it fell down after hitting the wall. The cover page was empty now—the ink marks were gone. But the page with our names was still there, and 'Josh' had been striked out.


I ran outside the house, still screaming and crying. Josh father had heard the commotion and had stopped working on the christmas tree in the front lawn, as he made his way inside, while Josh mom had called the police, worried to death by her son disappearance.


The police and an ambulance arrived 20 minutes later, and along with my parents and my sisters. I had stopped crying, and now I had been sitting at the dining table where we ate lunch earlier, staring at the wall. I told them everything that had happened since that morning. The doctors bandaged my arms, but found no serious injury.


The police searched the house but couldn't find anything. I asked to show them the passage. I insisted. My mother argued but my father gave in.


Two police officers, Josh’s father and my dad accompanied me to Josh's bedroom. I checked the bottom shelf of the cupboard, and I couldn't believe it but the sliding panel was gone. The back of the cupboard didn't have any hidden passage.


I felt the tears welling up again. Desperate, I tried to move the cupboard but it didn't budge. My dad and a police officer helped me and pushed it away from the wall. The wall was also completely lacking any passage or sign of an entrance, and so was the entire room. I was speechless.


Then I thought about the book. We looked everywhere, but the book was gone. The police said no book or anything else had been taken from the scene, and that no one had seen anything like that. Josh's parents also said they had never seen such a book.


I looked through the backpack and turned on the camera. It still worked. I checked the gallery and all the photos we took today turned out completely black, as if the camera lens had been obstructed the entire time. But I knew the pictures looked fine when we checked them earlier. 


Only pictures Josh had taken in the previous days remained.


I spent the rest of the day in the hospital. That night, I couldn’t sleep, so they gave me something to help. 


The blood on my shirt was found to match Josh's DNA. He was declared missing, and a massive search effort followed. The case made news for months in the town.


Everyone acquainted with Josh was questioned, including nearly everyone at his school, the neighbors and the maid. Even his parents were considered suspects at one point.


The police's theory was that an intruder had broken into the bedroom, brutalized Josh, and kidnapped him for ransom—all while I supposedly watched. My brain blocked out the episode and came up with the maze story as a coping mechanism.


However there were no signs of a forced intrusion, and no ransom request ever came. Josh parents never noticed anybody else either, and didn't hear any sounds until my scream. The windows were still locked.


No trace of Josh was ever found—not his body, the book, or any sign of the maze. The case became cold and the investigation was closed after two years.


The Anderson were heartbroken after losing their only child. They continued with their search. They hired private investigators, combed through every inch of the house—even the foundations—and searched historical archives, but found nothing. 


They went bankrupt a few years later and divorced. Lauren Anderson fell catatonic and was sent to a mental facility. Andrew Anderson committed suicide ten years after Josh death.


In the meanwhile me and my parents temporarily moved to my grandparents house, as I could never sleep in that neighborhood again. We later moved to a different city in the following months, and halfway through highschool we moved again out of state.


I had trouble sleeping at night for years. Even today I need to keep a light turned on or I won't fall asleep.


It's been 16 years since that day. I graduated law school and got a decently rewarding job, for a while I even found love and a solid group of friends.


But the nightmares never stopped. In my dreams I running alone in the corridors of the maze, and I can't find the way out.


I always end up in front of Josh as he slowly dies, while I'm unable to do anything but run away.


I never stopped thinking about that day. Every time I try to forget, it comes back the next morning.


I kept asking myself why Josh had to die. Why not me? Why did it happen right when we were about to leave? And not the first or second time we entered. Why only Josh?


The only answer I could come up with is that whatever killed Josh enjoyed toying with us—thriving on our fear, feeding on the moment it crushed our hopes of escape. Maybe I'm wrong, as I can't explain why I was left alive.


As a result, I have issues opening up and keeping long term connections, as I fear it might happen again. My friend Mark is the exception however. I met him in college and we ended up working at the same law firm.


I worked up the courage to tell my story because of what happened recently with Mark. He was moving into the new house he bought, with his wife and five years old daughter, and asked me for help. I was putting coats in an old wardrobe in his bedroom when I noticed something in the corner.


It was the book. That damn book. It was all empty, like the first day Josh found it. And the sliding panel was there as well.


I asked Mark about it, he told me he had never seen the book before. The wardrobe came with the house. I wanted to beg him to move out, to never go back to that house.


But he wouldn't believe me. No sane person would. 


So I made up a crazy story about a rare invasive bug species my father was very knowledgeable about, and how he need to call a specialized company and stay out of the house for a couple of days.


He was freaked out by my behavior, but went along with it due to being a friend for many years. 


Not sure if he believed the story. I promised I would handle it and explain everything afterward. Sorry, Mark.


I'm writing this now because I'm going back to the maze, and I'm bringing gasoline. I don’t expect to return. I don’t know if I can stop it from appearing again, or if I can avenge Josh. But if my name is still in that book, I have to remove it... one way or another.
