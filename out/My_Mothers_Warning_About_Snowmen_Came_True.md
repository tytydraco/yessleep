When I was a kid, my mom used to tell me stories about “The Snowman.” Not the friendly, magical one from Christmas movies, but something ancient—something that came in the dead of winter when the snow was deep and the nights were long. “If you see a snowman outside your window,” she warned, “don’t look at it for too long. Don’t invite it inside. And whatever you do, never, ever let it see you move.”

At the time, I thought it was just her way of keeping me inside on cold nights. But now, years later, alone in my childhood home, I’m starting to think it wasn’t a story.

It started two nights ago. I’d just gotten back to the house after a long drive through a snowstorm. The driveway was untouched, my tires carving fresh tracks into the icy ground. As I got out of the car, I noticed the yard was pristine, the snow undisturbed under the pale light of the moon.

When I looked out my bedroom window before bed, I saw it—a snowman. It was perfectly shaped, with three smooth segments stacked neatly, twig arms stretched outward, and a crooked carrot nose. Three coal buttons dotted its chest, and its coal eyes stared straight at my window. My breath fogged up the glass as I tried to figure out how it had gotten there. There were no footprints around it.

I told myself it was just a prank—maybe kids from town had built it and smoothed over the tracks. Shaking my head, I closed the curtains and went to bed.

The next morning, the snowman had moved. It was closer now, standing at the edge of the porch, as if waiting to be invited inside. Its coal eyes seemed darker, almost glossy, like wet stones. The carrot nose was gone, and its twig arms were bent inward, as though beckoning me.

What unsettled me most were the tracks in the snow. Not human tracks—no boot prints, no shovel marks. Instead, there were long, deep trenches, like something had dragged itself through the snow.

That night, I decided to knock it over and be done with it. But when I opened the door, it was gone. The yard was untouched, no sign of the snowman or its eerie tracks. The air was colder than I remembered, the kind of cold that freezes your lungs with every breath. I locked the door and checked the windows twice before heading to bed.

At 2 a.m., I woke up to the sound of something heavy scraping against the porch. It was slow, deliberate, and far too rhythmic to be the wind. My heart pounded as I grabbed the bat I kept by the bed. For what felt like hours, I sat frozen, listening to the sound grow closer.

When I finally worked up the courage to peek through the curtains, the snowman was back. It was standing directly outside the window, its coal eyes pressed against the glass. One twig arm held the missing carrot nose, and the other gripped a scarf—my mother’s scarf.

The air in the room turned icy. My phone buzzed on the nightstand, but when I reached for it, the screen was frozen, the words “LET ME IN” glowing in jagged red letters. I stumbled backward, tripping over the edge of the bed, and when I looked up, the snowman’s hand was on the window latch, twisting it open.

I ran to the front door, but the lock was gone. In its place were deep, jagged claw marks, as though something had torn it apart.

When I turned back to the window, the snowman was inside the room, its mouth open wide. My breath fogged up the glass, but the breath wasn’t mine—it was coming from inside its mouth.

I don’t think it’s waiting anymore.
