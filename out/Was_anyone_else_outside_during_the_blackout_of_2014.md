So recently I saw this post talking about the great blackout. I was kinda a little startled to find that someone else remembers it. I truly thought I was the only one. I'll link the post below for reference. But... my story is a little different. Honestly, I'm not sure if I even believe what happened myself.  
  
I was... I was outside for most of the blackout. I didn't exactly have a home at the time. I had just turned eighteen and my parents kicked me out. So I was living on the streets trying to get my own place and a job. I didn't exactly have one because I was planning on going to college after high school. That went down the drain when I was kicked out.  
Ah, I'm rambling. I'm sorry I'll get to the point. I had settled into an alley near an electronics store. Keen to get some sleep. I had started to then I was woken up by an eerie green light nearby. It put me right on edge. Where was it coming from? I was tempted to investigate but was rooted to my spot, too scared to leave my tent. What if it was some kind of monster? With just a flimsy tent to protect me from it, I don't think it would do much good. I didn't even have a knife or anything. I remember whispering to myself "Get a grip, Ryu, there are no such things as monsters." Managing to calm myself with those words.  
  
But then the light seemed to get closer and closer to me. I held my breath. It was probably just some kid with one of those flashlights that glowed green right? It was just a kid that's all. It stopped at my tent wha- whoever it was for a few moments. Then it moved on. As if it was trying to keep searching for something. What that was I didn't know. Maybe the kid lost something?  
  
I was scared shitless when my radio suddenly sputtered to life. I had to take a couple of deep breaths to calm my breathing. It was static at first but then a voice came over the radio.  
  
"This is a public service announcement. We are currently experiencing widespread power outages, and public services are limited. Please remain indoors, and we will update you when we have more information"  
  
Indoors? Did my tiny tent count? I didn't think so. I remember thinking it was just my luck for this to happen when I was homeless. I seemed to always have the worst luck when it came to these things. It was like the universe had it out for me. I had no idea why.  
  
I chuckled a little nervously as I heard the message play on repeat. It was unnerving. I turned off my radio. I was just being paranoid. But now I was curious what was going on outside. I was already fucked by being in a tent so I might as well see what was going on. I stepped out of my tent and regretted it. I had to bite my tongue, covering my mouth. There right in front of me was a grotesque creature with glowing green eyes. Seeming to emit this creepy glow.  
  
I had no idea why I covered my mouth thinking that would help anything when it was inches in front of me. But it just turned around, leaving me there. Could it not actually see me? Was it blind? I didn't want to find out.  
I raced back into my tent, hiding until the sun started to shine again. I don't remember when I had fallen asleep but it was apparent I had. How I did is anyone's guess. Thank god I didn't snore or whatever it was might've found me. My radio sputtered to life again.  
  
"This is a public service announcement. There is no need for alarm. Please remain calm. Stay indoors, and close your windows and curtains. Try to limit how much outside air and light can enter your home. Block as many windows, skylights, and gaps underneath doors as you can. Fill your bathtub and as many containers as possible with tap water. We will update you when we have more information." The little radio went.  
  
Gee, that was ominous. I remember thinking that it might have something to do with the creature. What the hell was the water going to do with the creature though? And what about the air? Just what was going on? Had this creature somehow influenced the broadcasts? What was happening? It was all so confusing. But all I could really do was wait. I couldn't exactly do as the broadcast suggested. After all, I was in a tent. There was no way I would be able to do anything. And I wasn't about to break into some place just to be safe. Which in hindsight would have absolutely been a better idea then what I did.  
  
I waited until nightfall and left my tent. Determined to investigate what was going on. I regret it now. I should've never left. I was exploring the neighborhood with my trusty flashlight, trying to find what was going on. And maybe that creature again. Don't go looking for things like this. You never know what will find you.  
  
Something found me. It let out a deep vibrating sound. It seemed like the weird noise it made was a growl. It sounded somewhere between a blow horn and some annoying deep voiced kid humming. It was terrifying. It charged straight at me. I had to run for my life. It was like the noise surrounded my very being. I have no idea how long I ran or where I even ended up after I lost the thing. All I knew was I was inexplicably lost. And it was morning judging by the light. And more of those probably blind creatures roamed. The sky was the worst of all. An eerie green in color.  
  
This was like some kind of horror movie. And I felt like I was gonna be the first to die. Which was eerily fitting given I was the token gay guy. Weren't they always the first to die?  
  
Just what the fuck was going on? I had to avoid the creatures. I spent the rest of the day trying to do just that when a fucking spaceship of all things rose up from inside the earth, shaking the whole neighborhood. I stared in horror as it sucked up all the creatures that were roaming around inside it. Even the creature that had made that loud noise. I watched in horrified awe as it rose up into the sky once it was through and seemingly became one with the stars.  
  
Since that day I've gotten a job, I have a loving boyfriend, and live in a nice apartment. Well, it's a nice enough apartment for this economy. I've tried to forget but reading that post brought all these memories up. I had no idea everyone else had forgotten. I just thought we didn't talk about it like it was a tabo or something. But now that it was pointed out to me I see the flashes too. I don't like the thought of what's coming. What if they do something worse? Why do they keep coming? I can't understand it. Maybe it was just a trick of my mind? Gas or something? Maybe that was why they warned us to seal our doors and windows? 

Honestly now that I think about that creature that chased me gave up halfway through. Maybe it was guarding something or someone? Maybe this was some kind of surveillance. They didn't seem to mess up anything after all. I don't know what's going to happen next but I have to be prepared. I have to find out what they want.
