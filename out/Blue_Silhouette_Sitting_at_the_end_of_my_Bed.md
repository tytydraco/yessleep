Hello no sleep community, this is my first ever reddit post :) When I was younger, unsure exactly what age but would guess around 11-12 (currently 19) I had a dream that a figure was sitting at the back left corner of my bed. I recall waking up from this dream with the lights on dim in my room, and my room door slightly open (I always have lights off and door shut when I go to bed). I sat up only to see the figure id seen in my dream staring right back at me in the exact position I had dreamt it. I sat up, to scream but nothing came out, and I then slumped forward toward the creature and passed out. Now of course this whole ordeal seems like a dream, obviously screaming to no avail is a typical trait of dreams, however I woke up AGAIN, in the same slumped over position I had "passed out" in and the lights were indeed on and my door open, though the figure was gone.

This time around I genuinely recall with 100% authenticity standing up and consciously being awake. I was well and truly awake this time but I couldn't decipher if I was awake or still dreaming previously, to reiterate I DID wake up in the position I had supposedly passed out in which if you can picture sitting up right and slumping forward, face in the covers of my bed is obviously not a normal sleeping position. This made me feel as if what I had seen was real and not a dream, but I'm no real believer in the paranormal or anything of that nature. I never really thought much of this event mainly because as time went on I basically convinced myself that I was exaggerating the story and convincing myself of shit that didn't even happen (being so young this was likely the case), I also have a big history of sleep walking and doing all sorts of shit in my sleep so that could maybe explain the light and door, but the reason I've come to write about it now is due to 1 major detail. The figure itself.

It was a skinny blue silhouette, and I have recently read on social media people experiencing things of somewhat similar nature but more specifically their experiences orientating around a skinny blue silhouette. This coincidence intrigued me to write about it, however as I eluded to previously, I truly do not hold any belief in the paranormal, I'd likely attribute this to my boyhood mind running wild, though the coincidence is hard to ignore. It also might be worth noting I frequently have night terrors where I hallucinate and see things (generally animals, mainly insects) in my bed or next to it trying to attack me which my family members and girlfriend have actually witnessed many times, and I always kind of jokingly associate these terrors with the blue silhouette but would love to get your guys thoughts, anyone experienced anything similar? Sorry if my narration isn't very clear, first post so I guess I have to start somewhere lol
