In June 2022 my baby brother recorded a video of a ghost, that looked like a girl, walking around the house weeping and hitting herself and in his words, “going through doors,” and although the last part wasn’t recorded, I believe him because I well fucking know that I don’t ever knock. That was the third time by the way. The third sleepwalk. I have only sleepwalked three times, the two of which has been officially verified by my mom. 

It all happened in June. All of the 3(2?). The first time I called Leah and don’t remember what I told her but when I saw her at school they day after, she was avoiding me. The third time I was just crying and screaming and going room to room like a lunatic. I also called her at least a hundred times that night and left real clingy crybaby messages that I’m too embarrassed to even share; but it did make sense at the time, she’d gone missing since that day at school and I’d just lost my best friend. Things got worse from June since they found her remains in December, but no sleepwalking happened in that time period, only June.

So the first sleepwalk was in the first week of June. I don’t even remember it happening, but I did see the call on my phone that lasted for thirty seconds at 1 am. Like, how can you fuck up your friendship in thirty seconds? The Next day at school was the last time anyone saw her. She didn’t go back home and because she wasn’t talking to me, I didn’t even get the chance to talk to her. Maybe if I did, things would’ve been different. I went to a therapist because my mom, and he told me that I just have a lot going on in my mind and that I have to relax a bit. So relax I did.

The third sleepwalk was on the last day of June, well technically not June since it was again 1 am, and it was consisted of me having a mental breakdown. Here’s the thing, during both of these sleepwalks, I was awake and I was sensing what’s happening but wasn’t really aware or had any control on what I was doing but I did know that it’s like a dream or something. Like, I could feel what it was. That’s how I know the second sleepwalk is real.

Some night between the first and last week of June, I sleepwalked for the second time. Yeah sure, the account of it is really vague and dizzy to me still to this day, but I’m sure that it happened contrary to what my mom or my family says. 

I have my own reasons to believe the second sleepwalk. Number one, why did they get me a new phone right after the second sleepwalk? My birthday is in September and my phone wasn’t even that old to replace. Second, my dad locks the door every night that he didn’t used to before that. Third, my mom has changed from that night. She doesn’t ever “stare” at me again like you would at your child. Our conversations are quick and dry and usually end with an ok or alright. She also gets real mad that I keep talking about the nightmare I had that night which is really weird because I don’t usually have nightmares at all but I had one in June and my mom tells me that it was because I had missed Leah so much that I had that nightmare and that I should never talk about the nightmares I have with anyone else because I might end up having them again.

And to be honest, maybe she’s right. I don’t remember much of that second sleepwalk anyway just that I was sitting somewhere dark and I reached in my backpack and had some pancakes that tasted a bit funny. That’s like all I can recall about that. I was in bed when I woke up and the whole bed was wet. Maybe it really was nightmare that I had been sweating so much.

Anyways, thanks for listening. I don’t usually do this and write down anything because I used to just tell Leah but since she isn’t with us anymore I thought that maybe I could try Reddit.
