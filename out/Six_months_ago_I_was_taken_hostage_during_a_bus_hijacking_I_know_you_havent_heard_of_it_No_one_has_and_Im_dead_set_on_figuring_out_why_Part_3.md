The woman dragged me by the wrist into the cathedral and the heavy wooden door slammed shut behind us. Out of her line of sight, Eileithyia’s grasp on my body loosened. No longer contorting under the fledgling god’s influence, my cells abruptly recoiled back to their original shape in exact unison, like the elastic snap of a trillion stretched rubber bands being released all at once.

I wouldn’t classify what I experienced in that moment as pain. Pain is much too gentle of a word. Too inconsequential, too fleeting. A sprained ankle could be called painful, for Christ’s sake.

No, I experienced the brutal absence of divinity.

However briefly, Eileithyia’s influence granted me true sight. She opened my eyes to the promise of something more, something meaningful and infinite to look up towards for guidance: a new sun over the horizon. I basked in the radiant warmth of that new sun, unaware of how numb I’d been my entire life until that warmth embraced me.

She made me feel full. Complete. Utterly content. All sensations that had become foreign to me in the decade since Nia’s death. Of course, I’d be remiss not to mention that Eileithyia was attempting to kill, deconstruct, and assimilate me. But I didn’t know that at the time.

And so, sapped of that perfect warmth, I became consumed with rage.

The next thing I remember was the scent of fresh blood, metallic and slightly sweet. Then, the sensation of something solid colliding with my knuckles. My vision was a blank screen of reddish-purple, precisely the color of the stained glass in the Monsignor’s office. It faded to normal over a few seconds, similar to the transient blindness from watching a camera flash.

I was straddling someone on the floor of the cathedral, laying into their skull with a downright manic ferocity.

The person became clearer. My punches slowed, but they did not stop.

One cataracted eye. Protruding from where a mouth should have been, there was a placenta. A bluish stalk of vascular flesh that was thickest at the base. It extended straight up for a few inches, but curved as its thickness tapered, eventually falling and hanging limply over his left shoulder. I watched in stunned horror as it throbbed out of rhythm with my blows, but I could not stop myself.

Punch. Throb. Punch. Throb. Punch. Throb.

It was Jeremiah, and he was smiling at me.

At least, I *think* he was smiling at me. The skin at the base of the placental outgrowth wrinkled upward at the sight of my rage in a way that seemed to imply a grin.

I blinked.

When I opened my eyes, I was overtop Eileithyia instead.

Up close, her skin was grey like dull porcelain, and her eyes were a homogenous, gleaming white. Her hair was brittle but long, with a sparse curtain of black strands bending over her face at varying angles. My fist connected with her jaw. The strands of hair hooked into my skin like barbed wire, creating a latticework of small cuts on my fingers as momentum carried the barbed strands in and out of my tissue. She didn’t flinch. She never took her eyes off me. As my barrage continued, Eileithyia peered through my blood and my muscle into the deepest, most forbidden parts of my nature: the parts I didn’t even know existed or didn’t want to believe were real.

She saw me for who I really was.

Then, she winked.

I arced my elbow back, preparing to bring my fist down again. Before it reached her, I felt a soft hand on my shoulder. I swung around instinctively, my breath coming out in loud, ragged gasps.

There was a lean, middle-aged woman standing over me with a split lip and a pair of broken glasses. The right lens had been recently shattered, bits and pieces of it dotting her ankle-length black dress like scattered constellations in the night sky.

I looked down. Below me, splotches of blood marked where my knuckles had been meeting the tile floor. I brought my hands to my face. Most of my knuckles were raw and oozing. My right first finger seemed to have gotten the worst of it, with patches of skin abraded clean off and specks of bone bashfully peeking out from underneath the carnage. I’m lucky I couldn’t throw a decent punch to save my life. Otherwise, I could have really mangled my fingers.

Crouched on the floor, I slowly let my hands fall and then turned to face the woman.

*“Did…did I hit you?”* I managed to blurt out.

She nodded, a few springy brown curls bouncing across her forehead.

I tried to apologize, but the apology got stuck in my throat. Hot tears welled under my eyes. I muttered a few jumbled, half words. Nothing substantial. I couldn’t look at her anymore, so I put my head back down. The tears grew heavy and fell to the floor, intermixing with my blood like I was performing an ancient ritual that required both violence and despair to work properly.

The woman knelt down, gently caressing my shoulder.

*“My name is Alma. Monsignor assigned me to be your roommate and mentor. When you never arrived at our room, I became worried.”*

She continued rubbing my shoulder while reaching out her other hand to help me up.

*“Do not feel shame, Meghan. I’ve never seen the chimeras venture so close to this sanctuary, and you are not responsible for your actions under their influence. By Jeremiah’s will, I arrived in time sever their communion.”*

I got to my feet, and she released my hand. The woman took off her broken glasses and carefully slipped one arm under her dress collar so they hung across her chest. I could sense she was looking at me, but I still couldn’t look at her. A paralyzing embarrassment washed over me as I pictured myself mindlessly attacking whatever was in front of me until I ended up thrashing on the floor, slamming my fists into the ground while hallucinating that I was beating a phantom Jeremiah to a pulp.

Alma placed two fingers under my chin to move my head, forcing me to meet her gaze. Her eyes had a beautiful hazel-green tint, but the look behind them was suffused with a profound melancholy.

*“Most don’t survive an encounter with the chimeras. You must truly be touched by his wayward miracle.”*

We began walking to our room, passing the chapel’s historical display case on the way. For a moment, my reflection in the glass overlapped with the Geiger counter, the prototype to Apollo’s ticking box, and I was struck by a peculiar notion.

Maybe Alma was right.

Maybe I had been protected in some way.

But that would imply I had an inherent connection to the mountain, *The Audience to his Red Nativity,* and Jeremiah.

And that thought terrified me.

Turning left past the display case, I followed Alma down a narrow, candlelit hallway, each candle flickering within its own small alcove in the stone walls that lined the path. I let my battered knuckles drag and skip against the stone as we walked. The pain was grounding. It felt distinctly mortal.

The electric lights of the lobby became dimmer and dimmer as we proceeded into the bowels of the cathedral. Once it was barely visible, we arrived at a windowless steel door. Alma procured a key she carried on a silver chain around her neck and inserted it into the lock. Because the door frame and floor were slightly misaligned, the harsh sound of metal grinding against rock reverberated through the corridor as Alma pulled it open.

I couldn’t see what was beyond that point. A rich, velvety darkness poured from the entryway.

Alma held the door open and extended an arm into the darkness.

*“After you.”*

Fear swelled in my gut. I sifted through my memories and once again pulled Nia’s reassuring voice to the forefront.

***Focus and breathe.***

My eyes widened. I took a sharp inhale. My heart slammed into my rib cage.

For the first time in a decade, it didn’t feel like a memory.

I heard her. I heard Nia. Not in my head, either.

I heard my dead wife’s voice coming from somewhere within the darkness. It was faint. Almost imperceptibly so. The ghost of a distant whisper, hopelessly delicate and ethereal.

She spoke again.

Without my permission, I heard her again.

***One foot in front of the other, Elena.***

Without a shred of hesitation, I stepped over [the threshold.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)
