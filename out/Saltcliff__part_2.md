Hey again.

Sorry for the gap — I graduated high school a few days ago, and things have been kind of nonstop. Family stuff, photos, cards from relatives I forgot existed, etc. I wasn’t even thinking about the dreams for a while, and honestly? I figured maybe they’d stopped.

But last night I had another one. And it was… different.

I woke up feeling like I hadn’t slept at all. And my bedsheets smelled like smoke. Again.

Anyways, here’s everything I can remember from the past few nights. I’m writing it all down. I don’t care how long it gets. If I stop, I feel like I’ll lose it. Like it’ll take me somewhere I won’t come back from.

here’s what happened this time:

BELL ONE.

It came just before the light touched anything. Low and full, like it was rising from the ground instead of above it.

It always rang first — the girls’ chapel. No matter the weather. No matter the day. The sound rolled down the hills and into the floorboards like warm water poured down a pipe.

I was already awake. Most mornings I was.

BELL TWO.

This one was closer, crisper. It echoed off the eaves and made the thin pane of glass in my bedroom window buzz. The boys’ chapel bell always did that. Its steeple was smaller, its metal duller, but it cut cleaner.

I stayed still, my arms folded over my chest, eyes on the ceiling. The plaster had a long crack running through it. I counted the web of little splits branching out from the center.

BELL THREE.

Deeper. Slower. That was the bell of the Second Flame — the women’s bell.

It came from the oldest building in town, the chapel with the ivy-covered eastern wall and the warped green door that only the midwives used. I’d seen the girls disappear inside that chapel before sunrise and not come out until dinner. No one explained why.

The sound of that bell didn’t echo. It settled.

BELL FOUR.

Just weight.

Like a hand pressed over your mouth.

You didn’t just hear it. You felt it through your entire existence.

This time, it came soft — like it was thinking about something.

A moment later, Mama’s voice floated in from the kitchen, warm and even:

“Day’s moving, Malik. Rise with it.”

The fire was already lit.

Mama always woke before the bells and coaxed the coals to life. She never said it aloud, but we all knew. The rules didn’t count for mothers. They moved for all of us.

Papa was already at the table, hands around a mug, staring at nothing.

Lila came in behind me, hair half-braided, chewing her lip like it was giving her trouble.

The table was quiet.

Biscuits. Boiled eggs. A few slices of salted ham.

Always enough. Never more than that.

We ate in silence. Not from obedience.

From rhythm.

Then Lila broke it.

“Mama?”

Her voice was soft, but deliberate. Not the usual kind of question.

Mama didn’t turn. Just kept rinsing a pot.

“Yes, baby?”

“If no one’s allowed to move before the fourth bell… who rings them?”

The table froze. Even Papa.

His hand stopped halfway to his mouth, biscuit pinched between his fingers.

Mama dried the pot slowly. Set it down.

Then turned with the smile she used when church elders came over — warm, polite, unreadable.

“It’s the fire, baby,” she said. “It rings them.”

Lila frowned.

“But bells are—”

“Metal remembers,” Mama said, too quickly. “It only takes a touch.”

Then she turned back around.

And that was the end of it.

The morning air was damp.

The dirt felt soft beneath our feet. Trees still hadn’t shaken last night’s rain.

We passed three families before the hill. All cheerful. All dressed in the right shade of gray.

Lila didn’t hum like she usually did. She didn’t swing her arms.

She kept glancing back toward the chapel of the Second Flame — the one with the rusted bell cradle.

She didn’t say anything. But I saw it in the way she walked.

Like she was waiting for a sound that never came.

Halfway to school, I asked, “You alright?”

She nodded.

Then shook her head.

Then whispered, “I think they’re going to Ember someone.”

I stopped.

“Who?”

She didn’t look at me. “I don’t know. But someone.”

“Why?”

She hesitated.

“Because they said the Hollow is being cleared.”

Her voice dropped lower.

“That only happens when the fire needs to see her.”

The schoolhouse smelled like chalk and damp wool.

We copied the same five verses from the Book of Balance we’d been copying all month.

One boy spelled obedience without the second e and got the strap.

I wrote slow. Kept my eyes on the slate.

At lunch, two older girls stood near the well — the ones from the chapel.

One leaned in, whispering behind her hand. The other gasped.

“They’re doing it soon,” I heard. “Miss Ayla said she’s already showing.”

The first nodded. “Mama said she felt the heat through the wall this morning.”

The second girl crossed herself. Not like a prayer. Like a shield.

I didn’t understand what they meant.

But when I turned to find Lila…

She was already watching me.

Her eyes didn’t move when I looked back. Like she’d known exactly when I’d turn. Like she’d been waiting for it.

We didn’t say anything. We didn’t have to.

The afternoon passed, but it didn’t feel like it.

The air got heavier. Thicker. Like something was pressing down on the town — slow and quiet and sure.

You could feel it in the way the wind stopped touching the bottle trees. In how the house creaked just once, and then stayed still.

That night, the sky turned orange behind the trees.

A single bell rang from the chapel of the Second Flame.

Sharp. Sudden. Final.

Lila stood from the hearth without a word.

She dusted off her dress and walked to the door. Her fingers tightened around something in her pocket.

I followed her to the porch.

The screen creaked as I stepped outside.

The air was warm and still, like the trees were holding their breath. I could smell smoke — not fire, not yet, but the kind that lives in wood after it’s been burned.

The road beyond the fence was empty. Quiet. No whistles. No voices.

Just that strange kind of silence you only hear when something has already been decided.

Then I saw them.

A line of girls was already walking toward the chapel.

All silent. All barefoot.

No one gave them instructions.

They just knew.

I watched her until the trees swallowed her dress.

She never looked back.

I didn’t go back inside.

I stood there on the porch, barefoot, one hand still resting on the railing. The wind was warm, but the air didn’t move. It just hung there, thick as wool. The trees looked too still.

I stepped off the porch.

The grass was soft beneath my feet, but colder than it should’ve been. The dew was already settling. My steps didn’t make a sound.

I followed the light of the lanterns.

They weren’t bright — just small, steady flickers hung low on hooked stakes, spaced far apart like stars forming a line through the trees. The girls didn’t speak. They didn’t look around. They just walked.

Lila was in the middle.

She didn’t run.

She didn’t stop.

She didn’t know I was behind her.

The path curved near the birch trees, where the bark peeled in wide strips like old paint.

That’s where I saw it.

A hollow opened ahead — a wide, shallow bowl in the earth, ringed with smooth white stones. The trees around it leaned inward. Birch. Too many of them. Their trunks bowed slightly toward the center, like they were listening.

Smoke curled from iron bowls sunk into the dirt, orange light licking at the edges of the hollow. It wasn’t enough to light the clearing.

It was just enough to mark it.

I crouched behind one of the trees and stayed low.

The girls were already gathering. Not children. Not like Lila. These were young women — most just older than schoolteachers. They wore veils tucked behind their shoulders. Their faces were calm. Their hands were folded.

Not one of them spoke.

The center of the hollow had been cleared and swept.

At its heart knelt a woman.

Not a girl. A woman. Nineteen, maybe twenty.

Her stomach was round beneath her gray dress.

She knelt perfectly still, hands resting on her thighs. Her veil had already been removed. Her eyes were fixed ahead.

Three older women approached her. One carried a brass bowl. One held a wide iron lantern. The third wore deep red robes and carried nothing.

I recognized her.

The midwife from the Harvest Procession.

The red one dipped her fingers into the bowl — thick black paste, maybe ash, maybe charcoal — and began marking the woman’s stomach.

Only her stomach.

Circles first. Then spirals. Her hand moved slowly, reverently. The pattern reminded me of scripture, but none I’d ever seen.

The midwife raised her head and spoke.

Her voice didn’t echo.

It cut.

“Tavra, who shapes the womb and seals the skin,
Let her flesh be known. Let her blood run true.
Let the fire find no fault in her.”

The woman bowed her head. Her breath caught — but she didn’t move.

“Take the child from her name.
Take the name from her flesh.
Give her a new shape, and bind it with heat.”

The second woman stepped forward with the lantern.

“If she is vessel, let her endure.
If she is hollow, let her wither.”

The flame tilted toward her belly.

I leaned forward. I didn’t mean to.

The midwife’s voice didn’t change.

“This fire does not burn.
It remembers.”

She touched the flame to the center of the spiral.

There was a hiss.

The smell hit a second later — scorched oil, smoke, and skin.

The woman didn’t scream.

Her eyes were wet.

But steady.

“Bless her belly, her breath, her balance.
Let her hold flame. Let her carry form.”

The air felt thicker.

My chest was tight. My legs tense.

I couldn’t move.

“Let the Balance know her.
Let Him see her.
Let the flame keep her.”

The final line came like a breath released:

“Let her ring true.”

The veiled women stepped back.

The flame in the lantern pulsed once, like it breathed in.

Then dimmed.

The clearing didn’t move.

And then I did.

One step back.

Another.

A third—

Crack.

A twig split under my heel.

Just a twig. Dry and brittle beneath my heel.

But it might as well have been a gunshot.

The humming stopped.

I froze. Breath caught in my throat.

The women didn’t speak. They didn’t move.

But their heads tilted — just slightly — toward the trees.

Toward me.

I ducked low behind the birch. My skin prickled like it had been dipped in ice. I could hear my heartbeat in my teeth.

Still they didn’t speak.

No one came after me.

The girl in the center — the one who had been burned — raised her head. Her veil had slipped just enough for me to see her eyes.

She was smiling.

Not at the women. Not at the flame.

At the woods.

At me.

I didn’t wait to see what came next.

I turned and walked. Fast. Silent as I could. Not a run — running would’ve been louder. But my feet moved quick over root and rock, and every gust of wind made me think I’d been followed.

By the time I saw the edge of the fields again, I was drenched in sweat.

And the bells were chiming Fourth.

That was what haunted me most.

They were never rung at night.

Only at dawn.

That night I woke up in the hallway.

Face down. Halfway between the stairs and my bedroom door. No pillow, no blanket, no reason I should’ve been there. It was like I’d gotten up in the dark and just… collapsed.

I don’t remember standing up. I don’t remember dreaming anything after that fire.

But my mouth tasted like smoke. My hands were dirty again — not caked, but the kind of grime you get under your nails when you’ve been crawling through something. And my arms ached like I’d been dragging them behind me.

I keep telling myself it’s stress.

That it’s just nerves. Graduation was a few days ago. Everyone’s been asking what’s next, and maybe my brain just wants to check out for a while.

But that doesn’t explain why the soles of my feet were black.

That doesn’t explain the soot streaked across the floor where my hand must’ve slipped.

I don’t know. Maybe I’m sleepwalking. Maybe I’ve always done it and just never caught myself. But I didn’t feel tired when I woke up. I felt relieved. Like I’d finished something.

The weirdest part? I didn’t feel scared.

I should’ve. But I didn’t.

I just felt like I’d been somewhere.

Like I’d gone and come back.

I went back to bed after that.

This is the last dream so far:

I stayed off the road going home.

The fields were silvered in moonlight, cold and quiet, and every so often I’d see fireflies blinking near the tree line. Not the warm yellow kind. These ones flickered fast, white and too bright — like sparks trying to decide if they were flame or light.

The bell still echoed behind my ribs.

I didn’t know what time it was, only that it had to be hours past when people should’ve been asleep. Saltcliff never rang the Fourth at night. Not for storms, not for deaths, not even when old Brother Galen lost his leg to the hay thresher. But I’d heard it. Clear and slow. One chime, then three more, like it was greeting someone.

Like it was warning someone.

I took the long way around our neighbor’s corn rows to avoid the chapel path. Not that it would’ve mattered — I didn’t see a single soul.

But I felt watched.

Every tree had too many branches. Every dark window seemed like it might blink. Even the soil felt wrong under my feet, like it wasn’t quite as still as it should’ve been.

The back door to our house creaked louder than it ever had. I shut it slow, and stood in the kitchen for a minute, waiting for someone to call out.

No one did.

The air smelled like cold coffee and iron. Lila’s shoes were missing from the mat. I tiptoed past the stove, past the hooked ladle and our calendar marked with names and symbols I was still learning to read. I slipped into bed still wearing my shirt and breeches. Couldn’t sleep. Didn’t light the candle.

Just lay there, facing the wall, with that girl’s smile burned behind my eyelids.

The next morning, the bells came again. This time the right way — four of them, slow and even, like a yawn across the sky.

Mother’s voice stirred me before they finished.

“Breakfast is cooling, Malik.”

I blinked at the wall. For a second, I’d expected to wake up somewhere else. Like maybe I’d been dreaming from the woods. Like maybe none of it had happened.

But it had.

My shoes were still damp from the stream I crossed. My fingernails were black with dirt. My right palm was scraped raw.

I cleaned up quickly and headed to the table. Mother and Father were both there, quiet, sipping tea. Lila was already halfway through her porridge.

She didn’t look tired.

She looked… brighter. The whites of her eyes clearer. Her skin dewier, like she’d bathed in steam. She didn’t speak right away, but when she did, it was as if we’d already been mid-conversation.

“I knew you were there,” she said, spooning another bite. “Last night. Behind the trees.”

My heart skipped.

Mother didn’t even glance up.

I tried to play dumb. “Where?”

Lila’s gaze didn’t leave her bowl. “You know where.”

I glanced at Father — he was still drinking. Blank, unreadable. Like he hadn’t heard a thing.

“How—” I started.

“The flames told me,” she said.

She didn’t smile. She didn’t wink. She said it plain, like saying it was raining, or the milk had turned.

I swallowed hard. “You’re not supposed to talk to flames.”

That got a little flicker of a grin. Not kind. Not cruel. Just… knowing.

“They weren’t talking to me. They were showing me.”

She set her spoon down carefully and looked at me for the first time that morning.

“They said someone needed to see.”

Before I could say anything, Mother stood up and started clearing dishes like nothing had happened. Father rose and walked out the front door without a word.

Lila kept looking at me.

I didn’t ask what else the flames had shown her.

I didn’t want to know.

Later that morning, I followed her again. Not in secret — this time I walked beside her.

It was Sunday, which meant both churches would be full. Lila had her gray dress on, same as always, and her hair was tied with one of Mother’s old ribbons. She was humming softly, something I’d heard before but couldn’t place.

We passed Mr. Cargill’s shop, then Miss Bexley’s garden. Every adult we passed nodded warmly, called out things like “Bright fire to you,” or “Keep the balance, little ones.” And we smiled. We always smiled.

Because you had to.

The boys’ chapel was split from the girls’ — not just in building, but in style. Ours was tall, plain, with wood pews and ash-stained walls. Theirs looked older, rounded at the top, with climbing vines that Mother said were fire-kissed. You could smell herbs from across the square. Every window was stained red.

We parted at the gate.

Lila didn’t say anything. Just gave me one last look before turning away.

The bells rang once more to call us in.

And I stepped into the church of the Third Flame.

The sermon that morning was about order.

Not just in the home — but in the heart, the voice, the soul. Pastor Elric didn’t shout. He never did. He just spoke slow and low, like he was feeding you coals one by one, and you were supposed to swallow them whole.

He talked about the “rightness” of things. About how His will flows through us like heat. How when the family is shaped right, and the roles are kept pure, the fire burns steady.

And when something is wrong?

He didn’t say it aloud.

He just raised his hand and made the sign of the Unfolded Cross, slow and deliberate, and every boy in that chapel followed suit.

I didn’t know what I was praying for anymore.

Maybe to stay still. Maybe to go unnoticed. Maybe just to get through the next three weeks without the fire noticing I was cracked.

When I got home, Lila was already on the porch, sitting cross-legged with a bowl of lavender water in her lap. Her dress was damp at the hem like she’d washed her hands and knees. Her face was glowing — not in a poetic way. Actually glowing. Like she’d been scrubbed from the inside.

She looked… happy.

Not pretend-happy. Not childhood giggles or stolen candy smiles. This was something else. Bigger. Cleaner. Like someone had folded her emotions into a perfect square and tucked them neatly where they belonged.

She hummed a church tune under her breath and didn’t look up when I passed.

Whatever she’d seen in the fire last night — whatever it had said to her — she’d taken it to heart.

And maybe that was the scariest part of all.
