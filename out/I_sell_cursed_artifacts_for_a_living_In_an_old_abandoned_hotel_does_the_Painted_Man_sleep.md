In 1995, a series of unexplained events rocked the once peaceful beachfront hotel of Newhall Suites. The sinks and baths began to ooze foul smelling water. Clothes, keys, and later, children started to go missing.

On the cool Virginia beach things started to be found. Ancient artifacts from a time gone bye. Shattered clothes marred with teeth and blood. Chess pieces embedded with teeth.  
The string of occurrences came to climax in the summer of 1996, in which Newhall Suites suffered a fatal blackout. When the lights finally returned- seventy people had vanished- half the staff and guests, chosen at random.

Since then, curious visitors have reported feelings of distinct paranoia, a sense of being watched.

Today, Newhall Suites is scheduled for destruction. But in its center is an artifact responsible for events of 1995, an artifact certain clients are willing to pay a heavy sum to collect.

My name is Quentin Lorreno. I’m somewhat of a middleman in the criminal underworld. I mediate the crime families, I arrange diplomatic marriages, I keep things civil.

But above all I host auctions. Art is a tastefully wonderful medium of laundering money, and hosting both underworld- and legal auctions is kind of my speciality.  
And I also recover and sell cursed artifacts.

I had seen the woman at the Auction House a number of times before. She was wealthy, always surrounded by the same four bodyguards, and always seemed to carry briefcases filled to the brim with cash.

Now, she waited in the lobby while I finished up a call with a potential client. She chatted with my assistant, Steven, and for a second, they seemed like normal old people, chatting and having a snack.

The opposite was true. They were both deeply embedded into the artifact black market. She paid to collect; we recovered and didn’t ask questions.

Everyone wins. Everyone profits, though I can’t exactly think of a reason why exactly someone would want to collect cursed artifacts of all things. I suppose it was the risk, and the sort of show-offy thing the rich loved to see.

There was a guy who collected the bones of a Serpenthead Saint. There was a woman who liked to browse our warehouses in search of a certain feeling.

The nameless woman in the lobby seemed to have an eye for deadly, cursed paintings.

I said my farewells to the client and cracked the door open. “Do come in.”

“Thank you, Mr. Lorreno,” she replied, clapping. She waved to Steven, and she and her four bodyguards entered the room. Suddenly, I developed a fear of claustrophobia.

“It’s no problem serving you, Miss-” I paused.

“Names can be used for such deadly things, Lorreno,” she insisted. “You have no need to know mine.”

“As usual, eh?” I joked. “What brings you to the House of Lorreno today?”

She toyed with one of her many rings and bands on her arm, long enough to make me uncomfortable. “I have located another Corelli, Lorreno.”

Ah. A Corelli.

This did not bring good tidings. Isabell Corelli was, as Steven had educated, a painter who had lived a poor, terrible life in the mid-19th century. Her work came with a reputation in the artifact underworld, one of death and destruction.

Her paintings, sculptures, crafts had a tendency to drive the mad man sane and the sane man mad.

Some of them blinded those who saw. Some outright killed them. And some summoned great and incomprehensible things into the world.

Previously, I had only encountered a single set of Corelli paintings, ones that had pierced even the strongest of spells, and had been the deaths of fifty people. I wondered how deadly and how much risk I would take for the artifact the woman wanted.

“Tell me about it,” I decided; we had the necessary expertise to handle a Corelli. “And how was the last Corelli we recovered for you?”

She offered me a drink, and I accepted. One of her men unlocked a brief case and poured us a glass of Slisik. “Brewed in the heart of the Stetski nests!” she cheered, toasting the drink.

I noted her clearly ignoring my question. I wasn’t in the business for questions, anyhow.

“Those Serpentheads really know how to brew,” I commented. “But really, do tell me about the artifact.” I felt the need to add that I wasn’t paying for the Slisik, but didn’t bring it up.

“Summer of 1995, the Newhall Suite, a wonderfully brilliant beachfront hotel in the absolute best of Virginia,” she explained. “That was the year occurrences started to manifest, people going missing, water going bad.” She stopped, and then found a polaroid of a man shrouded in darkness, hands in beige, corduroy shorts.

The odd, unknown man also wore a sweater, despite being in the depths of summer. “Coincidentally, that was the year this man paid for a room. His identity remains unknown, but what is known is that he spent the whole summer in his room.” She paused to make sure I was digesting the information. “Passerbys would often hear him, in his room, talking to a woman teaching him to paint. And children would find themselves suddenly awake in his room, staring directly at a painting I suspect is a genuine Corelli.”

I pondered on this. “A genuine Corelli? Or could it be a reproduction?” Even facsimiles of powerful artifacts- especially sigils or paintings, could replicate at least half of the effect.  
She smiled and laughed, dismissing the thought. “Something that made seventy people disappear, kid, has to be a genuine Corelli. They say the painting trapped the souls of vanished into the art, and they loom in the background, waiting to be freed, tormented eternally.” She opened a briefcase, revealing not cash this time- but gold. “Survive the trip, bring back the Corelli and this can all be yours.”  
I inspected a bar. “Are these unmarked?” She nodded. “What’s the quality? Is this all vanity gold or are some enchantable.”  
This was the kicker. “All of them enchantable.” Gold, the most refined and rare, could be used as a conduit for energy, allowing us to enchant and create whatever sigils or spells we needed.  
I called over my psychic, Aster, to verify her claim. But knowing the client, I knew it would be true. “You always bring out your Canary to judge me,” the client commented. “Why can’t you have faith?”  
Aster handled a bar, sensing its power. “I have a name, you know. Aster.” The client shrugged it over; it did not concern her. “And Canary is such an old term.”  
Old terms or not, this was a sweet deal, and Aster knew enough not to provoke the client. “We accept your deal,” I decided, extending a hand. She shook it, cold, and unforgiving.   
She smiled and offered me the entire case of Slisik, to which I accepted. “Always a pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Lorreno.” She stood and tossed me a small glass sphere. “This was once your father’s, but now I hand it to you.”  
I studied the glass sphere, empty but engraved with symbols. “You knew my father?”   
She only waved and walked away. I wondered when I’d really know how deep my father’s dealings went. And how much longer it would take to pay off his debts.  
Mysterious woman or no, we had a mission.  
As soon as the House was closed to the public I gathered the rest of my team. Together, united, we were a force to be reckoned with. My knowledge and access to my father’s files- Aster’s gift for the bizarre, Steven’s affinity for spellcast, and Matt’s plain old brute force.  
The client had given us a small fortune of money we could spend on tickets. With spellcast, getting through airport security would be a breeze.  
Matt raised a hand. “Question- what if the painting tries to eat us. Like the seventy people abducted?” This was a good and valid point.  
Luckily, Steven had an answer. “It’s been over two decades since that event, and nobody in the area has vanished since then. I’d even venture that it was an isolated incident.”  
Aster was next to point something out. “Right, but realistically, who’s going near that place?” she pointed at the images I had projected. “It’s creepy, and being demolished.”  
“Exactly- it's being demolished- there must’ve been construction workers or surveys recently, right?” Steven argued.   
“We barely know anything about the place,” Matt added; this, for the most part, was true. Besides the client’s story, we’d found little information online, which surprised me- seventy people missing should have raised more than just a buzz. “Do we really want to go in blind?”

“We go in blind all the time,” Steven reminded, starting to point out all the times we’d recovered artifacts not knowing anything about the place.

Aster shook her head, siding with Matt. “Going blind is fine. But we don’t go in blind for a Corelli.”

“We don’t know if it is a genuine Corelli,” I refuted.

“And we don’t know who the hell painter guy is,” she pointed out. “He was clearly the catalyst to whatever happened there.”

We would be arguing all night if we continued like this. So I offered them a compromise. “Why don’t we sleep it off?” I shut down the projector. “Go home, rest, and think on it. If you feel up to it, meet me here at six in the morning.”

“If we don’t?” Matt asked.

I shrugged. “Then we don’t go.” I paused, thinking. “I don’t want to put any one of you in danger, and I don’t want to go looking for a Corelli blind, at that, without the full force of everyone.”

Aster laughed. “You’re a good boss, Quentin.” I shrugged. Maybe I was, maybe I wasn’t. In truth I was a bit scared of going in blind. And Corelli’s had such violent reputations I was starting to wonder if I should cancel after all.

But I slept on it. And so did the others.

I came in to work at six the next day, ready to cancel if even one didn’t show. But to my surprise, they all were there, already away and eating away at a box of bagels on the sofa.

Matt threw me a bagel. I caught it. “You’re late, Quentin.”

“I’m not.”

“It’s six fifteen,” Aster pointed out, staring into the soul of a clock. I informed her the clock was ten minutes ahead. She chided me on not fixing it.

“I suppose we’re all ready?” they nodded, agreeing. “Steven- pack everything you need. Don’t forget the Silverback Glasses- don’t want us seeing any symbols.” I stopped listing equipment. “I trust you know what to bring?”

“Yeah, all that and more,” he finished.

With that ready, I settled myself in my office, grabbed a bottle of Slisik, poured a cup and drank it. It shot me into focus, and the drowsiness of the morning faded away.

I snatched an enchanted dagger a man by the name of Mognis had given me. I found the pistol my father had often used and tucked it.

This was it. I was ready. And so was the House.

We were off to the airport, taking Steven’s odd but still useful van. City paved into suburbs. Suburb paved into the country, and country soon paved into the ever bustling airport.

Three hours later we were in Virginia, checking into our hotel for the night. And right after that we rented a car and drove to the Newhall Suites.

The place was essentially a large ‘V’.

It opened into the beach, and seemed ever larger than how the numerous photos had depicted it. To add insult to injury, a light rain had gathered above the hotel, and the waves crashed into the building, gently flooding it.

When it was clear that nobody was around and we hadn’t been followed we exited the car, opened the trunk, and retrieved our weapons.

“Ready?” I asked.

“As ever as I’ll be,” Matt managed, slinging a large rifle over his shoulder.

I turned to Aster, who reached out into the ether, a blank look in her eyes. “Something powerful- not of this world. It’s dormant, but it’ll wake when we enter.” She reached further. “It feels like a Corelli, but not quite.” I asked her if she could pinpoint the exact location. “Left wing. Can’t seem to pinpoint which room exactly- keeps shifting.”

“Good enough, let’s go,” I ordered, standing up and walking onto the beach. The rain was cool, unforgiving, and even the wind seemed against us, sending shards of sand flying at every step.

Steven opened his phone, found a document and read off of it, casting a light protection spell. The sand gently stopped.

Matt raised a hand. “There’s movement up ahead.”

We observed the lobby. Ever slightly, there was movement, two shadows searching the area. Perhaps looters, perhaps curious explorers. No- they way they methodically checked every corner and carried themselves made me wonder if they were something more akin to our expedition.

They hadn’t noticed us, and as silent as them, we slipped into the main lobby. Matt hand-signaled us to positions; we would take them by surprise.

“Hey!” Matt shouted, alerting the two, rifles poised directly at them. “Hands where we can see them.” They stepped out from the shadows, two men with weapons as dangerous as ours.

“Calm it, cool it,” one of them managed, setting his weapon down. The other followed suit. “We’re just urban explorers.”

Steven looked at them blankly. “What type of urban explorers carries a gun like,” he picked up the weapon and studied it, “that?”

This was when I noticed they were wearing uniforms, a dark green with a distinct VII sewn into them. “They’re with the Company,” I informed.

Company 7 was in essence, the more legal side to the artifact trade. They recovered the bizarre, took them into their elusive warehouses across the world, away from the hands of evil.

They also went over rogue artifact dealers, and the black market. Unfortunately for us, we were the black market they were so intent on stopping.

The first man, about my age and clearly the leader, spoke, “You must be artifact dealers.” He sized us up, studying each of us. “What family do you work for?”

I shook my head. “We’re independent contractors,” I said. “House of Lorreno.”

“I’ve heard of you,” the other man noted. “But I thought Antony Lorreno was killed by the Company?” This was news to me- my father had vanished on a cruise ship, searching for an artifact supposedly on an island plagued by ancient beasts.

“I’m Quentin,” I explained. “And I have nothing against the Company.”

“We’re just looking for the Corelli,” Aster added.

A frown fell on the leader. “Corelli’s don’t belong in the hands of the black market.” he seemed angry at this, a sort of personal anger I hadn’t expected. “Tell me, do you know what your client plans to do with such a thing as dangerous as that?” he added a final tidbit. “We weren’t told there was a Corelli here.”

“We don’t ask questions,” Steven countered. “And if you people aren’t here for the Corelli- why?”

“That’s not your business.” They both stood up now, challenging us. “We’d like to go now.”

Matt placed a finger on the trigger. “Don’t you move!”

I raised a hand and pushed his weapon down. “If we take them,” I pointed out, “the Company will go after us and burn everything down.” Matt, and the others complied. I stared deep into the eyes of the leader. “We have no reason to fight each other- but maybe we can make a deal?”

“What deal would suffice?” he arrogantly mocked. “The Company hass the information it needs. We can crush you any day.”

“If you do, my clients take business elsewhere,” I refuted. “And the House of Lorreno is inclined to deliver information on… dangerous clients.” I extended a hand. “In this instance, we both win.”

He shook it. “You’ve got yourself a deal.” And with that, the two were off, walking coolly away into the wind and rain. “Be careful,” the other said, a warning, handing me a card.

We didn’t wait then.

Aster reached into the beyond and we followed her, stepping over long destroyed debris and fallen statues. This was when the true scale and power of the artifact hit me.

A deep sense of fear filled me, filling me with dread. I was afraid. Goosebumps lined my skin, and I thought about turning back.

A freezing chill dawned upon us, and as we crossed into the deceript halls it only got colder. I started to see shadows moving, writhing out of the corner of my eyes, and yet, every time to turned to face them- they vanished.

And then they would be-

I felt my head spin and my vision warp, and suddenly- a wall slid in place in front of us, one that had not been there before.

I heard a heavy sliding noise behind us and- a wall slammed in place, trapping us in the hall.

And the paint on the wall started to shift, bulge, and that was when I felt truly scared of the building. “Shouldn’t have gone in blind!” Matt admonished.

The bulging paint turned to dripping blue insects, now breaking free and charging for us. “Steven- dispel this!” I shouted, firing at the paint.

Bullets hit the constructs, splattering paint across the floor. More and more emerged from the walls, living beings made of chemical and dust.

Steven weaved some ancient art into the air. It pulsed, disintegrating the spirits. This was when the floor began to open up. “Can’t!”

The warped and spiraled, transforming into a sinkhole that steadily grew. “To hell with this!” Matt screamed, tossing flash-sphere into the hole.

Nothing happened. Aster suddenly developed a dark look into her eyes. “It’s awake- the thing inside- no, he’s- he’s awake.”  
The sinkhole grew in size. I found myself against a wall, batting painted constructs away from me. “Can you communicate?!”  
Aster tried. “He- he wants us to leave!” My mind shot back to the image of the unknown guest. “We’ll leave!” Aster shouted. An unseen thing spoke to her. “We’re looking for the Corelli!”  
This was when the chaos stopped. The sinkhole closed, the walls slide away. The heightened cold vanished.  
The hallway, dark- paint and color gone from the walls extended ad infinitum. At the end was the figure of a man with hands in his pockets and a stern, tall look.  
“We were sent to find the Corelli!” I shouted. “Who are you?”  
Aster tugged at me and shushed me. “You don’t understand- we need to leave-” she started to back away, and so did the rest of us.  
The figure stepped into the light. It was indeed the man in the photograph, the young artist, hands kept in pockets. But in the dark, he seemed false, almost, different, a mere facsimile of a man.  
“Corelli has given me life anew,” the figure boomed, voice coming from all around us. “It is not yours to take!”  
I didn’t understand. But Aster did. “He- he is the Corelli!” The man was the thing created by the long-dead painter. He was the enchanted thing the woman so wanted.  
We should not have gone in blind.  
The Painted Man phased forward- and then again. He outstretched a hand, and the walls began to return to their original, colored state.  
“Those who seek the Corelli,” he declared, “must die!”  
And then the creatures returned, beings borne of pain. Bravely, we retreated, but with every corner we turned- he was there.  
And then we stopped, painted limbs rising from the floor. I struggled, slashing at them with my knife. Aster reached out and crushed her bonds. Matt fired wildy. Steven cast spheres of fire-   
Sphere?

That was it. I found the glass sphere the client had given me and opened it.

The hotel screamed in agony as I did, and the painted constructs fell, rising into the air and disintegrating. A vacuum opened, and the paint started to swirl into the glass, filling in impossibly small space.

“She has come back for my life,” the Painted Man solemnly murmured. “I have been- forsaken.”

And then the man himself disintegrated into nothing but ooze and globs of paint, vanishing into the jar.

I looked into the glass. A face looked back out, frozen, somber, betrayed.

“What is that?” Aster asked, confused. I told her that the client had given it to me.

Steven inspected it, feeling the symbols. “This is the language of the Precursors,” he puzzled. “It’s… who exactly are we dealing with?”

“Someone who clearly has both the means to store the Corelli safely,” I decided. “It’s not our business to ask questions- but perhaps,” I found the card the two agents had given me. Kyran Grey- Company 7, “they can.”

Ensuring there was nothing else to be found, we returned to the car, and by the next day, we were back in the House.

I met the client, and we traded our goods. I was the proud receiver of a caseful of highly enchantable gold and she- the contained, secure Painted Man.

“I am quite surprised at your survival,” the old woman noted. “The past three contractors found themselves dead.”

“Who is this guy?” I demanded. “This Painted Man. Did Corelli really bring him to life?” I studied the glass again. “No human has had the power to construct new, living beings that don’t die.”

“Corelli wasn’t alone, you know?” she informed; this was new information. “She was merely one of many avatars to the Painter.”

“Who the hell is the Painter?” I questioned. “You’re saying there are more like Corelli out there?” I thought about the implications. “More Painted Men? More artifacts?”

She chuckled at that and patted me as she got up. “I thought your kind didn’t ask questions.” This was true. I was breaking a tacit code. “Corelli’s were always the most powerful of the line. But now- thanks to you, there are none left in the wild- it’s about time her creations given life- gave them back.”

I decided to cross the code. “Who are you? Really?”

“I think,” she opened the door and stepped out, “you already know.”

She was Isabella Corelli. And for some unbeknownst reason she was gathering her artifacts once more, to gather them into safety and taking back their power.

Why now, two hundred years after her ‘death’ was she back- I didn’t know. But it was as she said. My kind- the middle man, the artifact hunter. We didn’t ask questions.

That was the day I started to wonder if we should ask questions.
