CW: Mentions of abuse, not depicted.

Someone on my previous post asked if I frequently encountered immortal beings.

I’ll repeat what I told them - that I somewhat frequently encounter extramortal beings. There is always a way for these people or creatures or what have you to cease to exist, like with Nicolas and abstaining from his… particular appetite.

I’d also like to tell you that there’s a lot more of these beings than anyone would like to know. You probably think of vampires and ghosts and Michael Myers - that kind of variety of unkillable, frequently “evil” thing - and there are those types. However, most that I’ve encountered are more human than monster.

Immortality is a curse to many of them. A lot of these folks can’t figure out how to stop being, but they’d prefer to be moved to whatever is beyond than stuck here with an endless existence. If I can, I help them know - I won’t tell them what they should do, but I will tell them what they could do.

Anyway.

There are also creatures that are here on Earth only for a brief time, but they spend most of that time tormenting those around them. I cannot stress enough that most of those such monsters are simply humans.

That being said, today’s story is not about a human at all.

June 29, 2022

It was midday. I had been tending to Cassandra’s garden, weeding and watering and harvesting what I could, when my smart watch notified me of someone pulling into The Cottage’s driveway.

I changed my clothes as quickly as I could, and though some dirt still stained my fingernails and the knees of my jeans, I looked professional enough. I opened the door to greet my guest - they had been knocking - and nearly tumbled back in something akin to shock.

The person - man - thing? on my porch was tall, too tall for an average human, with four arms and a face that seemed to shift in features if I looked at it too long. He had on a suit that fit him perfectly, each stitch exceptionally placed, each fold crisp and precise.

I kept staring at his face. He was my first anomalous guest in terms of appearance, and the way his eyes shifted from two like a human to hundreds to none and back again made my stomach roil. When he smiled - and unfortunately for my apparently delicate constitution, he did smile - he revealed two rows of pointed teeth.

“Vacancy?” His voice was deep and melodic, like wind through mountain valleys, like deep ocean waters and their deeper eerie sounds. “I find myself without a place to stay on this beautiful summer evening.”

I nodded and picked my jaw up off the ground, leading him to my front desk. I could not refuse, even if the primal horror he struck into me made me wish otherwise. “Welcome to The Cottage,” I managed to stutter out. “Fifty dollars a night, no holds. If you stay more than one night-“ please don’t “we do this again tomorrow. Breakfast is at 8am, cooked fresh every day.”

He handed me fifty in cash and no identification, which made sense even in my state of shock. I couldn’t imagine the being in front of me stepping into a DMV. “What may I call you?” I asked politely. He smiled at me again, the jagged peaks of his teeth gleaming in the warm light of my foyer.

“Call me Charlie, darling. Charles, if you’re feeling formal.” His tongue - an incorrect, dark purple tongue - flicked over his teeth before his mouth closed. “Don’t worry about the shock. I’m quite used to it, you can imagine.”

I sent him on his way to his suite. He shuffled around for a while in the room before gliding back down the stairs and leaving The Cottage without a word, heading away down the driveway on foot.

It was rare that my guests left their rooms, but not unheard of. However, The Cottage is so far from anything of interest that a car is required to do any activities.

I unlocked the basement and returned to Cassandra’s journals, the ones locked away in the safe. There were numerous records of creatures of abnormal size, multiple limbs, and sharp teeth - all with some variant of a monstrous habit.

As I turned through the pages, I noted that all of her pages of notes about these encounters had something underlined at the bottom of the paper: lost soul.

I thought of Nicolas, the man with no soul, the man I had written my own journal entry of and locked away in this same safe. I called him a soul-sampler. I didn’t know if what he was had a name, but I knew there were others like him. If it wasn’t me who encountered another, the person after me should be prepared.

Perhaps Charles had a soul that he had misplaced along his travels, or perhaps it had been stolen from him by some beast like Nicolas.

I would try not to judge based on my fear.

Charles did not come back for dinner, though I had still prepared him a serving of chicken parmesan. I heard him return at some point late in the night when I was halfway between consciousness and sleep, and I wondered again where he had been.

My dreams, of course, informed me. Charles was a monster, yes, but not a simple one. He fed on fear and secrets, on shadows and silence.

He did not create the fear, the secrets, the shadows, the silence. He was drawn to it. It called to him from a great distance. I dreamed of the aroma of fear - the aroma of fresh baked chocolate chip cookies, of well seasoned beef stew. I dreamed of the taste of it, the finest wines you could imagine, the creamiest gelato, the sweetest fruit.

I dreamed of what he was - a monster who lurked in the shadows and was associated with coming loss. I dreamed of all the pain he witnessed, of children undergoing abuse and violence, of families suffering generations of trauma, of any number of human toiling with a damaged soul. I dreamed of him reaching out and nearly stroking the cheek of a sleeping child, of an uncomfortable ache in his chest at seeing such innocence cursed with such delicious darkness, of wishing he could ease it.

I dreamed of a monster associated with misery who wished that when he consumed it he could destroy it entirely. I dreamed of a monster who wished he could be more than a glimpse in the shadows or a flash in a mirror, who wished he could communicate with those he fed near, who wished he could ease their misery.

I dreamed of a monster who looked like a beast, of a monster who had no heartbeat and no soul and yet somehow still found a way to know sympathy and kindness. I dreamed of a monster who was not a monster at all, but instead almost a man who became a myth who became a legend who became a monster by association.

I dreamed of his creation, of vague images of fire and screams and misery. I dreamed of existing suddenly and witnessing destruction and experiencing anger and thirst and hunger for the first time all at once.

I dreamed of a man with too many arms and too much height and too-sharp teeth who truly wanted to help the world around him. I dreamed of a man cursed only to consume pain that tasted so sweet and never have the ability to speak to a human at all.

I woke up with a strangled shout, that final piece of knowledge shocking me with an electric jolt. Charles could not speak to humans, it was a part of his nature.

Charles could speak to me, but I was human, wasn’t I? I had been born, I had borne a child, I had lived and loved and laughed and lost. I had a heartbeat and a soul (a soul that smelled of wildfire and mountain water and spiced rum) and a life that would end like any other.

But if Charles could speak to me, I was not entirely human.

I did not cook him breakfast, for Charlie could not eat food. His sharp teeth served no purpose. Instead, I looked at newspaper articles, at old photos of myself in younger years. I scoured my memories and brought forth old wounds with fresh pain that made my heart race and my eyes water and I sat at the dining room table and waited.

He arrived exactly on time with a smile on his face as he took me in. I was no longer afraid of him, because I knew what he was. I exhaled, I relaxed my posture, I waited.

“The Cottage is a crossroads,” he told me quietly, his voice deep and melodic and now, calming. “I know this because I have followed pain here before, I have dined in the shadows of your guests at past and future locations. I have heard their words as they ruminate on choices that some were unaware they needed to make. Until they came here.”

Charlie looked at me, his shifting face tightened with concentration as he tried and failed to slow the changing number of eyes. I could see them hang on to two - to normal - a second longer, but still, they changed. I reached over to where he sat and grabbed one of his too-many hands and squeezed, urging him to continue. Promising him that I wasn’t scared.

“I don’t know pain, not exactly. I know desire - I know what it is to be hungry and thirsty and tired and weak. I have experienced these things. I have experienced something adjacent to pain, perhaps regret, when I see a particularly cruel situation. I wish to truly feel pain. I wish to know love and humanity. I wish to speak to humans, to ease their pain with words as well as consuming their darkness. I wish to see them lighten after they encounter me. I wish to not be in the shadows.”

He did not move his hand. The hand felt so human under mine, soft and warm and solid. “Pain is a human experience. Even hybrids or semi-humans or former humans have known it, and to know pain is to have a soul and have humanity. I have no soul. I have no humanity. I did not exist, and then I did, exactly as you see me now. I have not changed. Except I have, because I have witnessed so much pain and damage and destruction without experiencing even a shred of it. I have changed because being cursed to hide within the same shadows I thirst for is a weight I wish I did not need to bear.”

He sighed and closed his shifting eyes and breathed deeply for well over a minute.

“I cannot answer your question,” I whispered, the honesty a stone in my throat. “There isn’t a way for you to become human. There is no way for you to acquire a soul. Your purpose is exactly what you are, and by ceasing to do it you would cease to exist.”

I looked down at his hand, at the part of him that was solid and that I was touching and that did not change. “But you don’t have to stop. I have another idea.”

I did not have an answer for Charlie that day. He wanted to know how to become human, how to gain a soul, but gaining a soul is not a possibility for a being like him.

We learn the food chain in grade school, about how plants eat nutrients in the earth and small animals eat plants and bigger animals eat those small animals. What we don’t learn is about the creatures on the periphery who still contribute to the recycling of nutrients in a way we could never comprehend.

They contribute by eating pain and drinking fear. The little they consume is so minute that you might miss it if you weren’t already inspecting within. Their lack of a soul allows them to consume and consume without the burden of experience, and they perform this with very little complaint.

Sometimes, monsters who look like monsters and sound like monsters are indeed monsters. However, sometimes they are closer to a human than some humans are, even if only in their desire to change the world for the better.

If you are in pain, if you are suffering, if you are experiencing fear and misery, you might catch a glimpse of a man with too many arms and too much height and terrible sharp teeth. You might see him in the shadows, or in the mirror, or in your nightmares. You might learn to associate him with your pain and your fear, and you might begin to think him the monster who is causing it.

Charlie the fear-eater lives in the attic of The Cottage now, allowing my guests their privacy while still consuming portions of their pain. Sometimes, if I have no guest, he will come downstairs and sit with me, sometimes in silence. Sometimes he speaks with me, and he asks me to affirm if he is helping, and he asks me if I still think he possesses more humanity than some humans.

Charlie is my friend, and as long as he stays the way he is as I met him, I will always tell him yes.
