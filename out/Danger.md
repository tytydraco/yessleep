“That’s our show, thank you all for coming!”, I say into the microphone, nodding my head and waving to the generous crowd.

For a show of 300, they cheered like a packed stadium.

I give a final wave while walking down the small staircase, heading to the backstage area.

“Great show, they were loud tonight!”, my manager, Kelsey, says to me as I grab a water bottle.

“Right? Did you see the girls in the front row? They knew every word!”, I respond, laughing at the memory of the girls swaying to the music.

“True fans right there!”, Kelsey responds, smiling big as she ties her hair back in a ponytail.

Kelsey has been with me since the beginning, I met her at my very first gig 5 years ago at a dive bar. She opened for me, but she was also a bartender there. She got in a fight with the bar manager that night, and she quit working there on the spot. We got along so well, that we stayed friends in the music industry. My career took off a bit faster, and Kelsey’s didn’t. Though after some time, she admitted she was more interested in the music management side of things rather than performing.

I offered to hire her when I could afford it.

I liked her confidence.

She really does everything for me. Manager, tour bus driver, occasional roadie- she’s my rock.

I swing my arm over her shoulder and gesture towards the small dressing room.

“I’m going to clean up, and then pizza, and then our weekend break! But pizza first, yeah?”, I ask her.

She nods enthusiastically.

“Yes, please. I’m starved. After your meet-and-greet.”, she adds.

“Oh shoot, I didn’t know we had one tonight. I’m all sweaty!”, I respond, dashing into the dressing room to spray on some perfume.

“Don’t stress! Just a small handful of people tonight. 3-5 groups max, and then we are out of here. I’ll get them lined up on the stage, it’s cleared out enough by now to get some pictures. Take your time, though! Security will escort you out.”, Kelsey explains, patting me on the arm before closing the door behind her.

I take a bottle out of my bag, I’m not even sure what the scent is but if it’s in here then I’m sure it’s fine. I spray a couple times and shimmy through. I look at my reflection in the mirror and sigh, licking my fingers and running them under my eyes to touch up my smudged makeup.

I run my hands through my hair, trying to give it a country glam chic look.

“This will have to do…”, I mumble to myself.

I think the more haggard I look, the better the show.

At least that’s what I tell myself.

I hear Kelsey loudly guiding people where to stand from the feed coming into my room.

“Alrighty..”, I whisper to myself before swinging open the door and running smack dab into someone who was about to knock.

“Oh! I’m so sorry!”, I stammer, putting my hand on the door to steady myself.

“Oh, no, I’m sorry, Miss. Uh.. I think I am supposed to escort you?”, a deep voice says.

When I look up, I’m staring into two black eyes.

A man looms over me, over 6 feet tall. 

He is pale, like he’s never left his house, with a shaved head and various cuts decorating his exposed skin.

But his eyes..

They’re dark, endless pools of nothing, when he looks at me I feel a chill run up my spine.

“A-Are you security?”, I ask timidly, taking a step backwards.

The man nods quickly.

“Yes, I’m Ray. I’m supposed to bring you to do some photos, Miss.”, he says quietly, almost like he’s trying to not startle me.

“R-Right! Sorry, I’m frazzled. I’m Skye, nice to meet you!”, I say quickly, extending my hand to his.

He takes it, but his skin feels cold, it makes me gasp.

“Sorry..”, he says, “I run cold.”

“No problem, I run hot!”, I respond, adding a not-so graceful laugh that sounds insane.

Ray doesn’t react.

“After you, Miss. Skye.”, he says, stepping back into the hallway to give me room to exit the dressing room.

I give a polite nod, and begin the walk to the stage. I know Ray is behind me the whole way, but he is silent. He’s definitely not Marco, my usual security guard who I am more comfortable with.

“Do you know where Marco is tonight?”, I ask timidly.

Ray responds in his same quiet voice.

“Not sure, I think he said a family emergency. I’m just here for tonight.”, Ray responds.

“Oh.. Okay.”, I say softly, giving myself a mental note to text Marco later to check in on him.

As we approach the stage, I hear Kelsey giving her usual spiel to the meet-and-greet crowd. No forceful grabbing, no excessive photos, and no gifts.

Though Kelsey is much stricter than I am.

When we get backstage, Ray softly touches my shoulder as if to tell me to wait. Then he crosses in front of me to head up the stairs and nod at Kelsey.

Ray crosses behind the drum set and stands just off to the side, so he can see the whole stage but he’s out of the way. Just like where Marco stands normally.

I wonder if security guards all get the same training.

Kelsey puts her hands together enthusiastically.

“Okay! Who is ready to meet your favorite artist?”, she asks.

The small group cheers, and I walk out slowly, waving to the group.

“Hi everyone! I’m Skye! Thanks for hanging out with us tonight!”, I say to the group.

It’s easy tonight, Kelsey was right it was only a few groups who sprang for the meet-and-greet. I like it that way though, it gives me more time with people.

The first group is a little girl with both her parents.

“You’re my favorite- like- ever!”, she cheers, wrapping her arms around my legs in a hug.

“Well aren’t you precious? Thank you darlin’ girl!”, I respond, crouching down to look her in the eye.

“I asked my Daddy for a guitar for Christmas so I can learn your songs!”, she tells me enthusiastically.

“I am so honored, what is your name?”, I ask her.

“Daisy June.”, she responds proudly.

“Well Miss Daisy June, save me a ticket for your first sold out show!”, I tell her, squeezing her hands while she beams.

The rest of the meetings go similarly, mostly young girls, and a few couples, this is the best part for sure.

Normally I am more relaxed during these exchanges, but I can’t help the feeling of someone’s eyes burning two holes into my back. I turn around and see Ray staring at me intently, while Kelsey directs different people what to put in which van.

I try to shake it off, no matter how I’m feeling about my new shadow, the fans don’t deserve any less of me.

When the second to last group leaves, I wave them goodbye before turning to the last group.

Except it isn’t a group, necessarily, it’s a single elderly woman. She is dressed straight out of the 70s with a long flowing dress, and her cane in solid silver. She truly looks incredible.

“Hi! It’s nice to meet you!”, I say, crossing to her to offer my arm in support.

She smiles at me sadly, and takes my arm.

“I love your look, very Fleetwood Mac.”, I tell her.

She smiles a little brighter.

“They’re one of my favorites.”, her voice crackles.

“Mine too!”, I respond with a wink.

She huffs a laugh, and then slowly looks over her shoulder to where Ray and the rest of my crew are.

“May I call you Skye?”, she asks me.

“Of course! What’s your name?”, I ask her.

She shakes her head.

“Nevermind my name, Skye. I have things to tell you and not a lot of time to tell them, so please listen clearly.”, she says quietly, taking my hand in hers.

Well this is a first.

“Okay.. Go ahead.”, I say, placing my hand over hers.

“If I’m being honest, I didn’t know who you were this morning. I had never heard your name, or your music, but I did come to this show of course. You are mighty talented, young lady. If I’m able to, I will listen to any record you release after tonight.”, she tells me.

I scrunch my forehead in confusion.

“Thank you for the compliment, truly. But can I ask, why did you come here if you didn’t know who I was?”, I ask softly.

She sighs heavily, glancing over her shoulder again.

“Because.. Because I have to tell you that you’re in danger.”, she whispers.

“Danger?”, I ask.

“I am a medium, I have been my entire life. I received a message this afternoon that was meant for you, so I tracked you down. Skye, you’re in great danger.”, she says, quickening her words.

“What kind of danger? I don’t understand..”, I ask her.

“Someone around you tonight wants to hurt you, they hold hate in their heart for you, they want to do unspeakable things to you. I don’t know who it is, but I feel the negative energy even as I stand here with you. Someone wants you gone.”, she says, speaking quickly but as quiet as she can.

My eyes widen in shock at this woman, I want to take her word, she seems trustworthy.

But this all feels.. Strange.

“What else could you tell me?”, I ask her, placing a big fake smile on my face as Kelsey glances over to check on me.

Ray hasn’t taken his eyes off me.

“I truly know nothing else, but I see a car. It’s a large car, more like.. a van? Something larger…”, she shakes her head in thought.

“A tour bus?”, I offer.

Her eyes widen.

“Yes! Yes! That’s it, something horrible happens there. Please, avoid it. Go anywhere else, this darkness is coming for you. And it’s coming tonight.”, she whispers.

I’m shaking my head in disbelief, when I feel the hair on the back of my neck stand up.

“Alright, time to wrap it up, Miss Skye. The venue is closing for the night.”, a deep voice says behind me.

I turn quickly and see Ray, looking bored but making intense eye contact with me.

How did he get behind me? He was just…

The woman nods her head, and gives my hands a final squeeze.

“Oh of course..”, she says louder than she had previously spoken, “Anyways, thank you for the show, Skye. I hope to hear more again in the future.”

She gives me a knowing look, before smiling sadly and turning to leave the stage.

Ray follows her and offers his hand to help her get down, which she takes gingerly, looking at me one more time.

I’m staring after her, trying to make sense of what happened, when Kelsey slides up next to me.

“Alright, I think everything is loaded. So pizza, local place or delivery?”, she asks, pulling out her phone to look up options.

“Um.. Right, pizza.. You know what, why don’t you choose? I-I left my bag in the dressing room, I’ll meet you outside in a second.”, I tell her.

She looks up at me and raises her brows.

“You good?”, she asks.

I nod enthusiastically. 

I want to tell Kelsey, but she would think I’ve lost my mind.

“Great! Just tired, long night, some food should help!”, I respond.

Kelsey laughs, shaking her head.

“Only you could play a 2 hour show, do a whole meet-and-greet, and still have a smile on your pretty face! I wish some of your positivity could rub off on me!”, she laughs.

I laugh too, but I know it doesn’t reach my eyes.

Kelsey finishes laughing and smiles brightly.

“Alright, I’ll meet you outside in a minute. Ray!”, she calls off to my left, “Can you escort Skye to her dressing room?”

“No! I mean, no, I’m okay! Everyone’s left, right? I can make it on my own.”, I tell Kelsey, opening my eyes wide to try to communicate my discomfort with Ray.

If she sees this, she doesn’t seem to buy it.

“Sorry hun, non-negotiable. I would walk you myself, but I have to check out with the venue, I’ll see you in 5!”, she calls out, turning to walk towards the lobby.

I feel that same anxiety pit as I glance over my shoulder to see Ray standing there already.

I don’t say a word to him, but I turn and walk quickly to my dressing room.

Ray stays behind me.

No words are exchanged between us.

I pick up my pace a little bit, my boots clacking against the linoleum hallway.

I need to breathe, just one step at a time.

I have pepper spray in my purse.

As long as I make it there.

I reach the dressing room door and push it open quickly, then closing and locking it in one motion.

If Ray noticed this, he doesn’t seem to react.

The anxiety ball is getting bigger in my stomach, and my hands begin to sweat.

I reach in my bag and grab my pepper spray, switching the safety off and keeping it tucked in my hand.

I try to close my eyes, and breathe in deeply and out slowly.

Every time I close my eyes, I see Ray’s soulless eyes.

He has to be the darkness, the danger, the one that wants to hurt me.

Did Marco even have a family emergency?

I’m beginning to hyperventilate, I can feel the tears stinging my eyes from mixing with my mascara.

A sob loosens in my throat.

There’s a knock at the door.

“Miss?”

Ray.

“Miss Skye, are you alright?”, he asks.

Like he cares.

“Yup!! Just a second!!”, I yell.

I didn’t see anyone else in the hallway when we walked here, but I know I’m near the back parking lot.

“Miss Skye, I am to escort you to your tour bus.”, he says through the door.

The tour bus.

The old woman’s vision.

I have so much more life to live.

I have to move.

Fast.

Ray begins to knock again, and I unlock and yank open the door as fast as I can.

Before Ray can even react, I empty the whole canister of pepper spray into his eyes.

I’m screaming, he’s screaming.

He throws his hands over his eyes and stumbles backwards into the wall.

“Psycho!!”, I scream, holding my purse and running down the hallway.

I push open the back exit door and am met with a burst of cold air from the January chill.

The back lot is empty, except for my tour bus and Kelsey leaning against it scrolling on her phone.

She quickly puts it away when she sees how frantic I am.

“Skye? What happened?”, she asks, her eyes big.

“Kelsey, we have to go! Run! He wants to hurt me!”, I yell, grabbing her arm and yanking her onto the bus.

I shut the door behind us while Kelsey starts up the bus.

“Who wants to hurt you?”, she asks, confused but checking her mirrors.

“Ray! The security guard!”, I sob.

“Ray? Why do you think that? Did he make a pass at you?”, she asks, signaling to turn out onto the road.

“What? No! His eyes, he has soulless eyes! And the old woman’s vision said someone here tonight wanted to hurt me!”, I yell.

“What woman? What are you talking about? What did you do to him?”, Kelsey asks calmly.

“This is not a time to be calm, Kelsey! Be my friend, and not my manager! The guy is crazy!”, I yell at her.

She takes a deep breath, and stares blankly at the road ahead.

“Okay, Skye. I’m sorry. Just trying to think. Why don’t you sit and relax, drink some water, when we get to the hotel we will call the police and order pizza. I’m with you, okay?”, she offers, handing me a water bottle from her tote bag on the floor.

I sigh in relief, taking the water bottle and drinking a long drink.

“Okay, okay. You’re right, I need to breathe. Ray is probably still recovering from the pepper spray, he can’t follow me now. Thanks Kels, you’re always looking out for me.”, I tell her, smiling sadly before I take a seat on the couch in the living room area of the bus.

“Of course, I always watch you.”, Kelsey says.

“Hmm?”, I ask, thinking I misheard her.

“I said, I will always watch out for you.”, she says, turning over her shoulder to throw me a wink.

I smile small.

I thought she said.. 

Nevermind, I am so out of it tonight.

I cozy up on the couch, and before I know it I’m asleep.

When I come to, I see we are on a highway, it’s completely dark outside. Barely any lampposts.

“Kelsey…?”, I whimper.

What is wrong with my head?

I go to place my palm on my forehead when I realize I can’t.

My hands are tied together.

“What the…”, I whisper.

I try to move my feet, but they’re laced together as well.

Oh my god, Ray. He must have found us.

“Kelsey!”, I yell with all my strength.

I look towards the front of the bus, and I see Kelsey.

But she isn’t tied up, like me.

She’s driving.

And Ray isn’t here.

“Kelsey? What’s going on?”, I ask.

She glances over her shoulder at me, the lightness she normally has is no longer present as she pins me with a cold stare.

“Do you ever shut up?”, she asks coldly.

My eyes widen, and my jaw drops open.

“Excuse me?”, I sputter.

She’s quiet for a moment, before the bus starts to go faster.

“You’re really so ungrateful, you know that? I do everything for you besides wiping your ass, and for what? To watch you live my dream every night? I’m sick of it, Skye. I am sick of YOU.”, she seethes.

“W-What are you doing, Kelsey?”, I stammer.

“Finally taking back what’s mine, Skye.”
