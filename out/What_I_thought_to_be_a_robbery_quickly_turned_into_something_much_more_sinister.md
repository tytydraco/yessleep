There was only one destination in my mind at that point: home. What else was left to do anyway on that faithful night two months ago? It was 2 am after all, I had just bet all I had on me, confident about the ability of a shitty team that just let me down. So here I was, walking home from the nearest bar, bare foot with not even a jacket. I saw that man walking fast despite his little limp, approaching in my direction. I coveted his coat, and hoped that he would not ask me anything about my little situation and just pass me by. However, as soon as he got close...

"Give me what you got!" He quietly said while he pulled out a gun and pointed it at me.

I froze, my attention stolen by the barrel, till I noticed how the gun was shaking, how he was trembling. My gaze then made the trip from his hand to his head, uncovering the sweaty, anxiety-ridden face of a middle-aged man whose profile did not fit the job in my opinion.

"I don't have shit on me mate." I quietly answered, taking furtive looks around for a potential help or an opportunity to dash.

"I'll say this again nicely kid, just give me what you got, anything, please!" He spoke.

Please? Which robber begs when he is doing his deed? "I swear I don't have anything. No phone, no money, I just— I just lost a damn—"

"What?" He asked, looking to his right at an empty space. "Then why did— what do I do now? It's almost time!" He spoke, freaking out and checking the time on his watch.

"Sir, are you sure you— I was just saying that—"

"FUCKIN SHUT UP!" He yelled. At this point, he was hyperventilating and trembling so much more that I believed he was about to shoot involuntarily. He then searched himself and pulled out a knife before tossing it towards me. "Give me your hand." He calmly said.

"Huh?" That was the only thing that came out of my mouth, trying to grasp what he really meant, my eyes on the knife or rather the blade as it had no handle.

"Take the knife, cut off your hand and give it to me."

"What? How— how do you want me to—"

"Wait! Just wait, he'll do it! I know he'll do it!" He spoke, looking to his right again. "Come on Ulrik! Hurry!"

"What? Who— how do you know my name?"

"JUST DO IT COME ON! IT'S ALMOST TIME!" He yelled again, checking his watch. "Please just do it, it's almost time. Just do it before it's too late, please!" He added, going from blazing rage to absolute despair.

I picked up the knife, sweating in the cold of the night, then trembling as well, overwhelmed by the same nervousness that invaded him. Clenching the blade unconsciously, I did not feel anything and only watched a few drops of blood escape from my fist.

"DO IT ULRIK!!!"

The sirens of the police then resounded almost immediately. I expected him to run away or grab me and hold me hostage or something. All he did was shouting at me to do it, but there was no way I could do such a thing. Two police cars soon came into view and the despair on the man's face pulled tears from his eyes as he then placed the gun under his chin.

"Sorry Ulrik. Your turn." He said before he ended himself, right in front of me as I released the blade in complete shock.

Later on, it was confirmed that the man had just escaped from an asylum. He had serious mental health issues, hearing voices and all that. This is exactly what I thought until something much more bizarre happened, and I neither understand what it means nor what to do. A few days ago, I was busy loading some clothes into my washing machine when I felt something strange hidden in the pocket of a jacket.

I pulled it out only to realize that it was a knife. It had no handle.
