When my baby brother was about 6, he had a friend named Joseph.

But no one could see Joseph.. except for him.

We all played along. My mom would send extra snacks with my brother for school, so Joseph could have some too. My dad would ask how him and Joseph’s days were. My brother always responded animatedly, describing their day in detail. Grand stories of adventures in the old mining caves, chasing rabbits, and drinking from streams.

It was harmless, it was sweet.

Until the boys started to go missing.

One by one, boys at our school started not showing up. Some stayed home, refusing to go to school because “Joseph” was going to hurt them.. Some disappeared altogether. The school tried to look into it, but found no Joseph at the small school. 

“It’s just a prank, just boys trying to get out of class, pay them no mind..”, my brother’s teacher had told my parents.

One night, I heard my brother crying through the walls.

It was muffled, but I could make out one sentence.

“You’re not being fair, Joseph. She’s my sister, I don’t want to play with you anymore!”

I immediately got up and walked to my parent’s room, I told them someone was in my brother’s room talking to him. When we all went and opened his door, my brother was sitting up in his bed looking at the window.

When we asked who he was talking to, he responded in an emotionless voice.

“No one, I was just listening to music.”

I tried to protest, but my parents shrugged me off and hurried me back to sleep.

Later that evening, I was awoken by a noise in my bedroom, a creak in the floor.

My eyes opened immediately and through my sleepy gaze, I tried to look around the room. Standing by my closed bedroom door, was a man.

He was thin, and tall like a beanpole. His height made him hunch over, and his focus was directly on me.

I tried to scream, cry, yell. But the terror made me silent. Only the sound of my heavy breathing convinced me this wasn’t a dream.

In the darkness, I saw the man pull something from his side. With the glow of the moon from the window, I saw the glint of a knife.

My body sprang into action as I jumped backwards on the bed as the man came towards me. As he came closer I could see his face up close. Garish, scarred, manic, almost like an animal. 

I finally screamed out at the sight of his face, and started to kick.

He grabbed my ankles and tried to push them down, his face broke into a smile dripping with anticipation.

My door opened.

My parents, I thought.

Only it was my brother.

“Joseph!!!”, he cried out, “Joseph I told you no!! Not her!!”

My little brother started to throw things at Joseph, screaming at him to get off me.

It distracted Joseph enough that I kicked his jaw and he fell off the bed onto the floor, groaning in pain.

My parents ran in immediately, my mom screamed in horror at the grown man laying on the ground while my dad told her to call the police.

My little brother ran up to me, tears streaming down his face.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I told him not you, NOT YOU. You aren’t bad! He said bad people had to go! Joseph wanted to help! I didn’t want him to hurt you too!”, he said, sobbing into my pajamas.

I held my sobbing brother as me and my dad blankly stared at the man on the ground, who had made no effort to move from his spot.

After the police had come, and Joseph had been taken away, we tucked my brother into bed and told him to try to get some rest.

After I was finished with my questioning, the officer thanked me for my time, and said he would be in touch.

“Do you think he’s responsible for the missing boys?”, I asked the officer, bundling my blanket around my shoulders.

“We think it’s possible,” he responded, “We are looking into any properties Joseph had, any surveillance footage. We will also be running his DNA to see if he’s linked to anything else nearby.”

I couldn’t help thinking about all those boys, because they were.. bad? Is that what my brother said? That’s hardly a cause for threats or… worse.

“One second”, the officer said, after hearing something on his radio. He stepped out of the room.

My mom brought me a cup of tea to calm my nerves, and my parents sat on either side of me.

When the officer returned, his face was grim.

“What is it?”, I asked immediately.

“I don’t know how to tell you this,” he was holding a small crumbled up piece of paper, “but this wasn’t a random killer just targeting random kids..”

“Why would you say that?”, my dad asked.

“Well sir, because we think the original target was your daughter. It’s been her all this time.”

When he unfolded the paper, it was a picture of me. From about 2 years ago, with names scribbled on the back with certain ones crossed out.

I didn’t notice when it first started, but I had interactions with every boy on that list.

Some walked home with me once or twice, I sat next to some in church, or they held a door for me.

He’s been watching.. me?

As I scanned down the list, the last name caught my attention immediately. 

My eyes widened, and I lost my grip on my mug, I felt it fall and shatter on the floor.

My little brother was next on the list.
