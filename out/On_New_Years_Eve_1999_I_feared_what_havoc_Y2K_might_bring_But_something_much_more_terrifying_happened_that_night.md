It was 10:05 am on Wednesday, November 10th, 1999, less than two months away from  the impending "Year 2000 Problem,” more commonly referred to as "Y2K," when the President stopped at The South Grounds to speak to the press, on his way to York, Pennsylvania.  


  
"We are releasing our fourth and final quarterly report on public and private efforts to address the Y2K computer problem. The report shows that our hard work in this country is paying off. And while there is more to do, I expect we will experience no major national breakdowns as a result of the Year 2000 date change."  


  
At the time, it seemed a little too good to be true, a little too convenient, that the apocalypse we had been warned about for years, was suddenly of no concern.  


  
Which is why, less than two months later, on Friday, December 31st, 1999, the eve of destruction, I threw an "armageddon party."  


  
But little did I know at the time, how ironic the party's theme really was, given what would happen to us that night. Little did I know, that something much more terrifying than Y2K, was in store for us.

"It's simple." Dennis said to me, as I stood there in the kitchen, talking with him and Brad. "You just ask her. Suzanne, want to be my New Year's kiss?"  


  
"No, you idiot!" Brad replied, "At midnight, you just go for it. Chicks dig when you take initiative."  


  
"Uh, I dunno, guys." I said, not quite buying either suggestion.  


  
"Wait, wait, I got it, I got it. Come with me!" Brad demanded, with a cheeky smile, as he grabbed me by the collar, leading myself and Dennis out of the kitchen and into the living room.  


  
"No, whatever it is, please don't." I mumbled.  


  
But it was too late.  


  
"Ladies and gentlemen!" Brad called out to the group of friends, who were gathered around the coffee table, laughing and drinking. It was a mix of four guys and seven girls, not counting Brad, Dennis, and myself, fourteen in total. Brad looked down at his watch. "With under an hour left before the end of days, I have a proposition!"  


  
The group of friends fell silent, awaiting his announcement, until...  


  
"Seven minutes in heaven!" Brad screamed, at the top of his lungs.  


  
Suddenly, everyone burst out laughing, half of the group cheering on the idea, and half panning it.  


  
"What? I'm serious! Who's gonna go first?" Brad asked, as he scanned the room. "Hmm, let's see, how about..."  


  
*Let me guess. He's gonna pick me.* I thought to myself.  


  
"...Mikey..."  


  
*Shocker.* I put my hand over my face in embarrassment, as Brad pointed at me.  


  
"Hey, chill out, man!" Dennis yelled to Brad, but he ignored him.  


  
"...And, why not..." Brad said, continuing to look around.  


  
*Let me guess. Suzanne.*  


  
"...Suzanne?"  


  
*Asshole.*  


  
Suzanne immediately turned bright red, as she, too, covered her face, smiling.  


  
"Dude-" I began to whisper to Brad, but he immediately pushed me away.  


  
"Well, what say you, Suzanne? Totally up to you, no pressure!"  


  
The group turned to Suzanne...  


  
"Uh, sure, why not?"  


  
...And then back to me.  


  
"Uh-" I replied, but before I could continue, Brad opened a nearby closet door and shoved me in.  


  
"Thank me later." He said with a wink.  


  
"You're an asshole." I replied with a dirty look.  


  
And like that, Suzanne walked over, stepped into the closet with me, and shut the door behind her.  


  
That's... when things got... weird.  


  
And not like... a good weird.  


  
Like... a very, very bad weird.  


  
You see, a few minutes later, while Suzanne and I were making awkward smalltalk in the closet, discussing how long we should let everyone think that we're making out... because, let's be honest, I didn't have the courage to initiate making out... we heard a commotion.  


  
At first, I think I heard something like, a knock at the front door of the apartment, a conversation, and raised voices, each drowned out by the TV speakers, which were blasting a telecast of the New Year’s Eve countdown, live from NYC.  


  
We didn't think much of it.  


  
"What was that?" Suzanne asked me.  


  
"I don't know, maybe someone called the cops on us for being too loud?" I offered up. It was a shot in the dark, pun intended. "You want to step out?"  


  
"Nah, they'll figure it out."  


  
I was relieved that she declined the offer, and chose to stay in there with me. *Maybe I have a shot, after all.* I wondered.  


  
But then, the commotion grew louder, as it moved into the living room, directly outside the closet door.  


  
"Open the door a little," Suzanne whispered, clearly a little concerned.  


  
I did as she asked, and quietly cracked the closet door just a little, just enough so that we could see a sliver of what was going on in the living room.  


  
That's when I first saw... them.  


  
A group of hooded intruders, all wearing the same long robes and holding what looked like the same crescent blades, shoving my friends to the ground.  


  
"Get on the floor!" One of them screamed.  


  
"Tie them up." Another ordered, as the rest of the hooded men rounded up my friends, and gathered them into a circle at the center of the room.  


  
"Please, don't hurt us!" I heard a friend cry out.  


  
"Let me go!" Another yelled.  


  
Meanwhile, inside the closet, where luckily no one knew, or remembered, that we were in, Suzanne and I said nothing. We just stood there quietly in the closet, listening on in horror.  


  
I pulled out my cell phone, lowered its volume, called the police, and simply whispered my address and, “Help”.  


  
The living room then grew silent, aside from what sounded like a few muffled screams, until we heard one of the intruders yell...  


  
"The time has come!"  


  
Then, through the slit in the open closet door, I saw two of the introducers grab two of my friends, and draw their blades…  


  
…Followed by the sound of two slashing noises...two thuds... and my friends screaming.  


  
I squinted through the opening of the door to see what had happened, and spotted two friends, lying on the floor, blood pouring out of them and seeping into the carpet.  


  
"You have both fulfilled your duty and your service to this life. May the end of the millennium, and the world as we know it, bring you safely into the next."  


  
I then saw the very same two intruders, who had just killed my friends, raise the very same blades that they had executed them with, and execute themselves, toppling to the floor beside them.  


  
*It's a fucking Y2K Death Cult.* I thought to myself.  


  
I would later learn, that I was right.  


  
The same ritualistic sacrifice went on a few more times, performed by two members of the cult at a time, on two friends at a time, as Suzanne and I clung to each other in the dark, our hands covering each other's mouths.  


  
Through the crack, I eventually saw the last of my friends, Dennis and Brad, fall to the floor.  


  
At that point, only two intruders remained, with no one left to sacrifice.  


  
"Two are missing." One said to the other.  


  
"Find them." The other replied. "We must join the others in the afterlife."  


  
Assuming that they were referring to Suzanne and I, and anticipating that they would find us any minute now, I quietly reached down in the dark closet, searching for an object to defend myself with, but found nothing.  


  
*Fuck.*  


  
It was then that I devised a plan, wherein, should the intruders open the closet door, I would leap at them with all my might, tackle them to the ground, and attempt to take their weapons.  


  
And so, that is exactly what I did.  


  
Well, at least… partially.  


  
Sure enough, after a couple minutes, over the sound of the New Year's Eve broadcast playing on the TV, I heard them begin rummaging through the apartment...  


  
...As they got closer...  


  
...And closer...   


  
...And closer…  


  
Until finally, I heard the living room floors creak, as someone crept over to the closet, and slowly turned the doorknob.  


  
—  


  
The next thing I knew, I was lying face down in the living room, collapsed on top of one of the intruders, who I now saw had been impaled by his own, crescent blade.  


  
*How the fuck did I pull that off?*  


  
Hearing Suzanne scream, and remembering that there had been two cult members left, I hopped up to my feet and whipped around, only to find the last of their ranks grappling with Suzanne, as he attempted to pull her out of the closet.  


  
His back to me, I seized the opportunity, and, pulling the weapon out of the dead intruder that I had just tackled, charged at the cult member, and pierced it through his torso.  


  
He fell back, arms flailing, as if trying to swat away whoever had just impaled him, but by the time he fell to the floor, he, too, was dead.  


  
Suzanne and I locked eyes, and just stood there in silence, wide eyed and shaking, the only sound in the room, that of the New Year’s Eve countdown, still blaring from the TV.  


  
And then, we heard…  


  
"...5..."  


  
"...4..."  


  
"...3..."  


  
"...2..."  


  
"...1..."  


  
"Happy New Year!"  


  
Suzanne and I both looked over at the TV, then back at each other, before simultaneously leaning in for a passionate kiss, as "Auld Lang Syne" rang out across the room.  


  
A room, filled to the brim with the bodies of cult members and friends alike, one dead intruder for every friend sacrificed.  


  
I pulled away from the kiss for a moment.  


  
"The cops will be here any minute." I said, looking down at the carnage all around us.  


  
"Just one more minute." Suzanne replied.  


  
She pulled me back in.  


  
I must have blacked out after that, but the police would later tell me, that when they arrived, they found us still standing there in the center of the room, still shaking, and still locked in a loving embrace, the New Year’s Eve after-show still playing on the TV.  


  
—  


  
And so, on Saturday, January 1st, 2000, the entire world let out a huge sigh of relief, as the feared Y2K disaster failed to materialize, instead welcoming in the dawn of the new millennium.  


  
In the 24 years that followed, many have looked back on the scare as a flop, debating whether the anticlimactic outcome was inevitable, a speculation blown out of proportion, or that the efforts of those who heeded the warnings, prevented what would have become an actual catastrophe. We may never know.  


  
But for Suzanne and I, we look back on it as something... else.
