\[Part 1\](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1bb6dlj/i\_used\_to\_a\_soldier\_something\_found\_us\_in\_the/)

We made torches from my ruined uniform. The small patches of light were like a small island amid the sea of darkness. Kiril was carrying Batu who pointed the direction, while I was watching for any signs of trouble. I breathed deeply, staring into the darkness holding the torch high like Prometheus.   
The idea of spending more time in this forest didn’t fill me with joy.   

I kicked myself again for not taking a flashlight. This was supposed to be a punishment, not a field exercise. We took as little as possible hoping that the lieutenant would not notice. The flashlights were at the bottom of our list of priorities. No radio either – the things were just too heavy.   
   
The eerie silence returned. No sound could be heard. Just us, our uneven steps, and the gentle cracking of the torches. However, we already knew that this was a lie. Those things… We had never seen anything like this. They moved so fast and inhumanly agile – jumping from tree to tree, flanking and fooling us. I tried not to think what would happen if they managed to surround us…   
The wound on Batu’s leg was not pretty – deep and clean as if made by a scalpel. He lost plenty of blood before I was able to stabilize him. Not hard to imagine, what it would look like if it were his neck and not just a leg.   
But the worst part – unlike us, those creatures could navigate in the dark. I didn’t know how: maybe they used echolocation like bats, or straight-up had infrared vision like Predator.   
   
It unnerved me – the fact that we were blind, bumping like a bunch of drunkards in the dark. They could watch us and wait and savor our fear. Hell, one of them could sit on a tree 10 meters away, deciding what body parts they wanted to eat first.   
   
The thought made me look up, but of course, I found nothing – the bastards might be looking straight at my face, and I would not be able to tell.   
   
I kept my AKM on Full Auto, ready to fire any moment. We knew we could hurt them – at least I hoped we could hurt them. The alternative was not inspiring: maybe they had got what they wanted. Maybe Dima didn’t get too far after all? The guy ran straight into the dark screaming like a lunatic. Judging how fast they jumped; I doubted Dima would have gone far.   
   
We walked and walked again and walked a little bit more. Several hours of painfully slow march. Not sure how far we went in this darkness. Maybe a few kilometers? Pretty soon, I could hear Kiril huffing and slowing down. Batu was not exactly a feather.   
   
“We need to rest,” Batu protested. “If they attack, we must be in full strength”.  
   
Kiril just shrugged and fell to the ground exhausted. I stood guard. The dim light of torches was painfully small – we could barely see a few meters around, surrounded by the dense forest. In this darkness, the feeling was surprisingly claustrophobic.   
   
Ten minutes later we prepared to go until Batu spoke:  
   
“Am I dying, or there is a light out there?” he pointed his finger somewhere.   
   
I saw a barely noticeable flicker in the distance. Like a tiny candlelight.   
   
‘Well?” Kiril spat on the ground. “Objections?”   
   
We moved silently, not knowing what to expect.  
   
My eyes were darting from one tree to another. It would be really easy to ambush us if we rushed towards like moths to a flame. I felt blood beating in my ears, my palms got sweaty and my breathing was hard and heavy.   
I almost growled when a light in the distance disappeared suddenly. We all frowned and prepared for an attack. Ambush after all.   
   
We stood back-to-back, ready to fight back. Kiril was shaking, Batu was praying, and my heart was ready to jump out of my chest. My eyes were tearing up, knowing that the end was near. But to my surprise, nothing had happened. No attack followed, the silence didn’t break with screeches or growls.   
   
So, we carefully continue moving in the direction of the light with a slither of hope in our hearts. Finally, we entered a small opening lit by moonlight. And in the middle of the opening was an old wooden cabin.   
   
It was… well not even a cabin, more like a shack half buried in the ground and with the roof completely covered by moss. I noticed a tiny empty window and a wooden door barely big enough for a man.   
   
“Reminds me of something” Kiril laughed darkly. “a King and a Fool, huh?”   
   
“Then let’s hope the woodsman won’t offer us to feed his friends” I growled.   
   
I barged in, guns blazing, preparing to shoot on sight. But there was no one inside a small room. Just a table, a rusty potbelly stove, a bed, and a wooden chest. A human skull was lying peacefully on the ground. A huge dark smudge covered the floor. Looked suspiciously like a dried blood. My mind instantly imagined how it must have been when it was still fresh. The hut probably reminded a slaughterhouse. I checked the skull, and chuckled unable to help myself:  
   
“Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy …”   
   
“What?!” I heard Kiril outside calling me.  
   
“Nothing! All clear! Get inside.”   
   
We’ve put Batu on a bed. Kiril closed the door and we barricaded it with the table and the chest. If we wished to survive, we had to hold this hut till the sunrise, which was supposed to be any moment now. For now, we could rest. Keril moved the skull somewhere in the corner facing toward the wall.   
   
“It looks creepy” he confessed, red with embarrassment.    
   
“What, you don’t like our new company? Yorick is hurt” I smirked.   
   
“Who?” Kiril looked at me puzzled.   
   
Kiril fell quiet, looking around the hut, and I felt so tired all of a sudden. I sat on the floor leaning on a wall. For a moment nothing happened, and then I could feel the wave of nausea and fatigue washed over me. My legs filled with lead, and my back and neck ached so bad, for a second, I thought I had broken something. All my muscles cried in pain. Now when we have time to breathe both my body and my mind remind me of their neglect with interest.   
The adrenaline and will to survive blocked my fear and panic, but now… What the hell did I get myself into? Again! It was as if I attracted trouble, but damn – this time was even worse! Next what? I’ll be hunted by an interdimensional clown vampire? Dear God, what the actual FUCK?! Why me? What did I do? Just make it stop. I want to live. Just live. Is that too bloody much to ask?!  
It was as if a dam was holding a sea of raw emotion, and it went down all at once. My hand shook, and I could barely breathe – the knot formed in my throat threatening to choke me. I could only crawl into the corner, hug my knees, and just cry. I’m not proud of it. Still feel ashamed after all these years.    
   
So, while I was sobbing and feeling sorry for myself, Kiril kept his head cool and inspected the hut. If I was smarter, I would realize there was no source of light inside, and that this place should not exist. No people lived in the area.  
   
Kiril went through the chest we blocked the door with. Mostly rubbish, old rugs, ink and papers, a makeshift flint knife, and some dusty diary.   
A cool breeze came through the empty window, making me shiver. Batu decided to take a brief nap, completely exhausted during the night. No one objected to that – Batu was the only one who at least navigated in the woods, so needed him refreshed. I was jealous that I couldn’t do the same. Kiril was playing with the lighter – igniting it on and off. I was not sure what he was trying to do, and then I realized he was reading the diary we found in the chest.   
   
I couldn’t care less. It felt empty after the earlier outburst. I guess my mind just decided to shut down. I was sick and tired of everything: the woods, the creatures, Morozov and Dima. None of it mattered anymore. The only thing I wanted was to lie and sleep 72 hours straight.   
   
“Hey, you need to see this” Kiril said sternly. “Your friend over there had left us a clue. Those bastards… they can’t get away with it!”.  
   
He passed me the old diary.    
   
“We have to tell everyone!” he exclaimed. “People must know about this!”  
   
I chuckled, shaking my head. I never understood how Kiril could live that long and stay so disgustingly naïve. But he was my friend, and it's not like had many of them left. So, humoring him was the least I could do.  
   
The paper was fragile and threatened to crumble to dust any moment. The handwriting looked quaint – very neat and fancy. The letters reminded those old Pre-Revolution writings. The Old Believers who used to live here maybe?  
   
It took some effort to read it. I’ve already knew what I'd find. Kiril stared at me intently, expecting a reaction. Did he think I’d join him in the excitement of discovering some dark hidden truth?   
   
The moment I turned the first page, my hand stopped. The tingling in the back of my head returned. Some primal instinct told me there was a cold gaze laid on me. Slowly, I turned my face toward the tiny window. Kiril did the same, and we saw a face in the empty window.    
   
It looked malnourished and small, like the face of a little kid. Pale skin clung tightly to the skull like a leather mask a size too small. Two wide eyes with tiny black dots instead of the pupils. And impossibly wide smile. The creature grinned literally ear to ear, like a freakish toad, showing us a row of human teeth. The bastard stared at us never blinking once – I could see the excitement and some perverted playfulness on its face. The dots in its eyes wandered from me to Kiril and back, as if it was deciding whom it liked more. My blood froze. My limbs refused to obey no matter how loud I mentally screamed at myself.   
The thing then raised something clutched in its clawed hand – a bloodied piece of someone’s leg with a Kirza boot on it. The creature opened its mouth wide and began to chew, crunching and chomping the leg with pure undiluted happiness. Blood and pieces of meat and fabric fell down. It tore one of the toes off with its teeth and continued munching looking straight at Kiril with terrifying joy.   
   
Finally, one of us managed to break out of a trance. Batu, who was napping on the bed before, growled something menacingly in his native tongue. Then we heard a loud bang, and the face in the window disappeared.  
   
The gunshot snapped us out of our stupor. Kiril and I raised our AKs and pointed toward the door.  
   
“I thought you were watching! What the hell, people?!” Batu said angrily. “I’d never fallen asleep if I knew…”  
   
“Quite” I replied. “Hear that?”   
   
We did. The movement outside. The rustling and crutching outside – all around us. The roof was trembling under heavy steps as if someone was deliberately trying to make themselves heard. Maybe they were. Or maybe it was just an animal instinct like those raptor things from Jurassic Park. I dearly hoped so.   
They were making as much noise as possible… The snarls, the rustling, the giggles – the giggles were the worst. Did they try to intimidate us? Sent us to panic? I could tell there were at least four of the creatures lurking around the hut. Could it be more?  
My heart started pounding again, blood drumming in my ears, and my hands started shaking again but this time it was not fear. Something just snapped inside of me.  
   
“Who the fuck are you?! No one called you! Idi nakhui!” I raged clutching my gun.   
   
I was seriously through this BS. Screw those bastards, screw the forest, screw this damn hut, and especially screw those bloody maniacs from the island! Did they want a piece of me again? Uh-uh, no thank you, sir! Not this time!   
I roared.   
   
Batu and Kiril joined me howling and cussing. Kiril was shaking from fear and anger. We all were done with this. With our backs to the wall, we were akin to rats in a trap. And like any rat, there was only one thing we could do.  
   
Something rammed the door – the makeshift barricade shook and moved. The dust fell from the ceiling, and the entire hut shook as if warning us that it might not survive another hit. The door cracked a bit, and Kiril suddenly ran toward the chest.  
   
“The knife!” he screamed. “We need this knife! Where is it… Hold the door! Hold the door dammit!”  
Something hit the entrance again, widening the opening. Without thinking I throw myself at the barricade, closing the door again. I did not know why Kiril needed some old flint knife, but there was no time to ask.   
   
Batu raised his gun. I saw a flicker of movement in the window – the dark creatures were jumping back and forth like excited apes. I heard hushing whispers outside:  
   
“Come out… Come out.. wherever you are…”  

“Shut the Hell up!” I spat in return.   
   
The window was not big enough for a man to get through… but I was not so sure about these creatures. Suddenly a clawed pale hand appeared in the window and tried to grab me. I saw its sharp talons flash in front of my face. Close. Too close.   
   
Batu shot again and the gaunt hand disappeared, and we heard an insulted cry.   
   
Another hit made the hut reel. Some wood planks fell off. I stubbornly kept the door shut. Another hit. And another! Slowly, they were pushing me back. The opening grew larger and larger until I saw five long fingers slowly appearing in the opening. It playfully tapped on the door almost as if saying “Really? Are you sure?”  
The long claws didn’t fill me with optimism. The giggling and maniacal screeching outside grew louder and more excited. Batu opened fire at the door barely missing me. A small bullet hole appeared on the finger but it didn’t jerk away… Batu shot again and again, showering me with splinters like they were shrapnel. Cursing his name, I desperately pushed the door.   
Swearing like a sailor, I looked at Kiril. He was still looking for the blasted knife, kneeling on the ground. Where the hell did we put it?  
   
The creatures outside pushed again – gently, slowly, widening the opening. I saw a thin head appeared from the gap. The bastard was huge… unlike the previous “kid” this one looked more like a horse – the long face with long jaws, but I could still see the distinct human features: a small nose, tinny eyes with black dots instead of pupils, and the smile… The mouth of this one was even wider given its extended animal-like jaw, but it had the same unsettling grin – ear to ear, like a nightmarish toad. The thing looked at me with hunger and glee and then made a gesture with its index finger, like a parent who was playfully scolding a child. I raised my gun with one hand and pulled the trigger. The loud roar of the gun almost made me deaf, but even after the long burst, I still managed to hear a quiet click. The mag was empty. 30 rounds spent in less than a minute, yet still this creature stood unharmed – just a few scratches and wet gashes, that leaked some dark liquid. The bastard didn’t even flinch. In fact, its grin became even wider, and it pushed the door harder pushing me back. Its eyes were staring at my very soul.  
I growled and spat at it, then gripped my bayonet tightly. Suddenly, Kiril jumped forward – the stupid flint knife in his hands. The thing lazily moved its face toward him, and I saw its features change – the glee and happiness turned into concern.   
   
Kiril stabbed it in the eye. We heard the loud screams of panic and pain. We hurt it. We bloody hurt it! The smelly ooze pored through its severed eye socket. The thing immediately disappeared into the night, howling and crying like a puppy.   
   
“Did we do it?” I asked hopefully, reloading my AKM on reflex.   
“Yes, we did!” Kiril laughed.    
   
The next moment the door smashed into a million pieces, and the creature lunged in. The ugly bastard could barely fit into the room, scratching the ceiling with its hunched back. Fully naked, covered in some oily fluid. Nothing so big should have moved that fast! The limbs were long and crooked, and the face was deformed and enormous. It rushed at us.    
   
Its healthy eye was filled with rage and was fixed on Kiril. The long hand struck my friend in the face with such inhuman speed and force, that he flew back and smashed into the wall behind. No time to think, I opened fire again.  
The creature jumped again, headbutting me. The air left my lungs – it felt like I was hit by a tank. A heavy foot dropped on my chest pinning me to the ground, cracking my ribs. The bastard stepped on me again, and now it was grinning but not with glee or playfulness on its face. This time it was furious, and I could see a silent promise. The last few minutes of my life were going to be very… memorable.   
   
Batu kept shooting, and I was desperately trying to find the bayonet I dropped on the floor. The beast was not in a hurry and languidly ran its talon over my cheek. It looked into my eyes as if we were lovers. I could smell the foul stench from its mouth – it reeked of old sweat, rotting entrails, and unwashed teeth. Finally, my palm fell on something like a knife handle lying on the floor. No time to think I stabbed the beast’s leg that was pinning me to the ground. Suddenly, it roared. I stabbed it again and again until recoiled and released me. The flint knife was now in my arm somehow.   
   
I rushed forward bodying the creature that was lulling its injured leg. It felt like I hit a brick wall. The damn thing screamed into my face, raising its paws. In response, I stabbed it in the neck, in the belly, and its ugly face. And again. Again, and again.   
   
Blood and guts spilled on the floor, but I kept pushing and stabbing. Pushing and stabbing. I could only see red in front of me. The rage completely clouded my mind. I hated it so much: for all the horror we had to endure, for sending us into these damn woods, for running away like a coward, for letting me live while my best friend and my girlfriend died!   
   
Even when it was lying on the ground limp and motionless, I kept stabbing. Even when Batu screamed at me and the gunshot rang, I paid him no mind. Just stab. Stab. Stab. Stab.   
   
“Die, urod!” I screamed. “Die! Why don’t you die already?! Die!”   
   
I still don't know how long I was out. By the time I finally woke, I was standing over a bloody mess – the body of the creature covered in piercing wounds, its twisting guts out, blood on the floor, on the walls, and the ceiling. With some amusement, I realized it tried to crawl away, to flee to safety. The creature’s hand was half through the doorframe, desperately reaching for the woods. A terrified expression on what had left of its face. I grinned and laughed and could not stop laughing until my body hurt.   
   
“Hey, man…” said Batu cautiously. “You… Are you OK?”  
   
“No… I’m not” I muttered hysterically.   
   
Then a thought struck me.  
   
“Kiril?” I looked around.   
   
He was lying in the pool of his own blood. The head split in half and almost tore off his body.   
I looked at him for some time, then turned around and set in the corner.   
   
The creature on the floor twitched again. I looked at it with no interest. A pale bony hand reached from the darkness outside and was trying to drag the body back to the woods. I shrugged and watched until it completely disappeared into the night.   
   
We sat through the rest of the night, watching and listening silently. At some point, we heard another rustling. I hadn’t realized the sun was up until I saw Lieutenant Frolov barging in weapon raised. He looked at us with a mix of shock and relief.   
   
“What the…” he said quietly looking at the mess inside.    
   
The entire hut was covered in dark blood. So was I.  
   
“Hey, comrade lieutenant” Batu waved him from the bed awkwardly.  
   
After that, I don’t remember much. We carried Kiril’s body outside. Frolov and the rest of the platoon were looking at us funny, but they never said a word.   
   
Batu and I were sent to the hospital. The nurse was not pleased when she saw me again and protested fiercely. Lieutenant Frolov raised an eyebrow listening to her rant.   
   
“Nadia, do your job for once in your pathetic life,” he said simply. “Or do you need a lesson on what happens when you disobey an officer?”  
   
She shuddered as if Frolov slapped her face and decided not to press the issue.    
Batu’s wound got infected, so he had to stay in the hospital for another 2 weeks. My own body was covered in bruises and scratches. A couple of cracked ribs were the peak of my injuries, so the doctors decided to clear me after 3 days.   
   
During that time, a lot happened. Frolov visited and told us everything that happened while we were lost in the woods.   
   
Turned out, they found Morozov almost immediately. The idiot was hiding on a tree, scared witless. Once he saw Lieutenant Frolov approaching, he ran toward him crying like a little girl. Everyone was so relieved and pissed at Morozov, that Frolov didn’t notice our team was missing. He only realized that once the platoon gathered on the meadow where we buried the cigarette butt. Frolov could not send another search party into the woods at night. We already knew why.   
   
Frolov did something that surprised me though. He apologies. For leaving us behind, for not realizing one group was missing. I just nodded, not sure what to say. I had no strength to be mad at him for sending us, for forgetting us, for letting us die… In the end, I knew we were soldiers, not the Boy Scouts.   
   
So, Frolov continued uninterrupted. Dima was nowhere to be seen. No sight of him no matter how many search parties were sent to his last known locations. Good. I wasn’t sure if I would not empty a mag into his face.   
   
As for Kiril… the official story was he died in a bear attack. That made me angry. They could have at least said Kiril killed the bloody bear! Maybe made it as if he was protecting me and Batu – or something along those lines! Not just die like an honourless mutt… Hearing my outburst, Frolov nodded and said he’d include my statement in the report. This way Kiril would receive a medal or something. In a couple of years, he might even get a street named after him… who knows, maybe some military base even? At least someone besides 3 of us would know his name.   
   
Kiril came from an orphanage – no parents, no wife, no kids... He raised himself up from the very bottom, even secured a free spot at the University, and got a government scholarship… He didn’t deserve to die like some dirty gopnik. Kiril Krasnov – I wanted his name to matter.  
   
Lieutenant Frolov was found guilty of negligence for losing 2 soldiers and was reprimanded and demoted to Junior Lieutenant by a military tribunal. Any awards or medals he received during the war were recalled, and the severe misconduct was added to his personal file. In practice, he became a pariah, with no future in the army. He’ll be one of those “forever lieutenants” who retire at 50 with no pension or any distinctions under his name.   
   
“Are you alright, comrade lieutenant?” I asked him when he told me about the tribunal.   
   
“It's junior lieutenant, now,” he replied smiling sadly. “Don’t worry about me, soldier. You’ve got just 6 months left before the discharge. Try to stay low and don’t get into trouble, verstehen?   
   
“Yes, comrade lieutenant”  
   
He looked at me again and asked:  
   
“You wanted to ask something, soldier?”  
   
“Do I have to, comrade lieutenant?”  
   
“Junior lieutenant” he shook his head. “Shoot”  
   
“What are those things?” I said plainly.   
   
“Do you think if I knew, they would still live?” he wondered sardonically. “As far as I am aware, they lived it since… well, forever. Our colonel and all big stars prefer to not notice them. No officer likes to speak of it. For some time, we thought they just died there – there were no attacks or any incidents for many years… Well, until those assholes showed up”.  
   
“Who?” I leaned closer, feeling that I was going to receive some forbidden knowledge.   
   
“A few years ago, a team arrived from Moscow. No idea what branch they came from. GRU, FSB, MVD… hell, it could have even been the presidential FSO. Spetsnaz folks, geared for war: machine guns, RPGs, fancy new NVDs, and some serious measurement equipment. Well, they entered the forest and never came back. The whole year after that we were shitting our pants. The creatures returned in force: not a single night without an accident. The uglies even tried to enter the base. Then all calmed down again, but even still we did not risk entering the woods after dark. Some said those Spetsnaz boys turned into the creatures… I don’t know.”  
   
He fell silent.   
   
“And a hut we found?” I asked after some time.   
   
“The hell if I know” Frolov shrugged. “Never seen this one before. We don’t patrol those woods. I was as surprised as you were to find it.”  
   
“There was a diary” I remembered. “Did you read it? Kiril read it! He knew about the knife – that it could hurt them.”  
   
Frolov looked at me intently and then shook his head.  
   
“No, I didn’t see any diary nor any knives. Soldier, it would be better for everyone, if you forget this business. I sent everything we found to the colonel. Let them figure out. This shit is definitely above my and your pay grade.”   
   
Then he left.   
   
We rarely spoke with Batu about that night. Only once did he ask me something:  
   
“Did you see something… strange in the woods?” he asked uncertainly.   
   
“Like a bunch of ghouls trying to eat us?” I laughed sardonically.   
   
“No, no, I mean, when we left the hut.”  
   
“I… I don’t know. I don’t remember much after Frolov found us.”  
   
Batu nodded and muttered:  
   
“Maybe it’s nothing… When we were leaving, I think I saw someone. Near the hut. Some old man. Then I turned and he disappeared”.  
   
“Lemmy guess, black robe, long beard, and a fancy hat?”  
   
“Maybe?” he looked at me worryingly. “Do you know who that was?”   
   
“Maybe” I shrugged.   
   
So, the life went on. Both Batu and I were released from the hospital and our service continued as if nothing had happened.   
   
One morning we saw a UAZ and a truck arriving at our base. The driver was just another conscript, but the passengers were definitely not. A lean captain in the old field uniform walked into HQ. This was odd. By that time, we already knew all the officers on the base, but this guy… He didn’t look like a typical paper pusher from the Division HQ. Firstly, he wasn’t cleanly shaved and had a slight bristle on the face – that was a severe misconduct in our colonel's eyes. Secondly, his chevrons were unknown to me, and Frolov had mercilessly drilled us to recognize all the chevrons from our Siberian Military District.   
   
Soon we learned why. A fat praporshik arrived in the barracks and ordered the company to move out.   
   
Our platoon was shepherded to HQ building where we found Frolov waiting for us near the entrance. He came to each of us, saying very quietly: “Play dumb. And don’t sign anything”. Well, now I was officially in a panicking mode. One by one we were invited into the colonel's office. There I learned the newcomer’s name: Major Vladimir Volkov of the 135th Motor Rifle Regiment, 58th Army.   
   
I didn’t like Volkov one bit. He had a face fitting his last name: like a wolf, he had keen eyes and a silent threat on a seemingly relaxed face. I could almost feel how his cold grey eyes were penetrating my very soul. He was evaluating me like I was prey or worse. I’ve stared into the eyes of the beasts, madmen, and maniacs before, but his calculating look unnerved me much more.   
   
He asked very basic questions: What was the life before the army? How do I feel? What do I think of Motherland?  
   
Nothing specific really, so I replied honestly not knowing what to expect.   
   
“Life before the army was great”.   
“I’m feeling alright”.   
“I don’t have particularly warm feelings towards the Motherland, and I am pretty sure it's mutual.”  
   
He laughed drily at the last one and then asked:  
   
“Got yourself into a bit of trouble, heh? Got yourself shot, then got lost in the woods, attacked by a bear” Volkov smirked drily.  “How are you holding up?”  
   
“I’m fine… according to the nurse”.  
   
“And according to you?”  
   
“Hurt like hell, but I’m alright”.  
   
He nodded and looked at the documents: my psychological profile, my physical records, and my training results. He didn’t say anything just nodded putting my file away.  
The others in my company went through the same procedure  
   
Two weeks later, Batu, me, and 122 other lucky winners from our regiment were packing our stuff again. We were transferred to our new unit – Major Volkov’s 1st battalion of the 135th Motor Rifle Regiment. Our train was heading to a fun little town named Prokhladny. The worst part? It was right next to Chechnya where the war raged for the last 20 years. The whole Caucasus region was a giant thorn in the Russian backside since the 18th century, and the recent war was just another escalation. I watched the news about the Chechen Wars when I was a child and those were some horror stories that kept me awake at night. 
   
Before we left for our old base, Lieutenant Frolov talked to me and Batu:   
   
“Listen closely, soldiers, don’t play heroes. Look after each other. Trust your commander – but don’t expect any help from the higher-ups. You die there and no one will even bother to bury you, except your mates. And for the love of God don’t tell your parents – a heart stroke is not fun, trust me. Oh, and the last thing: grab every single piece of ammo you can get your dirty little hands on. I don’t care how: beg, threaten, or steal. You’ll need it.”   
   
The whole trip was like another dream. I was sure, that we’d get ourselves killed on the first patrol. The entire train was like a silent funeral procession – everyone was grim as if they already prepared their last testament.
