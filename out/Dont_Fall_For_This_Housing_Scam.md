I had always wanted to move out of my parents' house. I am a child of eight and not having to come home to my siblings wailing, mum and dad screaming and the strain of sharing two bathrooms between ten people was an everlasting, yet unrealistic dream.

One day, after working my routine eleven hour shift at work, I clambered up the crusted carpet floors and collapsed onto my rigid mattress. It was a ritual at this point. I had come to terms that the only accommodation I could afford would be a house share. I typed 'cheapest places to rent near me' into my browser app and as usual, I was disappointed to see that the potential options were neither near me nor were they cheap.

This time it was different though.

As I sorted by 'lowest price first,' I saw a listing uploaded twelve seconds ago. An image of an alluring, modern home flashed before me and I barely caught a glimpse of the price before the post vanished. The mental image I snapped convinced me that the price was £120 a month. Considering the lowest price I had seen before then was £700, I put it down to either a technical glitch or a mental glitch caused by my sleep-deprived mind.

I just couldn't get the image of that house out of my mind though. It was a romantical obsession. The house was plastered in my vision every time I closed my eyes. I would spend every waking second thinking about it and every tireless night dreaming about it. I just hoped what I had seen was real or whether this desperation was driving me to insanity.

There was so much more about the house I wanted to discover. Where was it located? Was the rent really £120 a month? How many people share it? These were all questions that would remain unanswered unless I could see that house again.

My father had been fighting an ongoing battle with cancer for four years. Between the countless chemotherapy treatments, we were starting to realise he was fighting a losing battle. Before his diagnosis, he worked as a car salesman. We wouldn't see him much as he was committed to putting food on the table for his wife and eight children. That responsibility had now been passed on to my two brothers. I helped out where I could but I knew moving out would be a huge financial burden lifted from their shoulders. It would also let me escape the stirring pot of depression engrained in the house.

I was beginning to lose hope though. Perhaps I was destined to inherit the pain and suffering from my parents and continue living a life of hope. I was thinking about whether I really was losing my mind over a house or if it was more the prospect of starting a new life. Weeks of my laborious life continued and my daily scrolling never amounted to anything more than disappointment.

Then one night it happened. I saw it. The same exact image. The same image that had burrowed it's way into my brain since I first saw it. It was real!

I forced myself out of the shackles of excitement to screenshot the image. I couldn't lose it again. I tapped into the post and scrolled down taking screenshots like a deranged ex-girlfriend collecting ammunition for an argument. When the post vanished, there was a conflicting feeling of knowing the opportunity may be gone forever but that I had everything I needed to answer my questions. Then the post came back. I quickly went back into paparazzi mode and then the post vanished again like it was never there.

I rummaged through my camera roll to begin the inspection process.

The property was truly astonishing. I spent a few minutes admiring the architectural efforts that were put into the construction of it. It wasn't an exotic mansion by any means but it looked homely and I could see my self living there for the rest of my life if I had to.

The next image I captured showed the monthly rent. This would determine whether my future would be filled with hope or dismay. I was so nervous that I covered the number with my hand and slowly peeled my wrist back to reveal my destiny. Sure enough there it was. Clear as day, £120 a month. I clutched the phone to my chest and felt the device pounding in my hands to the crescendoing rhythm of my heart.

I scrolled to the next image and saw the address. 12 Foley Street. That was a 40 minute bike ride from where I lived. It wasn't the closest property I had seen advertised but if I was less than an hour cycle ride away from a brand new life, I was more than satisfied.

The next image showed the description of the property. It was deserted except for a phone number and email address. It was strange that a house with such a low monthly rent would have no additional information at all but I was relieved to know that even though the post was no longer there, I had some form of communication with the landlord.

I kept scrolling and saw a screenshot where the post wasn't advertised. That must have been where it vanished temporarily. I scrolled onto the next image and there it was again in all its glory. Truly breath taking.

But this time, something was different. The price had changed. It now read £118 a month. Confusion washed over me. That's weird. I kept scrolling and everything else was identical to the previous listing except for the price. I called the number but it was no longer in service. I sent a barrage of email enquiries and never got a response back.

Determined to uncover the full truth, I decided to track down anyone who had lived there before. After hours of scouring social media and stumbling across a blog, I found a name: Laura Evans. She was listed as a former tenant who had mysteriously moved out less than a day after moving in. I reached out to her, hoping for a response, and to my surprise, she replied almost immediately.

"You're looking at the house on Foley Street, aren't you?" her message began. My fingers trembled as I typed back a confirmation.

Laura agreed to meet at a nearby café, and her urgency was palpable. When we met, her eyes were wide with a mixture of fear and relief. She wasted no time in recounting her experience.

"The house is cursed," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I moved in because the rent was so cheap, like you. Everything seemed perfect at first, but then I started noticing strange things. Footsteps at night, voices from the vents. You know the usual horror move shit."

Laura explained that she had done some digging. She found out about the house's dark history and its role as a sacrificial ground. The rent, always absurdly low, dropped by one pound for each soul taken within its walls. She said the craziest part was when she stumbled upon an old diary hidden in the attic, belonging to a previous tenant who documented similar occurrences before mysteriously vanishing.

"I was lucky to escape," she said, her voice shaking. "As soon as I stepped in, I felt this overwhelming urge to leave. I took my things and ran. Never looked back. When I saw the rent drop by another pound a week later, I knew I had to help people so I started the blog."

She finished off her coffee and let out a huge sigh as she reclined back into her seat.

We parted ways and I headed home and crashed down onto my mattress which felt a little bit softer than it always had. My siblings cries rang through my ears like a familiar lullaby. I pulled out my phone and had a message from Laura. "Thanks for coming and hearing my story. I really enjoyed today. You free next week? x"

I went to my photos app and started scrolling through the same images that I had spent so long obsessing over. I admired the picture of the house one last time and reluctantly sent it to the digital landfill. Then my phone started ringing and it seemed to be vibrating with a strange urgency. I recognised the number immediately as it was the same one in the image of the property description box on my screen.
