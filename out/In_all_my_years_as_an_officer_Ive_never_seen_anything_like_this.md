Case Number: 03011984

Date: February 8, 2023

Reporting Officer: Deputy Blackwell

Prepared By: Deputy Blackwell

Incident Type: Missing Persons/Possible Kidnapping

Address of Occurrence: 557 Maple Street

Witnesses:

Julie Mitchelle: Waitress - Steven's Bistro, 23, Caucasian

Phillip Neman - 911 Call operator, 42, African American

On February 8, 2023, at around 18:45, Steven Wilson and his wife, Carla Wilson, were seen arriving at Steven's Bistro. It was reported by their waitress, Julie Mitchelle, the couple were having a hostile dinner that included yelling and abrupt banging on the table. Ms. Mitchelle says she had to ask the couple multiple times to keep their voices down. Ms. Mitchelle reports that the couple eventually calmed down and finished their meal quietly, leaving the restaurant around 20:00.

It is presumed the couple drove straight to their home at 557 Maple Street. At approximately 20:23, a person identifying themselves as Carla Wilson contacted 911 Emergency Services. The operator she spoke to, Phillip Neman, reported that Mrs. Wilson stated in her call that an unknown woman was standing in her driveway. Mr. Neman says he instructed Mrs. Wilson to stay on the line and in her vehicle. During their conversation, Mr. Neman could hear Mrs. Wilson interact with an unidentified male, believed to be Mr. Wilson.

At approximately 20:26, Mr. Neman reported that Mrs. Wilson screamed. When asked what prompted this, she said that their babysitter, Ms. Rebecca Wells, had come outside and startled them. Mrs. Wilson then stated that the unknown woman was no longer in sight. Mrs. and Mr. Wilson instructed their babysitter to go inside. Mr. Neman said that the Wilsons had a private conversation that Mr. Neman couldn't hear. It was at this point, 20:30, that Mrs. Wilson hung up. Mr. Neman tried calling her back, but no one answered.

The events that transpired from the ending of the 911 call and when I, Deputy Blackwell, arrived are unknown. I came to the residence of Mr. Steven Wilson and Carla Wilson at 557 Maple Street at approximately 20:37. I exited my cruiser and approached the carport of the Wilson's home, where the intruder was initially reported. On inspection of the driveway, I didn't observe any person or persons as reported to 911. I did observe an unattended vehicle, a 2011 Hyundai Elantra. I noticed the side door to the home was ajar. I announced myself and knocked on the door.

After hearing no response, I entered the residence of 557 Maple Street at approximately 20:42. Upon entering the residence, I noticed no lights in the house and removed my flashlight. After activating my flashlight, I shined the light around the home's doorway as I entered the home. I continued shining the light about the house but did not observe any sign of disturbance. I continued my way into the living room, where I witnessed 5 people seated in the living room.

I once again announced myself, but again, received no response. I approached the 5 seated people and announced myself a final time. As I reached the 5 seated persons, I observed two younger males, later identified as Bennet Wilson and Hutton Wilson, and two females, Carla Wilson and Rebecca Wells. The 5th person was Steven Wilson. The 5 people were seated upright with their eyes and mouths open. I attempted to contact any of the 5 people but received no response. I didn't observe any outward wounds or signs of distress on the people. I noticed that, except for Mr. Wilson, none of the other people appeared to be breathing.

At approximately 20:51, I requested additional emergency services to render aid. After I got off the radio with emergency services, I attempted to contact Mr. Wilson. He seemed non-responsive until I shined my flashlight into his eyes, at which point Mr. Wilson screamed and attacked me.

I was forced to subdue him. Mr. Wilson seemed confused about where he was. He kept asking who I was and where he was. After handcuffing Mr. Wilson, I stood up and noticed the 4 other people were now standing up. Their mouths and eyes were wide open, and their hands were raised defensively. All of them shared the same pose. Mr. Wilson continued to scream, and I asked him to remain silent and to tell his family to sit down. Mr. Wilson insisted his family was upstairs. I told him they were standing around him. Mr. Wilson seemed confused and stated he didn't see them. I tried to make contact with Mrs. Wilson, but she was non-responsive.

I became aware of a presence in the far corner of the room. An older unidentified woman. I cannot confirm if she had always been standing there or had arrived in my subduing of Mr. Wilson. I shined my light on the woman and took a few steps in her direction. She remained in the same static pose as the others. I returned my attention to the Wilson family, who had all collectively turned and were now facing my direction. I removed my taser and instructed them to lie face down. None of them complied. I was unsure of how to proceed in the presence of minors. I backed up to keep the woman and the 4 people in my view. The woman had inched closer in my direction while I had moved my focus to the Wilsons. Since she was separate from the children, I instructed the woman to drop to her knees and put her hand behind her head. Mr. Wilson began screaming that the woman was not human and was a danger. I asked Mr. Wilson to control his outburst and remain silent. The woman refused to comply.

I admit I had reservations about approaching the woman, given the lack of lighting and the unusual nature of the call. I pointed my taser at the woman and gave her a final warning to comply. The woman didn't move, so I fired my taser. It seems to have no effect on the woman. I attempted another electrical surge in the taser, but my flashlight malfunctioned momentarily and went dark. I tapped the light on the wall, and when it came back on, the woman and the 4 people near the sofa had all gotten closer to me. I felt that I was being backed into a corner and attempted to use the taser a third time. My flashlight malfunctioned once again, but when I banged the flashlight against the wall, the light remained off. I dropped the taser and tried to get the flashlight working again. After a few moments, the light came on, and I was face-to-face with the woman. She was a foot from my face.

The 4 people from the sofa also encircled me. They weren't moving and remained in the same frozen position. I removed my firearm and instructed them to back away. Again, there was non-compliance from the 5 people. I instructed Mr. Wilson to ask his family to step back for safety. Mr. Wilson again insisted no one was in the room with us. I told him to stop playing games if he wanted his family to remain safe. Mr. Wilson became distraught and said it was too late for that. I forcibly shoved the unknown woman away and raised my firearm. The woman didn't budge or react. I demanded she back away. Still no reaction. My flashlight began to flicker. I dreaded what was about to happen. The light went off, and the room went black, but then yellow flashing lights illuminated the house as the ambulance arrived. I see the woman stare right back at me. With every flash of yellow, she seemed to move an inch closer in the darkness until her cold skin touched mine.

The front door opened, and the lights from the ambulance flooded the house. I was temporally blinded as my eyes adjusted. The EMT, Samantha Wayne, asked me to lower my weapon. I told her I couldn't because of the threat of the people around me. The EMT asked what people? As my eyes adjusted, I could no longer see the woman or the 4 others. I told the EMT to remain outside until the premises could be secured. I again searched the house but could find no sign of the woman, the Wilson family, or the babysitter. Once I determined the house to be secure, I allowed the EMT to come in and examine Mr. Wilson. He had become unresponsive. The EMT took his vitals and said he appeared to be in shock. Mr. Wilson was transported to St. Michaels Hospital. He is under supervision and has currently, as of this time, continued to be non-responsive. The whereabouts of the remaining Wilson family, Ms. Wells, and the unknown woman are still being investigated.
