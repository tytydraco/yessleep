This is a legend whispered to those who dare to explore forgotten places. Years ago, a group of teenagers, fuelled by youthful bravado, ventured into a cave on the other side of this lake. It was a labyrinth of darkness. The air hung heavy, thick with the smell of damp earth and.... something else â€“ something ancient, unsettling, and unknown. The cave's deathly silence was broken only by the drip-dripping of unseen water.

Armed with torches, their contagious laughter bounced off the cavern walls until they reached a narrow passage. One by one, they squeezed through, their bravado fading fast with each step deeper into the unknown. The air grew colder, the silence heavier.

Suddenly, a bloodcurdling scream shattered the stillness. Panic surged through their frozen bodies before a jolt of reality sent them scrambling back. Their torches cast grotesque shadows on the cave's uneven walls. In the frantic scramble, a young woman named Sarah tripped. Her torch tumbled, plunging them into utter darkness.

A collective, fearful gasp filled the air, followed by a strained silence. Then, a whisper, faint yet distinct, echoed through the cavern: "Help me."

This was not something you'd want to hear in the darkness of a cave. Fear threatened to consume them, but Sarah, with a trembling voice, called out, "Where are you?"

A reply came closer this time, close enough to feel the chill of their unknown guest's breath on the side of her face. "Here." it said.

As they strained to see in the suffocating darkness, a clammy hand, bone-white and luminous, materialized from the shadows. Five icy fingers grasped at the air, stretched out towards them. Shrieks tore through the darkness as they fumbled for dear life. Their eyes, now slightly accustomed to the dark, could see a white hand hanging in mid-air for a horrifying moment before vanishing as abruptly as it appeared.

Panic seized them, and they fled the cave, each teenager scrambling to find a steady footing, vowing never to return.

One by one, they emerged from the cave into the fresh lakeside air. A quick headcount revealed Sarah was still missing. "Sarah!" they screamed into the cave, "Sarah, where are you?" But Sarah never replied.

The teenagers, too scared to return for her, ran as fast as they could to the nearest police station. There, they recounted their terrifying escape from the unknown icy hand and their missing friend.

In the morning light, the police arrived at the scene. Sarah's parents, hysterically crying, awaited a glimmer of hope that would never arrive. The rescue team emerged from the cave, their faces black with dirt, and revealed there was no trace of anything or anyone inside.

To this day, Sarah has never been seen again. Some say if you hold your ear close to the lake's surface, you can still hear her asking, "Where are you?" But some places hold secrets best left undisturbed. The darkness holds more than just shadows, and sometimes, a helping hand might not be what it seems.
