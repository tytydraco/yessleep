I’ve always felt people’s emotions as if they were my own. Not just moods—joy, fear, pain crash into me like a tidal wave, twisting my thoughts. I thought it was a gift, a way to understand others. But nine days ago, I moved into this rotting house, and a man I met broke my mind. Now I’m trapped, drowning in his madness, and I’m not sure I’m still me. I came here for silence after the city’s chaos, but instead, I found a nightmare that’s swallowing me whole.

The house is old, its wooden frame groaning like it’s alive. The air smells of damp rot, and the windows rattle without wind. From the first night, I felt something off—mirrors in the bathroom showed my reflection a heartbeat too late, and the air pressed against my empathic senses like a cold hand. I blamed exhaustion, years of absorbing strangers’ feelings. But the house wasn’t the problem. It was him.

Last Wednesday, I walked past an abandoned church a mile from the house, its steeple sagging like a broken bone. A man sat on a bench, still as death, staring into nothing. His face was calm, but his emotions hit me like a knife—jagged, fractured, not human. People’s feelings are usually vivid, warm or sharp, but his were a shattered mirror, reflecting something wrong. I tried to pass by, but he turned and whispered, “They see you through the walls. You feel them too, don’t you?” His voice was a cold rasp, like gravel on a coffin lid.

I froze, legs rooted. He grabbed my wrist, and his mind surged into mine—sharp, broken, a storm of dread. He spoke of “watchers,” shadows that followed him, lived in his thoughts. Then I saw them—a flash, like a scream in my skull: black, faceless silhouettes behind him, eyeless but staring. I tore free, heart pounding, and ran home, telling myself my empathy was playing tricks. But his madness clung to me.

Sleep stopped that night. I hear his voice in my head, whispering about watchers, his words looping like a broken record. Footsteps echo behind locked doors, slow and deliberate, like bare feet on wet wood. Sometimes, I see him in my bedroom corner—not a shadow, but him, his dead eyes fixed on me. I turn on the light, and he’s gone, but the air grows heavier, thick with his fractured emotions. The bathroom mirror is worse: my reflection lags, and his face flickers behind mine, his lips moving silently. His thoughts—cold, alien, like frost on my soul—bleed into mine, unraveling who I am.

Yesterday, I tried to escape. I packed a bag, stumbled to the car, but the engine was dead. Back inside, the attic door was ajar, though I’d bolted it shut. The air up there stank of rot, and I found scratches on the floor—long, claw-like marks, too thin for a human. I barricaded myself downstairs, but his voice grew louder, his emotions drowning me. He wasn’t just in my head—he was in the house, his presence seeping through the walls.

This morning, I found a note on the kitchen table, scrawled in my handwriting, though I didn’t write it: “He knows who you are. You’re his now.” I lunged for the front door, but the lock jammed, the handle ice-cold. The room darkened, lightbulbs flickering as his voice filled my head, louder, commanding. I hid in the corner, but his emotions consumed me—jagged, endless, pulling me apart. My reflection in the window showed his face over mine, his dead eyes merging with my own. I fought to hold onto myself, but his mind was stronger. I felt my thoughts shatter, my body grow weightless, as if I was no longer flesh.

I’m not me anymore. His madness took me, rewrote me. I see through his eyes now, feel the watchers he spoke of, their eyeless faces part of me. The house is quiet, but I’m not alone—I’m him, or what’s left of him. I’m writing this as my last act, my hand trembling, his voice guiding my words. He knows you’re reading. His cold reaches through these words, searching for you. If you feel a chill, if your reflection hesitates, he’s already there. Don’t look in the mirrors. Don’t look back.
