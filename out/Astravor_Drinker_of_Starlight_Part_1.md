There’s a hush that hangs after midnight in the waters of the Everglades–a silence that isn’t truly silent, threaded with the constant, murmuring chorus of crickets and frogs[.](http://scottsavino.com/the-drinker-of-starlight) They keep time, measuring the slow, rhythmic breath of night as it passes.

I wake, but not in the boathouse where I remember being chained... bound to a support beam by rusty shackles that scraped my bones each time I moved. I glance down, rubbing my wrists where the soreness still lingers. My skin feels bruised and raw and...different, somehow.

Did I escape? How? Or was I…left here?

I look around. The air is thick, dense with warm, damp dark–a wet heaviness I swallow down with each slow breath, tasting faintly of ancient bark and earth. My clothes are soaked, clinging to me, heavy with muck from the water that lies everywhere around me. My arms and legs are streaked with mud.

Did I swim here? Drag myself across these waters, using the last shreds of strength I didn’t know I had? The thought is impossible–but then, so is waking up alone, unbound.

For days I grew weaker–given only water to drink. But soon that wasn’t enough, and my limbs trembled as hunger gnawed at me. They ignored my hoarse pleas:

*"For the love of God, I need something to eat."*

They ignored me most of the time, absorbed by working on their–thing. I don’t know what to call it, whatever it was. They didn’t speak to me much, but the one that did seemed to have a limited grasp of English and the other one…he didn’t speak to me at all.

Now here I am, on this tiny island, as if I’d crawled up from the mud like some swamp creature, my back pressed to the knotted roots of a cypress to keep from sinking into the soft earth below.

There’s something strange that has been bothering me since I opened my eyes. Of course the fact that I’d been held captive for a week by two thin swamp hillbillies with hollow, sunken eyes bothers me…and that I woke up here, on this muddy island bothers me too; but that’s not what I mean. Something else entirely has been bothering me–it’s a feeling that has been persistently gnawing at me, telling me that something is different–just a little bit off from how it’s supposed to be–changed. Something’s changed.

It’s been there since I opened my eyes, and only now can I place it: there’s plenty of moonlight, the stars uncommonly bright, but beneath the arms and leaves of the canopy above, so little of that light reaches me...yet, in the dimness all around, where every shadow should be shrouded and vague, menacing...I don’t feel anxious or afraid, because despite the darkness, I can see perfectly.

How strange.

Should I feel this calm? The only feeling that seems to have any hold over me is hunger, and that feeling is strong. So, so strong, and I've only just noticed it now, when the thought of it was brought to mind. I think I should be traumatized, maybe? Something like that? After being kidnapped and held for over a week without being given anything to eat, shouldn’t I feel damaged? Out in the open in the Everglades without any sort of camping or survival gear, shouldn’t I be feeling something? Anything but hunger?

Has being in the swamp after nightfall ever bothered me? No. I don’t think it has. Not the endless press of black water or the sound of ripples as things move darkly, dangerously, just beneath the surface. Even the strange chorus of voices in the night closing in around me fails to be a problem.

Before those men–stretched out as long and elastic as rubber bands, with their smoldering, flame-like skin and reed-thin, bony arms–took me to their little lair, I’d come out here to stay. I’d come here for a reason–a purpose. I’d been meant to do something out here at night. 

*Why? What was I doing?*

A sound rises faintly, and I realize immediately how uncommonly quiet it is. I shouldn’t hear it at all above the shrill twitching of crickets or the discordant croaking all around me. A wall of sound penetrated by this whisper of movement, like feathers brushing paper. It should be hidden and I know that I shouldn’t hear it–but I hear it anyway, even pinpointing that it’s coming from somewhere to my left. I turn my head.

It’s a moth. Why does it seem so familiar? Do I know this moth? Have we met?

No, that’s not it at all. Close. But that’s not it. Something about it is connected to the thing I’d been trying to recall before I heard it.

The memory is there, lurking on the frayed edges of my mind like a nightmare, quickly faded and forgotten. It’s still half-asleep in my mind, and I want to shake it awake so it can tell me the secrets it keeps–the things I want to know. But it’s just out of reach.

The moth moves toward me, stopping to hover. Waiting. Watching. I feel the urge to follow it rising like an instinct that belongs to someone else, so I climb to my feet. As soon as I do, it flutters further. I pause, so as not to startle it, and it circles back to face me, waiting again, so I release any hesitation and follow. The moth doesn’t stray far; it leads me to the edge of a small clearing, where a gnarled, twisted, and rotting trunk rises from the damp ground, its roots knotted in thick coils reaching down into the mud.

There, clinging to the trunk just above my head, is a fragile bloom. A small white flower, the roots reaching down, coiling into the bark and holding it aloft so it seems to float midair, swaying on the breeze. The contrast of the white petals glow like a specter in the gloom of the night.

*Ghost orchid.*

*Giant sphinx moth.*

The memory is finally awake. This is why I’d come out here. Before those men found me, I’d come out here alone with scent traps and night-vision cameras to track these orchids and these moths, to study how often the insects visited to pollinate, to find out if any factors in the environment were disrupting their patterns. It was work for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.

*My name is Elara Knox. I am a botanist. There are between 1,500 and 2,000 of these orchids left in the wild. This flower is endangered.*

Wait–had I forgotten all of that and only remembered now? Even my own name? What had those men done to me? Everything I should remember–things I should know about myself–it’s all still there. I can feel it. But it teeters, misplaced on the edges of forgetting. Rearranged into corners where it doesn’t belong. Making sense of the fragments as I discover them and pull them to the surface is a daunting task. Daunting, but not impossible. Everything I am is still here, trapped in the clutches of forgetting and I just have to jar it loose…

>*When they found my tent just before dawn, I was lying down to sleep. Their skin had been so hot it scorched the nylon when they snatched the tent’s doorway seam and yanked the zipper open. Their hands were like burning skillets when they grabbed me from my sleeping bag and dragged me out into the growing purple of dawn as it crawled to life on the edge of the horizon. The shorter one was in charge. He wore muddy overalls without a shirt beneath, and he made the taller one put the rust-pocked shackles on my wrists.*

>*I screamed and screamed, and neither one of them ever said a word to me. The taller one just slung the opposite end of the chain over his shoulder, the bony blade attached to it as large and round as a serving platter. It stuck out beneath his stained undershirt with a striking, strange prominence. A strange smell hung in the air around them–familiar, yet I didn’t have the words to describe it at first–but then, it began to remind me of something I knew. It smelled like the frayed cord of something that should have been unplugged immediately…of melting microchips. They smelled like a pair of electrical fires.*

>*The taller one, with one hand plunged deep into his pocket and the other clutching a fistful of corroded chain links, moved with the casual posture of a man on a leisurely walk with his small dog as he pulled me. He followed behind the shorter one leading the way deeper into the swamp.*

>*The taller of the two made no sound as we traveled through the swamp, yet the smaller one spoke excited and animatedly the entire time. He kept his voice low, the sound of it like the speaking whisper of a rat. Quietly, so as to prevent me from hearing he muttered strange things to other as they walked. Most of those things sounded like words in an unfamiliar language. In truth, I'm unsure of that assumption because I never heard a single syllable clearly enough to make sense of it, screaming at the top of my lungs for help as they pulled me along. I knew there was nobody around for miles to hear, but I screamed my head off anyway. *

\________________

The moth flutters over the orchid, as though allowing me to take in its details before it will finally alight and I accept its strange invitation.

The thin white petals stretch outward, yawning open in thin, ghostly curls. It sways almost imperceptibly, breathing with the night, its pale petals drinking in the hints of moonlight until it seems to glow with it. The air around it carries a fragrance of sweet decay, something once dead, hauntingly brought back to life.

The moth lands, folding its wings, painted in patterns like shattered glass. It reflects against the dark like distant starlight as its silvery, soft body shimmers and finally settles. Its mirrored black eyes seem to stare back at me, and the feathered antennae on its head flex, feeling the texture of the orchid’s surface.

Unbidden and moving without my command, I watch in indescribable horror as my hand moves through the darkness with the silent speed of an owl descending from above. My fingers wrap quickly around both moth and orchid, tearing the flower away from the tree trunk, roots and all. The movement is quick, yet so delicately precise that I’m able to clutch both the flower and the moth in my fist without crushing either, feeling the insect squirm against my palm.

My mouth opens in a wide, hungry yawn, and I stuff both the moth and the orchid into the back of my throat, swallowing them whole.

I’d searched for one of these ghost orchids for over a week before the men found me. This was an important find: a rare and delicate endangered species, I’d come out here to study…

…and I’ve just swallowed it instead.

I don’t know what came over me. The Hunger was so strong, I couldn’t help myself.

The eerie calm I felt when I first awoke has fled–but it also still clings to me, like a strange duality. A part of me wants to vomit. But another part, a second self, seems to have watched all of this happen from within, uncaring. I feel both because I am both, perhaps?

I would never have done this willingly, yet I just watched my hand do it on its own, following the command to feed, given by something wordless and unknown in the dark. This hunger isn’t mine, but it is inside me. It doesn’t belong to me–it feels like a passenger, something with no name or shape, existing in all directions at once.

It is endless. Boundless.

Limitless.

And just like it, I feel boundless too. The Hunger takes no single form because it needs none. Just as I need none…

The act of consuming the orchid fills me with an odd lightness, a release of pressure, and the heaviness that I felt in the pit of my empty stomach seems to lift. But then, a moment later, it returns twice as strong. I am moving again, toward the water’s edge without telling my body to move, drawn to the soft light of fireflies gathered in the reeds.

This time I watch without horror, only detached fascination, as my hand darts through the air, snatching and swallowing them one by one. The Hunger ebbs and flows, like a pulse, each time I catch one and swallow. The memory of the orchid drifts from my mind, and I become consumed by the need to feed.

Eating the fireflies affects The Hunger differently somehow.

*“They sate themselves on both: life a morsel and light a feast, Astravor…”* a ghostly voice whispers from somewhere close by, startling me. Is there someone else out here? One of those strange men? Both of them? 

Watching me?

“Hello?” I call out, my voice cracking slightly. It couldn’t be the voice of the shorter man. His was high pitched and the voice I've just heard was like a low rumble–an avalanche of stones rolling off the face of a cliff in the dark. It may be the taller man; I never heard him speak.

Two feelings strike at once: I am both calm, oddly unafraid, and horrified by the thought that someone might be out here with me in the dark. The sensation of both is a strange dichotomy, and I find the commingling of these states slightly soothing yet also deeply unsettling. These emotions–conflicting, binary–cohabitate within me, existing together in a quiet, alien harmony.

I wade into the thick mud at the water’s edge, drawn by the instinct of the Passenger within me, out into the dark, glittering water where the reflection of the moon floats distantly, waiting.

\________________

>*They dragged me behind them, the shorter one quickening his pace as the sun begins to crest the horizon, and the tall one matches his speed with a fluid, eerie ease. I realize our destination is a boathouse, hidden deep at the swamp’s edge. Layers of faded paint peel from its warped walls, curling in thin strips that mimic the bark of the cypress that surround it. It’s camouflaged, forgotten, nestled in the swamp like something waiting to be uncovered.*

>*When we reach the door, the shorter one stops and turns to me, his orange eyes gleam with a strange excitement. They seem to hold a light of their own, burning in his hollow, sunken face. He reaches out to touch my arm, and his fingers press against my skin with unbearable, scorching heat. I flinch back instinctively, and he withdraws his hand immediately, raising it as if in apology.*

>*“They are one. They? One. Yet, also many,” he says, his high-pitched croak of a voice jarring against his appearance. He says it without breaking eye contact, and the words hang there, cryptic and strange, as though they have a meaning I am meant to understand. Something in his voice, and those seemingly random words feel deliberate. I don't understand what he's trying to tell me but those words feel violating, as though he’s intentionally reached into a part of me I hadn’t intended to share.*

>*He glances at the tall one. “They are perfect. A vessel,” he murmurs. He pulls the door open on creaking, rusty hinges. The first pale shaft of morning sunlight breaks over the horizon, slanting through the trees, and casts the faintest glow across the door’s surface. I watch, confused and dazed, as the light stretches toward the short man’s hand where he grips the door, and the moment it makes contact, he hisses, jerking that hand away.*

>*A thick plume of smoke rises from his skin where the light touched him, curling into the air. Staring, wide-eyed and bewildered, I immediately link this phenomenon with the unsettling length of their torsos and limbs. This is the first moment I consider that these men might be something other than human.*

>*“Inside! Quick! Quickly!” he snaps to the taller one, voice sharpening with urgency. “The star awakens!”*

At first, I entered the swamp only because my feet were moving through the mud on their own, as if controlled by something else–the Hunger, my Passenger. It pulled me toward the moonlight, and something strange about that distant reflection haunting the water stirred within me like a shadow, dark and unsettling. I couldn’t put my finger on it right away, but I felt the other parts of me drawn to it too, unable to say why. When my curiosity took hold of my thoughts and the desire to keep swimming toward the light rose within me, The Hunger released its grip on my body, and I found my arms and legs freed to move by my own will. I kept drawing closer to it then without being forced.

After crossing the water of my own accord for several minutes, I understood what felt so wrong. That elusive, unsettling quality I’d sensed was finally clear: getting closer to the reflection of the moon wasn’t physically possible, and yet here I was, defying logic and science, watching that pale circle of light swell as I drew nearer.

I understand physics well enough to know this: the reflection of the moon should follow the same laws of perspective as everything else, shifting as I move, always receding, just out of reach. Any glimpse of it on the water’s surface is only an illusion. It doesn’t actually exist where I see it–that’s just a trick of light and distance. No matter how close I try to get, it should remain a fixed distance from me, mirroring my every move toward it, slipping away.

And yet, within minutes, the image of the moon sits buoyantly on the black surface of open water at the center of the glade, and I find myself treading water within its circle of light.

*“They are hollow, and hollow things must fill themselves, Astravor. Drink the glimmer.”* The voice, like a tremor in the shadows beneath the surface, low and laden, churns up as if from the mud deep below. 

I put my lips to the water, drawing in a mouthful of foul, stagnant muck.

The voice laughs, a mirthful murmur that bleeds forth from the marrow of the night. Reverberating through the shadowed trees, echoing, rippling across the water like distant thunder.

*“The water is a darkness drink. They drink of the glow for the glow is theirs alone.”*

I try to speak, to tell the voice I don’t understand, but the only part that escapes my lips is the beginning of a word before The Hunger takes hold of me again. Demonstrating, it purses my lips, drawing in breath, slowly–deeply, slurping at the open air around me. My chin moves slowly from left to right, and as it does, the light begins to rise from the surface of the water. The reflection of the moon’s luster, in thin tendrils, passes between my lips, warm and slightly damp. I feel it slide down, down, and down my throat as I swallow in long, successive gulps, each one feeding the warmth into me, like sunlight wrapped in silk. 

The taste is full and deep–swallowing the incandescence of pure energy, melting through me in a slow, simmering pleasure that spreads outward from within, tracing warmth along my veins.

Within moments, the moon still shines above, but its image, once cast against the waters of the Everglades like a talisman to fend off a little of midnight’s shadow, is completely gone. The water around me has transformed into a pool of endless ink.

I feel full. As I swim towards the shore, I feel the power of devoured light surging through me.

\________________

>*Inside the boathouse, I’m struck by the oddness of the atmosphere, the unsettling way it defies the rot I’d seen outside. The building’s exterior had looked barely standing, condemned to the verge of collapse, warped boards peeling, waiting to sink into the swamp. Yet, inside the walls are seamless–no cracks, no gaps between the boards for daylight to seep through. The place has no windows, and though the day should be fully dawning outside by now, not a single sliver of light breaches through.*

>*Instead, everything is steeped in a strange, teal phosphorescence, dim and pulsing eerily. The men drag me to a beam in the center of the room, attaching my chains with a quick series of metallic clinks. I cough against the thick, noxious stench. Smelling just as metallic and fetid as my captors, the air has the hot, rancid breath of an overheating machine in a constant state of exhale. I try breathing through my mouth, but even then the taste in the air is tinny, bitter. It’s somehow better than the smell, but not by much.*

>*As my eyes adjust to the gloam within, I glance around the space and notice the source of the glow: in the far corner sits a strange contraption, some kind of machine unlike anything I’ve seen before.*

>*The light pulses from it in rhythm, breathing out a turquoise haze. Tubes and wires twist around it at odd angles, looping and knotting, some diving back into the machine’s body, others disappearing into the walls and floor. Various pipes gleam with condensation, dripping in steady intervals, as though carrying something cold and viscous within. Its blue-green light radiates from no particular spot, but instead seems to diffuse across the entire surface, rising and falling as if in the act of breathing. The diaphanous movement radiating from it makes every shadow move and menace. Seemingly, they stalk the darkened spaces all around me, the edges of them reaching out from where they crouch as though they might devour me whole.*

>*The shorter man notices my gaze lingering on the device. His jaundiced, carroty eyes gleam with an eager, unsettling excitement, and he steps into my line of sight, gesturing back to the machine behind him. He grins, eager, baring a mouthful of mismatched, crooked teeth in a way that makes my skin crawl.* 

>*When he speaks, his voice that same high-pitched trill incongruous with his form; a croaking squeezed from the throat of something drowned:*

>*“Xyrax Coil dims. We dim. Stranded, yes? We wait beneath bad star. Poison star. Burning. Retrieval? They understands, yes? We wait. We fade.”*

>*Fear rises from my stomach, twisting as his words coil through my mind, their meaning alien, indecipherable, though I feel certain he’s making an earnest attempt to explain something–but what exactly? Am I meant to understand and forgive them for kidnapping me from my tent? I stare at him, bewildered, a faint sob rising in my throat. The words are in English, but they’re impossible to parse. I look to the taller man, searching his face for some sign of familiarity or recognition, but he’s silent, his gaze is fixed on his partner, nodding along, as though agreeing with something unspoken.*

>*The tall man meets my eyes, his lips twisting into a strange, wild grin that spreads far too wide, pulling, stretching, stretching and stretching until his mouth is as taut as rubber, skin pulling over his cheeks, distorting far past any human limit. For a horrifying moment, I think he may be trying to comfort me with that smile. A scream rises, raw and unbidden, tearing its way out from my stomach and clawing up my throat, a jagged, ragged sound that scrapes through me endlessly like shards of broken glass. It goes on, and on, and on until my lungs empty, the sound finally dwindling into a series of breathless, heaving sobs.*

>*When I finally look up at the two of them again, the tall man's face, skin thin, nearly translucent and carved in shadows, looks down at his partner with an expression of shock and confusion.*

>*“I don't understand.” I say quietly between the sobs. “I don't know what you were trying to tell me. I don't know what you want.”*

>*The tall one, still looking at the shorter, furrows his brow and seems to raise his hands in an irritated gesture silently conveying:* ***See? I told you.***

>*The small one moves closer to me until his face is inches from mine. Looking over his shoulder he makes his own gesture to the other, as if telling him to shut up, though he hasn't spoken once.*

>*“Weak,” he says, his putrid breath as hot as his touch. He points to himself, then to the strange machine, repeating the word: “Weak.”*

>*Shrill and sickly, his voice seems to drone like the high pitched buzz of insects swarming over bones not yet denuded fully, still clinging to rot.*

>*“They gather.” He says, pointing at me. “They nourish. Yes?”*

>*“No,” I whisper timidly, “gather what? I don't understand what you're trying to–”*

>*He presses his fingers against my lips to silence me, and the searing heat of his touch makes my skin crawl. I wrench my face away, disgust curling in my stomach, but he doesn’t seem bothered by my revulsion. Instead, he raises his finger, pointing to my temple.*

>*“They are one. Also many. Fluid aspects inside. Yes?” I don't know what expression passes over my face but it must tell him something I don’t mean to and he begins nodding wildly.*

>*“They*–***accommodate?”*** *His infection seems to indicate an uncertainty whether this is the word he means to say.*

>*“Yes. ***Accommodate.*** They accommodate more. Yes?”*

>*“No!” The word chokes its way out of me. Bile rises in my throat. I feel sick, violated. The implication of his words is too horrifying to consider, too intimate, and I can’t bear the thought of what he seems to mean.*

>*With a growing tremble of fear, I stammer: “They–they do not accommodate more! No accomodate–no more!”* 

>***How could he know? How could he–***

>*“They accommodate more,” he repeats, a faint, twisted satisfaction in his tone. “More aspect. One more.”*

>*A shiver courses through me, sharp and predatory, slithering through my body like something clawing slowly to life. Inside I feel it burrowing, intent to carve out space within me for itself.*
