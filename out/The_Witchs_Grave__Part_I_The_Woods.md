The Woods

It was Caleb who told us about the church in the woods. Caleb knew every urban legend in town.

Me and his twin sister, Beck, would go along with him in search of proof and a glimpse of the supernatural.

There was the lizard man, the murder house on Ash Street, the abandoned sanatorium, where a cult performed black magic and human sacrifices, and of course the Bunny Bridge, which was said to be a portal into hell.

They were all easily debunked.

The lizard man was arrested for illegally owning and selling exotic wild animals.

The Ash murder house was the scene of a familicide but it no longer exists, as it was demolished a few years ago and transformed into a memorial garden.

The sanatorium, while incredibly creepy, housed no cult, just a group of acid-dropping goths who were happy to share their drugs with us.

And the Bunny Bridge was not a portal to hell but the home of territorial wasps who had taken the bridge as their own.

And then there was the Church in the woods and the cemetery surrounding it.

The legend in town said a powerful witch lived there, surrounded by the graves of her children. They said if she caught you trespassing, she would steal your soul and keep you for eternity as her child.

It was interesting, sure, especially as try as we might, we could never find the church. There was a ritual you had to perform, and of course, none of us knew what that entailed.

We figured it was just the adult’s way of scaring us into staying out of the woods.

When Caleb talked about the other legends, it was with harmless fascination. The church was different.

He spoke about it in hushed reverence.

He wanted to be the first to find it, and he vowed he would.

“I’m going to find it,” he said one night as we ate pizza and watched movies.

“Sure,” Beck said, her mouth full of sauce and cheese. “You do that, Caleb.”

“I am,” he said, uncharacteristically serious.

“I’m going to find it, guys, I will, and then I’ll show you.”

Beck and I shared a look, and she shrugged.

“Okay,” she said. “We believe you.”

❧

I saw little of Caleb for the rest of the year, and I forgot all about the church.

The school year had started, and as a senior, I was so busy that I had no time to think of urban legends.

Instead, I focused on my AP classes, college applications, counseling meetings, applying for scholarships, midterms, finals, and prom.

As busy as we were, me and Beck made time for one another. We had been dating for five years, and I was a regular fixture at her house, as mine was hectic because of my four younger brothers.

That was the night that changed everything.

It was a typical Friday night with Beck and me eating pizza and watching some crappy horror films.

I asked her how Caleb was doing, as his absence was pronounced tonight. He would usually join us.

“Is he okay?” I asked. “I haven’t seen him around lately.”

“You wouldn’t,” Beck said. “He’s basically on house arrest. Dad found out he’s failing three classes and might not graduate. He’s allowed to go to school and the bathroom, and that’s it.”

She said this casually, but I knew she was worried.

“What’s going on with him, Beck?” I asked.

But she wouldn’t look at me, and I changed the subject.

❧

We were fully engrossed in the movie when Caleb burst into Beck’s room. His eyes were wide and manic, and with his wild hair and untamed beard, I barely recognized him.

“Lourdes! Beck! You guys, I did it! I did it; I finally found it!”

“Stop it, Caleb,” Beck said sharply. “Get out, or I’ll call dad.”

Caleb ignores his sister and sets his attention on me. He was trembling in his excitement. “I found it, Lourdes. I found the church!”

I was confused at first, and then realization dawned on me.

“You found it?” I say in genuine amazement. “How?”

Caleb goes into a long-winded explanation that I don’t even attempt to follow.

“The trees! I figured out that you have to trust the trees. And then the crows follow them, but not the bats; the bats are liars. And the grave! The baby’s grave. It’s there; it’s all there!”

He babbles nonsensically and paces back and forth.

He looks crazy; I think. He looks possessed.

Was this what he had been doing this entire year? Talking to trees and following crows?

His obsession has pushed him over the edge.

“Will you come, you guys? Please, you said you would come.”

“No,” Beck says.

“Sure,” I say.

We look at one another.

I have to admit that I am curious. Nobody has ever found the church, and this would probably be the end of our search for urban legends because, in a few months, we would head off to college.

Beck looks tired. She gnaws on her bottom lip.

I squeeze her hand gently.

Come on,” I whisper. “We said we would, after all.”

She rolls her eyes and runs a hand through her choppy hair.

“Fine,” she snaps. “Fine. If we do this, and he sees there’s nothing there but his delusions, maybe he’ll finally wake the fuck up.”

I smile at her, and she smiles back, but it’s strained, and I see fear flickering in her eyes.

❧

Beck drives, and Caleb talks nonstop the entire ride to the woods.

He tells us about the twisted trees and the talking animals he encountered.

He speaks about the faces of the dog and the cemetery with its sunken headstones.

I looked at his reflection in the rearview window. His eyes are wild, and there’s sweat on his upper lip. His hands gesticulate wildly as he talks.

Before we left, Beck pulled me aside as Caleb went to his room to bring the supplies. Whatever those were.

“Are you sure you want to do this? He’s been freaking me out, Lourdes. It’s beyond obsession now.”

“Let’s do it,” I urged. “We both know that we won’t be doing this anymore after we graduate. I know you’re curious because I am.”

Beck said nothing. She was still biting her lip.

“I am,” she admitted. “But I’m also scared. What if this is a trap?” She said, “Like the real Caleb is gone, and this Caleb is leading us there to feed us to the witch.”

“Beck,” I laughed. “That is the plot of the shitty movie we just watched.”

“I know, but Lourdes, he’s been so weird this entire year. I mean, weirder than usual.” She fell silent again, clearly weighing the options in her head.

“Okay, fine, alright, let’s go, but don’t die and have your ghost come crying to me because I told you so.”

After seeing Caleb like this, though, Beck’s uncertainty about the situation makes sense.

As if reading my thoughts, Caleb stops mid-sentence and meets my gaze.

He smiles at me and bares his teeth. A trickle of dark blood runs down one nostril, and his eyes roll back into his head, exposing wet empty sockets.

I gasp, but when I blink, the blood is gone, and Caleb is looking at me curiously. His eyes are tired, but completely normal.

I smile nervously and turn back to face the road.

“Are you okay?” Beck asks, glancing at me.

“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine, just excited.”

It had just been a trick of the light; I assured myself. Nothing else.

But for the rest of the ride, I feel him looking at me, and I know he is smiling.

❧

The woods aren’t woods so much as it is a grove.

It’s relatively big, and the paths are confusing; if you aren’t familiar with the area, you’ll get lost.

Exploring the woods is a rite of passage for the kids in town. We grew up splashing in the dirty creek and digging in the ground, looking for gold. All we ever unearthed were fat earthworms and clusters of pill bugs.

At night, we would run through it under a blanket of black sky and silver stars. We played tag, climbed trees, and waded in that gross water.

I live close to the woods. You could technically call it my backyard.

Beck parks on the curb by my house. It’s completely dark outside.

Good, I think. Everyone is sleeping or out for the night.

 I’m not sure which it is, so just in case, I gesture to Beck and Caleb to be quiet, and we tiptoe to the backyard.

There was no point, though, because the gate screeched as I opened it, but the lights blessedly remained off, and I breathed a sigh of relief.

We approached the woods, me and Beck hesitating while Caleb walked ahead.

I hold Beck’s hand and she smiles at me.

We followed Caleb into the darkness.

We had a witch to find.

Maybe it was because my imagination was already beginning to run wild, but I could swear that as we entered the woods, it significantly grew darker.

The tree’s branches swayed in the wind, sprinkling us with droplets of rain, and the ground was thick with mud.

We said nothing while we followed Caleb, but I could tell that Beck was annoyed. Her body was tense with frustration, and her lips were thin as she chewed on the words she was dying to spit out.

It was nearly midnight, and the sky was pitch black. There were no stars, just the moon, dim and yellow.

Honestly, I was disappointed. With us learning that the church and witch were real I thought that the woods would change into a landscape of phantasmagorical horrors, complete with thick fog and disembodied whispers warning us to leave.

It was creepy, but it was the same woods I have walked in hundreds of times before. The only difference was the volumes of sound that had increased tenfold--the babble of water, the chirp of bugs, and the low hoot of an owl.

This was the soundtrack of the night

Caleb was quiet now, a dramatic from how talkative he had been the entire ride here.

His lips were pinched and white in a determined grimace, and his eyes were serious.

We had been walking for around ten minutes when he stopped suddenly.

I nearly stumbled into him, and Beck glared at his backside as though, with her gaze, she could set him on fire.

We were at a junction that divided itself into many paths. The left led to the highway; the right led to the creek, and the center most one took you to the farmhouse, an abandoned, dilapidated relic that the county pretended didn’t exist.

Caleb was muttering to himself. He took out a pouch, opened it, and poured its contents onto the ground.

I saw bits of wheat, corn, raisins, and sunflowers. It was birdseed.

What the hell is he doing? I thought. Beck opened her mouth, but Caleb held up his hand.

“Please,” he said, still spreading the birdseed. “I can’t have anyone interrupt me.”

This was the Caleb I knew. Intelligent and methodical.

The pouch was now empty, and Caleb was still talking to himself. I couldn’t make out a word. And then he said loudly and clearly,

“Bless us all to the ends of our days. Bless us so we may live to see tomorrow.

He stood still for a moment. It had become very quiet; even the wind had stopped. I could only hear Caleb’s heavy breathing. It looked as though he were steeling himself for something.

He nodded and then pulled something out of his bag. And it took me a moment to realize that it was a knife.

Before I could say anything or even react, Caleb held his hand out and slashed at his palm.

I gasped, Beck shrieked, and Caleb was silent except for his blood dripping onto the ground.

Beck was pissed, and she rushed toward him.

She stopped in her tracks as Caleb looked at her. His eyes were wild and angry.

She gawked at him but didn’t say a word.

Beck was the oldest by nine minutes and was the stereotypical tough, bossy sister, while Caleb was her opposite; he was shy and sweet. I had never seen him like this before, and Beck obviously hadn’t either.

Dark blood streamed down Caleb’s wrist; and dripped off his fingertips like rain.

I felt sick but watched transfixed as each droplet of blood stained and seeped into the bird seed.

We heard them before we saw them.

It was a low buzzing, like an annoying fly invading your personal space but times that by one hundred. The buzzing crescendoed into deep guttural croaking and then a rustling, the sound of many things flapping.

Beck and I looked at one another and then up at the sky.

Even in the darkness, we could see it, a dark cloud coming closer and closer.

There is no fucking way, I thought. What the fuck?

They were crows, dozens and dozens of crows flying towards us, their maniacal cawing so loud that I temporarily went deaf.

There were so many of them they blocked out the faraway moon. We were plunged into absolute darkness, and now deaf and blind, I could only feel their presence. Their feathers struck my face.

A group of crows is called a murder, I thought wildly.

Murdermurdermurdermurdermur

And then my senses returned to me. The moon reappeared, and I watched as they flew towards Caleb and descended onto the birdseed hungrily.

It was silent except for the clicking of beaks.

“What in the absolute fuck?” Beck muttered. “Caleb, what the fuck is going on?”

Caleb turned his gaze away from the crows he had been watching with interest.

They ate the birdseed until it was gone and then in complete synchronization, took flight towards the path on the left.

Caleb looked at us with a slight grin on his face.

“I told you we must follow the crows,” he said.

“Dramatic much?” Beck said under her breath.

Caleb ignored her. His eyes tracking the crows. “Let’s -“ he says, and then he stops. He looks scared.

My stomach drops as I follow his gaze and then my heart pounds in my chest so hard it hurts.

Two shadowy figures have emerged from the thicket of trees ahead of us, and I can feel the hate and the evil emanating from them.

They stagger toward us, hands outstretched, reaching with long, thin fingers. And I know that this is the witch and her minion, ready to gouge out our eyes and eat our souls.

I scream. Beck screams. Caleb screams.

And then, shockingly, Caleb’s shriek cuts off and turns into laughter.

“Oh, you guys came! You made it!” He says gleefully.

I blink, and the shadows come into focus, the moonlight unveiling them.

A boy and a girl around our age stare back at us. The girl’s full lips are twisted into a sly smile.

What is she doing here? I think.

“Oh god, not you.” Beck says, her voice dripping with disdain.“What are you doing here?”

The girl in front of us is still smiling. Her pretty brown face is haughty, and her hair is long and woven into tiny braids.

She pushes a braid out of her face with one long, lacquered nail.

“I could ask the same of you, Rebecka.” She says snidely. “Why are you here?”

“Caleb is my brother, dumbass. I don’t have to answer you.”

“And Caleb is my boyfriend, Rebecka. I don’t have to answer you either.”

Beck turns to Caleb, enraged.

“You told me you guys broke up!” She says and Caleb has the grace to look ashamed. He looks down at the ground, his cheeks burning.

“Well, we did, but then Madeline -“

Madeline saunters over to Caleb and wraps her arms around his waist. She glares at Beck.

“Why do you think we must tell you everything about our relationship? What’s it to you?”

The two bicker, their voices rising. Caleb attempts to calm them down, but they ignore him as if he isn’t there.

“Who are you?” I say to the boy, who looks like he would love nothing more than to disappear back into the trees.

He looks like a pale version of Madeline with bright red hair.

“Ezra, um, I’m Ezra,” he clears his throat. “Madeline’s brother.”

“Half-brother,” Madeline corrects, pausing her fight with Beck. She stares daggers at Ezra.

Ezra rolls his eyes. “Right, her half-brother. Madeline needed a ride here and didn’t want to go in alone. She failed her driving test again and-“

“Shut up, Ezra!” Madeline screeches.

He smirks, and I do too. “Right, sorry. She did not fail her test for the 3rd time; she just needed a chaperone.”

Madeline looks murderous.

I laugh. I like Ezra already.

Caleb and Madeline have been dating on and off since 7th grade. Mostly off because of Madeline.

Beck hates Madeline for the constant manipulation of her twin, and Madeline loves confrontation.

“Why were you guys hiding behind the tree?” I ask. “Why were you trying to scare us?”

Ezra has the decency to look ashamed, but Madeline bursts into peals of laughter.

“We got you, didn’t we? Whew, the look on your faces was so funny!”

“No, it wasn’t funny, Madeline, you stupid cow,” Beck snaps. “You’re lucky if I don’t dropkick you.”

This starts a fresh round of fighting between them, and my head is starting to hurt.

“Uh, guys,” I say. Can we keep moving? I want to go to sleep before dawn.”

They stop, and Beck says sorry. She sheepishly comes to my side while Madeline hugs Caleb’s waist.

“Lead the way,” Beck says somewhat resignedly. “We’re all here, so time to meet this witch.”

Caleb smiles and gestures toward the trees where the crows have perched.

They fly towards them, and the trees part. Some bend and others uproot themselves. Their branches arch and their trunks twist to reveal a hidden path.

A path that shimmers in a kaleidoscope of patterns made up of colors I have no name for.

I don’t think there is a word to describe how I feel at this moment, but if I had to settle on one, it would be enchanted. It deepens with every step I take. What is this place that ceremony, blood, and crows have revealed?

I’m tripping. Much harder than the time I took acid in that rotting asylum.

I like it, though.

I can see the air moving, and the wind calls my name.

The trees are whispering to one another, and the crows have once again perched themselves on their waving branches, silent and staring

They see everything.

This is it, I think giddily. This is where I want to die.

I do not know where that thought comes from, and I don’t care.

There is a rumbling underneath me that makes my entire body shake, and without looking, I know the crooked trees have straightened and returned to their respective roots.

I know that the path behind us has closed.

❧

The bats are following me, and they’re telling me horrible things.

“Somebody died in the creek, you know--a young boy,” one whispers.

“His body was swollen and blue when they fished him out,” another bat sneers. “And when they placed him on the dirt, his stomach burst and was full of maggots.”

“Don’t you want to know what the farmer’s wife thought as he bashed her head open?” The third bat giggles. “Oh, the things you think while you die. You’d be surprised, oh, you would be surprised.”

They won’t stop, and I can still hear them. They won’t stop.

The bats are liars, Caleb had said. Okay, but a boy had drowned in the creek. We had been friends, and I remember seeing the police officers trudge into the woods and come out holding a large black bag, looking pale.

And the farmer in that farmhouse had murdered his wife and then shot himself with his shotgun after.

Not lies, truths.

I wonder if anybody else is experiencing what I am. I look around me, and Beck is pale, Madeline’s eyes are wide and afraid, and Ezra’s cheeks are wet with tears, and when - he looks at me, I see his eyes are red.

Only Caleb looks unperturbed.

Maybe Beck was right, I think. Perhaps he has made a deal with the witch, and we are his sacrifices.

“She won’t take your eyes,” the bat says, so close to my ear that its fur tickles me. “She’ll rip out your heart and make you eat it, and then she’ll bury you alive.”

“Stop,” I mutter and shoo it away. “Go away, you little shit.”

I try to focus on where I am and where we are going. Beck’s hand is warm and soft in my own, and that grounds me.

It’s quiet, and the crows unfurl in the sky like streaming ribbons. Occasionally, they shed a feather, and it drifts down
                                        down
                                            down

I catch one and marvel at its beauty. It shimmers in my hand, embedded with dark jewels.

I turn it over to inspect it further, and when I do, the jewels shift and crawl over my wrist. They trail down my arm and creep up my neck; they burrow themselves into my hair.

I drop the feather and pat myself as if I were on fire. I itch all over.

They fall off me like raindrops and scurry away on the ground. Not jewels, I think, feeling sick. Bugs.


Beck looks disgusted and over it. She says nothing, but I know she wants to.

The deeper we walk into the woods, the trippier it gets.

The sky is red; there’s no moon or sun; everything is just red.

The flat ground has transformed into crumbling cobblestone, and I know I shouldn’t be amazed after everything I’ve experienced so far, but oh, I am.

My body vibrates with every step, and it is thrumming with energy. It feels good; it feels really, really good.

The air has changed; it smells sweet but unpleasant. It reminds me of the smell of rotting fruit.

The trees are breathing. Slow inhales, and loud exhales that make their branches quiver.

Everything around me is shimmering, and I am blinded by sensations and colors

My vision distorts, and what I see is terrifying. Beck’s eyes are large black pools, and her mouth is wide and screaming.

Madeline’s mouth is stretched from ear to ear like a smug Cheshire Cat.

Ezra’s red hair is on fire, and when I look at him, I see his eyes burst and run down his face like yolk.

Caleb turns to look at me, and he is bloated and blue. When he opens his mouth to speak, wriggling maggots dribble out.

His mouth keeps moving, but I can’t hear him. All I hear is a high-keening whistle.

It gets higher and higher, louder and louder and I feel something hot and wet drip out of my ears. I touch it and my fingers come away smeared with dark red blood.

My blood clumps together and then break apart.

It transforms into ruby red jewels that then turn into bugs.

They climb up my arm and chew through my neck. They dig into the whorls of my brain.

My skull is burning, and I hear screams.

Bloodcurdling screams make the leaves on the trees curl and fall to the ground, smoking.

The screams go on and on, and more blood leaks from my ears. It sprays from my nose like a geyser and trickles from my eyes.

I can’t see, hear or breathe and I am drowning in my blood.

And then everything goes black, the screaming stops and the world is silent.

I open my eyes, and I am on the ground. The sky is black, and the moon is yellow.

Beck and Ezra’s terrified faces loom over me. Beck’s skin is milk-white, and she has been crying.

“Are you okay?” She asks after they help me up.

“I’m fine,” I reply, but my voice shakes, and my hands are trembling and smeared with dried blood.

“What is happening? What happened?”

Beck doesn’t answer; instead, she whirls on Caleb, standing to the side with a scared-looking Madeline. His face is blank, and Beck’s face contorts in rage.

“We are done.” She spits. “I don’t give a shit about any of this anymore, Caleb! Lourdes is bleeding from her fucking ears and eyes and nearly didn’t wake up, and you’re just standing there! You cut yourself like some goddamn sacrifice. I’m done. We. Are. Done.” She repeats. “Fuck you, and fuck this fucking place and this so-called witch. You can stay, but we are out.”

She doesn’t wait for a response. She grabs my wrist and practically drags me down the path from whence we came.

“The path’s closed,” Caleb calls behind us. “You can’t get out that way. I’m the only one who knows the way. I know what to do to get in and get out.”

Beck’s shrieks are incomprehensible.

“Then fucking tell me how to get the fuck out, Caleb, you fucking asshole!”

“Besides,” Caleb says, ignoring her. “We’re already here.”

“What?”

Beck and I look at one another and then turn around.

I gasp, and Beck mutters:

“What the fuck?”

It is there. We’re here.

❧

There are faces in the fog of all ages and genders. The only similarity is their eyes. They’re closed as though they are sleeping, but I know they’re not.

The church looms in the distance on a hill.

It’s made of crumbling, white brick weathered by time and lack of care.

Its door is painted a dull, dirty grey and on top of its small structure is a steeple. It houses a church bell that sways gently in the breeze.

Surrounding the church are dozens of old headstones; they jut from the ground like crooked teeth. The fog rests there like a blanket shielding the cemetery, protecting it.

Protecting it from us? I wonder. Or us from it.

Beck and I rejoin the group, and we are all silent in our wonder.

“I can’t believe it’s real; it’s fucking real,” I hear Beck muttering.

I look at Caleb, and I am shocked to see that he is kneeling on the ground, crying.

“Hello,” he sobs. “I’m here again.”

Yeah, this is really fucking weird.

I understand, though.

The church and its cemetery are hauntingly beautiful. The scenery reminds me of a fairy tale, a macabre fairy tale, sure, but a fairy tale nevertheless.

It’s day here.

The sky is cloudless and light blue, and the sun beams down on the church seraphically. 

This is the lair of the witch?

Besides the fog and the twisted headstones, it didn’t look like I thought it would, and glancing at the others’ faces, and I know they are thinking the same.

Caleb has finally stopped crying, and now swiping at his wet cheeks, he stands up.

He turns to the rest of us, his smile wide and charming. I’ve missed that smile, and a sudden wave of sadness washes over me. He hasn’t smiled like that in so long.

“We’re here, you guys! We’re finally here! Didn’t I tell you? Isn’t this amazing?”

Nobody knows what to say. I mean, what is there to say?

We are here, and it is pretty amazing. We have finally found truth in an urban legend. Well, partial truth. We have yet to see the witch.

Beck, who has also been gazing at the church in stunned awe, shakes herself out of it as though she has just remembered how mad she had been at Caleb ten minutes ago.

She scowls.

“Great, yeah, incredible. It’s amazing. So when are we going? How do we get out?”

Caleb’s brow furrows as if he doesn’t understand what she’s saying.

“Get out?” He repeats, puzzled.

“Yeah, Caleb, get out. This has been fun and everything, but it’s getting late or early,” Beck glances at the sun. “Can we go?”

“But we just got here, Rebecka! We haven’t even seen the witch!”

“Do you not see how creepy this is? How weird it all feels?”

“It feels just fine! God, I am so tired of you bossing me around. We only do what you want to do!”

Caleb is wrong, though. Beck is right. It doesn’t feel good here. It’s beautiful, but everything is wrong. My skin is prickling with goosebumps.

Ezra and Madeline look as uncomfortable as I feel. Madeline stares at the church as quietly as a mouse, her mouth ajar.

“How do we leave?” Beck asks again. “You said you know how.”

“I do,” Caleb says.

“Then do it.”

“No.”

“Then tell us!”

“No!”

Beck grabs Caleb’s bag, snarling, and Caleb slaps her hands away. She bites him, and he yelps and then they begin to slap-fight one another.

Beck grabs the bag again and snatches it from Caleb gleefully. She sticks her tongue out at him and opens it, and then pulls out a notebook, frowning.

She flips through its pages and then throws it at him.

“It’s fucking empty, you asshole!”

“I know!” Caleb shoots back, rubbing his bruised arm. He taps his head. “It’s all up here, I told you. “

“Tell. Me.” Beck says through gritted teeth.

“No. Come on, we have to find the witch, and you guys will see!”

Caleb turns on his heels and walks toward the church, but he’s not looking at where he’s going.

He doesn’t notice the small grave marker peeking out of the dirt. If he had, he surely would have stepped over it. And if he had tripped and the bigger headstone behind it wasn’t there, he would have just landed face-first in the dirt.

But none of that happened, and that grave was there, and as much as we wish to change the past, it’s already been written.

When Caleb trips over the grave marker, I see the look of surprise on his face as he falls. He looks ridiculous at that moment; it’s like he wants to say oh shit, this is going to hurt.


I shut my eyes, but it’s too late. It wouldn’t have done me good, anyway. The sound of Caleb’s neck breaking will haunt me forever.

The quiet that follows is the longest I have ever experienced. I never knew silence could be so loud.

And then the air is ripped apart by Beck’s raw, guttural screams.

She runs towards Caleb, and we follow her mutely.

Ezra helps as we turn him over carefully while Madeline dances around us, squealing in a small voice: “Don’t move him! Don’t move him! Oh, you’re not supposed to move him!”

When we do, and Madeline sees him, she takes one look and turns around to vomit.

I take a quick intake of breath.

Caleb’s head is bent to one side, and his eyes are open and blood-red. They’re moving, and they flit from me to Ezra to Beck. They fixate on Beck when he sees her. His lips quiver as though he’s trying to smile.

Beck is patting his hand and crying while telling him he’s good, he’s fine. We’re going to get help for you, okay? You’re fine, you’re fine, you’ll be okay. I love you. I love you. Don’t leave me like Mom. I love you. Please. Please.

And then Caleb’s eyes stop moving, they remain fixated on the crystal blue sky. His hand goes limp in Beck’s hand, and she grabs onto him even tighter. Her screams are animalistic and primal, and she refuses to let go of him.

I don’t know what to do, and I can’t breathe.

I feel robbed of my senses, my joy.

How is it fair that, in a second, life changes everything so drastically?

He was just here. He was just talking and just fighting with Beck. It’s a dream. Wake up, Lourdes. Wake up.

But I am awake. It is Caleb who now sleeps.

I am so full and heavy with grief that, temporarily; I forget where we are.

It’s the church bell that reminds me. The wind has picked up; it’s strong and makes the bell clang wildly. It slams against the steeple walls so hard that I wonder if it will crack.

The sky is darkening with a convergence of clouds. They overtake the light of the sun.

The wind is fury, and it blows my hair into my face. But in the wind, I hear a disembodied voice. It’s Caleb’s, and his words make my blood run cold.

“I’m the only one who knows how to get out of here,” Caleb had said. “It’s all up here.”

Oh. No.

Oh, fucking hell.
