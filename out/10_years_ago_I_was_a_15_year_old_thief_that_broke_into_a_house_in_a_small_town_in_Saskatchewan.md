Before I start I’ll note, that when I was young I had no parental guidance, I grew up in a reservation, in a household that had no rules & no food. I then moved to North battleford at 15 where I met 4 other kids from school that were dealt with the same shitty cards life had given me. We thought were a tight nit group of hardcore thugs, but really all we did was car shop enough change each night for some 7/11 food. 

That all changed when we started stealing cars and joy riding them to different farms and small towns to steal anything that wasn’t bolted down in someone’s yard, that we could later sell. We really moved up from petty theft for such young teens. Now here is the part that scared me straight, into the young successful tax paying member of society I am today. 

One night we decided to drive into a small town, maybe 40 minutes north. Me & my 4 delinquent friends, got out and started searching for other cars and notable things we could also steal. While walking around I suddenly stopped & I found myself staring at this house, it looked nice, a big middle class home. I had this urge that was pulling me to it, I called my friends over & told them I wanted to break into the garage. All of them were shocked as we had never done anything like that other than steal a car that was parked on the street or in the drive way. 

Nonetheless i convinced them to follow me up to the house, if it’s locked, that would be the end of it. Unfortunately it wasn’t. I twisted the garage handle and the door opened quite easily. I let go & a small wind gust swung the door further open thus turning a dim automatic light on inside the garage. I stepped inside to look for valuables and my friends were one step behind me, almost pushing me in as they were so eager to see what was inside as well. We all stopped, and laughed, as there was nothing but empty milk jugs in that big garage, literally nothing but empty 4l 2l 1l milk jugs and cartons. It was truly  dumbfounding. 

There must’ve been about 200 of them just laying all over these big jumbo blue recycle bags that took half the garage. It seemed to me they gave up bagging them as there were many jumbo bags filled with the same said milk jugs and cartons. I felt unsatisfied seeing nothing but that.

 My friend then noticed a door on the other side of the garage. Only I followed him, he opened it and pushed it wide. suddenly we were peaking into someone’s home from the inside of their garage. Our 3 younger friends decided to stay in the garage and wait. It led us 3 steps down and then we were in their basement. Pitch black. Old 90s thin rug carpet through out the basement. 

We noticed there was steps leading upstairs further inside the house, it was dimly lit up there. We decided to search the basement first. With our phone flashlights we scanned the room. It was completely empty, with 3 doors leading to different rooms, I assumed. I suddenly felt odd like someone was watching us. I couldn’t help but to keep staring at the stairs incase the owner had heard us sneaking in. 

I figured that because the basement was so empty & seemed abandoned that, whoever lives there must all sleep upstairs. My friend motioned us to the closest door to us, we were now going to snoop in the basement rooms for valuables. Upon opening the door we were startled as something came pouring out of the room. We shuttled back two steps & looked down to see what it was.

 For 5 seconds we stared at nothing but baby doll heads. We looked at eachother in confusion. We decided to push open the door further as it seemed stuck. & then spilled out a lot of baby doll heads, we flashed our lights in the room and it was filled about 5ft high and suddenly we were hit with the absolute worst stench either of us had ever smelled in our lives. I had a sudden fear like I’ve never felt in my entire life. Both of must have as we didn’t say a word and started to make our hurriedly exit. We never spoke of it & told our other friends it was empty. To this day that smell bugs me & I always wonder what the fuck that was about! Why did whoever lived there have that many milk jugs? & that many baby doll heads? Where were the bodies of said dolls? Why did it smells so bad in that particular room? Why are small town people so fucking weird? Did I willingly enter a house of horrors or weird kink & escape?
