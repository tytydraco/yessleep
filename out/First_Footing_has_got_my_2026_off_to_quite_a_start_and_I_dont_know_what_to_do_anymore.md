It's only been thirteen days into 2026 and I am about 83% sure I have already completely, utterly ruined it. On the plus side, I am not so sure I will ever have to worry about another year again. 

It all started with this damned The Old Farmer's Almanac article. During a fine evening of phone-in-bed doomscrolling, I came across a news post proclaiming that Farmers' Almanac was closing up shop, and confused it for The Old Farmer's Almanac. Thankfully, several commenters (with varying degrees of civility) had set me on the straight and narrow, and I knew my favorite witchy guide to the moons and seasons would be around for another year. And what a horrific year 2025 had been for me. First, my cat died. Sure, he was seventeen, but that just made me sadder. I'd had him since I was seven and had gotten to move out with him. Then, my boyfriend left for another girl, and now she's pregnant. My own mother said "Hey, at least he didn't cheat" when he left in February (what a way to pregame Valentine's Day!) and "Oh! Good for him! How exciting!" when news of the pregnancy broke around Thanksgiving. After that breakup, my annual physical in April revealed pre-diabetes and further tests showed that I had autoantibodies against my own pancreas. That means I am basically very slowly developing type 1 diabetes (though they call it LADA or Type 1.5). After systemically removing every bit of joy from my diet (keto cupcakes just aren't the same), I am proud to say that my doctor put me on insulin in October because it did sweet f all.

I don't mean to sound like the whiniest crybaby on the block. I just want you all to understand why I did what I did when I read on The Old Farmer's Almanac about an old New Year's practice called First Footing. It's a superstition that, as far as I've read, has existed in many parts of Europe as well as some parts of Asia. Whoever visits your home first on New Year's determines your luck. A tall, dark, (and presumably handsome!) male stranger is ideal, while a fair-haired man is less ideal. My ex, who was definitely the first one in this efficiency apartment on 1/1/25, was a blonde. Figured. 

How could I ensure a tall, dark, handsome man came in, who I did not yet know? In a wonderful display of self-preservation and fantastic judgement, especially as a young lady in the big ol' city, I placed an ad on Craigslist. It called for a tall, dark, handsome stranger to bring a silver coin to my apartment on New Year's Day, and stay for some coffee and homebaked pastries. I posted it on Christmas Eve, because the most adjusted males in the city were clearly going to be scrolling Craigslist on Christmas instead of hanging out with family (I swear I am not usually this dumb). Maybe they celebrated Chaunukah or Yule or friggin Festivus instead (if I am lucky), and they'd be perfectly adjusted! 

I got a response on Boxing Day, a text from a number with a local area code. 

"Saw your ad. Happy to oblige. Grandfather was a coin collector. Got a good one for you. I know we gotta be strangers though so I'll keep myself under wraps til New Year's!"

My mother would cloister me away for the rest of my natural life if she knew that I replied to this man with "Sounds great, thanks!" followed by my address. 

On New Year's Day, I sat on my couch, rapt attention on my door until there was finally a light tap on it. 9:03am per my phone. Hey, he was pretty punctual! This may work out! 

The man in the doorway was indeed tall, dark, and handsome, but he was also the least memorable person I have ever laid eyes on. If you've ever seen those posts that average all photographs of men/women from different regions, he looked exactly like one of them. His features were in perfect proportion, perfect ratio, and perfect symmetry. He smiled, revealing Colgate-white teeth. He handed me a silver coin of a denomination I did not recognize and still do not (and boy, have I tried to find it). The characters on it were some sort of symbol-based language, but not one I'd ever seen before. The man on the coin, sailing on a raft of some sort, looked remarkably like our Tall, Dark, Handsome Stranger but clearly wasn't him. He was taller, more defined, and wore his hair in a long braid, with squiggles on his skin that I took to be tattoos. On the back of it, there was a little fox-like animal that almost appeared to be smiling. I smiled in turn, almost sheepishly thanking him. 

Our coffee was nice, but quiet. I tried a few times to spark off a conversation, but he answered in short, generic, yet friendly sentences. At 10:00 on the dot, he slapped his knees suddenly, stood up, offered a handshake, and said "Gotta run! Your year should go your way now, Miss". Oh how I hoped he was right at the time. 

The first sign of anything odd (god I can't believe this was only thirteen days ago) was just an hour later, when I checked my blood sugar. Gotta give a really quick crash course on diabetes here (don't take medical advice from girls who let strangers into their apartments). Normal blood sugar is about 70 to 140. My goal range was 80 to 120. I was on two types of insulin. Long acting Lantus and short acting Lispro. Lantus is always there in the background while Lispro compensates for meals. Despite being a Very Bad Diabetic and eating a Danish with nothing but long acting Lantus onboard, my blood sugar was a healthy 79. It should have been 250 at the lowest. I reluctantly ate a sandwich without insulin. At this point, my sugar should have been at least 300. Yet on recheck, it was 92. At this point, I grabbed a whole chocolate bar and ate it. Rechecked my sugar, and it was 112. An hour later, it was 87. This has held up. I haven't injected a drop of insulin since before I went to bed on New Year's Eve, and my blood sugar has never been higher than 126. I am eating like a raccoon in a dumpster, keto-be-damned. 

The second sign of anything odd was the morning of January 2, so eleven days ago. My upstairs neighbor was tapdancing at 5am. I know people say that metaphorically, usually due to the acoustics of apartment buildings, but I mean that literally. Ruth Barry was a tapdancing instructor and performer, and she was practicing. She was highly annoying about it. Our landlord had even cleared a spot and made her a little studio in the basement-it was a real labor of love, too. I saw him down there with his wife and college-aged daughters painstakingly putting it together, from sanding and finishing the wood floor to installing a bar and mirror. Ruth, who ought to be called Karen, decided that she "didn't like the feng shui" of the place. Still, I wish that I had thought "I wish Ruth would use that beautiful little studio". Instead, I thought "I wish that entitled nuisance would drop dead." I didn't mean it. I really didn't. But I thought it, and I guess I thought it hard enough. The obit isn't live yet, but she died moments later. I heard the thud. My annoyance turned to worry, and I knew deep within my gut that I was the cause. The rest of that day is a blur, and I won't bore you with the details. 

The only thing I can figure is that the man on the raft on the coin is steering the ship of fate, and, now that I've got the coin, I am at the healm. I do not, however, want the responsibility, especially since frivolous thoughts seem to drive it as effectively as well-crafted, well-considered ones. 

To make matters worse, I do think there is something malevolent about it. First, I tried to use it to eradicate cancer. No dice. Second, I tried to use it to cure an individual's cancer (searched through GoFundMe), also no dice, which was strange to me because of my diabetes. 

It has only been thirteen days, and I am responsible for two additional deaths. 

The first was careless again. I wished an annoying drunk cyclist circling outside the complex would go away, and apparently, that means forever. Moments later, he meandered into the road and was almost instantly killed by a car. May have been a coincidence but I don't think so. 

The second was haunting. My next door neighbor Cyndy is an angel without wings, but she works too hard for too little (there's a Cyndy in every apartment complex I'd venture). She endeavors to provide for her son, whom she dotes upon. I wished for a financial windfall for her, as well as financial freedom. 

One of her jobs offered life insurance for both her and her son. I bet you can guess what happened. 

Cyndy hasn't left the apartment since, but I can hear her wailing sobs each day through the paper thin walls. Rumor has it he had an undetected heart defect. I know better. And I don't know how to exist in society without endangering others anymore.
