John's heart fluttered to the rhythm of the bass. Every hit of the drum vibrated the walls of the sweaty basement he was sandwiched in. The song playing must have been going at least 200 BPM and his heart pounded along with it, beat by beat.

It was an extremely uncomfortable feeling. Currently John’s heart pounded with force, but it felt like an illusion of strength and that any beat could be its last.

Despite this feeling John could not keep the smile off of his face. The liquid happiness drug cocktail in his veins would not let him. A good thing too as beyond the current mania lay only panic.

A hand on his shoulder turned John around. James mouthed some intelligible words and motioned to the exit. The message was clear. John nodded and began a shoving shuffle through the mass of dancers. 

“You good?” James asked

“Fuck yea dude!” John replied.

“Aight man, me and Mads are about to head, you comin?” 

“What man? Now? It’s only 3 you pussy.”

“I got work” James shrugged. 

“Argh whatever dude, nah I’m staying, see ya around” 

“Later man” 

James motioned to a girl John had never seen before and stumbled into the night. 

And so John was alone. He spared a glance at his watch, it read 3:09. He glanced back at the entrance of the club, a congregation of drunks had formed in droplets and cliques around its entrance. He was feeling himself slide down the peak into the valley of despair that is sobriety and he was not ready to face that challenge yet, so he weighed his options.

A text and a rapid reply gave him a meeting spot for his next score. A little coke would keep the party going. His wallet however would need refilling first. A bit of drunk math and navigation set him on course for the nearest ATM.

The night was cold for June. The drugs were keeping him from feeling the worst of the cold but John could not suppress a shiver. His shirt was doing a poor job at covering him up and the fabric chafed against his vasoconstricted skin.

It was always busy in Berlin and tonight was no different. Every corner formed a meeting spot for the nights partiers, dealers, salary men and general up-to-no-goods. John was hardly a rare sight. Perhaps he stumbled and looked around a bit more than your general intoxicated night goer. 

John fumbled with his breast pocket where he kept a banged up pack of smokes. Eventually he fished one out of the frayed container and with numb fingers tried to spark it. 

“Fuck” He swore.

The sparks flew but no flame graced the cigs tip.

“Need a hand there friend?” A voice said.

“Fuck, yea man, fuckin lighers fucked” to hell, he wanted to say. The last part died on his lips when he turned around.

In all black stood the man. A smile on his face. John could not tell if it was the acid but it seemed to him that his smile stretched beyond the confines of the hood casting the rest of the man's face in a deep shadow. The shadow the man's stature cast broiled and boiled in the iridescent street light. In his outstretched hand he held a zippo with a skull engraving. 

“Help yourself.” The man said.

John’s cigarette hung limply in his mouth for a second before he leaned and held it to the flame.

“Thanks man.” John mumbled.

“No problem, take care.” The man said, turning around and walking into the night.

His shadow crawled up a light post as he passed it. John shook his head and blinked his eyes but the vision stuck.

“Weird fucking guy.” he said to himself.

Just before turning around to continue his journey to the money machine, a green glow caught the corner of his eye. John turned to face it and saw it came from behind a dumpster down an alley. He stared and blinked repeatedly, trying to dispel the light. He had no such luck. The glow pulsed slightly as John watched. He glanced down the road where the man had gone and found him gone. Disappeared into the frigid night of party goers. 

John stood and thought for a minute. Trying to organize his drug addled brain to form a coherent thought was proving to be challenging. Wrangling his cognition into a moment of perfect clarity a thought doused him in ice. This is probably a bad idea. Then it was gone. Back into the waves of noise and fuzz that pulsed through his entire body in waves. Like a dog John shook himself and immediately forgot what he had just put together. 

Instead what gripped him was the light. 

Stumbling steps took him from the light bathed main road into the shadowy entrance of the alley. As he crossed the threshold between road and alley an extra chilling breeze caught his shirt. The fabric coarse against his skin felt as if it would rub his nipple raw and drew a little blood. John clamped his arms across his chest and stepped further into the alley.

Past a garbage pile that was home to a metropolis of rats he stumbled. A broken bottle caught the light of main street and for a second glowed like an emerald star in the void of space. The green glow still pulsed. Just around the corner of the city dumpster now. John slowed his approach at the corner of the dumpster.

On his toes he peaked up and over the dumpster. The scene beyond did not compute. A mess of limbs in various states of undress formed a messy pyramid of horror. The crowning piece was a skull stripped clean of flesh, still wet with moisture but lacking any adornments expected of a head. Around the pyramid a circle of runes were responsible for the green glow. They were scrawled on to the alley floor with white chalk and pulsed and wriggled as if alive. 

John did not have the present of mind to scream. When he understood what exactly he was looking at he whipped around to the entrance of the alley. This time the hand on his shoulder was not that of a friend.

“Sorry, I needed a second. This guy had a pacemaker.” The smiling man in black said with a shrug.

John felt a pinch in his chest. He looked down and saw only the wrist of the man in black. The last thing he felt was his heart being wrenched out of his chest. The last thing he saw was it beating the same club rhythm in the cold June air.
