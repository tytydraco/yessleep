Full disclosure: this is my experience - it’s up to you whether you choose to believe me. I have very vivid dreams and with some of the scarier dreams I have, like these, I am able to easily remember them.

The first time I saw her, I lived in an older house. I was laying on my back, the sun was starting to come in from the windows. She was at the end of my bed, a pale blue,  black scoops of darkness where her eyes were supposed to be. Strands of black hair, a gaping pitch black mouth. She was scrawny, dropping boobs and crawled onto my bed like a monkey. She looked as if she was screaming but I couldn’t hear anything. She tried to get close but I woke up.

The next time I saw her, I was in my apartment. There was a light near my door, I saw her “helper” or the “watcher” in my doorway. Pitch black but with white eyes and a large wide-sharp toothed smile. He had black and sharp armor on his shoulders and intense long black pointy nails that dug into my doorway (which I did look, I have scratches on my doorway - could’ve been there before). I was staring at him disturbed. Then I looked over. A beautiful naked woman stood at the end of my bed. She slowly climbed on me, naked, and seductively. She climbed on me then pinned my arms down, she suddenly looked like an older woman, angry, and I saw myself as if I were watching from the ground, she was sucking something in or out of my mouth. I remember thinking “I need to force my body to move, or I am going to die”. I somehow moved my body to my side and woke up, gasping. Both of my arms were numb. One of my arms became less numb, I helped my other arm move my other arm to grab my phone. It turned to 3:00 AM on the dot. I stayed awake until 4:00 AM, crying.
Someone on a Facebook group helped me because I had begged for help on how to keep them away. It was then, I learned it was the Old Hag and the Watcher. He provided me with advice, such as to spray Florida Water in the corners of my room and say a blessing. I did exactly that.
About a week later, I saw her in my dreams. She was angry, she saw me but couldn’t get near me. There were obstacles being thrown and she kept getting farther away, I could finally hear her screeching.

I haven’t seen her since. It has been about four months now, I’d say. I’ve also seen shadow figures, full apparitions, communicated with spirits, witnessed people get scratched, etc. I would like to share more of my stories on here when I have the time.

Feel free to share your thoughts and/or your experiences on this post. Thank you for reading and hopefully they don’t come back after me writing this LOL.
