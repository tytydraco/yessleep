Being a police officer for the Bridgville Police Department, you see almost everything. For a jurisdiction of only 2.5 square miles, you see a-lot of action. From the violent domestic violence calls, fights in parking lots, looting, stealing, break-ins, you name it there is everything. What the police force doesn’t train you for is the paranormal, and  what lies beyond this realm. 

It was August of 2012, I remember this month because this was my 6th year with the BPD. This day was also remembered because it was eerily calm. Usually we have police calls stacked and always running around lights and sirens from start to end of shift, but not this day. Due to low staff I had to work the midnight shift and come in for my regular shift which was the daylight shift. Which I didn’t mind because for me, it was extra money. Extra money to take care of me and my brother Michael. Our father was a dead beat dad, always in and out of jail and unreliable. Our mother unfortunately died of breast cancer. Her name was Angel, and her death will always be engraved in my mind. 

It was June 6th of 2006, and seeing her, my once beautiful mother in the hospital, skin and bone, it was heart breaking. Someone so full of life was only being stalked by the grim reaper. Slowly taking my mother, but instead of instantly taking her like the stories and illustrations show, he was toying with us by having her slowly die in immense pain these past 2 years. 

Observing my mother hooked up to all the medical equipment was like watching a dog consistently being chained to a tree. Unable to go anywhere and unable to enjoy life. Always tied to that tree waiting for death. You should feel either great relief or great pain when someone dies. I felt neither. As I watch my mother in pain take her last breath in and out and then she took no more, I knew she was gone. How could I feel anyway when she endured the worst pain of her life. Her eyes were still open. They looked like they seen the devil, like they seen fear itself, but I didn’t think anything of it. I let the hospital staff know that my mother was gone. The staff came in giving me their condolences. At that time my brother was in school. I didn’t want his last image of our mother to be hooked up to all this medical equipment. A nurse came back in and gave me the time of death, 13:13 (1:13pm).

I was only 24 at the time and only on the force for 3 years when my mother died in the hospital. My brother Michael was only 10 at the time. “Gabriel? Why did mom die? Did she not like living here with us and that’s why she got cancer?”. Talking to a 10 year old who just lost his mother was something that I would never be doing in my lifetime, let alone it be your brother. “No Michael. She absolutely loved us and wanted to stay. She was just really sick. I promise, she wanted to stay and see her only two children grow up, but she had a meeting with god that she could not miss.” Michael with his red eyes from crying so much and his nose also red from blowing it so much shook his head in agreement. My mother was religious, she believed in a heaven and hell, but the date stuck with me. Obviously, losing my mother was very traumatic, but the date 6/6/06  at 13:13 hours. Something was trying to tell me something. Maybe it was my mother beyond the grave telling me to be cautious. Or was it something else. 

Fast-forward to August of 2012. Six years after my mother died. I am now 30 and my brother grew up to be 16. Teaching him how to drive was like trying to teach a baby how to walk, but we bonded as what brothers do. “I wish mom was here to see me drive off”. “Michael, she is here with us and Im sure she is very proud of your accident free record. You know, your a better driver than when I first started.” Obviously lying to him, but he could use the boost. We drove all over the Bridgeville area until it was time for work. I usually had Michael drive home and I drive to work, but he got caught up on learning. I had Michael drive me to the police station. “Now when you drop me off, got straight home. You know your not supposed to drive without supervision. Remember 10 and 2…”. He interrupts me “I KNOW GABRIEL!!! You said it about a million times today. Gosh you sound just like mo…” and before he could get the words out. I scold him. “Im sorry Gabriel, it's just I miss her so much and you remind me of her so much.” As he pulls up to the BPD police station, I grab my black uniform, vest, and gun belt out of the trunk. Michael gets out of his car and hugs me. We have been doing this since I started police work. He was honestly my good luck charm. After we hug, I watch him get back in the driver’s seat and drive off toward the direction of home. 

Usually we are very busy, but this day August 13th was eerily calm. Hardly any calls from 22:00 which was the start of shift to 02:30 in them morning. At approximately 03:30 hours, usually this is time where me and my partner Ashton, go back to the station put a scary movie on and fall asleep. As I meet Ashton back at the police station we get a call for an older male who had fallen over and is requesting the police first. This older male was a known frequent faller, but he never requested police as these calls were usually medical calls. Since the medics were all taken up with other calls outside the jurisdiction, I figured me and Ashton could help him up. 

We arrived at his address which was 1313 Elm Street. This street always frightened, as I was watched Nightmare on Elm Street unsupervised as a child. The number on his house, was the same time my mother died. The hairs on the back of my neck stand up, goosebumps start to appear on my arms, and my stomach flips. Even though I had this feeling, I still had a job to do. The old mans house was the last one on the block. Walking up the 1902 two story white house was unnerving. It was the type of house that belonged in ghost stories.  His yard was unkept, and the mail was piling up in his mailbox. Both bad signs. Walking up to the house, we could see using our flashlights all the dead flies that lay on the windowsill on the inside of the window and a few still flying around the house. 

Knowing what we were walking into, myself and Ashton put Vaseline on our nostrils for the smell. Ashton checks around the house for any signs of forced entry. 

“There are no sins of any forced entry. I knew this guy was 80 something years old, but don’t you think its weird that yesterday his house was completely fine.” 

“The only want to find out is by going in and making sure he’s okay”. I said confidently, but I was scared as hell and I could tell Ashton was scared too. 

We open the front door, to find the house was in immaculate condition. The brown wooden floors appareled to be cleaned and mopped. The stairs did not have one ounce of dust on them. The glass chandelier had no spider webs on it. We saw candle light upstairs. 

“HELLO BPD POLICE DEPARTMENT!! ANYONE HERE?” I yell inside the seemingly empty and immaculate house. A faint moan came from upstairs. 

“Did you hear that? It sounds like it came from upstairs” I told Ashton. 

We walk through the house and up the steps towards the candle light. The moaning got louder the deeper we went in. The hallway seemed like it never ends. Every time we walked, it seemed it stretched 30 feet ahead, avoiding us from getting to our victim. I felt like a hamster on a wheel, always going. I start to sweat and feel sick. 

“hey man are you okay? It looks like your about to throw up?” Ashton said next to me. It was either the hallway or how thick the air has gotten the closer we got to our victim. 

With every step, it felt like I was walking through water which was getting thicker and thicker. Walking through the hallway, I noticed that the white walls were bare with no decoration on them. Just three doors on either side of the hallway. After what felt like 30 minutes of walking we get to the source of the moaning. The old man, was sitting Cris-cross in the middle of the room and completely naked. There were white candles in a circle pattern around him and his arms were held up in the air as if he was praying to something. The old man went from moaning to slowly praying. I listening closely to the prayers, but they weren’t anything that I know. He wasn’t speaking English, he was speaking latin. 

“Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversii, omnis congregatio et secta diabolica, in nomine et virtute Domini Nostri Jesu Christi, erue nos de inferno abyssi, tuple ut laqueis diaboli” the old man said. 

We both walked in the room. I saw in the front of him was a pentagram along with a ouija board, but there was something else that I was not too familiar with. There was a cardboard box and it was open. All these items were in front of him. The old man kept praying this over and over again. Each time getting faster and faster. I saw the candles whirl in the wind to the point of almost going out. The air in the room felt as if it was going to take out the house. I saw the planchette move on the ouija board “G..A..B..E..” I was in shock. Everyone called me Gabriel. The only person who called me Gabe was my mother…. 

“M..Mom? Is that you?” The air flow stops suddenly and the candles are blown out all at once. I jump back from standing over the old man to Ashton who was standing in the door way. I use my flash light and shine it on the old man. The praying has stopped. 

“Ashton, call dispatch on the radio and tell them to get the medics here.” 

“3232 to dispatch. Send medics to our location.” Fuzz. 

“3232 to dispatch. Send medics to our location!” I looked at Ashton in disbelief. This has never happened before. BPD had the best radio service in the area. You could be 4 miles under the ground and still have radio frequency. 

“Im going to step out of the room and try calling them on the radio. Keep your eye on the old man.” I said to him. I tried calling our dispatch 4 times on the radio with no luck. 

Sweating due to the heat in the house, confused about the radio, and frustrated I turn back to Ashton and walk towards him. As I stand next to him, I notice Ashton was frozen in place. His face white like the blood has gone from his head to his toes. 

“Hey man, it looks like you just seen a ghost.” I said to him humorously. Ashton who usually has quick come backs, is still frozen in place. He suddenly points in the direction of the old man. I take look at what he’s pointing at. It was the old man who was still in his original seated position, but he was staring at us. His head had completed a 180 degree turn and is now looking at us and smiling. His smile was from ear to ear and his eyes were black. You could start to see where the blood had started to pool under his skin from his broken neck. I saw it turn black and blue and purple. His eyes were pitch black as if he had no soul. 

I could see the pentagram behind him start to slowly glow red. The planchette was spinning in circles until it had fallen on selected letters 

“P..A..I..M..O..N”. 

Not thinking, the old man starts to seize. His erratic shaking and pounding on the ground sounding as if he was hollow. Myself and Ashton move in the room and help the old man. His neck was still broken. While he was shaking on the floor you could hear the bone on bone scraping from inside his neck. A clean break. Non one was surviving that. Then he let out a scream that almost no human could make. It had a low pitch, but was very loud to the point that our eardrums had almost burst. 

After a minute of seizing, he comes to complete stop. He wasn’t breathing, and with his neck broken he was for sure dead. Ashton had started CPR, but with my experience, and hearing the scraping of bone, he was for sure dead. I looked over to see the pentagram was not illuminated anymore and the planchette had stopped on the number 6. A number that was once my favorite number, now I am reminded of something horrific with that number. My mothers death. I looked next to the ouija board and saw the box which was still open. I looked in it and saw that it seemingly just went on forever. I closed it up and started to get photos of the scene. Coincidentally, we got radio service back. We advised out dispatch of the situation. 

After hours of being inside that house collecting evidence and photos of the now crime scene the shift was over. Not for me though, as I decided to stay for the morning shift. 

The morning shift went by as usual. Conducted a few traffic stops, answered all my calls. There was this little voice in the back of my head. “The box….The box….The box…” I could hear this voice. It was very convincing, but I knew the box was placed in the evidence room after we got back to the station last night. My curiosity mixed with fatigue and tiredness, was convincing enough to head back to the station to rest my eyes. 

Driving back to the station, my eyes were getting heavy as I was driving. I tried hard to get them to stay open. I blinked, an opened them to me driving in the wrong lane and almost in a head on collision. The horns of the other cars kept me awake for the rest of the drive to the station. The only thing I was thinking about was this damn box. 

I finally get back to the station and sit at my desk. No one was inside which made it perfect to fall asleep to. The only thing that was unsettling was the eerily quietness of the station. Usually the phones are ringing off the hook, but not now. It felt almost as it was last night. My curiosity got the best of me. I go to the evidence locker. There it is. The box. The box I saw last night. The box the old man had. I open the locker and reach for the box. Before I could touch it my phone goes off, scaring me. I drop the box on the floor. Michael was calling. I left the locker open and stepped outside of it. 

“Hey sorry for almost missing your call! Whats up?” I said to him somewhat out of breath. 

“He Gabriel, when are you coming home. I know your working a 16, but were out of food and I don’t want to drive anywhere without you.” He said. 

“I have another hour left and I'll be home. If you want since we live up the street, maybe you can drive and pick me up and we can get something to eat!” 

“Yeah sounds like a plan!” We hung up the phone. I looked at the evidence locker. The box still on the floor, but now it was open. I felt the air slowly going towards the box, like a vacuum. I close the box, the air flow stops an I place it back on the table. I walk away and I hear a whisper “…Gabe…” I felt like I was going crazy. Could it be my mother talking to me? I know it couldn’t because she’s been dead for 6 years. How was this possible. I sat down in my office chair and slowly started to undress my vest and belt for the end of the shift. Out of my better judgment, I took the box home. 

I saw Michael pull up and we went out to eat and then home. I was so exhausted from work I hit my bed and fall asleep. As I drifted off to sleep I heard my name again 

“….Gabe….” I answer back in my dream 

“Mom? Is that you?” 

“Son…. I miss you so much. Can you do me one favor?” 

“Anything mom. I miss you so much”. 

“I need you to eradicate your brother. He has been slandering my name behind your back”. 

“w….what? Im not killing my brother….” I suddenly awoke from my dream. I felt as if I got no sleep. The time was 3am and my brother was asleep in his room. I go to my living room and turn on the tv. My favorite show to fall asleep to was How Its Made on discover channel. The voice of the narrator was always so calming. 

I grab the box and place it in front of me. I contemplated opening it right then and there. My palms were sweating in anticipation, but I couldn’t do it. It was as if something was stopping me from opening it. Like there was some invisible wall was in-between me and the box. I started to watch the TV and heard a noise come from the kitchen. I walk to the kitchen and find that he sink was turned on. Not thinking about it, I turned it off and walked away. I started to walk to the living room when the sink turned on again. Thinking that Michael was playing tricks on me 

“Ok man knock it off. Im tired from work and your waisting water” I say aggressively. I turn the water off again and walked to Michaels room. I found him fast asleep in the same position that he was in the first time I checked on him. The water turns on again. My stomach sinks and my heart rate quickens. If Michael was sleeping in his bed, then who was turning on the water. 

I immediately grabbed my gun and started clearing my house. The water still on, I cleared one room after the other and until I get to the kitchen. I see the sink on and running. Once I know there is no other person in the house I had a slight calm to my nerves. I turn off the sink. I stare at the stink anticipating it to turn on. It turns on, only this time the water that was once clear if bright crimson red, the color of blood. I go to turn off the sink, but it doesn’t turn off. The faucet explodes sending the blood color water everywhere in the kitchen. On the ceiling, counter, walls, floor, and all over me. I was covered head to toe in it. I wipe my eyes and see the waterfall of blood coming from the sink as if there was something overflowing in the sink. The water finally calmed down, I stand up and look at the blood filled sink. I reach my hand in and search for the clog. I feel my way around the sink and finally find the garbage disposal. I check inside the garbage disposal for the clog. There was no clog. I go to pull my hand out, but I feel something tug at it stopping me from removing my hand. 

I grab my wrist with my other hand and pull hard with no luck. I start to panic. The one wait to release the water was to use the garbage disposal. Thinking on what to do, I look at the box as if it had the answers. I saw the box had opened and I saw a face look out of it and directly at me. I saw it slowly crawl out of the box. It looked human, but crawled on all fours like a dog. Its eyes glowed a crimson gold and had a golden crown of spikes on its head. I was terrified and speechless. I pulled my hand several times to break free, but the creature only got closer. As I was pulling my hand out I heard it breathing behind me and heard it speak 

“Honey… why do you hate me so much. You never remember me. You don’t love me” it sounded exactly like my mother. Tears rolling down my cheeks. It knew what it was doing and I fell for it. I pull my hand more, and the creature still using my mothers voice was getting closer to the point that it was standing right behind me. I felt its breath on the back of the neck. Its deep growl made me shake in fear. I closed my eyes. My gun too far away to reach I knew exactly where the kitchen knives were and grabbed one quietly. The creature still behind me I heard it say 

“You know you have to kill him. Kill him for your mother.” It said in her voice. I felt its hands on my shoulders that went to my arms. I open my eyes and with my free hand holding the sharp steak knife, below the creatures vision,  I jabbed it in its eye and plunge it in deep. My hand suddenly breaks free from the sink. I close my eyes and open them. I looked over at the box which was now closed. I looked behind me and saw the sink was intact with no blood everywhere. The sense of relief came over me, that I killed the creature that was behind me. I look down at the ground and saw the creature. But it wasn’t a creature, it was my little brother. The knife plunged deep in his eye socket. It was definitely lodged into his brain. Panic ensues me, and I start yelling at him. 

“MICHAEL! MICHAEL!! WHAT HAVE I DONE!!!” I got no response. Some blood started to bleed from his head, and I wiped it away. My brother, my brother who has helped me in more ways, died by my hand. 

I look over to the box, which was now open. I saw the face of the creature halfway out of the box. Its golden spiked crown and crimsons golden eyes looking straight at me. I didn’t know what to do. I stood there in shock. I saw Michaels body slowly start to slide towards the box as if there was an invisible string pulling on him. I followed his body. It slowly was dragged from the kitchen, through the dining room, and into the living room where the TV was still playing How It's Made. 

Michaels body finally reaches the box where he stopped. I saw Michaels body slowly stand up and fold in a way that I heard bone crunch and snap. His body was finally sucked into the box. His body was sucked and disappeared into the nothingness of black that was the inside of the box, never to be seen again. I passed out from what I had just seen. I was what seemed to be in coma for several days. I walk to Michaels room. He was not there. I walked into the kitchen and saw the blood trail that led to the box. I knew this was real and not a dream. After I woke up and gathered my thoughts it was 3 am again. 

Being a police officer I should be impervious to situations. It's what I was trained for. I was trained for almost anything and everything, but nothing like this. I cried for probably the first time since losing my mom. I prayed and prayed and prayed for something, but nothing happened. I only heard deep silent laughter coming from the box. I sat on the couch and stared at the box, which has not moved since it took my brother. 

I feel like I’m going crazy, but I know I am not. I had to tell someone about what had happened. I just killed my little brother. I saw the box open and the same creature stuck its head halfway out the box. 

“Paimon deserves another vessel worth his time. Send us another one and you shall be the next vessel.” It said in its demonic voice and went back in the box. It needed another vessel? What did that mean? I got flashes of the old man several days ago. How he was looking at me. Did he give me this burden or was it my poor decision making by taking this box home. Either choices were bad ones. 

Now truly alone, I had no other avenue to turn. I didn’t want this burden to bare, I must give it to someone else. I made my choice and the demonic voice could be heard out of the box. 

“You will go to the largest room in the house. Place several candles in the circle, draw the Goetic sigil for Paimon in front of you, sit in the circle completely naked and opened the box. Follow these in the correct order and you shall live”. The voice dissipated in the air. The air in the house got really heavy as if I was at 1313 Elm Street. I did what the creature instructed. After I made a quick phone call to 911. 

“Hello 911 what’s your emergency?” 

“I just killed my little brother. I live at 666 King way. Send everyone.” And I hung up. 

I sat criss cross and naked with the candles lit around me. I heard the sirens coming from the distance. Was this the way that I would go out or was I going to be shot by my fellow officers. I didn’t want to give anyone this burden, but if this was the only way then so be it. 

I lost my mother and now my brother. I have no one else. Sitting in my house in total darkness beside the light proved by the candles, I felt the rushing air that was circulating near the box. The creature opens the box and crawled out of it. It crawled out slowly. Its body contorted. Its arms were backwards and its back legs were the same way as a dog. Every movement its body cracked and broke. I saw its pointed crown and crimson eyes. Those eyes that held me in a trance. It crawled closer. Its long nails and toe nails clicking off the floor. I was trapped in fear. It crawled until it was right in front of me. It had a putrid smell of death and weeks old trash. Both of its hands gripped my head. 

“You were decided to be the vessel for our lord Paimon”. I started to tear up in not knowing what that meant. The creature put both of its hands in my mouth. I tried fighting back, but I was unable to move as if I was tied by something or being held down by someone. The creature grabbed the top and bottom of my mouth and opened. The creature kept opening my mouth until the point of breaking my jaw. I started to scream in pain as the creature kept opening my mouth. I heard a pop and a crack. I screamed in agony. My jaw was broke. Feeling the pain and the thumping of my broken jaw, the creature stopped opening my mouth, but kept its hands in my mouth. 

“As you are the vessel, you are rewarded with a gift”. The creature bent down its face close to mine. I saw it open its human light mouth. It had rows of sharpened teeth that were black, and it smelled of rotten food. I saw this thick goo like substance exit its mouth and enter mine. I choked on it. It felt like I was unable to breath, it clogged my airway. I felt it travel down my throat and into my nasal passage way. I was no unable to breath. Fighting for air I writhed in the clutched of what held me down. The creature was still filling my mouth with that goo until it overflowed. I had no choice but to swallow it. As I swallowed it, something came over me, as if my body was not in control of it self. 

The police finally arrival to my house. They bang on my door. The BPD knew whose house this was and what they were responding to. I didn’t want anyone of them to experience what I am going through, but I had no choice. 

“BPD POLICE MAKE YOURSELF KNOWN!!” They walk through the door and announce themselves again. I wanted to scream help, but I could only moan. I felt the goo still sliding down my throat and into my stomach. 

The BPD police finally make their way into the living room after clearing the house. I could tell that they were shocked at what they are looking at. One of their own, completely naked, acting crazy. I tried turning my head but I had no control over my body. I heard a familiar voice 

“Gabriel what happened to you?” It as the voice of Ashton. 

“Oh my god Gabriel, it's like the old man several days ago” Ashton said to the other officers at the scene. I tear ran down my left cheek. I felt the goo inside my stomach start to stir up. My body started to convulse and seize. I sat up straight after a minute of seizing. I had no control of my body. It was as if I was a puppet and there was an unidentified puppet master controlling me. 

I grabbed my head on both sides. My hands planted firmly on my head as if I was going to squeeze my brains out. I started to turn my head back where the police were standing. It got to the point where I could not turn it no more, but the puppet master kept pushing. I felt my neck strain and crack. 

“GABE NO!” Ashton said jumping towards me.

SNAP. CRUNCH. 

My neck snapped and everything went to black. 

At the scene the box was closed. Ashton who was emotional that he watched his friend kill himself, but he looked at the same box he saw at 1313 Elm Street several days ago. After the crime scene was processed and everyone went back to their respected police stations, Ashton couldn’t stop looking at the box in the evidence locker. 

He took it home. And so the cycle continues.
