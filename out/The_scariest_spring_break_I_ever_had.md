I woke up from bed, excited to start spring break. So I took a shower, ate breakfast, brushed my teeth, got dressed, and decided to go play golf and fishing. However, when I got to the golf course, which also had a nice stream for fishing, it mysteriously turned night. Then, my golf club and fishing rod somehow came to life.



I froze, and jumped back in fear.



“Why are you afraid of us?” asked the golf club.



“We’re just your golf club and fishing rod.” they both said.



“You cannot be real items!” I said. “You don’t even look realistic!” The second I said that, I looked at them, and they had even creepier faces. Their eyes were literally red dots, and blood was coming out both of their mouths. I wanted to run and get help, but there was nobody around!  
  


So I was literally trapped in the golf course with these two creepy objects that I could have been using, but instead, they seem like they wanted to kill me. Then they started to say to me:



“Feed us.”



“We’re famished.”



I didn’t know what to say or do. I wanted to pick them up and throw them into the river, but I was too afraid to do so, as they could have bit my hand off if I tried to pick them up. So I just ran to the vending machine and bought a chocolate bar, then gave it to those weird freaks of nature.



“What’s this?” they asked.



“It’s a chocolate bar!” I said. “Just eat it, you’ll like it!”



But they just stared at the chocolate bar. After realizing they weren’t gonna eat it, I picked it up and ate it myself. 



“Weren’t you gonna eat the chocolate bar?” I asked.



“No,” said the things. “Please give us something edible, like, maybe bring us an animal.”



“You know what? I’m not doing that.” I said as I just busted down the gate and ran away.



I had a whole list of stuff to do the next day.



Visit the Zoo

Go to the Fossil Museum

Eat frozen yogurt

Go to the Planetarium

Buy marshmallows



And I hoped nothing would ruin it. 



The next day, I visited the zoo. I saw all the animals. But just as I was about to go to the museum, the golf club and fishing rod ran away, and all the people ran for their lives, although a few people ended up getting eaten. However, the animals were all killed, but not all eaten. I saw a dead ostrich. I saw a zebra. I saw a caracara and a kookaburra next to each other. I saw a capybara.



Man, would they follow me everywhere I went? I froze, then somehow, it turned night again. Then all the dead zoo animals and staff turned into zombies.



ZOMBIES?!?



I admit, it’s pretty fun when you read books about zombies, maybe watch movies like Night of the Zoopocalypse, but now that I was in an actual zoo with actual undead animals, it was no laughing matter. The animals started chasing me, with the golf club and the fishing rod leading them. 



The next day, I headed to the museum. I saw so many cool dinosaurs and other extinct animals, like the Ornithomimus. After leaving, I was waiting for it to become night again as expected, but nothing happened. Then, some strange blue light enveloped the museum, and then the you-know-whats started running out of the museum, the fossils and dinosaur displays, who have been brought to life, ran out. The golf club was riding on the Ornithomimus, while the fishing rod was riding a Giant Moa. 



I ran for my life and outran them. I then headed to the frozen yogurt place and ordered chocolate frozen yogurt with gummy worms on top. But just as I finished eating, they showed up. The staff ran for their lives as the yogurt machines and toppings were brought to life. So I ran.



I went to the planetarium and looked at cool displays, and of course, the golf club and fishing rod showed up after I left. They brought the space displays to life, and the people ran for their lives, of course. I quickly ran and bought my marshmallows, and then of course, they came to the store and brought all the marshmallows (except the ones I bought) to life. I quickly ran away.



 I ran into the woods and stopped to catch my breath. I ended up staying there, so it was nighttime. Then I walked into the woods to use the bathroom there, and after finding a bush, I was about to start peeing when I heard them coming. So I quickly zipped up my pants, but after I did so, they were literally right in front of me. I was so shocked, I peed myself, but I didn’t care, as peeing your pants was way better than being eaten. Seriously, I could die by drowning in an ocean, but instead I was gonna get eaten by a golf course. People would be laughing at my funeral!



I was seriously about to accept death when I heard the screech of a hawk. So I copied the screech, sending everything back to normal. The animals were back to the zoo, normal, the fossils and space displays were back in their museums, the marshmallows were back in the supermarket, the frozen yogurt stuff were back in place, and most importantly, the gold club and fishing rod were back to normal! 



I could finally enjoy myself, but still, this is your warning:



If your golf club and fishing rod come to life…



**DON’T LISTEN TO THEM.**
