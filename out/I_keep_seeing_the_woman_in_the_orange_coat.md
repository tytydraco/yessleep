I (25f) recently started a new job at a theme park, sound fun? Wrong. My job is in the ticket booth in front of the park. Take your money, give you the tickets, done. Over and over again, 8hours a day, 5 days a week. However, money is money and I need it.
Okay so hopefully you get the picture now.
Over the last week there was a Halloween theme at the park and it brought a lot of attraction, more than I had experienced yet. It was a little nerve wracking.

Monday morning it began, I must admit I arrived late by oversleeping. I got a earful from my boss, he’s a bit of a dick. I quickly put my belongings in my locker and headed to the booth.
On my way there I noticed how big the line was, but among the line was this woman with a vibrant orange coat, she obviously stood out beyond anyone else, it was a real fashion statement.
I chuckled to myself at it and planned on complimenting her when she finally got to the window. I knew I wouldn’t forget when she would come because a lady with a buggy and small child was in front of her in the line.
I carried on as usual, get money, give tickets, next customer.
Finally the lady with the buggy turned up at my window, I smiled and greeted her, asked for how many tickets, she paid, I gave the tickets and told her to have a lovely time.
I put the money into the cash register, smiling to myself, in my head preparing what to say to this lady.
I turned ready to speak, to see a middle aged man with his teenage son. It was quite obvious that i was confused. 

Man: are you alright ma’am?

Me: uhh yes, my apologies. How many tickets?
I said with the most awkward smile. 
I could swear orange coat was next. I looked out my window to see the woman 4 people back. 
Huh that’s weird, but I shrugged it off to me either getting it wrong or she moved, maybe for someone to go in front of her or she moved back to talk and wait with someone else.
I poked my head out to see a man talking to her. Okay, confirmed she moved back to talk to someone.

I continued doing my job, not really thinking of orange coat, not really feeling in the mood to compliment her when she gets to the window anymore.
A couple of minutes go by and the person stood in front of me was the man who was talking to orange coat with a different woman. I shoot my head out the window to see orange coat 5 people back. I quickly return my gaze to the man in front of me. 

Me: excuse me? Do you know that woman with the orange coat? 
I pointed down the line. 
He looked confused. 

Man2: um I’m sorry I don’t. 

Me: but I thought I saw her in front of you earlier and you were talking to her? 

The woman next to him also became confused. 

Man2: ma’am I’m sorry, but I’ve never seen that woman before.

The woman spoke up and clarified to me that orange coat was never in front of them. 
I felt cold, I’ve never felt a shiver go up my spine so fast.
This freaked me out for the rest of my shift, every time it would be her turn, she would end up about 4 or 5 people back. 
Everyone looked at me like I was insane, ever so often shooting my head out the window of the booth to find orange coat further away. 

My coworker noticed my odd behaviour throughout the day and asked me what was going on at the end of my shift. I explained everything to her and she suggested I check the security cameras tomorrow to see what orange coat was doing all this time. It could be a Halloween prank she also said. I thought about it and thanked her before heading back to my flat. I tried not think about it while home, I cooked dinner, took a shower and got into bed to watch Netflix on the tv.
I must of dozed off at some point back when I awoke it was 7am. 

I got to work early and asked my manger if I could check the camera from yesterday because I believe someone was pranking me. He rolled his eyes but agreed. I scanned the footage from Monday, and to my horror orange coat was no where to be found in any time of the day. 
My manager said I looked pale and spaced out after. I got a bottle of water and went to the booth to start the day. 
Orange coat was there again, always appearing further away. This happened everyday for that week. 

I quit on Friday and have been searching everywhere for this type of phenomenon happening to anyone else, and I’ve ended up here. So please, if you have any explanation for this or experienced something similar I would love to hear it.
Also I keep seeing glimpses of orange in the corner of my vision, it happens in my home and sometimes randomly outside. 
Please help.
