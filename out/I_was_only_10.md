I was 10. It was a normal day. A late evening. Nothing special, at least not yet. This evening was unusually gloomy, I remember peeking through the curtains draping over my window, seeing the moon shining in the sky, the dark clouds crowding it, as if trying to mute the brightness. I was home alone, my parents had a few things they needed to take care of and I was responsible enough to look after myself for a few hours. They said they wouldn't be long, and I was completely fine with it. That was until I heard the noises. 

I was playing in my room, music blasting from my beaten up, retro radio. Completely in my own world. It has been about 3 hours since my parents left. I thought they're taking a bit longer than I expected, but I let it slide - knowing that sometimes these kinds of things can drag. 

I told myself not to worry, and that they'll be back soon. That's when I saw the lights outside of the house. 

It was a car pulling into our driveway. As my curtains weren't fully closed, I saw the rays of the headlights, beaming through my window. I was happy knowing they're finally back, the big house could feel so eerie sometimes, with only a little me in it. 

I can't lie, I was a little bit nosey, curious at that age. Who wouldn't be? You're only just starting to truly experience the world. I paused my favourite track, and whilst still playing with my toys - I started listening. 

I heard the key turn in the door, the door slowly opening. I then heard what sounded like my parents taking off their shoes and quite a shushed conversation, it almost sounded heated. The door slammed, followed by the sounds of footsteps slowly making their way to the salon. Another door slam.

I was confused, my parents ALWAYS greet me. They'd never just come home and not say hi, not say a single word. I thought maybe they're having an argument and they need some space. I tried to wait it out, it's been around 5 minutes since I heard the door unlock. I can still hear voices coming from the salon. I really wanted to wait it out, but my curious child mind couldn't handle another minute. 

I opened my door slightly, the hallway was completely dark, the conversation I've been hearing the entire time - has suddenly stopped. I looked through the gap in my door but I didn't see any rays of light coming from the salon. I was understandably extremely disoriented and confused. 

I hesitantly started making my way down the hallway, almost on my tip-toes. Trying hard to stay quiet. Trying hard to not freak out. The closer I got to the salon, the quieter it got. 

By the time I was by the salon door, the whole house was overtaken by complete silence. No lights. No sounds. Nothing. 

My body couldn't move, it was almost as if every cell in my body came to a halt, my blood froze in place. All I could feel was the dizziness. The white noise in my ears, pitching higher and higher. My legs tingling and my skin burning, all from pure fear. 


Did I not just hear them? 
Did I imagine it all?
I swear I could hear their voices. 
Hundred of thoughts were running through my head. It was truly a fight or flight response. 

I directly faced the salon door now, it was so much bigger than me. I felt so small, so helpless but I couldn't stop myself. I shut my eyes as tightly as i could and swung open the door, flicking the light on as soon as I could. My blood was not frozen anymore, it was rushing through every part of my body. I could feel it getting quicker and quicker, my heartbeat ringing in my ears. 

I slowly and cautiously opened my eyes, letting them adjust to the bright ceiling light. I looked around, dazed. 

There was no one there, the room was untouched. 

I started trembling. 

I swear..I swear I heard their voices, their footsteps. They were here! Did they leave again?

There was only one way to find out.

I pulled out my phone - it was a basic model, mainly just so I could call my family if needed. I dialled my mum.

 Each ring felt like an eternity - then she finally picked up. 

"Hello, sweetie?"

"Hey, mum. Did you go out again?"

"Again? What do you mean?"

"I heard you come in about 20 minutes ago, but when I went to check - there was no one there". 

Silence. 

It was almost as if my mum was too terrified to speak. 

"Honey, lock all the doors. We will be right there."

My hands were barely keeping a hold of the phone, they were shaking. They were shaking so much.

I heard the call drop. Followed by an echo through the house.

An echo of someone calling my name...
