[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ouczh/i_got_lost_in_the_woods_when_i_was_nine_years_old/)

A handful of incidents happened before I emerged from college, nothing new or meaningful though. Just more reminders of how trapped I was.

By the time I was out, I knew what I had to do. 

I returned home, ostensibly taking a break to reconnect with family before going back out into the world. 

In reality, I was planning to end this tireless struggle between myself and a single moment in my childhood. 

First of all, I tried to talk to my mother about it. One day over breakfast I brought the topic up. It wasn’t hard. When you’re back home with family for the first time in a long while, reminiscing about old events is as natural as eating.

“Do you remember that time I got lost in the woods out back?” I started. 

“Oh yes. When you were six.” She nodded.

“No?” I chuckled. “We lived in a third-story apartment in the city when I was six. I was definitely nine.”

“You would have been six in…” she trailed off as she ran the numbers in her head. “We would have been in that housing block then, not that awful apartment.” She declared with certainty.

“Okay, you’re right.” I admitted. It was true, but it was also entirely beside the point. “But the woods, you always warned me away from going in there. I’m just curious. I’m sure you remember how freaked out I was that day. Had you heard anything about them? Like stories, or crimes in the news or something?” 

“No.” She seemed confused by the question. “I just didn’t want you playing alone in there. You could have easily gotten lost or hurt. I was just lucky you only ended up doing one of those.” 

She looked at me curiously.

“Did something happen in there you never told me about?” 

“No.” I shook my head. I wasn’t really lying. I’d told her the whole story about the day and the nightmare’s thereafter long ago anyway. It wasn’t really a lie. “The whole thing just really messed me up. I just still think about it sometimes.” I greatly downplayed how it affected me even then, of course. 

I had no convenient clues to go on, no mystery to face.

Only me, my dreams, and the woods. 

I’ve returned to the outskirts many times since. The trees are so remarkably mundane, that little patch of forest so remarkably dull it is almost hard to believe that misty glade lies inside. It took me weeks to build up the courage to step inside. 

During that time, I willingly chose to experience one more dream, this time as close as I could go to where it all started.

I walked to the edge of the woods, laid myself down, and went to sleep. 

I woke up lost in the woods, nine years old, never moving, never changing.

I clawed at the dirt. I scrambled over roots. 
The world turned dark the monster chased me.

Everything was nauseously familiar, even if my childhood brain could only grasp a fragment of it. 

Then, things changed. I somehow found myself broken free of the old woods. I was running home through familiar pine. A small, deeply hidden part of me knew that I was reaching something critical, that I was getting near something that would answer everything.

My one life and my other were finally nearing each other.

Then, as light began to pierce to trees once more and I could see the edge of the woods, I was snatched back. I was pulled back into the darkness mere seconds from triumph. 

I woke up as I had a hundred times before: with a scream.

It was taunting me.

It can stop me from ever leaving those woods.

And if it can hold me there forever more, then I have only one choice.

I have stepped inside. As it whispers to me that I will never leave, I will answer loudly and with certainty that I will enter. 

I am writing this as the signal slowly fades with the sun's light as I step deeper and deeper amongst the trees. The only equipment this explorer needs for his expedition is a canister of gasoline and a lighter. 

I can’t live like this. Haunted.

Cursed.

Trapped. 

I will step into that glade. I will tell them that I was just a boy, and I did nothing wrong. That I will be free. 

There were witches in those woods.

But there will not be tomorrow.

Goodbye.
