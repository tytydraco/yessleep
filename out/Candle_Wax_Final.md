“So, let me see if I got this right...” Gray began as we drove down the dark road. “Cult from the 80s kills some kids with hot wax as part of an unsuccessful satanic ritual. Harmony’s pops and this priest get way into that business. Dude has a kid and they make her drink goat’s blood from the fuckin’ holy grail to make her special, whatever that means. And then they have her play some kid’s game that they made up in order to turn her into some kind of demon zombie slave so she can do the ritual properly. And she... astral... projects... herself into your dreams to try and help you stop them.”

 

“Or something like that.” I responded.

 

“Well when you put it like that it’s all very fucking rational. And you DON’T want backup?”

 

“This isn’t gonna be a fire fight, Gray. Backup will only complicate things. I’d go alone if I could.”

 

“Yeah that ain’t happening.”

 

“I didn’t think so. You’re far too stubborn.”

 

“I’m the stubborn one, okay.” Gray said with biting sarcasm.

 

“You are.” I asserted.

 

“I think I have been pretty goddamn amenable through this process, all things considered.”

 

“Okay, let me pick the song then.”

 

“It’s my car, it’s my radio. Get some headphones if it bothers you.”

 

“See?”

 

“No that’s not stubborn, that’s just the rules of the road.”

 

“It’s not a rule, you’re just a prick.”

 

“It’s a rule, ask anyone.”

 

“I was almost murdered, twice. I had thumbtacks in ALL of my holes... You won’t give me one song?”

 

“You don’t get a song. We roll in your car, you can pick the songs. That’s how it works.”

 

“Okay let’s roll in my car then.”

 

“No, your car is a piece of shit.”

 

“Unreal.”

 

We made a left and I could see the building coming into view. For a moment I almost forgot we were driving to the devil’s doorstep. Maybe that’s why a guy like Gray is good to have around.

 

We parked out front. The lights were off and the sign in the window said closed. “Blessings” loomed over us. The meaning of that word had corrupted.

 

“Know how to pick a lock?” Gray asked.

 

“I do actually.” I answered, producing some of the hair pins and bending them accordingly before jimmying them inside the lock. After a few moments, it clicked and the door opened easily.

 

“We’re probably both gonna be fired for all this.” Gray said.

 

“Probably... I imagine the pizza place would take you back though.”

 

We quietly made our way inside, guns drawn, past the small foyer and the rows of cafeteria seating. Seeing places like this so dark and empty never stops being unsettling. The absence of life where life should be.

 

We moved to the back area, into the kitchen. The most modern looking part of the building. We eventually came upon a door to a basement, tucked away in the very back. This was it.

 

The door was locked, but I made quick work of that. It opened into a dark, wooden staircase. Leading down into a blanket of blackness. I began to take a step down, but Gray stopped me.

 

“Hold on.” He whispered. “Let me go first.”

 

“Why? Why do you have to go first every time?”

 

“Because I can be a human shield. Someone shoots me, you have time to get away. You’d be a terrible human shield, you’re like 50 pounds. Someone shoots you, it’ll rip through you like paper and kill us both.”

 

“...Okay fine, whatever, go.”

 

Gray made his way down into the dark and I followed close behind. The steps creaked more than I wanted, but it seemed like no one was home. Or at least, no one was awake.

 

Gray held my shoulder as we walked into the pitch black void. I could only hear our breathing.

 

“Flashlight?” He whispered to me.

 

“Go.”

 

Gray clicked the flashlight on and it illuminated a dank, half furbished living space. The floor was grey concrete, and the ceiling was a patchwork of Styrofoam ceiling tiles. There was a small kitchenette, a bathroom, and a bachelor style living room/bedroom combo. It confirmed that someone did indeed live here, but at a glance it didn’t confirm much else.

 

Convinced that no one was here, we turned on the overhead light to get a better look and do some rummaging. For the overall grungy state of the place, whoever lived here did like to keep it tidy.

 

“You think Harmony’s father lives here like this?” Gray asked.

 

I shrugged. “I’ve lived in worse.”

 

“Yeah, shit, I have too. I would have killed for a place like this in my teens.”

 

My eyes were eventually drawn to the desktop computer set-up in the corner. The first notable detail in this room.

 

“Gray, take a look at this.” I said, motioning towards the desk.

 

“Yeah that’s not bad, huh?”

 

“Double monitors... and I’d wager that’s a thousand-dollar tower at least. Maybe two. Custom build.”

 

“Most expensive thing here, no doubt.”

 

I took a closer look inside the glass side of the PC. “I’m no expert, but that graphics card looks pretty monstrous... So either he’s one of those ‘PC Master Race’ guys, or he has a lot of visually intensive work to do here.”

 

“I mean finding a good PC in a dingy basement isn’t exactly rare. This could realistically be anyone’s nephew living here.”

 

I eagerly pressed enter on the keyboard and woke it up. I was faced with a basic looking lock screen, but not a familiar one. Maybe Linux. Nevertheless, it was password protected and the profile was unnamed.

 

I tried a few basic passwords. ‘TheFather’. ‘CandleCaine’. Harmony’s date of birth. No dice.

 

“Dead end then?” Gray asked.

 

“No... This is it. This is our guy, and this is his fucking workstation.”

 

“Look, I think you’re right... But he ain’t here, and Harmony ain’t here. It doesn’t look like any rituals were performed here either. I don’t see them conjuring Satan next to the goddamn pull out sofa.”

 

“Well we have to find them! We have to find them now!”

 

“I know, but what do you want me to do!?”

 

“I don’t know... Okay... we wait for him to come back, and we force him to take us to her.”

 

“Whitley died before giving us anything.”

 

“Then so be it. If he doesn’t give us anything, I’ll kill him. One less piece of shit on the board.”

 

“Jesus, Cole. Let’s not-“

 

Gray’s words were interrupted by the slow creaking of a door on the other side of the room. Both of our eyes widened, and we looked toward the sound.

 

There he was. Brad. Harmony’s father. Emerging from what looked like a hidden door amongst the wood paneling. He looked slightly different than the man I had seen on his social media, with a 5 o’clock shadow and cavernous dark circles under his eyes not hidden behind his thick brimmed glasses.

 

His expression mirrored ours. One of shock and dreadful anticipation. A tense second followed where none of us moved. I was first to draw my gun.

 

“Hands above your head!” I shouted. Gray followed suit and pulled his weapon. Brad, to my bewilderment, frantically raised his hands.

 

“Wait! Wait, wait, wait.” He said, appearing to cower. “You shouldn’t be here!”

 

“What is that door? Where did you come from!?” Gray demanded.

 

“Where’s Harmony!?” I yelled over him.

 

“Okay, okay, okay. Just don’t shoot. Please.” Brad uttered meekly.

 

“Get on the ground, and put your hands behind your back, right fucking now!” Gray said, and Brad quickly obliged. Gray cuffed him and then hoisted him to his feet.

 

“What’s behind that door?” Gray asked again.

 

“Don’t... Don’t... You shouldn’t...” He pleaded.

 

“Take us back there, now.” I commanded.

 

“I’m sorry, detective. I didn’t want this.” He said while looking directly at me. I saw the same eyes I saw behind that goat mask.

 

I was taken aback and pissed off beyond belief. “Are you fucking kidding me? You didn’t want this? Look at me. I still taste the metal, you son of a bitch. You didn’t want that? No, I’ll tell you what you didn’t want. You didn’t want me to still be fucking breathing. But I am. So right now, you need to start giving me some damn good reasons why I shouldn’t put a bullet in your mouth.”

 

“That wasn’t me!”

 

“Bullshit. I saw you. I saw your eyes. Don’t play dumb with me. You raised your daughter to be part of a goddamn satanic ritual.”

 

“I didn’t know what it was!” He whined. “Whitley... he was my friend. I didn’t know what he was doing to her. Not at first. But then he showed me things. Insane things. He told me she was special. That she was chosen. That the end was coming and she was the key to our survival. I... I believed him. So I helped him. I left everything and I moved in here. He said our work would keep her safe, and that when she was ready she would come back to us. She would resurrect The Father and he would save us from damnation.”

 

“Oh that’s horseshit.” Gray said.

 

“I know! It was all a lie! I know, because the thing that came back to us was not my daughter. It was something else... The apocalypse was bullshit, it was never about that. But it had already started. I didn’t know what to do. If I made a move, he would know. So I stayed close. Close to her. Hoping maybe I could get her back. I helped fake her videos. I helped buy time while they... prepared. I didn’t want to kill you, detective. I didn’t want to hurt anyone. But that’s what Harmony was for... That’s what they got wrong the first time.”

 

“What did they get wrong? Who are they?”

 

“The Cult of the Father. Whitley was obsessed. The cult, they... they wanted to find reality beyond reality. They believed that spiritualism was the way. All spiritualism. Religious iconography. They used satanic imagery, but they didn’t believe in Satan. They believe in... belief. They believe that if you broaden your mind, your spirit, your belief, you could open yourself up to higher beings. You could be touched. You could be visited. That’s why they used candles. Candles are used in all kinds of spiritual practices, they hold tremendous symbolic power. They spoke to their higher beings through candles. But that’s only half of the equation. They wanted more, but they didn’t know...”

 

“Go on...” I said sternly, not releasing my grip on the gun.

 

“They only thought about the spiritual side. But Whitley, he studied more. He found people who sought the same end through different means. Spiritual AND biological. Two sides of the same coin. He studied the work of Darren Barbeau. Supposedly he reached the higher reality through means of science, biology, even botany. So Whitley combined them. The Holy Father, and Mother Nature. The iconography of great holy chalices and goat’s blood, imbued with a brain altering drug cocktail, medicinally prescribed, until it could grow inside her like a seed.”

 

“But what was it for?”

 

“Everything. Once Whitley activated her with that stupid little game, the other side took hold. Her blood got added to the cocktail, and it was so much stronger than it was before. I told you I didn’t want to hurt you... but when you drink it... He only made me drink it a few times and that’s what I did, but more you take it, the longer it lingers.”

 

“Whitley was dead before you tried to kill me. He didn’t make you drink anything.”

 

“I didn’t mean Whitley... “

 

“...What? Who do you mean then? Who’s ‘he’?”

 

Brad lowered his head and held his tongue.

 

“Tell me. Now. I’m in no fucking mood.”

 

Brad let out a deep sigh and finally muttered, “Caine.”

 

“Caine? The dead cult leader?”

 

“Listen, I’ve told you everything... Please get me out of here. If he knows I talked...”

 

“So he’s here then.”

 

“That door leads to a sub-basement. Yes. He’s down there. With her. He’s feeding. It’s the only window we get. Please, we have to go. There’s nothing you can do here.”

 

“No. We’re going down there, and you’re coming with us. And if you’re fucking with me about all this, I promise I will kill you.”

 

“There’s nothing you can do! My daughter is gone! I tried! I tried so many times to reach her, but she’s not there anymore! If we go down there, he will kill us all!”

 

“If we leave, he will never stop coming for us. You know that. No one will ever be safe.” I rebuked.

 

“You’re making a mistake.”

 

“Let’s go. And by the way, don’t think for one second you’re innocent in all this. If what you’re selling me is true, you knew and you did nothing. You could have stopped this. You could have fought. You’re a fucking coward.”

 

Brad didn’t say another word, Gray held him by the arm as we opened the door and made a right to a steep, stone staircase. Orange light flickered at the bottom as we descended.

 

We turned another right at the bottom of the stairs and the sight before us was ungodly. A crude, stone shrine. Painstakingly carved arches in the walls, lined in gold paint. Adorned in a multitude of symbols, iconographies, and tapestries from many religions. Many of the same symbols we saw on those trees out in the woods. There was a perimeter of multiple levels of lit candles. At the back of the long, rectangular room, in the center, sat a big stone slab. An altar of some kind. What laid upon it was harder to describe.

 

I recognized Harmony’s ghastly form. She laid on her back on the slab, adorned in a ghostly thin white gown. Her face still twisted into that awful smile. The thing above her... I did not recognize. Human in shape, but not in detail. Its skin was pale, impossibly smooth, almost translucent and... dripping... He can’t wear human skin...

 

It laid atop her, and it was feeding. Its mouth pressed against her empty eye socket and... slurped. I could hear it. The sucking, wet cascade as it drank.

 

I thought about shooting it but... I knew deep down that it wouldn’t do a damn thing. What could I do? The moments in which we weren’t noticed were fleeting. I had to think fast.

 

“You have her eye...” Brad whispered. I turned to see him staring at me, jaw agape. “She’s still with us...”

 

I nodded in response.

 

Brad turned his head back towards the altar, and then back to me again. I could see gears turning. His eyes and mine locked, and I saw within them his intentions. I saw sorrow, I saw regret, and I saw a new found conviction. A hope where there hadn’t been any before. He believed that I could get her back. In his belief, I found my own.

 

His eyes issued me one final direction.

 

“Tell her I loved her...”

 

Before I could contemplate stopping him, he had broken from Gray’s grip and sprinted across the room towards the unholy thing. Screaming something both primal and anguished.

 

The thing turned its head and I saw what primitive manner of a face that it had. Just a trio of sagging, cavernous, black holes for eyes and a mouth. A permanent state of melting gloom. Brad pulled the beast off of his daughter, shouting all manner of incomprehensible garble as he entangled with it.

 

Gray ran after Brad and the man of wax, and I ran for Harmony. I pulled her off the stone slab and dragged her limp body to a corner, away from the chaos. Beyond that, I wasn’t sure what I would do.

 

She smiled at me, that same evil smile, though her body appeared completely physically drained from being fed upon.

 

“Harmony!” I yelled, trying somehow to break past whatever had overtaken her.

 

She let out a weak giggle, “Candle Caine, Candle Caine, Candle Caine.” Repeated in a playful sing-song.

 

I wasn’t sure if the inspiration came from myself, or from someone else in my head... but I knew in that moment what I had to do.

 

“It’s weak, Harmony. It’s drained. Take it back...” I said aloud, hoping the real Harmony could hear me, before producing one more hairpin from my pocket.

 

I heard Gray shout in agony. I quickly glanced over. He was on the ground, writhing in pain. I saw lots of red, but I couldn’t make out the extent of the damage. The thing had Brad’s skull tight in the grasp of both of its lanky primordial hands, and he was screaming. But his screams were silenced, when the thing’s mouth clasped around his left eye. I heard squelching and popping and slurping. Like what it had been doing to Harmony, but so much more violent. It was nauseating... But not as nauseating as what I had to do next.

 

I turned back to the twisted Harmony, and said it once more. “Take it all back.”

 

I pulled my left eyelid down, and plunged the hairpin underneath it, sinking it into the pink meat under my eye. The adrenaline didn’t hide the pain. The feeling of metal inside flesh never gets any less uncomfortable. I pushed the pin further inside and began to press down, using my ocular cavity like a fulcrum. My eye began to awkwardly bulge out and my vision got fuzzy.

 

I felt each end of the pin wrap around the string on the back of my eye. The tingling sensation of the touching and tearing of exposed nerves sent shockwaves through my body. I had to finish this fast.

 

With one quick push down and pull back, my eye dislodged from its home completely and dangled free against my cheek. Without any further hesitation, I snapped the cord with my fingernail and severed the link. I held the slimy, squishy, baby blue eye in my hand. Then I pried open the lids of Harmony’s empty socket, and slipped it inside cord-first.

 

It was a struggle to get it to hold in place, but I could feel her skull begin shifting. It was like her body was coercing it back into place. One I got the lids folded over, something began to change. She began to shake and convulse violently. Her mouth began foaming. I worried that I had just killed her. Had I just sent the last vestige of her soul to die?

 

I looked to the beast once more, just in time to hear a sickening crunch as Brad’s skull was compressed to pieces between its hands. All while the wax thing continued to drink. Like squeezing the last bit of juice from a juice box.

 

When he had gotten it all, he tossed his husk of a body aside like a rag doll. Then he came for Gray. I had to distract him. I rose to my feet.

 

“Caine!” I yelled. It got its attention.

 

“That’s who you are, isn’t it?” I continued. “You’re Mr. Caine. It’s your bones underneath that wax. Whitley dug you up, didn’t he?”

 

The beast slowly stalked towards me, as I backed off at the same pace. Gray got to his feet and silently moved somewhere I couldn’t see.

 

“You were always the ritual, weren’t you? You wanted to bring someone back from the dead. Bring their consciousness back from the other side, so they could show you and guide you to the promised land. Well now you’ve been there and back. What can you show me?”

 

The thing didn’t falter. It continued to stalk at the same pace. I was quickly running out of room, but I had also talked myself into a revelation.

 

“You led yourself to this didn’t you? You wanted to find The Father... But you were The Father. You spoke to Whitley from the other side, but you also spoke to yourself from the other side. A place beyond time and space. You worshipped yourself. This was always the endgame... Well, was it everything you wanted?”

 

The thing jutted its arms out and gripped either side of my head, just like it did Brad’s. Its fingers were crude, jagged, and spindly. Somehow both solid and liquid at the same time. I stared into its black holes of eyes... and I could see the abyss staring back at me. The glimmer of something alive deep within. Deeper than physically possible. Then it raised its mouth to me, past my vision’s edge, to feed from my empty socket.

 

I felt the suction begin, and it was like a vacuum. Something like a long, hot, wet tongue tickled at the inside of my skull and wormed towards my brain. Those awful tingling shockwaves began again. My entire body felt like pins and needles, even more so than when it was actually full of pins and needles.

 

Something severed the connection. The sucking stopped, the tongue rescinded, and the grip on my head loosened. I dropped to my knees, and looked up to see what had happened.

 

Harmony was wrestling with the beast. She had the chalice in her hand, trying to force it to drink something. I saw that her hand was bleeding.

 

Gray jumped into action and tried holding the thing down. I wondered where he had gone. In a final, frustrated gasp, Harmony plunged the entire chalice into its gaping maw. Then the beast went still.

 

Somehow I knew what she had done. Maybe I had just attuned myself to the insanity, but I knew. She poisoned the well. It used her blood when she was corrupted to strengthen the bond to the other side, but now she was whole again. Purged of the infection. Her soul intact, and her soul was dangerous. They spent all that time making her special, and in the end she was too special.

 

Harmony collapsed. She had either passed out or was very close to it. I tried to pull her away towards the stairs as best as I could. Gray helped us both, though the claw marks in his chest looked horribly deep.

 

The creature began to stir... but more than that, it began to bubble. Its waxy flesh lost its stability and form. A torrent of blood began to rush out of its mouth and trickle form its eyes. A complete bodily rejection. But it didn’t scream. It couldn’t. It could only gurgle.

 

I saw its waxy form begin to flake and the texture slowly changed. Squiggles of veins began popping up. It started to wrinkle and become dotted with pores. It was growing human skin... Her blood was making it human... It can’t wear skin.

 

I shuffled myself and Harmony’s half-conscious body towards the exit, but Gray instead confidently stepped towards it. He brandished a bottle of olive oil. He had gone upstairs to get it.

 

He tossed it at the bubbling, bleeding monstrosity with enough force that it managed to shatter against the softened and pulsating waxy skin. The oil spilled, covering the ground.

 

I grabbed one of the lit candles and we began to move up the stairs as the thing continued to writhe and transform.

 

I gave the candle a soft toss into the oil, and the flames lit instantly. We hurried our way up the stairs and through the basement as fast as we could, but then I stopped.

 

“Get her out, I’ll be right behind you.” I called out to Gray.

 

“What? Fuck that, let’s go!” He protested.

 

“Go! I’ll be right there! I just have to get something! Go, now!”

 

Gray shook his head and continued helping Harmony towards the second set of stairs. I moved to Brad’s computer. I didn’t have the strength left to lug the whole thing. I just had to get the hard drive out before all the evidence went up in flames. Maybe the only chance Harmony would have.

 

I forced open the case and dug out the SSD, but then I saw the fire creeping in through the hidden door. With it, I saw Caine. The body still barely clinging to its human form in a painstaking effort. The skin burned away, and the wax melted off him in droves. I began to see the vestiges of muscle and tissue forming and burning at an equal rate within.

 

“I...” Caine attempted to speak through his gurgling. “I can... make you...”

 

I tried to turn away and run, but suddenly I couldn’t. I still saw those hellish eyes, deep in the recesses of his black, cavernous sockets, and they had a hold of me. There was something within them. Something beyond reality, and he was showing it to me. One last ditch effort but I couldn’t resist it.

 

The walls fell away. Everything fell away. Even him, and even me. All I saw was an ocean. It stretched further and wider than the earth. And it was empty. Nothing but the crashing of the waves. It was vast, but then in an instant it was tiny. It was nothing. It was a glass of water. Filled to the top.

 

I tipped it just a little bit and it spilled out on a concrete floor. I looked again just a little bit later and the spill had evaporated into a damp spot. I looked a third time and it had grown into a sickening mold. Within the mold were thousands of screaming faces.

 

The mold grew into a mossy bog. The bog grew into a dense forest. The trees muffled the screams, and suddenly it was empty again. It flooded and became an ocean once more. No sound, no life. I was alone, but I didn’t even exist anymore.

 

He didn’t speak to me, but his words wormed their way into me. Not in sound, but in feeling. “I can make you no one. Isn’t that what you wanted? You’re not happy. You’ll never be free. You don’t belong anywhere. So be nowhere. Be nothing. Be stardust on the other side. No one will see you. You won’t see you.”

 

Was he right? Was this what I wanted? Sometimes I thought it was... He was right that I wasn’t happy. But Harmony was right too. She was right about everything. I wasn’t happy... but that doesn’t mean I can’t be. I just need to unpack my boxes. I just need help. I just need someone.

 

I conveyed my message. I laid bare my feelings. “No. I don’t want to be no one. I just want to be me.”

 

I concentrated hard. Trying to will myself out of this final nightmare. I focused all of my energy on those feelings and they became a life raft in that vast ocean. I began to see myself again. The real me. And I was so relieved to see her. That is who I am. I belong. I deserve to be me.

 

Gray’s words echoed through the infinite sky. “One way.” This was it. The one way was to live. Live and not just survive.

 

The waves crashed and didn’t want to let me go, but sometimes amidst all of the deep thoughts, it’s the simplest ones that keep you going. I had one more thought, and it was the easiest and most basic of them all: Harmony’s alive. I would really like to meet her.

 

That was the last push. That was all it took. I was back in the basement, at the moment I left. Staring down the burning flesh. He was weak. He had no more tricks. He was dying. I turned my back to him and walked up the stairs.

 

In one final act, to ensure that Fraser Caine would truly be no more, I turned on the gas stoves in the kitchen and sprinted out the door.

 

Gray was there waiting. Harmony sat unconscious in the back seat of his car, Gray’s jacket draped over her shoulders. I briefly flashed him the SSD before making my way to the passenger side.

 

“How is she?” I asked.

 

“Seems alright, just tired... You’re fuckin’ insane, you know that?” He spoke through a pained grimace.

 

“Yeah. Let’s get the hell out of here, this whole place is gonna go in a few seconds.”

 

“Shit.” Gray muttered, quickly climbing into the car as I did the same.

 

We drove off and I could just barely see the glow of an enormous fireball in the rear-view mirror. With it came the biggest and most cathartic sigh of my life. I could breathe for the first time in a long time. Despite all the pain and the deep discomfort, my headache was finally gone.

 

Gray parked on the side of the road a few streets away, letting out a long breath of his own.

 

“It’s fucked up that I’m not gonna be able to tell anyone about this.” Gray remarked.

 

“Oh I don’t know... I think Benji would love it.”

 

Gray chuckled. “Yeah you’re right... Kinda don’t wanna give him the satisfaction.”

 

“Understandable.” I said, knowing full well that I would tell him and probably buy more weed.

 

“Guess I should get us all to a hospital now...” Gray said.

 

I scoffed. “I hate hospitals... Plus, as soon as we get in there it’s gonna be chaos. Questioning, lawyers, all three of us will most likely be arrested. It’s gonna be a nightmare trying to set all this right... Can we just... take a minute?”

 

Gray nodded in agreement. “Okay. Let’s take a minute. What do you wanna do with your minute, Cole?”

 

I thought about it for a couple seconds. “What time does that pizza place close?”

 

“Hah. I knew it. Couldn’t get enough, could ya?” Gray smiled, and began driving.

 

We arrived about ten minutes later. Gray went in to grab our slices, and I sat on the hood of the car, facing the night sky and enjoying the calm breeze.

 

Gray returned with three slices. “Y’know, in case she wakes up.” He explained. “If not, I can eat both.”

 

“How considerate of you, Gray.”

 

“Yeah... You know what, fuck it. Call me Wally.”

 

 “Oh?” I raised my eyebrows and smirked. “I get your fancy nickname?”

 

“Yeah... I just don’t imagine I’ll be getting rid of you anytime soon so, might as well.”

 

“I’m honored.”

 

“You should be. So... Detective Cole... When all this is in the rear-view... What are you gonna do?”

 

I smiled, simply at the notion of this all being over. It was hard to believe. Before I could think of an answer, I heard the car door open and shut behind us.

 

Harmony lethargically made her way towards us, holding her head like she was hungover. Gray wordlessly handed her the slice of pizza, which she accepted without question.

 

“I love this place.” She commented.

 

“No shit. You’ve been?” Gray asked.

 

“Been a few years but yeah... Actually, didn’t you work here?”

 

“Hah. Wally, nice to meet you.” Of course she gets Wally immediately. Gray turned to me. “See? I told you, everybody knows everybody.”

 

Harmony smiled. The first time I had seen her true smile in person, even if it was weighed down by lifetimes worth of trauma. Gray stood up and offered her his spot on the hood, which she accepted.

 

“Just gonna shout at Benji for a sec, I’ll be back.” Gray said, before walking into the building, leaving Harmony and I alone.

 

It was hard to think of what to say to her. So much rushed through my mind. Should I bring up her mother, should I bring up her father? Should I bring up anything at all?

 

“Guess I should say nice to meet you too.” I finally spoke.

 

She smiled again. For that moment it felt like all was right in the world.

 

“Yeah that’s true... Nice to meet you, officially.”

 

We sat in that rare nice moment for a while, but it was burning me up to not say anything more...

 

“I’m sorry... I’m sorry I didn’t get to you sooner. I’m sorry I couldn’t save them.”

 

She shook her head, I could tell she was stifling her emotions to the best of her ability.

 

“No... No... You did so much. I can’t even begin... I’m the one who should...” She stammered as her voice cracked. “It’s just all so fucking....”

 

The tears slowly began to flow and they were almost instantly contagious, but I tried my best to hold strong. I could see her trying and failing to do the same.

 

After a moment she had to give up trying. The dam burst and her silent tears turned to exasperated and pained sobs. I clenched my jaw and placed a hand on her back. In response, she sank into me and wrapped her arms around me tightly. She clung to me for dear life while her tears soaked through my shirt.

 

I couldn’t hold back the tears anymore. Everything washed over me in an instant. A brutal mixture of grief, despair, pain, and relief. My arms instinctively reached out and clung to her in return. This may have been the first time I had cried in front of another human being in my entire adult life, yet I didn’t mind it so much. It was a strange feeling, to find such comfort in the arms of someone I had never met, yet someone I felt as though I had known intimately. No one else would ever know what we went through. Gray, to an extent, but I wouldn’t be caught dead crying in his shoulder.

 

A thought occurred to me and I began to laugh as I felt the tears stream down my face.

 

“How the fuck am I crying without an eye?”

 

Harmony’s cries turned to a snort of laughter. “I know, right? I was surprised too.”

 

“God it feels weird.”

 

“It does. It really does. I’m sorry.”

 

We finally pulled apart, still letting out spurts of exhausted laughter.

 

“Oh god.” She said, wiping my shirt. “I got tears and snot all over your shirt.”

 

“It’s fine, it’s not so bad. Gray... Wally... he got my favorite Bullet Club shirt cut off a few days ago, I haven’t forgiven him.”

 

“Bullet Club?”

 

“It’s not... like that. It’s a thing.” I stammered.

 

“Okay but still, you’re a cop, it kinda sends a message.”

 

“Well I don’t wear it to work! It’s not... It’s just... It’s a cool shirt, from a thing I like.”

 

“Alright, fair enough. Hey, I’m not judging... Sucks that you lost it.”

 

“Nah it’s fine. To be honest, it didn’t actually fit me that well anyway.”

 

Harmony just smiled at me and briefly laid her head on my shoulder. A few very peaceful moments of silence passed, and then Gray exited the store and walked towards us.

 

“I mainly just wanted to go in there so I could bleed all over his floor and make him mop it up. How are you ladies doin’?”

 

“All things considered, could be worse.” I answered. “Should probably hit the road before you bleed to death, old man.”

 

“Yeah I’m beginning to get a little light headed, if we crash I apologize... By the way, you never answered my question, Cole.”

 

“What question was that?”

 

“When this is all over, providing we don’t go to jail for arson and whatnot, what are you gonna do?”

 

I took a second to think about it. Harmony looked at me, eager to hear my response, and it was in her eyes that I found it.

 

“I think I’m gonna go dancing.”
