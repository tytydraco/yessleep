Before I left for school that morning, I tossed the smelly burnt package into our garbage. I’m not sure why I didn’t do it sooner, but I felt better knowing it was getting picked up with our trash that day. I also resolved to talk to my mom and dad. Even if I sounded crazy, I know they’d help me wade through whatever was happening. I almost threw out Rohan’s business card too, but something stopped me. For now, it stayed folded in my back pocket. 

&#x200B;

As I biked home after school I felt better than I had in months. I had a plan. My mom and dad were busy, but good people. I’d tell them what happened, and we’d figure this out. My stomach jumped a bit as I turned on to my street and saw Rick Marshall’s SUV in Mr. B’s driveway. The garage door was open and I knew they’d see me as I passed by to my house. I took a deep breath and kept pedaling. 

&#x200B;

I didn’t get very far. Mr. B practically sprinted down his driveway when he saw me and I stopped reluctantly. One look at his flushed face and the way Mr. Marshall was leaning in the garage told me they’d been drinking. 

&#x200B;

“Dylan! I’m glad I caught you son” He grabbed my shoulder again, but this time in a kind way.

&#x200B;

“Everything OK sir?” I asked, working hard to make myself smaller in his grip.

&#x200B;

“I’m sure you’ve heard about Stu by now,” he began, and continued talking excitedly over my nod, “Well, as you’re aware, I am very close with Sheriff Davidson. Now this is all very hush hush son, you hear? He told me that Stu’s death isn’t being treated as an accidental death. No sir, they have these muddy footprints they found leading away from the pool-” 

&#x200B;

Everything after that faded out. *Muddy footprints?* I felt goosebumps break out up my arm as I thought about the footprints leading from my room to the top of the staircase in my house. 

&#x200B;

“Are you listening boy?” cut in Mr. Marshall, who’d staggered down beside Mr. B and I snapped back to attention. Something was off about both of them, and it wasn’t just the beer. Their eyes had this *intensity* and Mr. Marshall couldn’t seem to sit still. He paced back and forth behind Mr. B.

&#x200B;

“Y-yessir, I’m sorry. I just can’t believe someone would hurt Mr. Corbett” I stammered out, letting all the fear I was feeling into my voice. 

&#x200B;

Mr. B shot Mr. Marshall a look and he backed off. “Now listen son, you’re safe” Mr. B declared, squeezing my shoulder again. “You just need to let me know about anything strange that happens around here. Like that man who came by, he give you anything? Tell you how to get ahold of him?”

&#x200B;

“No sir” I lied, thinking about the card in my pocket. 

&#x200B;

Mr. B stared at me for a moment and said, “Alright son, give me your number, I’ll text you so you have a way to get in touch with me in case anything happens.”

&#x200B;

Wanting to get away, I rattled off my number as quickly as I could. Mr. B typed something into his phone and only let me go when we both heard a message ding. He nodded to me and I wheeled my bike back down to the road, careful not to step on his grass.

&#x200B;

I checked the message as I walked up my driveway. 

&#x200B;

*Remember son, I’m always next door.*

&#x200B;

I put my bike away and walked up to the front door. My heart began to pound. 

&#x200B;

*This isn’t real*. I told myself. But it was. The package was back, with muddy footprints leading down the front steps away from it. 

&#x200B;

I kicked the package out of the way and ran inside, locking the door behind me. 

&#x200B;

I ran into the kitchen calling for my dad, but stopped as I glanced at the calendar. My brain did a million forbidden curses as I remembered mom and dad  were both out of town tonight. Even if I called them to come home right now, they were at least an hour and a half away. 

&#x200B;

My blood froze as a pounding came from the front door. Heart hammering, I slowly walked back down the hallway toward my front door. I jumped as the pounding came again, louder this time. I reached for the door handle and let out a scream as it flew open. 

&#x200B;

My little sister Emma burst in the front door and shot me a look. 

&#x200B;

“Why’d you lock the door, weirdo? I was right behind you. Didn’t you hear me call you?” She chided me as she pushed past into the house. My heart was still pounding in my ears as I sank against the wall. 

&#x200B;

“You scared the shit out of me.” I managed to get out. 

&#x200B;

“You could have brought in Mom’s package.” she replied and I realized with horror that she held the charred package in her hands. “I wonder what happened to it? It looks like they set it on fire.”

&#x200B;

“Super weird, I thought it was a prank or something I guess,” I tried (and failed) to sound normal. “Just leave it in her office so she can find it.” 

&#x200B;

Emma narrowed her eyes at me, but shrugged and headed down the hallway. I ran upstairs to my room, and looked out my window. I could still see Mr. Marshall’s truck in Mr. B’s driveway. I wondered if they had seen someone deliver the package. Maybe that’s why they were acting so weird. 

&#x200B;

I sank onto my bed and muffled a sob. I just wanted to hide in my room and be done with all of this. It seemed like every time I tried to avoid trouble, it just seemed to find me. As I thought about my problems my hand slipped into my pocket and I realized I was holding Rohan’s card again like a talisman. An idea took hold and I opened up my phone. 

&#x200B;

An hour later I was shivering in a nearby park with the package in my backpack. Rohan had agreed to meet me away from my house. It took $20 and a promise of a week’s worth of chores to get Emma to agree to not tell Mom and Dad I went out when I was supposed to be watching her. I made sure she locked up after me and snuck through the backyard to avoid Mr. B and Mr. Marshall out front. 

&#x200B;

For all my precautions, my gut was still rolling as I saw Rohan pull up in a small sedan. He got out and sat next to me on the bench, remarking on what a beautiful day it was. Not willing to make small talk, I pulled the package out of my backpack and sat it on the bench between us. 

&#x200B;

I had thought long and hard about what I was going to say. I had it rehearsed, but when the moment came, it all left my head. All I managed to say woodenly was, 

&#x200B;

“This keeps getting delivered.”

&#x200B;

He paused for a moment. We sat silently on the bench for a moment. When I looked up he was looking at me with kind, sad eyes. All he said softly was “Ah.”

&#x200B;

“D’you think--” I started. Then paused for a moment, not knowing the right words. Rohan waited patiently. 

&#x200B;

“Do you think this has something to do with that delivery driver?” I asked timidly, I felt myself fold in when I saw Rohan’s eyes turn penetrating again.

&#x200B;

“It would seem odd, considering you knew nothing about Rajat.” He responded mildly. I felt my leg start to bounce up and down, and ground into it with my elbow. 

&#x200B;

“Right! No, I mean--” I hated how he stayed silent while I stammered on. I was beginning to regret calling him. I felt my face flush as I stared at the blurring ground in front of me. That familiar voice in my head started up again.  *I’m so pathetic. I just need to go. I can’t help anyway, I’m useless --*

&#x200B;

A hand touched my shoulder and the voice slipped away. The sob I’d been holding on to burst out of my chest and I lost it for a moment on that bench while he waited. 

&#x200B;

“Dylan,” he began gently. “I’m not sure what you’re holding on to, however I promise you the only way that you’ll be able to get rid of the feelings that are plaguing you is to talk about it. Tell me what happened. What happened to Rajat?”

&#x200B;

I sniffled and nodded, trying to catch my breath. I took a breath and prepared myself to tell him everything, when a ding broke my train of thought. 

&#x200B;

“One second sir, this might be my sister” I muttered and pulled my phone out. 

&#x200B;

As I read the message I felt the blood drain from my face.

&#x200B;

“Dylan, what’s wrong?” Rohan sounded alarmed as I swayed on the bench.

&#x200B;

I showed him my phone.

&#x200B;

*Say hi to your friend for us son. Tell him you’re both to meet us at Blackwater Pond within the hour. I’d hate to make us wait any longer with this pretty little thing.*

&#x200B;

Beneath the text was a picture of Emma, trussed up and looking terrified in the back of Mr. B’s truck.
