As I rested my chin on the back porch railing, I could only hope that the kid would return soon. I have grown a liking to them, although it may be more of a concern for their safety. That must be why I am writing this now, so I don't feel crazy.

In my early childhood, me and my brother were walking around at night in the neighborhood. Off to the side, I noticed the figure of a man. I never said anything to anyone, until now, and that may be why he chose me, because he knew I would keep quiet.

I have never been the best with keeping track of time, but I would have to assume that the kid was brought to me around 5 years ago. That man, or whatever he is, was paying me another of his regular nighttime visits. I figured he would just watch me from the tree line, as usual, but he gestured for me to leave my house and come closer. I was always afraid of him, so I obeyed. Being so close to him, I realized how unbelievably tall he was. I mean, I'm on the shorter side but still. I couldn't see his face in the darkness, but he spoke.

"Care for this one while it is not performing tasks for me." As if on command, a small human crawled out from behind him. It wore a large red and white mask. The man continued, "It will not pester you, and it barely eats."

I walked up to the small one, and noticed that it was sitting like a dog, crouched legs with hands on the grounds. It wore a sweater that was two sizes too big for it, and blue athletic shorts. Looking up, I wanted to ask the man a couple questions, but he was gone, as if he just vanished. I bit my lip as I looked to the masked human, unsure of what to do. So, I just said, "C'mon," and it followed me back to my house. It walked on all fours, hands and feet, like those kids you see documentaries about who were raised by wolves or other wild animals. 

When we got inside, I noticed in the light the mask's shape and "mane", and it creepily resembled a possum, so that's what I started calling them. The first thing I did was give them a bath, since they reeked like a skunk tail. I can only guess how long they had been in those woods. Possum took off the mask, and my heart shattered at their face. Half was burned severely, one eye was blinded, and their dark brown hair was a rats' nest. I tried to ignore the misshapen features, but it still hurts me to see the kid and remember their face. Its like, Jesus Christ, what happened to them?

After the bath - which left my arms sore from all the scrubbing - I wanted to test this "barely eats" statement. I heated up some water and made a cup of instant noodles. Possum, still on all fours, watched me intently the entire time. I moved the noodles from the narrow cup to a large bowl, and placed it in front of him on the floor with a fork. He sniffed it a few times, then, as expected, went to town on the noodles with his bare hands. This made me feel even more sad for him. What was strange was how he gobbled up the noodles so fast, drank every drop of soup, then looked at me like he wanted more. This kid obviously didn't just not eat, he was starved. 

On a lighter note, Possum has a very creative mind. Other than baths and eating, he spends his time while at my house making masks out of paper and carboard boxes. I got him hooked on poster board, since it was a good mix of the previous two. What pains me is, even though he does all these crafty things, he doesn't understand speech very much. He'll cock his head at me when I ask him questions or say something. The main words I know he understands are food, house, and Possum, his name. 

If I can, I will try to keep updates on him when he returns. It will help me since my memory isn't the best, anyway. Thank you to anyone who reads this.
