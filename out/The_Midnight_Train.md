I never believed in those urban legends—stories about cursed objects, haunted houses, or sinister creatures lurking in the dark. They were just tales to scare little kids. But that was before the midnight train started showing up in my town.

It all began last fall. Our town is small, barely a blip on the map, and the nearest train station is miles away. So, when people started hearing a train whistle in the dead of night, it didn’t make any sense. The first time I heard it, I thought I was dreaming. But then, others started talking about it too. 

They said the train would only come at exactly 12:13 a.m. If you were awake and close to the tracks, you’d hear it—a low, mournful whistle echoing through the trees. But here’s the thing: there were no tracks. Not anymore. The old rail lines had been ripped up decades ago, replaced by a forgotten path swallowed by the forest.

One night, curiosity got the best of me. I stayed up late, staring at the clock as it ticked closer to midnight. 12:10... 12:11... 12:12... Then, right on cue, I heard it. The whistle.

I crept out of the house, pulling my jacket tight against the chill. The moon was hidden behind thick clouds, and the air was still, almost suffocating. I headed toward the old rail path, now just a dirt trail cutting through the woods. The whistle grew louder, more insistent. My heart raced with each step, a mix of fear and excitement.

When I reached the clearing where the tracks used to be, I stopped in my tracks. There it was—a massive, black steam locomotive, sitting on tracks that shouldn’t exist. The engine was old, covered in rust and grime, but the lights were on, casting an eerie glow over the clearing. I could see the train cars stretching back into the darkness, too many to count.

The train whistle blew again, and I swear it sounded like a scream. The door to one of the cars slid open with a groan, and I felt this strange pull, like the train was calling to me, begging me to step inside.

My phone buzzed in my pocket, startling me. I pulled it out and saw a message from my friend Maya.

**Maya**: Dude, you up? I heard the train again. Did you go outside?

**Me**: Yeah, I’m at the old rail path. The train’s here, Maya. It’s real.

**Maya**: Get out of there. Now. My grandma told me about that train. It’s dangerous. It takes people.

**Me**: What do you mean, ‘takes people’?

But before she could reply, the phone slipped from my hand, landing in the dirt. I bent down to grab it, but when I looked up, I froze.

There were faces in the windows of the train cars. Pale, lifeless faces, staring at me with hollow eyes. Their mouths moved, but no sound came out, like they were trapped behind a thick pane of glass. My blood ran cold. 

One of the figures in the window pressed its hand against the glass. Its skin was translucent, and I could see the dark veins running through it. The figure’s eyes locked onto mine, pleading, as if begging for help. But then the train started to move, slowly at first, the wheels grinding against the tracks with a screech that made my ears ring.

I wanted to run, to get as far away as possible, but my feet wouldn’t move. The train kept picking up speed, and the figures in the windows started to fade, melting into the darkness inside the cars. The whistle blew again, louder this time, more desperate. 

I finally forced myself to move, grabbing my phone and sprinting back down the trail. I didn’t stop until I was back at my house, slamming the door behind me, my breath coming in ragged gasps.

My phone buzzed again.

**Maya**: Are you okay? Please tell me you got away.

**Me**: I’m home. But something’s wrong. The people on the train… They looked like they were trapped. They wanted out.

**Maya**: My grandma said the train takes people. But they don’t just disappear. They become part of it. Their souls get trapped, and they’re stuck on that train forever. Don’t go near it again.

I wanted to believe she was just messing with me, but deep down, I knew she was telling the truth. The next morning, I tried to find the trail again, to see if the train had left any tracks behind, but the path was gone. It was like it had never existed.

The nights after that, I tried to ignore the whistle, but I could still hear it. It was softer now, but more insistent, like it was calling me back. And I knew that if I went back to that spot, the train would be waiting for me, ready to take me away.

Sometimes, I wonder about those people I saw in the windows. Who were they? What happened to them? And if I hadn’t run, would I be one of them now? I still hear the whistle every night at 12:13 a.m., but I don’t go outside anymore. Because I know that once you board the midnight train, there’s no coming back.
