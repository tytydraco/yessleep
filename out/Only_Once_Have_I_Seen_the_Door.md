Hey everyone. My name’s Jack. I’ve decided to write all this here. Maybe it’ll help me make sense of it all and keep a solid track on my chronology of things. Maybe someone out there has felt something similar. I doubt it, but hey, the internet can be a strange place.

First, some background. I’m not a crazy person. At least, I’d like to hope I’m not. I’m a pretty normal guy. I’m going to college. I have a part time job at a fast-food place, I’ve got ex-girlfriends, I drive a ford focus, blah blah blah. But, my whole life, I’ve had these moments. They’re hard to describe, so I’ll pose you this analogy to give you the right foundation.

I have a lot of these vague glimpses of memories, from when I was a very young child, of my own parents socialising, having a drink with friends, hosting events, whatever, where I’d wander downstairs to get a snack or something and I’d feel a little bit caught off guard for a moment by the sight of strangers in my house that my parents seemed to be getting on fine with. My parents would try to introduce me to their friend or cousin that I didn’t recognise, but I’d forget about whoever they were shortly after. I feel like a lot of people have early childhood memories like that, because when we were very young children, our parents were naturally younger too and were spending more time keeping up with friends and whatnot.

Sometimes, I’ll get a glimpse of something like a wine glass or a lit candle on a table and feel myself floating away, back into vague flashes and feelings of a dinner party my parents had one night with the in-laws or something like that. And that’s what I’m getting at: random feelings of recognition in your surroundings that give you hard to pin down senses of familiarity, leading you back to half-formed memories. But the way I experience it is a bit different. It’s not Déjà vu. It’s more like a stutter. A momentary glitch in my own perception. I like to call it static.

It usually happens when I’m run-down, sleep-deprived, or after smoking too much weed too quick. Like, for example, I’ll be lying in bed hungover, listening to the low hum of my desk fan, and for a split second, the hum will resolve. It’ll sound like a distant crowd of people cheering excitedly about something, or a woman singing a song in a different language. The weirdest part, then, is the feeling that follows. The absolute, bone-deep realisation that I’ve been listening to those noises for the last five minutes, I just hadn’t realised it yet. It’s like a retroactive certainty. My conscious mind is always the last to know.

I’ve felt this “static” with sights, too. Like, a particular shade of peeling yellow paint on a bus stop that I gazed at for a few minutes before suddenly feeling sure I’d seen it on the wall of a hospital room somewhere I’d been in once when I was a kid. The feeling is never, “Hey, that looks familiar.” It’s “There it is again. It’s been here the whole time.”

I’ve always written it off. A trick of a tired brain. My synapses misfiring. It’s always been so easy to disregard, because it was so rare. That was before everything that’s happened.

How it starts is I’d already been feeling hungover and out of it from the house party I’d been at the previous day. It was 2 pm by the time I was up from the couch. I started my day, just like Anthony and the others waking up at his flat, with a breakfast of leftover Chinese poorly re-heated in the microwave, a glass of Dr. Pepper from the bottle we’d been using last night for mixers, and a few bong rips. So, by the time we’d gotten ourselves sufficiently baked, it was 4 pm and I was walking to the bus stop with our group. Anthony’s flat is in an estate about a twenty-minute walk down some barren roads and suburbs away from the town where me and him grew up. We were walking with some of the other guys and gals from the party with the intention of getting a bus back over to where our community college is, an hour or so away, where most of us were living in student accommodation. But somewhere along the way, in the scorching heat of the day and our hazy state, we took a wrong turn. Even Anthony wasn’t sure exactly where we were. We had a loose idea, since we were still near the huge woods of the state park that enclosed around much of the area between Anthony’s estate and our hometown. As we kept walking and chatting aimlessly, we eventually stumbled upon a strange pub, a sort of half-bar, half-arcade that was set up across from an empty, dusty yard or lot. There were only a few run-down bungalows nearby.

We stared at the odd pub. I felt sure it was just a lame dive bar with a few arcade machines shoved in the corners to get 80’s nostalgic types all horny and drain them with shitty bar prices, but we were so bored and stoned that we saw the possibility of arcade games and freshly poured beers and thought, “Sure, why not.”

While everyone spent the following hours throwing back drinks in our elegantly dishevelled state in that crummy place, a strange sense of premonition in my mind, and Anthony’s too, I think, seemed to have sprouted. A strange feeling of growing dread, a sense of anticipation for some huge revelation. That feeling kept growing, something completely unknown and yet undeniable, as time passed into evening and then nightfall, as I continued drinking, trying to make conversation with people, chatting with girls I liked the look of, normal bar stuff. I remember there was this fat, nasty spider in one of the corners of the ceiling. It hadn’t made a web, it was just slowly skulking about in circles. I couldn’t take my eyes off it.

Now, my buddy Anthony is what you’d call an experienced tripper. He believes in expanding the mind, so to speak. I was always the cautious one. Anthony tapped on my shoulder late into the night and took me outside, where he showed me the tabs of acid he’d been talking about. I remember feeling that the moment was important. I mean that moment, standing outside that strange pub at night, staring across the road at that dusty yard and, behind it, the woods – I knew that I would remember that moment for the rest of my life. Even though nothing that special was really even going on. I knew I’d remember Anthony’s Marietta t-shirt. I’d remember the pile of tires scattered in the yard. I’d remember the rusty storm drain a few feet from where we stood at the pub’s entrance. We decided my first acid trip should be somewhere peaceful, in nature, so we picked one of the winding country roads around and through the state park woods, and started walking. Then we partook.

The come-up was fine. A little giddiness, the trees looking a bit more vibrant. Then I hit the peak. The world started to breathe. The asphalt of the road pulsed like a vein. Anthony was walking beside me, talking about the lifecycle of moss or something, his voice a steady, grounding presence. But then, a second voice started up.

It was also Anthony’s voice. But it wasn’t coming from beside me. It was inside my head, clear as day, as though he were sitting in an empty room right behind my eyes. He was commenting on my thoughts, narrating my panic.

“He’s thinking about the fan now,” the internal Anthony-voice said as I looked in utter disorientation at the real Anthony, calm and conversational. “He’s wondering if it’s all connected.”

 I stared at the real Anthony. His mouth was moving, talking about how the universe is all connected and that means busting a nut and getting a girl pregnant is basically the same as planting a tree sapling. The voice of Anthony in my head, however, was speaking directly to me.

“Dude, you okay?” the real Anthony asked. “You’re looking a little pale.”

That’s when I saw a third man off in the distance. About fifty feet ahead, standing off the path under the canopy of an ancient oak tree, was a man. He was tall, gaunt, looked to be in his forties, wearing a brown suit that looked decades out of date. He was just standing there, staring at the bark of the tree, running his fingers over it like he was reading Braille. There was something about his facial features, the exact movements of his hands. At first, it was just a vague sense of familiarity, and then I felt a spark within me. I felt those same feelings of static I’ve described throughout my life.

Something about a kid I’d known briefly in the early days of my childhood… his name was Douglas, I’m pretty sure. A third cousin, I think, or maybe a family friend’s son? Or was he some imaginary friend I had? No, he was definitely real, and he was in the family, but he wasn’t a close relative. I saw him maybe twice in my life. My one solid memory of him is from a family gathering when I was six. All the other kids were playing tag, but I found Douglas, who was a few years older than me, sitting alone by the creek. He was meticulously stacking these smooth, grey stones into a perfect, freestanding archway of sorts. Like a little depiction of a skyscraper jutting up from the ground. It was impossibly delicate. When he saw me watching, he didn’t smile. I thought it was cool and impressive, I remember, so I asked him how he’d made it. He just looked at me with these ancient, tired eyes and said, “It’s a door. But you mustn’t open it.” Then, he kicked it over and walked away.

The man standing underneath that tree was a grown-up version of Douglas. There was no doubt in my mind. I don’t know how I knew; I just knew it.

“Anthony, I slurred, my tongue feeling thick. “Do you see that guy? Under the tree?”

Anthony squinted. “What guy, man? There’s no one there. Hey, dude, constellations. They’re weird. It’s like they’re people in the sky. Or in the things between.”

I didn’t understand what Anthony meant. It felt all wrong. I saw movement in the distance. The man – Douglas – turned his head slowly and looked directly at me. His face was a mask of sorrow so deep it felt geological. Like he wasn’t really a brain behind it all, just pure misery.

*“This isn’t possible,”* I thought, my mind reeling. I realised how little this made sense, even if I was tripping. This couldn’t be Douglas. Douglas had only been a few years older than me as a kid. So this fortyish looking guy obviously can’t be him. And something else. My mom had told me about it years later. This memory took even longer to dredge up. It was the thought of constellations that brough it back to me. I don’t even know where the connection is in that. Douglas had had some mental break at some point, my Mom told me once years ago. He’s been in an institution since he was a teenager. He couldn’t even ne here right now, on top of him not being the right age. So why was my brain constructing all of this?

As I continued locking eyes with the stranger, as Anthony stared off into space beside me, the internal Anthony-voice answered that last question the second it’d occurred to me. “He’s the devil.”

The real Anthony was now looking across at me, concerned, asking if I needed to sit down. But in that moment, I knew two things for sure. The voice in my head was absolutely not my friend. And that man under the tree, whether he was Douglas or the devil or both or neither, was certainly real in a way that Anthony, the road, and the trees suddenly didn’t feel like they were. The filter wasn’t just down, it’d been torn off somehow, and I felt I could finally see the static that was there all along, even if I didn’t understand what that really meant.

Anthony decided to call things off then, and we went and got a motel to wait out the rest of the trip, Part of me wanted to forget about everything, to pretend it just never happened or that, like Anthony said, I’d just gotten unlucky and had an awful first trip. But the other part, the part that’s been listening to the hum of the static my whole life, knew that wasn’t an option. The door was open, and I couldn’t just close my eyes on what was inside.

Coming down from the trip was like being thrown back into a world made of cardboard after seeing the real scaffolding and foundations underneath. Everything felt thin and fake. Anthony drove me home, freaked out. He was saying, “Dude you were just having a bad trip. Even though it sucks that it was your first time, it happens.” But he wouldn’t look me in the eye.

The problem is, it didn’t stop when the acid wore off. The filter was gone. Permanently. Now, the static was everywhere.

The first time it happened, I was making some coffee for myself. I was listening to the background noise of the *drip-drip-drip* of the coffee machine while going to the fridge for the milk. I realised the sound had, somewhere in the background, suddenly sounded unmistakably like the unintelligible voice of someone from long ago in my past. Some girl, I think, some girl called Molly from my elementary school that I hadn’t really been friends with and could barely even remember at first.

I could suddenly make out what her voice was saying as it coalesced into three clear and whispered words before it vanished from my mind right as I’d realised it. And even today I can’t remember the tone of voice or punctuation as she spoke them, just the words themselves.

*Ask your grandpa*

I stood there, frozen, the carton of milk feeling somehow warm in my hand. This could’ve been nothing. It could’ve been exactly like before, just a random intense recognition, just like the moments of static I’d gotten in the past. “Ask your grandpa,” is a perfectly normal phrase in and of itself, after all. And it’s the kind of thing I might have a vague, mostly forgotten memory of someone almost completely irrelevant to my life saying once. And yet I felt sure that it wasn’t just a memory. I felt sure it meant something. That it was an instruction. I felt I had no real choice to make.

So I went to visit my grandfather. Me and Grandpa Francis have a good relationship. He’s seventy, but his mind is still mostly sharp, no signs of decline. He just gets a little wistful sometimes is all. I meet up with him at his house every few months to have a glass of something and a chat. He lives in a quiet, detached house about an hour away that smells of old books and liniment.

I gave him a call and said I was passing through his neck of the woods and was wondering if he wanted to catch up for a bit. He was more than welcome to it. When I arrived, he ushered me inside as always with a firm handshake. I didn’t know how to bring it all up. I just tried to stay engaged with Grandpa’s initial small talk and questions as he poured us each a glass of Captain Morgan’s spiced gold, before trying to subtly pivot and steer the conversation over. I did the only thing I could think of and asked him casually enough if he had any interesting or weird stories from when he was younger. Grandpa Francis is full of stories, and swapping them is something we’d often do. He got a suddenly distant look in his eyes.

“Well,” he said, and I could almost hear it in his relatively steady voice. Underneath the lazy composure, the sound of the cogs in his head gradually kicking into action.

“There was my old friend Petey. This was back around when we were no older than you are now. Just two guys with everywhere to be and nowhere to go. The two of us, working in the old autoshop all day long. Boy, you remember how it was, amount of times you’ve seen that dump over the years. But I was always happy with how things were. Quiet, you know. No fuss. That’s the life I wanted. But Petey thought there had to be more to the world. More to see, more to feel, more to experience. Always more with that fella. God, Jack, you remember all the stories I’ve told about the road trips, and the hiking, and the folks we’d meet at bars… wouldn’ta happened without Petey. He rattled my nerves to no end but I woulda lived a less full youth without him, no doubt.”

I leaned in. Grandpa had talked about his old friend Petey before. I felt this was going somewhere, but I played it cool. Grandpa took a sip and continued.

“Petey would go exploring when he was free. Exploring the roads, the abandoned houses, everywhere. ‘Specially the woods, the big state park, not far from where that friend of yours lives, actually.” At that, I had to supress a chill.

“Petey was stupid. You hear me? Stupid kid. Always poking his nose where it didn’t belong, hoping he’d find something new. And eventually, he found something alright. Something strange. He took me into the woods one summer day, wanting to show me.

“It was a door,” Grandpa said after a pause. “Just a door, made of old, dark wood, standing all by itself in a clearing. No house, no was. Just this door. It was in good nick, fresh paint job on there, and the bottom of the doorframe was nailed securely into the topsoil of the ground, so it stood perfectly upright, just like a normal door. Petey, he was always the brave one, he walked right up to it.”

Grandpa paused again, taking a longer sip. The house was silent except for the ticking of the clock. I realised I’d stopped breathing.

“What does that make Petey?” Grandpa asked.

“Stupid,” I answered, trying to force a jokey voice.

“He gets closer and closer to the doorframe, and I’m thinking it’s a bad idea. I’m thinking he’s putting himself in danger. But, I mean, why would I even have thought that? It’s just a door. But it felt all kinds of wrong. Petey’s almost able to reach out and touch the door when it opens up. A man stepped out. Or, well, I suppose he was always standing in that clearing in the woods, behind the door. You wouldn’t call it stepping out of the door so much as walking through it. No way to know which way’s in and which way’s out, right?

“He was dressed in normal enough clothes, but there was something wrong with his eyes. Petey told me later it was like looking into a well that had no bottom. He looked at us, and he had this expression of anguish on his face so profound it was almost alien. And then, his voice, it… it sounded exactly like the voice of someone I could remember, but I don’t know who. There was something about it that had been changed, something made poisonous. The whole clearing smelled like an electrical fire. “It’s worse inside,” he said. Petey fell back and grasped my arm and whispered to me like he just knew it, “He’s all bad.” And he was. We ran all the way home and never spoke of it again,” Grandpa finished. “I knew that day that the Lord works in strange ways, but I wonder sometimes, does the devil work in stranger.” He made the sign of the cross in an unfocused way as he gazed out the window. We both drained our glasses.

I tried to keep myself in check while Grandpa and I carried on having a generally fine chat for the next ten minutes or so. I could tell it was time to leave. Grandpa was more zoned out now than before. We said our goodbyes. I knew why it was. He was brooding. I’d heard about Petey in a good few of Grandpa’s old stories from back in his day. If I was remembering correctly, Petey Jackson had died less than a year after that story Grandpa just told me, when he was around twenty. 1976. The exact details of his death are the only part that Grandpa himself had never actually told me. He’d never needed to. I’d heard it all before, because Petey’s death is still a mystery. I couldn’t help but think about it as I drove home.

Petey vanished one day. After a day’s work at the autoshop, him and Grandpa parted ways as always, but Petey’s family never saw him come home. Only a few hours later, Petey was found naked and dead in a ditch by some teenagers who were out camping a whole state away. Petey didn’t even have a car of his own. Nobody had any idea how he could’ve gotten there on his own.

I only knew about this part from Grandpa Francis, but a few weeks after that, a bartender in our hometown opened up for the day and set about to work one morning as usual before he noticed, in the dusty, barren yard across the road, there was a small, slightly damaged and pitiful looking fridge standing by itself. He'd no idea who dumped it but wanted to get rid of it, since he thought it was an eyesore. He dropped it on his first attempt, and the door snapped open, spilling its contents. Stuffed inside that fridge had been some of Petey’s clothes, neatly folded and pristine. There were that clothes that didn’t belong to him at all in there too. A deck of magic the gathering cards, Petey’s baseball bat, and the shed skin of some kind of tarantula. Grandpa told me the bartender just left the fridge in the yard after that. Didn’t want to go anywhere near it. Grandpa called the police himself when he heard about the clothes and baseball bat, but nothing ever came of it. Petey’s death was never solved, and they never found out why his things turned up after the fact in that manner.

When I got home, the investigation began. I’m in the process of working through my sociology thesis for my sophomore year of college. I’m used to research. I started digging into local records, old newspaper archives. I wasn’t looking for shit about “the devil” or “strange doors in the woods”. I was looking for patterns. And believe me, I found them. It took many, many hours of digging, but eventually I stumbled upon them.

The first was an article from 2016 about a boy a few counties away from my area named Douglas Pickman, who, not long after his sixteenth birthday, was committed to a mental institution after being found wandering in that same state park. I’d heard bits and pieces of the story before, though I was shaky on the details, trying to pull at threads I could mostly remember from overheard conversations as a child.

Douglas had seemed disoriented and strange for weeks beforehand, according to his parents. They said he’d been refusing to eat anything that had colour. It was rice, bread, mashed potato and milk every breakfast, lunch and dinner. He’d sneak out constantly at night, but there were no signs that he was meeting girls, partying, doing drugs, anything. His grades remained fine, near-perfect, actually.

He'd sneak outside and just stand outside his first-floor bedroom window, staring out into the night. Why even bother going outside? By day, when he thought nobody was looking, they’d sometimes see him out on the road leading out from the house, stooping over, staring down into a particular storm drain. They’d heard once from a postman that he’d been whispering things down into the drain. One thing the postman could remember hearing was “I remember I was killing you but it’s all different inside”. Douglas’ friends at school said he’d kept trying to give away his things to them, saying he’d just be throwing them away otherwise. Things they knew he was proud of, like his signed band t-shirts and magic the gathering cards.

Once, his dad had heard him skulking about at night and went to investigate. He couldn’t find him in his bedroom or anywhere in the house for that matter. Staring out the window into the night – a terribly stormy one – lightning flashed for a few seconds. In the blue, white-hot light, illuminating momentarily the fields across from their house, he saw Douglas, a hundred feet away, running around carefree, going in and out from behind the many haybales scattered about. When the man got out to his son, he found him lying unconscious on the golden soil. He was wearing different clothes, somehow. Both his parents said they’d never bought or seen them before. They were old school, like 70’s high school style. There was a dead cat on the ground next to him.

One day he snuck out and never came back. There was a search, and a day later the police found him in those woods of the state park, having climbed up a tree and refusing to come down, claiming he’d “found where it sounds right.” He was violently thrashing a long, rusty nail at any of the officers who tried to pull him down. He was only collected after he’d started bashing his forehead against a thick, jutting stump in the tree branch and dented his skull, falling down onto the ground about ten feet below. He was apparently very lucky to survive and had done permanent damage to his skull.

I suddenly remembered something else as I read – something my mother had mentioned to me years ago when she told me about all of this. The memory was still foggy, but I remembered her telling me something Officer Dell had said to her once. He’s married to a friend of my mom’s, Caroline Dell, so they know each other well enough. According to him, as Douglas fell from the tree, and after he landed before passing out from shock and blunt force trauma, he kept screeching incoherently. “Screeches like a fax machine”, Dell had said. I’ve got no idea what that could mean but it didn’t sound good. And one thing, intelligible in the screeching, over and over. “Where’s the boy?”

Dell said he seemed to be staring right at him, and his eyes were like “every pair of eyes he’d ever looked into but different.” And as he stared down at the boy being cuffed, he was startled when the air suddenly reeked of something like an electrical fire. All the other officers denied that detail when he mentioned it afterwards. A few months later, Caroline miscarried their child. As the doctors broke that information to them, Dell said he remembered that exact smell again, seeping into every crack of the maternity ward. He's never smelled it again, apparently. They never did end up trying again for a child.

I’d no idea what to make of all this. It was all just strange things I could half-remember hearing about before, suddenly being spurred forward. But I felt sure it meant something, and it was plaguing me. I felt if I could get to the bottom of it all I might understand everything else that’d been happening to me, both as of late and throughout my life. The end of the article mentioned Douglas’ family’s – *my family’s –* long history of “nervous mental conditions”. I’d never heard anything about this before in my life.

I dug deeper. Census records, obituaries, police blotters. A great-uncle of mine I wasn’t aware of who’d vanished on a hunting trip in 1952. A daughter of a *great*\-grand-uncle who apparently died in a “domestic accident” after neighbours reported her screaming about a man in the attic. It’s all the same. An unnavigable breadcrumb trail of mental breakdowns and inexplicable tragedies, all leading seemingly to nothing, and yet it all felt connected somehow.

It's hard to explain how cagey I was at this time. It was getting more and more invasive to my daily life, too. Like, one time I was walking to my house from the college library where I’d been doing my research, when I saw that there was a dude walking up the street against me. Seemed like another college guy from the backpack and the direction he was headed, towards campus. Way off into the distance – this particular street is long and straight – he’s walking up towards me. As we kept approaching one another, he came more into vision and the guy’s face was now less hazy from the distance, He was starting to look exactly like a guy called Ritchie who’d been in my year back in high school. I hadn’t really been super close friends with him and I never saw much of him after starting college, since he hadn’t had any interest in it and went straight to working at his dad’s autoshop.

That made this kind of strange. Since Ritchie never went to college to my knowledge, why’d he seem to be going to campus with a backpack? But that was crazy talk. Ritchie – I was certain now it was him – could be going anywhere in this direction, with a backpack, for any reason, right? It’s none of my business. And yet I felt sure there was something to this, something that meant something.

And then it got stranger, in a way. As Ritchie and I came even closer to each other, crossing paths at last, I realised I had been wrong, this guy didn’t actually look anything like Ritchie as I remembered him at all. As we fully intersected and crossed paths, I was left wondering what I’d just experienced. Whether this man was or wasn’t Ritchie, what was it about him that’d led my mind to conjuring all that up? He hadn’t actually done anything. As I thought about it, I couldn’t even remember exactly what Ritchie actually did look like. And, come to think of it, where was Ritchie? Did he even work at an autoshop at all? The only one around for miles is the one in my hometown, near Grandpas’ house, that he and Petey worked at.

This type of strangeness of thought and paranoia had been pervading my life ever since the experience during the acid trip. Little things like this kept cropping up throughout my day to day life, making me momentarily question my sense of self, and as it piled up it all felt both more and more disjointed and ontologically incompatible, and more and more like it was all connected, I just couldn’t work out why or how. It was like there was something truly, utterly terrible hiding somewhere just out of frame in the metaphorical TV screen that I was viewing my memories through.

And maybe the more I’d began to remember, defences had been put in place and all these ominous, contradictory threads had been thrown at me. Maybe I was simply not supposed to remembered. I wondered if maybe my salvation was buried deep in my memories, too – what if all I had to do was keep trying to trigger more and more memories, because if I could just remember enough about something, I could get to the bottom of it all and expose whoever was behind it? But then, what would that something even be? And something else had been growing, a feeling that it was all going to be coming to a head soon somehow.

Anthony found me at the campus library. He looked scared. “Jack, you have to stop this shit, bro,” he said, lowering his voice. He sounded the least stoned I’d heard him in a while. “I looked a bit into your family. This whole thing doesn’t feel like, just, a joke, or a weird hallucination or whatever. Everyone like you who’s gone down this thing, they’re gone. They’ve either disappeared or they… they killed themselves. You’re chasing some kind of ghost story that’s still making more.”

I heard his words. I really did. But as he was speaking, the other voice of Anthony, the one from before, the internal one, was smoother, clearer. It didn’t even sound much like Anthony anymore, it was just a calm, neutral tone, but I knew it was the same voice.

*“He is a guardian,”* it said, the voice full of hate and causing flashes in my mind of teeth, of hair, of darkness, spiders, asphalt. *“He keeps the lambs from the pasture.”*

I didn’t tell Anthony what I heard this time. I thanked him for his concern and told him I thought I was getting over it all anyway. Inside my mind, however, the size of the rift that I’d instantaneously felt open up between us was like suddenly getting dropped into the Grand Canyon. I didn’t know what to think about anything anymore.

The signals were changing. They weren’t just commentary anymore. They’re, they’re *navigational*. Like, yesterday, I was stoned and watching a nature documentary. I hadn’t been to any of my classes or my job for a while. I was trying to put myself into a foggy headspace deliberately now, trying to elicit more and more of the static in my subconscious, hoping it might trigger memories that could reveal more clues to me. I’d been denying myself sleep, deliberately zoning out to music or the TV, getting high non-stop, I’d even been experimenting with binaural beats. As I was zoning out, high, reading some texts on my phone and absorbing the background noise of National Geographic, a generally quiet and easy cacophony had filled the room. Until the sounds from the documentary of flowing water, of rustling leaves, of chirping birds, all tightened, sharpened, and became that same hate-filled voice, like friction on a carpet.

*The map the third drawer the green circle*

I walked over to my desk, my body moving almost on its own. I pulled out the topographical map of the state park I’d picked up at their gift shop while I was driving home from Grandpa’s and all but forgotten about in the drawer. It was tucked into the third drawer. In the deep woodland, where Grandpa’s story had taken place, someone had drawn a small, precise circle in green ink. I don’t even own a green pen. I knew what was in that circle. I didn’t need to check the coordinates against my memories of the acid trip. I just knew. It was all coming together now, I felt. I was going to the woods.

That brings us to the reason for my post, folks. I’m not looking for answers anymore. I’m just leaving a record. A warning, maybe, for anyone else who hears the signal. Stop reading now, if you’re smart. Go back to your life. Consider the static nothing but.

I went back to the woods. The green circle on the map was a pull I could never resist. The journey wasn’t like the first time with Anthony. There was no laughter, no intoxication, no adventurous feelings. This was like a funeral march. I told no one I was going. The woods were silent in a way that felt intentional, like the birds and the insects were holding their breath. I didn’t need the map at all. My own blood seemed to know the way, pulling me forward like a diving rod tuned to a lucid nightmare. The air grew colder, felt denser. The familiar panicky stutter in my perception I’ve experienced throughout my life was no longer a glitch, here. It was the dominant signal. And then, amongst all the thin birch trees and cracked beams of sunlight dispersing through the canopy overhead, I saw the door.

It was exactly as Grandpa Francis had described. A simple, freestanding doorframe of dark, weathered wood; no walls or house to be seen. It was just there. It was both the most utterly mundane and the most wrong thing I’ve ever witnessed. The sight of it radiated waves of something bad, just pure bad. There was something inherent to the doorframe, something hidden beneath the atoms in the different materials and components that made up its structure, something lurking within that sent my nervous system into a state or revolt. Something about the doorframe and its presence here violated reality simply by existing.

As I stood there, maybe ten feet away, the final broadcast from the signal came through. It wasn’t even a voice this time, more like a knowing, a sudden injection of utter truth. A data packet that an unknown force had suddenly downloaded directly into my soul for me. I understood. The door changed me. It changes us. It breaks our filters. When I saw who I felt, impossibly, was Douglas, I think the voice in my head of Anthony was telling the truth. In a way, I think it was. I must have seen the devil. I saw him, who had walked through the doorway and been change. He was perceiving everything like how I felt I could suddenly perceive everything. The weight of time, the memories trapped in the soil, the silent anguish of every living thing for miles. That must’ve been why it called him the devil, I thought desperately. It was the only word big enough to hold the terror.

The signal, the static, everything, I think it’s what’s on the other side of that filter. It’s the raw data of existence. Beautiful. Entrancing. Labyrinthine. Terrible. Unbearable. Stepping through the door would be to understand everything. To become a clear channel. I would know why Douglas built his stone archways. I would know the name of the woman singing in my fan. I would know what the rocks remember. I would also cease to be Jack. I would be a vessel, overflowing, forever drowning in an ocean, a psychic avalanche of disjointed truths. I stood at the threshold for a long time. I felt the pull.

The part of me that has always been curious, that has always listened, wanted nothing more than to step forward and finally, finally know. I thought of Anthony’s face then, full of fear. I thought of dead spiders curling up in on themselves. I thought of rusty nails and electrical heat and gnashing teeth and I thought of darkness, and I thought of life. I felt nauseous beyond belief and fell for a second to my knees. I thought of my grandfather, who lived a long, pleasant and normal life apart from one very strange day in the woods, because he’d ran away from this very clearing in them. I thought of the simple pleasure of a family gathering. Of getting high and goofing off with a friend. Of playing sports. Of brewing coffee in the morning. Of having a beer and awkwardly making small talk or catching up with someone.

I made my choice. I turned my back on the door. I didn’t run, I walked. One foot in front of the other, away from the clearing, away from the silence, back towards the world of cardboard and whispers.

I am home now. The world is quiet. The signal is gone.

That’s the lie I have to tell myself to get through the day. The truth is, the signal isn’t gone, I don’t think. I think I’ve done something permanent to my ability to receive it, whatever it really is. I had to. To survive. It’s like I’ve taken a weed-whacker to my own mind with a psychological scorched-tar policy. I’ve severed the connection and I’ve scarred the landscape.

The world feels grey. Flat. The colours are muted. Music doesn’t really feel like music anymore, more like an arrangement of notes and beats in an order that’s sonically pleasing to the human brain for whatever evolutionary reason. A joke is just a sequence of information drip-fed to build towards a reveal and punchline. I still laugh, but more in an “oh, that’s clever” kind of way. The deep, intuitive part of me that sometimes just felt sure of certain things is now silent. It’s a numbness that I think I will carry for the rest of my life.

I saw Anthony yesterday. We had a beer. It was a slight bit awkward and stilted. He says I seem better. More grounded. I agreed and it was almost like old times between the two of us, but he doesn’t understand, will likely never understand, that I had to cripple a part of myself forever to achieve this peace.

I am safe. I am sane. I am empty.

The door is still there in the woods too, of course. And sometimes, in the dead of the night, when the silence is absolute, I can feel the ghost of the static’s hum. A phantom limb of the soul. And I am filled with the most profound anguish and regret, so profound it feels almost alien, not for what I found but for what I had to destroy in myself to get away from it.

Don’t look for the door. If you hear the static’s hum, learn to live with it. The only thing worse than hearing that signal is the silence you have to create to make it stop.
