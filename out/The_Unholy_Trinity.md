I grew up in a small town in the Bible Belt of the deep south. My mom was a devout baptist and was very strict when I was a kid. We were only allowed outside to go to church and even then we were forced to wear hoods and told not to look at or speak to anyone. We weren’t allowed to celebrate Halloween and we were sent to bed without dinner if we couldn’t recite the days bible verse perfectly.

I never knew my father and I imagine even Batman couldn’t get much out of my mother if he tried. Any questions about him would be answered with a wooden paddle. I didn’t know his name, what he looked like or even where he came from and that was that. I was just another child of a coward who wasn’t man enough to stick around and deal with the consequences of his actions. Or so I thought. 

November 2nd 2022 was the day everything changed. My 18th birthday. I woke up that day a man but staring back at me from the mirror was the same soul crushed, brainwashed boy who went to bed hungry the night before. I moped down the stairs and dragged my feet to the table for breakfast. I was greeted with the tired, scared faces of my siblings and the stern, concentrated frown of my mother but not a single “happy birthday.” 

We didn’t celebrate birthdays. My mom believed the act of congratulating yourself on being born was blasphemy because it was Jesus’ achievement, not ours. But as I 
Battled my way through my cold, burnt breakfast, I realised something. I was an adult now. I could do whatever I wanted short of drinking (I stand by the belief that that is a stupid law). I decided I was finally going to confront my mom about all the secrets she had hidden from me growing up. The ones that kept me up at night and more importantly, kept me in check.

“Who was my father?” My question cut like a blade through the somber silence of the dining room. My mother shot me her signature glare but it was especially threatening in this moment. 
“What?” she growled
“Don’t tell me you’re going deaf already.” I retorted, entranced by confidence. 
“You disgusting little cretin! How dare you speak to me like that!” 
She leapt out of her chair and it scraped on the hardwood floor like nails on a chalkboard. She grabbed the wooden paddle from the counter and stormed towards me. She didn’t even bother telling me to turn around. She swung straight for my face but I caught it before it could make impact. My hand stung and in a fit of rage I snatched the paddle from her and began beating her with it. 

I don’t remember much after that. I blacked out. When I came to, my mom was on the floor in a puddle of her own blood. There was blood on the paddle, on the walls, on me and on my siblings. They looked like those shell shocked soldiers from old war photos. I dropped the paddle and bent down in an attempt to wake my mom up. When she didn’t respond I checked her pulse and, as I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, it was too late. She was dead. 

I wanted to cry but there was no time. We needed to leave and fast. I told my siblings to pack a bag each and I ran upstairs to do the same. 

When I was done, I ran into my mom’s room. This was my last chance to find the answers I’d been looking for and I wasn’t going to waste it. I dug around in her things. I checked draws, cabinets, closets. There had to be something. An old photo album, a letter, something. I stood in the middle of her room and took a moment to think when the Jesus painting that hung over her bed caught my eye. A swarm of bad memories flooded my mind. I leapt towards it and threw it off the wall and onto the floor.

I looked back at the wall and saw that there was a hole in it that had been covered by the painting. It wasn’t a small hole. It had the capacity to home a family of barn owls. I reached in and pulled out a stack of papers from among the many other things that didn’t seem as important. They were hospital records. 

For the first time in my life I felt hope. My birth certificate had to be in here. It would have my father’s name on; maybe he could help us. I found myself lost in this daydream of me and my siblings running into my father’s arms and finally being blessed with a loving home. Unfortunately, that dream would leave as quick as it came. 

I began to read the records and my hope turned into confusion and gut wrenching fear. They were results from fertility tests and they were negative. This had to be a mistake. Of course my mom could get pregnant, she had kids. I threw the papers aside and reached back into the hole. 

I pulled out a stack of three books. They were spell books. Not like pagan ones like…satanic ones. I flipped through them in a last attempt to find anything. I only got through the first one and halfway through the second before I came to a page that had been annotated. It was tilted “pregnancy spell: offer up your womb for the seed of the king.” 

It felt like I had swallowed my own heart. This couldn’t be true. It was ridiculous. I was ridiculous for thinking it was anything other than a look into my mother’s fucked up psyche. Right? Either way, I didn’t have time to think about it. Someone would’ve heard my mother’s screams and it wouldn’t be long until the sheriff was at the door. I grabbed my siblings and ran. 

I didn’t know where I was going, I just kept running until I passed the sign for the town and then kept running for another hour. We slept in the woods for a while until we came across an abandoned warehouse and that’s where we’ve stayed for the last three years. 

I keep me and my siblings fed by stealing from local gas stations as that’s all there really is out here. It’s not much but it’s enough. I’ve also taken up the job of providing my siblings with an education. We were homeschooled so that’s all I really have to go off but I think they’re doing well. 

I don’t leave the warehouse much and i don’t let my siblings leave at all. I try and avoid going outside as much as possible but even then I have to wear a hood and avoid looking at people. This isn’t too hard for me because, if you remember, these were the rules set in place by my mother when we went to church. 

It’s beginning to become clear to me now that something has to change soon. I can’t keep forcing my siblings to live like this. They deserve a proper education, a reliable food source, a home. So I’m writing this in the hopes that someone will take pity on us and find it in their heart to lend a helping hand. I don’t expect that to happen. After all, I am a murderer and possibly the son of Satan. Sorry, bad joke. 

Anyway, that’s all there really is to say right now. I’ll probably post an update if this post gets any attention but for now I have to go and deal with my brother. His horns have started coming in so it’s been non stop whining and crying for the past two months. Puberty right?
