Log 1.

Hello everyone.

I’m not much of a writer. But after today, I figured I’d start keeping track of things.

Maybe you all can make sense of it without comparing our situation to a horror movie while

we’re in the middle of the Pacific. Not helpful.

Here’s a bit of backstory:

I joined this crew two weeks ago as a deckhand.

The ship is called Captains Frown. She is a steel beast made in the 1970s. It’s a bit dated, below deck resembling a 90s sitcom that creaks underfoot. It smells like salt and cigarettes.

The beds are about as hard as the deck. All but the captain share the sleeping quarters. The door there is heavy and cold, makes me feel like I’m sleeping in a dungeon when it's closed.

But the ship is reliable, and the reason any of us can make a living.

She’s big enough for a larger crew. Honestly, we need a larger crew.

I spend most of my time with the other two deckhands, Avery Wright and Nathan Adler. Both younger than me, eighteen and twenty respectively, but both have been here a few months longer then I have.

Avery is the captain’s Nephew, and Nathan is Avery’s best friend, who is only here because Avery put a good word in.

Avery is optimistic; you could argue he is only here for morale.

Nathan is the opposite. He is here to make money to buy his girlfriend of three months an engagement ring, and he makes everyone aware that he does not want to be here for any other reason.

They’ll say they trained me, but honestly, it was mostly Avery giving me the rundown while periodically looking for assurance from whichever older crew member was in orbit.

These included Captain Nolan Wright, a quiet, slightly distant but competent man in his late thirties.

First Mate Cormac O’Connor, mid-forties and very Irish. He has a steady authority that could have earned him the title of Captain if he wanted it. He looks at me differently than the others do. Like he knew I’d try to prove myself and wants me to know I don't need to.

Engineer Noah Miller, twenty-nine, just two years older than me, which makes him feel close to a friend. He pronounces his last name as “Muller” because he insisted there was a typo somewhere along his German family line.

He has a Boston accent. Any German in him is diluted with Dunkin’ Donuts.

Still, he’s a genius. He’s been tracking the activity on the ship long before I got here. I will explain what I mean later.

Lastly, Vincent Gruner, Mechanic and professional bucket sitter. He’s got to be in his late sixties. He’s never told us how old he is, but after Nathan complained about wanting to go home, Gruner responded with “In ‘Nam, you couldn’t go home unless you lost a leg.” I figured he had to have at least been a teenager during that war.

They’re all decent men.

I’ve been on crews with scumbags; this isn’t one of them. They’re not what makes this ship uneasy.

The activity is.

The Captain gets prickly if we talk about it around him. He says boats move, stuff falls, things happen.

Nathan reluctantly admitted to Avery’s TikTok livestream that whispering outside the sleeping quarters door sometimes keeps him up at night.

Today, Avery, earnest but prone to embellishment, swears that he saw a bite mark on Cormac’s arm a few days ago.

“I went to get some gauze for a cut on my hand. I was just us below deck, and I saw O’Connor wrapping up a bite mark. It was small, like a girl bit him. I swear.”

“So what? He must have gotten laid before we left.” Nathan said with a shrug, lighting a cigarette he legally couldn’t smoke.

“Makes sense that the man built like a fridge would like feisty girls.”

Avery cringed like the notion of indecency made his skin itch. I stayed out of it, untangling nets. I preferred to be the odd one out of the deckhand gossip.

“We had been sailing for weeks at that point, but the mark was fresh.” Avery said.

He leaned closer to Nathan, whispering something I couldn’t hear while making a very unsubtle gesture with his head towards me.

Nathan grinned and peeked around him at me.

“Hear that, Russell? Avery wants to know if I think you did it!” He looked back at Avery, playfully jabbing his chest with the two fingers that held his cigarette. “Can’t believe you’d say that about our little gingersnap.”

I ignored them and the warmth blooming under my collar.

Avery looked mortified, turning his pink cheeks away from me.

Nathan looked at me like he expected a rotting fish to get thrown at his head, but turned back to Avery when he got nothing but silence.

Avery cleared his throat. “Th-that’s not what I said.”

His hands fanning out in his pockets, like he needed Nathan to believe him.

“Listen, it looked like it hurt. He also looked confused. I’m just saying, why would he look confused if it was from…that.”

Nathan laughed, blowing smoke from his nose into the chilly fog, entirely uninterested in what Avery had become convinced of.

“Just say sex, ya fucking incel.”

I felt a headache pressing in on my temples from the cigarette smoke. I finished the net, and made my way across the damp deck. Salty mist stinging my lips. I hung the net where Cormac had told me to two weeks before.

Gruner sat on his bucket a few feet away, cleaning a fish for dinner with a knife older than half the crew.

“The boy’s right to be worried.” He said it as if he just told me we’re having fish for dinner again.

I asked what he meant.

“This ship’s been strange for years. I’ve been noticing it for years. Captain don’t like to talk ‘bout it. O’Connor works ‘round it. Boys try an’ film it. Berlin logs it to stop from shittin’ himself. You’re curious ‘bout it, I noticed.”

He dropped the clean fish into a cooler, already starting another, as if it helped him think.

“I guess I’m curious,” I shifted, looking out at sea. He didn’t seem to expect me to stay and listen.

“But that doesn’t mean I believe any of it.”

He paused his work to spit some tobacco over the rails, the ocean misted us in response.

He glanced at me with an expression of someone solving a puzzle that’s been missing pieces for years.

“There’s something else I noticed.”

I tilted my head, leaning my hip against the railing and preparing myself for long-winded advice about layered socks and military knots.

Instead, he dropped the freshly cleaned fish into the cooler on top of the other, then pointed at me with his bloody knife.

“That shit ramped up after you got here.”

Just a statement. A neutral observation he only now felt he had enough data to share.

“What?” I asked.

Gruner didn’t explain, didn’t shrug to soften the blow. Just spit once more, then gripped another fish, and resumed his work as if nothing was amiss.

“Pay attention.”

I’m not sure what exactly is going on here. If any of you have ideas, comment and I’ll read them as long as we’re not in a dead zone.

I’ll see if Miller will let me read his logs, and I’ll also ask Cormac about the bite mark when he slows down for a few minutes.

I’ll update when I know more.
