I was a kid, a simple kid. During the summer I enjoyed going to the pool to swim for a bit and then I biked home. One day when I was biking home I saw a man with a pink sweater and a black beard who was a semi muscular wave to me as I biked. I never thought much of it at first. I went to the pool as usual and began to do my swimming. I had a tendency to want to have a fixed time when I swim so I would end up swimming no longer or no less than an hour.

I then returned home and as I was I saw someone in a green car wave at me. Our community was somewhat small so it was not like this was off-putting though looking back it may have been the man in the pink sweater. I began to see red flags when I began to see him waving to me every single day. He even seems to have brought the bike out. Some parts of me wanted to attempt to run away from him but I chose not to jump to conclusions yet.

The final turning point was when he began to follow me on his bike home on the 4th of July.  In my neighborhood there is a road that is big enough to be called a highway but it’s not really since our community isn’t that big. I would ride my bike around a mile until I got my house riding On sidewalks next the road. I saw him following me on the other side of the road. I continued at my normal speed knowing I had only 10 minutes till I got home. Then I began to worry that if he follows me home  and I successfully got home knowing where I lived he would end up finding a way to cut me off either when I went to the like I do every weekend or I would end up trapped in my house by simple paranoia only coming out when I had to go to school via the school bus. I decide to boldly ride past my house and then take a left into a small neighborhood of my community. I increased my speed a bit. I saw him get off his side of the sidewalk and followed me.

By this point the sun was setting and it seemed most people had gone to the massive field just outside the town to set fireworks. Being the very  introvert kid I was I ended up deciding before this whole mess started that I would just go home and read . I picked up my speed so I would keep a reasonable distance from the man in the pink sweater. I look back. His speed had definitely increased. I then began to rapidly increase my speed and bikes as fast as I could. There are woods nearby with hiking trails I knew like the back of my head since I had gone on walks often here. I road straight through the hiking trails and took a right towards the trail that lead to the one of to a small lake. I was counting on the fact it was dark to lose him in the trails. I looked back and I couldn't see him following me. I arrived at the lake and saw the houses nearby one of those was mine.

Then took my bike to my house and took it inside. I would tell my parents after they came back home. We reported this to the police. The police didn’t do anything since they said we lacked evidence and that the few security cams in the town hadn’t caught anything. They probably wrote it off as a prank call. I never saw the man in the pink sweater again. I assume he suspected I called the police and wouldn't risk what he did again. I was proven wrong 7 years later ironically when I saw on the news that a man had been arrested on 2 charges of child molestation. The man was undoubtedly him. While this made me happy knowing how messed up the legal system is there's always the chance he ends up being released after just 3 years. The best I can hope is that he gets killed in jail or stays locked up for a long time.
