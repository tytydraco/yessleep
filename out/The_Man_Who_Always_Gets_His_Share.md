I don’t know if this is just a recurring dream or something much worse, but I need to get this out. It’s been happening for months now, and I can’t shake the feeling that it’s not just in my head. Maybe someone here will understand.

The first time it happened, I was walking home late at night. The streets were empty, which wasn’t unusual. But then I noticed this narrow alley that I had never seen before. It was always there, I’m sure of it, but it never caught my attention until that night. It was as if it only appeared at this particular hour. I should have kept walking, but something pulled me in.

At the end of the alley was an old hut, barely standing, with a dense forest behind it. The alley seemed to open into another world. And the man—he was waiting for me. His thick beard and dark eyes absorbed all the light around him. Without a word, he opened the door and handed me a folder. Inside was a plan for a jewelry store heist. But not just any jewelry store—this one housed eerie, antique pieces rumored to be cursed. Yet, I took it. I don’t know why. Maybe because it felt like I had no choice.

Before I could ask him anything, I blurted out, “What’s your cut?” He leaned back into the shadows, a slight smile at his lips, and said in a slow, almost amused voice, “Oh, don’t worry, I’ll get my share.”

I should have asked more questions, but I didn’t. I just left, clutching the folder. My team and I planned the heist down to the smallest detail, but from the start, something felt off. We broke into the jewelry store, but the moment we entered, a chill ran down our spines. The jewelry, with its grotesque and unsettling designs, seemed to almost come alive. Alarms blared, and a car chase followed. My team was taken out one by one by unseen forces—shadows flitting around us, whispering voices. I barely escaped. As the chaos intensified, I found myself speeding through dark, unfamiliar streets. The police were closing in, and my car was pushed to its limits.

Just when I thought it was all over, I turned a corner and found myself back at the alley. It was like the streets had twisted and turned, leading me right back. The same narrow path, the same old hut. The man was sitting in a rocking chair at the edge of the forest, not looking at me, just staring out into the trees.

I stood there, shaking, trying to make sense of what had happened. My team was gone, the job a disaster, and yet I was back in this alley. I asked him again, desperate, “What do you want? What’s your cut in this?” He just rocked in his chair, and after a long silence, said again, “Oh, don’t worry, I’ll get my share.”

The second time, I returned to the alley at the same hour, and he had another job ready—a bank this time. But this wasn’t a normal bank. The vault housed bizarre and unsettling artifacts—ancient relics said to be cursed. I wanted to ask him everything—who he was, why I was back here—but instead, I found myself saying, “Why does this keep happening?” He handed me the plan, leaned back, and repeated, “Oh, don’t worry, I’ll get my share.”

We hit the bank, and just like before, everything went wrong. Chased across rooftops by helicopters, the city flashing beneath us. My team fell behind one by one. In a desperate move, I jumped from a helicopter, hoping to escape the chaos below. But instead of landing safely, I crashed onto the hut in the alley. The impact shattered the roof, and I tumbled into the dark, musty interior.

Dazed and battered, I looked up to see the man waiting in his rocking chair, undisturbed by the destruction. The hut, despite its seeming fragility, had somehow absorbed the crash without collapsing. The man was still staring into the forest, as if nothing had happened.

I staggered to my feet, bewildered. I asked, “Why me? Why do I keep surviving?” He didn’t answer, just rocked in his chair, staring into the forest. After an eternity, he repeated his phrase: “Oh, don’t worry, I’ll get my share.”

The third heist was even worse. This time, we were tasked with stealing a collection of macabre items from a gothic mansion—a place filled with strange, haunted relics. The mansion was a labyrinth of dark corridors and rooms filled with creepy, otherworldly artifacts. My team and I were forced to navigate this nightmarish maze, jumping over eerie traps and avoiding strange, glowing entities that seemed to follow us.

The chase took us across the rooftops of the city, leaping from one building to another. The night was filled with the sounds of distant screams and the shadows of grotesque figures flitting about. My team fell behind one by one, taken by the things that seemed to crawl out of the darkness. I raced ahead, pushing myself to the limit, until I made a final leap off a rooftop. As I soared through the air, the city lights below blurred into a swirl of darkness.

I landed in the dense forest behind the hut. The oppressive darkness seemed to close in around me as I sprinted through the twisted trees and tangled underbrush. I could hear faint whispers and see ghostly shapes darting between the trees. Finally, I saw the familiar outline of the hut. As I reached it, I was met by the man, sitting in his rocking chair, as if he had been waiting for me all along.

I didn’t care about the job anymore. I just needed to understand why I was drawn back here. I asked, “What is your share? What are you taking from me?” He sat in silence for a long time, that same distant look on his face. Then, as always, he said, “Oh, don’t worry, I’ll get my share.”

I still don’t know what he means. But every time I return, I feel like I’m losing something, piece by piece. The alley appears only at a specific time, and the man has no records or online presence. I can’t stop feeling this pull towards him and the heists, despite the darkness and the sense of something slipping away. I’m terrified that one day, there won’t be anything left for him to take.
