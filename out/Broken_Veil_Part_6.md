Once you get into a new routine, the days seem to roll by like clockwork. Not that any of those days lacked for excitement. Ward kept us busy with new assignments each day. Noah kept us aware and alert as we traversed every tree and dark corner. 

We had some varied missions as the weeks rolled by. Some went back to the forest, others took us through suburban cul-de-sacs and into the darker alleys of the citie's back lots. 

Our covers were just as interesting. One day we were city inspectors checking on new construction downtown. Another day we were back to being park rangers, hunting down a rumor of a chupacabra. We knew what it was. 

My favorite one, we were disguised as plumbers. A hotel had lost water supply to their ground floor pool and it stopped circulating. Took some diagnosing, turned out an eel-like creature had lodged itself into the filtration system. We had to cut the pipe to remove it, and when it wriggled free of its confinement, Chris was startled backwards when it slithered out after him and he fell into the pool. I hadn't laughed that hard in a while. 

Sam and I handeled the investigations. Several times we followed some obscure trail to the end of the line, scraps left for evidence, only to find the subtle leftover trace of where the veil closed and our person had vanished. Those felt all too familiar, but at least now there was a final preventative measure to seal away the gap. 

One occasion we managed to get to someone in time, a woman out for a jog happened to pass by where an Event tossed out another creature. That time we had to play the part of Animal Control. Me and Chris spun the distraught woman a tale about a rabies infected dog that we had to put down for public safety. I think she will still be signing up for therapy at some point. 

I wasn't sure about the other team's progress, but I felt like we were doing some good work. We brought back tons of data on the breaches, completed our runs early and we kicked back and enjoyed the rest from our hard work just as much. All in all, I was enjoying myself again. 

Still, there were some things that weren't quite on the level for me. 

According to Noah, the openings from the Veil were starting to misbehave. When we would close them, it took a bit longer than expected. Maybe just a few seconds, but some took more effort than others. As if there was more pressure from the other side. Noah would make his recordings and file them but Ward never seemed too concerned about those details. Just affirmed a job well done. 

Declan made a comment the other day about having requested new parts and materials and not all of the orders showed up. It wouldn't be much, smaller items like screws, wire spools and a single stabilizer unit missing. He figured one of the teams was snagging them, although none confessed. 

Come to think of it, Ward never really showed much emotion one way or the other about the situation. Whatever military branch he came from must have hardened him like stone, never wavering in his demeanor. Just acknowledged our reports, passed on the data where it needed to go, and set us up with our next assignments when it was time. I have to say, he was very efficient as Chief of Operations. 

The Director, however, seemed a little more tired each day. Apparently our little township was struggling a bit more to resolve than other places they've worked. New readings kept flowing in, new missions to pin to the board. More investigations meant more paperwork.  

The other teams must have felt the pressure too. Someone finally snapped. 

I came in to the office one day, just me and Noah. Sam and Chris were handling a run on their own. We only had two openings to inspect that day and they offered to go while we stayed and took care of some busy work for Declan. I walked in, coffee in hand with Noah in tow, to find someone shouting, then they tossed something in Declan's direction. 

"Your tech is broken, Rourke. We had to fire three charges into a fissure before it would even budge." The man shouted, stepping up to Declan and poking a finger at him. 

"Two of those things came out after us, and almost got Jack." 

Declan didn't back down. 

"I told you before, you need to calibrate the stabilizers first, otherwise the charges are not as effective." 

"Oh, so its my fault we almost got our faces eaten off!?" 

Declan snickered "In your case, it might be an improvement." 

He lunged at Declan, and the two men struggled for a moment. I quickly set my coffee down and got between them, pushing the man away from Declan. 

"Alright that's enough. Whatever this is, this isn't how to handle it." 

The man squared up to me now. He was slightly taller than me, dark hair greased back over his ears. Mustache that combed over his top lip. Aviator glasses that had just enough tint to block out the sun. 

He was dressed as you might imagine, in jeans, a dark polo shirt, and a solid colored military style jacket with pockets across the chest and a raised collar with a zipper down the middle. I got the sense he was the more "modern" version of me. Albeit with an 80's kind-of style. 

I met his gaze behind the tinted lenses, staring back under the brim of my hat. 

"If you got a problem, we can talk it out, man to man." I said 

He smiled a toothy grin "Big bad wolf to the rescue. Tell me, did you buy that detective outfit in a costume store?" 

"Same place you found that mustache and glasses." 

"Oh. He's got jokes." He snapped back "Why don't you head on back to whatever newspaper comic you fell out of and let the real detectives do their work." 

I smiled "Because guys like you need guys like me to pick up all the slack you leave behind." 

He scoffed "Uh huh. Tell you what, you stick to your side, stay outta my way, and we won't have any issues." 

"Sure thing, slick," I took a step closer, "But you come at my people, and your mustache doesn't make it past 'Go'. Clear?" 

He looked at me for a moment, then turned around and walked back towards the open side door and out of the building. 

People like that irritate me. No respect. 

I turned back to Noah and Declan "So, who was that wanna-be?" 

"Richard Payne," Noah said 

"Dick," Declan corrected "He was a homicide detective in Florida." 

Noah Continued, "He's always been a jerk. I still don't know why they recruited him." 

"He's certainly a pain. What was he going on about?" I asked Declan. 

Declan looked between me and Noah, quietly like someone else might be listening. "Come with me over to the garage." 

We headed out the same side bay and across to one of the smaller buildings. The roller door was up, revealing a workshop inside. All the equipment and tool cabinets were on rollers, making it easy to pack things up if they needed to adjust the space or clear out quickly. 

He had all manner of power equipment and hand tools, and each area was roughly organized for different operations or equipment he was working on. Lathes, a drill press, and machining tools were grouped off to one side. Hand tools, material storage bins, and an electronics work station were on the other side. In the middle was a desk pushed flush against the wall alongside a flat workbench and an old sofa. 

Noah sat down in a high stool by Declan's desk, spinning around once and back to us, resting his arm on the surface. Declan picked a screwdriver off the workbench to fidget between his fingers. 

"Firstly, that guy is an imbecile." He said pointing it out the door, "I've told him three times to calibrate the stabilizers on each run. They have to sync to the anomaly to stabilize it properly." 

Noah nodded along muttering "Mmhmm." 

"But also," he scratched his head, "there are some weird things happening lately." 

"Is there anything wrong with the gear?" Noah asked plainly. 

"No, I don't think so. Im not the only engineer ANCR has, but I've been working on this tech for a while now and it does what it's supposed to. If you use it properly, that is." 

I took a breath "Why does it work at all? What is the Veil supposed to be anyways?" 

Declan thought for a moment. 

"We don't know exactly," he chuckled, "I have a friend who has a theory." 

"Oh yeah?" 

"He worked at the VLA in New Mexico, listening to the stars for signals. He tells me one day, they picked up a reading far out there that matches the exact frequency we track from the Veil. Said the signal emanates, faintly but clear, out of a black hole." 

Noah and I exchanged shocked expressions 

"What?" I blurted out 

"For real? So It's aliens?" Noah said, wide eyed like he had just won a prize. 

Declan laughed heartily "Ah, you should see your faces. No, it's not aliens. At least, none that say 'Hi' back." He paused "That is true though, about the signal... Still, we have no idea what or where the Veil is." 

"It has to be some kind of door, how else are things getting through?" I said 

"It's sort of like a door," he mused, "yet more like a window with a curtain." 

He paused for a moment 

"You both know about Nikola Tesla, right?" 

We nodded. 

Declan leaned back against the bench, arms mid-gesture and eyes forward like he was readying to tell a great story. 

“Back at the turn of the twentieth century,” he began, “Nikola Tesla was obsessed with energy. Not electricity in the way Edison thought of it, all wires and lights, but frequency. How energy moves through space itself.” 

Noah nodded. “Wireless before it was cool.” 

“Before it was safe,” Declan added. “Tesla believed the Earth behaved like a massive conductor. He did all kinds of experiments where he would channel electricity in different ways, absorbing it and sending it out miles away.” 

“So he thought of the planet like a lightning rod?" I asked. 

Declan pointed at me. “Exactly. Only in reverse.” 

He exhaled through his nose. “Wardenclyffe Tower was supposed to prove it. True wireless power. Global communication. Free energy sent to anywhere on the planet.” 

Noah swiveled in his chair. “But, it didn't work?" 

"No... Not the way he wanted." He said. 

"He was at his wits end trying to make it work. The tower needed more power, but it was operational. The investors backed out. He was livid, but determined to make it work. That night, in a blind fury, he turned it on. Maxed out every generator in the tower to critical. And then..." 

He clapped his hands together 

"It fired a pulse of energy so powerful that it split the sky." 

  

Noah was hanging on the edge of his seat. So was I. 

“Tesla didn’t just hit the Earth’s natural frequency,” he said. “He rung it like a bell." 

He tapped the edge of metal bowl with his screwdriver, making it sing for emphasis. 

"Loud enough that whatever boundary separates… well, here from there, it cracked.” 

I felt a chill creep up my spine. “You’re saying he tore a hole in reality?” 

Declan shook his head slowly. “No. It was more like he cracked the window.” 

“The experiment shut down before it could stabilize. Equipment, now broken, was dismantled. Tesla died thinking he failed.” 

Noah spoke quietly. “But the crack didn’t go away.” 

Declan nodded. “It held. Weak at first. Decades passed. Technology advanced. Now there's radios, radar, satellites. Each one nudged the same harmonics again and again.” 

"That's when the cracks started getting bigger." I continued his thought. 

He looked at me then. “Yes. Anyone and anything close enough could accidently slip through without warning. People, and cars. Planes disappeared mid flight. Ships would vanish, and sometimes reappear, damaged and abandoned." 

"What about the creatures?" I asked 

Declan's jaw tightened, "Thats a new thing, they say. Over the last few years, the breaches started, a few were big ones." He nodded towards Noah, "But the number is increasing. Thats where we are now." 

We sat for a moment staring at the floor. 

Finally, Noah spoke. “Then why is it getting worse?” 

He looked between us. 

“We close the Veil every time we find an opening. Why isn’t that enough?” 

Declan thought for a moment. 

"It should be. We've always been able to repair the cracks, nice and neat, but it feels different now. Besides, we don't really know what it's like on the other side." 

"Did anybody ever try to look?" I asked. 

Noah turned to me, "Yeah, they did a few times. I sent my own drone in there but the footage is always scrambled, even with a direct connection. Besides..." he exhaled, "you saw what happened to the monsters. Same thing probably happens to people." 

"No one has ever survived going to the other side." Declan confirmed. 

He snapped his fingers "Maybe... the tech works, but maybe the method is off." He started pacing, "What if we're just throwing stones in the pond, trying to stop the waves, but instead the waves just amplify. You end up with bigger waves. More frequency." 

"And now," I continued, "the waves are starting to swamp the boat." 

He nodded, but before he could say more, we heard the sound of screeching tires and brakes locking up. We ran out to see the old Forestry truck was back. Chris was leaning halfway in the passenger side, then he pulled out Sam in his arms. She had a tourniquet tied around her left shoulder, her lower arm covered in blood. 

"Get the medic, now!" He shouted. 

She was quickly taken from his arms to a stretcher and wheeled into the adjacent building, which housed a makeshift field hospital. 

"What happened, Chris?" I asked as he approached us. 

He had this flustered appearance, like he had run a marathon, but his eyes were steady. 

"We were able to get the first Tear closed, but the second... Just a moment after it collapsed, it tore open again. A big one came through, all teeth, spikes and some sort of bone plating. It got ahold of Sam's arm and slung her to the ground. Took all the ammo I had to bring it down." 

I put a hand on his shoulder, "You got her back safe. You did good." 

He shook his head slowly, "I was late. These things are getting worse, Derrick. I don't know whats going on." 

"We were just talking about that." Noah piped up. 

"Why don't you come in here and take a seat," Declan offered, "I'll fetch you somethin' to drink while you take a break." 

We waited for hours. Every minute felt like an eternity. Finally the surgeon came around to see us. 

"She's gonna be okay," She said, "Above the elbow was lacerated and torn severely. Unfortunately we had to amputate, but we have her mended now. You can see her, but go easy. She is still groggy and will need her rest." 

"Thanks Doc." I replied. 

he guys left it up to me to check on her. Said it would feel more professional from me, one ex-officer to another, but I admit I was worried about her. 

The setup was clean for being put together in an old storage building. A full operating room in the back with a sterile environment screen and filtering, and multiple beds with separate curtains off to the side. 

Sam had the middle one. Ward was already there at the foot of her bed, standing straight, arms folded behind his back as usual. He nodded as I stepped beside him. 

She lay there under the sheets, connected to several wires and IVs. An oxygen tube hooked into her nose. Her left shoulder was wrapped up in a blanket of gauze. 

I stood beside him, reading his posture for a moment, then turning to Sam. Ward finally let his mask slip a little. Through his professional demeanor I could tell he was uncomfortable. 

"She's being transfered to West Lake Medical," he stated, " It's a days drive from here, but they have a good trauma wing. She's out of this fight now." 

We stood in silence for a moment, listening to the sound of beeping and whirring from the machines. Sam breathed slowly and steadily, eyes closed. 

"She's fortunate," he finally said "Owens' field tourniquet prevented major blood loss." 

He turned to me "He did good, Wolfe. Got the situation handeled, and got her out quick." 

I thought to pass on his compliments to Chris, though I doubted he would agree with the praise. 

He turned back to her, "We will get this under control soon enough, seal up the cracks for good." 

His phone started ringing. 

"I need to take this," he said, frowning at his smart watch, "rest up, we'll talk later." He said, regarding Sam and nodded to me before stepping out.

I stepped up beside her now, my hands clasped together in front of me. Her eyes fluttered open slowly and she looked around. 

"Hey... it's me," I said, "the guys wanted to check in on you." 

She cracked a smile, I grinned back, "You look like you could use a drink. Too bad I forgot to bring my stool." I teased 

She laughed weakly then winced at the pain. I gave her an apologetic smile for my dry humor. 

"He's got a point, you know." She said weakly. 

"About?" 

"Getting a handle on things." She said looking up to me. 

I leaned in closer with my hands rested onto the side rail of her bed so she didn't have to strain. 

"I've worked with Ward before. He led the team in Arizona, back when he was a field agent and not the manager." 

I nodded "What was he like then? 

"The same. Smart. Calm. Always three steps ahead. He believed in the mission, but was driven for the results," she said with a short cough interrupting her, "he was efficient, planned for the best outcome, always got the job done." 

She looked me in the eyes "I'm worried about him. The Veil is getting worse, and we haven't heard anything about plan B yet. I know he has it covered, but keep an eye on him, Derrick. Things might get worse before we can fix it." 

"Hey, don't you worry about that. You've got some capable guys around here, im sure we will figure it out." 

"I know you will," She said, "You boy's make a great team." 

I smiled "We all do." 

"Promise me something." 

"Yeah?" 

"When we finally get all the cracks taken care of around here, you'll take out that girl you mentioned." She stated, raising an eyebrow. 

"You mean Gabs?" 

"Yeah, Gabs." She turned her head to face me more, "Don't let all of this keep you from doing right by her, and yourself." 

I shook my head, "I'm not sure an old wolf like me can do much right in that department." 

She chuckled "An old wolf like you, deserves his happy ending." 

I simply nodded. Not sure whether to agree or disagree on that point. Maybe it was her med's talking. 

"Get some rest, Sam. Get well." 

I left her bedside and strolled out of the building into the sunlight. I looked back and whispered to myself, "Happy retirement, Sam. You've earned it." 

The rest of the day left me with a lot to ponder over. We were headed towards something, and fast. I wasn't sure if it was a brick wall or a cliff. Sam was right though. We weren't given any new instructions about the Veil, just the same routine and be sure to check the equipment. I thought about what She said, about what Declan mentioned, if our method was now falling short of the goal and we needed a new strategy. 

Come to think of it, our stoic commander was much more absent lately. Not that he was here 24/7 anyways, he normally delegated tasks to his subordinates but he seemed a lot more absent even when he was here. His meetings with the Director had gotten more serious judging by their expressions when they exit the room upstairs. 

Surely Mason was kept busy dealing with logistics and the issues that are starting to arise, with the Veil pushing back harder and our agents getting injured. Sam wasn't the only one, but was the worst off. We kept busy too, keeping up our workload, but my gut told me this wasn't the priority now. Or more likely, someone wasn't allkwed off their leash. 

Some red flag kept waving in the back of my mind, though I wasn't entirely sure yet which way it was pointing. I reported to Ward now, as acting Field Lead for the team. He gave us our usual run of work to do. 

"Heres the agenda for the day. Three new targets to inspect and close out. Also a few areas to inspect for possible breaches." 

I scrolled through the list of preliminary data. Seems like the list was shorter than usual. It all felt very copy and paste. 

"Any new directions regarding the tears?" 

"No," he said flatly, "We've experienced variables like this before, just proceed as normal. If you need backup, we can route another team to your location." 

I held the pad, trying to read him as he divided his focus around the room. He turned back to me. 

"That's all, Wolfe. Good luck out there." 

We proceeded through our day. Business as usual without any incident, thankfully,  although the anxiety was there for it. The Veil openings took a full minute and a half longer to close now. Thats about eighty seconds too long for my liking. My hand stayed resting against my leather holster as we counted down until each one would finally close. 

We managed to finish up our day early, ending about 2:00pm, then we took a late lunch. We sat around one of the old picnic tables at the Eastside park, enjoying something hot and cheap from the corner store nearby. Noah was slurping on a microwaved bowl of cheap ramen, Chris got some wrap with beef, and I grabbed a hot sandwich. 

Between the sounds of our chewing I finally came to a decision about something that had been rattling around in my brain. 

"Hey Noah, you said your good with software, right?" 

"Yeah?" 

"You know how to find back doors into things, get into data storage?" 

He tilted his head a little, "I open doors to other dimensions. Hacking private data is a piece of cake." 

Chris laughed "Technically, we ring the doorbell." 

Noah snorted "Technically, we throw bombs at aliens. But whatever," he turned back to me, "What do you want to get into?" 

"I want to look into Spyglass, see what the data logs are showing versus what we're seeing out here." 

Noah looked to Chris and then back to me, "Okay..." Noah said slowly, still unsure. 

I glanced between them. "Isn't it odd to either of you that there's no updates on the procedures? No new equipment for Declan to give us, or any new action from the analysts to help figure out whats going on?" 

They looked to each other then back to me. 

"Yeah, it has gotten pretty stale," Chris said "we used to get more detailed data, but a lot of it hasn't changed much lately. Like we had an uptake in reports, then it flat-lined." 

Noah had a far away look in his eye, like he was looking through us at something else. 

"I didn't say anything yet because I wasn't sure if I've been reading things right... I thought maybe the Spyglass program was a little buggy, so I've been taking my own readings with my old storm chaser software." He said, setting his drink down, "I've been monitoring the harmonics the Veil produces, the signal we follow to find them. The resonance fluctuates, normally, before spiking where a tear occurs." 

"Yeah?" I said

"The resonance has been drifting. It's the same frequencies, but its been changing slightly. Getting stronger. The fluctuations are spread out a lot further than before." 

He looked at me now, a hint of fear in his eyes. "I'm afraid we might be in the calm before the storm." 

"We need to get in there and find out what's going on," Chris said, "get the real data. As much as the system monitors, it has to have it stored somewhere in the servers." 

"Yeah, but it's not like we can just log in," Noah said, "it's definitely encrypted. There's all kinds of sensitive data that it sorts through constantly. There's a lot we can't see." 

I thought for a second "We need the Director's access. If anyone is able to see the data, without restrictions, it's Mason." 

"Well, if we're gonna do this," Chris began, "we better get Declan on-board. Only technicians are allowed in the server room and he's in charge of the maintenance.  Besides, if we get caught, he will be in hot water too." 

We were in agreement with what we were about to do. With that, we finished up our lunch, packed up and headed back to HQ to end our shift early for the day and then speak to the man himself. What we wanted to do, what I convinced us to do, was a serious breach in protocols, so I had to be certain Declan was willing to risk it. 

We met him out in his garage and slowly explained the plan to him and our reasoning behind it. I knew he was listening intently because his hands were in his pockets instead of fidgeting with a tool. The only thing that moved was his eyes shifting between us as we each took our turn speaking. 

Declan listened without interrupting.

He stood there, occasionally nodding as we laid it out. The missing data, the odd absences, the feeling that our oversight wasn't giving us the whole picture. 

Declan scratched his beard. “So,” he said slowly, “what are you actually hoping to find?.” 

“Hopefully, missing data.” Chris said. “The updated logs, equipment orders, anything really thats been left out.” 

“The truth.” I said flatly 

Noah chipped in "All I need is access, I can take it from there." 

Declan sighed. “And if I say no?” 

I looked him in the eye. “Then we stop. Right here.” 

That gave Declan pause. As if us not doing this sounded worse. 

He glanced out the bay door, then back at us. “You’re not chasing a theory,” he said. “I've been watching and listening. I know its getting bad out there." 

He turned to me "I've also had more equipment turn up missing. nobody knows or seems to care.” 

Chris nodded. “So, you'll help?" 

"Im in," he said, "but I can do better than access." 

He moved over to the electronics workbench, reached into his kit and pulled out a small device with a few cables attached. “Its a diagnostic relay. If anyone checks the server, it’ll look like routine maintenance. While the system's in diagnostic mode, It's the only time your able to get around all the firewalls, no log-in required.” 

Noah grinned. “I like him." 

He chuckled " Hey, I'm only giving ya our most critical blind spot, so let's not get too comfy about risking our hides." 

We hooked Declan up to our comms and sent him to work. We thought he might have been caught when one of the analysts asked why he was going to run another diagnostic on the system after they just ran one that morning. Declan told him "I don't want 'Payne in the arse' to throw a wrench at my head if his tablet doesn't refresh fast enough for him." That let him right on by into the server room. He locked the door behind himself. 

Declan whistled softly as he worked, complaining about outdated hardware for the benefit of his captive audience. 

"Okay," he said over the earpiece, "diagnostics are active. Go ahead kid." 

Noah didn’t waste time. 

He plugged in an external hard drive and opened up his software. His fingers moved fast, typing in commands into a custom system prompt, keying in passwords and executing his coded break-in. It was a bit over my head, but he did his thing. 

“Okay… normal traffic… anomaly reports… archived field analytics…” 

Then he slowed. 

“Huh,” he said. “That’s odd.” 

I leaned in toward his screen. “What is it?” 

“GPS logs,” Noah said. “But they’re scrubbed. Someone removed the identifiers, and the timestamps. There might be some coordinates left in the meta data.” 

Chris frowned. “Whose GPS?” 

“Save it," I said, "Might be the Director, or Ward.” 

"Already done,” Noah said. “Encrypted local copy.” 

He kept digging. 

Personnel transfers. Equipment requisitions. Timestamps for video calls. What would normally be mundane logistics, but we viewed everything with a critical eye. This wasn't our smoking gun yet, but Noah was getting warmer. 

Then he stopped completely. 

There it was. We all saw it at the same time. A directory that technically didn't exist in the main database. No name. No description. Just a blacked out storage file sitting behind layers of security that made Noah hesitate mid-keystroke. The clearance level to this was labeled "Overwatch". Nobody knew what it was, but were certain we weren't meant to open this. 

“I can't break into it,” Noah said quietly. “Not without triggering all the alarms.” 

“Can you take it?” I asked. 

Noah nodded. “Yeah. Whatever’s in there, I can lift the whole thing. But the security comes with it too.” He turned back to me. 

“Do it.” 

With a click of the keyboard, a progress bar crawled forward. When it finished, none of us spoke for a moment. Noah unplugged the hard drive and held it in his hand as if it would bite him. 

Chris broke the silence. “So. Now what?” 

I already knew the answer. 

“There’s one person I trust with this,” I said. “And she’s going to hate that I waited this long.” 

Noah smirked. “Gabs?” 

“Yeah, Gabs” I confirmed. 

We all sat around now in Declan's workshop. All eyes on me as I scrolled through my contacts. My finger hovered over the button for a moment. Feeling the pressure, I stood up and slowly walked out under the afternoon sky. Why did calling her make me more anxious than shooting at monsters? 

It's more than just hearing her voice again after so long. I was about to invite her into our secret world, a dangerous one with monsters, secret organizations and cracks in reality itself. Bringing her in puts her in danger... But, I trust her. I know I can count on her. 

My finger found the button, and the call started ringing. 

I took one look back to the guys. Declan was reclined back casually on his chair. Noah and Chris both gave me a thumbs up. 

Ring... 

Ring... 

My heart Pounded. 

"Hello? Derrick?" She answered. 

"H-hey Gabs. Its been a while." I said, my voice a little more nervous than I wanted. 

"Hey! Yeah, it has. How are you? Last I heard you retired, how did that happen?" 

She asked as if I had broken a leg. 

"Well, sort of. It didn't stick though. I'm working private now, on the side." 

"Figures," she laughed, "You never could stay still for long. Well, got any good cases?" she paused "Or... leads?" 

I froze for a moment, "No, mostly new stuff..."  I knew what, rather, who she was referring to. 

I cleared my throat. "You know, I do miss working with you, Gabs. Would you... Would you mind catching up over dinner? Maybe my place?" 

I could almost feel her smile through the phone. "Yeah, I would like that. It would be great to see you again. It's not the same around here without you, ya know." 

"Okay, great. See you tomorrow at six then?" 

"Yep, that's perfect. I'll see you there." 

We said our goodbyes and hung up. I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding. 

Dinner with Gabs. I never thought we would go there, certainly not like this. A hand surprised me on my shoulder, I turned to see Chris. 

He smiled and Nodded, "Don't worry, I've got your back. We all do." 

I returned his smile. There's a lot riding on this dinner date. Not just cracking open an encrypted file, but hopefully convincing her we all hadn't gone crazy when we tell her why. But I'm feeling confident, despite my jitters. Especially knowing my team is right beside me every step.
