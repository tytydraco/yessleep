I feel bad for this, but I did some [snooping on Grayson](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1aosl0t/how_to_survive_college_do_not_pet_the_strange/).  Well, maybe I’m being too harsh on myself.  I’m allowed to ask friends for advice about my relationship, right?  That’s a totally normal thing to do.  There’s nothing wrong with asking someone their opinion on your boyfriend, right?

I mean, it’s not that big of a deal if the person you’re asking for advice isn’t human, right?

I brought a bribe to the laundry lady.  I was having trouble finding anything as spectacular as last time, which isn’t surprising, it’s kind of hard to beat out a muff/purse covered in weasel tails.  I settled for this little slip dress that had an outer layer of lace.  It looked like it’d snag on anything thrown in the wash with it.  Also the tag said “dryclean only” and I spilled a bit of coffee on it and let it dry so there’s a nice challenging stain on there.

The laundry lady grumbled at me for not trying to rinse the coffee out before it stained, but I think secretly she was pleased.  She folded it nicely and set it aside on the bench next to her.  I no longer had dorm access, so I couldn’t bring my laundry to the washers, but like the devil she had an uncanny sense for knowing I was looking for her.

“How does the campus boundaries work, anyway?” I asked.  “Are you able to go to the laundromat?  It’s right across the street.”

“I can’t leave the grounds,” she replied sullenly.  “I’ve been trying to stretch my influence far enough to get to the laundromat, but the ownership changes hands every damn year it seems like, and I can’t get a foothold.  That’s part of the reason I was building my whole laundry-hell, you know.”

Trying to amass power, I suppose.  Or get a strong enough foothold in the gray world that she could then link it to another location?  I’m not sure exactly how that works and she seemed wholly disinterested in explaining.  Besides, that wasn’t what I was there for.  I was just hoping that I could get her to do my laundry again without having to carry a big bag of it onto campus.

“You said last time that Grayson owes you,” I said.  “What do you know about him?”

“You’re poking around in something you shouldn’t,” she replied promptly.  “Us inhumans - we don’t involve ourselves in his business.  I’m not an expert on humans, but I assume you should be doing the same.”

Probably shouldn’t tell her that we’re dating.

“The flickering man got involved.”

“He was a special case.”

I sat in silence for a moment, trying to figure out how to phrase my question.  I wasn’t even sure how to distill everything I’m feeling down into words that an inhuman could answer.  Could I trust Grayson?  Was this thing I’ve got going with him worth the risk or was I clinging to it out of comfort?  Do I want to save him because I want to prove he could be saved?  That we don’t have to lose the ones we love like my mother lost my father?

That we aren’t helpless when facing the inhuman, that we can be more than prey or victims, that we can defy our fate?

I’m not sure what my reasons are anymore.

“Listen,” the laundry lady said abruptly, cutting off anything I could hope to say.

She turned to me and grabbed my hands, holding them in her dry, papery fingers.

“I like you,” she continued.  “You’re trying to do everything right and I have to say that I respect that.  So let me give you a piece of advice: stay away from Grayson.  You’re going to get hurt if you don’t.”

Well that’s encouraging.

She didn’t give me a chance to ask anything more.  She grabbed the lace dress and then hastily stood and walked off, moving briskly enough that it was obvious she was trying to get away from me.  Like she didn’t want to be seen with me after revealing something so crucial about Grayson.  I didn’t go after her.  She’s taken a risk just giving me that warning.  I understand that.

I haven’t decided if I want to take her advice.  I feel like I want to know more before I just throw all this between us away.  But fortunately? unfortunately? reality has conspired to put a bit of distance between us for the past few weeks.

I got a call from my former manager.

I was in my room when I got the call and for a moment I was almost too surprised to answer the phone.  I mean, she kind of fired me last year, after all.  But I answered and she dove right into what she wanted.

“Listen,” she said, “I need to ask a favor.  And I’m real sorry to be doing this, especially after I fired you, but I think you might be the best person to deal with this problem.  Can you swing by the coffee shop today?”

I don’t dislike my former boss.  I feel like she was making the best decision she could at the time.  Or at least, that’s how I’m rationalizing it.  Cassie has other opinions, once she had the full story.  Very strong opinions.  There was a full week where she was calling my former boss nothing but “that coward” until I finally asked her to stop.

I agreed to meet her after my next class.  There was a bit of a line when I got to the coffee shop, which wasn’t unusual for this time of day.  We were between some popular timeslots for class and a lot of students tried to squeeze in a coffee break before their next class.  I probably made many people late to class during my time as a barista.  I hopped in line because it’d been a while since I had a good pumpkin spice latte and I’d managed to talk my manager into keeping those permanently on the menu instead of them only being a seasonal beverage.

It’s my greatest contribution to this world, I feel.  If you go to my school: you’re welcome.

I didn’t have to wait very long, as my manager popped out of the back to help with the rush and quickly saw me waiting in line.  She waved me over, made me my latte (the largest size, even!) and then invited me into the back office to chat.  I felt eyes on my back as I departed, but I think it was just the other students, jealous that I’d just cut the entire line, rather than anything sinister.

“Have you… seen the possums lately?” I asked as I sat down on the other side of her desk.

Her office was cramped, shoved into a room that barely had enough space for the desk and a few chairs.  It was lit by a single, faltering lightbulb overhead, giving the entire space the feel of a prison cell.  My former boss had attempted to lighten the atmosphere with some fake flowers and posters of waterfalls, but it stubbornly retained that sterile, lifeless atmosphere of a place that was merely meant to be functional and nothing else.

“I haven’t,” she said.  “They stopped coming by sometime in the spring.  Did you have something to do with that?”

My former boss was refreshingly direct in private.

“That might have been me,” I replied.  “Sort of.  I had help.”

“Is this a legitimate ‘I had help’ or a ‘my imposter syndrome won’t let me take credit for anything’ ‘I had help’?”

“The first one.”

The cemetery’s groundskeeper’s dog did all the work, right?  That counts as having help.  (if your memory is as bad as mine, the possum mom got squished? by what appeared to be a… thing… made out of tree roots in the graveyard)

“Well, knowing when to bring in the right people is a good skill to have,” she said.  “Which is coincidentally why I called you.  Do you want another job?”

I can’t say I particularly enjoyed being a barista, but it would certainly be nice to not have to keep my spending under $30 a week so I don’t run out of money before the end of the school year.

Then my former manager told me it wouldn’t be at the coffee shop and it wasn’t because she felt bad for doing me dirty last year and wanted to make up for it.  Okay she didn’t say the second part but I feel she implied it.  Rather, she wanted me to investigate a situation.  Food was going missing in surprising quantities at one of the dining halls.  The person that managed that particular hall had asked her for help, as she had some experience dealing with… *ravenous*… entities.  She’d spent some time over there and didn’t see anything out of the ordinary, but the amount of time she could actually spare for the dining hall was limited.  She wanted someone else to help cover the hours she couldn’t be present.

“I’ve already talked to the manager,” she said.  “He’s onboard with this.  I figured he could move your schedule around to cover different times, until you see something out of the ordinary.  And if you want to keep working there afterwards, he’s happy to keep you on.  I vouched for you.”

I hesitated.  I had enough to worry about already.  Relationship problems, inhuman problems, and of course the ever-present anxiety of keeping my grades up so the devil doesn’t show up for another seemingly unending study session.  I’m not as worried about failing my classes and losing my scholarship anymore, but honestly after experiencing the devil… *stopping time*… until I had studied to his satisfaction I think I’d prefer to fail.

Then my former boss played her trump card.

“Oh, and he said he’ll pay you a bonus if you figure it out.”

I agreed immediately.

“A job?  Are you sure you’ve got time for that?” Cassie asked, when I got back to the apartment and told her.

“I think I actually do,” I said.  “I’m not having to do all that catch-up work like I was the first year here.”

Then I told her about the *other* angle to this job, that I was there to keep an eye out for why the dining hall’s ingredients were disappearing.  She was less enthused about the job upon hearing that.

“Ashley,” she finally said, “have you considered *not* getting involved in literally everything that comes your way?”

“It’ll be fine.  I’m just going to keep an eye out and let the manager know what I see.  I don’t have to do anything else.  That’ll be the extent of it.”

“Oh yeah sure I’ve heard that before.”

She even rolled her eyes at me.  I was mildly offended.

Regardless of her misgivings, she didn’t try to talk me out of it.  And if you notice, I took my sweet time writing this update so that y’all couldn’t try to talk me out of it too.  Though I do feel I made the right choice here.  This isn’t like with Daniel, who I couldn’t save because he wouldn’t help himself.  I’m not holding myself responsible for the things I can’t control.  I’m helping someone because they asked.  I’m doing something within my abilities.  And I’m not responsible for the outcome.

I met with the manager of the dining hall the week after my talk with my former manager.  He has a tiny office that I walked past a few times in the hallway outside the dining hall before I finally noticed his name in tiny letters on the door.  Larry.  I reflected for a moment that I’d never actually met someone named Larry before.  Then I knocked on the door and a tired, harried voice told me to come on in.

A short, middle-aged man with drooping cheeks and dark circles under his eyes sat behind a desk.  I introduced myself and explained that my former manager sent me.  He brightened slightly at that.  Only slightly.  I gingerly sat down, navigating around the pile of umbrellas leaning against the wall.

“I forget mine at home a lot,” he said, noticing me eying them.  “So I try to keep a supply at the office for when I walk home.”

“You’re comfortable going out in the rain?”

“I kind of have to be.  You students might be able to call off at a moment’s notice or skip class, but I can’t.”

There was a sharp edge to this, a hint of a complaint.  I suppose he was more than a little annoyed at the unreliability of his employees.

“And you’re… aware of what’s out in the rain?” I asked.

I wanted to see how familiar he was with the things happening on campus and if he was willing to discuss it openly.  He waved a hand dismissively.

“I asked for help, didn’t I?” he said, which really wasn’t a direct answer.

I guess that told me enough.  He didn’t want to admit to anything.  Not out-loud.  He seemed uncomfortable just answering that much.  I saw him glance to the corner of his desk a couple times, where an assortment of over the counter pill bottles were clustered.  Antiacids, mostly.  I felt bad for the guy.  This situation must be really stressing him out.

He seemed a bit more comfortable explaining the specifics of what was happening.  Food was going missing, which I already knew from talking with my former manager.  The losses far exceeded what he’d expect of regular old theft, however.  This was way more than just a box of pasta here and there.  The pantry was emptied.  Sometimes the fridge was cleared too.  He’d had to do a number of emergency restocks at a pretty premium and while the university didn’t question it, after the latest incident he got the impression that they would really prefer if he made it stop sooner rather than later.

The pantry and fridge were locked when the dining hall was closed.  The locks hadn’t been broken when the food went missing.  He hadn’t bothered trying to install cameras, as the university had pretty strict rules about that and he felt they wouldn’t agree.  I supposed that made sense, if the administration was trying to keep things quiet about the inhuman presence.  Still, he could have bought some battery powered ones and not told anyone, right?  He seemed resigned while he was explaining the meager steps he’d taken to solve the problem and I was starting to suspect that bringing me in to help was more my former manager’s idea than his.

“Does this only happen when it rains?” I asked when he was done.

“I… haven’t tracked that,” he admitted.

It was starting to feel like he wasn’t trying to solve the problem so much as foist it off onto someone else.  I wrote him off as a dead end and let him go over orientation.  He wanted me in the kitchen so I could keep an eye on the pantry and walk-in freezer, so I’d be doing mostly dishwashing.  It was easy enough that I wouldn’t have to focus on learning a new skill while also keeping an eye out of the inhuman.

Between class, homework, and this new job I didn’t have a lot of time for anything else.  Grayson and I texted a bit, but we weren’t able to meet a whole lot in person.  I did tell him what I was doing for the dining hall and he was interested.  I didn’t promise anything.  I made it sound like I wasn’t confident I’d find anything, but really, I’m not sure I should tell him anything yet.  Not after what happened to the laundry lady.

And it seems like I made the right decision there.

I’m sure *absolutely everyone* saw this coming, but the thing eating all the food didn’t show up until it was raining.  It was early in the day and the dining hall was getting ready to open for breakfast.  The handful of student employees that were there were all sleep-deprived, like usual, and completely not in the mood for our manager’s fake cheerfulness.  Most of them found ways to be busy elsewhere, toting the ingredients for omelettes out to the front of the dining hall and the likes.

It was after we had everything out and were about to open for the day when I realized that there was something disturbing the pantry.  I glanced around the kitchen to take note of where everyone was.  I wasn’t alone, so that was reassuring.  There were two other people with me, engrossed in prepping ingredients for lunch.  They hadn’t noticed the noises coming from the pantry.  It was a shuffling noise, of things being moved around with a sporadic randomness that was more akin to an animal rooting about instead of a human deliberately searching for something.

I edged the door and peered around the corner.  The lights were off and it took a moment for my eyes to adjust to the darkness.  I stood there, heart pounding, watching unesaily as a human figure rummaged about on the shelves.  Then it seized something with both hands and clutched it close to its chest as it turned around so that the front of its body was facing the door.

It was the manager.

He looked pale.  Feverish.  Sweat beaded on his brow.

He had in his hands a box of macaroni.  Then he raised it high, tilted his head back, and shoved it into his mouth.  His jaw creaked and cracked, opening wider and wider to accommodate the box.  I watched in horror as his throat swelled in size as he swallowed, the corner and edge of the cardboard clearly visible as it slid down his taut throat.  There were tears in the corners of his eyes.  Then the box was gone.  He rubbed at his stomach, burped, and reached for another box.

I watched him clear the entire shelf.  I didn’t dare try to stop him.  I was too afraid to even reach for the cellphone in my back pocket, not even to take a photo or video for evidence.  I know the stories.  I know what these sorts of creatures do.  When they run out of food… they look for the nearest source of human flesh.

And if I interrupted his feeding… that would be me.

So I stood there, not quite frozen in fear this time, but more frozen by my sense of self-preservation.  I watched as he ate and ate, shuffling down the shelf and shoving everything in his mouth, packaging and all.  When he reached the door to the walk-in fridge, he opened it and stepped inside.

I forced myself to follow him.  I was holding my breath and my hands were shaking, but I followed him.  I needed to know, I rationalized.  I’d have to figure out a way to tell him what was happening and I didn’t want to have to admit I just left him in this state because I was scared.  So I moved up through the pantry until I was just outside the door of the fridge.  He was inside, shoving a package of raw bacon into his mouth.

Then he turned around.  No - his head whipped around and the rest of his body followed.  His eyes were bulging and they shone with unshed tears.  He took a tilting step towards me, one shoulder higher than the other, and I could hear his bones creaking as he walked.  His stomach gurgled and he opened his mouth, his jaw hanging lower than any human jaw should.

He didn’t recognize me.  I saw the hunger in his eyes.

A wild, desperate thought came to me.

“Sammy dropped a bottle of maple syrup,” I said.  “Do we have more in stock back here?”

He blinked at me and somehow, that small gesture seemed to push his eyes back into their sockets.  He whipped his head around again and his body seemed to follow a bit slower this time.

“Oh,” he said after a moment.  “Did… did something happen here?”

He sounded bewildered.  He turned his head back and forth, surveying the pantry shelves.  Then he looked back at me.

“It happened again,” he said hollowly.  “Please tell me you saw something.”

I forced myself to smile.  Didn’t he notice the panic in my eyes?  Didn’t he see how forced my chagrin was?

“I’m afraid not,” I said.  “I was helping carry the pancake batter out.  I came back to the kitchen just in time to see you walk into the pantry.  Whatever cleaned it out did it fast.”

He nodded, clearly disappointed, and mumbled something about maybe we’ll have better luck next time.  He rubbed at his stomach.  Burped a little.  Then he teetered off, mumbling something about needing to figure out how  we were going to get the ingredients for dinner service.

I keep thinking about all those medications on his desk.  Does he think it’s mere indigestion that’s making him sick?  I mean, that’s the obvious assumption.  Not many people would think, oh, I’m turning into *something* that isn’t quite human and sneaking into the fridge to eat cardboard and plastic and raw bacon.

He has all those umbrellas in his office.  He’s routinely going out in the rain.  Is he changing?  Is he becoming something like the security on campus, who are not entirely in control of their own minds?  Or is he changing into something else entirely?

It makes me wonder if all the creatures on campus used to be someone, until the rain permanently changed them.

I think about how when Maria was turned into something else by the rain she didn’t remember what had happened to her.

I’m not going to tell him myself.  Not without having a better idea of how he’d take the news.  I’m going to talk to my former manager instead, tell her what I saw, and let her decide how to handle it.  She knows him better than me, so hopefully she’ll know a diplomatic way to speak with him.  A way that ensures I still get the bonus I was promised.

I really want that money.[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
