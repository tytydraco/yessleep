I'll start this off with some background details, because that makes the most sense in this sort of thing, doesn't it? 

I live in the suburbs. It wasn't always that way, but it has been for the majority of the time that I can remember. I'm sire I don't need to tell you that, as a kid, life can get pretty boring. Especially if you're the sort that struggles with making friends.

Now, personally, I wouldn't call myself a "Bad Kid", but I did tend to get into trouble. I mean, what else was I supposed to do? If I wasn't vandalizing Mrs. Sandra's house, cutting the tires on the car in front of the house that everyone called the Witch's House, then I'd be sitting in my room, staring at a TV like almost everyone else.

The worst part for everyone else, really, was the fact that I didn't get in trouble over it. My parents were so busy patting themselves on the back for raising a kid that goes outside, that they didn't really pay attention to what I was doing. So I got away with it, and somewhere along that path I started growing up. 

When I was fifteen my parents had a rather particular conversation with me. One about 'responsibilities' and 'aging'. Essentially; I had a curfew, and was now freely allowed to roam beyond the neighborhood. Fun, right?

It wasn't. I didn't have a license, and vehemently refused to try and get my permit. I was too distractible; I still AM too destractible, and the idea of getting behind a car and resulting in someone's death is mortifying to me. So instead, I was forced to drag a positively ancient bike out from behind the old shed, and see if it still worked.

To my incredulity, it did! Well it made a few weird sounds at first, and anytime I sat on the cushion it made a sound that heavily implied I absolutely did not want to look through it's foam. But it functioned, and it became the tool through which I could more easily spread my particular brand of terror.

At least that's what I thought. See, right as you get out of my neighborhood, going in the direction most easily accessible to me, there's a large, open intersection. I knew that I could technically ride alongside the cars, but an immense amount of trepidation and uncertainty stopped me from fully placing myself upon the road. So instead I used the sidewalk, and drove down to the point that I could use to cross.

If you're from America, you know just how terrifying it can be to stand there. It's like an ocean between one point of safety and the next, with great bustling, roaring beasts surrounding you on either side. Needless to say; I have a bit of a fear surrounding cars, but figured my bike would steady me across fast enough that it wouldn't matter.

And the first time? It did. I got across after peddling as fast as I could, and sailed onto the other side with a victory cheer. There were a few weird looks from people that could hear my shout from inside their cars, or behind the window of the local Wendy's. But I didn't care. My newfound freedom was exhilarating.

Things were pretty normal, after that. I kept to the curfew, and made sure the explanations for my doings were vague, but detailed enough to satisfy my parents. I couldn't quite tell you when things changed, but I believe it might have been one particular night.

I was running late, having gathered a friend or two to smash in the window of some old warehouse near the edge of town. As it turns out,  the warehouse still had an active security guard, and we'd scattered. My bike had started groaning about halfway home, but had made the journey. Then, there had been tye traffic light; the one right beside my house.

Not too many cars were still about. The majority having vacated the streets for their outdoor resting spots along the walls of the buildings reserved for people. But some still did speed past, and for some odd reason, my hands felt clammy as I reached up and tapped the button.

Seconds ticked, the world muted as I stared towards the small red man across the road, leaned halfway upon my bike as I was. When he shifted to green, I pushed off onto the street, the serene night air pushing into my hair.

As I peddled, I had the distinct feeling that I wasn't peddling hard enough. My heart kicked up,  and everything became Too Clear as I desperately attempted to reach the other side of the street. Something that felt wholly in vain as I stared towards the slab of concrete, and began to realize that no matter how hard I pushed down on the peddles, no matter how many inches I sailed through, they refused to bring me closer to getting off of the road.

Somehow, just as a car appeared in the early night fog, the spell broke, and I crested the concrete quickly, swerving to the right and practically collapsing from the exertion.

When I finally got home, I made some excuse about my bike acting up,  got a stern look and the typical 'make sure it doesn't happen again'. Sleep came slow as, everytime I closed my eyes, the only thing I could see were cars surrounding me on either side, slowly inching closer.

I stayed in the neighborhood for the next week, but, well; I got restless. There came that need, the desperate desire to do Something. So I rode to a friend's house, and everything was fine. Just like before, it didn't happen until I was coming back.

It was dark, as it had been before; only I wasn't running late, I'd made sure I wasn't. The streets breezed past me, muted in their silence. It wasn't until I was halfway to the intersection that the chain on my bike snapped, and I was left coasting to a halt. I was forced to walk the rest of the way, and made what I thought to be the smart decision, texting my dad a picture of my bike, and preemptively apologizing on being late, if I was. I got a thumbs-up in response, and smiled a bit as I came up to the intersection.

I had not forgotten about what happened last time, but through the quirks of the human mind, I had managed to convince myself it was just a dream. That didn't stop my hand from shaking as I pushed down the black button, and nervously glanced around the road. Seconds ticked, and there was not a single car. The most important part is the utter Lack of cars on the; not in the distance, and certainly not up close, as I watched the little man shift from red to green, and jumped as fast as I could down onto the pavement.

Only, like before, that horrid welling pit of realization welled itself up inside me. The very simple revelation that I Was Not Walking Hard Enough. Not fast enough; there was something about the way that I stepped onto the ground in those moments that was simply, for lack of a better term, wrong.

And then, it crested the horizon. A small black Sudan moving too fast across the street, headed directly towards me. I felt tears well into my eyes, and ditched my car, letting it fall behind me as I desperately attempted to run. But I couldn't. It moved with blistering speed and then... and then I blinked. I blinked and I was met with the most horrid sound I've ever heard.

It was the roaring of ten thousand lions, all stitched together to the point that their sounds began to cascade, began to bleed into one another. I stumbled, bright LED's burning my corneas as I fell onto me knees. Fell to stare towards rubber. Billions of pieces of rubber digging incessantly into the pavement, crushing life too fast for it to even blink.

Somehow in the mess of noise and concealing masses of car-flesh, I managed to find my way to my feet. Tripping over my own toes I ran. Choking on the fumes they excreted, I bolted as hard as I could towards the other side of the road. A side that, with horror growing centerfold deep into my thoughts, I realized had ceased to exist.

Unable to accept this, I started running harder, gasping as the air in my lungs was replaced with exhaust fumes; as my lungs began to rust like a car's pipes. It was then, only then, that the cars began to move faster. Their gyrating bodies slithered against slick, oil-wet pavement, bridging the gap between metal and skin. I felt their hot, porous bodies push into mine, and could've screamed when I felt the metal shove its way into my arm.

Then I woke up. Police cars surrounded the edge of the concrete sidewalk. My vision was blurred, breath coming in short, sharp heaves. There was blood; my blood, doused deep into the cement from a large, horrid gap of flesh on my arm. They didn't believe me when I told them what happened. Nobody believes me when I tell them what happened. 

I haven't crossed a crosswalk since, and I refuse to be behind the wheel. I have a feeling if I ever was, I would get into a wreck. Maybe I'd even become one of those cars, waiting to squeeze the life out of some poor soul that dares to get in the way of the machine.
