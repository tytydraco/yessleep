It took almost a year after [my father attacked me](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/12jqafz/after_work_my_dad_used_to_lie_for_hours_in_the/) before I mustered up the courage to follow him to work. 

I was in 10th grade by then, and growing into a man’s body, nearly six feet tall and big like my dad. Everyone said I should play ball, but my dad told me different:

“You’ve got too much brains for that,” he said. “Don’t waste your time playing kids’ games. Probably just end up limping around anyway, and for what? To get your team a couple extra yards and then get forgotten the next year. I been down that road. Fuck that.”

I wish he could have followed his own advice. In the last year, my dad’s body had continued to break down. In addition to the long baths, he’d often pass out on the couch watch TV, bags of ice strapped to his knees. All weekend, he’d barely summon the energy to make it off the couch and grab a sandwich.

And then one day he came home with his face beaten to a polo, his left eye fully swollen shut. My mother yelled at me and May to go to my rooms, which we did, but of course we still heard everything, at least some bits and pieces.

*“...how’d they let this happen?”* my mom asked. *“They’re not supposed to get your face?”*

*“...be fine… customer got a little carried away. They’ll get charged extra, and we’ll get a big fat check.”*

*“...don’t want a check. We’ve got enough.”*

*“We could always use more. Reggie got college coming up in just a couple of years.”*

May was in tears. She wasn’t much of a hugger, but she held me close right then.

“Why can’t he just get another job?” she asked. 

About a week later, I told my parents I had to leave early for school. It was a lie, of course. I waited around the corner for my dad to come out. Then I followed him as he walked to the BART station. 

I had on an old hoodie I never wore, and I kept a safe distance, hoping my father wouldn't spot me. It was all probably unnecessary. He barely even looked left and right when he got to the cross streets, just put one weary foot in front of the other until he got on the train.

The funny thing was that on that BART car, rattling through the dark tunnel beneath the bay that morning, my dad hardly looked any different than the other riders. They were all baggy-eyed, shuffling wearily, half asleep. The air in the car was rank and stale, and every once in a while I caught a whiff of something that made me gag, but no one else seemed to notice. I supposed they’d gotten used to it.

Soon, we popped up on the other side of the bay in San Francisco. Even though I lived a couple of BART stops away, I’d barely set foot in the city, outside a couple of school field trips. It had always been this glittering place just out of reach, totally inaccessible to an Oakland guy like me.

We got off at Powell, and the wind cut through me as soon as we reached street level. My dad, dressed in an old denim jacket hardly seemed to notice. For a moment, I looked down the glittery facade of Market street. The low sun illuminated the tops of glittering buildings even as the shadows hung at street level, the homeless guys still shivering from the cold night, the neon of the fifty-cent donut shops still bright in the darkness. 

My dad took a quick detour down Fifth before hooking around on Mission. Here, there was no pretense of glamour–just taquerias and porn shops, places selling snow globes with the Golden Gate bridge inside for under a buck.

Finally, my dad reached the back entrance to a building. It looked like some kind of loading dock, where big trucks might back up and unload their massive cargo. Maybe twenty dudes lined up at a side door there, all looking about as tired as my father.

“You in line or what?” asked a little white guy with bleached blonde hair. My father had already gone into the building.

“Yeah,” I said. “That a problem?”

“I’m not trying to start shit,” he said. “I’ll get plenty from them inside. Just want to keep the line moving, you know? You new?”

“Yeah,” I said. 

“Figured. You don’t walk like the rest of them. All slow and shit. You a Level One? I am. But that Level Two money, that’s hard to pass up. Gotta know when to say when, though, right? Those dudes who take it to Level Three, Four, Five, they just never seem right.”

He gestured to an older man a few spots up in line. The ride side of his face was a mess of burn scars, such that his beard didn’t grow there, and he was missing a chunk out of his right ear. His eyes were constantly in motion, like some prey animal surrounded by wolves or lions.

“Yeah,” I said. “Level One.”

At the entryway, a couple of guys in brown uniforms ran a metal detector up and down my body, then patted me down. 

“New?” one asked, and I patted my pockets. He rolled his eyes. “You here for a trial day kid?”

“Yeah,” I said.

“You go left at the first hall for orientation.”

While the rest of the men shuffled off to the right, I followed the signs for the orientation room. Finally, after winding my way through an seemingly endless series of gray halls, I reached a small room containing a handful of stools, their fabric torn, revealing the yellow foam rubber within.

I picked the least damaged stool and took a seat. The stool creaked, and I struggled to get comfortable without making too much noise. Every move I made seemed to fill the place with echoes.

Finally, after a few minutes, a tired-looking woman walked in with a clipboard. 

“You know the drill?” she asked. 

I shook my head.

“You must have heard the gist.”

“Basically,” I said.

“It’s a trial day,” she said. “You’ll either like it or you won’t. If you don’t, we’ll cash you out whenever you can’t take anymore. Otherwise, stick around at the end of the day and we’ll get you set up with payroll and all that.”

It didn’t strike me as odd until later that they hadn’t even asked for ID. I probably could have passed for 18, but they couldn’t have known for sure. Looking back, it strikes me that they were operating under almost zero fear of discovery or retaliation–that they were well enough connected that an accusation from a guy like me would mean nothing.

“You’ll start as a Level One, of course,” she said. “Just stay in your assigned chair and don’t talk back. If you leave your chair or say anything to a guest, you’ll be terminated immediately without pay. Facial expressions are permitted, but you’re encouraged to keep your reactions in check. Our most successful workers let their minds drift elsewhere during work hours. For example, you might focus on your loved ones and the financial benefits that your time here affords them. Or you might simply imagine sitting by a calm beach on a sunny day. The choice is yours.”

After the rest of the orientation, the woman led me down another series of hallways to another room. She opened the door to reveal a few other workers all sitting on benches in the center of a room. 

The room itself was lavishly appointed, with ornate, gilded ceilings and a Persian rug that felt soft and lush underfoot. At the side of the room stood a bar and a buffet table, with well-dressed waiters and barmen readying champagne and oysters.

I took a seat at the bench next to the blonde guy I met in line.

“You ever have champagne?” he asked me, and I shook my head.

“Me neither. Well, sometimes they spit it at you. Not quite the same though, am I right?”

I realized my leg was tapping involuntarily, the nerves of the whole thing starting to hit me. What if they found out I was underage? Were these the kind of people that would kick you out on the street or send you to the dump in a bag? And strangely, I worried about running into my dad. What would he say if he saw me here? What would he do.

A pretty blonde girl in a too-tight cocktail dress peeked in through a set of ornate double doors at the far end of the room. 

“Guests are almost here,” she said. “Bachelor party. One hour.”

“I fucking hate these,” said a fat, redheaded dude a few spots down on the bench. “Daddy’s boys all trying to one up each other. Lousy tippers too.”

“Shut the fuck up, Red,” said the blonde guy. “You’re gonna get us all canned.”

Two minutes later, the bachelor party rolled in. It must have been nine in the morning at that point, so I figure they were at the end of a long night, and they certainly stunk like it. Half of the guys were drunk and stumbling, while the other half were a drink away. The groom himself seemed overwhelmed by the whole spectacle, his mouth agape at the enormous oil paintings decorating the room’s vast walls.

“There they are!” shouted the Best Man. “I’ve been waiting for this all night. You ready?”

The Groom looked a little bewildered.

“I still don’t quite get it,” he said. “What do I say?”

“You say everything! All the things you *can’t* say out there. All the shit you’ve been holding inside your whole life. It’s called catharsis, my man! You finally get to unload.”

The Groom shrugged. 

“You make it sound like I’m mad or something. I’m not. I’ve got nothing I need to say.”

“You just think that because you haven’t tried it yet,” said the Best Man. “Here, check it out.” He hunkered down right next to the redheaded guy and started talking, his breath stinking of liquor and cigarettes.

“You think you deserve to be in this room breathing the same air as me, you ginger piece of shit? If the two of us lived in a better world, I’d drag you down the hall by your fucking red mane and bust your fucking skull with the first rock I came across. Do you realize how bad you stink? Like someone took a shit on the floor of a pharmacy where they’d just spilled a month’s worth of iodine.”

I was shaking hard now, trying not to make eye contact with any of the guys from the bachelor party, but the redhead was stifling a laugh, like he’d heard all this a hundred times, like none of it could touch him.

“Is he allowed to do that?” the Best Man asked the hostess. He was getting angry, pissed that his tirade hadn’t won the reaction he’d imagined.

“The workers are allowed their involuntary reactions, sir,” she said. “I’m terribly sorry, but it’s just not something we can control.”

The Best Man swirled on the redhead, his face suddenly graced with a soulless smile.

“It doesn’t matter,” he said. “Because at the end of this, we’ve got a fucking yaucht waiting in the harbor, and you guys are going home to whatever fucking shithole town you drove in from, back to your moms and your sisters and your daughters, who, by the way, we probably spent half the night fucking for twice as much as you’re getting paid right now. All because you’re too pussy to take some real abuse like the guys a floor up from here.”

Suddenly, he spit in the redhead’s face. The redhead almost got up but instead wrapped his fingers around the seat and let the spit dribble down his forehead and across his nose.

“I’m sorry,” said the hostess. “Spitting is not permitted. You’ll be assessed a small fee at the end of your session.”

The Best Man spit in the redhead’s face again.

“Charge me twice then,” he said.

It went on like that for the next hour. I took my licks, too, but the guys didn’t have much worse to say than the Best Man, and I’d heard plenty just growing up in the neighborhood. I could see why my dad took the job. If you just let it roll off you, it seemed like easy money.

But when I thought a little more, I wondered what it did to a man, soaking that shit in day after day. Each word a little drop, like in water torture, the bruises forming over weeks and years. 

Finally, the session was up. 

“Ten minute break!” announced the hostess after the bachelor party had cleared out. But I wasn’t planning to stick around for another session. I’d seen Level One. Now I needed to check out Level Two, to find out what my dad was really up to every day.

I started heading for the door, the other guys calling after me. But I just ignored them. Something had broken in me, imagining the years my dad had spent in this room, absorbing insult after insult. I couldn’t stay in that place for another minute.

I burst out the door and found myself in a hallway I hadn’t seen before. I followed it around a corner and through another door, emerging into a room with an elevator door at one side. I ran to it, pushing the up arrow.

Once inside, I looked up and down an array of buttons going all the way up to 20. My dad could be anywhere, I realized, but I figured floor two was my best guess. 

That was my big mistake.

I reached level two to find halls painted black, with dim red bulbs barely lighting the way forward. I walked down the dark paths, occasionally passing the white outlines of doors where screams emanated from the other side. From time to time, I heard the buzzing of saws and drills, and the cries of men begging for pain to stop.

I was starting to lose control of my breathing. I should have turned back, but I realized I might not be able to retrace my steps. Somewhere nearby, I heard the loudest scream yet, followed by the soft tink of something small and hard falling to the floor.

Suddenly, a firm hand grabbed me by the arm, pulling me up against the wall.

“How the hell did you get out?” the large man asked, his black eyes reflecting the red bulb burning above us.

“I… I got lost.”

“You sure you belong here?”

“Yeah.”

I was shaking so hard I thought I might fall over. The whole world seemed to be pulsing. But I couldn’t let him see that. I had to push it all down, to pretend I belonged here. 

“Then get in your fucking room if you want your family to get paid,” he said. “Nice teeth like yours, I’m sure they’ll get a nice big check.”

He led me by the arm into one of the nearby rooms, where a dentist chair lay waiting, trays full of shiny tools arrayed on metal trays beside it.

“The client will be in soon,” he said. [“Remember to think of your family.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
