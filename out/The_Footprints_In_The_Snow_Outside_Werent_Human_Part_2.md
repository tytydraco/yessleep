 Hey everyone. So, some pretty major things have happened and I feel as though you all deserve more answers considering I left you all with not much to work with.

I've gotten lots of messages from you guys giving your input or inquiries, however I don't think any of you guys seem to have any more of an idea as to what we are dealing with. Which, personally, only seems to make me more anxious.

I was hoping to not have to bring this to my friends because I didn't want to freak them out. I didn't want to make them think that there is something unexplainable in the area. But I felt there was no other option. Though, I don't know what I was expecting out of them. All they said was that they think I'm having a relapse and to maybe bring this up to my doctor. 

Everyone just seems to think I'm lying.

Which, I guess I can't blame you for. If it was me in your shoes, I wouldn't believe it. If I was the one laying in bed scrolling through reddit and I came across this story, I wouldn't take it seriously. Because there's close to no reason for this to be real. So, I guess I'm dealing with this on my own, and of course any of you that do believe me.

In my previous post, I tried to not jump to too much of a conclusion and say that this is a creepy pasta. Even though I leaned very much towards that, I didn't want to confirm it because I had no proof of that. However over the last several days, it has definitely been proved to me that this is something pulled straight from a horror movie. Not an animal. Not a human. Not a combination, but something completely new - and utterly terrifying. But we will get to all of that later. I'm going to try to take you through the events as they happened…

Before I get into it I want to say a few things now that I was a little afraid to say, or things I just otherwise forgot to mention while I was frazzled previously. The first of them being how large the footprints I saw were. I compared them to the footprints of a bunny, however they were drastically larger. The prints I saw were probably between two and 3 feet.

The next thing I want to cover is when the footprints were below my window. Like I said before, my bedroom is on the second story of my house. There is no way a human for example could see through my window from the ground. So if we are assuming the creature had been looking in my window, we would be dealing with something \~15 feet tall.

Last thing I would like to draw your attention to is when I looked out my window which was completely black. The same night I first posted this story. To me, that means either that thing was looking at me through my window, or it was otherwise obstructing my view of my backyard for whatever reason.

So, now that we have all of that covered, let's get into what you came here for…

Lets pick up where we last left off, shall we?

I was typing the last few letters to my previous post before hitting the button to post it online. I let out a slightly defeated sigh as I turned off my phone and laid my head on my pillow. I never liked asking for help, but at the moment I was desperate. That's when a loud “ding” coming from my phone caught my attention. I picked up my phone and saw that I had received a message from my older brother, Noah.

“Hey, im home from work, the lock on the door froze up. Can you come let me in?”

My face turned into confusion. Noah gets off work at 11:00pm. He came home hours ago. He was in his room, sleeping. I was sure of it.

As I stared at the message another one came up, also from Noah.

“Never mind, I got it.”

Still as confused as ever, I watched the top of my phone screen, awaiting another notification. We had a fancy lock on our doors with a keypad that you would type your password into. The door would unlock and automatically lock again after 2 minutes. However, it also sends a notification to our phones whenever it locks or unlocks for security reasons.

I waited and stared at my phone a little longer, but nothing. I crept out of my bedroom and towards the foyer. I looked out our mostly glass door and saw that no one was outside. I also took note of the fact that I was able to see outside. I made my way over towards my brother's room and put my ear up to his door. I heard him quietly snoring, sleeping far better than I was. I shook my head and made my way back to my room. I opened my curtains again and looked outside. Looked at the stars, looked at the light snowfall, looked at the distant street lights. I groaned out of frustration and put my head in my hands.

I left my curtains open and stared outside until dawn, thinking. That's when the thing that I never wanted to happen, happened. Something that I would not wish upon my worst enemies. 

I began to hear the snow outside make the sound of a familiar crunch - the sound it makes when you walk on it. I lifted up my head in an effort to hear the sound even just a little bit better. I got closer to my window and looked out. I saw something that I feel like I can't explain because of how absurd it was.

It had the body of a humanoid type creature. It was very skinny, I watched its bones shift as it walked. I still don't know how it moved considering there appeared to be no muscle on it. I saw no veins, no tendons, no space that there would be organs, nothing. It was as if it was a walking skeleton.

Its skin appeared very taut. It was as if it was far too tight for its “body.” The color of its skin was somewhere between purple and cyan, except it was very cold and dull, but not pale.

As for its head, I have no other way to explain it than just the shape of a flat screen TV. Large, rectangular, and flat.

It was walking around from the front of the house, right outside my room. It was facing down to the ground and I silently thanked god I couldn't see its face as I watched in terror as it slowly walked towards my neighbors fence.

When it got to the fence, it stood still for a moment and I realized I had been holding my breath for too long and my lungs were burning and screaming at me for air. I shakily sucked in the smallest amount of air, but even that, my body was thankful for.

It started to move again. It reached down to where its knees were and it wrapped its long fingers around it and ripped the bottom part of its leg clean off. I fought off the urge to throw up and forced myself to continue to watch.

It grabbed both ends of the leg and stretched it out like it was rubber. Once it seemed to be happy with it, it placed it down to where it was supposed to be and I was barely able to see its skin seem to melt around it before solidifying again and connecting the two pieces of it. I had to tear my eyes away for a moment as I felt the bile in my stomach rise in my throat, urging to be released.

I turned back to look out the window at it again and saw that it had done the same with its other leg and both of its arms. It seemed to be reattaching its other arm to its shoulder joint.

It extended both of its legs before doing the same with its arms as if it was stretching sore muscles. I watched as its bones popped with a piercing and high pitched noise, similar to a rock falling into a metal bucket. The separate vertebrate of its spine jostled in order starting from the bottom working its way up.

After it was done, it leaned back over again and placed one hand gingerly on the top of my neighbors fence before it followed up by planting one foot on top as well

In one sudden swift movement, it jumped from the fence and latched itself onto the wall right in front of my window. I was face to face with something so horrifying that absolutely nothing or anyone would be able to stare back. I caught a slight glimpse of its face when it initially jumped to me. It had a small circular bump on the bottom center of it which I assume was its mouth. Just above it there were 2 sets of multiple holes resembling nostrils One hole in the middle with probably 8 surrounding holes. Its eyes were far back in its face, they were shiny black orbs, no white to its eyes. They were small, about the size of a human's eyes. They were glossy and seemed to be producing a large amount of pus.

I don't even remember jumping back, but at some point I had ended up on the other side of the room on the floor with my back to a wall, gagging as this thing seemed to stare right through me. I stared in horror as something began to pour from its mouth. A weird orange substance with the occasional streak of silver poured from its mouth. I can only compare it to some sort of oil.

I began to see stars as my vision faded surprisingly fast. I was clawing at the carpet of my floor trying desperately to keep myself grounded and stop myself from fainting. But no matter what I did, my vision eventually went black as I watched the oil pour from it as it tilted its head ever so slightly sideways, almost mocking what my dog had done a few days prior.

I woke up hours later, still on the floor. I looked up and the previous events began to come back to me. The first thing I noticed was a very sharp stabbing pain in the side of my neck. I instinctively put my hand over the pain, expecting to feel some sort of gash, but I didn't. I looked at my hand expecting some trace of blood, but nothing. I was completely unharmed.

I fought to stand up, my body aching with pains probably from being passed out in such a harmful position. I picked up my phone from my desk and took note of the time and date. It was 2pm on January the 18th. It was the same day that I had posted on reddit, and it was only a few hours after I saw that… thing. It sent shivers down my spine and caused tears to well up in my eyes to even think about it. 

I left my room and made sure to take my meds to avoid an oncoming anxiety attack amongst other things.

Noah had already left for work, and luckily Boomer didn't have to go outside. Or at least, he wasn't interested. So I sat down at my desk and turned on my computer. There were no emails from any of my professors, no exams or tests due today, and what was due I was very grateful that I already had done.

It hit me that I hadn't even bothered to look outside. And for obvious reasons, I decided I probably should, as much as I didn't want to. So I took a deep breath and counted to myself from three to zero before looking. There was nothing out of the ordinary, no footprints, no oil smeared on my window, nothing. Just a normal day.

I remembered that I needed to get groceries today, but I was still very unwilling to leave the safety of my house. Especially after what had happened last night. I thanked god for modern technology and ordered groceries to be dropped off at my home, claiming I was sick. A little while later I got a message that said they were waiting for me outside of my door.

I took a deep breath and opened my door, pleased to see all of the items awaiting me. I began picking up the bags and bringing them into my house. However, there was one extra thing I definitely did not want.

After I had cleared away all of the bags, I noticed just outside of my door the footprints of the creature. I trembled and looked around quickly in a panic. Nothing to be seen. I closed and locked the door, trying to open it just to make sure it was locked.

After a few moments to let the shock pass, I eventually began to put the groceries away after confirming all possible entrances to the house were locked. As I was putting everything away, it started to occur to me that maybe the footprints were appearing earlier then they actually happened.

I thought about the footprints I saw outside of my window. They were there before I looked out the window to an obstructed view, yet they weren't there now. I thought about the other prints, the ones leading up to my neighbors fence before stopping. They were from last night, when the creature had leapt from the fence to my window. That's why the prints didn't keep going on the other side of the fence.

My blood ran cold when the realization hit me. I said out loud to myself, standing in my kitchen on wobbly legs “Does that mean… it's going to be at my front door?” 

I almost collapsed on myself when my phone dinged with a notification:

“Front door has been unlocked”

Followed up by the sound of the door opening.

I felt every bit of moisture leave my mouth, causing me to start coughing. My stomach twisted and turned as if I was riding the fastest roller coaster ever. Tears poured from my eyes as my ears rang louder and louder in a deafening silence. Panic attack.

I can't quite remember the next few minutes from there. The next thing I remember is Noah gripping me by my shoulders, holding me up when my body beckoned to fall. It was hard to hear but I was able to make out “come sit on the couch with me.” his voice sounded as if we were both under water. He walked me over to the couch slowly.

As I came back to reality I realized there was no creature anywhere. I was safe, Noah was safe, Boomer was safe. Noah explained to me that he had walked in to find me having a panic attack, so he began to comfort me.

I checked my watch, realizing he isn't supposed to be home from work for hours. I asked him why he was home.

“Something happened at work, and they are desperate,” he got caught up in trying to find the right words to say before continuing. “They need to send me out on a short business trip for about 2 days.” this was quick to catch my attention. I sat up and turned my body towards him, suddenly attacking him with dozens of questions. “I don't know all the details but they want me out as soon as possible, so tomorrow, instead of going to work I'm going to drive for a few hours out of town. They sent me home early today so I could pack and do whatever else I have to do.” he told me. I wasn't able to stop the words from falling from my mouth. “No, I cant be here alone because-” I cut myself off. Don't tell him or he will take you back to the hospital. “Because I'm going to sleepover at my friend's place for her birthday. No one will be here to take care of Boomer.” I said. He thought for a second before he said “I mean, I guess I can take the dog with me. He likes going for drives.” I thought to myself about the results this would have if the creature came while Noah was gone. Maybe it wouldn't be so terrible. Noah and Boomer will be safe, and the creature can take what it wants. “Ok, you should go get packing.”

The rest of that day was pretty uneventful, which I guess I was grateful for. I couldn't decide if I should hope for the creature to come while Noah is here or while he's gone. I spent the rest of the day helping Noah pack, and cooking for us. Noah took the dog outside before we got ready for bed, but I still watched from inside to make sure nothing happened to him.

Eventually nighttime rolled around and I laid in bed, simply exhausted from lack of sleep. I picked up my phone to switch on my alarm. I noticed the clock said 11:28pm. I couldn't help but get goosebumps and became suddenly alert as I remembered the first encounter I had with the creature had taken place around this time. I figured it was best if I just went to sleep. Considering Noah hasn't had any issues with this thing, it was safe to assume it just wanted me. He was safe, and whatever happened to me, happened. I quickly fell asleep due to how tired I was.

I woke up the next morning to the sound of the alarm on my phone going off. I turned it off and mustered the courage to get out of bed so I could say goodbye to Noah and Boomer, knowing that it might be the last time I will. Soon enough they were on their way and I stood in the house all alone watching through the glass door as they got in the car and drove off. 

I didn't know how I wanted to spend these next few days. I was no longer nervous or anxious. It wasn't that I was suicidal, but death just wasn't scary to me. I thought about writing up a note for my brother, but I didn't want him to think I was suicidal or ran away. I don't want to make him think I just left him, so I opted not to. 

I tried to listen to some of my favorite songs to enjoy what could be my last day. I took out my phone and put on my loudest pair of headphones and hit shuffle on my playlist.

“Out ta get me” “Guns N Roses” 

Maybe not today. Skip.

“Dust N Bones” “Guns N Roses”

I skipped, but not before grinning to myself, realizing how many of my favorites were by GNR.

“For Whom The Bells Toll” “Metallica”

I let that one play. And thought about the lyrics.

“Make his fight on the hill in the early day. Constant chill deep inside” 

I spent the rest of that day just thinking about what I was going to do when it did come, because I already made up my mind that it was inevitable. I thought about whether I would just take matters into my own hands, but feared that the creature wouldn't be satisfied and continue its terrorizing. I could just walk into its grasp but I had the same problem. I eventually decided that the only way I could guarantee that it would not come back was if I killed it or otherwise moved it to a place where it couldn't harm people. I thought to myself on how you could kill something you know nothing about and opted for the latter, but couldn't think of such a place.

All I knew was that I wasn't going to make it easy for it to get me.

Sooner than I was prepared for, night time came. I didn't have much of a plan, but I had a few small ones that wouldn't necessarily help. More or less I accepted my defeat, but made sure I didn't just let it get me. I was going to be a sacrifice, or bait to take it where it won't harm anyone ever again.

It was getting later and later and I eventually went to my bedroom and got comfortable in my blankets. Most nights I took off the necklace with moms ashes in it, but tonight, mom was going to be with me. By the time 5am rolled around, I started to think that maybe tonight wasn't the night it was going to come. I continued to stare at the ceiling of my room, gently humming along to the music I was listening to. “Nothing lasts forever, even cold November rain…” I was confused when the song was cut off by a notification. I picked up my phone and read the message from “Maybe: Noah”  “Hey, it's Noah. I had to borrow my coworker's phone. I'm home from work,  the lock on the door froze up. Can you come let me in?” and then “Never mind, I got it.” followed up by a separate notification “Front door has been unlocked”

This was it.

I listened to the creature navigate my home, it made an occasional ticking sound similar to a metronome, or a sound almost like a fire extinguisher. I was hoping that whilst it was checking out another room of the house I would be able to sneak out either the front or back door. It wasn't going to come to my room first because I was the farthest away from the front door. I wasn't super concerned about it spotting me because I assumed it wouldn't be able to out run me, judging by the way it walked previously. 

I listened carefully, judging where it was in the house to find when the best time for me to go would be. And when that time came around, I took a deep breath and squeezed the necklace around my neck gently. I opened the door and it was not long before it made the loudest creaking noise I've ever heard a door make. Very quickly I saw the creature come to inspect the noise. I didn't close the door in time and it spotted me. I cursed and slammed the door shut and locked it, seemingly just in time to prevent the thing from getting to me.

I grabbed a wood plank I had in my room to prepare for this exact situation and wedged it between the door and my desk which was against the wall so it wouldn't be able to open the door. At least not easily. Like I said, I had plans, none of them helpful.

I looked around spastically, having not thought about this previously. My window was the only way out.

It slashed at my door aggressively as I tried desperately to open my window. I pulled and pulled as hard as I could as I felt the adrenaline coursing through me, but even that wasn't enough to unlock the window. I cursed under my breath and turned towards the door just in time to see it bash a hole through the only thing that was separating us. Through the hole I could see it crouched down, far too big to fit in the hallway. It reached its hand through the hole and began to tear away the remainder of the door.

In what felt like 1 second I had made my decision and done it. I took a few steps back and I felt the creature reach through and scratch me on the shoulder and took that as my que to go. I ran towards my window and leapt through it. The creature screeched as I broke through the glass and fell down before landing on the ground, grateful for the snowfall we had a few days ago to help break my fall even the smallest amount. 

I didn't get any substantial injuries from the fall that I noticed, and removed a small shard of glass that was in the side of my neck. Luckily it wasn't a deep cut. I grabbed a glass shard and slipped it into my sock, as it was the only place I knew it wouldn't move that much. At least now I had a suicide pill if it came to that. I stood up and began to run. I wasn't very far when I heard some loud banding noises. I assumed the creature had just gotten through the door and was working to get through the window.

This was my stomping grounds as a child. I knew the area like the back of my hand. As I ran I heard the lyrics from the song from earlier echo in the back of my head. “Make his fight on the hill in the early day. Constant chill deep inside” 

I turned to look at the wooded hill that overlooked my neighborhood. Maybe I will.

I followed a road as far up the hills as it would take me. I got further than I was expecting to, but not as far as I needed to when I heard the creature screech again. I turned to see it spot me and began to run in my direction. Luckily it wasn't as fast as some of the creatures I read stories about, but it was definitely faster than me and far faster then I had expected. I could only pray that I would be able to get away.

I looked behind my shoulder and saw that I had very little time left, and there was definitely no chance I was going to get away. But if I was going to go down, I would take it with me. Praying wasn't going to help me anymore.

I got to the top of the hill and shoved a large rock down towards the creature. It was a rock I was always afraid of because of how unstable it seemed. I threw all of my body weight at it and luckily it was just barely enough to move the rock. I stumbled but caught myself pretty well. The rock slid down the icy road towards the creature and it tried to avoid it but that threw off its balance enough that it slipped and slid down the road. Not very much space, but maybe enough. I needed it to be enough.

I ran into the trees that covered the hill before I neared the line I was never allowed to cross.

As a kid mom always told me to never cross an imaginary line because it started to get close to the cliff that dropped off into the ocean. Of course mom always was with me if I was up here, but once I was old enough to be here on my own, I still had to obey the line.

I gripped my necklace tight in my hands before I said “Mom, I know I promised I would never do it. I'm sorry." I said out loud. I lifted the necklace to my face and planted a delicate kiss on it as a tear ran down my cheek. I heard yet another scream of the creature and turned. “That might be enough space.” I said, and soon enough, I crossed the line.

I got to a tree that was as close to the cliff as possible and began to climb it. The creature caught up and jumped onto the tree, causing it to teeter scarily over the edge and it knocked me off, but luckily I was able to catch myself on a branch. I looked down the cliff side at the rocks falling into the water below as the waves crashed angrily against it. That's when I noticed in the reflection of moms necklace a branch that was perfect for me to get more secure on the tree and continue my climb.

As I neared the top I felt the creature claw at the bottom of my feet and scratch a line down my calf. I screamed as my hand naturally went to grip the opening but I forced it to keep me on the tree. 

I got to the top seconds before the creature did. I took a mere second to look to the sky and admire the sunrise. It's probably the last time I will.  It was perched on a branch just below me and I whistled at it, causing it to look up at me. I stared at it in its cold blacked out eyes and said in the most authoritative voice I could muster “Go on then. Come and get me, you son of a bitch.”

With that it lunged up at me causing the tree to begin to slip off the side of the cliff, just hanging on by the roots buried in the ground. I held onto the tree doing my best to hide from the creature navigating around it. Soon, the action caused the tree to fall down the cliff. Once it was far enough gone I jumped to the land, grabbing onto the ground desperately trying to hang on. 

Luckily the creature had not reacted quick enough and it gave one final screech as it fell down the cliff before eventually hitting the water with a loud splash. 

I clawed my way back onto secure land. I laid my head down on the ground, the snow cold against my burning hot skin despite the cold temperatures. I listened closely to hear if the creature ever resurfaced, but I was confident it had not. The adrenaline began to wear off and I started to feel the pain in my calf more and more. I looked down to see the snow around it had turned a crimson color. I sat up and examined it. Even though I was trained in some aspects of first aid, this was not something I could stop. And I was almost ok with that.

I laid there for a little while staring up at the sky as it turned various warm colors as the sun rose. My vision began to slip and I felt my body become a comforting temperature, as if I was back in Moms arms. My eyelids were heavy and I allowed them to eventually fall closed.

I awoke to the sound of my alarm clock going off. The steady beeping becomes annoying. I went to turn it off but was interrupted by my brother's voice. I was in the hospital. I turned to Noah and saw the dried tears on his face. Soon a few doctors came in and explained some stuff to me.

They said that they were still trying to work out the puzzle, but they told me that someone had broken in and attempted to murder me. I ran and got to the top of the hill. When I pushed the boulder down the hill at the “person” it got the attention of my neighbors and they called in with public disturbance. Upon investigation the police found me severely injured and unconscious. 

A few days went by and once I was healthy enough the police asked me about what had happened. I decided to go along with someone who broke in to kill me, because I figured it was easier then to try to explain to them the story of The Footprints In The Snow.
