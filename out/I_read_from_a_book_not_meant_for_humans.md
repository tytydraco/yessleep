is my confession. I am writing this under a great mental duress. My mind is leaving me. I can feel madness clawing at the edges of my mind. I have read the Cryptomoria and spoken the names of the gods. I will try to do my best to recall how it happened for you but please forgive me if I cannot remember it all.

Firstly, my name. I am Walter P Carlisle. My age is of no consequence. Secondly, and probably most important, I work aboard Norwegian fishing ships, having moved to Norway many years ago with my mother after my father passed away. She wanted to be closer to her sister who had married a Norwegian man she met online. His cousin owns a small fishing business in Hestnes that travels south to the North Sea in search of mackerel, Atlantic cod and crab. It was on one of these voyages that my ordeal began. I will go back to the night it began. Back to the night our vessel sank.

The wave seemed to hang in the air before curling towards us, as if displaying its size and magnificence; "Look at me and tremble, human." When it did break, it took our entire vessel with it, crushing us under its immense power. I don't remember anything after that. The next thing I knew I was waking up, coughing on the shores of some unknown mass of land. There was no sign of my shipmates and I didn’t recognize anything around me. Off in the distance, a mountain loomed high into a thick fog, its surface black and terrible. Seeing no other terrain of note, I began a trek towards it.

About two hours into my trek, the cold stabbing into my very core, I came across a strange sight. A Viking longship stuck out the ground like an angry finger, pointing towards the mountain. Aboard it, perfectly preserved in the ice, were several men in the garb of the Vikings. They were all frozen in moments of terror. One had his arms over his eyes, as if protecting himself from some danger, another was midway through drawing his sword. With a shiver, unrelated to temperature, I pulled my coat closer around myself and carried on.

Closer to the mountain is when the voices started. Quiet at first, just on the edge of perception, then louder. I remember perceiving them as voices, but the words they spoke made no sense. Even though I couldn't understand them I knew they were warning me. "Turn away." Ignoring them, I continued on, drawn by some unknown force to the base of this foreboding mountain. It was like I was in a trance.

I finally reached the base and found an opening, a large door carved into the blackened rock. I approached and ran my fingers over the surface. It was smooth and cold. Fog drifted out and some strange energy invited me in. I crossed the threshold and the temperature dropped sharply. I stood in a massive entryway. The mountain opened up into a chamber, supported by tall columns decorated by strange symbols. I wondered who could’ve built this. I didn't think I could last long in that cold so I pushed on, towards a long corridor at the far end of the chamber. I was so singular in my purpose that its only in hindsight I realize the lit lanterns lighting the way were out of place. Someone must’ve lit them.

I came to a wooden door, covered in the same strange runes and symbols from the columns. I placed my hand on one and it radiated warmth. A warning rushed into my mind. "Turn away!" I recoiled, pulling my hand away. I believe now those runes were protective in nature. Little good they did for the urge to open the door overwhelmed me that I all but kicked it open.

Beyond was a bridge carved from the very mountain. It stretched out over a deep, seemingly bottomless pit. I carefully made my way out onto the bridge, keeping my eyes on the abyss below. I don't know how I knew, but it stared back. The bridge widened out into a platform upon which sat a dais of sorts, carved from the rock. Upon that rock sat a book.

I approached the book. It was bound in leather and embossed with a symbol I didn't recognize. Something about the book almost begged to be opened. It was as if some consciousness knew I was there and was asking me to open the book. I ran a gentle finger over the cover and opened it. A wave of energy pulsed out from it and an almost too human sigh of relief followed. It was then that the pain started. A wave of excruciating heat gripped at my mind. It felt like glass shards were impaling my very thoughts. My eyes scanned the pages and, against my will or understanding, I started to speak the foreign words. Each one sent a fresh wave of pain and dread through me. I had no idea how i knew the words but speak them I did.

A rumbling came up from the pit below. Deep breaths and a grumbling roar. Black tentacles slithered up over the edge, crawling towards me, dripping a disgusting black ooze, like thick ink. A giant mass rose up followed by a vile stench. A large yellow orb turned towards me. It was then that I fainted.

That's all I remember. I woke in hospital. They told me they found my wandering the shore near Hestnes, raving about veiled gods and Dissonant Ones. In my more lucid moments these days, I find myself in possession of knowledge I dare not repeat. It haunts my days and nights and I can bear its weight no longer. I write this in full understanding that at its end I shall find relief. I leave you with these words. Do not seek the book. Do not seek the names of the Dissonant Ones.
