I started visiting my mother more often after my father died, but I never expected him to answer the door.



It took a toll on my mother; she seemed like a shell of herself.



Grief takes a long time to process, I understand that, but seeing her this heartbroken crushed me.



She lives 3 hours away. The drive that day took more than 5 hours.



The weather has been bad the past few days.



When I finally arrived, the deep fog had set in. Her house wasn’t even visible from the driveway.



I knocked on the door. Footsteps echoed in the hall. 



A strong smell of damp earth filled the air.



Someone was walking with a limp. Each step made a wet, mushy sound.



Then the door opened.



A wave of shock ran through my body. I stumbled back and fell onto the grass.



Before me stood my father, staring. His face was devoid of color, skin barely hanging on. His eyes were bloodshot and deep in their sockets. Dirt clung to his tangled hair. He was dressed in his old clothes and slippers.



My thoughts scattered.



How could this be?



I saw his body in the casket at the funeral.



Then my mom came behind him. She saw the terror in my eyes.



“Oh, honey, honey, it’s okay, come here.” 



She tried to pick me up off the ground.



“No, mom, what the fuck is going on. What the fuck is that?”



“Johnny, stop it right now. It’s your father!” 



“Mom, that’s not Dad. Dad’s dead!”



My mom slapped my face.



“You'd better stop that, Johnny. Your father is alive, and he’s right here.”



My father grabbed my mom’s shoulder and tried to flash a smile.



My mom touched his hand and looked back at him with love in her eyes.



“Please, Johnny, this is a blessing from God.”



I stared back at them in bewilderment, my body still shaking with fear.



“Come on inside, Johnny. It’s cold out.”



She said and made her way to the house. My father walked behind her slowly.



I walked back to my car, put the keys in the ignition, and got ready to leave, but what about my mom? What if he hurt her?



I sat there for a minute and then got up and reluctantly followed them inside.



The smell of food in the kitchen masked the smell of damp, dirty air.



Mom made steak and mashed potatoes.



My dad’s favorite.



I couldn’t take my eyes off him.



His hands moved mechanically, devoid of purpose.



“Okay, let’s say a prayer before the meal.”



My dad’s hand reached out to me. I looked at it with disgust.



Mom scolded me with her eyes. I unwillingly reached back and held it.



The hand was cold and damp.



My dad didn’t close his eyes during the prayer; he stared dully ahead.



My appetite was gone. I barely ate, mostly playing with my food.



Dad also didn’t seem too hungry. He cut a piece of steak and tried to eat it, but swiftly spat it back out onto his plate.



“What’s wrong, darling?”



“Hungry…”



“Oh, but why won’t you eat some of your steak, you don’t like it, honey?”



“Hungry!”



He yelled. It made me drop my cutlery.



My mom's eyes widened. I could see the fear in them.



“Your dad is probably just tired, Johnny. I’m gonna take him quickly upstairs, okay?”



“I’m not gonna let you go alone with him, Mom.”



“Johnny, you stop that right now!” She screamed out. “You sit right here, young man. Don’t get up from your food.”



She talked to me like I was a little boy again.



No matter how much I protested, she was determined. 



We agreed that if she didn’t come down in ten minutes, I would go up.



I thought about calling the police, but what would I tell them? That my mother is in a room with her dead husband, who’s come back alive? We would both get institutionalized.



They’d been gone for a few minutes, but it felt like hours. My body was getting restless, legs shaking with anxiety.



The fear rose until I couldn’t take it anymore. I got up from the table and slowly walked up the stairs.



A faint sound echoed through the hall as I climbed the stairs, a wet, crunching noise, like a rake sweeping up muddy autumn leaves



The sound intensified as I got closer to the door; a strange coppery smell wafted from my parents' room.



Upon entering the room, I saw a sight that haunts me to this day.



My mom lay on the bed while my father ate her right arm. The blood was dripping onto the bed, soaking into the sheets, filling the room with a metallic odor.



I let out a scream as my head started spinning.



My father then looked up from his feast with the same dull look he had before, and with the blood of my mother around his mouth and teeth.



My head got lighter until darkness absorbed my mind, and I fainted.



When I came back, my vision was blurred. Mom lay on the bed holding her bleeding arm with deep bite marks, but my father was not next to her anymore.



“Johnny, I’m so happy you came up. Your father has been starving since he came back, and I can’t feed him anymore.”



A sharp pain shot through my left arm.



I turned, and shock ran down my spine.



My father was on all fours, biting down into my arm, eating away my flesh.



I screamed out and punched the top of his head.



My father let out a loud “Ugh” and fell to the ground.



Blood had poured and seeped onto the carpet. The smell of copper made me gag. 



“Johnny, look what you have done to your poor father!”



I tried to talk, yell at my mother, but words wouldn’t leave my mouth. 



She got out of bed and started making her way towards me, anger in her eyes.



I immediately began running down the stairs onto the lawn.



When I managed to calm myself down, I called 911.



The police came to the house. What they found upstairs was my mother crying next to the corpse of my father. He was dressed in his old clothes, and fresh blood was around his mouth, but the body had been dead for weeks.



No one believed my story, and my mother has not talked to me since. 



Edit: I now hear the damp footsteps from the hall.



“Hungry…” is echoing through the hall.



The smell of damp dirt is filling the room.
