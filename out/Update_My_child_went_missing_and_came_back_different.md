Hi again. I posted here before, asking for advice. If you didn’t catch the first one, here’s the short version: my kid went missing for two weeks. When he came back, he was different. Not just little things, but big gaps in his memory, stuff that didn’t add up.

The comments were all over the place. Some agreed with the psychologist—said it was trauma. Others started guessing what might’ve happened to him. Honestly, some of it was hard to read. And a few accused me of seeing things, making it up from stress. Just so we’re clear—I don’t have any mental illness history. That’s not it.

But what meant the most was the people who believed me. Some said maybe what came back wasn’t my son. That hit hard. But weirdly, it also felt real—like maybe they get it. People mentioned changelings, doppelgängers, fae stuff. Sounds crazy until you live it.

One comment stuck with me. Someone said something like,  
“OP, you’re not crazy. My daughter went through the same. Can we meet and talk?”

I messaged him. Turns out he’s about an hour away. We planned to meet while my son stayed with his dad. Yes, I know meeting strangers isn’t smart. But I thought my son’s life might be at risk. I took precautions—public place, pepper spray in my coat.

Let’s call him Fred. He looked older than me, late 40s maybe. Scruffy beard, dark bags under his eyes. If his story’s true, I get why. He was sitting alone, nursing black coffee.

I asked, “Are you \[his username\]?”  
He said, “Are you OP?”

We sat down. Small talk was awkward. Neither of us wanted to waste time. I told him more than I ever did online—things I couldn’t put in a post. He nodded like he’d heard it all before.

Then he pulled out two photos—same little girl. One smiling, one with a blank stare.  
“That was my daughter,” he said, showing the first. “This is what came back.”

At first, they looked like the same kid. Same face shape, same nose, same eyes. But when he pointed out the differences, I started seeing them. His daughter had auburn hair, the kind that looks ginger in certain lighting. In the second photo, the girl’s hair had more brown in it. The freckles were gone. Her face was thinner, more defined. The dimples were deeper. The eyes had the same shape, but not the same color. His daughter had bluish green eyes. The other girl’s were greenish blue. They could have been sisters, maybe even twins, but they weren’t the same girl.

“She went missing in August last year,” Fred said. “And came back in early September. Or at least, something came back. Me and the wife didn’t care at first. She didn’t remember anything. Not our names, not the house, not even her own bedroom. But we were just so happy to have her back.”

He said the first strange thing was when they woke up one night and found her standing over their bed. They started letting her sleep between them. When she had trouble at school, they hired a tutor. When she began drawing weird patterns, they got her a psychologist.

“What was she drawing?” I asked.

“Animals,” he said. “Except they weren’t animals. Not from this world. You ever see a kid draw a dog, but it ends up looking more like a stick bug with a collar? Like that. But these weren’t dogs, or stick bugs. They weren’t anything we could name.”

She started having problems at school. She wasn’t getting along with other kids. They pulled her out and kept her at home. That was when she started staying up all night. “Going nocturnal” he called it. They had to lock the doors and windows or she’d wander outside. She started hurting herself. Not with cuts, but by hitting the floor and walls with her hands until the skin split. His wife quit her job to stay home full-time. They tried everything they could because they loved her so much.

They kept telling themselves she was just hurting and didn’t know how to talk about it. They found another psychologist, because clearly the first one wasn’t helping. But things got worse. She started getting physical with them and other adults. They had to give away their dog because they were scared of what she’d do to it. Then she realized sharp objects hurt more than floors, and her self-harming escalated.

That was when they knew they couldn’t keep going like this. They started looking for a facility that could help, somewhere with 24/7 care. He said it was the hardest decision they ever had to make. They felt like they were giving up, but they were terrified if things kept going the way they were she’d eventually kill herself.

“We were careful with our search,” he said. Most places wouldn’t take kids that young, so they also started looking for jobs and a house nearby, so they could move to be closer. It was a time-consuming process, but they were convinced it would all be worth it in the end.

Fred paused, and then he said something I needed to hear.

“I thought a few times... this couldn’t be my daughter. But I didn’t let myself think like that. I didn’t know how that could even be possible. I just wanted to help her.”

Then he told me about the second time she went away, and this time, it was for good.

“She broke a window,” he said. “I thought it was a mirror at first, but it was the living room window. I ran after her. Into the woods. I wasn’t going to lose her again.”

I asked him if he found her.

“I found her,” he said. “She was standing in a clearing. I called her name. She turned around. That was when I knew. Those weren’t my daughter’s eyes. Then the wind picked up, and a light appeared from above.”

“A light?” I asked.

He nodded. “Bright. Like a spotlight. I thought it might be a helicopter, but it wasn’t making any sound. It was focused right on her. Then she started floating.”

I didn’t say anything. I just sat there.

“It was a UFO,” he said. “It took her. Took the decoy back.”

Maybe there was a time when I would have called him crazy. But not anymore. Not after what I’ve seen.

“I think they take our kids,” Fred said. “For research. And they send down something that looks like them. So no one notices. But when we started figuring it out, they had to take it back. Those things she was drawing... she had seen them. On whatever planet they came from.”

I didn’t say anything for a long time after Fred finished talking. The air between us felt heavy. I just sat there, gripping the edges of my chair like I might float off too if I let go. He didn’t push me to respond. Just stared down into his coffee, like he’d said it all before and didn’t expect anyone to believe him anymore.

But I did. God help me, I did.

“They’re still up there,” he said at last.

His voice was low. Almost reverent.

I blinked. “Up where?”

He glanced toward the window, like he expected to see something out there in the clouds.

“Our kids,” he said. “The real ones. They still have them.”

I froze. Cold, electric under my skin.

“They still have them?” I repeated.

Fred nodded slow. “They didn’t just take them to look. They’re studying them. Studying us through them. They didn’t destroy anything. Just pulled their spirits away and left us with copies.”

I leaned in, ready to fight. “How do we get them back?”

He looked me in the eyes like he’d been waiting for that question.  
“You steal your son’s spirit back.”

I waited for more.

“If you find your son’s soul and put it back in the copy,” he said, “the copy stops being a copy. It becomes him.”

I didn’t blink. I knew I had to listen. It was the only way.

“How?” I asked. “How do I find him?”

He smiled, but not a good smile. One that said, *you’re finally ready.*

“You have to leave your body,” he said. “Astral separation. There’s a realm outside this one. Full of things they don’t want us to see. I can help you get there.”

I felt lightheaded. “How?”

He tapped his coat pocket. “I’ve got the real stuff. The good stuff. Things that open your third eye. Let you see behind the curtain.”

“Like… meditation? Ritual?” I asked.

He snorted. “Psychedelics. LSD. Things that were legal until they scared them. The government cracked down, but some of us still know how to get it.”

My hands gripped the chair arms.

“You want me to take drugs?” I said flat.

“Not drugs,” he said. “Keys. Tools. The only way in.”

But I was already standing. Something flipped in me. The weight of all I’d heard pressed down hard.

“I should go,” I said, halfway to the door.

He shouted after me, “Don’t you want your son back?” Loud enough for people to look.

I didn’t turn.

Got in my car, slammed the door, sat gripping the wheel like it’d hold me together. Hands shaking. I had to remember to breathe.

I was this close to taking drugs from a stranger on Reddit. A guy talking aliens and soul-swapping.

But here I am. Back where I started. Asking for help again.

Because something’s still wrong.

I don’t know what to believe. I don’t think Fred lied.

Something is happening. Something I can’t explain.

And the worst part?

I’m starting to think I’d do anything—anything—to get my real son back.

Please. Help me.
