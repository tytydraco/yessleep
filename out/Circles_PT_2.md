Your life is a culmination of choices. Or so I’ve been told.

I’ve spent the last few days trying to remember my mom’s name, her voice, her face. Memory is such a fragile thing. I still see bits of my childhood through the fog—a spinning busted bicycle wheel next to a bloody broken tooth, a birthday cake with candles emerging through a sea of shadowy faces. Bits and pieces that don’t fit together quite right.

One story sticks out, though. A single buoy in a sea of wreckage.

Growing up, I loved to draw. Not well. Stick figures holding hands next to my idea of a dog. My mom would praise me for it.

“You’re getting so good!”

Then one day, I started drawing circles.

First one. Then two, standing together. Then four circles holding hands. Then five, standing in a line. After that, they got more complex—skin-colored circles forming the shape of a man, green ones for the grass, blue ones for the sky.

My dad found it intriguing.

“Not sure if we’ve got an artist or a mathematician on our hands…”

That summer, I became friends with a boy in the neighborhood—Steven. Always in a baseball jersey, stomping down the street in oversized yellow boots. It hadn’t rained all summer.

I thought he looked funny, so I started throwing things at him. Acorns, mud clumps, glitter, Play-Doh. He threw stuff back. We became friends instantly.

“You like baseball?”

That’s all he ever talked about.

My mom bought me sidewalk chalk and asked if I wanted to make something for Grandma and Grandpa before they arrived. So I got to work.

An intricate whirlpool. Circles and spirals all converging on one single shape in the center.

I spent hours on it. My hands were purple with chalk dust from the elbows down. My face smeared and dirty.

THUNK.

A frozen grape bounced off my forehead.

“OW!”

I spun around. Of course it was Steven.

He was laughing from a tree branch overhead, munching on a handful of frozen grapes.

“That’s payback.”

I scowled, threw my chalk at him. Missed. It exploded into purple powder. Steven started coughing, lost his grip, and tumbled out of the tree with a heavy thump.

I rushed to him. He was on his back, clutching his stomach and swearing between breaths. He’d had the wind knocked out of him. I knew that feeling—I’d fallen off my bunk bed more times than I could count.

“You okay?”

Steven shook his head, eyes fixed on the sky.

“No, I think you gave me asthma.”

“You can’t get asthma. You have to be born with it.”

“I need an inhaler. My cousin up the street has one.”

“Hold on, I might have something.”

I ran inside. Earlier, I’d picked out a small plastic fan from the store to help with the heat. Bonus: it came with candy.

I rushed back, blasted him with cool air. He closed his eyes and let out a deep sigh.

“That’s better.”

He sat up, rubbing his back.

“Jerk.”

“Sorry, I didn’t know you were going to fall.”

“Now I’ll never play baseball again. Not with this injury.”

I shook the fan. A red candy popped out. Another shake. A green one. I took the red.

“You want to see my drawing?”

He scowled at the candy, looked past me, and saw the sprawling purple monstrosity covering the driveway. His expression shifted to something mischievous.

“I’ll ruin it.”

He let out a terrible, cartoonish villain laugh.

“No! Not until Grandma sees it!”

He rushed past me. He was faster than me—he always had been.

He started rubbing his feet across the outer circles, dragging purple dust with every step. Closer to the center.

Then he stopped.

He stood in the exact middle of the spiral, where every line converged.

His face was pale. Paler than when he fell.

He looked at me, eyes wide with something I didn’t recognize. Then turned and sprinted down the street—faster than I’d ever seen him run—until he vanished into the cypress trees, deep into the swamp.

The next morning, I checked the driveway.

The drawing was gone.

Not a trace of purple remained.

Just three words, etched into the concrete with precision:

RIGHT AS RAIN

I never saw Steven again.

Not until the night in the hospital.

A circle is simple. One fluid motion. It symbolizes wholeness. Completion.

I’ve drawn thousands since then. Those early drawings were practice. Preparation for the rite.

Back then, the borders weren’t clear. Now that it’s almost complete, its urgency presses on me.

She’s waiting on the platform, chalk in hand. One last rite before the sun sets.

He’s hungry.

He’s taken so much from me already.

I don’t know if I can give any more.

Zepherine insists I forget. She says to burn it all—to let the flames purge my memory.

But I can’t let go of the past.

They said it was a bad fall. That the night of trivia, I took an e-bike, hit a curb, and cracked my skull. Bled all over some poor family eating caviar at... what was that place? Brine & Bone?

Apparently I was groggy for days. In and out. Mumbling nonsense.

“Yeah, you kept saying a name in your sleep,” Vera said. “Estivan? Sven? Steven?”

She brought a bouquet from the flower shop where she worked. I was back in my apartment. Bandage across half my forehead. Arm in a sling.

I didn’t remember anything after the nightmare.

“That’s so weird,” I said. “I could’ve sworn I was in a car wreck.”

We were eating takeout from Wok & Run. Xavier whipped a noodle across Vera’s face.

“Maybe it’s a 50 First Dates thing,” he said, mouth full. “You lose your memory, I show up with a ukulele, we fall in love, yada yada.”

“Please don’t speak while actively inhaling shrimp,” I said.

He doubled down, stuffing three egg rolls into his mouth.

“What? Sorry, couldn’t hear you.”

We laughed. Except Vera, who looked disgusted.

“Okay, but seriously,” she said. “This Sven guy. Have you been keeping a secret boyfriend from us? Is he Swedish? Scandinavian?”

I sighed, covered my face.

“I wanted to tell you. But he’s so rich. I didn’t know if he could handle meeting you guys.”

Vera leaned in.

“Wait… this whole time?”

I flopped back on the couch.

But underneath the smile, I felt the circle turning.

Vera stood to stretch. Looked at the floor.

“You need a new rug, Clara. This one’s nasty.”

The whole thing felt like a setup. Like I’d been sleepwalking again.

Everyone told me it was the concussion. That I imagined the car crash.

Even the doctor backed that version.

But I couldn’t shake it.

My rug was orange. I bought it because it reminded me of an orange creamsicle.

This rug was green—or maybe brown once—but now looked infected. Sick. Like it had leprosy. All holes and stains.

Later that evening, after everyone left, I rolled it up to throw it out.

A folded sheet of paper slid across the floor.

A police report.

I scanned it like my life depended on it.

Everything matched my version.

It was a car accident.

But I remembered calling an Uber. I remembered checking the ETA.

The report said the car was mine.

That I was alone.

No app history. No driver log.

I don’t even own a car.

As I held the report, something jabbed into my sling.

I set the paper down, found tweezers, and did surgery using my phone flashlight held in my teeth.

After a few minutes, I pulled out the offender.

A thick piece of glass. Streaked in red webbing. Embedded in my arm.

It slipped from the tweezers and landed on the sick green carpet that definitely wasn’t mine.

Zepherine would have answers.

She had to.

---

The next morning, I woke up early.

I had planned to use my SwitchBlade app to retrace the route to the accident. The address was still burned into my head from the police report: 2217 W Harrison. I looked it up again. Three model homes sat clustered together beneath a stretch of overpass. No billboard. No sign. No psychic. Just grainy images from the street view, barely rendered.

Still, I had to see it.

Andre had given me the week off. I made my injuries sound a lot worse than they were. Told him I was having dizzy spells and couldn’t remember the day before yesterday. That last part wasn’t a lie.

Before heading out, I put on my grey Bloc Party hoodie, threw my hood up, and stepped into the city.

The air was thick with sound.

Waves of suits and ties filled the sidewalk, all speaking into Bluetooths like actors reading from the same script. Mergers. Projections. Actionables. It was like a game of corporate telephone, passing phrases down the line until they turned into nonsense.

A garbled liturgy for the modern gods.

I pushed through the crowd, heading east.

The sun warmed my skin. The breeze made the headache behind my eyes throb a little less. As I crossed into the city center, the grey began to lift. Color returned. Neon signs blinked. Pigeons cooed. A man selling flowers shouted at no one.

Still, something felt off. The kind of wrong that doesn't come with sirens or screaming—just a pressure in your teeth. A low hum in your spine.

I boarded the Red Line downtown.

The subway jostled. My wired headphones bounced with the rhythm of the train. I sat beside an elderly woman, probably in her 80s, holding three plastic grocery bags to her chest like sacred offerings. She didn’t look at me. Just stared ahead, eyes half-shut.

I was dozing off when the ad caught my eye.

ALL IT TAKES IS ONE.

It was a fentanyl PSA. One of those haunting overdose campaigns. Black and white photo of a tarp-covered body under the glow of police lights. The kind of ad you ignore until something jumps out.

And something did.

The tarp was slightly folded, just enough to show the pale face underneath.

Blonde. Vacant. Eyes wide open.

Steven.

His mouth slack. His hair damp. A little blood on his cheek.

I felt the breath catch in my throat.

Someone had graffitied over the poster. A black circle drawn over his chest. Underneath, in crude red marker:

MAKE IT RIGHT AS RAIN

---

I stood up without thinking and got off two stops early.

I walked the rest of the way.

I hadn’t thought about Steven in years.

He’d vanished as quickly as he’d appeared. But his absence lived with me.

After he disappeared, I used to ride past his house, peering through the blinds to see if he might still be there. His parents carried on like nothing had happened. His sister grew up an only child. No missing posters. No news alerts. Just gone.

Everyone forgot. Except me.

And part of me always thought it was my fault.

The chalk. The circles. That spiral in my driveway. Why had I been so obsessed?

After he disappeared, I swore off drawing. I never touched sidewalk chalk again.

The dreams began soon after.

Always the same: Dollar General. Purple light. Sliding doors hissing open as heat and rot poured out. A voice whispering from somewhere just out of sight:
It’s hungry. Feed it. And it’ll give them back.

I told myself it was trauma. Just my brain trying to make sense of Steven’s disappearance. A metaphor for grief or guilt.

But what if it wasn’t?

What if it was all connected?

I turned the corner and saw them.

Three model homes, perfectly spaced beneath the overpass. Cookie-cutter corpses. Their plastic siding peeling in long yellowing strips. Front lawns overtaken by crabgrass and crushed soda cans.

One house stood out.

The one on the end.

A red sign was staked into the lawn, slightly askew.
OPEN HOUSE. INQUIRE WITHIN.

The words buzzed against my skin like heat lightning.

Nestled beneath the freeway, the houses looked like horsemen of an architectural apocalypse—reminders of an era the city was trying to bury. No amount of polished glass towers or minimalist condos could hide what was underneath.

These were relics.

If they could talk, I think they’d scream: WE’RE STILL HERE.

Crossing the street felt like playing Frogger. Except every car was a dented 2008 Chevy Impala, and there were no extra lives.

I hesitated on the sidewalk.

Everything in me screamed not to go inside.

The feeling was too familiar.

Like the moment just before a nightmare begins.

But I pushed forward.

The door was stuck. I had to shoulder it open. The frame groaned in protest. The moment the door creaked wide enough to step through, the air shifted.

It didn’t feel like entering a house.

It felt like being swallowed.

The house looked starved.

The wooden beams were bowed and splintered. The carpet was threadbare. Mold bloomed like constellations across the ceiling. Dust swirled in the air, lit by a strange beam of sunlight pouring through a crack in the roof. It felt like stepping into a chapel—one that had been abandoned, but not forgotten.

I stepped onto the creaking floor.

The living room was empty except for one coffee table and a folded sheet of paper on top, printed in red:

COMPLETE THE RITE, LEAVE A TOTEM then all will be illuminated.
Talk soon.
Dutifully Yours,
Maria ”Madam” Zepherine

I hadn’t seen her name written like that before.

It looked… official.

Like she wasn’t just a person, but a position. Something passed down.

That’s when I saw it.

Etched into the drywall behind the couch—precise, measured, at least four feet across—was a circle.

Nearly perfect.

Except the bottom fourth was missing.

Incomplete.

Waiting.

I felt my hand shaking as I reached down.

There was a piece of purple sidewalk chalk lying next to the table leg.

I picked it up.

It felt warm.

I don’t remember deciding to draw. It was like the chalk moved on its own. I just let it. Like I’d always been meant to.

The unease that had been building all morning crested, then broke.

I drew the final arc.

A complete circle.

Everything snapped into place.

Suddenly, it all felt… right. Whole. Complete.

A strange, full-body warmth settled over me. A low, golden ecstasy that filled my bones.

And then the house breathed.

Not a metaphor. A shuttering gasp from the floorboards to the beams. Like it had been holding something in for years.

Then it lurched.

I stumbled sideways as the walls cracked and buckled.

And then—

WHAM.

I gasped for air.

---

Too real.

Too real.

Too real.

My heart thundered. My lungs burned. I grabbed at my chest and stared down.

No blood.

No chalk.

I was in a car.

Back seat of a fairly new Honda Civic. The interior smelled like fake coconut. A plastic cactus swayed on the dash.

A woman glanced at me from the driver’s seat. Her sharp eyes met mine in the mirror. I looked away.

“You alright, dear?” she asked in a soft, scratchy accent. “Everything okay with you?”

She waved her chipped red nails in my direction.

What the hell was happening?

“I’m… sorry. Just a nightmare,” I said.

I caught my reflection in the window. I looked pale. Hollowed out.

The woman chuckled.

“It’s alright. Nightmares are only memories you’ve forgotten how to forget.”

I blinked at her.

“What’s your name, dear?”

My mouth went dry.

Name. What was my name?

Why couldn’t I remember?

“Vera,” I lied. “It’s Vera.”

She smiled at the road.

“Nice to meet you, Vera. I’m Mariam.”

She paused. Then turned her head, ever so slightly.

“But you can call me Madam Zepherine.”

Her voice was calm. Like she’d said it a thousand times before.

“We have much to discuss.”
