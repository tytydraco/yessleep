Tis The Season To Spread Holiday Cheer And What Better Way Than To Tell The Wonderful Story Of The Grinch So Snuggle Up Tight Dear Children As I Tell You The Story Of A Small Town Called Whoville.

\*==================================================================================\*

Once upon a time there was a town called whoville the home of The Who’s who celebrated Christmas better than anyone around they hanged sugar plumbs on they’re happy who wreaths and spread Christmas delight for all to see yes ask any who who liked christmas a lot that the spirit of the season was in they’re hearts….

But that was a long time ago now now adays there isn’t much Christmas cheer in whoville…not anymore Santa dosent stop there anymore because he’s afraid of the thing that lives in the cave high up in the high high ranges of the evil mountains surrounding the town Where a dastardly malicious wind blows so high and where a horrible creature lurks about.

They call him the grinch but this time they know the reason he’s a demon sent straight from hell his greenish hair mangy and slimy with just a hint a of rotten garbage he’s grenchy grinch grin all malicious showing off his sharp teeth as sharp as a shark his eyes glow a deep coal red and his cave so dreary and full of dispair with no sign of Christmas anywhere.

His horrid hell hound companion named max no hair on its body just black

No this creature is nothing to be merry about infact this time ayear he usually wakes up

The grinch you see isn’t like us he sleeps during the year and only stirs about when the whipperwinds whip high above the who town and the sound of snow rustles about then the grinch wakes up to play.

During that time late at night you can hear a horrible scream echoing about the mountains of whoville the grinch letting the whoovillians know that he’s about.

The people of whoville down below lock they’re doors and keep children in as the grinch comes to town and takes them to his cave to feast of on they’re skin the only thing left of them is they’re screams of “NO PLEASE NO NOOOOOO AAAAAAAAAAA!” As theyre skin is removed to make horrific bodysuits and they’re innerds removed to make a feast befitting of such a thing.

Yes Who’s know not to go out there in the darkened streets all dreary and bare all the street lights and shops shutdown and the houses closed up for the night and missing persons posters litter the streets full of those few unlucky whos who were outside when the grinch came calling for the night and among the missing children who were caught out in the night.

Among Those children missing from theyre who parents is one little Cindy Lou who who was no more than two she told her parents the grinch was just misunderstood and needed some Christmas cheer to lift his sour face.

But her parents knew better they told her “Cindy Grinch Is A Animal Who Will Hurt You You Can’t Go Out At Night Especially Not During This Time Of Season.”

But Cindy refused to listen and went out to climb to the tip top of mount crumpet or as The Who’s called it grinch mountain she climbed to the top of the mountain the brave Cindy Lou.

Finally at the top she found a cave it was littered with bones and the smell of decay she was a little frightened at the sight but was still determined she crept closer and closer to the cave enterance she heard something and turned around only to see nothing there.

But little did she know that the grinch knew she was there he reached his bloody clawed hands out of the cafe grabbing onto Cindy’s legs and pulling her swiftly into the cave as she dropped her scarf at the cave.

Down in whoville her parents had the door cracked as faint screaming of a little girl echoed about her dad shook his head in sadness knowing she didn’t hed his warnings not to go there.

”Daddy!”

“Yes?”

“That was scary I Don’t Want To Listen Anymore”

“Its Okay It’s Just A Story”

The Dad Closed The Book And Put It Back On The Shelf As Snow Starts To Fall In A Little Who Town Far Away From The Horrors Of The Grinches Grinchy Deeds.
