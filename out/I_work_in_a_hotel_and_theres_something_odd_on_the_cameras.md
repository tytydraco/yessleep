My name is Andrew, I’ve only worked here a few months, and one of the first things they taught me was to always keep my eyes on the cameras. You never know when something is going to pop up that you need to take notes on. Most of the time there’s nothing interesting, just people running to the pool, or getting ice, running to the gas station next door, or just leaving to go to the Applebees. Dollarita’s were back when I started so that’s where most people were. The first month flew by, simple easy, we don’t have a very large hotel, only 4 floors, and like 60 rooms. When I started, we had a lot of stay overs, and a couple of university teams. Essentially, only ever about 30 people in the hotel at a time. We also have a lot construction crews that stay with us while they work on site. 

Most of the crews that stay are really cool guys. Your average dude bros, drinking beer smoking cigs and shooting the shit. At this point the hotel is really slow, it’s after Christmas so everyone is either home or at a different work site, so they aren’t staying with us. The hotel is quiet, dark, and cold. The breathing kind of cold, the sort that comes and goes, filling you with warmth in a kind of exhale, and then inhaling the warmth right out of your body. It’s the beginning of January, so I get that it’s cold. It hasn’t been higher than 35 for the last 2 weeks, a lot of people wanting to come and stay just to avoid the cold. So, my eyes are on the cameras like glue to make sure no one is up to anything nefarious. 

Week 1. We only have 7 check ins today so a pretty boring 8 hours. All of them are prepaid and the paperwork is all done. So, easy. I fill up my water bottle, and I sit down with my Jersey Mikes sub. Can’t resist the Danny DeVito sponsorship. As I’m eating, I look up at the camera screen, here comes a lady with a small Shih Tzu. We don’t allow pets at the hotel, so I get up to go talk to her, leaving my sandwich behind. As she enters, I stop her. 

 

“Ma’am I’m sorry but we don’t allow pets in the hotel, do you have a reservation?”

“I do, I’m a diamond member, I think we can let it slide.”

“No ma’am I don’t think we can let it slide, what’s the name on the reservation?”

“Margaret Thompson. I think my husband made the reservation.”  
  


Her husband had made the reservation, and he was coming in right behind her. I look up and I tell her I’m sorry, we don’t allow pets, you’ll have to find a new hotel. I won’t bore you with the lengthy dialogue, suffice to say she’s a Karen bitch, and she’s not staying at this hotel. After about 20 minutes of fighting her, I make my way back to my sandwich. I get two bites in and here we go again, the phone rings. I hop up and run to the phone and answer, it’s another worker needed a block of rooms. We’re pretty empty so I get it done no problem. I’m on the phone with him long enough that I need to make my way over to check the pool. Inhale. A sharp and bitter cold rushes up my spine and stabs into my body. I don’t know if it’s just the shock of the temperature change or because of something real but I feel like I’m being watched. I grab the hotel master key and run to the pool. Between the hot tub and the pool, the room is humid and warm, constantly sits at around 75. One of the few rooms where sound exists, if not only because of the echo. You can hear everything in there, as I walk around and check the chairs for towels, I can hear my heartbeat. Fast and anxious, trying to warm myself from the cold shock. I finish up and brace myself before walking into the hall. I sing a loud high note, I like to hear it bounce off the walls and the water.

I walk down the hall a bit to the fitness center. A simple room with basic equipment, a small trash can that the guests can throw their towels in. I walk in, check the can, walk out. As I walk out and enter in hall, I hear the familiar beat of heart. I stop, I’m not in the pool where did that come from? I chalk it up to just a trick of the mind and go back to the desk, I have a sandwich to finish. 

The rest of the check in’s go off without a hitch. Everyone gets in and there are no issues. I change the channel from The 700 Club to AMC, they’re playing The Green Mile. It plays at least once a day, but I don’t mind that movie can make me cry every single time. “Please boss, don’t put that thing over my face, don’t put me in the dark. I’s afraid of the dark.” Niagara Falls every time. I sit in the chair and scroll on my phone until the end of my shift. I take little notes, as there wasn’t much that happened. I walk out of the office, and I make my way to the door, and I stop. Exhale, my goosebumps fade, my hair lays flat, and my heart slows. 

I arrive the next day, 15 check ins today. Mostly people still here from Christmas vacation. A pretty nice day, I stay good and busy. Between the phone calls and the check ins I have very little time to sit down until around 10:30. I finally have the chance to really get a good look at the cameras. My eyes must be playing tricks on me. Who is that on the third floor. There’s a man standing there at the far end of the hall almost sitting on the AC unit by the window. I run to check our in-house guests to see who is up on the third floor. There’s about five people up there, two families and three single people. Ok maybe it’s just someone who needed some space from family or just wanted out of their room for a bit. I sit and stare for at least 20 minutes. An unmoving man, just standing there, no expression, not playing on his phone, or anything just glaring straight back at the camera. The desk bell dings ripping me back out of the world of the unmoving man. I look up at the clock, 10:31.

The next day I come in, nothing too crazy only a few check ins so a chill and quiet night. I play on my phone for the most part and chat with some of the workers who stay here. As the day winds on it hits about 7:00 time to change the coffee. I grab the pots and march over to the kitchen. As I pour out the pots, I hear a faint singing from the second floor. I walk up to the second floor and check both ends of the hall. Nothing, but I still hear the singing, it’s above me again. I debate if I should let it slide or chase it. While it’s not too late many of the workers work night shift so they sleep until 11.  I head up in the elevator to tell them to knock it off and go to bed, and when I get there, everything is silent. It’s cold and humid, there’s a kind fog rolling across the floor. That can’t be right. The whole floor is dead silent. Not a sound from the AC units or from any of the 5 people staying on the floor. I step off the elevator and the chill shoots up my spine. Inhale. I can feel the air pulling against my shins. As the air finally slows to a stop a feel a mist roll over my eyes. I still don’t remember everything that happened on the third floor that day, and even writing about it now my head hurts trying to remember it. All I know is the mist came and then suddenly I was back in the kitchen pouring the coffee pots out again. 

The singing was gone, all that was left was the wind outside and the soft hum of the florescent lights. I finish the coffee and come back to the front desk. I go down my list to check everything off. Out of the corner of my eye I see some movement on the camera. He’s back. But only for a moment and he walks off into the stairwell. I quickly switch the camera to see where he went. I glimpse him running down the stairs as fast as he can, past the second floor. I run out to catch him on the first floor. I run down to the entrance and nothing, nothing outside either. I turn around and I see him, on the complete other side of the hotel than where he was. His face on the other side of the door, not glaring anymore, smiling. Beaming even. I stand there holding his gaze for as long as I can reasonably explain to my boss. When I move to get back to the front desk his face darts away from the door. For the rest of my shift, I can’t bring myself to look at the cameras. I can’t convince myself to look, no matter how many things I see move or shift, how many shadows I see dart across. 

Thankfully the weekend passes and nothing else happens. The cameras are clear, not a single shape, shadow, person, no singing. I make it to Monday. I sit down in my boss’s office I must ask her about this. 

“Hey Tracy, got a question for you!”

“Ok, shoot.”

“So, I’ve been seeing some weird stuff on the cameras. Do you know if the hotel is haunted or am I just crazy?”

“You’re crazy”

“Really?”

“I’ve been working here in this hotel for 20 years and not once in that time I have never heard anyone, myself included talk about ghosts in this hotel. You’re crazy.”

“That’s not possible there’s no way that no one has ever said anything about ghosts this is a hotel! At the very least they’d make some connection to The Shining”

“I’m telling you right now, there’s no ghosts here. If you’re seeing something in the cameras maybe go to a therapist.”

“You’re probably right, I mean if no one else has ever mentioned it.”

I just shrugged defeated and looked at her. She looked back her eyes darting from me to the camera screen. Until she finally sighs and gets up to leave. She’d only been here an hour. After that she never spent much time around me at work. If I worked a morning shift, she would come in until the very end, and If I worked afternoon, she’d leave 20 minutes before I’d get there. I asked my coworker about it one day. They wouldn’t answer, just said that Tracy didn’t talk to them much anymore.
