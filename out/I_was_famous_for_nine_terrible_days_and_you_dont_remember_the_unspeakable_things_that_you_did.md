**Part I** - [Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1eyjp05/i_was_famous_for_nine_terrible_days_and_you_dont/)

Be grateful for that.

I don’t know what fills your muddy memory slot from Wednesday 1st November to Friday 10th November. Perhaps, if you reflect on those days, you feel an ache in your skull. The mash of your grey matter in a hydraulic press. There’s a small part of you that knows, isn’t there? You’ve forgotten something.

Try not to remember. I don’t want to think about what would happen to you.

Nine months later, there’s no mention of me anywhere. No articles. No recordings from concerts. I deleted my entire discography and online presence, just to be sure, but that was an unnecessary cherry on top. I didn’t just rewrite folk’s memories, but existence itself. And I did it to save myself. To save you.

I was a famous artist known as Fen, which is my given name. Quite a unique one, I was told by numerous record labels over the years. However, success eluded me. Still, I kept myself grounded. By mid-2023, I was quite proud of the three-hundred hardcore fans I’d gained on YouTube. It’s a shame that anything under a million subscribers equates to zero in the detached eyes of music executives.

“Wow,” Mr Lewis said, removing the bulky headphones. “The guitar. The songwriting. Your voice? Mind-blowing. You have a rare ability to write captivating earworms, Fen. I’ll be hearing that melody in my head for days…”

There was always that lingering *but*.

“It’s just not viable right now,” The producer finished, delivering the oh-so-familiar death blow. “You’re fantastic, Fen. But there are a million fantastic musicians in the world. We don’t have the resources to sign them all.”

I stifled a groan. “What do I need to do to stand out? I’m awful at marketing. But the few fans I have found all sing my praises. They say I deserve to be bigger.”

“And I agree with them,” Mr Lewis nodded. “But the world doesn’t work that way, Fen. Talent is only part of the equation. Why was Billie Eilish more successful than Cindy Koole?”

“Cindy Koole?” I repeated.

“Exactly,” The producer smugly replied. “Money. Marketing. Connections. Luck. You need at least one of them.”

I stood, ego bruised and tongue still. I accepted the brutality of business, but I’d reached the end of the road. Twenty-nine years old with nothing to show for it. In such a youthful industry, I might as well have been ninety-nine years old. I was past my sell-by date, but it had been a fun run. Ten years of chasing a pipe dream. I hadn’t devoted my full time and attention to music, admittedly, because I was holding down a part-time job to pay the bills. Nevertheless, it hadn’t happened, and it wasn’t ever going to happen.

Now, all of that is true in a natural timeline. Fen gives up. Joins the adult world. But something very unnatural happened as I was exiting the record label’s lobby.

“Did he crush you?” A man asked.

I stopped in front of the revolving doors. I should’ve kept moving, wallowing in the humiliation and daydreaming of my future. My plan to become an adult with a real job. I was going to ditch the part-time gig at the theatre’s concession stand, instead putting my degree to good use and becoming a business analyst. I was going to turn my body and soul to pulp, as every good grown-up should. I’d kept the party going as long as possible. That was more than most people could say.

Besides, I was thrilled, to some degree, at the prospect of making my parents and the taxman proud.

*Don’t write me off just yet, Mum and Dad. I work at Hoity-Toity Name & Smithson. Say ta-ra to the hippie garbs and electric guitar. I now study only the sacred capitalistic scripture. I’m a CBAP chap. I dabble in cut-over tasks. Implementations. Burndown charts. You don’t know what any of that means, but you don’t care, do you? It sounds mighty important. Sounds mighty mature. And that’s enough. On my gravestone, they’ll write:*

***Fen Davies 1995-2045***

***That boy knew how to analyse a thing or two. Died of a heart attack at fifty, but, my word, he was a simple fellow. Never kept us awake with worry at night. Never did anything of note, in fact.***

*I hear you now, Mum.*

*“Hallelujah, Fen is normal. That was a close one. But it’s our own fault, of course. We never should have given him such an oddball name. You were right, darling. We should’ve called him Steve.”*

I was lost in that self-deprecating stream of thought, but the stranger in the lobby distracted me from my inner spiral. It didn’t take much, of course, to distract me from such a drab plan for my future. I’m usually too introverted to engage with strangers, but I made the terrible mistake of turning to face the man in the lobby.

“Pardon?” I asked.

The gentleman was small. He’d made himself small by hunching over in the squeaking armchair by the doors. He was a middle-aged fellow with a receding hairline and eyes to match. That is the best way to describe his brown, faded pupils, which were rolling towards the back of his head. Still visible, but lost to another world. The brown specks threatened to disappear beyond his upper eyelids.

“You’ve just seen Mr Lewis, I assume?” He enquired.

I nodded. “Yes.”

The man huffed. “Tosspot.”

I lightly chortled at an insult I hadn’t heard since Will Kenny stole Jim Brennan’s bag of Skittles in Year Two. The hunching fellow then straightened his back a little, before waving a hand apologetically.

“Not you,” He said. “Him.”

“Right,” I smiled, eyeing the revolving doors in my peripheral vision. “I’ve got to go now, so–”

“– Where?” The man interrupted. “To meet another dismissive producer or uninterested manager?”

I sighed, massaging my upper nose with a thumb and forefinger. “Do you work here?”

He shook his head. “No. The name’s Heath Brandon.”

“Mine’s Fen,” I answered.

“Be honest. You don’t really have anywhere to be right now, do you, Fen?” Heath asked, patting the seat of the armchair beside his.

I frowned. “I have a shift at the theatre.”

“When?” Heath queried.

“In about an hour,” I said, wondering why I was answering truthfully.

“Perfect,” The man replied, patting the seat beside him again.

I obliged, but I chose to face the lobby ahead, rather than his unnerving eyes. As I settled into the armchair, I told myself that it wouldn’t hurt to network a little. I told myself that Heath Brandon must have some link to the music industry, given that he was sitting in this lobby. I needed to put myself out there, after all.

In truth, I didn’t believe any of that. There was no good reason for sitting beside Heath Brandon. Every instinct begged me to get up and leave.

“Won’t we get in trouble for loitering here?” I asked, nodding at the receptionist.

“None of them notice a thing,” Heath said.

I paused, searching for a good response, but I had none. The strange man was right. The receptionist hadn’t even clocked me at the desk earlier. Not until I’d asked for assistance two or three times. Her disdain was immeasurable, likely due to the continuous influx of hopeful musicians who strolled through those ever-revolving doors. I was simply a forgettable face in the mix. And I didn’t realise that was a privilege.

“Who are you, Heath?” I asked. “You don’t work here, so why are you sitting in this lobby?”

“Do I not look like a rockstar to you, Fen?” The man asked, smiling in a way neither warm nor cold.

It was a smile that didn’t communicate anything at all.

I weakly returned the expression. “Sorry. Are you waiting to see someone?”

Heath let out a chuckle closer to a stuttering engine than a display of human emotion.

“Fen,” He started. “I’m always waiting to see someone. Someone like you.”

My heart lifted a little, and I wondered whether I’d been right. I thought, for a moment, that I’d been wise to ignore my gut feeling because Heath had been a worthwhile network connection all along. It seemed that I’d made the right decision for once in my non-existent music career.

“What do you mean?” I asked nonchalantly.

“I’ve not heard any of your music,” Heath replied. “But I know it’s good.”

I rolled my eyes. “How? Do I have the look? The ‘star factor’?”

“Not at all,” The man said with unintentional severity.

I smirked. “Oh. Thanks.”

“Nobody’s born with that star quality, Fen,” Heath explained. “But millions of people are born with talent. Mr Lewis gave you that spiel, didn’t he? He’ll have used it to pave over the cracks of his rather cruel rejection.”

I nodded.

“Well, the man isn’t wrong,” He continued. “You are one of those talented people. I see it in your eyes. You’re tired, Fen. Tired of being overlooked. And you’re not delusional. My gut is never wrong. Like so many before you, you’re on the verge of greatness.”

“I’ve heard this spiel before too, I’m afraid,” I sighed. “Every famous artist was once a nobody.”

“And how do you become a somebody? That’s what you want to know, isn’t it?” Heath asked.

“Do you have some magical answer?” I laughed.

“Yes,” He answered with absolute sincerity. “I can make you famous, but you must understand what ‘fame’ entails.”

I grimaced, suddenly suspecting that I’d wasted a few minutes of my day. Heath became, to my eyes, a mentally unwell stranger who’d wandered into the record label’s main lobby area. One who’d gone unnoticed by the disengaged receptionist. I felt my cheeks redden as I started to believe that I’d been suckered. I was so desperate for stardom that anybody could have sold me the moon.

“You don’t believe me,” Heath said in response to my long silence. “You think I must be some crackpot.”

I shrugged. “If the shoe fits.”

“What is fame if not a stroke of magic?” He asked. “Mr Lewis puts it down to money, marketing, connections, or luck. Maybe a combination of all four. But he’s wrong. It’s magic.”

I was disconcerted by the man’s verbatim echo of Mr Lewis, but the quick-moving conversation derailed my train of thought.

“Listen,” I started. “This has been lovely, but–”

“– But what?” Heath interjected, a hint of aggression in his tone.

And for the first time since meeting him, the mysterious man’s disposition shifted from harmless to threatening. For the first time, I felt something other than embarrassment. I was afraid.

“I really have to go,” I said unsteadily.

“And sit in your car for…” Heath paused to check his watch. “… fifty-five minutes? Then you’ll stand behind the Palace Theatre’s concession stand for several hours. You’ll overhear the performances of actors and singers who’ve found their dreams. Meanwhile, you’ll shovel pick-and-mix into grotty containers. Does that sound right?”

“You said you don’t work here,” I bluntly replied, starting to feel irritated. “I don’t see how you’d be able to help me.”

“Oh, I can help you. But I’m not going to show you what lies behind the curtain,” Heath said, suddenly slipping a clipboard from the shadowy depths of his fuzzy jacket. “If you want success, sign here.”

I took the clipboard from the man, then read the oddly-brief and oddly-worded document clipped to it.

*I, as the “Artist”, hereby sign myself to Red & Tinny Records, which shall hereinafter be referenced as RTR.*

*I hereby agree that this contract affords RTR the right to 50% of all profits, monetary and otherwise, from the Artist’s career.*

*I accept that RTR will promote the Artist to attain ever-growing success, and I accept the result of that success.*

*By signing below, I agree to the terms and conditions of this document.*

*Artist Name: \_\_\_\_*

*Date: \_\_\_\_*

“Don’t sign just yet,” Heath said.

“I wasn’t planning on doing so,” I whispered, heart pumping at the fact that a record label merely wanted me. “Why didn’t you just tell me that you work for a rival company? I’m surprised Mr Lewis hasn’t cottoned onto your game and kicked you out of here.”

“He doesn’t notice,” The man said, repeating his earlier line with a little more ice. “Let’s talk about the legality of the contract. Let’s talk about fame and its dangers.”

“I know,” I said. “It corrupts the mind. Inflates the ego.”

“No,” Heath shook his head. “That isn’t what I want to discuss. You will stay grounded, Fen. You’re a good man.”

“You don’t even know me,” I pointed out. “But thank you.”

“And you do not know me,” He coldly replied. “But I know this industry. There is always a price. You should consider that before signing. When it comes to the perils of fame, think less about yourself and more about those who follow you.”

I smiled more broadly. “That’s the appeal. Right now, I only have a handful of followers, and their comments warm my heart. Reaching a wider audience and amplifying that influx of positivity? I’m excited about that prospect.”

Heath nodded. “Music is a powerful thing. As is a book. As is a film. As is any work of art that might bring a person fame and fortune.”

“But…?” I started, sensing the lingering word with which I had become well-accustomed.

“You want to reach the masses,” The man said. “You want not only to create music, but for it to be heard and appreciated. For thousands upon thousands of people to tell you that you have changed their lives. That’ll fix you, won’t it, Fen? That’ll make you feel like more than a drop in a large pool.”

My face whitened as Heath’s scanning eyes passed over my brain, tugging at the strands of my innermost insecurities. The crooked man knocked and bruised a few nerves as he searched.

“But you won’t be a person to them,” Heath warned, pupils nearly vanishing as they rolled closer to the edges of his eyelids. “They won’t see Fen, the young man who just wanted the world to hear his art. They’ll see something that belongs to them. The one who gifts songs that speak to their experiences. Love, loss, and the passage of time. Whatever words you spill into their ears will not tell the tales of Fen Davies, but the tales of his followers.”

Later, I would feel a pang of fear, wondering how Heath had known my surname. But later than that, following the most hellish week of my life, I would not wonder at all. And it would not terrify me to the same extent as the other happenings.

Whilst sitting in the studio’s lobby, I was focusing only on the glistening contract in my lap. It outshone Heath’s glaring words of caution. My dream was about to come true. To be heard was all I’d ever wanted. It wasn’t about the money. My parents would have fainted at such an admission, but I was fine with the theatre’s generous offering of minimum wage. It was always about the fame. I wanted to be on a stage. I wanted thousands of people to sing my songs. And I wanted to sign that contract without even consulting a lawyer.

But I managed to restrain myself.

“May I have a digital version of this?” I asked. “I want to send it to my friend. He doesn’t work in the music industry, but he’s a legal expert. I think–”

“– This is time-sensitive, Fen,” Heath interjected, the veins at the bottom of his eyeballs starting to peek at me.

He’s clearly been bumping something, I thought. But I don’t give a shit. If a manager needs to be as high as a kite to even consider signing me, then let the blow flow.

“You’re really going to rush me?” I asked.

The man paused, clearly searching for a lie. “I’m old-fashioned, Fen. I’ve never been one for technology. And the industry is fast-moving. You know this.”

“Technology’s a big part of the modern music industry,” I pointed out.

“The old ways still work,” Heath grumbled.

I sighed. “Let me give my friend a call, at least. This is a very brief contract. I’ll read it to him.”

Heath was about to say something, but he reconsidered. “Fine.”

With trembling fingers, I hurriedly dialled Paul, my former bandmate and dear friend. I was thankful that he picked up. I don’t know what I would’ve done otherwise.

That’s a lie, of course. I would’ve signed the contract without any legal consultation at all.

“Hey, Fenny,” Paul answered. “What’s up? I’m about to head into a meeting.”

“You’re having one right now,” I chuckled. “Let me read you a contract. It’ll only take a minute.”

“I beg your pardon?” My friend asked. “A contract for what?”

I read the document aloud, hoping that it would serve as both an explanation and a pleasant surprise for one of my closest friends. His reaction was the one I’d expected.

“Jesus, Fen…” He paused. “You jammy dodger. Well done. At least one of us seized the dream, eh?”

I laughed. “It’s crazy, isn’t it? What do you think?”

He sighed. “I mean, I’m happy that you’ve finally caught the eye of a label, but… Look, this is a strange one. It’s an incredibly short contract. There are so many things this company hasn’t stipulated. Have you even researched Red & Tinny Records?”

“No,” I replied. “It’s sort of a time-sensitive thing.”

“That’s a red flag in itself, Fen,” Paul warned.

“I just want to know whether or not the contract ticks all of the boxes,” I said. “Does anything sound fishy?”

“I’d prefer to see it written down,” Paul said. “*I accept the result of that success.* This is the sentence which sticks out like a sore thumb.”

“From a legal standpoint?” I asked.

“No…” Paul admitted. “But–”

“– Time is ticking, Mr Davies,” Heath warned.

“Is that him?” Paul asked. “Is this guy sitting there and waiting for you to make a decision? You’re being pressured, Fen. I don’t like any of it.”

“Is it a sound contract, Paul?” I asked again.

My friend mumbled something incoherently, but he eventually released a sigh.

“It’s legally dubious, but not necessarily illegal,” He said. “However, you should be alarmed by the very fact that I remember every word of the contract. It shouldn’t…”

“… be that short,” I finished. “I know. But I have to sign it, Paul. You know I do.”

Paul moaned uncomfortably. “I’m not saying any of this as a lawyer, Fen. I’m saying it as your friend. This is one of the least trustworthy contracts I’ve ever come across. The whole thing smells. And I just Googled the name of the label. I didn’t find any mention of–”

“– Technology is noise. We don’t have an online presence,” Heath interrupted, his keen ears having somehow heard my friend’s voice through the receiver. “I think I’d like a decision now, Fen.”

“I’m doing it,” I whispered, hanging up the phone before Paul had another chance to protest.

I knew my friend was right. I’d known it before ringing. Known it the second I locked eyes with the strange man, whose form looked less and less human with every passing moment. But every jolt of dread was counteracted by a fresh surge of endorphins. I kept envisioning my new life. The one I’d been chasing for a decade. And I did what I was always going to do. I scribbled my name and the date on the contract, then I thrust it back into Heath’s hands.

The man smiled, rolled off the edge of the chair, then stood with the hunch in his back seeming to worsen.

“I hope this mends you,” Heath whispered ominously, before passing through the revolving doors.

That very same evening, before I’d done a thing, the growth began. My follower count on each social platform rose into the thousands, driven by some marketing scheme I hadn’t even seen unfold. But I wasn’t complaining. I was happy to let Heath work his magic. Happy to let him keep his secrets, given that there were results on Day 1.

The following morning, I received a thin, brown parcel in the post. Inside was a packaged version of my unofficially released debut album, The Land, which had been collecting dust on SoundCloud for years. The vinyl sleeve depicted a sprawling forest of fir trees which stretched beyond the horizon.

I also found a slip of paper at the bottom of the brown parcel.

*Sign below, Mr Fen Davies, if you grant Red & Tinny Records the authority to officially release your debut album on Friday 3rd November, 2023.*

I signed my name without bothering to call Paul and endure another lecture. I posted the letter immediately, but wondered how it would even arrive in time for Mr Heath Brandon to release my album the following day.

It was only later, upon admiring the mock-up vinyl of my album for a second time, that my opinion started to shift. That the sky-scraping trees took on new life. The artwork was still striking, but it struck me with dread, not wonder. And the longer I eyed the landscape, the more I felt threatened by the watching woodland. The more I imagined, in the darkened recesses of the forest, eyeballs rolling into skulls, yet still somehow seeing me.

I flipped the vinyl sleeve over, not wanting to tarnish this exciting day. The day that I hoped would precede my meteoric rise to fame. I predicted, of course, a modest start. Whatever promotional campaign Heath had planned, I expected my subscriber count on YouTube to reach several thousand. And I was excited for that. I was prepared for that. Nothing more.

But there was much more.

I woke on Friday morning with a heavy, rattling head. A wallet loaded with loose change. The groggy sensation that follows a restless night. Giddy anticipation had kept me fidgeting in bed. And if I’d known that The Land was scheduled for a midnight release, I wouldn’t have slept at all. I would’ve been glued to social media as the unprecedented whirlwind began.

Instead, I unlocked my phone, around ten in the morning, to find a storm that had already been raging for hours.

What the fuck, Fen? I just listened to The Land. I’m sorry for being an arse. If I’d known you were sitting on such a gem, I’d have been screaming at you to sign the contract. You’re incredible. Incredible. Incredible. Incredible.

I beamed happily at the message from Paul, though I was simultaneously irritated that he hadn’t been quite so mesmerised by The Land when I finished it three years earlier. The music was the same. Only my status had changed. Still, that thought quickly drowned in an avalanche of noise. A staggering number eyeballed me from the bottom of my screen. Atop the YouTube app was a red, bloated notification bubble, presenting an integer that seemed to be a glitch.

46,568.

Heart squirming on my tongue, I hurriedly scrambled to check my channel. The notifications were real. I had 3170 subscribers on Thursday evening. By 10:20am on Friday morning, I had 259,679 subscribers. My videos had views in the hundreds of thousands. And the Spotify streaming figures were just as mind-melting.

I received mentions on social media from everyone I knew and nearly everyone I didn’t know. Mr Lewis called me apologetically, begging for me to sign with his label. I declined. I didn’t need him.

My social media accounts had skyrocketed in traction. Even the ones I’d abandoned years earlier. And this was only the beginning. Friday 3rd November, 2023. By the evening of the following Friday, nobody would know my name. I begged for them to forget.

Heath and I only corresponded by post, and there was a frequent stream of letters. Back and forth. I sent each response to the following address:

*RTR Building*

*Eleventh Street*

*Lancashire*

*PR11 PR11*

It is a non-existent place, as you’ll see if you Google the address, but my letters were clearly being delivered because I was receiving responses from Heath.

On Monday morning, I caught the Royal Mail driver at the postbox. I asked him how he’d managed to deliver my letters to a location that did not exist, but the postal worker simply offered a frown. The puzzled man told me that he didn’t recall seeing any letters addressed to such a place. The postcode, he said, obviously did not exist.

There returned that scraping churn in my gut, much like the one I’d felt when Heath Brandon’s pupils spun towards the abyss behind his eyelids. Yet again, however, dopamine drowned my fear. I was thrilled about the idea of my first real gig on Tuesday 7th November. The O2 Ritz in Manchester. An old, well-known venue, but a small one. A good starting spring towards the rather more intimidating concerts.

That was why I was so unprepared for the crowd outside the venue. Fans blocked the road as my chauffeur attempted to safely ferry me towards the side entrance. And the vast majority of these people, I quickly realised, weren’t even in the queue. These were folk who hadn’t managed to gain tickets to a sold-out show. The folk behind my sudden rise to success.

Something baffling dawned on me. The Ritz can house nearly two-thousand people, but I’d already outgrown it. I was scheduled to perform at Wembley Stadium that Friday. Heath had promised great things, but this was beyond all I knew to be possible. It was an unprecedented rate of growth, and this scene made that apparent to me. Whitworth Street West was buried beneath an army. Whatever their goal, that was how the fans appeared to me. Militant. Motivated.

I’d spent the weekend enjoying fame from a distance. And that car ride was my first graze with the outer world as a famous man. Three million subscribers on YouTube after only six days of fame. Seeing those numbers on a screen had been intoxicating, but I hadn’t mentally braced myself to see even a fraction of that number in the flesh. Not digits on my phone, but real people. A hungering, mindless mob surrounding my car and banging eagerly on its metalwork. They were obstructing any potential route from my vehicle to The Ritz.

The gathering was disrupting the flow of traffic, though no authorities seemed to care. Even the staff members in luminous jackets, who should have been dispersing the disrupters or calling the police, were clamouring to peek inside my car. Cupping hands against the tinted panes and scanning me with eyes that offered no insight into their cold thoughts. They were worryingly fixated upon me. The man who had been a nobody to them only a handful of days earlier.

“Are we going to be able to reach the entrance?” I asked Ian, the chauffeur.

When I turned to face him, however, I was horrified to find that the man was already staring at me. Mouth grinning. Eyes on the verge of watering. Throughout the drive, long before we’d even reached Whitworth Street West, I’d viewed him as a poor driver. Speeding and swerving. Nearly colliding with curbs and cars. But I realised I’d simply been avoiding the truth. The truth I’d seen in my peripheral vision.

Ian had been driving terribly because he was repeatedly taking glances at me.

“I’m a huge fan, Fen,” The chauffeur whispered.

I smiled, striving to look at anything but his possessed eyes. I locked onto his smile instead, but those curled lips perturbed me. Much like the members of the mob who’d surrounded us, the driver was hungry. Dribble had trickled from his lips and coagulated in his facial hair. A sign that, as I’d feared, he’d been eyeing me in this way since the start of the journey.

“Thank you, Ian,” I replied nervously. “Anyway, how am I going to get inside the venue?”

A tear escaped the driver’s left eye, revealing something that told a different story from the one painted across his smiling face. A face that was practically quaking with ecstasy.

“I’ll dispose of them,” He choked, as if gasping for air.

Then Ian unexpectedly birthed something through the narrow canal of his compressed lips. I’d never been so haunted by the mere sight of a tongue’s tip, but it told a dreadful story. The snake moved almost imperceptibly from one side to the other. Not quite licking lips. Not quite doing anything human. It retreated to the depths of mystery behind the man’s terrifying smile, and there followed a moment of stillness.

I screamed when Ian slammed his foot onto the accelerator. He refused to avert his gaze from me as our vehicle tore forwards.

The crowd scrambled to part down the middle, creating a safe passage for us. I closed my eyes and slammed my hands against my ears to mute the terrifying clunks of bodies falling off the bonnet. What horrified me more than the driver’s series of near-murders, however, was the unaffected temperament of the crowd. The injured fans did not shriek, but continued to squeal excitably, pounding on the windows as the car scorched past them.

Ian only diverted his attention from me to look at the road for fleeting moments. He clumsily manoeuvred to Rockwood Place, at the side of The Ritz, finally providing me with a route of access to the Stage Door.

“You’re here,” He croaked, tears now streaming down his cheeks as some foreign emotion passed across his face.

I suddenly realised that none of these people were joyous, and the cause of their hysteria became a menacing mystery. It wasn’t sadness. It seemed like some form of rage, but even that did not explain it. It was alien. An emotion that would’ve driven my ‘fans’ to do terrible things if I’d only allowed them to get close enough.

Feeling Ian’s smiling face inch closer, lips drifting farther apart to reveal that unnatural tongue once more, I fled the car in unbridled horror. It was a brief sprint from the vehicle to the Stage Door, but my calves felt limp and lifeless by the time I reached it. My ears throbbed from the roar of the fans who’d noticed me fleeing the vehicle. I heard the soles of shoes pounding against tarmac as they pursued me.

“Let me in!” I screamed as I banged my fist painfully on the Stage Door.

“FEN!” A girl screamed from the entrance to the alley, before descending into a frenzied spiral of repetition. *“LOOK AT ME, FEN. LOOK. LOOK. LOOK. LOOK.”*

I took a foolish glance to the side and saw a teenager at the forefront of the wide-eyed mob. I’d seen videos of crowds swarming famous artists. The Beatles. One Direction. But this wasn’t that. It wasn’t a mob of gleeful fans. Whatever disturbing emotion lurked in their eyes, it wasn’t glee. They weren’t happy to see me. I imagined they would tear me limb from limb if they were to reach me, but part of me knew that a swift death would be better than whatever they really had planned.

Moments before the wave of ravenous fans seized me, the Stage Door creaked open, and I did not wait for an invitation. I barged into the venue and locked the door a mere second before fists pounded against it. Before bodies pounded against it, judging by the immense thuds. And when I finally summoned the courage to spin on my heel, I expected to face yet another deranged fan. One who might bring about my end.

Surprisingly, however, I faced a befuddled young woman wearing plaited hair, tattered jeans, and a black blouse. The name on her lanyard read ‘Gina Campbell’.

“Are you okay?” She asked.

“No,” I panted.

“I’m so sorry for not answering straight away, Mr Davies. If I’d known what it was like out there, I would’ve been ready and waiting to let you inside,” Gina said.

I shook my head and took a deep breath. “It’s not your fault. It’s been a strange day. A strange few days.”

The woman nodded, looking at me with curious but refreshingly-human eyes. And I saw something in her stare. Something that I felt too. I wasn’t imagining things. Wasn’t simply spluttering on my first spoonful of fame. This was all wrong. All horribly, horribly wrong.

“I didn’t even know your name last week,” Gina eventually admitted. “Now, your name’s all I hear on TikTok. Your music too, obviously. Though I haven’t taken the time to learn the dance, I’m afraid.”

“Dance?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

She smiled. “You’re not that old, are you? The dance to your song. Eagle. It’s lame, but your music isn’t. I’m just surprised by how popular you’ve… Sorry, I didn’t mean that. You’re really good. It was rude of me to–”

“– No, I agree,” I interrupted, laughing as I relished in my first normal interaction for days. “I wasn’t ready for this. You’re not the only person who knew nothing about me last Thursday. I’m convinced that I caught my own mother nearly calling me by my brother’s name from time to time.”

Gina chuckled, motioning for me to follow her. “Well, come on. I’ll show you to the dressing room. You’ve got an hour until your set starts. I’ll be back in about forty minutes.”

Left to my own devices for a short while, I digested all that had happened with the unsettling mob in the street. I considered that I might have imagined things. Might have been overwhelmed by the staggering success I’d experienced over the course of a few days. From an introvert to a concert headliner. From near-poverty to riches.
