It’s hard to trust anyone after what happened but knowing that the public will not be informed about the truth has me worried beyond belief. Maybe because it’s all too far-fetched? Hell, I don’t know. I suppose I should be careful with what I say, but I now know something that was obviously intended to be kept a secret. I don’t exactly know how deep they’ve got their hands in everything but after I share this with you here, I am sure someone will be sent to track me down and erase me from existence. Someone is always watching. However, after everything that happened, I don’t really fear that or even death right now because there’s something else out there that is much more horrifying than simply taking your last breath. I need to tell anyone I can about *everything* that happened when I was a security guard for this steel plant.

&#x200B;

After I finish writing this, I will submit my knowledge to a news station, but I’ve decided to share information *here* that is more descriptive, and I will do my best to include conversations that were important. It should go without saying that some identities will be protected, security guards usually call fellow guards by last name, but I think I should be careful anyways. All you need to know right now is that this happened in the states.

&#x200B;

Let me tell you a bit about myself. You can just call me Dee. I am a 42-year-old single male and after being hospitalized from a gunshot wound from active duty, I was honorably discharged with compensation packets. I am not proud of this, but I started drinking after the swelling and antibiotics were gone. Being hit with this quick depression, I never wanted to commit to anything other than occasionally attempting to work out and get through the pain. I was gaining extra weight, I hated the idea of counseling and thought about getting a dog, but my pain subsided enough for me to finally say enough *was* enough. I was losing money and it was time to get a job, so I put in several applications online to become a security guard or anything that welcomed my background in the military. Stick to what you know, right?

&#x200B;

For years, I made my way through the world of being a security guard (with the occasional aches and stiffness) and guarded all sorts of off-limit areas, government facilities, banks, offices, factories you name it. Some employers even welcomed my license to carry a firearm. I tried not to lean towards jobs like that, but when the money is right, the money is right. Now becoming more comfortable in the field of being both an armed and unarmed security guard, I sort of made a name for myself and would eventually do my own freelance work for various companies in private security.

&#x200B;

Some people paid top dollar to guard things that even I had no true knowledge of what it could be. Those jobs came with signing NDAs, and I won’t lie though, I enjoyed the feeling some of those jobs gave me. Especially the ones needing people with the experience I have to just keep their eyes peeled for armed intruders and to fire on-site like I was in some action movie where Arnold Schwarzenegger would pop out and start a gunfight. On regular security jobs you are not permitted to take another person's life and use deadly force, but for private security, things can get more serious. This particular job, after a while, became very much like that. But far, far worse than I could ever imagine.

&#x200B;

I was contacted by a company, and obviously I will not be naming here, to guard multiple buildings located in \[REDACTED\] for both day and night shifts. The area itself was barren with a patch of forest to the south of the facility and owned property lines fenced off and marked with “no trespassing” signs surrounding the zone for miles. There was a total of six buildings to guard: Buildings A through F with A being the closest to the parking lot. Railroad tracks were behind two main operating buildings that were labeled C and D. Building A was where they assembled parts and a conveyor belt ran all the way through to building C to deliver scrap. Buildings A and B were opposite each other and by them was a trailer for workers, our guard building and a yard for trucks to load supplies with dumpsters and a shed for maintenance.

&#x200B;

Opposite that was the parking lot and our main gate with a guard that seems to be there 24/7. We can just call him Phil. Buildings E and F were used for housing supplies and building B was basically empty, save for some discarded equipment. The building itself was constructed farther away from the other ones. There's a window in the guard's office that allows you to see the gap between B and A. I didn’t really know what that building was used for, but I actually enjoyed guarding this place for the nine months I was there. Until they asked me to sign some documents in the guards building. Then, everything spiraled straight into a nightmare.

&#x200B;

The day started out like any normal day. I don’t like being early or late, so I showed up right as my day shift was about to start as always. I was greeted by Phil, showed him my ID card and was cleared to enter. I then pulled into the parking lot, got out and headed for the guard's office. Looking around, I noticed two nondescript vehicles parked on the dirt road where deliveries would be with traffic cones placed by one of the vans. Must be some inspectors, I thought. Usually, I am told when they have people like that come to do their checks by phone the day prior and this place is huge, so I figured they’d have a team to help, and it might be one of those “sorry forgot to mention” things management pulled. Once I made my way closer to the guard's office and glanced over at building B, there was a group of men with jumpsuits and respirators gathered around the front of it. They were installing a card reader on the main entrance doors, but the actual door was gone.

&#x200B;

I started walking a bit slower and then noticed the welding machine. Trailing behind the other men, there was an industrial and very expensive looking hand truck being pushed and supported by three more of them near the opening. It was carrying a brand new heavily reinforced door. That was definitely something you don’t see every day. Shaking off the weird feeling I got from seeing that, I swiped my key card and opened the guard's office door noticing I had guests seemingly waiting for my arrival. The man in charge of all operations, Sam, was with two people in black suits standing near the surveillance station. I rarely see this guy ever. I then noticed an extra monitor was installed as well, watching those men outside install this new door. One of the suited men held a packet of paper and the other guard assigned with me, we’ll call him Ray, was already sitting down by one of the windows opposite them.

&#x200B;

“What’s this all about?” I asked Sam. “It’s all right. Just go ahead and clock in then sit down, please.” Sam told me, trying to sound polite and I looked over at the two men before stamping my timecard and sitting down in a chair. The two men looked at each other and the one on the left took a step forward.

&#x200B;

“A pleasure to meet you. How are you doing today?” He asked with a tone that did not sound friendly in the slightest. Monotone and emotionless. He extended his hand in greeting.

&#x200B;

“Fine.” I shook the man's hand and he continued.

&#x200B;

“I am special agent Franks, and this is Calloway. We represent Optimal Solutions in a collaborative operation with the United States Government to store medical supplies and other materials that may be hazardous if mistreated.” He set down a stack of papers on the metal desk nearest me. “You can read about us in that packet if you’d like. We need to occupy building B for a period of time since it is not operational here. The area will be disinfected and anything we work on will be contained inside the warehouse. We apologize for any inconvenience.” He paused, probably to see my reaction.

&#x200B;

“Okay.” I said, picking up the sheets of paper and skimming the details about this subcontracting medical research group while listening.

&#x200B;

“I understand this may seem unusual and on short notice for you security guards stationed here. We’ve already spoken with Sam, and he has allowed us access to the building.” He paused again and put his hands on his hips. “Now, the work we do is not only important, but it is crucial we are in a secure location. I would like to explain a few things. Is that alright?” He asked the two of us guards and I glanced over at Ray. Ray shrugged and spoke.

&#x200B;

“I’m already here, just get on with it.” I nodded my head in agreement and looked back at Franks, handing him the packet of papers.

&#x200B;

“Due to this particular work study, the identities of people involved, and the nature of the work is considered highly classified and any information about this cannot be disclosed to the public. I am sure you have already gathered that we are installing a reinforced door over at building B. We are asking that you include this area in your perimeter checks during daytime. At night, we will be stationing armed men under our direct payroll by those doors. Watching over the camera feed is only required for you then, but you will be given our frequency to speak directly to us on those devices. No one besides us should be allowed access. That door will be used for our personnel only. We are going to be staying within the compound throughout the time we are here. M.R.E. 's have been issued and workers quarters are currently being installed. No one gets in and no one is permitted to leave the premises until we have completed the work or have been given authorization. We have already installed another camera watching that area as well, so it can be easier for you to keep watch while fulfilling your other duties.” He pointed out the monitor. Ray spoke up.

&#x200B;

“Damn. I don’t suppose we aren’t getting paid more for this crap? Keeping quiet and all that.” He asked, chuckling. That was one thing I liked about Ray. We would be on the same tip with money, because I was about to ask about the same thing. He just had the balls to ask first.

&#x200B;

“Your time and service for all of this will cause a substantial increase in your already agreed upon payment arrangements. If you do not wish to participate, you *are* free to leave but you will not be able to return to this area once we have occupied it. If you want to return to work after we are finished, you’ll have to talk to Sam here. Do you have any more questions?” He replied and I thought about why they chose this location of all places. It was basically in the middle of nowhere and I had to wonder about that. This was in the beginning of November, and it was going to be snowing soon. Although, I wasn’t completely shocked. Companies all over the world would occupy facilities for a period of time to store materials, operate in or even collaborate on business within this particular field when supply chain demand was low. Maybe there was something they couldn’t tell us. It seemed to me that they operated through more unconventional methods, but that was obviously between Sam and them and whatever was going on is federal level shit.

&#x200B;

“It sounds like we don’t really have a choice about any of this. What kind of supplies are you talking about, like vaccines and medicine?” I asked. He just remained stoic and replied.

&#x200B;

“That is classified information. You are not to share anything about our whereabouts to anyone and if you do it is punishable by law as you will read in the non-disclosure agreement. If you are feeling some... discomfort about this, you of course will be handsomely compensated upon leaving, but unfortunately, we will not be able to offer anything else at this time.” He said, smiling and did not speak for a moment. I had the thought that maybe they were trying to store a new kind of medicine to help fight this recent outbreak and needed to keep a low profile from other competitors or something. I don’t know how any of that works, but I can only speculate because of how brutal the world has been getting over the years.

&#x200B;

I have read reports where the military might need to occupy an area for things like logistics or storing shipments in civilian territory because there was no space for the operation in a base at the time. This is a steel plant, after all. Perfect size for a military operation. They obviously must have deduced that this is one of the more lesser-known steel manufacturers in the U.S. and hasn’t had many intruders in the past. These places are filled with areas where vandals would want to break in or even urban explorers. There is also the risk of armed intruders wanting to rob the place for scrap. Throughout the time I have been here though, no such occurrence has ever happened. It was a pretty lax job and would just include the normal day to day routine and the night shift involved trying to stay awake most of the time. I still was required to keep my pistol on me at all times while patrolling the property though. This new ordeal here actually excited me in a strange way.

&#x200B;

“Okay... How long will you be operating here, and are there any other duties included?” I inquired. I wanted to ask so much more but I knew when to stop prying and could use the extra cash. It’s not like I could just outright ask them: “*Why are you guys using a secluded warehouse for top secret work?”* without them getting to some level of annoyance with my questions. The other man piped up.

&#x200B;

“As long as it takes for us to finish. Your job will be no different from what you are already doing here. You are free to report any abnormalities you may find concerning at any time. We’re just spending some time in that warehouse and yeah, there may be extra tasks required depending on the situation. You *do* have military experience.” Calloway offered with an attitude I didn’t particularly like. What did he mean by that? They must have spoken with Sam about me and Ray. Ray never served but was on the force some time ago and was permitted to carry. I looked over at Sam briefly and he just gave me a blank stare while scratching the back of his head. Franks spoke again.

&#x200B;

“Have we come to an understanding? We are running out of time. Our work is important, we just want everyone on the same page. Will you adhere to these requirements?”

&#x200B;

I gave it a once-over in my head, spending a passing moment to get my thoughts right and bury any red flags I may have noticed. This whole meeting happened so suddenly, and I didn’t exactly get a whole lot of time to think about any of this. More money was always a plus too and I opted to play the grunt I was being paid for by saying: “Yes, sir.” then signing the non-disclosure agreement. Ray followed our new “orders” as well.

&#x200B;

The next two weeks after this were fairly normal minus the worker that walked out during a shift. I was checking building C and made my way around the perimeter. This was a first for me, but one of the exit doors nearby flew open with a worker in full gear frantically muttering something to himself. I watched as the man walked towards the parking lot while fumbling with his keys and lunchbox then disappeared behind a corner. Just then my radio crackled to life.

&#x200B;

***“Patrol 1, this is management. We have a worker going home. No action needed. Out.”***

&#x200B;

Stunned, I stood there for a moment thinking of what could have happened, so I recklessly advanced in his direction. “Wait!” I called out and began jogging his way and made it about twenty or so feet behind him. He did not slow down or stop for me. He continued walking quickly, turning another corner and eventually was out of my sight. I don’t normally act out of impulse, but the manner in which this man left his shift made me anxious. An action like this would probably cause my employer to wonder about me but I didn’t really care at the time. He looked terrified out of his mind. It was someone I was familiar with but never got his name. He’s been here since I arrived, so he had to have been here for over a year.

&#x200B;

Making my way around the corner, still jogging, I saw that he was already approaching his vehicle and getting in, so I slowed down and eventually stopped. Phil was flagged and he got the gate opened for him. It looked like the guy was shouting at Phil in his car to hurry up. I was standing near the edge of where the parking lot meets the property and Phil noticed me. I could see he looked at me frowning, shrugging his shoulders. When I asked one of the supervisors about it later, he informed me that the employee was suddenly hit with a panic attack and began feeling claustrophobic to the point where he had to go home. He marked him down on an attendance sheet and looked up at me.

&#x200B;

“I hate to say this... I think the guy is on drugs or something. Keep an eye on him, yeah? He wasn’t threatening or anything but… still. Josh has been working here for three years and only had one incident with a machine but it was pretty moderate. No one acts like that here. I’m going to have a talk with him, that’s for sure. I just let the guy go home to calm down for the rest of the day. I can’t deal with any freak-outs, we have a business to run.” He explained and I agreed. I told him I would keep a close eye on him and got back to my duties.

&#x200B;

Another two weeks passed and, on a Wednesday, when Ray told me something that had me a little worried about these people occupying the building. Monday through Wednesday I have the day shift. Wednesday through Saturday is my night shift, and he has the opposite schedule. “Dee, you got a minute?” He asked while I was about to clock out. He had a troubled expression on his face. “Yeah. Everything alright?” I asked, glancing over at the monitors. He also looked at the monitors, showing these people hauling in huge computers and for some reason, large loudspeakers through the warehouse shutter door in building B and then looked back at me.

&#x200B;

“I don’t know, dude. I was doing a sweep by Sam's office and overheard him on the phone with someone.” He put his hands up in a defensive gesture. “You know me, I don’t screw around, and I wasn’t trying to eavesdrop. I just happened to be near his office with a janitor mopping when we both heard him yelling in there. He was fuckin’ loud, dude. The door was shut but it sounded like something bad was going on. I heard him shouting shit like: \* *How come I was never told about this? We already had a deal! \** Then we heard something break in there. We just looked at each other and went our separate ways after that.” He finished by wiping some sweat from his forehead. “What the hell could all of that be about?” He asked, quietly.

&#x200B;

“Sounds to me like we are in for more than just being guards now.” I replied with a pit in my stomach. If something wasn’t sitting right with me at first, there was definitely something weird going on now. I glanced at the monitor with the reinforced door with the two guards armed to the teeth and wondered what could be going on that we don’t know about. Looking back, I should have just found a new gig right then and there.

&#x200B;

From here, workers inside buildings A and C were complaining about a buzzing in their ears and having high stress levels. I would sometimes hear strange whirring noises when I would go by the three buildings A, B and C. Not anything from the work here, but more like a tinnitus. I figured that it was some kind of machinery they had in there that caused the ringing, like some kind of emission frequency or something similar. I did see them haul in huge machines and various computers throughout this whole process too, so I can only speculate. Maybe something with the speakers. This only piqued my curiosity even more. Just what the hell are they doing in there? Having a fucking concert? However, before I could even begin to think about bringing my concerns up to Sam, there was another duty added to my checklist right around then. One of the mill supervisors called me when I was at home to inform me that there will be a construction crew digging below building B. Apparently to fix some issues with a piping system underneath the building that was causing some kind of leak. We were instructed to watch over that area as well once the leak was taken care of.

&#x200B;

“Does it maybe have something to do with what’s causing the buzzing in everyone's ears?” I said and I heard him chuckle. It was probably a stupid question, but I asked anyway. “I don’t know, we had to shut down operations today and tomorrow, so you guys got a day off while they fumigate whatever this is and clear it. We haven’t been down there in years, so it doesn’t really come as a surprise since they got an operation going on. Only natural to find some old pipes that may have burst. Maybe it was an accident. They better be more careful with whatever the hell they’re doing, but if they clear it then I don’t really see the problem. As long as no one gets killed, I guess.” He told me, chuckling again. “I’m confused.” I only said. “Yeah, you and me both buddy. I’ll talk to you later.”

&#x200B;

The first day I had to work with the extra duty included started off with me spilling coffee all over my work pants causing me to almost be late for once. The construction crews were to be on-site and would remain underneath the building for the next month or so. Sam seemed to be pretty upset about this, and it was earlier confirmed when Ray spoke about the phone call he overheard. I can only assume, at least. There was a huge hole they dug just to the east side of the building and for up to twelve hours a day, we would see the workers doing their thing. Throughout all of it, I couldn’t really keep tabs on everything they were doing exactly. No, my workload was getting in the way of me trying to catch a look at anything out of the ordinary. Minus this entire crew being here and the special agents, of course.

&#x200B;

As time went on, we were given tasks like helping with maintenance or patrolling the outer edge of the property for a time, as if someone would be there. We were to report any suspicious persons and keep our pistols on us. Plus, that ringing would sometimes still bother me, and I was starting to get really anxious ever since. If I was sitting by the cameras, I would catch myself fidgeting my leg up and down so fast it was like my nephews' video game controllers vibrating. I would have to grab my leg and force myself to relax. Not only was I stressed about these new patrols, but it was something else. Like as if an uncontrollable urge to either bite my nails off or scratch at an area would persist. After a week passed, we got another hire to come in and patrol with me and Ray on the night shifts only. He was a shorter middle-aged guy, really quiet but did his job well and his name was Jeff. I never got any other information about him, but this is around the time where things started to get for lack of a better term; scary.

&#x200B;

It was mid-December and the construction crews finally finished up their work. At around one in the morning when Jeff and I were monitoring the camera feed. I was shaking my leg so fast it was causing a slight ticking noise to occur as the wind outside howled. No snow was on the forecast, just a bitter chill in the air mixed with the darkness of night. Obviously when the night shift rolls around, there’s no workers present in the mill and the two armed guards are stationed in front of the new door, decked out in urban BDU’s and winter gear. It was here when looking at the monitors displaying the camera feeds that I spotted movement near one of the windows located on the second level of building B. It was through a feed that had to be panned over to get a better look.

&#x200B;

At first, I could only recognize the outline of a shape, but it almost looked like a door opening. Clearly, someone wearing light colored clothes appeared past the open door crouching down. It was already pitch-black outside and the resolution from the camera wasn’t all that great, but we could still see them. “Zoom in, right there.” I told Jeff who was already on it and zoomed in to where I pointed. It was a person and I noticed they had something that looked like a phone in their hand. I had no knowledge of how to even get up there from inside. They must have found a ladder or emergency stairwell for roof access.

&#x200B;

Sure enough, I began to see the person crawling on a ledge and eventually made their way to their feet. It was here when I noticed the person was wearing a lab coat. After I frantically searched through binders and folders that might contain the map of the interior, I found it and confirmed there was indeed a roof access staircase inside building B. I looked up to the feed again, still baffled, noticing they began climbing onto the roof. Just then I remembered what that rude agent, Calloway, said to me.

&#x200B;

“*You are free to report any abnormalities you may find concerning at any given time.*”

&#x200B;

I grabbed my radio and changed the channel to their frequency.

&#x200B;

“We’ve got a situation; someone is on top of building B!” I shouted over the radio, and I made my way to the door. I looked back to Jeff. “I’ve got this handled, monitor everything here and if things go south, you know what to do!” I unholstered my pistol and Jeff gave me a stern look. He nodded and I got the door open. I sprinted to building B and didn’t stop until I got to the entrance of the building. The armed guards had their rifles aimed up at the top of the building and that’s when I saw him. The person on the roof was holding up some kind of device.

&#x200B;

“*It’s too late! I already sent it to them. They are on their way!”*

&#x200B;

The man shouted down at us and began laughing like he was on the verge of a mental breakdown. The armed guards had flashlight attachments and were keeping their aim on his torso. Two red dots were focused on his lab attire by the ID tag.

&#x200B;

I was about ten feet away from the commandos and one of them noticed me. “GET BACK TO YOUR BUILDING, NOW!” He shouted and I jumped at the sudden commanding voice. Just then, there was that ringing in my ears again. I was so confused and felt a ball form in my chest and stomach. I couldn’t quite gauge what the hell was happening just then. I felt like this was some military drill or something to see what we would do in case of an emergency like this. That ringing persisted, it *was* tolerable, but sounded like there were speakers all around me blasting this dog whistle kind of noise. I shook my head and got back to my senses and the ringing was to a minimum now. The man on the roof looked to be a scientist or researcher that must have been helping out with whatever they are doing here. I couldn’t see his body entirely but now; the man was holding his ears with the device still in his hand.

&#x200B;

*“You made this mess!”* The man kept shouting this over and over until I heard the gunshot.

&#x200B;

Another operative must have gotten up there. My heart sank when the spray of crimson misted in the air as the hole burst through the man's forehead. His arms went to his sides, and he slumped forward, falling the two stories into a crumpled heap on the ground in front of the soldiers. The device the man was holding lay broken in pieces on the concrete next to the blood that began pooling around his body. My eyes went wide with fear, and I couldn’t stop my heart from pounding. I’ve seen death before, many times... But the context here had me questioning my reality.

&#x200B;

*“*Hostile neutralized. Clean up unit, come to the entrance.” One of the men reported it on their radio.

&#x200B;

I should have left. I should have said to hell with the money and gone home, but now I was right in the stink of this crap. I just witnessed not only something that wasn't meant for civilians to see, but a murder. Alarm bells began going off despite the ringing that still persisted. Before I knew it, the soldier closest to me aimed his rifle at me and paced forward.

&#x200B;

“Woah, woah! What the hell!?” I was blinded by the flashlight and raised my hands up.

&#x200B;

“STAY WHERE YOU ARE!” He shouted and I kept my hands up with the gun dangling from my finger. “Easy! I’m not a threat!” I tried pleading with this guy and did my best to keep my gaze fixed on the gas mask the operative was wearing. It was here where a constant flood of intrusive thoughts invaded my mind. Who was that scientist talking about? Who is on their way? Could they hear the ringing too? Was their gear suppressing them from hearing it? Was I being exposed to radiation? Are these guys even Military? Now I had this sudden urge to draw my pistol and fire upon them but what good would that even do?

&#x200B;

“DROP YOUR WEAPON SLOWLY!” He barked and I slowly put my pistol on the cold pavement. If I was going to do anything right, I had to stay alive and play along with their demands.

&#x200B;

To keep things as short as I possibly can, I was rushed back to the guards building and told to stay put until they finished handling the situation. We were told to not call for authorities, as a unit was already on its way for medical care. A soldier remained inside the guards building with us until our shift ended. However, we did not get to go home and nobody else came in to work that day... It was at this point where the entire facility had been officially taken over and captured by a renegade force that snuck their ranks into the United States Government and posed as anything other than a threat to humankind.

&#x200B;

The commandos were already freaky enough, I should have known better than to sit back and allow this to happen, but it was already too late. My gun was left outside and undoubtedly taken by them. The jig was up, and Jeff and I were taken hostage inside the guard's office.
