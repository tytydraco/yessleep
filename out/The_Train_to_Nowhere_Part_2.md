If you haven't read [The First Part](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/SFnOKRkpd5) I suggest doing so before continuing.

I lounged beneath a tree as Sue and Phil worked on their homework. It had been a long week of boring classes and impromptu quizzes and I was doing my best to procrastinate my workload until Monday morning.

“You know if you did it now, you wouldn’t have to wait until minutes before it was due to finish it,” Sue said, looking up from her work, a hand blocking the sun out from her eyes. 

“The whole point of the train is to enjoy the places it takes us, not to cram as much of the real world inside it.”

“She has a point, Joe. If you went ahead and did it you wouldn’t feel so rushed. Plus you wouldn’t have to copy my work,” Phil said, nose still inches from the paper.

“Then how would you feel if you didn’t have someone to beg for your mercy and praise your work all the time,” I mockingly asked.

“Oh, I’d do just fine. Plus, I wouldn’t have teachers constantly asking if you copied my work.”

“Like they can tell the difference as it is,” I said, standing up and walking over. “It is getting close to departure time anyways, we don’t want to miss the return trip.”

We packed up our belongings and strolled back to the station, within minutes the train appeared and welcomed us aboard. As the others boarded behind us, we found seats and I laid my head against the window. Glancing out at the oasis and pyramids, I saw one of the seniors of our school rushing towards the train. Just as he reached the station platform, the train departed back to our town. He had missed it by seconds, and the wait for the next return would not be pleasant.

When riding the Train to Nowhere, there are a few important things to remember.

You always pay for your ticket, no matter the secret. 
If you miss the return trip, you must wait at the station for the next return.
If you are returning after missing the train, ALWAYS board the return trip home
The cost of riding to the end of the line is greater than what you will find there

I have missed the return trip only once since I started taking the train. Ever since I have always made sure to not miss it ever again.

It had been our first time riding beyond Egypt, our anticipation was higher than it had ever been before. When we scribbled our secret on the back of the ticket and handed it to the conductor he had paused before moving to the next group.

“Ah, the young gentlemen and young lady wish to see the fabulous features of France today,  how exciting!” His enticing and cheerful tone did not match his starving eyes. We nodded and turned our heads away from him.

“Remember, the longer we ride out, the less time you have to explore. Make sure you keep track of the time. It would be a great sorrow to see any of you lose your head.” The cheerful warning echoed in our minds, but the most unsettling was his plastered smile that never seemed to falter from his face.

When the train returned, we had been in a full sprint. Not used to the much shorter time. Phil and Sue had barely boarded as the train departed leaving me behind. I sat on the ground with a thud, worried about the warning I had received before we arrived.

The atmosphere had changed as soon as the train departed. What had been the city of lights had slowly grown dark and a new brightness began to emerge.

Flames across the city began to arise as the fire of cannons and gunshots echoed the station. From outside I could hear chants of “Viva la Revolution” and “Mortem Tyrannis” as I curled myself up and waited the long hours for my brother and girlfriend to return. 

Those long hours spent with the ground shaking beneath me, the gates leading into the station repeatedly bombarded with the pounding of fists and the begging of people to be let in. All I could do was huddle in fear as I prayed for the train to return.

After what felt like hours, the train returned, dropping off another group of travellers. Sue and Phil rushed from the train and embraced me, worry plastered on their faces. We waited at the station for the return trip. It would be months before I ever braved beyond Egypt after that experience.

“It is always polite to board once the train has returned, sir” The Conductor stated as I boarded later.

“I’m sorry, I lost track of time,” I said, refusing to make eye contact with the smiling face above me.

“No harm no foul. Just be conscious of the time going forward,” He said, placing a gloved hand on my shoulder in a gesture that was anything but comforting. I began to write on the back of a ticket but was stopped.

“No need at all, sir. Every ticket is a round trip, you just missed your scheduled return. Do make certain that you do your absolute best to avoid any delays in boarding the return train,” The Conductor said, giving my shoulder a slight squeeze, his face unchanging in its expression. “It tends to be a great inconvenience for you or anyone else when having to wait for the following return trip.”

I hurried to a seat at the table with Phil and Sue, eager to go back home and try to put the voices screaming out of my mind. I was fortunate to at least be at the station when I missed the train. It was unveiling what would have happened had I been caught outside when the chaos erupted.

When we arrived back in town, the first thing I did was rush home with Phil. Despite my absence for the entirety of a Saturday, our parents had hardly noticed our absence. The nonchalant attitude of parents in the town. One of the few benefits of small town living, or just the haze that circulated the apathy held stronger than any faith.

The train rests to the east of town, an old steam engine with a stagecoach that hasn’t officially ran since the early 1900s. After the logging mill closed, and the necessity of transporting workers in and out dried up, the train was parked and left forgotten.

The vines and weeds have slowly taken over as pieces of metal were slowly hauled away. Yet, many of the town’s youth will find their way to the train for the promise of adventure to far away lands. Many, myself included, are never brave enough to tempt our fate with the cemetery. All who ride spent many failed searches for the Sleeping Shack only to find sore feet and muddy shoes, with the occasional twig still caught in hair.

So, we ride the Train to Nowhere, a pleasant time for all who are willing to pay the price. A secret they hold, scribbled on a piece of paper. The Conductor collects these many secrets and feeds them to the driver. Fueling our adventures with the lies we tell everyday.

The greater the secret the further we can go.

I always wonder what secret could be told to reach the end of the line. Would the prize at the end be worth the secret that is needed?
