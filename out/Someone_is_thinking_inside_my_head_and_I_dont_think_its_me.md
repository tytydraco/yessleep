The medicine man was hustling us.

It was as clear as day that he didn't know shit about what he was talking about. I gave him another long look as we trudged along the forest trail, and felt a rush of irritation wash over me.

In the moonlight, his side profile was striking, sharp and chiseled, like something out of an old myth. The curve of his nose and cheekbones cast soft shadows, and his braid rested against his shoulder, a single strand of hair slipping loose to brush his jaw. His earring caught a faint glint of silver, flickering like a distant star.

He looked the part of a medicine man, a living embodiment of ancient culture and arcane wisdom. That's what I'd thought a few hours ago, at least. But then he opened his mouth and started talking.

I felt a wild urge to pull my arm back and slap him, but I pushed the feeling down.

"The yee naaldlooshii must sleep in his burrow for a full day and night after he takes someone," the medicine man said, his deep, resonant voice carrying through the still air. "He uses that time to fully transform into them, to walk in their skin. In the old tongue, yee naaldlooshii means 'with it, he goes on all fours.'"

"That's craaazy, man," Pete said, his voice laced with awe as he trained the handheld camcorder on our guide. "So how does he take someone, exactly? Like, does he just rip their skin off and wear it like some Gucci?" He giggled.

The old man turned to him, fixing him with a look I couldn't quite decipher. For a long moment, he said nothing, as though carefully weighing his response. Then he spoke.

"When the naaldlooshii takes, it's more than just a physical process. It is deeply spiritual. He takes a person's essence, their life breath. There are rituals he must follow."

I couldn't take it anymore.

"Pause the video," I snapped at Pete, grabbing his shoulder and dragging him a little ways away from the old man. Leaves crunched underfoot as my angry steps led the way, Pete stumbling behind me.

"Hey, man, what's your problem?" Pete complained, wrenching my hand off his shoulder.

"Are you listening to this crackpot?" I hissed. "He's just putting on a gravelly voice and spewing whatever nonsense pops into his head." My voice came out louder than I intended, and I cast a quick glance at the medicine man. He was still standing in the same spot, his face obscured by the shadows of the trees. I couldn't tell if he'd heard me or not.

"What does it matter?" Pete asked, his tone genuinely confused.

"What?" I couldn't believe my ears.

"I said, what does it matter if he's lying to us? That's the whole point of coming out here, man. The viewers will eat up anything he says because he's Navajo. That's what we're paying him for."

"He..." I began, but Pete cut me off.

"Seriously, man, what's up with you? We talked about this before we came here. Are you sure you're good? Ever since you got lost earlier, you've been acting...off."

My anger deflated.

"I'm fine," I muttered, embarrassed.

Earlier that day, I'd gotten lost in the forest. I'd been distracted, wandering off the trail without realizing it. It hadn't taken long for Pete and the medicine man to find me, probably less than 20 minutes, but it was humiliating. The way the old man had looked at me, like I was some helpless city boy lost in the big, bad woods, It stung.

I was a helpless city boy, but it wasn't a pleasant feeling to be reminded of it. Maybe that's why I was being such a jerk to him. I needed to chill.

Suddenly, I felt like an idiot. The Navajo man had done nothing wrong. He was giving us exactly what we'd asked for.

"I'm fine, mate. Just tired, you know?" I said, managing a smile.

Pete nodded, clapping me on the shoulder.

"Alright. Let's go."

We made our way back to the waiting medicine man, who didn't say a word. He simply turned and resumed walking up the path as though nothing had happened.

Pete tucked the camcorder into his bag. We'd pick up filming once we got to the camp.

Pete was my best friend. We'd grown up together, gone to the same schools, and now we were business partners. Our YouTube channel was going to be massive.

The forest was eerily quiet. During the day, it had been alive with bird calls, rustling bushes, and the subtle hum of nature. But now, silence reigned. Only the wind whistled through the branches, a sound that felt more unsettling than soothing.

We had been walking for about half a mile when I started noticing the medicine man's eyes on me. Every time I lifted my head, I caught him staring, his gaze sharp and unkind. There was no mistaking it now—he'd heard my earlier outburst.

His anger was justified, I supposed, but it didn't make his watchful eyes any less unnerving. I decided to keep my head down, avoiding his gaze entirely.

We trekked for another mile before the medicine man came to an abrupt stop.

"The animals," he said, his voice low. "There hasn't been a single sound in the past hour."

I opened my mouth to tell Pete to get the camcorder rolling, but he was already ahead of me. The camera was out, trained on the old man. This was the premium content we were paying for.

"That's not normal, right?" I asked, stepping into the shot.

"No, it is not. We might be in danger," the medicine man replied solemnly.

"Damn, this bastard is a good actor," I thought inwardly.

"What do you mean?" I asked, forcing a twinge of fear into my voice. We'll have to share that Oscar, Injun Joe.

"These forests are forbidden for a reason," the old man said, his eyes scanning the surrounding darkness. "I fear we may have stumbled upon the grounds of an unholy one."

Behind the camera, Pete grinned like an idiot. He could see the views already, just like me.

"You really think one of the yee naaldlooshii is around here somewhere?" I asked, layering exaggerated disbelief into my tone.

The medicine man didn't respond. His gaze narrowed, and his lips pursed tightly. He stared at me for what felt like an eternity, his face flickering with emotions I couldn't read.

"Turn the camera off," he said suddenly, his tone sharp.

"What the hell, man?" Pete exclaimed, pulling the camcorder back as the old man reached for it.

"What are you doing?" I asked, stepping forward.

The medicine man moved so quickly that leaves and dust swirled in his wake. "Move slowly toward me," he said, staring directly at Pete from a few yards away from where we stood.

"What the fuck, man? Are you threatening me?" Pete's voice was breathy, unsteady.

The old man didn't answer. In the faint moonlight, I couldn't make out his hands clearly, but when he flung them toward me, I instinctively ducked.

Nothing hit me—at least, nothing physical. But then the pain came, sudden and excruciating. It was as if a thousand needles were tearing into my flesh all at once. My skin felt like it was on fire.

A scream tore from my throat, cutting through the dead silence of the forest like a razor.

Pete's panicked voice broke through the chaos.

"What did you do to him? What the hell did you do?"

The pain seemed to stretch on for an eternity before it began to fade. When it finally subsided, I raised my head and locked eyes with the medicine man.

"What did you do to me?" I demanded, my voice hoarse and furious.

Pete was at my side, gripping my arm tightly. He must've known that if he let go, I would've stormed over to the old man and torn him apart.

"Peter," the medicine man said slowly, his voice steady and commanding. "Move away from him."

"See what I was saying? This crazy Injun is tweaking," I snapped at Pete.

He didn't respond—or if he did, I didn't hear it. A wave of pain crashed over me, sudden and overwhelming. It came so fast that my knees almost buckled. I clenched my eyes shut against it, groaning as the searing heat tore through me.

When the pain finally ebbed, I opened my eyes and froze. Pete was no longer beside me. He was sprawled on the ground a few yards away, his body drenched in dark, glistening red. Blood.

His face was pale, ashen, and his hands pressed desperately against his abdomen, trying to stem the flow of blood from a gaping wound. The ragged edges of it peeked through his fingers.

"What did you do?!" I screamed at the medicine man, who still stood motionless in the spot where I'd last seen him.

I wanted to charge him, tackle him to the ground, but the rational part of me held back. What weapon had he used to hurt Pete? I couldn't risk it. Pete needed me more.

"Buddy, are you…" I started, taking a step toward Pete.

But his eyes widened in terror, and he recoiled weakly, dragging his body backward with blood-slicked hands.

"What the hell?" I stopped in my tracks, confused.

Pete's gaze never left me, his eyes filled with something I could only describe as fear.

He was afraid of me.

Why? The medicine man was the one who hurt him, not me.

"Derek?" Pete's voice was weak, trembling. It wasn't a statement—it was a question.

"What's going on? Let me help—" I started again, stepping closer.

But then it came back. The pain.

It hit me like lightning, crackling through my body with vicious intensity. This time, it wasn't just pain. Something else came with it—something that froze the blood in my veins.

Thoughts.

Slippery and ancient, they pressed against my consciousness, pushing at the edges of my mind like nails digging into soft wood.

*I will kill the hatałii last.*

The thought wasn't mine. It was foreign, invasive. Yet somehow, I felt my body respond.

A bloodlust ignited deep within me, rising like a tidal wave. My core burned with a hunger for carnage.

"Away, yee naaldlooshii!" the old man screamed, his voice cutting through the fog in my mind and momentarily silencing the alien thoughts.

His hands moved in a blur, flinging something at me. A powder. I barely registered it before another wave of pain hit, stronger this time.

It wasn't like before. I knew my body was in pain—I could feel it—but it didn't seem like it was my pain. The scream that tore from my throat didn't sound like my own.

"Stupid hatałii!" My mouth moved, but the voice that emerged was not mine.

It was deeper, rougher. Ancient. Like the grind of granite on asphalt.

I felt it then. Something reached out and grabbed at my consciousness, yanking it away. It pulled me back, shoving me into the farthest corners of my mind. My body moved, but it wasn't me anymore.

I watched, helpless and horrified, as my arms began to change. The air was filled with a sickening popping sound as an unseen force twisted and broke my bones. My skin rippled and stretched, accommodating the grotesque new shapes underneath. More terrifying, however, was the familiarity of the unnatural change—it felt like my body remembered it.

My fingers lengthened unnaturally, the flesh tearing as black claws pushed through, shredding my nails in the process.

Then my legs followed. My entire body contorted and transformed, rising taller, leaner—no, not leaner. Predatory. I stood nearly eight feet tall, my silhouette a monstrous aberration.

My mouth brimmed with jagged, sharp teeth, pressing against my tongue. I could feel them.

And the smells.

The forest came alive in a way I'd never experienced before. The scent of animals hiding in the distance, the sweet scent of honeysuckle in the night air, and more delightful, the crisp tang of fear—it all flooded my senses.

I loved it.

The vestige of the boy clung onto my being like a parasite, but it was now the easiest thing to latch onto it and silence it forever.

The other one lay on the ground, staring up at me in terror.

He had soiled himself. The acrid scent clung to him, sharp and unmistakable. I could resist no longer.

My claws tore through his flesh and bone effortlessly, the resistance negligible. The headless body convulsed, blood erupting from the stump of his neck in violent bursts, painting the forest floor in crimson.

I smiled.

The boy's severed head still clung to life, his eyes wide with confusion. He hadn't yet registered that he was dead.

But he was of little consequence.

I turned away from him and fixed my gaze on the true prize.

"How is it that you are out here?" the hatałii asked, his voice steady despite the wariness in his eyes. "It has not been a day and a night."

"Indeed, it has not," I replied, inching closer to him. "I have walked these lands for many moons. The old ways no longer bind me as they once did."

I let the boy's young face stretch into a grotesque smile, jagged teeth gleaming. "With one of the Diné prancing about in my humble home, how could I wait?"

"You will not take me," the hatałii said calmly, unstrapping a medicine pouch from his back.

"We shall see." I beamed at the challenge, taking another step forward.

"Do indulge me, wise one," I continued, my voice dripping with mock respect. "When did you know?"

The hatałii paused, his sharp eyes locked on mine, weighing the question. Then he answered.

"Yee naaldlooshii." He said the words deliberately, resigned yet firm. "He said it exactly right. I had my suspicions, but that confirmed it."

"Impressive!" I declared, genuinely pleased. "You will make a worthy acquisition."

"Yee naaldlooshii," he repeated, his tone grim, reaching into his medicine pouch.

"Indeed," I affirmed, dropping to all fours.

I paid no mind to the blinking red light of the camcorder still perched on the ground, silently recording everything.

Instead, I focused on the hatałii, feeling the raw strength of my transformed muscles coiling in anticipation. My claws gripped the earth beneath me as I gathered power in my legs.

And then I exploded off the ground, launching myself toward the awaiting hatałii.
