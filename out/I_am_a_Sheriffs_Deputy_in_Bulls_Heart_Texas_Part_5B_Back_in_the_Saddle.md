\[Part 5A\]( I am a Sheriff's Deputy in Bull's Heart Texas. Part 5A. A conversation with my Ex. : nosleep (reddit.com))  
  
  
"You just tell me if you need anything else Deputy" Miss Ellie said as she topped up my coffee cup.  
  
  
I had been out of the hospital a week. This was my first night back on shift.  
  
  
"Miss Ellie..." I said "... you ain't got to fret over me, I'm good, I'm fixed up."  
  
  
She looked down at me for a moment, her feline features crinkled slightly, as if she was appraising me. Her eyes took on a vaguely disappointed feature.   
  
  
"Deputy, I had a boy like you once." She said after a long moment. I noticed that her fingers twitched slightly, as if she was imagining a cigarette between them.  
  
"He would get banged up on some fool's errand or another and every time...Every damn time... He would run off on some other damn fool errand's before He was ready to go again. Never took the time to heal up properly. In nineteen hundred and thirty seven some damn fool Thor worshipping cultist emptied a Sub Machine gun into his chest down in Mexico..... He didn't get the chance to heal up after that...."  
  
  
Miss Ellie reached down and put two clawed fingers on the edge of the half-eaten plate of steak and eggs on the table in front of me. I had pushed it away from me and she slid it right back to me.  
  
  
"Now your appetite isn't all the way back yet. Normally you would be asking for another plate by this point. That tells me you aren't done healing. So finish your food, or so help me, you aren't going to be given the chance to heal up either."  
  
  
I stared up at her for a minute. She stared right back at me. Her eyes had an air of matronly threat to them. Just big yellow cat eyes glaring back down at me.  
  
  
I could tell her that I had a full clean bill of health from the hospital. That I had eaten a big lunch. That I was fine.  
That my authority as a Sheriff's Deputy superseded Her’s as a waitress. That I was a paying customer. That what I ate was none of her damn business.  
  
  
But what I actually said was:  
  
  
"Yes, Miss Ellie" whilst picking up my fork.  
  
  
I stabbed up a fork full of eggs and dead cow and shoveled them into my mouth.  
Ellie fixed me with a toothy approving smile and turned away from my table. I swore she was purring as she walked away to check on another customer.  
  
  
  
It didn't matter if I was good to go or not. Ellie was going to be Ellie, and all I could do was what I was told. Besides. It ain't a bad thing, having someone give a shit about you.  
  
  
I ate my dinner in silence. I had a lot to think about during my down time. Why did the shit birds attack? Who sent them? Why did they send them? Who was the dipshit watching the fight from the porch? Was he 'The Master?' Was he a Necromancer, like Daliwal had floated as the Miller's executioner?  
  
  
Near as anyone could figure it, the Miller's might have tried to do a deal with something or someone, which went real wrong real fast. Or they might have been way laid by someone looking to take something from them.  
From the little I know of Death Magic, not to mention any of the other dark stuff, a Witches blood could Turbo charge the fuck out of that shit. Don't ask me for specifics, because I don't have the first fucking clue why. But you drop some of that stuff into your ritual, and boom, if you know what you're doing, you just put some serious ass behind your mojo. That on its own might have been the killer's motive.  
  
The Miller's had friends and associates of course, but nobody we interviewed could tell us a thing. But they most likely wouldn't have told us if they knew.  
  
  
  
Wizards love their fucking secrets. I mean it's understandable. Especially from human wizards. This touches on that dangerous knowledge thing I was talking about earlier.  
No need to go advertising that you actually know the boogeyman’s real name. He might get pissed that you do. That sort of knowledge might get your intestines wrapped around a telephone pole.  
  
  
  
It's Jeff by the way. Don't tell anybody. That's dangerous information.  
  
  
  
Course all of this was beyond me. I wasn't going to be involved with the investigation. That's more of a homicide detective thing. Rolling up drunks and writing speeding tickets is more my thing. And besides, there was a pretty good chance we would never figure out what went down that night.  
You know that something like ninety five percent of murders go unsolved? Just the way things shake out. That shits no different in Bull's Heart. Hell, it's probably worse.  
  
  
  
You find some drifter crucified to a billboard a hundred feet up in the air, with his liver gnawed on, you'd think everyone would drop everything and try to figure that one out. Here in Bull's Heart? We just send up a couple of Stripers with some Fabuloso, and have them clean that shit up. If it never happens again, we consider that job jobbed.  
  
  
I mean you would be surprised how little evidence any given centuries old murder machine can leave behind.  
Now if we catch them in the act, we try and put a stop to that shit, don't get me wrong, but we can only do so much. I will say though, sometimes we catch a sloppy one and ride their asses into the ground.   
So aside from a few nightmares and a tingle up my spine whenever I heard a blackbird cawing in the dead of night, I figured my part in this was done for.  
  
  
I dropped my fork on my plate. My clean plate I might add. I was about to motion to the Striper busing tables that I needed my bill, when the door swung up.  
  
  
Deputy Daliwal slunk in, in all his tiger striped glory. He smiled when he saw me. I noticed He didn't show teeth when he did it. I briefly wondered if that was because he didn't want to appear threatening.  
  
  
  
Which.... I mean... good fucking luck.  
  
  
  
His eyes held genuine joy though. Seemed He was Really happy to see me still on this side of the long walk.  
  
  
  
"Colm!" He exuberated at me "I am happy to see you back on duty. I was.... worried for you. I came to visit, but you were sedated. I am so sorry I couldn't see you while conscious. I did try though" He was starting to babble in that way that the English do when they are uncomfortable   
  
  
  
"Man, don't sweat that shit" I said smiling up at him. "I'm just happy to see that you came out of that furball, no pun intended, on your feet."  
  
  
I motioned for him to pull up a chair and he nodded his head graciously, before taking the empty seat across from me.  
He spared a gaze over at Elle, across the room. She was dealing with a dissatisfied customer.  An Irate meat golem named Sheldon. Sheldon to put it mildly was a bit of a fucking Karen. Cunt might be an appropriate term as well, but I'm not Australian. I had reason to deal with the guy on occasion. The sort of dude that calls the cops on kids playing too loudly in the park. Just a grumpy old fuck.  
Sheldon was mad about some such non-sense, that probably didn't matter. I can't remember what it was that had him so peeved and I don't really give shit.  
  
  
"Think you might have an opportunity to score some boyfriend points there..." I told the burly Rakshashan deputy.  
  
  
I had a notion that he might have had a thing for Miss Ellie. My take of him was that he was a stand-up fella, so I didn't have a problem encouraging him to pursue that.  
  
  
"You think so?" He asked absent mindedly running a hand down his beard.  
  
  
"I reckon so." I responded, "Don't hang back on my account."  
  
He stood up from his chair. He took a moment to look down at his uniform, making sure it looked good. He squared his shoulders and set his sights on Ellie and the bickering Meat Golem.  
  
  
"Right" he said like billions of determined Englishmen before him had, right before getting down to business.  
  
  
He was interrupted by a Minotaur crashing through the front window. Well not just a Minotaur. About four people, humans by the look of them, were hanging off of him. I recognized the Minotaur. It was my good friend Bubba Ray.  
  
  
I was on my feet in an instant, wondering what kinda stomp knocking jackasses would decide to pick on a guy like Bubba. Dude being built like a Greek Shit house aside, he was a total sweetheart.  
  
"I'LL END YOUR FUCKING BLOODLINE, DEMON!" Bubba Ray bellowed as he wrapped his massive hands around the ribs of one of his attackers and slammed the man face first into one of his horns. The horn in question driving into the man's face, til the gore slicked point protruded from the back of his head. The attacker went limp, and rag dolled as Bubba swung his head around, before the body tore free from the head and went flying across the small diner.  
  
That was the sort of shit you saw on a death metal album cover from the 80s. But it gave his attackers no moment of pause, they pressed into him, hands tearing at his hide ripping bloody strips of flesh from the Minotaur.  
  
And no, that shouldn't have been possible. Normal folks can't go tearing into Minotaurs, thats just not how shit works.  
The Glock 40 MOS on my hip cleared leather and I was in a shooting stance. Ready to start splitting coconuts.  
  
"Everybody get on the fucking ground!" I yelled out of habit.  
  
Doubt Bubba Ray or his dance partners even heard me though, not over the noise of the fracas. Smashing glass and splintering furniture.  
But outside of that I was a bit stymied on options. I don't know if you ever seen a Minotaur fight three people tearing chunks out of his ass, but there are a lot of moving parts and damn near any of them could flatten you. Not to mention that we were in a crowded building, in which the 10MM 220 grain flat nose hunting rounds sitting in my Glock had the ability to murder about 55 percent of the patrons in the background, and the other 45 percent would be highly annoyed with me shooting them.  
  
Catch a hoof to the nuts or accidently shoot somebody trying to enjoy their omelet. Bad choices all around.  
  
Sidenote, if you visit Bull's heart, you have to have one of Earl's Omelets. Shits amazing. I wouldn’t think to deep on whats in them though. There is literally no telling.  
  
  
Bubba grabbed one of the six hands ripping at him, and jerked the hand so hard that he snapped the attacking man's arm clean in half at the elbow. He then reared back and swung the man's own arm at him like a Billy club.  
I'm not going to lie. That was one of the most hard-core things I've ever seen in my life.  
  
  
I looked over at Daliwal who also had that big, dumb, double barreled 1911 of his drawn down on the fight. He caught my eye and nodded at me. I nodded back and drew my Asp. With a flick of my wrist, I had twenty six inches of titanium 'bitch be good' at my disposal.  
We advanced on the fight shouting commands to turn off the shenanigans.  
  
Bubba ray glanced our way and bellowed  
  
"Fellas, I’m tryna stop fighting" He drawled over at us, pain bleeding out of his words. "These sons a bitches won't let me!"  
  
I brought my stick down on the shoulder of one of Bubba's attackers. I felt something break in his collar bone, but that didn't seem to bother him none. He went stiff, like he just realized that Bubba Ray wasn't the only person in the universe. He slowly turned to meet me head on. His gaze met mine from beneath the shaggy mop of brown hair on his head.  
  
"Aw shit" I grunted.  
  
The man's eyes were those of a corpse. No light lit up the windows to his soul. I took a step back. The corpse looked like it had once been a man, roughly mid to late twenties. Drifter by the look of him. But that had been some time ago. Gore and grime covered his face. Grass and mud matted his hair to his head. His sunken cheeks were red with Bubba Ray's blood.  
  
Fucking Zombies.  
  
The Deadman’s lips started to move. As if he was trying to remember how to speak. After a moment air started to wheeze past those split and crack pale lips. It wasn’t long before those wheezes started to sound like words.  
  
"The...." he whispered "..... Master...."  
  
"Ohhhhh......don't you fucking say it." I nearly growled.  
  
"....Comes...."  
  
"Oh you fucking said it" I said in a suddenly foul mood. I brought the tip of my baton down in an overhanded swing, smacking right into the temple of the dead man. I felt bone break revibrating up the titanium baton. As the dead man made like a tree and fell the fuck over.  
  
"Daliwal, They're fuckin' dead." I hollared out. "This one just told me that his master was coming too."  
  
"I heard...." Daliwal said, a sigh flavoring his words. "I knew it was a bloody Necromancer....."  
  
"Gonna be a long ass night" I said bringing the Asp down again on the fallen zombie's head. It seemed like the first strike had done the job. But a double tap is never not a good idea.  
  
"Quite" He said reaching for his radio.  
  
Bubba Ray finished off the last zombie by grabbing it's head and squeezing ‘til it cracked open. Black decayed brain matter hitting the floor with a wet 'sclop' sound. Bubba threw the corpse down, where it landed on the tile in a heap of dead flesh.  
  
"Jen..." Daliwal said into his radio. "Romeo Sierra. Priority."  
  
"Romeo Sierra go ahead" Jen's voice crackled out of his and my Radio.  
  
"10-37 at Earl's. Do be a dear and send EMS as well. Subject is a male Minotaur approximately twenty six hundred years of age, severe trauma caused by what appear to be zombies, no earthly idea of what kind.  Four down, unknown if anymore remain in vicinity."  
  
  
"Roger that, Romeo Sierra. I will get EMS routed to you. Any call signs in the area, please movie to Earl's. Romeo Sierra is site commander until properly relieved. Please update as the situation develops. "  
  
  
Jen was routing all available back up to us, as Zombies tended to a big concern to those of us trying to keep a lid on things. Bastards were a walking virus, and unless you cut them all out, they could pop up down the line and fuck up your whole day. Jen had designated Deputy Daliwal as the site commander, not out of any deference, but simply because he was the guy on scene with the radio and a clearly cool head. As soon as someone who had better training on the issue or more experience with the subject matter arrived, they would take over.  
  
"Roger that, Jen. Romeo copies all."  
  
Ellie ran out of the kitchen holding dish towels. Her face looked slightly frantic as She ran straight for Bubba Ray, who was now sitting at a table. He was bleeding profusely from where the Zombies had torn into him.  Ellie popped one of her claws and ran it down the back of Bubba's Texans Jersey, slitting it open to show off the bloody wounds on Bubba's body.  
  
"Miss Ellie" Bubba said with a bit of pain in his voice "Why you tryna get me naked.... I'm a married man...."  
  
"Oh hush up, Bubba Ray Minos.... I used to change your damn diapers."  Ellie said, brushing the attempt at humor aside as she went to work on him.  
  
I grabbed a towel from Ellie and pressed it into a particularly nasty gash on Bubba's enormous Bicep. He looked rough. The zombies had chewed him up something good. I didn't think that a Minotaur could catch Zombism from human undead. But he could still bleed to death. At least I think he could.  
  
"You're gonna be alright, Old man" I said "Queenie (Bubba's wife) would kick your ass if you died before EMS got here, you know that right?"  
  
  
"Yeah" Bubba Ray said with a chuckle "I reckon she would. Especially if it were dead humans what laid me down."  
  
  
I looked around at everyone else in the dinner. People were starting to clear out. But there were still a few looky-loos staying planted in their chairs, enjoying the free show.  
  
Earl's snout was peeking out of the kitchen window. His crocodilian eyes held about as much concern as a former Reptilian god of war's eyes could hold, but it was there if you knew where to look.  
  
  
He hissed at his latest striper to get his attention.  
  
  
"Grab a towel..." His drowned man's voice warbled at the confused young dirtball "...and make yourself useful for once, Ezekiel. We have a customer in need, and the dining room looks shoooooody"  
  
  
This Striper had a little bit of stronger instinct for self-preservation than Marcel had had. He got his ass in gear pretty quick. He almost moved over to Miss Ellie to help out. But than realized, his waking nightmare had become a zombie movie, and the biggest guy in the room had just had his ass torn up by zombies. So he made for the broom closet. Probably safer to sweep up glass, rather than get close to the giant Bull man. My eyes fell to his patch. Torture killer. Might have been why he wasn’t flipping the hell out. He was used to blood and guts.  
  
  
"Colm" Daliwal said "Can you grab the trauma kit from your vehicle, please"  
  
  
"On it" I said, moving towards the door. Keeping an eye on the twice dead men splayed out on the floor. Goes without saying that I wasn't even going to try and resuscitate one of them, but I was damn going to keep an eye on them of course.  
  
  
You never know what kind of zombies you are getting. At first.  
  
  
I paused dead in my tracks in the doorway.  
  
"Oh fiddle shits" I whispered when I got a look out into the night. I leaned back into the Diner. My pistol clearing leather again.  
"Hey Daliwal, we got a fucking problem out here. Looks like somebody just emptied a fucking graveyard on our doorstep"  
  
  
Bodies, A lot of them, were stumbling our way through the parking lot. They all had that unblinking silent stare that the recently risen dead had.  And all of those stares seemed to be aimed my way.  It was odd. The few other times I had dealt with dead things, they had had the decency to make some sort of noise to let me know they were coming. These assholes were completely silent though. Quiet as the grave. Just dead flesh slithering it's way through the moonlight.  
  
  
"Well" I said as I raised my pistol. "Thats okay... I'll make enough noise for all of us."  
  
The Zombies just stared at me.  
  
"Sorry" I said "That sounded better in my head."  
  
I opened fire.
