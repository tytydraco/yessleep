I found a dead body in my trunk today.

The scorching Florida sun bore down on me as I lounged on my porch, savoring the warmth seeping into my skin. It was a fleeting moment of serenity amidst the chaos of life. With my girlfriend off on errands and my best friend Rob gallivanting on one of his impromptu road trips, solitude enveloped me like a comforting blanket.

But the tranquility shattered with a sudden intrusion—a vile stench permeating the air, assaulting my senses. Initially, I brushed it off as the all-too-familiar odor of roadkill that often plagued our neighborhood. Yet, this scent was different, more sinister, creeping into my consciousness with a tenacity that demanded attention.

With furrowed brows and a growing sense of unease, I succumbed to the call of curiosity, following the odor's trail to my car. Each step was fraught with anticipation, the air thickening with foreboding. As I neared the vehicle, a knot formed in the pit of my stomach, a primal instinct warning of impending danger.

With trembling hands, I popped open the trunk, and a gust of stifling heat enveloped me, mingling with the noxious fumes within. In the dim light, shadows danced ominously, concealing the horrors that lay hidden. Half-expecting to find the grim remnants of our drunken escapade. What greeted me inside, however, was far worse than anything I could have imagined. Nestled amidst the spare tire and assorted junk was a lifeless body of a young boy, his pallid skin tinged with a sickly blue hue.

I stared in utter horror as the memories from the previous night flooded back with horrifying clarity. Rob and I had been drinking, as we often did when we found ourselves alone. But this time, things had spiraled out of control – a blur of alcohol-fueled recklessness that ended with the deaths of two innocent teenagers. The weight of my guilt pressed down on me like a suffocating blanket, threatening to crush me beneath its burden.

Shock rippled through me as I recoiled in horror, bile rising in my throat. Rob and I had crossed a line we could never uncross, and now, we were left to face the consequences of our actions.

But as I stared at the singlular body in the trunk, a sense of dread settled over me like a thick fog. Where was the other teenager? I know there was two, I remember. What had happened to him? Panic surged through me as I realized the gravity of the situation. There’s only two possibilities I can think of. Either he was still alive and escaped by himself, or someone had come and taken his body away and out of the trunk.

And then, in a rush of clarity, even more memories came flooding back – the screams of the teenagers, the sickening thud as their bodies hit the ground. It was all too much to bear, a tidal wave of guilt and despair crashing down on me with relentless force.

With a trembling hand, I reached for my phone, fingers fumbling as I dialed Rob's number. With each ring, my heart pounded louder in my chest, a nagging sense of dread gnawing at my insides. When he finally answered, my voice came out in a shaky whisper.

“Rob,” I stammered, “I need you to come to my place. Now.”

I could tell he was going to argue, since he’s so far away now, but then the memories hit him the same way they hit me a moment ago.

Silence hung heavy on the line, broken only by the rapid thudding of my pulse in my ears. Then, Rob's voice, cool and composed, pierced the stillness.

“Stay inside,” he instructed, his tone betraying none of the panic swirling inside me. “I'll be there soon.”

As I retreated into the safety of my house, the weight of my guilt bore down on me like a leaden weight, threatening to crush me beneath its burden. And as I waited for Rob's arrival, I knew that nothing would ever be the same again.
