Paul was a single father. Ever since his wife Evelyn passed away a year ago the mood in the small apartment became stale. He and his 6-year-old son George gradually exchanged fewer and fewer words. Sometimes Paul would try to start a conversation, asking "Hey George'y, how was school?" or "How's ya dinner?". He usually got little more than a faint groan or unintelligible mumble in response. Eventually, he learned to accept the silence. Many nights would pass and George wouldn't so much as look up at his father.

One rainy night after Paul had tucked George into bed, kissed him, and told him everything would be alright, he decided to complete some overdue work. He was halfway through an email when he thought he heard something. After shifting his headphones to listen for the noise he realized it was his neighbor. He had complained several times to the landlord about these loud, annoying tenants. Often they kept him awake all night only for Paul to get scolded by his boss for being late again the next morning. Nothing was ever done about the tenants.

As Paul cursed to himself hoping these dickheads would shut up before he headed to bed, he heard another sound, a song, it was softer and coming from somewhere else. At first, it sounded like a soft backing track sifting into his mind. The tune grew louder; ðŸŽ¶doo dodo do dooðŸŽ¶, he rehearsed this mentally before making out some words and realizing it was "Singing in the Rain" from that old musical. The sound was distant and crackly, yet somehow he distinctly heard it over the neighbor's bass-filled, booming music. He tried to pinpoint where it was coming from before locking his gaze on the open window. The curtain swayed softly in the wind, beckoning him over.

He gave in to curiosity and walked over toward the sound. Paul scanned the empty street searching for the source of the eerie music. It took him a while, his eyes adjusting to the dark. It was likely just some drunk homeless person who'd gotten their hands on an old radio or something, nevertheless, Paul stayed at the window a need to know the source rooting him in place. Just as he began to give up and turn around a small figure dressed in a black trench coat and a vintage hat nimbly tap-danced around the corner of the apartment block, he was spinning in circles while spinning an umbrella to the tune. The music grew louder as the man elegantly danced along the side of the apartment block, seemingly unbothered by the rain. Despite a deep pit forming in Paul's stomach, he continued to track the figure as he traversed the street, wrapped around the other corner, and was out of sight.

It was only after the man was gone that Paul noticed a couple of strange things. The man danced incredibly well, tapping his feet and soles at incredible speed to the tune, flinging the umbrella and spinning elegantly. The dancing was far too good for some drunk. Paul was seemingly frozen in place from the moment the man appeared dancing happily around the corner until he disappeared again, his neighbor's loud bass faded into the background despite it being much louder and closer than whatever speaker or radio the man had. That was the other thing, as far as Paul could see the man had no device that could emanate sound the way he had heard it. The song sounded crackled and strangely distorted as if it were coming from some vintage radio, the man certainly wasn't singing, was he? He couldn't have been there were instruments playing. It was weird that's for sure, but Paul just blamed his tiredness on the strangeness of the incident and went to bed shortly after knowing he'd be yelled at by his boss the next morning for not completing his work.

Paul slept restlessly that night, suprisingly the neighbor actually turned the music down. He had dreams of being frozen in place on the street as the man danced toward him at speed the tune accelerating along with his movement, growing more and more distorted and accompanied by a wide smile plastered across his face. Rain pelted against Paul's back as he helplessly stood there waiting for his demise as the man sped toward him. Waking with a start Paul checked the time: 4:34 am, he lay awake for the rest of the night. The next morning life continued as usual, silently eating breakfast with George, dropping him at school and then forcing himself to face his horrible boss. One thing stood out that day, as Paul scrolled through his phone his eye caught a headline "CHILD REPORTED MISSING". The location of the report was in the area of the apartment. The police had no leads and were pleading anyone with potentially useful information to come forward. Halfway through the article Paul's boss tapped him on the back and snarkily told him to get back to work. That evening Paul decided to inform the police of the strange man he had seen. He recounted the experience to the receiver but emphasized that he was tired and his recount probably wasn't 100% accurate, they told him it was likely unrelated but they'd take his story into account anyway as they had nothing else to go on.

Weeks passed and not much seemed to happen, still no sign of the missing kid. One detective let slip to the press that "it was as if the little fella just up and dissapeared". Paul became more protective of George, making sure the apartment was securley locked at night along with all the windows. Another couple of weeks went by and the fear of another abduction became little more than a lingering thought.

That's when it happened... Paul had just begun to let down his guard until one night he had a strange dream. It was hazy but he remembered the distinct sound of the song- "ðŸŽ¶*Singing in the Ra*in,Â *just singin' in the rain, What a glorious feeling, I'm happy agai*nðŸŽ¶". As he woke up the song didn't dissipate with the rest of the dream., it grew louder. Once he was fully awake a feeling of dread set in. Somehow he just knew something was wrong, that man had done something. A sudden urge to check on George came over him. The window in the small lounge was wide open, this was strange as Paul had definitely closed and locked it the night before. Every step toward his son's room felt heavier than the last, he became light-headed, but fainting wasn't an option, he needed to know his son was okay. To Paul's horror, Georges doow was eerily opened, it knocked against the wall as the breeze entering through the window flowed in. It took all his effort to peer around the door frame. Paul's heart stopped. His son. Was gone. The song continued to play in the background as Paul regained composure and frantically searched the bedroom. The blanket was strewn to one side, the window open wide and the curtain swayed gently in the breeze. No sign of George.

"It's okay," Paul said to himself "Maybe he was just hot, opened all the windows and went into the kitchen to get some water, its fine" but the kitchen was vacant along with the rest of the apartment and the hallway leading to the elevators. At this point Paul called the police, barely able to keep it together he told the receiver what had happened, several grudgey tenants stood at their doors wondering what the commotion was about, but right now Paul couldn't care less. Five minutes later an officer showed up to Paul's apartment door. The officer had to let himself in because Paul wouldn't answer the door. He was broken down on the bed, head in hands cussing to himself. He was informed that a search party had been formed and was actively searching for George, somehow this gave him little relief. Barely audibly Paul asked the officer if he heard that awful song that was still coming from the window. The officer gave him a blank, confused stare, Paul got up and ran to his neighbor's door and knocked radically. As soon as a frowning middle-aged man opened the door he blurted out "Do you hear it? That horrible rain song?", "What song? Go back to bed for fuck sake it's 2 am!" the man said before turning and slamming the door shut.

Shortly after a detective showed up at the door and asked permission to search the apartment for signs of break-in or other clues, Paul obliged. As it turned out the case was very similar to the one from a month and a half ago. George had simply vanished. No leads whatsoever.

Days, weeks, and eventually months passed with no sign of George. The case became cold with nothing to go off, and the detective's communication with Paul about their progress lessened. As for Paul, days seemingly melted together, he was fired because of a lack of attendance at the office and Paul was forced to beg for money from his parents whilst he applied for as many jobs as he could. Eventually, he was accepted at a fast food chain and a job as a night janitor at a local mall. Working close to 60 hours a week Paul began to question the value of his life, he fell into a deep pit of depression and grief but couldn't afford therapy. He had to start renting a cheaper apartment, he didn't see this as a bad thing. He was leaving behind the horrible memories attached to the old apartment. He was on the verge of another breakdown when something unexpected happened.

It was George, nearly a year had passed since his disappearance. It seemed like all hope was lost and yet, there he was. Some kind strangers found him wandering around a few streets over and called the police when they realized he was alone. The police then took him to the station where he was identified as George Lynch, son of Paul Lynch. Paul was called to meet his son at the station and both were questioned. It was strange. The only thing George would talk about was how lovely it was to sing and dance in the rain. It was the only response he gave. The detective would ask "Hey buddy, how'd you end up at Albert Street?" and he would answer " Isn't the rain just lovely? I love singing in the rain!". After an hour or so of questions and a medical checkup, George was allowed home with Paul under the condition that he saw a therapist twice a week.

As it turned out therapy did next to nothing for George. Some nights Paul would wake in a panic, hearing that tune that he despised so much coming from the room over. It was George, sitting on the edge of his bed staring out his wide-open window at the rain singing softly to himself, "ðŸŽ¶*Singing in the Ra*in,Â *just singin' in the rain, What a glorious feeling, I'm happy agai*nðŸŽ¶". Paul would rush into his room lock the window securely close the curtain and usher him back to bed. This happened for countless nights. times were similar to how they used to be in a way, driving George to school every morning mostly in silence, eating meals mostly in silence, and overall a stale mood in the now smaller apartment. As little as George did talk, his only talking about loving the rain slowly drove Paul insane.

One night Paul couldn't bear it any longer. Paul had woken up once again to the patter of rain accompanied by the tune sung by George. Emotions took over, Paul marched into George's room, "PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SHUTUP!!, I CAN'T DO THIS ANY LONGER!, STOP SINGING THAT FUCKING SONG!!". He was so overwhelmed that he slammed the window shut, drew the curtain, and slammed his fist into the wall. "But Papa" came George's calm sterile voice "The rain's amazing, don't you love singing in the rain?" "NO I DON'T GO TO SLEEP AND STOP. FUCKING. SINGING!". At this point, George stood up and walked toward the window, and Paul let loose. He picked the boy up and dumped him back into bed, he accidentally hit George's head on the bed frame hard enough to make him wail. Paul instantly broke into tears, "I'm sorry!, I just, I just can't!" he sat hugging George in his bed for what seemed like an eternity before blacking out. The last thing he remembered was a blue uniform standing above the bed.

Apparently one of the tenants had called the police about the commotion. Paul awoke in the police car briefly before blacking out again out of pure exhaustion. He had worked another ten-hour shift managing the restaurant along with three hours cleaning at the mall. When he finally woke properly he was sat in a small room with no windows. It didn't take him long to realize he was in a holding cell. Ten minutes later a man dressed in a suit walked in and kindly greeted Paul. he informed him George was currently at a medical center and that he had a concussion. After this, he proceeded to question Paul about the night's events.

Before long he was found guilty of child abuse. It was concluded that he was mentally unstable and was sent to a mental ward, where he would spend as much time as necessary until he was deemed healthy. Paul couldn't believe how quickly his life had flipped again. He no longer had custody of George (who had been sent to a foster home) and was stuck in a facility for the mentally ill. The mental ward didn't seem to do much for him, often he had breakdowns claiming he could hear a horrible rain song coming from the window.

Two passed with Paul not making much progress. The song still regularly haunted him. One time he claimed to have seen the strange man tap dancing In the rain just outside his room window, the song playing in that old crackled and distorted radio tone. Regularly he would get reports on George, who was still the same. Barley was talking and when he did it would always be about the rain. Paul received a call from the police station around this time. George was gone. Again. It was very similar to the last disappearance, no leads, no sign of forced entry. Just gone.

After this, years passed. George didn't show up again this time. Eventually, Paul was released and he moved back to England to live with his parents whilst he got back on his feet. For the first time in a very long time, Paul began to forget his past trauma, he was happy. Shortly after he secured a job as an assistant manager at a restaurant and he moved into a new apartment, A couple of months went by. Paul was doing better than ever, he had a new girlfriend, a stable job lived near his family, it was great.

Paul and his girlfriend Freia were sitting down to watch a movie one rainy night when Paul heard it. It was faint and crackly like always but very clear, and the voice. The voice had certainly changed, even through the usual distortion it sounded... younger, "ï¿½*ï¿½What a glorious feelin', I'm happy again, I'm laughin' at clouds so dark up abov*eðŸŽ¶. Fear and flashbacks consumed Paul, and almost unwillingly he gradually stood up and moved toward the open window, the curtain swaying gently in the wind. He cast his gaze down toward the street below. "Honey, everything okay?" came Freia's soft voice, he didn't respond. Just then a small figure far below tap danced nimbly around the corner. It was a young man dressed in a black trench coat and vintage black hat. Paul watched as the figure danced their way across the sidewalk, then for a split second the man looked directly up at Paul, straight into his eyes. As the man smiled crazily up Paul could have sworn the eyes he saw locked on his were those of his son George.

That night a young boy went missing, no trace, no leads for the police. Just gone.
