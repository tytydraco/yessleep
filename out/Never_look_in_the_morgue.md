Hello you can call me soldier this is my first story it happened a month ago and I’m somehow still processing this.

I live in a town in Vermont a small town nice schools nice people. I have a friend named Carlos he’s a weird kid I think he has autism when people greet him when he is not looking at them he freezes and does some sort of pose I will never forget him blaming me for slapping him and my dad taking me to the police station screaming at me as a 8 year old this scared the crap outta me. I’m 16 now high school is great Carlos is a year younger than me so I basically have to look after him because he’s so weird. My mother was tired of me playing video games all the time her and Carlos mom made us go on hikes on Monday’s every Monday we venture through town looking at things like a hidden house behind a football field a creek next to a pond a castle on a hill on that pond and more until this event happened. 

I learned from some people a famous author lived in my town for a short period of time then died there also I heard that his grave is in the graveyard near my high school so I called up Carlos and made him go find the grave with me. We met up at his house not far from the graveyard and started looking after an hour we couldn’t find it but Carlos was determined and we went looking for another half hour until we stumbled upon some sort of white shack in the graveyard. I said go open it it’s probably unlocked, I was right he opened it and said dude this is a morgue I said no way you sure he said there are bodies in here with black sheets on top of them this must be a morgue.

I didn’t believe him at first because he has autism and might be faking but I looked inside and saw exactly what he said I turned around and prayed to some family members who are buried in the same graveyard begging for forgiveness for this. He shut the door and we walked home that night I got a call from him saying that something is going on in his house his things were moving on it’s own. I said your’e faking Carlos but he showed me a video of a toy moving on its own I was shocked I thought ghosts weren’t real then I heard him scream at something saying go away! Then I heard things rumbling and him screaming I hang up on him thinking it was a joke. 

The next day at school I found him in my science class he looked white as a ghost and I asked him did the ghost find you? he said yes and said a ghost attacked him and I guess in his words tried to possess him. I looked at him and said Carlos nothing happened the ghosts are fake he grabbed my arm and looked at me with the most soulless eyes and said “never look in the morgue”
