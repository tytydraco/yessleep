I was drinking my coffee as I was looking through my wedding pictures,I got married 3 weeks ago and the pictures finally came in.but in one of the pictures I saw a girl wearing a red dress with long black hair that ended at her hips.it looked like my sister...but she's dead."no no it can't be her I'm imagine things"I say to myself.i called my mom and told her what happend but my mom said "it's probably just someone's kid that's looks like ur sister.i know u miss her but she's gone sweetie.u should take some rest".

I went to my bedroom and and took some rest.after a few hours,i woke up at 5pm.i showered and wore a bathing rope and stepped outside as I saw the picture with the girl on my bed.i thought my husband came home so I went downstairs calling for him "Lucas!....Lucas?are u downstairs?"
Hm..he wasn't home.then how did the picture get there?did someone break in while I was showering?

I searched the entire house but didn't find anyone.i didn't think much of it and made some coffee to clear up my mind from all this nonsense.after a few hours,it's 7pm and my husband comes home.
He hugged me and went to shower.but he called me upstairs.i went upstairs to him as I saw him staring at that picture...with the girl in it."who's this?" Lucas asked."I don't know,dear.but she looks like my sister with her long hair and her favourite colour,red.and she's wearing a red dress" Lucas looked at me with a serious expression and said "ur right.it does look like ur sister,maybe it is" I laughed it off

"How could it be?" I said. "U know that I put on the invitation that kids under the age of 13 cannot be brought"Lucas said.the girl in the picture is atleast 9....like my sister.we brushed it off thinking someone didn't follow the rules and brought they're kid with them.as my husband went to shower I heard a knock.but it wasn't from the living room.it was from the mini door in my big closet.this is a new house so we didn't really go through that door yet.

I walked closer to it as I stepped on something hard.it was a red crayon,I thought the previous owners had kids and they left this.i crouched down and opened the door and went in with my phone flash light opened.i saw something on a chair right Infront of me.i flashed my light to see the red dress that the girl in the picture was wearing.

There was something written in the walls aswell,I shined my flashlight to the walls.it said "I miss u pinky"

Pinky?.....that's the nickname my sister used to call me.nobody else knows that name except her..

I quickly shut the door and threw the crayon in the room aswell.my husband came out and asked if everything's alright as my face was full of fear.i said everything's alright and never told anyone about this thing again.

We still live in the same house and everytime I go to bed.i get goosebumps.
