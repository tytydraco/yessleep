let me start off by saying my name is Jack landa and this will be the last time anyone ever hears of me once they find me they will kill me for what i know for what i am saying now there will be no evdence of me ever existing i will be forgotten... let me start over im losing my thoughts who knows how much longer i have before they find me my name is Jack landa 26 male first lieutenat of the united states miltary

 two years ago feb of 2021 i was asked to particapate in a project for a bonus of 2,000 dollars I accepted the offer without asking questoins or even thinking twice about how this could affect me i wish i could tell myself to stop say no its not worth it but the past is past its to late to change it i was givin the orders to arrive merrit feild air staiton in beaufort south carolina by feb 18 of 2021

 and not to tell anyone of this change not even my family as ordered i did as said and arrived at feb 18 merrit airfeild 2021 apon arriving to the base i was met by a captin john white who was to lead in this mission at this point i was curois on what this missoin was when i asked captin white he responded with "that is classifed up tell the very mission"

 at this point i had a growing feeling something was off but i shrugged it off he procced to tell me to get ready to meet the rest of the sqaud whos names were as follows "private mikey, second private josh, and corpral anthonay'' 

they were to arrive the very next day so get some rest he showed to me to the barrakes where we would be sleeping 4 sets of bunk beds side by side i walk in slowly with the old floor creaking beneat me i still rember that place so vividly so perfectly down to the last detail the gray walls the stained mattresses no thicker then a laptop... i can hear footsteps they are closing in on me i only have a bit left i must hurry i cant die with what i know not like the others... i set up my bed and soon went to sleep

 soon after i arose at o six hundred to meet my squad captin white called us out on by one by first name a bit odd for the miltary but sure jack, mikey, josh, anthony, he paused '''this seems to be it" he exclaimed ''no matter i am captin white and i will be leading you on this mission what missoin that is it is best not to know'' a deep gut feeling set in right there thats when i first started to regret my desion to join this missoin ''we have to weeks to get ready for it we will wake up every morning tell then i will be training you in everything you need to know to survive is that understood'' "SIR YES SIR" we responded in unisoin captin white contuined "very good today we start by going to the range to test out you sharpshoting" he starts to walk away saying "follow me"

 we procced to go the range for the next 3 days starting when we wake up by the fourth day we are all wondering why we are here josh becomes curois enough to ask captin white who responds with "the time will come when you can know" another alarm goes off in my head but i already accepted the missoin so its to late to back out the next morning we wake up at o six hundred once again expacting to go to the range but we were soon told that our missoin has been moved up and we go in two days

 captin white looks worried about this we are all stressed do to this esspecly since we still dont know the mission captin white stands up and says "follow me boys" we follow him to a big white room in the middle of the base its all but blank but on the far wall there is a holw in the wall but not a normal hole this was about 5 feet in height and 4 feet in diamter and it didnt lead anywhere it was just pitch darkness inside it captin white with a grave expressoin said "boys this is the missoin this is what we belive to be a portal to a diffrent world we want you to explore it as it may be where covid 19 virus organted"

 we all staterd in shock he wasnt serios was he? could he be? thats not even possible is it? "boys get to bed tommorow we go in" suffeice to say no one slept we woke early to the sound of a horn we walked to the big white room from yesterday there were men and woman in lab coats all around it when we walked into the room we were told to put on hazmat suits for saftey reasons we did as told we were armed with the classic m 16 with a flashlight and knife straped to the end

 captin white stood in front of us all and said i will never forget "if you are lost we will not come back for you you will be left for dead whatever we see over there do not let it touch you" he turned his back to use and walked in i followed soon after i was halfway through when i heard anothony scream out from behind me "i cant do it" a woman in a white coat screamed as he rose the barrel and shot himself in the head

 she was covered in the blood of him her still screaming was careid away from the rest of the body by two others im still in shock when captin white came back through to our side and said "come on" we had no choice but to follow him

 in i walked through the hole and i see a black goo all over the place a dark tar looking subsatnce that seemed to bubble up and spew out "WHATS THAT" screamed mikey "back to back" yelled captin white we gathered in a tight circle back to back guns out ready for whatever and then i see it a dark figure covered in goo almost human like with no face but red beaty eyes that seemed to follow as it ran from tree to tree

 ba-ba-ba josh fires his gun into the beast but all it does is upset it the beast makes a unearthly scream a scream so shrill it coulb break glass "ahhhhh" joshs gun hits the ground with little more then a thud as he is dragged of into the tree line captin white yells"GO RUN" 

at that very moment there seems to be a milloin eyes come from the trees captin fired his gun into the trees to buy time and then i see it clearly it jumps from the tree onto the captin and tears him to shreds nothing but screams echo me and the monster lock what i think are is its eyes and i see it it has a thousand lives all at once in that moment what i saw i can only describe as humantiy all the fear, horror, and voloince of humantiy in on thing i felt sorry for it sympthetic for it i wanted to embrace him tell hims its ok 

it shreiks a foul shreik that brings me back mikey yells "RUN" as he fires his gun it jumps farther then anything else on earth it grabs him by the throath mikeys last breaths are spent fighting kicking punching just for it to crush his skull in on swift movement i still rember that night sadly no one else will once i made it back they held me her for 2 years i have finally escaped from my cell when the creature escaped its containment when they catch me i will die and so will all of this enless YOU keep the memory alive of mikey captin josh and anothany and soon me good bye world do rember us rember 




that was my first ever one give some advice pls cause it kinda sucks i think
