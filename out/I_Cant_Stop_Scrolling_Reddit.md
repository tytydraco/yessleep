It started innocently enough. I was never a big social media person, but Reddit seemed different. It wasn’t about showing off or keeping up with friends; it was about information, stories, humor. It was like peeking into the minds of millions of people, all sharing their thoughts, experiences, and curiosities. I started slow—just a few minutes here and there, checking in during lunch breaks or when I was winding down at night.

It wasn’t long before Reddit became a habit. A routine. I’d wake up in the morning and reach for my phone, scrolling through r/worldnews before even getting out of bed. By the time I got to work, I was already deep into r/AskReddit or r/TodayILearned, my mind buzzing with random facts and opinions. I’d scroll through threads about “What’s the dumbest thing you believed as a kid?” or “People who have been in a coma, what’s it like to wake up?” Harmless stuff. Just a little distraction to pass the time.

But that little distraction started to take over.

I found myself losing track of time. I’d get home from work, planning to cook dinner or watch a movie, but instead, I’d sink into the couch and start scrolling. Before I knew it, hours had passed, and the sky outside had turned dark. My stomach would growl, but I’d ignore it, too engrossed in a thread about “What’s something you didn’t know was weird until you grew up?” or “What’s the worst date you’ve ever been on?”

I stopped cooking. Stopped exercising. Stopped doing anything, really. My evenings blurred together, one endless scroll through Reddit, one post after another. I wasn’t even reading them half the time, just skimming titles, clicking links, and refreshing the page over and over again. It wasn’t about finding something interesting anymore; it was just about keeping my thumb moving.

My friends started to notice. They’d message me, ask if I wanted to hang out, go for a drink, catch up. I’d see the notifications pop up, but I couldn’t bring myself to respond. They’d call, their names flashing on my screen, but I’d let it ring until it stopped. I’d tell myself I’d get back to them later, but later never came.

Work was the next thing to suffer. I was always tired, dragging myself out of bed after staying up until 3 or 4 AM, scrolling through threads like “What’s the most mundane fact that blew your mind?” or “What’s your most embarrassing moment?” I’d arrive at the office late, bleary-eyed, and unable to focus. My mind was always somewhere else, stuck in the endless loop of posts and comments, memes and upvotes.

Emails went unanswered. Deadlines slipped by. My boss started giving me worried looks, dropping hints that I needed to get my act together. But even as the pressure mounted, I couldn’t stop. My phone was always in my hand, my thumb swiping up, up, up, even during meetings, even while I was supposed to be working. I was like a robot, going through the motions, my mind somewhere else entirely.

Eventually, I started working from home—well, that’s what I told myself, anyway. The truth was, I just stopped going to the office. I’d send an email in the morning, telling them I wasn’t feeling well, then spend the day on the couch, scrolling Reddit. My apartment became a mess. Dishes piled up in the sink, dirty laundry covered the floor, and the smell of old takeout filled the air. I didn’t care. All that mattered was the next post, the next thread, the next little hit of distraction.

My family started to worry. My mom would call, leaving voicemails asking if I was okay, if I needed anything. My sister sent texts, begging me to call her back, asking if I was still alive. I’d see the messages, feel a pang of guilt, but I’d brush it aside. I’ll call them later, I’d think. Just one more post first.

The lines between day and night blurred. I’d wake up not knowing what time it was, unsure if I’d actually slept or if I’d just been dreaming of scrolling Reddit. It all felt the same—one continuous, endless scroll. My dreams became indistinguishable from reality. I’d see threads in my sleep, endless lines of text, snippets of conversations that looped over and over again.

I started to lose track of what was real. Sometimes I’d catch myself reading the same post twice, not realizing I’d already seen it hours before. Other times, I’d swear I’d read something only to find that it didn’t exist, that I must have imagined it. The content all started to blur together, one giant, never-ending Reddit page.

I didn’t leave my apartment for days at a time. The outside world didn’t seem to matter anymore. Food was an afterthought, something I’d grab between threads, eating mindlessly while my eyes stayed glued to the screen. My body started to wither away. I could feel myself getting weaker, my clothes hanging looser on my frame, but I couldn’t bring myself to care.

And then, there were the times when the internet would cut out.

Those were the worst. The moments when my Wi-Fi would drop or my phone would die, and I’d be left alone, truly alone, with nothing but my own thoughts. The panic would set in almost immediately. I’d scramble to get my connection back, frantically trying to refresh the page, my heart racing, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps. Without Reddit, there was nothing—just a void, an emptiness that I couldn’t bear to face.

When the connection returned, I’d feel a wave of relief, a flood of dopamine that almost brought tears to my eyes. I’d dive back into Reddit, scrolling faster, desperate to fill the void, to push away the fear that I was losing my grip on reality.

The world outside became a distant memory. I started ignoring more than just friends and family. I stopped paying bills, stopped checking my mail. I couldn’t remember the last time I showered or even looked in the mirror. My reflection was a stranger to me, someone I didn’t recognize and didn’t care to know.

All that mattered was the next post, the next comment, the next thread. I couldn’t stop. I didn’t want to stop. But at the same time, I was terrified—terrified of what was happening to me, of the person I was becoming. Or maybe the person I had already become.

I’m scared. I know something’s wrong, that this isn’t normal, but I can’t break free. I’m trapped in this endless loop, this infinite scroll, and I don’t know how to get out. I’ve tried to quit, but I always come back. I always start scrolling again.

Please, if anyone’s reading this—if anyone out there can help—I need to stop. I need to get out. But I don’t know how.

I can’t stop scrolling Reddit.
