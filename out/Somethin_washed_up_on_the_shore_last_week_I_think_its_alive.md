Ain't sure who'll end up readin' this, or if anyone will.  
Maybe I just need to get the words out 'fore the tide takes the rest of me.

The sea's been creepin' closer these last few years.  
You can hear it at night--gnawin' at the pilin's, chewin' 'em down to gray splinters.

Down here, the fog don't roll in--it *settles* across the land.  
Presses on the world like a suffocatin' wet hand.  
Some mornin's it' so thick you can't tell sky from swamp, can't see the buoy floatin' twenty feet off the dock.

Feels like livin' at the edge o' the world, with *nothin'* beyond that wall o' gray.

Our little town's dyin'.  
Shrimp plant shut down last winter--post office followed soon after.  
Ain't nobody sendin' letters to this ol' backwater no more.  
Ol' Miss Maggie still lights her window come dusk, though ain't nobody stopped by in years.  
The rest done packed for Baton Rouge or Lafayette long ago.

Ain't much left here in Saint Odile but ghosts and old memories.  
The tide keeps eatin' what little's left, one day at a time.  
Us few still hangin' on--we were born here, and here's where we'll stay.  
'Til the sea swallows us too.

Even the egrets quit callin'.  
Maybe they heard somethin' I ain't.

I keep my skiff tied behind the bait shack, though I don't take her out much these days.  
The traps come up empty more often than not, and the harbormaster don't even bother takin' notes no more.  
Still, old habit digs in deep.  
Every dawn I walk down with a thermos of coffee, check the lines, and listen to that foghorn moanin' from the point.  
Used to sound mournful.  
Now it just sounds *tired.*

Every mornin' I walk the same stretch o' shore, pickin' through driftwood and busted crab pots for the stove.  
Most of it's nothin'--junk wood, old rope, bones of boats too tired to float.

But sometimes... sometimes I find stranger things.

One mornin' I spotted somethin' wedged 'tween the rocks.  
Looked like a chunk o' driftwood at first--dark, waterlogged, half-buried in the muck.  
When I kicked it loose, it clanged against the stone.  
Metal.

Heavier'n it looked, it was cold and slick as river rock.  
It was about the size of my hand.  
Didn't look rusted like scrap oughta be.  
Smooth. Polished.  
Veins crawlin' along its length like somethin' that used to be alive.

Told myself it was part of a motor, maybe a propeller housin'.  
But I ain't never seen one shaped like that.  
When I picked it up, it was warm to the touch—*too* warm for somethin' fished outta the Gulf.  
And underneath the warmth, there was a *pulse*.  
A slow, steady hum I could feel in my bones.

Can't rightly say why, but I brought it home.  
Felt... familiar somehow.  
Like I'd seen it in a dream.

Cleaned the muck off and set it by the window.  
Sunlight hit the metal just so, and I saw the words etched on the side, neat as machine work:

***DURATH / UNIT 1317-A / PROPERTY OF—***

The rest was gone, eaten by salt and time.

I left it sittin' on the mantle—that night, the hum filled the house.  
And my dreams... changed.

Weren't nightmares, not exactly.

I was standin' on the shoreline, starin' out over the black water.  
Waves lappin' against my bare feet.  
That low, thunderin' drone rollin' through the night.

Only it wasn't no foghorn.  
That slow, rhythmic vibration felt familiar.

Beneath the tide, a blue light bloomed—soft, shimmerin'.  
Then another. And another.  
'Til the whole damn Gulf was lit up like the stars had fallen from the sky.

I woke up before dawn, my feet cold and wet.  
Sand all over the floor, and a skull-splittin' headache.

Look, I know how it sounds, but I ain't crazy.

A few days later, another piece washed ashore.  
Smaller'n the first, shaped like a bent rib, black as old oil.  
It thrummed the same as the other, faint and low, and when I set it near the first piece, the sound deepened. Harmonized.

Wasn't no coincidence.  
Next mornin', I found another. Then another.

I had the same dream night after night.  
Black sea, blue lights. The bone-rattling hum.

Only... they weren't no dreams.

I started keepin' what I'd found in the shed out back, laid 'em out on the workbench like puzzle pieces.  
Couldn't make sense of it at first, but when I closed my eyes, I could *feel* the hum.

When I put the pieces together, they came *alive*.

Little threads that looked like electrical wirin' reached out n' pulled the two pieces together 'til they weren't two pieces no more, but one. Try as I might, I couldn't get them apart again.

Didn't take long 'fore the thing started takin' shape.  
It wasn't no motor, that much I can tell you. No pipes, no fuel lines.  
The insides glowed faintly, like the heart o a smolderin' ember.  
And then when I stepped close, I could feel it *breathin'* in time with the hum.

The hum's deeper now—steady as a heartbeat.  
Sometimes, when I'm sittin' quiet, I can feel mine beatin' right alongside it.

Last night, I dreamed again.  
The lights under the sea were closer this time—rising toward the surface like a thousand eyes openin' all at once.

And above it all, a voice. Low, calm, and big as the ocean itself.

It called to me—said my name.  
I couldn't look away.

That hum's been gettin' louder.  
Not in a way you'd notice right off, but it's everywhere now—buzzin' in the pipes, in the stove, even in my teeth when I drink my coffee.  
Sometimes I catch the radio flickerin' to life on its own, playin' a voice that ain't speakin' any language I know.

Then there's the sea—she don't smell right.  
Ain't brine nor rot, but somethin' else, like the air before a thunderstorm.  
Last night I saw lights movin' under the waves again. Brighter this time. Closer.  
And for a heartbeat, I could swear the fog pulsed in time with the hum.

Like it was alive.

The fog's thicker an' stays longer with every passing day.  
Ol' Miss Maggie says her pacemaker *sings* in harmony with the hum each night.

The hum's stronger now.  
Nothin' drowns it out no more—not the wind, not the foghorn, not even the storms that roll through these parts. The house shakes when it gets goin', almost like it's breathin'.

Last night, I dreamed I was standin' at the shoreline again, but it was different this time.  
The sky was black as pitch, thunder rumblin' out past the breakers.  
I was holdin' the machine—the thing I built without meanin' to, veins of blue light runnin' through it like blood. The sea was waitin' for me, wide and endless.

Then the lights rose up out of the deep.  
Hundreds of 'em, glowin' blue beneath the waves, risin' into the storm like stars fallin' in reverse.

Lightnin' cracked, and for a breath, I saw it hangin' over the water.  
Wasn't no ship. Wasn't no god, neither, but somethin' in between.  
A machine made of metal, sinew, and wire.  
Reachin' down with its cable tendrils that minded me of roots, or veins.

It wanted what I'd made.

I offered it freely.

I could neither refuse nor look away.

The blue light died, turnin' blacker'n pitch.  
Colors rippled 'cross its metal shell like oil on water.  
It *drank* *in* the starlight.  
The blackness around it deepened, thick as tar.

The hum rose, low and hungry, 'til it felt like the world itself was groanin'.  
I dropped to my knees, clutchin' my head.

And then the thing spoke.

Not in words, not the way folks talk, but through the otherworldly grindin' and churnin' of its own makin'—still, I understood three words:

***"RECONSTRUCT... HOST... RETURN."***

Three commandin' words, heavy and cold as iron.  
I screamed as they were burned into me like a brand.

When I came to, the hum was gone. The shed was empty.

Now, the silence feels wrong, and the fog never clears.  
The tide's gone out too far, and the sea's holdin' its breath.

I can still feel it callin' to me.  
I don't know how much longer I can resist.  
Soon, the tide'll swallow me too.

If you read this, don't ever come to Saint Odile.
