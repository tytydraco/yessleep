I’ve always been the outdoorsy type. Hiking, camping, backpacking it’s what I live for. So when I found a remote trail deep in the woods that no one seemed to talk about, I thought I had struck gold. I was wrong.



It started on a crisp autumn afternoon. The air was fresh, and the trees seemed to whisper as I walked deeper into the forest. The sun was setting, casting a golden hue on everything around me. That’s when I saw something strange out of the corner of my eye movement, but too quick to be a deer. I chalked it up to my imagination. I had been on the trail for hours, after all.



As night began to fall, I set up camp by a small clearing, the flickering flames of my fire doing little to ease the growing unease in my chest. That’s when I heard it a rustling in the underbrush, followed by a low growl.



I froze, trying to make sense of the sound. Then, through the shadows, it stepped into the clearing.



It was tall, easily over seven feet, with lanky limbs that twisted at unnatural angles. Its face was a horrific blend of a goblin and something else its eyes glowed faintly in the firelight, a sickly yellow that made my stomach churn. Its skin, mottled and stretched like old leather, hung loosely on its bones. It had the features of a skinwalker, but its movements so agile and animalistic suggested it was something much worse.



I stumbled back, almost knocking over my pack. The thing snarled, its mouth splitting open to reveal rows of jagged teeth. I couldn’t look away, frozen in terror. It took a step closer, its claws clicking against the rocks. That’s when I heard a voice, small but clear, coming from the darkness.



"Don’t move, human."



I turned, and there just beyond the treeline was a tiny figure, barely three feet tall. It was wearing a ragged cloak, and its long, hooked nose gleamed in the moonlight. A gnome.



“Stay still,” it repeated, its voice strangely calm. “It won’t hurt you if you don’t move.”



I was too terrified to speak. The skinwalker-goblin hybrid was only a few feet away now, its gaze fixed on me. I thought for sure I was about to die. But the gnome raised a tiny hand, and suddenly, the creature stopped, as if some unseen force held it back.



The gnome stepped into the clearing, slowly but confidently, and began chanting under its breath in a language I couldn’t understand. The skinwalker-goblin hybrid snarled, struggling against the invisible restraint. Slowly, the creature backed off, retreating into the shadows from which it had emerged.



The gnome turned to me, its eyes now soft but still wary. “Don’t go any deeper into the woods,” it said. “That thing hunts at night. It’s not a creature of the forest. It was made. A twisted thing. And if you stay here, it’ll come back.”



I didn’t need to be told twice. Without another word, I grabbed my pack and bolted, not stopping until I was back at the trailhead and in my car.



I haven’t gone near those woods since, but I’ve heard whispers about others who’ve gone in, and I know what’s waiting for them.



So, if you’re ever hiking deep in the woods and you hear something that doesn’t sound right, just remember there’s something out there that’s neither man nor beast. And if you’re lucky, maybe you’ll get a warning. But most aren’t.



Stay safe.
