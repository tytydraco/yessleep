Something weirds going on….

Now coming from (redacted) carry’s a reputation with it, well for obvious reasons. And while this town was founded by a group of religious zealots who took their own lives following some phony prophet, this does not reflect the rest of the people who still live here, we’re good people. And that happened over 20 years ago, and since ya know they are all dead, me and the local police have rejected the “theory” that this cult is responsible for…well.

 The missing person posters.

For the past few weeks I've noticed more and more missing persons flyers, and for the most part I held sympathy but I didn't think too much of it. Sadly people go missing around here all the time, drugs mainly nowadays. People can go on benders and not be found for weeks.

But something the other day really made me pay more attention to posters. I was walking down the road with my hands full of groceries from the store and I glanced at a freshly posted flyer. The sight of it made me drop everything I was carrying. This couldn't be right. Someone had to be playing some sick joke on me.This new missing persons flyer posted, showed my own face and information.  

Gathering what I could off the ground and wiping off the wilk and eggs that covered my stuff I realized that there was a number on the sign. Taking the whole sign down i brought it all home and I gave the number a call. And I got nothing. It was an answering machine, for a man who said his name was Charles, left him a message asking what the deal was and I got on with my day.

After cleaning up and putting my stuff away in the kitchen I went to wash off all the eggs and milk from my arms, hoping in the shower I would start to talk to myself about my thoughts. Speaking out loud sort of just helps me organize my thoughts better I guess.

While deep in conversation with myself I thought I heard a noise outside the bathroom. Poking my head out of the shower to try to listen better the sound seemed to disappear. If i could describe it i would say the sound of someone just being there. Like the floor flexing and breaths being taken, a nearly unnoticeable change in the silence of my house. But since the sound stopped i guessed it was just maybe the pipes of my shower or maybe an animal on the roof, i didn't know but i wasn't gonna let it bother me, as it was clearly nothing.

Finishing my shower in peace I got out only for that peace to be instantly shattered. As I dried my head and face I saw in the mirror, was a word or a symbol maybe? It's really hard to tell. I took a picture and I'll share it here to see if anyone else can see what it is supposed to be, but either way. I did not write that, and worse yet when I poked my head out of the shower a minute or two before it wasn't there, it was just steam on the mirror.

With that i packed a bag and started to drive to my moms house only stopping at the police station to file a report and get maybe get some help from the police, they took it pretty seriously thankfully and later that night while i was at my moms house i got a phone call from an officer at my house. He said they searched up and down not seeing anything, but he still advised me to stay at my moms house for the night. Which I planned to anyway.

In the middle of the night i woke up to what i thought was a car flashing its headlights as it drove by but i wasn't too sure, and it took me some time to fall back to sleep as the coat rack that haunted me throughout my childhood in this home drew my attention just like it did 20 years ago. My kid mind back then always imagined it was a man standing watching me sleep for hours, but I'm an adult now so I tried my best to brush it off. But for a few hours I lay and stared at the coat rack making sure it was just that, until I passed out. 

The next day my mom was really reluctant to even talk to me about anything, and when I brought up the weirdness of it all she just told me I was gonna be late for work, and well she was right. Racing to work i showed up 10 minutes late and as usual my boss wasn't to happy but it wasn't for me being late this time, it was because apparently someone had called and told him that i wouldn't be there and allegedly the voice on the phone sounded like me and i told my boss basically to go fuck himself and that i quite. Which I DEFINITELY did not do. While trying to explain to my boss he threatened to call the cops on me if I didn't leave, so I left and went back home to grab some more stuff before going back to my moms. 

Once I got there I found something that grew a chill on my neck and spine. As I packed a bigger bag I opened my large closet to grab something when I saw some fiberglass insulation scattered around the closet. Confused, I looked up to the entrance of the crawl space when I saw it was open, and not slightly open. it was very open, Open enough for a person to crawl through. As I stood shocked in horror I went to take a photo but a thud from downstairs sent me into flight mode. I silently ran into my room, grabbed my bag and laptop, and tried my best to be quiet as I opened my window. Right as I heard the closet door outside, close violently I jumped. The 2 story fall hurt like hell and made me limp to my car but it was better than meeting whoever was in my house. 

While driving I called the police and told them someone was there. Later though that same deputy called me sounding sort of confused. He said my house was fine, no one was there and it don't even look like someone had been there in a while, meaning whoever it was, cleaned my house after I left. But it was impossible. I called minutes after I left. Getting to my moms house I tried to convince her of what was going on, grabbing my camera out of my bag to show her the writing on the mirror, when I realized my camera was broken. It probably broke when I jumped out of the window, but luckily the SD card was still intact. After a long loading time from the damaged chip my mom left the room to keep doing what she was doing, eventually the photo gallery finally loaded. And i got a message telling me that the SD was nearly full, this really confused me as i just bought it. 

Looking at the pictures made my blood run cold. Aside from a dozen or so photos I had taken in the week or so I had the card, the majority of the 500gb SD card was filled with photos of me sleeping. Not even just at my house, some of the newer photos were of me last night at my moms house. Over 200 pictures were of me laying staring toward the camera in the corner of my room. I put it together that where the coat rack stood is where the camera was. Taking pictures of me for hours. After i fell asleep whoever took the pictures turned the flash back on, the pictures lasted until morning when i woke up.

Calling out for my mom in horror, I got up to look around when I found she wasn't even there. Her car was gone, where the hell did she go at a time like this? Behind me I heard something, it was faint but distinct enough for me to hear, the sound of someone letting out a bigger than intended breath too quickly to stifle it . Not looking back I ran out of the house and down the road. In a panic I got on the first bus I saw, which luckily for me was headed out of town. It was a long bus ride, so I had time to collect my thoughts and write this up. I'm heading to my dads in (redacted) . I'll post more of the photo’s once I'm there.
