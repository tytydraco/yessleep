My grandmother Grace was an odd woman. Growing up, she always had strange superstitions, goofy ways of speaking, peculiar habits—that felt less like quirks, and more like rehearsals.

Like things she had once seen done…and could not forget.

She would tap her knee three times before answering the phone.

And sometimes she would mutter, under her breath, “Don’t let it count.”

Never left a door open behind her, even for a second.

She told me once, half-asleep, that if you leave a door open behind you, something else might slip through. “Things don’t *like* to be behind you,” she whispered. “They prefer to walk beside.”

But there was one story she would repeat to me, over and over.

It was the story of her twin sister, *Mary.*

She said it happened when they were young, around ten years old.

Their family had just moved into an old, creaky farmhouse on the edge of Dutch Country, far out in Pennsylvania.

It was the kind of place no one paid much attention to, a house that always seemed to be cloaked in shadow, even when the sun was shining.

The realtor said it had good bones.

A strong and sturdy home built with wood and stone.

But Grace said it had bad memories. The kind of house that did not like being watched during the day—and watched back at night.

Inside, the walls were barren and peeling, the floors groaned with every step. The wood always felt cold, even in summer. Grace swore she once heard knocking from under it—not loud. Just…patient.

Grace said she always avoided that fifth step. Not because it creaked—but because it didn’t.

*“It always listened,”* she once told me, “Like it was waiting to be invited.” Grace believed the fifth step was not part of the house at all. “It’s a promise,” she said once, eyes glassy. “One, two, three, four—you are safe. But five is the first gift you give away.”

All her family wanted was to escape the city desperately, so despite its advanced age, this house was a welcome sight, at least to their parents.

Neither Mary nor my grandmother Grace liked the house.

From the moment they moved in, she said it gave her a bad feeling. But she didn’t have much choice, and the rest of the family seemed happy enough. So, she kept quiet, trying to settle into their new life with her sister.

It did not take long before strange things started happening.

One night, as Mary lay awake in their shared room, she heard something. My grandmother, who was in bed beside her, didn’t notice, but Mary swore she heard a voice.

*“Mary, I’m on the first step.”*

Mary said the voice was almost gentle.

*Too gentle.*

Like someone trying to imitate how a mother might call you to dinner—but without understanding why. She said it spoke like it had a mouth *full of someone else’s teeth.*

At first, she thought it was just the old house playing tricks on her—a draft, or maybe her imagination. She mentioned it to Grace the next morning, but my grandmother had not heard a thing.

Their parents laughed it off too, saying old houses creak, and that it was probably just the wind.

But no matter how much she plead, the next night, the voice came once more.

*“Mary, I’m on the second step.”*

This time, it was louder—closer. Mary was sure of it. She lay perfectly still, her heart pounding in her chest, staring at the door to the hallway. It was just her and Grace in the room, but only Mary seemed to hear it. She asked Grace again the next morning, but Grace still had no memory of any voice.

As the nights passed, the voice kept coming, one step at a time. Every night it climbed higher.

*“Mary, I’m on the third step.”*

*“Mary, I’m on the fourth step.”*

By now, Mary was terrified. She would lie awake each night, too scared to move, too scared to breathe. Each night the voice crept closer, and each night Mary became more convinced something was coming for her.

*“Mary, I’m on the fifth step.”*

She could picture it—something unseen, inching its way up the old wooden stairs, getting closer and closer to her room.

My grandmother tried to comfort her, but she was powerless to help her twin sister. She had never heard the voice herself, and their parents continued to dismiss it as a child's imagination.

*“Mary…”* The voice echoed out of character. *“Mary…I’m in the hallway.”*

The voice was no longer on the stairs. It was right outside the door now. Just inches away. The door felt so thin, so fragile, like it could shatter at any moment. Mary barely slept at all anymore. She kept the light on, but it didn’t help.

Mary asked my grandmother Grace again and again—why she couldn’t hear it.

Grace just frowned and said: “I think I *don’t want to.*”

*Then the last night came.*

*“Mary…”* The voice echoed again as Mary clung to her now awake sister Grace for comfort. *“Mary…I’m in your room.”*

The whisper was right beside her. She said it felt cold—so cold she could almost see her breath. She told my grandmother she could feel it, something unseen, brushing against her cheek.

Grace, still sharing the room with her, never heard a thing and went back asleep. She assumed it would be the same as it had every night, she always found Mary frozen in fear each morning, wide-eyed, her face pale as if she had been in the presence of something terrible.

But the next morning was different.

My grandmother woke up to an empty bed beside her. Mary’s side of the room was untouched, except for a tear in the bedsheet.

*No one ever saw her leave.*

They searched the house, called for her, but it was as if she had disappeared into thin air. The only trace of her was that small rip in the fabric, as if something had dragged her away.

The tear was jagged, but curved. Not like something pulled—but like something slipped through. Like fabric had tried to hold onto what was leaving…and failed.

Grace once said it looked as if a seam had opened—and the world had let go of Mary, like cloth fraying at the edge of something older underneath.

After that, Grace never sewed again.

My grandmother never spoke about what happened that morning—not in full.

But once, years later, when I asked her why it was *her* who stayed…she looked at me, her eyes far away, and said quietly:

*“We were twins. But sometimes, you only need one.”*

It was an odd thing to say—odd enough that it lingered.

Mary’s disappearance left their parents devastated. At first, they searched the house, calling out Mary’s name as if she might be hiding in some forgotten corner.

When that turned up nothing, the search expanded.

Neighbors and local authorities combed the nearby woods, trudging through thick underbrush and muddy paths, calling for her. Search parties scoured the surrounding hills for days, their voices echoing in the fading daylight, but no trace of Mary was ever found.

Not a footprint, not a scrap of clothing—nothing.

As time passed, whispers began to spread. The authorities suggested Mary had run away, but her parents refused to believe it. She was not the kind of child to disappear on her own. Still, with no evidence of foul play, they had little choice but to accept the hollow explanations offered to them.

The farmhouse grew colder, heavier, as if Mary’s absence had sucked all the warmth out of the air. John, their father, took it the hardest. He stopped speaking much, his once hearty laugh replaced by long, drawn-out silences. Most nights, Grace would find him sitting at the bottom of the stairs, staring up into the shadows.

Sometimes, she would even hear him mutter Mary’s name, as if expecting her to answer from the top step.

Weeks turned into months, but John never gave up. He walked the woods by himself late into the night, searching for any sign of his daughter, his lantern casting long, wavering shadows among the trees.

He scoured every inch of the land around the farmhouse, and every time he returned empty-handed, a little more of him seemed to disappear, too.

He grew thinner, his face gaunt, his eyes hollow, as if something had drained him of life.

Then the neighbors began to talk.

Some said the farmhouse was jinxed.

One old neighbor swore they had heard the same voice when they were young. Not the name “Mary,” but their own.

Just once.

*From the woods.*

“I turned and looked,” they said. “That is the difference between me and her. It doesn’t like to be refused twice.”

Others believed that Mary’s disappearance was not the first time strange things had happened there; that vengeful Native Americans had cursed the land against their colonizers.

Others speculated that John knew more than he let on, that his guilt was more than just a father’s regret.

Some few even believed that Mary was simply insane, and took her own life in a sequestered corner of the property, now haunting the house from beyond the grave.

One of my grandmother Grace’s old friends—Mrs. Ellery, I believe—told me once, long after everything had happened, that Grace had always had a peculiar imagination. Said she used to spin stories at school that “weren’t like the others.”

“She told my Ruthie once,” Mrs. Ellery murmured over her tea, “That names are like coats. That is how the Fair Ones find you.” She chuckled softly, almost out of habit. “Grace had told her not to go giving your full name out so freely. It’s too easy to wear. You want something twisted, something with thorns in the syllables. Something no one else can put on right.’”

She stirred her tea a moment longer before adding, “Grace said if you ever *take* your name off—truly take it off—something else might wear it. But only if you love the person enough to give it away.”

I asked her what that was supposed to mean. Mrs. Ellery just shook her head. “Children’s talk. Make-believe. I doubt Grace even remembered saying it.”

But then she gave me a strange look—half warning, half regret. Like there was more she almost said, and nearly wished she had not.

Still, at the time, none of the rumors seemed to matter.

Because Mary was gone, and that was the only truth the family could hold onto.

Eventually, the weight of the house became unbearable. The air inside felt suffocating, thick with silence and unshed tears. They packed up what little they had and moved away, hoping that distance would help them escape the memories. But it did not. Grief followed them, clinging to them like a shadow they could not shake.

John, especially, never found peace. He grew more withdrawn, spending hours alone in the small, cluttered room that had become his refuge.

Grace would sometimes find him sitting in the dark, staring at nothing, his lips moving silently.  Once, he turned to her suddenly and said, “You were awake.”

Grace did not answer. She just left the room.

She never asked what he was thinking, but she knew.

It was always about Mary.

*His favorite daughter.*

On a particularly bad night, Grace found him once laying *on* the fifth step, whispering. “Take me instead,” he shouted. “I’ll listen this time.”

He died two years later, though not from any illness. At least, not a *physical one*. The doctor said it was a heart attack, but Grace knew better.

It was guilt that killed him—the weight of all the nights he did not listen, the times he laughed off Mary’s fears. The sound of those steps still haunted him, just as they haunted her.

Every night, as he lay awake in bed, he heard them.

Step by step.

Always coming closer.

After John’s death, the silence became unbearable for Eleanor, their mother. She drifted through the days like a ghost, her movements mechanical, her eyes empty. Grace, now old enough to understand the loss, began to carry the burden of her family’s grief on her own shoulders.

She never stopped thinking about Mary.

Never stopped wondering what had really happened.

For years, she was haunted by the memory of Mary’s final words—*Mary…Mary…I’m in your room*.

She often wondered what had really happened that night. Had Mary been imagining things?

Was it all in her head, a mental break from the stress of moving to a new place?

Or was it something more? Something darker? Even so, where did she go?

I have spent a lot of time thinking about this story since my grandmother first told it to me.

I used to wonder if Mary had just run away, vanishing into the night in a way none of us could understand. Maybe it was easier to believe that—a scared little girl escaping a life she did not want. But there was no evidence, no footprints, no sightings, nothing. Just silence.

Then again, maybe it was not something so simple. Perhaps there really was a sinister figure, lurking in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to take her. My great-grandfather never stopped searching those woods, convinced something was out there. His guilt consumed him until the day he died, muttering to himself about the steps he swore he could hear in the dead of night.

And yet, as I grew older, I began to wonder if it was something far worse—something none of us could ever begin to explain.

My grandmother never believed Mary had imagined the voice.

No, she always thought there was something more, something beyond this world that set its sights on her sister.

Something patient, waiting in the darkness, climbing those steps, night after night, until it finally reached her. My grandmother’s voice would always drop to a whisper when she recounted that part, as if speaking too loudly might awaken whatever had been creeping through their house all those years ago.

There was one thing I knew was for certain, something terrible happened at that old farmhouse in Dutch Country.

Yet, I never knew what to make of the story. It seemed like just another strange tale from my grandmother’s past—a ghost story to scare curious children, nothing more.

*Grace died one year ago.*

At the healthy age of one hundred and four.

I remember the way the house felt after. Not sad. Not empty. Just still. As if something had finally stopped watching.

The day before her funeral, I found a box she had left for me, tucked away in the back of her old armoire. My name was written on the lid in her familiar, looping script.

Inside, there was no note. Just three things.

A bundle of black thread, knotted in loops of five.

A small charm made of bent, rusted wire—shaped like a crooked staircase.

And a single sheet of torn paper, folded over twice. In faint, uneven pencil marks, someone had written:

*“Don’t answer if it is not your name.”* It said on the first line.

*“Your name is already close enough.”*

The handwriting was childish. Scrawled. The kind of thing you would find on the back of a school worksheet.

But it was not Grace’s.

At least…I do not think it was.

I told myself it was just one of her old trinkets. Grace was always superstitious. Always writing down little rules she claimed “weren’t hers.” I laughed it off. Tossed the wire charm back in the box. I even showed it to a friend once and called it “vintage creepy chic.”

I have seen people write off strange objects in horror stories as symbolic.

Keepsakes.

But Grace’s box didn’t feel symbolic. It felt like an agreement. Like a contract half-signed.

And for a while, it was nothing more than that.

*Until now.*

I live in a modern apartment. Concrete floors. Steel supports. No wood anywhere in the building. Below me is a parking garage.

No one walks under my room.

I should not hear anything from beneath me.

And yet…I did.

It started as a sound I did not recognize.

Soft. Deliberate.

Like pressure rolling against something that shouldn’t be there.

Then came the creaking.

Not like weight—but like memory. Like something old, trying to remember how to walk again.

Because last night, as I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, I heard something.

It was faint at first. Barely audible. But unmistakable.

Something feminine…and yet childish.

*A whisper.*

Curling up from the dark beneath the floorboards that do not exist.

“*Martin,*” it said,

“*I’m on the first step.*”
