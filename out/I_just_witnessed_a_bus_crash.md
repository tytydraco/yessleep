This all started when I left my class around 7pm. I was exhausted as usual wondering why I decided to schedu-

Boom.

The sound of the bus colliding with and subsequently crumpling the man was sharp. I saw the terrified look on the man’s face a the second before impact. I saw the shadowy substance ooze over his shoulders. For a brief second, I saw a face. It disappeared with the violent crash that ensued but I knew I never wanted to see that face again. 

“He looked so scared.” The girl filmed the wreck on her iPhone with an emotionless stare into her screen. “What do you mean?” I said. She stopped recording and rewinded the video to 15 second before the wreck. The video showed the big hill across the road from the school. The wind blowing the trees at the top of it. “Why were you filming this?” I asked. “I had a weird feeling. Keep watching.”

That’s when I saw it. A person emerged from the trees at the top of the hill. They were running from something but it was difficult to see anything behind him in the tall grass. All of the sudden a second head appeared over the running man’s shoulder. The face was horrifying. It appeared to have no features but could produce a mouth with jagged teeth to speak and gorey pits in eye sockets to see. The mouth opened and began to speak to the man. Within seconds the man was screeching begging the face to stop. The figure followed closely with jagged movements but never made contact with the man. As they approached the road, the figure stopped and stared at something ahead. The bus crushed the man and swerved into oncoming traffic totaling a minivan and igniting flames across the strip of road ahead. 

The girl looked pale after watching the video back. “I see it.” There it was standing behind the minivan engulfed in flames. The face looked different. It looked familiar but it made me sad. It was too far in the distance to make out facial features and before I could get a closer look the girl grabbed me by my shoulder and whipped me around. “Don’t look at it. All you can do now is try to ignore it. The more you let it in, the more it will know.” she said with a monotone voice. “How do you know all this?” I asked. “I have a weird feeling.” she replied.

I began to panic. Who was this girl? Why aren’t we calling the police? Was this a dream? I turned to the flaming minivan but I did not see the figure. When I turned back the girl was gone too. Sirens filled the air and a police officer came to take a statement from me. At around 8 I was free to leave and I started walking to the bus station down the street. 

The walk was uncharacteristically cold for May in Illinois and my vision seemed to be getting increasingly worse after staring at the flames. I thought I was hallucinating when I saw the dark figure sitting at the bus stop in the distance. As the face turned towards me I started to run in the other direction but the road behind me was pitch black. I turned back towards the bus stop and saw headlights in the distance and no trace of the figure. I shook my head and walked towards the stop. 

The bus was empty. The driver had his hat pulled low and didn’t say anything but pointed to the stops. I told him mine and we took off. As I rested my head against the uncomfortable brown seat, I noticed something following the bus in the distance. I told the bus driver about the follower and he slammed on the breaks. The bus door opened and his withered hand extended pointing towards my exit. I started to argue but was quickly interrupted by a low growl that shook the bus and I lunged towards the open door and sprinted into the woods. 

I ran for 20 minutes before I saw the face in a tree above me. The face was mangled but I could see who it used to be. It was the face of the girl filming the accident. It was the face of my sister. My sister passed away in a car wreck 2 months ago while my best friend was driving. She didn’t want to go because he had been drinking but I insisted. It’s been hard to live with. 

“I told you I had a weird feeling. Why didn’t you listen to me?” a low whisper emerged from my sisters face. The adrenaline pushed my body into overdrive as I continued to sprint through the woods climbing a hill using only light from the moon. Suddenly the figure was running next to me. I could feel it’s stare and I could hear it tearing through branches in its path. “I had a weird feeling. What else did I need to say? You knew I was uncomfortable.” the voice whispered almost directly in my ear. “I’m so sorry!” I screamed.

The figure disappeared and I saw a break in the trees at the top of the hill. It looked light outside again. When I got to the top, I looked out to see a road at the bottom of the hill and a building with a few people outside. I turned down the hill to see the figure on many legs crawling up the hill towards me. I felt my heart drop and started ascending the hill as fast as I could knowing full well that it wasn’t fast enough. 

I am sprinting down the hill now and I can feel the figure crawling close behind with jagged movements seen from the corner of my eye. I think I should try to get to those people. Maybe they can help.
