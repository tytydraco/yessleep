Part I: The Man on the Moon

My grandfather swore this happened in rural Arkansas, back when the nights were darker and the woods felt closer.

One clear evening, he took his wife and their two boys outside to look at the moon. He said it was bright enough to light the fields, that familiar face staring down the way it always had round, pale, smiling in that way people like to pretend is friendly.

They stood there a while, just looking

Then the smile changed.

My grandfather said it wasn’t fast. That’s what bothered him most. The mouth stretched too wide, the eyes sunk in, and the face on the moon twisted into something cruel. Something that knew they were watching. The thing laughed no sound, just the shape of laughter burned into the sky.

His wife screamed. The boys froze.

My grandfather didn’t think. He ran back inside, grabbed his rifle, and came out onto the porch. He lined up the sights and fired straight at the moon.

The shot echoed across the fields.

And the face fell.

They said the light went black for a second like the sky blinked. Then something tore loose and came down hard in the field behind the house. The ground shook. The air smelled scorched, like lightning had struck dirt.

By morning, there was a blackened scar in the field. Burn marks that didn’t match any fire, any storm, or any farming accident. The grass never grew right there again.

For a long time, that was all anyone talked about.

Years later, my father and my uncle those two boys swore they saw something else. They said the face didn’t stay in the ground. That one night, long after the impact, they watched it rise from the scorched earth and slip into the woods behind the house.

They said it moved like it was unfinished.

Like it was hiding.

When I was a kid, they told us this story around the fire. Right before they did, they’d burn a small patch of the field, controlled, safe, just enough to leave dark marks in the dirt. Then they’d point and say, “That’s where it landed.”

And behind my childhood home, the woods still stood thick and quiet.

They never said it went back to the sky.

They said it’s still out there watching, waiting for someone to look up too long.

Part II: The Devil in the Woods

I went into the woods alone all the time as a kid.

They were behind our house, past the field, thick with pine and scrub oak. I’d take my BB rifle—the plastic stock light against my shoulder—and play for hours. I pretended it was a zombie outbreak, that the trees were buildings and the shadows were things I could outsmart if I stayed quiet.

The woods always felt familiar.

Until one afternoon they didn’t

The sounds thinned out first. No birds. No bugs. Even my footsteps seemed to sink instead of land. I walked farther than I meant to and came across a stand of trees I didn’t recognize.

They were dead.

Not fallen—standing. Their bark was coated in a dull grey clay, dry and cracked, smeared thick at about head height. Up close, the shapes started to come together: shallow hollows where eyes might be, ridges like brows, long dragged lines that suggested mouths pulled too far sideways.

None of them were complete.

That was what felt wrong.

I raised the BB rifle without thinking, the way you do when you’re playing a game and don’t want to admit you’re nervous. The barrel pointed between the trees, steady, familiar.

Something shifted deeper in the woods.

Not a sound, attention.

Between two trunks, a shape leaned forward. The devil wasn’t fully in the open, but I saw enough of its face to know it hadn’t been made here. The skin was pale and strained, like it didn’t belong to gravity. Its eyes fixed on the rifle, not me.

And it changed.

Not into a smile. Into anger.

The face tightened. The mouth drew back slightly, showing darkness behind it. The air pressed heavy, like the woods were holding their breath. I understood then, sudden and cold: it didn’t see a toy.

It saw the rifle.

The thing that had torn it out of the sky.

The clay on the trees around me seemed to pull, just a little, like drying mud flexing. Those half-formed faces didn’t move, but I felt them paying attention the same way the devil was—alert, aligned.

I lowered the rifle.

The pressure eased. Not gone. Just reduced, like a hand loosening on my throat.

The devil didn’t step forward.

It didn’t need to.

I ran.

I don’t remember the path back, only branches striking my arms and the sound of something moving parallel to me, never closer, never farther. When I broke out of the tree line into the yard, I didn’t look back.

That night, the moon hung low and pale.

I stayed inside.

Years later, I still think about those trees, how the clay had been pressed into them again and again, like practice. Like the woods had been taught a shape and kept trying to remember it.

And I wonder if the only reason I was allowed to leave

was because I put the rifle down

and reminded it

that I wasn’t the one who made it fall

Part III : What Watched Him

My father went into the woods looking for me.

That’s what he told himself, anyway.

The house had gone quiet in that dangerous way too sudden, like something had slipped its leash. He was drunk enough to feel brave and clear-headed at the same time, which was always when he made his worst decisions. He staggered past the field and into the trees, calling my name like it was an accusation.

He kept seeing eyes.

Low ones. Half-hidden. Pale shapes at the edge of his vision that vanished when he turned his head. He knew what they were. He knew it was us—me and my siblings watching him the way kids do when they don’t understand what’s happening but know it matters.

“Come out,” he shouted.

His voice didn’t travel far. The woods swallowed it quickly, like it didn’t want the noise.

He pushed deeper, brushing past branches, shoving through saplings, knocking shoulders into trunks. He told himself he was angry, but underneath that was something else—humiliation. The feeling of being seen when you hadn’t agreed to be.

The trees changed around him.

Some of them were dead but still standing, their bark smeared with a dull grey clay. The shapes pressed into them weren’t obvious at first. Just unevenness. Texture. But the longer he walked, the clearer they became—shallow eye hollows, dragged lines where mouths might be. Faces that didn’t quite settle into expression.

They were at about head height.

He swore and slapped one as he passed, knocking flakes of dry clay to the ground. The sound was wrong—too soft, like hitting packed dirt instead of wood. He laughed once, sharp and brittle, and kept going.

“Real funny,” he said to no one.

“You think you’re tough?”

The woods didn’t answer.

Farther in, the trees thinned just enough to open a small space. One trunk stood wider than the rest, darker, its surface smoother where hands might naturally rest. He reached it without thinking, leaned forward, and pressed his forehead against it.

It wasn’t cold.

That registered first. Not warmth exactly. density. Like leaning against something that could lean back if it chose to.

He froze.

Slowly, carefully, the surface under his skin shifted. Not moving away—becoming. The shape he’d mistaken for bark pulled inward, lines forming where none had been before. A face emerged, not forced or violent, but remembered.

The Man on the Moon looked back at him.

Not the smiling one from childhood books. The older one. The one with eyes set too deep, features stretched thin by distance and time. Pale. Familiar. Close enough now that there was no sky between them.

My father’s breath hitched. His mind reached for anger, for denial, for drink, but none of it fit. This wasn’t something you fought.

This was something that had already been watching.

The face didn’t speak. It didn’t need to. Its stillness carried recognition, like a quiet acknowledgment between two things that had been aware of each other for a long time.

I remember you.

I’ve seen this before.

Behind him, the woods felt attentive. The clay-faced trees didn’t move, but their impressions seemed deeper somehow, less exaggerated than before. More precise.

My father stumbled back, nearly falling, his hands scrambling for balance. He didn’t scream. There was nothing left in him loud enough for that. He turned and ran, crashing through the trees toward the house, toward light, toward the life he understood how to control.

He never spoke about that night.

But after it, things changed.

He learned to keep his voice low. Learned how to hurt without leaving marks. Learned how to wait until no one else was looking.

Whatever had been watching him didn’t follow him home.

It didn’t have to.

It had already learned what it needed

Part IV : The Story He Told Instead

My grandfather never believed the story the way we did.

He was a practical man. If something didn’t make sense, you shaped it until it did. He didn’t like loose ends, especially when they frightened children. Fear was easier to manage when it belonged to him.

That night, he took his boys outside because the moon was bright and they kept talking about it. The fields were quiet, the air clear enough that everything felt closer than usual. Someone said the moon looked strange. Someone else said it looked like it was watching.

He looked up longer than he meant to.

Not in awe. Not in fear. Just measuring it, the way a man measures weather or distance or the weight of a problem that might need solving. He squinted and said, almost to himself, “That ain’t right.”

He went inside and came back with his rifle.

Later, he’d say he was just messing with them. That he fired into the sky to make a sound, to give the boys a story they’d remember. He laughed when he told it, like that explained everything. Kids scare easy. Stories grow. That was all.

The shot wasn’t meant to hit anything.

It didn’t need to.

It marked direction.

It marked authority.

Something above the field learned, for the first time, that there was a place it could be forced out of.

My grandfather never claimed anything fell. When people talked about burn marks or scars in the land, he waved it off. Said fields change. Said woods creep. Said memory does worse than both. He preferred a version of the story that stayed manageable.

So that’s the one he told.

About a devil in the moon.

About a joke taken too far.

About children filling in the gaps.

What he didn’t talk about was how part of the field never settled right afterward. How the woods behind it felt closer in the years that followed, as if something had learned where to rest. Those details didn’t fit, so he left them out.

He died believing he’d only made a story.

But fear doesn’t care why it’s taught.

Whatever had been displaced that night did not fear pain. It learned something far more useful: how to avoid falling again. How to press itself into places that would hold. How to remain once it had been named, repeated, and explained away.

And the first thing the devil ever learned from us

was not how to hurt

but how to stay where it was put.
