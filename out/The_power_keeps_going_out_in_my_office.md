I want to start by saying I hadn’t worked in over three months. So, when this place called me back, I was more than eager to dive right in. I would have taken any job, but this one seemed easy enough. I’ve had a lot of jobs over the years—something about 'adult ADHD,' or whatever the doctor called it—this one isn't so bad but recently some pretty weird things have been happening.

The Job itself is easy: facilities maintenance for an office supply company. I actually don’t even really know what they do here. If I’m being honest, I’m not even sure the workers know either. They *say* they sell printers and paper and things, but I don’t actually ever see that happening. They *say* they love their job! But weirdly enough, no one ever really talks to each other, so the place is often quiet and typically smells like stale coffee and whatever old air-freshener they overuse in the lobby.

It’s a boring job. Well, the *office* is boring, my job is actually kind of interesting. This place was built in the 60’s or 70’s I think and so most of the systems are out-of-date and something always seems to be breaking. My boss, Earl, says he knows everything there is to know about this place and that most of it runs off hopes and a good prayer which is good because I know nothing about maintenance.

Earl is… interesting. A 70’s something grizzled old veteran with no sense of humor; at least not one I get. He’s got a massive beer gut, smells faintly of liquor and always has a half-smoked cigarette hanging from his lips no matter how much the HR lady seems to bark at him for it.

Normally, things around here aren’t too hard to fix. Leaky faucets, buzzing lights, that one toilet that always clogs, things like that. But, for the past few weeks, for reasons we don’t know, the power has been going out. At first, it would just blink, a few flickers and then we were back in business, but recently it’s been getting worse. Last Friday It went out for over 15 minutes! Every time it goes out Earl tells me to just wait around and that he’ll be back. He apparently likes to tackle new projects by himself. Says it helps him “really get the lay of the land.” Whatever the hell that means. It’s starting to become an odd routine. Power goes out, “Stay here.” Earl goes into the basement. The power comes back on.

It really doesn’t bother me that Earl doesn’t want my help, in fact, I typically just go into the break room and eat a snack or slink back to the maintenance “office” which just happens to be a big closet full of random tools and other junk.  Yesterday the power went out for about 12 minutes and when Earl returned, he had a nasty cut across the back of his hand and was consequently leaving a trail of blood wherever he walked. I grabbed him a kitchen towel from the breakroom and asked him if he was ok to which he grumbled, “Ah, this is nothing.” For what it’s worth, I could have guessed he would say that. It may come as no surprise, but Earl is a man of few words, so few words in fact, that even after 6 months I still don’t know much about the guy. I know that he’s great at being grumpy in between telling me to hand him a vaguely described tool and that he did his “duty,” which I’m assuming is war related, but other than that he’s still a stranger.

I was starting to get used to the routine when something weird happened. Earlier today the lights started their now-familiar song and dance, then as if on cue, cut out entirely. Earl looked up from his newspaper, got up, and headed for the basement. I asked him if he needed any help this time but, as always, he had it under control. I was busy eyeing the useless vending machine’s bountiful selection of old potato chips and peanut butter crackers when all at once, without warning, a piercing scream ripped through the stillness, coming from the basement. I jumped out of my skin and rushed to the basement stairs only to see Earl wiping away sweat from his forehead with the same dirty rag he uses for everything. He was sporting yet another battle wound except this one was across his face and, now that I think about it, it resembled a set of scratches, really. I asked him what the hell happened, and he shrugged it off. Something about the boilers overheating? Earl brushed past me and headed for the restroom. I asked him what we should do about the power which seemed to remind him of our predicament. Before Earl had the chance to response the light came back on.

Earl actually ended up leaving early today. He said he wasn’t feeling too well and just wanted to lay down. In the time I’ve been here Earl hasn’t ever left early, hell, he’s never even taken a day off. But I figured Earl *is* pretty old and this whole power issue has seemed to be kicking his ass. The last few hours of the day went fine. I was in the middle of making a paperclip chain when I stopped to think. Why *did* earl have those scratches on his face? Why did they look like scratches and what the hell was that awful scream. I didn’t even know the building had a boiler system? What even is a boiler system? I had too many questions, so I decided to just go check it out myself. Surprisingly, Earl had locked the basement and none of the keys I had seemed to fit the lock. I went to ask the HR lady, Brenda, if she happened to have an extra key, but she seemed too scatter-brained to understand what I was asking and so I left and went back to the closet.

I’ve decided to keep a record of everything weird that’s been happening. I’m writing this from a dusty-old desktop that has been in the corner of this closet since who knows when. I was surprised it even turned on. Tomorrow I’m going to ask Earl if we can *both* take a look at the electrical system. I’m dying to figure out what’s going on.. and maybe understand why Earl has been acting so weird. I’ll update this record as soon as I know more. Bye for now.
