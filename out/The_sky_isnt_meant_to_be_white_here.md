I’m shaking as I write this. I don’t feel safe in my home anymore too.

For context, I(46m) live alone on Svalbard (this Norwegian archipelago), close to Pyramiden. My grandfather used to live there and I inherited his place 22 years ago- I originally lived in mainland Europe when I decided whatever and moved to my grandad’s place because there just wasn’t anything worth living there anymore for. Sadly my parents had passed previously and I was never that much of a looker- so no girlfriend either. Of course I had mates but let’s be honest, they weren’t very bright and personally, I didn’t think they were worth missing up a whole new experience for.

It’s usually very dark all year round- and cold too. Svalbard is way up North so it’s typically going to be freezing. Plus I usually just stay indoors until the late evening when I’ll go out and walk along this old path around the perimeter of the old mining town as it used to have sidewalks or paths. The evening walk itself is usually beautiful. The northern lights light up the navy ink that stretches across the sky. The temperature and how dark it usually is drives away neighbours and tourists from my area specifically, while there are a couple old abandoned homes from when there were more miners. There did used to be an old woman a mile or two south but she sadly passed away last summer from heart complications. Though she was a bit of a grumpy woman. Well bless her anyway.

On my usual evening walk tonight, i heard a loud scraping and creaking noise. I assumed it’s just a faraway tree or ice cracking but the sound just got .. louder. The shadows everywhere seemed to grow darker, a bigger absence of light, with the screeching creaks and horrible groans. Much like an old tree about to snap and break in a storm.

The sound began to surround me- I could hear it from everywhere… it began to focus onto above me. The sky. The sky was creaking and screeching. I was terrified out of my wits. Still am.

Suddenly the dark expanse of black cracks like thin ice on a lake. Light pours from it. It’s blinding and all the while- it keeps SCREAMING. Louder and LOUDER it goes. I feel my eardrums rupture and all I can hear is muffled, high pitched sounds- as if I stuck my head into an ice bath while there was music playing.

I gasp out in pain and touch the sides of my head- now bleeding. I’m a haemophiliac so I’m used to it.. but not from my ears. I begin to leg it as fast as my out-of-shape body will allow towards the comfort of my old cabin but the light … it’s just getting brighter.

It’s been 3 hours. I can’t hear anything. The sky is white. Everything else is shadow. It’s not meant to be like this- how much longer until the sky shatters completely?
