Roughly 9 years ago I worked midnights at a distribution center in my town. Small place. The kind where everyone knows each other’s grandparents and who they dated in high school. And since I was little, people always talked about County Road 1. The old highway that used to be the way to the next town before the interstate went in. Now it was just a long stretch of cracked asphalt cutting through woods and low hills, barely used except by hunters and the occasional farmer.

Stories followed that road. Missing hikers. Cars found empty. Lights in the trees. A woman screaming that no one could ever find. I used to think people in small towns just needed something to scare themselves with. Something to make the dark feel close.

That changed November 4th, 2016.

It had rained for days straight. Not normal rain either. Heavy sheets. Roads washed out. People stranded. Town felt like it was shrinking in on itself. That night, around 3 in the morning, we got off early. Everyone tired. Everyone wanting to go home and sleep to the sound of the storm.

I got in my car and my GPS immediately rerouted me. Said my usual way was flooded out. I didn’t think much about it until I saw where it was sending me.

County Road 1.

The second my tires touched that asphalt, it stopped raining. Not died down just stopped. The wipers dragged across a bone-dry windshield. The sudden silence was sharp enough that I turned up the radio just to hear anything at all.

The road looked wrong. Too dark. The trees too close on both sides. Leaning inward like they were trying to see who had come.

Two minutes in, there was a stop sign. Just there on the side of the road but there was no intersection. Nothing but trees and ditch and shadow. I laughed under my breath, but something cold slid down my back.

I kept driving.

Another sign a minute later.

“TURN AROUND.”

Same shape. Same reflective glare. Just those words.

I told myself it was a prank. Someone messing around. Someone had to have put those signs there.

A couple more minutes of driving my headlights picked up something ahead. A red pickup pulled onto the shoulder. Driver door hanging wide open. Hazards blinking slow and tired. Engine running.

I pulled in behind it.

The air outside felt heavy when I stepped out. Like I was stepping inside a photograph instead of real night. I heard rain somewhere but none fell here. No wind. No insects. No sound except distant rushing water that didn’t seem to come from anywhere.

I approached the truck. The cab light was on. The floor was muddy. The driver’s seat was drenched, like someone soaking wet had just been sitting there. A photo was wedged by the speedometer. I leaned closer to see it, but before I could see who or what it was of the radio clicked.

“Look behind you.”

The voice sounded like rocks grinding against wet wood.

I froze. Every hair on my arms stood up. My heartbeat felt slow and loud.

I didn’t want to turn. I tried not to. But my body turned anyway.

She was standing between me and my car.

My ex.

Jess.

She had died in a car accident years before. Now she stood there slouched, hair matted with mud, dress stuck to her skin like it had grown there. Her skin looked water-swollen. Her eyes were white. Half of her jaw hung off of her head, blood dripping onto the asphalt.

“Jess?” I whispered.

Her legs twisted around first. Then her torso. Then her head. Like something was pulling her in pieces. Her voice came wet and slow.

“Why… why did you let me leave…”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

Her head shook and she screeched a horrible ear piercing screech before she lunged at me. I took a step back and threw my forearm up, catching her arms on it. I swung a wild haymaker, connecting with her loose jaw, knocking her back. I scrambled for my car and dove inside, slamming the door. I threw my car in drive before her face slammed into my window, blood and mud splashing on it.

“You let us leave. You left us.”

Then she said one more thing that’s stuck with me ever since.

“They didn’t die. They’re all here.”

I gritted my teeth and threw my car in reverse, flooring it back. She stood in the middle of the road. I made eye contact before I slammed into drive and floored it, veering towards her. The front of my car jumped up and I heard bones crunch and something drag under my car before the rear end lunged up and I saw her rolling behind me in my rear view.

I floored it. I looked down and saw 110 on the speedometer before I took a breath and relaxed. But my moment of silence was interrupted by my GPS.

“102 miles until destination.”

I tried to ignore it.

Then I saw headlights ahead.

Left side of the road.

I dimmed my lights and slammed on my brakes but they did too. I finally started rolling closer, and they did the same. I squinted and leaned closer, and saw something I’ll never forget.

My car.

Same make. Same model. Same scratches. Same dent in the bumper. Same skeleton keychain dangling from the rearview. Same crack in the windshield from the deer last winter.

I let my car crawl closer until it was right next to me. I looked over and… It was me.

Same expression. Same shaking hands. Same eyes wide with fear. Same skeleton ornament hanging from the rearview mirror.

I made eye contact with myself.

My reflection blinked.

Then it smiled.

A huge smile. Its face was seemingly splitting.

The radio turned on without me touching it.

“You’re not leaving,” my own voice said. “No one leaves. Not them. Not you.”

My reflection leaned forward, jaw splitting, skin peeling like wet paper. Something pale and smooth pushed forward, breaking the window.

I slammed the gas.

The tires screamed. The reflection didn’t move. It just watched as I shot forward.

The road ahead got smaller, the trees bent down towards the ground. I looked back and the car was gone. But I saw something in my peripheral of my right eye. I looked out into the woods and saw a blurry figure running next to my car. I looked down at the speedometer. “85”. I slammed the pedal to the floor, but it still ran right next to me.

The GPS flickered, and I stared at the screen.

182 miles to go.

243 miles to go.

HOME.

I looked back out to my right and the figure was gone.

SLAM.

Something slammed into the roof of my car, and a dark bony, muddy arm smashed my window, grabbing the wheel. I flailed my fist into it, but it wouldn’t budge. It moved the wheel side to side, fishtailing my car. The radio popped on.

“You can’t leave, you can’t. No one ever leaves!”

I slammed on the brakes, and saw something incomprehensible fly off my car and onto the road:

A lanky, skeletal creature caked in river mud, its limbs too long, its skin painted in white clay patterns and handprint symbols, wearing a skirt woven from reeds, sinew, animal hide, and feathers, beads and carved river stones rattling along its wrists. Three skulls hung as masks layered over its own head, lashed together with braided wet cord, their empty sockets dripping dark water. A necklace of bones and bird talons hung across its chest, clattering as it breathed. Its ribs showed through its skin like cage bars, and its fingers were sharpened to points like carved river rock.

I floored it once again and ran it over before closing my eyes and blindly driving.

Then suddenly I heard it… rain.

I opened my eyes and I was back in my town… at an all familiar intersection.
I drove the rest of the way home in silence. I don’t think I blinked once. Once home I sat in my driveway for what seemed like forever before I got the courage to get out. I pushed the door open quickly and jumped out, running inside and locking my door. 

The next day i went out and looked at my car. No mud, no dents on the bumpers, no scratches on the roof. The only thing different is my skeleton keychain hanging off my rearview mirror was different. A crude small little figure with 3 skull heads carved from muddy wood. I threw it away, and sold my car. 

Don’t ever take County Road 1, you may not be as lucky as me.
