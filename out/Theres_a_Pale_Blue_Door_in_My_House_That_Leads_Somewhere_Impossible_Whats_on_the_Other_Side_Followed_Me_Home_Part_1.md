The moving truck pulled away, leaving behind a faint haze of exhaust in the cool autumn air. Amara stood on the porch, her arms folded against the chill, watching it go. I caught her eye and nodded to the box in my arms. “Last one,” I said, forcing a grin.

She returned a tired smile. “*Finally*. I thought this day would never end.”

Our new house sat on a quiet cul-de-sac, its peeling white paint and sagging porch giving it the charm of a fixer-upper, though neither of us had the money or the skills to fix much of anything. But it was *ours*, and more importantly, it was far away from everything we’d left behind.

I dropped the box onto the floor of the living room, a space that smelled faintly of mildew and decades of stale cigarette smoke. Sunlight streamed through grimy windows, illuminating the uneven hardwood floors and an old radiator that gurgled every few minutes, as though testing its own existence. Amara followed me in, her gaze sweeping the room.

“Well,” she said, trying to sound optimistic, “it’s...got *character*.”

“It’s perfect,” I replied. “A little scrubbing, a little paint, and this place will feel like home.”

*Home*. The word felt foreign. For months, we’d been drifting, scraping together enough cash for security deposits and ignoring the calls from our parents. My parents had made it clear they’d cut me off the moment I moved in with Amara. Her family’s response had been harsher: threatening voicemails, harassing letters, even the occasional uninvited “visit” from their church members.

Now, standing here, hundreds of miles away from their disapproval, I felt a tentative sense of peace. The house was far from ideal, but it was *ours*. A clean slate.

Amara crossed the room and stood beside me, her arm brushing mine. “It’s strange,” she said. “When I first saw the photos online, I didn’t think much of it, but now... I don’t know. Something about this place feels peculiar. And not in a charming way.”

I glanced at her. “It’s just empty. Once we get our stuff unpacked, it’ll feel better. You’ll see.”

She nodded, though the furrow in her brow didn’t relax.

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

The first few days passed in a blur of unpacking and cleaning. The house wasted little time revealing its quirks: a toilet that hissed when it flushed, a draft that seemed to come from nowhere, and faint creaks that traveled the halls at night. I wrote them off as typical old-house sounds, but Amara wasn’t convinced.

On our third night, we sat on the porch, watching the last hints of daylight fade into a bruised purple sky. The street was eerily quiet, the only movement coming from a lone cat that slunk across the yard.

“I don’t think anyone else lives on this street,” Amara said. “Have you seen a single car? A light on in any of the other houses?”

I hadn’t, but I shrugged. “It’s probably just an old neighborhood. Maybe everyone’s gone to bed early.”

“Maybe,” she said, but her voice was tight.

The following weekend, we met Walter and Elaine. They lived a few streets over and had stopped by with a plate of cookies and a practiced friendliness that only slightly masked their curiosity.

“We’ve been here thirty-five years,” Walter said, his gravelly voice carrying over the clink of coffee cups. “Seen plenty of folks come and go. But it’s been a while since anyone stuck around as long as you two have.”

I exchanged a glance with Amara. “What do you mean?”

Walter leaned back, swirling his coffee. “Well, the last owners left in a hurry. Before them, there was Roger. Lived here alone, kept to himself mostly. One day, just up and vanished. Car still in the driveway. No sign of foul play. Just... *gone*.”

“Walter,” Elaine interjected, giving him a sharp look. “Don’t scare them off. It’s a lovely house. I’m sure you’ll be happy here.”

Walter raised his hands in mock surrender. “Just telling the truth.”

Later that evening, after the neighbors left, Amara sat cross-legged on the living room floor, a troubled look on her face.

“Do you think it’s true?” she asked. “What Walter said?”

“I don’t know,” I replied honestly. “But people leave for all sorts of reasons. Maybe he just wanted to start over.”

“Like us,” she said softly.

“Exactly.” I reached for her hand. “This is our fresh start. Let’s not overthink it.”

She nodded, but I could tell Walter’s story had unsettled her. Truthfully, it had unsettled me too.

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

The rain came down in soft sheets as we pulled into the neighbors' driveway the following Friday evening. Their house was a cozy split-level with warm light spilling from its windows, a stark contrast to the chill of the gray drizzle outside. Elaine greeted us at the door with her usual cheerful demeanor, though her smile seemed more subdued than before.

“Come in, come in!” she said, ushering us inside. “Walter’s already pouring the wine.”

The dining room was modest but inviting, the air filled with the scent of roast chicken and rosemary. Walter sat at the head of the table, a glass of cabernet in hand, his gruff features softened by the flicker of candlelight.

“Good to see you two,” he said with a nod as we sat down. “We were just talking about how rare it is to have new neighbors in these parts. Doesn’t happen often.”

Elaine gave him a pointed look but said nothing as she served the chicken. Conversation meandered through small talk—Walter’s retirement from the local post office, Elaine’s baking hobby, and our plans for the property. Despite the casual tone, I noticed Walter’s gaze linger on me a beat too long whenever the the subject of the house came up.

“So,” Walter said after a while, leaning back in his chair. “How’re you settling in? New home treating you well?”

I hesitated, glancing at Amara. “It’s been fine so far. A few quirks, but nothing major.”

He chuckled, the sound low and dry, feigning amusement. “Quirks, huh? That’s *one* way to put it.”

“Walter!” Elaine warned softly, her smile fixed but strained.

“What?” he said, raising his hands innocently. “They ought to know!”

“Know *what*?” Amara asked, her tone sharper than I’d ever heard it. I shot her a look, but Walter was already speaking.

“Look, it’s an old house,” he said. “Houses like that... they’ve got stories. *Histories*. Some good, some bad. Take Roger, for instance.”

“Walter, don’t—” Elaine started, but he waved her off.

“They should know,” he repeated. Turning to us, he added, “Roger was the guy who lived there before the couple you bought the place from. Kept to himself. Quiet. But then one day, *poof*. Gone. Car in the driveway, wallet on the counter. No note, no nothing.”

A chill ran down my spine. “Right. You mentioned that the other day. What happened to him?”

Walter shrugged, taking a long sip of wine. “Your guess is as good as mine. Cops couldn’t make sense of it either. They looked for weeks but came up with nothing. Like he just... stopped existing.”

Amara’s hand slipped into mine under the table, her grip tight.

“Walter’s exaggerating,” Elaine said quickly, her voice high and tense. “Roger was... well, he wasn’t exactly the most stable person. People like that sometimes just... *leave*. It’s a big world.”

I wanted to believe her, but the unease in her voice betrayed her attempt at reassurance.

On the way home, the rain had stopped, leaving the streets slick and gleaming under the streetlights. Amara was silent, staring out the window, her arms crossed tightly.

“You okay?” I asked.

She turned to me, her expression grim. “Do you think it’s true? What Walter said?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “But it doesn’t really matter, does it? I mean, people disappear for all kinds of reasons.”

“Do they?” she countered, her voice rising. “Because that doesn’t sound like someone who just wanted a change of scenery. He left *everything* behind, Sean. Who does that?”

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

The next day, curiosity got the better of me. While Amara was at work, I drove to the local library to do a little digging. The librarian, a kind woman in her sixties, directed me to the archive section, where I spent hours sifting through old newspapers and records.

What I found only deepened the mystery.

Five years ago, Roger's disappearance had made the front page of the local paper. The article described him as a reclusive man who worked as an accountant and rarely socialized. Neighbors reported hearing strange noises coming from his house in the weeks before he vanished—low thuds, murmurs, and the occasional distant scream.

One neighbor was quoted saying, “It was like the house was alive. Sometimes I’d hear it groan, like it was settling, but not quite.”

I closed the file, a knot tightening in my stomach.

That evening, I told Amara what I’d found. She listened intently, her face pale.

“We need to leave,” she said the moment I finished.

“Amara, come on,” I said, trying to keep my voice calm. “We can’t just up and leave. We’ve sunk everything into this place.”

“And what if we’re next?” she shot back, her eyes wide with fear. “What if whatever happened to him happens to *us*?”

I didn’t have an answer. Instead, I reached for her hand. “Look, let’s not jump to conclusions. If anything weird happens—*really* weird—we’ll figure it out. *Together*. I promise.”

She didn’t look convinced, but nodded anyway. “Okay. But if it gets worse, we’re leaving. No questions.”

“Deal,” I said, though I got the feeling I was making a promise I might not be able to keep.

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

I was digging through the bedroom closet when I saw it for the first time. The light from the overhead bulb flickered weakly as I sorted through a pile of clothing, trying to find the dress shirt Amara swore was in there. I moved a hanger aside and froze.

There, at the back of the closet, was a small, pale blue door.

It was no taller than four feet, with peeling paint revealing dark, rotting wood beneath. The edges were uneven, as though it had been carved by an unsteady hand. It didn’t belong—not in a closet we’d been using for weeks. My eyes traced the lines of its warped frame, and a faint hum seemed to fill the air around me.

“Amara!” I shouted. My voice cracked, louder than I intended. “Baby, come here!”

I heard her footsteps before she appeared in the doorway. She had her hair tied back in a loose bun and a towel slung over her shoulder, mid-laundry. “What’s wrong?” she asked, then saw the look on my face. Her gaze followed mine to the back of the closet.

“What the hell is that?” she whispered, stepping closer.

“I don’t know,” I said. “It wasn’t here before.”

She crouched down, her hand brushing against the floor as she stared at it. “Sean, we’ve lived here for *weeks*. We’ve used this closet every day. How could we miss this?”

I shook my head, unable to answer. “It’s got to lead somewhere. Maybe to storage?” My voice sounded weak, even to me.

Amara stood, arms crossed tightly. “We should call someone. The realtor, maybe.”

I crouched down and reached for the small, rusted doorknob. It felt cold under my fingers. “Let’s just take a look first,” I said, though my stomach churned with unease.

“Sean—”

“Just one look,” I insisted. I turned the knob and pushed.

The door swung open silently, its hinges unnervingly smooth. Beyond it was a dimly lit room, no larger than a child’s bedroom. A single bulb hung from the ceiling, casting a sickly, yellowish glow. The walls were bare, unpainted gray concrete, and the air felt thick. The space was utterly empty.

“It’s just a storage room,” I muttered, though the words felt hollow.

Amara peered over my shoulder, her expression etched with concern. “It doesn’t make sense,” she said. “There’s no way this was here before. I *know* it wasn’t.”

Neither of us moved to step inside. The space felt *wrong*—too still, too suffocating. Finally, I pulled the door shut and stood, wiping my hands on my jeans.

“Maybe it’s some old crawlspace they never sealed off,” I said, trying to sound nonchalant. “We’ll figure it out.”

Amara didn’t answer. She just stared at the door, her jaw tight.

For the next week, we avoided the closet as much as possible. I’d open it occasionally to confirm that the door was still there, but each time, I felt my stomach clench. Amara stopped using the closet altogether, shoving her clothes into an overstuffed dresser instead.

One night, as I lay in bed, I felt her shift beside me. “I don’t like it,” she said softly. “It’s not normal, Sean.”

“It’s just a door,” I said, though I didn’t believe my own words. “We’ll seal it off if it bothers you that much.”

Her fingers found mine under the blanket, squeezing lightly. “I’m scared it’s not just a door.”

Two days later, I found out she was right.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

It was late afternoon, and Amara was at work. I’d taken a day off to catch up on repairs around the house, though I’d spent most of the morning avoiding anything remotely productive. By the time I got to the closet, I was in a mood to prove something—to the house, to myself, I wasn’t sure.

I opened the door, expecting the same empty room as before. But what greeted me was far from vacant.

The space was... *different*. The gray walls were gone, replaced by dark, wooden panels that gleamed faintly under the dim light of a single candle resting on a desk in the center of the room. Bookshelves lined the walls, crammed with old, leather-bound volumes whose spines gleamed gold and black. A staircase spiraled upward at the far end, its narrow steps disappearing into shadows.

I stepped back, slamming the door shut. It shouldn’t have been possible. I stood there for what felt like an eternity, staring at the now-closed door.

When Amara came home, I was still sitting on the edge of the bed, my hands clasped tightly in my lap.

“Sean?” she asked cautiously, dropping her bag by the door. “What’s wrong?”

I didn’t answer right away. Instead, I gestured toward the closet. “You have to see this.”

She didn’t argue. I think she already knew. Together, we walked to the closet, her hand gripping mine tightly. When I opened it, we both froze.

Both the door and the room were gone. There was no desk, no bookshelves, no staircase. Just a smooth beige wall where the pale blue door had been.

That night, the door appeared again—this time in the hallway, embedded in the wall as though it had *always* been there. Its faded blue paint and cracked edges seemed to mock us, daring us to look again.

I opened it without thinking. Amara protested, but her voice sounded muffled and distant. The room had changed yet again. This time, the door opened onto a narrow corridor that stretched far beyond what could logically fit within the house. My jaw dropped.

“Sean,” Amara whispered, her voice trembling. “Please stop.”

I closed the door, my hand shaking as I latched it shut. I couldn’t look at her, couldn’t face the fear in her eyes.

Swallowing hard, I backed away, and avoided the room for the rest of the night.

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

It appeared again three days later, this time in the living room. The pale blue door stood against the far wall, framed by flickering shadows from the late afternoon sun streaming through the curtains. The sight of it made my stomach turn, though I wasn’t sure if it was fear or something worse—*curiosity*.

“Sean, *don’t*,” Amara said, her voice sharp as I approached it. She stood by the kitchen counter, arms crossed, tapping her foot nervously. “It’s just going to get worse.”

I turned to her, hand hovering over the doorknob. “What do you think it’s going to do? Hurt us? It’s just a door.”

Her jaw tightened. “That’s not all it is, and you know it.”

She was right, of course. I *did* know. But knowing wasn’t enough to stop me. Not anymore. Slowly, I gripped the knob, half expecting it to be hot to the touch. It wasn’t. Instead, it felt unnervingly cool, like touching tools left in the shade. With a deep breath, I turned it and pushed.

This time, the door opened into a sprawling study. This room was larger than the house itself, its walls lined with bookshelves that stretched infinitely into the darkness. The scent of old paper and something faintly metallic permeated the air. In the center, there was a single wooden desk, its surface cluttered with scattered pages. Atop it, a brass holder held a single unlit candle.

“This isn’t real,” Amara whispered from behind me, her voice trembling. “It *can’t* be real.”

I didn’t reply.

My feet moved before I could stop them, crossing the threshold and stepping into the room. The wooden floor creaked beneath me, the sound echoing unnaturally, as though the space was even larger than it appeared.

The books on the shelves were aged—some with cracked leather bindings, others bound in materials I didn’t recognize. Many of their spines were engraved with titles in languages I couldn’t read, though a few were familiar. I pulled one off the shelf, the name catching my eye: *The Return of the King.*

I opened it, flipping to the end. The text was familiar at first, describing Frodo and Sam’s journey through Mount Doom. But as I read on, the more I realized something was *off*. In this version, Frodo faltered at the last moment, and the Ring slipped from his grasp—straight into Sauron’s hand. Middle-earth plunged into darkness, the world crumbling under his reign.

I slammed the book shut and turned to Amara, who had hesitated at first but eventually followed me into the room, her curiosity finally outweighing her worry. She stood beside me, thumbing through another volume. “The ending,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “It’s *wrong*.”

She looked up, her brow furrowed. “What do you mean, Sean?”

I held up the book. “It’s like it’s been rewritten. *Twisted*. Look at this.” I handed it to her, watching as her face grew paler with each word.

“This is insane,” she said, shaking her head.

She dropped the book onto the desk as if it burned her, then grabbed another from the shelf: *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.* Her fingers flipped through the pages, and I saw her face twist with discomfort as she read. “Alice doesn’t go home,” she said finally. “She gets stuck in Wonderland. *Forever*. And it’s not whimsical anymore. It’s... *cruel*.”

We kept reading, unable to stop despite the growing dread. *To Kill a Mockingbird* ended with Atticus ostracized, Scout left alone in a town that succumbed entirely to hatred. In *The Great Gatsby*, Nick never leaves Long Island, instead becoming a hollow shell of himself as he inherits Gatsby’s empty ambitions. Each story was familiar yet warped, like reflections in broken glass.

“These aren’t just wrong,” Amara said, her voice trembling. “They’re... *worse*. Like they’re designed to take hope away.”

\* \* \* \* \* \*

We left the study with a handful of books, hoping to find answers. The local bookstore owner, Mrs. Wells, listened patiently as we explained. She examined the books with skeptical eyes, running her fingers over the bindings and flipping through the pages.

“They’re interesting,” she said slowly. “But these are just stories. Maybe some kind of bootleg copies or fan rewrites. I’ve seen people do that before.”

“These aren’t rewrites,” I insisted. “They’re... wrong. And they were in our house. Through a door that shouldn’t exist.”

Susan gave me a look—the look of someone deciding whether or not they were talking to a lunatic. “Well,” she said after a pause, handing the books back to me, “I’d keep them for the novelty, at least. They’re fascinating, if nothing else.”

We left the store feeling more isolated than ever. On the drive home, Amara stared out the window, her fingers gripping her seatbelt tightly.

“What if it’s trying to show us something?” she said suddenly.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“The door. The books. What if it’s not just random? What if it’s *leading* us somewhere?”

The idea chilled me. “Leading us *where*?”

She shrugged.

That night, the temperature in the house plummeted, making sleep difficult. Down the hall, in the living room, the books sat on the coffee table, untouched. I couldn’t bring myself to open them again, but I couldn’t stop thinking about them either.

When I finally managed to get some shut-eye, my dreams were plagued with visions of twisting staircases and endless bookshelves. In them, I wandered through the study alone, until at last I came to the end of the room, where a figure stood with its back to me, unmoving. When I reached out to touch its shoulder, it turned—and I saw my own face staring back at me, hollow-eyed and gaunt.

I woke with a start, shivering and gasping for air. Beside me, Amara lay undisturbed. I did my best to relax and regain my composure; soon enough, my eyes grew heavy, and I drifted off again into a restless slumber. Before I did, however, I peered at Amara once more, and wondered, briefly, if she was dreaming, too.

**\* \* \* \* \* \***

The following evening, the door moved again. Amara found it this time, positioned in the hallway beside the coat rack. I heard her call my name, panic thinly veiled under her voice.

“Sean, it’s back.”

I stepped out of the kitchen, drying my hands on a dish towel. She stood a few feet away from the door, arms crossed and shoulders tense. I joined her, the faint chill of the hallway brushing against my skin as I stared at the now familiar, cracked blue wood.

“What do we do?” she asked.

I didn’t answer. Instead, I reached for the knob. The air around it felt colder than the rest of the house, and my fingers trembled slightly as I turned it.

This time, the door opened into something entirely different. A vast room stretched out before us, its domed ceiling curving high above our heads. At its center stood a massive antique telescope, its brass frame gleaming faintly in the dim light filtering through the windows.

The floor beneath our feet was made of cold stone, etched with strange symbols that seemed to shift and writhe if I stared at them too long. Around the room were desks piled with star charts and scattered notes, some of them covered in a language I couldn’t decipher.

“This...” Amara’s voice trailed off as she stepped through the door. “This doesn’t make any sense.”

The air seemed thicker inside, our every movement met with resistance. With great effort I approached the telescope, the faint hum of its mechanisms sending vibrations through the floor. When I looked through the lens, I gasped.

The sky it revealed was unlike anything I’d ever seen. Constellations of jagged, unfamiliar stars hung suspended in a black void, their light cold and pale. In the distance, something massive and black pulsed faintly, its surface devouring the light around it. Nearby, a shattered planet spun slowly, its glowing molten core exposed like a raw wound.

“Amara,” I whispered, stepping back. “You need to see this.”

She hesitated before approaching, her hand gripping my arm as she leaned down to peer through the lens. I watched her face shift from curiosity to shock. “This... this isn’t our sky,” she said, her voice barely audible. “Sean, what are we looking at?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted, stepping back toward one of the desks. The scattered notes were covered in intricate sketches of the same stars and planets we’d just seen. Some of the papers contained frantic, scrawled warnings: *“Do not look too long.”* *“The black star sees you.”*

I turned to Amara, who was pacing now, her hands pressed to her temples. “We shouldn’t be here,” she said, her voice cracking. “Whatever this place is, it’s not meant for us.”

I wanted to agree with her, but something about the telescope called to me. It wasn’t just curiosity—it was *compulsion*, an invisible thread drawing me toward the lens.

The longer we stayed, the stronger its influence became. The thrum of the telescope grew louder; below, the symbols on the floor glowed faintly, their shifting patterns more pronounced now. My skin crawled with the sensation of being watched.

And then, I saw it.

It wasn’t through the telescope, but in the corner of my vision—something vast and dark moving beyond the windows. I turned quickly, but there was nothing there. Just the faint glimmer of alien constellations.

“Did you see that?” I asked, my voice unsteady.

Amara shook her head, her arms wrapped tightly around herself. “See what?”

“I thought I saw something... outside.”

“There’s nothing out there,” she said, though her voice wavered. “Sean, we need to leave. *Now*.”

As we made our way back to the door, I felt an inexplicable heaviness settle over me, as though the room itself was reluctant to let us go. The air grew frigid, and the hum of the telescope seemed to follow us, vibrating through the walls and into my bones.

We stepped through the doorway and slammed it shut behind us. For a long moment, neither of us spoke. The hallway was silent, the pale blue door standing innocuously in its frame.

Amara turned to me, her face ashen. “We can’t keep doing this,” she said. “It’s not just a door, Sean. It’s... *dangerous*.”

I nodded, though the words felt hollow. The images from the telescope burned in my mind—the black star, the shattered planet, the movement beyond the windows. Whatever the door was, it wasn’t finished with us yet. And deep down, I wasn’t sure if I wanted it to be.

That night, insomnia set in. Unable to sleep, I sketched the constellations we’d seen, my hand moving almost of its own accord. Each star and planet came to life on the page, jagged lines and stark contrasts capturing the alien beauty of what we’d witnessed.

When Amara found me in the morning, the sketches covered the kitchen table. She stared at them for a long time, her expression unreadable.

“Sean,” she said finally, her voice soft but firm. “You’re not yourself.”

“I’m fine,” I lied.

“No,” she said, shaking her head. “You’re not. This... *thing*, this door, it’s changing you. And I won’t let it take you. Please, Sean, I can’t lose you. Not like this. Not now.”

Her words cut through me, but I had nothing to say. Instead, I gathered the sketches and stuffed them into a drawer, hiding them from view, but not from my mind.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

The pale blue door appeared again two nights later.

It materialized in the bathroom, refusing to be ignored. After brushing my teeth, I turned to grab a towel, and there it was, its wood ever more warped, its paint cracking audibly, as if straining against the boundaries of reality itself. This time, in its most vile intrusion yet, it had embedded itself in the shower wall, where the tiles should have been.

“Amara,” I called, my voice tight. “It’s back.”

Her footsteps echoed in the hallway before she appeared in the doorway. Her eyes went straight to the door, and I saw her flinch. She knew what I was thinking before I’d spoken a word.

“Sean, don’t,” she whispered. “Please. Don’t open the door.”

I wanted to listen to her. I wanted to pull her out of the bathroom, lock the door behind us, and pretend it didn’t exist. But the door had other ideas. With each passing moment I felt it pulling at me ever more incessantly, tugging at the edge of my thoughts, urging me closer.

“We need to see what’s inside,” I said, though the words felt like they belonged to someone else. “If we keep running from it, it’ll never stop.”

“Please, Sean, no,” Amara said, shaking her head. “It’s not going to stop anyway. Opening it just makes it worse. Please, leave it alone.”

Her words hung in the air. For a moment, I considered what she’d said. But then my hand moved, almost of its own accord, reaching for the doorknob as it had so many times before. It felt cold, almost wet, under my fingers—and unsettlingly familiar.

“Sean, no!” Amara shouted, sobbing in protest. But it was too late.

The door swung open.

The hallway beyond was narrow and dimly lit, the walls lined with mirrors that stretched from floor to ceiling. Their surfaces gleamed faintly, reflecting the pale light from somewhere far ahead. The air smelled faintly of mildew, and the floor beneath our feet was cold and damp,

Amara grabbed my arm, her nails digging into my skin. “We shouldn’t be here,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Let’s just go back.”

I nodded, but my feet carried me forward anyway. The mirrors were pristine at first, reflecting us as we crept through the hallway. But as we moved deeper, the reflections began to shift.

In one mirror, my reflection lagged behind me, its movements delayed as though it were struggling to keep up. In another, Amara’s reflection glanced over its shoulder, its eyes wide with fear. I reached out to touch one of the mirrors, but Amara grabbed my wrist.

“Don’t!” she cried. “What if it... what if it traps you?”

“Relax,” I said, lowering my hand. “It’s just glass.” Even as the words left my mouth, I wasn’t sure I believed them.

We kept moving, the hallway growing colder with each step. The mirrors became more distorted, their surfaces warping and twisting as though alive. One showed me as a child, standing alone in a dark room I didn’t recognize. Another showed Amara, but her face was cadaverous, her eyes sunken and hollow.

“Sean,” she said suddenly, stopping in her tracks. “Look at this one. We’re not in it.”

I turned to see what she meant. The mirror beside her reflected only the hallway—no me, no Amara, just an empty stretch of stone and glass. A chill ran down my spine, and I pulled her closer.

“Let’s keep going,” I said. “We’re almost through.”

I didn’t believe that either.

At the far end of the hallway, a single mirror stood cracked and jagged. As we approached, I heard a faint, muffled voice coming from the other side.

I froze. “Do you hear that?”

Amara nodded. “It’s... it’s *you*.”

The voice grew louder as we got closer, and I realized she was right. It *was* my voice, though it was distorted, broken by static and echo. I stepped forward, staring into the broken glass.

My reflection stared back at me, its face twisted in anguish. It pressed its hands against the glass, its mouth moving in silent desperation. And then the sound came through, faint but unmistakable.

“Help me,” it said, its voice a choked whisper. “You’ve got to help me.”

“Sean,” Amara said, her voice trembling. “We need to leave.”

But I couldn’t move. My reflection’s eyes locked onto mine, and I felt a strange pull, like it was dragging me into the glass. I raised my hand, my fingers trembling as they hovered inches from the surface.

“Don’t!” Amara grabbed my arm, pulling me back. The moment she touched me, the mirror shifted. My reflection smiled, its mouth curling into a cruel grin. Behind it, the hallway began to buckle and collapse, the glass warping and splintering as darkness bled in from the edges.

“Run!” I shouted, grabbing her hand.

We sprinted back the way we came, the mirrors shattering around us. The sound was deafening, a cacophony of exploding glass and echoing laughter. The hallway grew darker with each step, the faint light from the door ahead sputtering like a dying flame.

The ground beneath us shifted, becoming slippery and uneven. Amara stumbled, and I caught her just as a shard of glass fell from above, shattering inches from her feet.

“Keep going!” I shouted, pulling her forward. The door was just ahead, its frame glowing faintly in the encroaching darkness.

We burst through it together, slamming it shut behind us. For a moment, we stood there, gasping for air, our hands still clasped tightly. The bathroom was silent, the pale blue door standing innocently in the shower wall as though nothing had happened.

Amara turned to me, her eyes filled with tears. “Sean,” she said, her voice breaking. “We can’t keep doing this. It’s going to [kill ](https://www.creepypastastories.com/authors/craig-groshek)[us.”](https://www.youtube.com/user/chillingtaleswi)
