Hello again! I’m continuing to write my story of how I became the king of hell. Where were we? Oh yes:



When I was alive, I was a freak. I was never masculine and if anything it was a slow descent into homosexuality for me. It was something I hated about myself at first, but grew to love. I am gay. I am a gay man and I am proud of that. I love men with large muscles and lots of hair on their chest, and I love that I can describe who I am attracted to and why as a hetero man would do with a woman he fancies. I was doomed when I was born, my genetic makeup made me a man but I looked as if I were an ideal woman. I was a man, I am a man - But the world would confuse me for the other, so I was often bullied for my perceived ‘femininity’ they wrote in blood-red letters - Large enough to be seen - A nothing that hurt to remember - Screaming in pain.



That night, day? There are no day-night cycles in hell, so I don’t know the proper description, because those in hell have no rest day and night. I think I’ll just create a word for it, hmmm. What to call it? I don’t know, I don’t know. Maybe? No, that’s stupid. Oh that’s good, I got it! Smid. A stupid word but whatever. That smid I went to sleep - My dream, a memory of when I was alive - sparks the light of pain that comes from remembering. If you’re looking for a way to get your hands dirty, you’ll want to make sure you’re doing it right before you begin.



I’m outside of a seven-eleven - Standing, looking at the fluorescent lights of a blinking sign proclaiming: "OPEN 24 HOURS. ALWAYS AT YOUR SERVICE." - It was cold, the wind whistling in my ears -  I don’t remember why but I had a troubled look on my face with a slight smile on my lips. The corner store seems deserted, it's strange that no one is out. There are usually drunkards out looking for cheap pussy, but not tonight. No one is out - No one but me. My car is nearby. I enter the Seven-Eleven, an audible groan can be heard from the cashier -  A stout man - Thumbing through a porno magazine he must’ve brought from home or bought here, but I don’t see any porno mags for sale. He looks up from his horny haze, spotting me and his face sours, “Hey! You better leave or before I make you leave.” He threatened me like a man used to serving cruel and unusual punishments.



I look at him confused - Cautiously, I calmly ask, “What’d I do?”



He thumbed to another page, staring at me intensely - Eyes like a magnum pistol, "I know your types.” He says, “The druggies. The whores. The scumbags walking these streets, you know: the aids spreaders. I know them all too well. And I can tell just by looking at you, you're one of them.”



He was trapping me into responding negatively so he could have an excuse to call the cops, but I'm not fooled, “Listen man, I just want some cigs, okay?” In this case, I know his ‘type’ too - The human filth. The trash that needs to be thrown out.



“Yeah, I bet you do.” He mutters.



I approach the counter, our eyes meet - All I get is shit from this man. And for what? We look at each other with disgust, but for different reasons. I point to a pack of cigarettes in the back, “Pack of camels.” I say.  The clerk puts down his magazine, turns around, and grabs a pack - As if he were tired, he faces me exhausted. He must not exercise often if this is tiring for him. Or maybe he wasted all his energy on masturbation, I can’t say I would know. The clerk places the cigarettes down and scans them, “$2.50”



I reach into my jacket for my wallet to pay, “Alone for the night?” 



“Not currently.” His face, it looked like it was squinting.



I pull out $3.00 and hand it to him, he takes it and confirms the transaction. Semi-earnestly I said, “Oh, well that’s good.”



With cold eyes his expression darkens, “What? Are you planning on robbing me?”



Then with narrowed eyes and a fake smile, “Oh honey, no, just making small talk.” I shrug nonchalantly. My body language, at least what I was attempting to give off, was an honest and vanilla aura.  It dawns on me, though, that no matter how I act or what I say to this man would calm him down. To him, I was a virus - Aids personified - And to these people, one touch from an ‘aids-man’ is enough to kill you.



The clerk, dumbfounded, gritted teeth, total sheer darkness and hate, “Honey?” He repeats himself, this time with more oomph and anger, “Honey? Who do you think you’re talking to? Some queer? Is that who you think I am?”



I shake my head, “No! No I don’t think you’re one at all!” Oh God, what did I do?



“How about I call the cops and tell them I got some asshole harassing me? Hmm? Whose side do you think they’ll take?”  The bigger this dance of power he’s performing, the more likely I am to not survive it. So I leave before anything could escalate beyond this point.



“Fuck you.” I exit the store with cigarettes in hand. This man - Oh yes, oh he has to die now. But how would I do it? I had to plan it out, a concrete yet improvised method of execution - And it would have to be relatively soon, due to the fact that I can’t predict when the next person will show up. I have to capitalize on the bareness of nothing right now. It was like a silk blanket tickling my head with ideas - This pathetic piece of meat. Granted, we’re all just pieces of meat anyway. If I were to wake him and move him, that would probably be ideal. I walked to the back of the seven-eleven, pulled out a light, and smoked a cig. The nicotine puffed air wafted into the air, creating little smoke clouds - The cigarette burned almost beautifully - Like the Mona Lisa but lethal - I was ingesting poison after all. But the cigarettes calmed me and others who used them - A bitter but appealing addiction. That release of adrenaline, that little joy and energy, and you can't forget about the buzz too. A bit of ash falls - The orange flame of death burns.



The night sky’s stars twinkled far away, a lightbulb just out of reach. It was a calm night, but it wouldn’t be here soon. I can imagine what he’s doing - From outside the bathroom, you can hear him - His heavy grunting, violently masturbating. The sound of meat and lotion clapping together is uncomfortable - His face - His panting, out of breath -  A man who's never exercised. Then, with the magazine covering his crotch - He would probably finish and sit back relieved, his hand covered in semen - A disgusting pig yanking his hog. Most likely he uses the toilet paper to wipe up his mess - He would at least have the decency to do so, at least, I imagine he would. Pulling his pants up and washing his hands in the sink, the warm water erases the evidence - I imagine as he washes his hands, he takes a long look into the dirty mirror he consistently forgets to clean - Seeing himself in the grimy fungus filled glass, a reflection of the filth he is - His own self-made misery.



Most likely he’s going back to his counter. The same one he stood behind - And the same one where this conflict began. It is only logical he would waltz back, where else would he go? And I have to capitalize on him returning, which would mean that he would be closer to the back of the store - Where I am. From there, I would make some noise, banging a blunt object nearby against the trash cans out back. Bang! Bang! The noise, especially at this hour, would be enough to drive a man into a frenzy. Who’s out there? What’s going on? Am I safe? No, no you are not. For this to work,  there has to be a moment of peace before he hears it again - To which he will ignore it out of fear or he would ignore it because it is simply an annoyance to him. Either way, the noise will stop but then start again - And I would knock one of the trash cans over. At this point he will complain and say something to the effect of, “If it’s those damn racoons again, I swear to God.” I think he would say. If this were to go to plan, then he’s coming my way now. Good.



I hid behind a bush, the darkness and thick leaves - A perfect cover. From the corner comes the clerk, his steps nimble and light. He peeks around the back - Watching the clerk - My breathing is heavy and loud - Chest puffing, I am to the point where I’m near hyperventilation. The clerk approaches one of the trash cans that has been knocked over - Inspecting it, confused, his situation fucked. I follow his gaze - The little head turns, I watch - Sensing this was a prime opportunity for an ambush, I smack the clerk over the head using the same blunt object as before - Smack! Crack! Knocking him out. And his fat little body fell, hitting the trash cans - They fell and rolled for a brief minute. This is good, perfect even. My plan had worked, but I am confident it was due to my genius, but luck - I was lucky it worked, and I am fine with that. I have never been the smartest person in the room, and I am not even useful in a discussion. I am simply just someone sitting in the room.



I drag his heavy body to my car, and with an oomph, I place him into my trunk. I drove off into the night. I don’t recall what I did with him that night, my dream ends there.



I woke up from my slumber, eyes groggy. My face was pale and swollen with anxiety — My hair: alien, horrible, and ugly — And I suddenly thought it strange that I had been chosen to fall in love with the devil and the slave of a madman. I stretched my arms, grazing the eerily soft bed of murder I am laying on still. I truly am dead and able to sleep as if I were still alive, hmm. I found that funny somehow - A bit of dark humor in my eyes. I should shower if that’s even an option. Would I need to shower? Maybe, maybe not, but I should if there is one. I get up, throwing the blankets covering me to the side - Standing on the floor, I try to balance - An overwhelming flood of emotions - The revelation of my new world was enough to send me to the floor. This room I already associate with terrible memories, but perhaps I grow past that and gain some positive ones? Maybe.



I walk around the halls of the mansion - Everything seems gothic, broodish. Where is the shower? I continue down the hall, releasing too late that I am lost. But I am not alone anymore at least. Lucifer will find me, yeah. I don’t want to be alone again, abandoned - Those days are ones I would not wish to relive. As I wander the endless maze, in the distance I can smell something heavenly - A buttery smell with hints of seasoning - Like whatever this food is was made by a professional. All I can say is hats off to the chef. I follow that smell like a cartoon character with a pie. I’m getting closer, salivating. Can I even eat? I don’t know but I don’t care. Closer now, I am at an open door - And who is inside but Lucifer - Sitting at the end of a long table with a plate of some meat and potatoes. It’s like he’s enchanted by whatever he’s eating, but he has no manners with the way he stuffs himself. This is the dining room.



I walked into the room, quickly overtaken by the almost comically expensive decorations. The Devil's dining room was filled with fine rugs covering the floor, and walls with rich tapestries. A crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling, casting its light over the long table covered in silken cloth. It was a place of luxury and decadence. A place where one would expect to find the Devil himself.  What kind of meat is he eating? Is it pork? Chicken? Steak? I don’t know. It smells good, though. I almost wish he prepared one for me, but granted - He couldn’t have known if I'd be awake at the time.



I chuckle, “Mmm, whatever you’re eating smells good.” I take another whiff of the delicious meat - Eyes shamefully closed in on his plate. I approach awkwardly - Still blushing over his angelic beauty - And I sit in the chair next to him. His alpha aura was very much still on display, and I am his submissive. 



He kisses my cheek and I look at him, It's amazing. The Devil pokes a slice, bringing it to his mouth and eating it, “A little salt and pepper goes a long way.” Laughing as he goes in for another piece. His eyes darkened, he thought of something else to say, he laughed to himself, "If you’ve been around as long as I have, and you don’t know how to cook, you know what I think you should do?” He asks, a curling smile forms on his face - The way he’s looking at me right now; It is very kind. I'm selfish, I don’t deserve his attention.



“No, what?” I ask flirtatiously.



The Devil leaned in close, putting one of his hands on my thigh, gently groping it - Flames shoot out of his eyes, a seductive darkness. My face was red and burnt as he says quietly, "I think you should kill yourself.” There is no sarcasm in his voice. 



It was a shock to my system. I am speechless - Stuttering, I try to change the conversation - His hand is still touching my thigh, massaging it; I like it. His sweet touch sending shivers down my spine - An erotic display of ownership. He’s getting closer now to my crotch, how far is he going to go? Closer now, closer - My legs started to stiffen as I stuttered, “It smells kind of buttery, what did you season it with?” Desperately trying to ignore the electric tingle of his touch.



“I can tell you how I cooked it if you want.” I breathe slowly, he mirrors me, “Do you want that?” He asks, trapping me with a simple question. What would he say if I said no? Would the best outcome be saying yes? Most likely, yes is good, yes gets you far. Just say yes, that’s what I was taught in church. Just say yes and accept your sin you vile sinner.



“Y-Yes.” I stammer, “Please tell me.”



He disappeared in thought, ripping up words and stitching them back together, “So to begin,” he explains, “You want to pat and dry the meat, preferably with paper towels, because it’ll reduce the oil splatter. Then you’ll season it liberally with salt and pepper on both sides. Next you’re going to heat the pan, adding only about 2 teaspoons of olive oil. Let that sit because the oil needs to heat.  Are you following?” He asks.



“Uh-huh!” I nod my head. It’s sexy how knowledgeable he is about cooking.



“Great, so when the oil is right and hot, you add the meat and it's best to use tongs for this part. Sear each side for about 4 - 5 minutes to get a nice brown crust. Then you turn the meat on its sides to sear the edges for about a minute at a time, add a bit of butter and garnish. It doesn't matter what, it's honestly up to the chef, but you want to have the butter melt into the steak. Once the steak is done, remove from the pan, and let it rest for about 5 minutes.” It was effortless in how he explained it, his subconscious timing perfectly when he spoke, like a whisper of magic words on what to say.



I couldn't help but smile because he looked so cute. However, once he explained how he cooked whatever the meat was, I built up more courage, so I asked him, “You kept calling it just meat, but what is it? Pork, steak, some type of demon?”



The Devil looked flustered, swaying slowly, laughing,  “Oh, none of those” He says, “It’s none of those.”



“If it’s none of those, is it some type of exotic animal?” My brain was churning and turning as many rational explanations as it could. Maybe it was a turtle? A lion? If it’s not steak, chicken, pork, or a demon, then it’s something I’ve never tasted.



The Devil leaned back and looked at the plate, his eyes shifting back and forth - Thinking, conniving - He looked back to me and poked the plate with his finger, “You can smell this, right?” He asked, never breaking eye contact - Dodging the question completely.



Nervous, I looked away, “I can smell it, yes.” 



“Which means you can touch, yes? You can touch it?” His gaze deepened, a more dark expression.



“That would make sense, I suppose.” I mutter.



“Touch it.” He said, “I want you to touch it.” His voice commanded me and so I did.



“I-I can feel it.” I stutter.



“So you can touch it and you can smell it, meaning you can probably eat it.” Can a soul even eat? I’m flustered, staring down at the meat. It still smells wonderful. “Go on,” his voice has pride behind it, “At least try it, it’s one of the most flavorful things in all of existence.” He meant it, there were no lies in his tone. “Here, I’ll cut you a piece.” And so he cut a tiny portion out and guided it to my mouth, “Just try it.” He says charmingly like a car salesman. I bite down. A rush of colorful flavors. The meat was the most deliciously explosive thing I have ever tasted. A little tender and fatty - Juices bursting in your mouth. It was all kinds of decadence. It was the kind of dish you can just munch on all day if you’re willing to sacrifice your waistline. It was all the juicy deliciousness you’d expect from a good piece of meat. 



In a fit of pure hysteric joy, the Devil laughs so hard he falls out of his chair, grabbing his stomach and tears fall from his eyes. “Hahaha!” He can barely breathe, “You-You just-” He rolls on the floor, “You just ate a 5 year old girl!” He’s laughing even harder now, there is no air entering, only leaving. His eyes nearly bulging out of his head. That laugh, I was torn, slowly it was cold in the air, whatever light was emanating was now dimmed. If I could tear off my skin and throw it away I would. I vomited up the child meat, the flavor served up once again as it bitterly touched my tongue again - On the floor, a child, that poor child; I’m sorry I ate you. I was in shock.



Seeing my expression, the Devil shot up, gathering himself to his feet, “She was really easy to catch.” He adjusts his coat, “And the best part about it was telling her exactly, detail by detail, what her last night alive would entail. Her eyes were all bugging out, her face was just wet with tears. This girl was just trembling, knowing she was going to be cut up and eaten, what a glorious sight that was. How I savored every little emotion on her face. And you know what? She tastes pretty damn good.” The Devil rejoicing in violence for violence called to him. Violence was his servant, his bitch boy. And he commanded violence, and through violence he ruled a monster.



It took me a second for anything to come out of my mouth, trembling - My anxiety is back in full force, a sadness turned to fear, "You’re sick” I stammer.



The Devil wiped his tears haughtily, “Oh, you, I already know that. I know that very well.” He put his seat back up and sat down - Taking my hand. “You’ll get used to it.” And if on cue, like he had a prepared speech, he began, “Natural selection. If one person is stronger than another, do they not hold superiority over them? If they can outrun them, if they can beat them and bash them, then are they not superior?” He squeezed my hand tight, “A predator does not care for what the prey thinks, they strike, and if they can't escape or defend themselves, then they deserve to die.”



Without thinking, I asked simply, “Why?”



“Because I’m Lucifer Motherfucking Morningstar and you’re not, you fucking nerd. Ha!” He jokingly said, “But,” he continued, “Let me tell you that it kills to have the voice of everything in the universe talking in your head at all times, because I know every fact ever, and do you know what that’s like? Voices screaming at you every second? The sick depraved shit humans get up to? I’m incapable of turning it off. That was one of the punishments inflicted on me when I fell from heaven. Every second of my life I want to scream, slap my head and groan out of misery. 4.4 BILLION lives, decisions made. The bad, oh they’re the worst. I watch them, I’m forced to; I am the king of this forsaken place, the top dog. I wish it didn’t have to be this way, and you might be thinking to yourself, Guy, do I regret what I did to earn myself here? No. If I could do it over again, I wouldn’t change a thing. My father, God, he’s nothing more than a symbol of power than an actual being. I don’t know if you’ll ever get the chance of meeting him, but he’s not the fun type. I can assure you of that.” Even now, after what he did, he’s beautiful.



“Can I admit something, Lucifer?” I’m trembling in his presence.



“Of course.” He says.



“I’m,” is this going to sound bad when I say it? “I’m honestly kind of relieved I didn’t eat your dog.” I sound terrible, I am terrible for thinking that.



Cocking his head, the Devil’s face isn’t its expressive self - Replaced with a look so strange, “What are you talking about?” He asks in confusion; it seems genuine.



Am I misremembering yesterday? “Um,” I pause, “You, uh, you killed your dog.” My voice is weaker than how I thought it’d be.



He squinted his eyes, looking at me as if I were a moron, “Why would I kill my own dog?” He asks softly - Posing the question of I am truly crazy.



“I’m sorry?” A lack of uncertainty in my voice. What was happening? He killed that dog, he did. I saw him stomp it to death.



“Why would I kill my dog?” He asks again. He seems concerned for me. He stopped holding my hand and shuffled in his chair, like he was readying himself for something. “Here boy!” He claps his hands, “Charlie, boy, come here!” And to both my surprise and horror, Charlie the demon dog, came trotting into the dining room - Setting himself next to the Devil, but more importantly, next to me. “Hehe, see? I would never harm my dog. You’re crazy\~!” His voice is mocking and flirty. What the hell is this dog? No, no, no, it can’t be real. He’s fucking with me, isn’t he? He’s got to be - But what I simply misremembered what happened? I don’t know.



The Devil must’ve seen my face, my distraught distrustful face, because then he said, “Look at him, look at his fur, look at how his chest thumps up and down, the way he pants. Is that not a living dog to you?” He then took my hand by force, making me pet the dog; I could feel the dog's fur, the texture of its fur through my fingers - Thick and kind of coarse and wiry. I feel stupid and unsure of myself. Can I be trusted enough to be a reliable narrator? It seems not.



“It’s real. It’s a real dog.” I hated admitting that.



“See? I didn’t kill the dog, you were probably just stressed from yesterday and your brain made it up. It happens, it’s okay.” His gaze is strong and full of hope, sweet like a fresh strawberry.



“I-I’m sorry.” I stutter, looking down, my head in shame.



“Hey, hey, come here,” he scoops me into his arms, “No need to apologize, okay?” I feel safe being held by him, it’s nice. He tilts my chin up to his face, “Can you do something for me?” I can imagine where this is going. He’s going to want me to stop crying or something like that. There is a second of silence but enough to leave an impression, he forms a cheeky smile and says calmly, “I’m going to need you to kill the dog.” I felt like I was suspended, flying without gravity. Then he pulled out a gun out of nowhere and placed it into my free hand, looking at me like if I didn’t use it, he would - The eyes of horror and chaos.



I pleaded to the best of my ability, “Are you insane?” And he retorted immediately, “We’ve already established that.” 



The Devil repeated his words, emphasizing them, “I shoot YOU or you shoot the DOG. Capisce?” But what about the no-kill rule? Wait, a loophole. As long as I don’t die, he can torture me however he wants. Fuck! I hesitated - He didn’t like that, so he moved the hand with the gun toward the dog. I wanted to drop the gun, but something, yes something was keeping in my hand. The Devil’s strength, his power over me - I couldn’t fight, he had me, “All you have to do is aim, shoot, and POW! Dead. Just like that.” His voice was vindictive and cold.



“N-No!” I stammered, pleading, fighting a losing battle, “I won’t do it.”



“Are you sure?” My hands were not of my own, putting the gun on the temple of the dog’s head. He breathed down my neck, and suddenly, I couldn't breathe. I'm out of breath. I’m going to pass out.



“Why are you making me do this?” A small whimper exits from me, a dissonant sound of pity.



He was quick with a reply, “Because there’s nothing better than forcing someone to do something they don’t want to do.



“Please no.” I plead, desperate.



“Oh, yes, baby!” He said, “He’s right there. Pull the trigger.”



“No…” I pleaded again, my voice soft.



“Pull the trigger.” He was getting tired of me, I could tell.



“I won’t do it!”



“PULL THE FUCKING TRIGGER!” He screamed, nearly deafening me permanently.



But I wouldn’t do it - With what little control I had, I fought for control of the gun, to let the poor dog go, but he had me at every turn. I fought like hell to get the gun away, and he used his body weight to keep the gun pointed at the dog. It was a standoff, a wrestling match - Two fighters battling for control. We fought, I fought, the dog watched innocently; it didn’t know. That poor dog. We were reaching a stalemate when suddenly - BANG! The gun fires and to my horror, laying in a pool of blood at both our feet was Charlie, his head exploded. It was sickening. Oh God, I just killed a dog. Holy shit…!



I can't, “I…” No, no, no, “You made me do it.”



The Devil cackled, “Haha! No I didn’t! I let go of you at the last second. That was all you!” He slapped his knee in joyous laughter. “You were right the whole time. I did kill the dog. I brought it back to life mid conversation just to fuck with you, AND THEN YOU KILLED IT AGAIN!”



“Oh my God, no!” Oh fuck…



“God’s in heaven, you’re in my world, bitch.” The Devil then grabbed me by the back of my hair - He was strong and fast, causing painful tears to fill my eyes, and slammed my face as he could onto the table - THWAP! My face shatters, bones cracked, my eyes swollen - The size of an orange. Every fiber, even the smallest, were sending shock waves - An explosion of circulating pain. My mind was in shock. It made my body numb to everything. He waited a second, cruelly, and then he slammed my face down again and again and again and again and again and then he let me slump to the floor. I crashed, unable to move - I was fodder for mutilation if he wanted to. He stood over me, his shadow blocking out everything, my swollen eyes aided to his intimidating aura. “You’re just a dog who follows orders.” He picks me up by the dog collar, “But here’s the thing about dogs, they have owners, and guess what? I own you.”



The Devil throws me to the floor, “All fours, right now!” He demands. I can barely move. He kicks me over and over again, “What did I say? Get on your hands and feet, now.” With what little strength I had, I slowly got on all fours, this is so degrading, “Good dog. Now walk.” He commands. I barely manage to move, the Devil readies his foot for kicking. “You’re missing a crucial part of being a dog. Bark for me.”



I let out a soft whimper, but not loud enough for him, “Bark damn it! Like I just came home from a vacation, bark!” I make a somewhat louder whimper, “Bark…! Bark…!” I'm pitiful.



“Like you mean it!”



I let out what power was inside me, “Bark! Bark Bark!” He likes it, “There you go! More! More!” He applauds me, clapping his hands together like a seal.



“Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark!” I'm trying my best.



“Good,” his voice charming like the temptation of drugs, “You're such a good doggy, how about a treat?” He gets in front of me, I’m looking at his legs, I look up to his eyes - A devious lust. He grabbed me by the hair again, tilting my head up towards his crotch. With his free hand he unzipped his pants and pulled his underwear down, “Go on. Have a taste of Daddy\~!” I couldn’t consent when he forced his penis into my mouth. I was dazed - Exhausted - Injured - A human pocket pussy.  I can feel him hitting the back of my throat, I gulk, eyes wet. He moans like an animal in heat, there was no rhythmic movement in how he was thrusting - pumping harder and harder. He finishes, cumming into my mouth - His hot fluid not turning me on, in fact, it was the opposite. How could he do that? I felt violated. I was too tired to think further - His semen dripped out of my mouth. He zips up his pants and looks down at me, “I want you to remember that I control everything you do. I am your God. Anything I want you to do I will into existence, got it?”



“Yes, I got it.” Right now, I’m a broken toy.



“So when I tell you to shoot a dog, you shoot the fucking dog, okay?”



“Y-Yes, sir.” I answered.



“Good.” The Devil waves his hand and I'm fully healed, but I can still feel the pain, “Now, we have a movie to shoot.” I was mortified.



I made to suit up into the costume. The two of us were in an entertainment room - Lights, camera, action - The whole shabang! The Devil tended to the proper broadcasting setup necessary for his snuff movie to work. “When I turn this on, just know all of Chicago is going to see you but the ending, okay? Only one place is going to see the ‘ending’. And the people in there are not meant to live, got it?” I nod my head, why would he select Chicago? “If you’re worried about getting noticed, I am going to put a hex over you so no one other than you and I will know. The people of Chicago are only going to know about the broadcast, not the film. The broadcast is essentially our alibi.”



“Can other angels know about the hex? You know, would they sense it?” I ask, adjust my mask. This thing is so stiff.



“They should only know about the broadcast, and they’ll think of it as a harmless prank, not a distraction for murder.” He reassures me, putting his on my shoulder briefly, before going back to work.



“Are the people bad?” I feel a little guilty, but I’ve killed people before. I’m a hypocrite. 



“Some of the worst,” he says. “Neo-Nazi fuckwits, the perfect targets.”



“And why is that?” I think I know the answer already.



“Cause’ no one will feel bad with them being dead. They’ll be forgotten about the next day. If anything, I’m just sending them to hell early. Taking out the trash.” He smiles, his eyes sparkle, “Ah! There we go.” He turns to me, “Now remember, your only job is to kill. Before that, just do whatever you feel like on camera.”



“Quick question,” I say, “If I’m here, how am I going to be there too?”



“Simple: the portal from here to there is this TV here. You just hop on through and you’ll plop right in the land of the living.” He adjusts my tie to his desired length, “Looking good, you're going to be a slash-star, I can feel it.” The Devil moves away from the frame - Only I am on camera. The TV turns on, perfect definition.  I can see the inside of the bar; it has a certain aura to it that makes you feel dirty and grimy, giving you the sense that something bad could happen to you at any time - Patrons wearing racist garments, some leather and some cloth, but all of them, every single one, looks like the best white trash has to offer - Gross, disgusting, like literal trash came to life. They all have tattoos with symbols including: Swastikas, black people hanging, hell fire, 14 and 88, etc.  I’m fired up now, a rising wolf from within.



They speak as if they never passed kindergarten, uneducated, hateful - Burn them, burn them. I can hear one of them speak, he says drunkenly, “I just fucking hate these god damn stupid bums thinking they own this city!”



A customer next to him responds, “Yeah! Fuck em! They don’t own shit because they’re too dumb to know what to do with it!”



The first bigot laughs, “Damn right, brother, bums don’t know nothin’. I bet they don’t know what true patriotism is.” He drinks some more. These men, oh you hateful bastards.



Bigot 2 nudges bigot 1, “Brother, you are spitting some serious truth right now.” He also takes a drink. The two men laugh.



Bigot 1 smiles, “I know, brother. I know.”



From their perspective, in the bar, the TV in the bar starts flickering -  Playing static, loud - Grating. The patrons are confused.



Bigot 2 turns his body towards the TV, “Damn TV done not working right.” Bigot 1 does the same, “We should fix it, brother, as a gift for all the lovely patriots in here.” Bigot 2 suggests.



Bigot 1 slaps bigot 2's back, “Hell yeah!” Bigot 2 does the same, “Hell yeah!”



The bigots approach the TV - Their faces are repulsive. Bigot 1 motions for bigot 2 to get on his back so he can get enough height to reach the TV, “Hop on.”



Bigot 2 cringes with disgust, “Hell no, that’s gay as fuck. I got a better solution.” So bigot 2 throws a beer bottle at the TV; it shatters, spraying glass and beer everywhere.



Bigot 1 looks at bigot 2 like he was an absolute idiot, “What made you think that was a good idea?”



Bigot 2 shrinks with anger, “Well, it was a better alternative to whatever queer shit you were trying to pull.”



Bigot 1 motions his hand towards the TV, “It’s in a worse state than when we came over to it.”



Bigot 2 yells at bigot 1, “It’s a goddamn TV, they aren’t expensive. Hell, crack addicted bums have all sorts of them in their shitty little ghettos.”



Bigot 1 palms his face, taking a deep breath, “You are such a dumb motherfucker.” He mutters to himself. Bigot 2 does not hear it.



The Devil gives me the signal to begin, I start. “That does it! He’s a freakin’ nerd! Hehehe.” Suddenly a figure, me, begins to appear on the TV - A man in a suit, a brown suit and a Max Headroom mask.



Bigot 1 hits bigot 2, “What the hell did you do?” 



Bigot 2 backs up, “I don’t know! Why are you hitting me?”



My face stares back like a predator toying with its prey, “Yeah, I think I’m better than Chuck Swirsky. Frickin’ liberal.” I bend over, only my shoulder and plastic hair is visible, “Oh, Jesus.” I laugh like a hyena, “Here we go.” And I pop back up on screen, “Yeah!” I display a can of Coke, “Catch the wave!” I dropped the coke can and leaned into the camera, my face nearly smooshing the screen. I step back grunting, “Your love is fading! Waaah!”



I hum the tune to Clutch Cargo, “I still see the X.”



I continued humming the tune. I begin to stop humming and panic in character, “Ahh! My files!” Throwing a tantrum, I shake violently, “Oh, I just made a giant masterpiece for all the greatest world newspaper nerds!”



I laugh - dipping off screen, I reappear with a baseball catching glove, “My brother is wearing the other one…” I look at the screen hauntingly, “It’s dirty!” I put on the glove, “I’m going to put mine on fine. Off!” I take off the glove and throw it. The camera cuts and comes back to me with my bare butt exposed getting spanked by a fly swatter by the Devil, “They’re coming to get me!” I cry.



The Devil is hard to hear through the TV, but I can hear him and in a playful voice he says, “Bend over, bitch!” I play along, “Ahhhh! Don’t do it! Nooooo!” The TV cuts to black, is it over? No, of course not, but they don’t know that.



“Well that was weird as shit.” Said Bigot 1.



“Agreed.” Says Bigot 2



The TV cuts back, and I reveal the chainsaw, “I’m coming for you nerds!” I leap out of the TV, enter the bar, and fall to the floor and land on my feet. Everyone in the bar panics - fear is prominent on all of their faces, “Frickin’ bigots, bitch! I’m gonna make another masterpiece for all the world’s hall monitors!”



I rev the chainsaw and it starts. Immediately people flock to the exit and entrance trying to escape, but the doors won’t open. There is a significant amount of cursing from the patrons, a lot of screaming for help, and a lot of prayers. I rush around the room like a man on meth, fast but my movements are incoherent -  dashing and slashing, dismembering and disemboweling one after another. Like a phantom I disappear and reappear, a black fog, poof, and there I am cutting you to bits.  Many try to fight me, but using brute force, I am able to quickly overpower them. I throw a man at a wall so hard he explodes. I set another on fire, and spin a man so fast he turns into a red mist. The bar is destroyed, painted red and guts and limbs and everything a human would’ve had if they weren’t torn with a chainsaw was on the floor. I stopped the chainsaw.



In my ear I can hear the Devil, “AND cut! Guy, you were perfect. I knew you would kill!” I like it when he praises me. He should do it more; it’s nice.



“Thanks.” I’m blushing under the mask.



“It’s going to be a minute to send you back here, cause the beer that hit the TV is messing with it big time, so just chill while I fix this.” He is annoyed. “Oh yeah! Before I bring you back, please grab hold of some of your handiwork. I’m feeling a bit hungry.” I pick up some of the dismembered body parts for him to later consume. And so I wait. I walk behind the bar and browse the liquor available. They have a nice selection of whiskeys and scotch and beer. I grab a bottle of scotch and sit down on a bloodied bar stool. I open the bottle and drink straight for the source as I wait for Lucifer to bring me back. I wonder how long opening a portal from hell to here takes? I ponder that as the liquor tickles my taste buds.



BOOM! 



Wait what? Did something explode? It sounded like either lightning struck something or a car exploded. A loud kaboom. And then, suddenly, I can hear a rumbling sound outside. It’s getting closer, closer now, and then it stops. The door rattles, the knob turns,  the door opens. In steps a large man. He was so big, he had to crouch down just to enter. From only 5 seconds I can tell this man is a warrior, one that seems to have fought for centuries.



“Are you Guy Morrision?” The man asks.



“Yes, I am. And you are?” I ask.



“My name is Saint Michael, and you’re under arrest.”
