I wasn’t supposed to be there. Company parties weren’t my thing, but when your manager casually drops a “team bonding is important,” you don’t really have a choice. I figured I’d make an appearance, stay just long enough to check the box, and slip out when no one was looking.

And then I saw her.

She wasn’t like anyone else in the room. There was a stillness about her, a quiet gravity that seemed to draw people in. I remember the way she laughed—light, unguarded, genuine. It cut through the dull hum of small talk and bad jokes like a spark. For a moment, I just stood there, watching. I didn’t mean to stare, but something about her made it impossible not to.

When her gaze met mine, I froze. She didn’t just look at me; she *saw* me, as though she could peel away the layers of detachment I’d carefully built over the years. I felt exposed, vulnerable, and yet, for some reason, I couldn’t look away.

It wasn’t long before we ended up in a conversation, though I couldn’t tell you how. Maybe she approached me, or maybe I stumbled into her orbit without realizing it. All I know is that the usual scripts—“What do you do?” “How long have you been with the company?”—faded into something else entirely. She told me her name was Lily, and that she worked as a designer, sketching and creating visuals for the same pharmaceutical company where I designed precision needles. Her world was all about colors and aesthetics, while mine revolved around cold, unyielding metal.

I remember her teasing me about how serious I looked, joking that I seemed like the kind of guy who “measures everything twice and cuts it once.” She wasn’t wrong, but the way she said it made me laugh. And I didn’t laugh often, not like that.

The night blurred after that, the two of us gravitating toward each other even as the party began to wind down. We ended up on the quieter side of the room, where the music was a distant hum, and the glow from the overhead lights felt softer. She leaned in, a glass of something red in her hand, and said, “You’re not like the others here, are you? You seem… different.”

Her words stayed with me long after we exchanged numbers and said our goodbyes. It wasn’t just what she said, but how she said it—like she *meant* it, like she saw something in me that I hadn’t seen in myself for years.

The weeks that followed felt like stepping into a world I didn’t know existed. Lily and I became inseparable, her light bleeding into every corner of my life. We couldn’t have been more different. She was all chaos and color, while I was a man of angles, equations, and certainty. And yet, somehow, we fit.

I’d never noticed how gray my life had been until she started filling it with hues I couldn’t even name. She’d drag me to art shows, thrift shops, and parks, weaving stories about the things she saw, the lives they might have lived. She made me notice details I’d otherwise have ignored: the faint cracks in a sidewalk that resembled spiderwebs, the way sunlight caught in a stranger’s hair, or the uneven hum of a street musician’s guitar.

At home, she was just as vibrant. Our tiny apartment became her canvas. The kitchen table—once empty and cold—was now a mess of sketchbooks, paints, and pencils. She’d sit there for hours, leaning over her work, brow furrowed in concentration, while I watched from the couch, fascinated by the way she moved.

“You keep me grounded, Lewis,” she said one night, her voice soft as she worked on yet another sketch. “Sometimes I feel like I’m spinning off in a million directions, but you… you’re my rock.”

I didn’t tell her how much that scared me—how afraid I was that my world, all sharp edges and precision, would eventually feel too dull for her. But if she noticed, she never said anything. She just kept pulling me out of my shell, showing me the beauty I’d been too blind to see.

And then there was Milo.

Lily came home one day cradling a small, battered black cat in her arms. He was missing an eye, his fur was matted, and he had a limp in his back leg. I winced the moment I saw him.

“Don’t look at him like that,” she said, her tone sharp. “He’s a survivor.”

She set him down gently on the couch, stroking his fur with a tenderness that made my chest ache. “Milo’s seen things we can’t even imagine,” she murmured. “That kind of pain… it changes you. But he’s still here. He’s resilient. That makes him closer to something divine.”

I didn’t understand what she meant by that, not really. To me, he was just a stray, a sad reminder of the cruelty in the world. But to Lily, he was sacred, almost holy. She called him her “martyr,” a creature who had endured suffering but refused to break.

At first, Milo and I kept our distance. He was wary of me, and I didn’t mind keeping him at arm’s length. But over time, I noticed things—how he’d sit silently at Lily’s feet while she worked, or how he’d watch me with that one, unblinking yellow eye. 

Lily, of course, adored him. She said he was a bridge to something greater, a connection to the divine through the pain he’d survived. I didn’t believe her, but I couldn’t help but notice the way Milo seemed to understand her in a way I never could.

The day started like any other. I left Lily in the kitchen, her coffee untouched as she hunched over her sketchbook, absorbed in some new design. I kissed the top of her head before heading out, muttering something about a meeting I couldn’t miss. She barely looked up, but her soft hum of acknowledgment stayed with me as I closed the door behind me.

At work, my world was iron-carbon diagrams and precise calculations. It was comfortable, predictable—everything my life had been before her. My phone was on silent, buried deep in my pocket, as I presented a new design to the team. I wasn’t thinking about her, not consciously, but her laugh still lingered in the back of my mind, a ghostly echo of that morning.

It wasn’t until hours later, when the meeting ended, that I checked my phone. A missed call from Lily. Just one.

I didn’t think much of it at first. She rarely called unless it was something important, but I figured it could wait until I got home. Then the second call came, not from her, but from an unfamiliar number. I answered, distracted, still packing up my notes.

“Is this Lewis Reed?” the voice on the other end asked, calm but cold.

“Yes,” I said, already sensing that something was wrong.

“There’s been an accident. Your wife—Lily Reed—was involved in a collision. She was brought to Mercy General.”

The rest of the words blurred together: “head-on,” “drunk driver,” “critical condition.” Each one felt like a punch, knocking the air out of my lungs. I didn’t remember leaving the office, didn’t remember the drive to the hospital. All I could hear was the steady hum of those words in my head, looping endlessly.

By the time I got there, it was too late.

The doctor was kind, or at least he tried to be. He explained that she’d been pinned in the wreckage, her body crushed under twisted metal. They’d done everything they could, but there wasn’t enough time.

“She held on as long as she could,” he said, his voice distant and clinical. “I’m sorry.”

It was only later, standing in the sterile, fluorescent-lit hallway, that I realized the missed call from Lily had come just minutes before the accident. My stomach churned as I stared at the screen, her name still there, mocking me. I’d been sitting in a meeting, talking about material stress limits, while she’d been reaching out, her final moments slipping away.

The funeral was a blur of murmured condolences and hollow platitudes. I stood by her casket, staring at the polished wood, unable to breathe. People came and went, their voices blending into white noise, but I barely noticed them. All I could hear was her laugh, echoing in my mind, tangled with the endless loop of her missed call.

Afterward, I tried to go back to my routines. Work, food, sleep. But the silence in the apartment was deafening. Everything was still exactly as she’d left it—her mug on the counter, her sketchbook open to a half-finished design. Milo wandered the halls like a shadow, his unblinking gaze a constant reminder of her absence.

I could have answered. I should have answered. But I didn’t.

And now, I would never hear her voice again.

Her sketchbook remained open on the kitchen table, the pencil lying where she’d left it. I’d glance at it sometimes, but I couldn’t bring myself to look inside. Her unfinished designs felt like they were waiting for her to return.

Without her, the apartment felt hollow, like the walls were slowly closing in, smothering me.

And Milo… I couldn’t even look at him.

He’d sit there, watching me with that unblinking yellow eye, his presence a constant reminder of her. Now, he haunted me. He’d follow me from room to room, his limping gait eerily quiet. At night, I’d feel him climb onto the bed, curling up near my feet like he always did when she was alive. But his warmth felt like an accusation, his gaze heavy with something I couldn’t name.

Depression settled over me like a fog. I stopped caring about work, about the things that used to ground me. Emails went unanswered. Projects stalled. My coworkers whispered, their pity like a knife in my back.

I couldn’t shake the image of her name on my phone screen, the missed call that felt like a final plea I’d ignored.

Every day, I drifted further from the man I’d been, sinking into a darkness I couldn’t claw my way out of. And through it all, Milo remained, his presence a quiet, relentless shadow that I couldn’t escape.

It happened late one night, weeks after the funeral. Sleep had become a distant memory, replaced by restless nights staring at the ceiling or pacing the apartment. On this particular night, I found myself sitting at the kitchen table, Milo curled up nearby, his one good eye glinting in the dim light.

I opened my laptop, intending to distract myself with old emails, mindless scrolling or reading stories in r/nosleep . But as soon as the screen blinked to life, I noticed something strange. The notes app was open, and a new note sat at the top of the list.

I hadn’t written it.

My first thought was that it must have been left open accidentally, maybe from a file I’d forgotten about. But as I clicked on it, my heart froze.

The words were hurried, almost frantic, and they cut straight through me:

*“I’m here, love. It’s dark. So much rain. Please. Don’t forget me. Bring me back.”*

The air seemed to thicken around me. I stared at the screen, reading the message over and over, the words burning into my mind. It was impossible. She was gone. I’d buried her. This couldn’t be real.

But the voice in those words—it was hers. I could hear her in my mind as I read them, that familiar warmth tinged with fear. My hands shook as I sat back, trying to make sense of it.

I closed the laptop, my chest tight. It had to be my imagination, a product of sleepless nights and the weight of my guilt. But even as I told myself that, the words lingered, etched into my mind like a brand.

Later that night, I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling as the message replayed in my head. Milo jumped up, settling near my feet, his presence unusually heavy. I glanced at him, his yellow eye glinting in the darkness, and for a moment, it felt like he was watching me with something beyond the usual curiosity of a cat.

*“Bring me back.”*

I squeezed my eyes shut, willing the words to leave my mind. It was absurd, impossible. And yet…

A small part of me wanted to believe.

I woke the next morning to find the laptop still on the table, the note open exactly as I’d left it. The screen had dimmed, but the words were still there, waiting for me.

I should have deleted it. I should have dismissed it as nothing. But I couldn’t. Something about it felt too real, too vivid to ignore.

That night, as I drifted into another restless sleep, I thought about her words, about the rain and the darkness she described. And deep down, in the part of me that still ached with her absence, I felt a spark of something I hadn’t felt in weeks.

Hope.

The next day, the note was still on my mind. I tried to dismiss it as a figment of grief, some cruel trick my subconscious had conjured. But the more I tried to push it away, the more it clung to me, pulling me under like quicksand.

As the hours crept by in silence, Milo wandered into the room. He limped to the table and jumped onto it with surprising grace, his single yellow eye locking onto mine.

He stared at me—intense, unblinking, like he was trying to communicate something I couldn’t understand. The air in the room felt different, heavier, as though his gaze carried a weight I wasn’t ready to bear.

I thought of Lily, how she used to talk about him. “He’s special,” she’d say, her voice filled with quiet reverence. “He’s been through so much, and he’s still here. That kind of resilience… it connects you to something bigger.”

She’d called him her “bridge to the divine,” a creature who had suffered but survived, who could somehow touch something sacred because of it. At the time, I’d dismissed it as one of her whims, just another piece of her world that I couldn’t quite grasp. 

That night, as I lay in bed, Milo curled up beside me, a presence I couldn’t ignore. He purred softly, the sound vibrating against my leg, grounding me in the otherwise oppressive silence.

I closed my eyes, and when I opened them, the laptop screen glowed faintly in the dark. Another message had appeared, the words chillingly clear:

*“It’s dark here, Lewis. There are others. They hurt me. I don’t know how much longer I can hold on.”*

My breath hitched as I read the words, my heart pounding.

*“But sometimes there’s light,”* the message continued. *“Brief, warm… It’s because of him. He’s close to the Divine. When the light comes, I feel closer to you, closer to him. He’s my bridge.”*

Milo shifted beside me, his purring growing louder, almost resonant. It sent a shiver down my spine.

I stared at the screen, my mind racing. It was absurd, impossible. But the way she described him, the way he seemed to know…

Could it be true? Could Milo somehow be connecting her to me, bridging the gap between her world and mine?

I closed the laptop, my hands trembling, her words burned into my mind.

*“Bring me back.”*

Milo’s purring continued, steady and constant, filling the darkness around me. For the first time, I felt like I wasn’t entirely alone.

The following morning, I couldn’t shake the message. It lingered like a shadow, seeping into everything I did. She’d always told me Milo was special, her “martyr,” but now the thought had taken root in a way I couldn’t ignore. Every time he looked at me with that unblinking yellow eye, I felt it—that strange pull, like he understood far more than he should.

Milo appeared, perching silently on the edge of the table, his gaze fixed on me.

He didn’t move, didn’t blink. He just watched, his presence steady, grounding.

I turned to him, my chest tightening. His gaze was unrelenting, as if he knew what I was thinking, what I was feeling.

“She’s waiting,” I whispered, the words catching in my throat.

The messages kept coming. Each one was more vivid, more desperate, carving into me like a blade. Every night, I’d sit at the kitchen table, laptop open, waiting. And every night, as if by some unseen force, her words would appear, frantic and full of pain.

*“It’s dark here, Lewis. Always dark. The rain never stops—it soaks through me, cold, endless.”*

I could feel her despair in every keystroke. She described a place that sounded more like a nightmare than anything real—a decayed, abandoned city where the streets were slick with rain that never dried, where shadows lingered in every corner, watching her.

*“They hurt me, Lewis. These things… these broken souls. They whisper, they laugh, they tear at me. I can’t escape them.”*

I wanted to stop reading, to slam the laptop shut and pretend I hadn’t seen her words. But I couldn’t. They pulled me in, her voice echoing in my mind as I imagined her alone in that place, surrounded by horrors I couldn’t begin to understand.

And yet, amidst the darkness, she spoke of something else—something brighter.

*“Sometimes there’s a light. Just for a moment. Warm, gentle, like a touch. It reminds me of you. And him.”*

She didn’t have to explain who “him” was. Milo had been by my side every night, his unblinking gaze fixed on me as though he understood everything.

*“He’s close to the Divine, Lewis. His suffering has made him… more. When the light comes, I feel closer to you. To him. He’s my bridge. My only bridge.”*

But the messages didn’t stop there. They grew darker, more urgent.

*“I’m slipping, Lewis. The darkness is consuming me. I can feel myself fading. Why aren’t you helping me? Why aren’t you trying? You promised you’d always protect me.”*

Her pleas tore at me, each one more frantic than the last.

*“Bring me back. Please. I can’t hold on much longer.”*

Milo jumped onto the table, his purring low and steady. His single yellow eye met mine, and for a moment, it felt like he was trying to tell me something.

“She needs me,” I whispered, my voice cracking.

The cat didn’t move, didn’t blink. He just sat there, a silent, unrelenting presence, as if he understood everything I was saying.

I closed the laptop, the weight of her words crushing me.

*“Bring me back.”*

They echoed in my mind, louder and louder, until they were all I could hear.

The first night I searched, my fingers trembled as I typed into the search bar. I wasn’t sure what I was looking for—rituals, spells, anything that could explain the messages or give me a way to act. Most of what I found was nonsense: vague instructions from websites plastered with flashing ads, stories of ghosts that felt like campfire tales, and rambling forum posts from people who clearly didn’t have their lives together.

But then I stumbled onto a thread buried deep in a corner of the internet, far from where I’d started. The title was simple: *“Bringing Them Back: A Guide to Reconnecting Beyond the Veil.”*

I clicked, the screen flickering faintly as the page loaded. The post was long, written in an oddly clinical tone, as if the author were cataloging steps in a scientific experiment. There were instructions, diagrams, even specific items to gather. It wasn’t the usual rambling I’d come across—it was precise, methodical, like something I might have written if this were my field.

The ritual required a mix of items tied to the person you were trying to bring back: objects they’d loved, things that carried their essence. A favorite piece of jewelry. A strand of hair. The instructions described these as “anchors,” meant to tether their spirit to this world.

And then there was the final piece: *a vessel.*

The word stood out, chilling in its simplicity. The author was blunt: “The vessel must be pure, untainted by the world’s darkness. Youth is essential. Innocence is key.”

I sat back, my stomach twisting. The meaning was clear. I closed the laptop, my breath shaky as the idea burned itself into my mind. It was sick. Twisted. I couldn’t do that.

But the messages kept coming. That night, her words appeared again, more frantic than ever:

*“They’re hurting me, Lewis. I can’t fight them off much longer. Please. You have to do something.”*

Milo jumped onto the table, his gaze heavy. His presence always unnerved me, but now, it felt different—like he was pushing me, urging me forward.

I opened the laptop again, scrolling back to the thread. The diagrams were detailed, the instructions painfully specific. There was no room for interpretation. It was a blueprint, clear and cold.

The items were easy enough to gather. Her necklace sat on her nightstand, her ring in the bathroom, her hairbrush still tangled with strands of her hair. As I placed them on the table, they felt heavy, as if they carried pieces of her with them.

But the vessel…

I pushed the thought away, focusing on the steps I could complete. Each one felt like I was drawing closer to her, bridging the impossible gap between us. But the closer I got, the darker it felt, like the shadows around me were deepening.

Milo sat by the window, his silhouette outlined in the faint glow of the streetlight. His yellow eye caught the light, glinting like gold, and for the first time, I wondered if Lily was right. Was he more than just a cat?

I stared at the items arranged on the table, her words echoing in my mind:

*“Bring me back.”*

And as I sat there in the heavy silence, I realized I was willing to do whatever it took.

Her necklace, her ring, her hairbrush—they were already gathered, laid out carefully on the table. The sight of them made my chest ache. These were fragments of her, pieces that once felt so alive. Now, they felt like relics, remnants of a world I could never get back.

But it wasn’t enough.

*“The circle has to be perfect. Symbols matter, Lewis. You have to follow them exactly. Don’t get them wrong.”*

The candles came next. “Six candles,” she’d written. “White. Place them evenly around the circle.” The flames flickered as I lit them, casting long shadows that danced across the walls.

But the final instruction was the one that made my stomach churn: *the vessel.*

*“A vessel, young and pure, untouched by pain. It’s the only way, Lewis. Without it, the ritual will fail.”*

I’d tried to ignore that part, hoping there was some way around it. But the messages kept coming, each one hammering home the same point. The vessel was essential.

*“It has to be perfect. Please, Lewis. Don’t fail me.”*

I sat on the floor, staring at the circle, my mind spinning. Everything else was ready. Everything but that.

Milo jumped down from the couch, padding silently toward me. He stepped into the circle, his yellow eye glowing faintly in the candlelight. For a moment, I thought he might knock over one of the candles, but he stopped just short, sitting in the center of the chalk lines.

I watched him, my hands trembling.

“You know, don’t you?” I whispered.

His gaze didn’t waver.

The laptop pinged. Another message.

*“I’m slipping, Lewis. Please. Don’t let me go.”*

I closed my eyes, Milo’s purring filling the room.

*“Bring me back.”*

The circle was ready. The symbols were drawn. All that remained was the final step, the one I couldn’t bear to face.

Days blurred into nights as I prepared, the weight of Lily’s words pressing heavier with each passing moment. The vessel haunted me, a necessity I couldn’t bring myself to act on. Every time I stared at the ritual circle, perfectly arranged and waiting, my chest tightened with dread.

And then I saw her.

Sofia.

She lived next door, a bright, curious girl no older than nine. Her parents worked long hours, struggling to make ends meet, leaving her to play alone in the front yard most afternoons. She had a lightness about her, an innocence that stood out in sharp contrast to the darkness that had taken root inside me.

I watched her from the window, the way she giggled as she chased a butterfly, the way her messy ponytail bounced with each step. My stomach twisted. I tried to push the thought away, but it crept back, insidious and persistent.

She was perfect.

That evening, as I stepped out to throw the trash, Sofia spotted me. Her small face lit up as she waved, skipping over with a cardboard box in her arms.

“Hi, Mr. Lewis!” she chirped, her voice bright and clear.

I forced a smile, my throat dry. “Hi, Sofia. What’s that you’ve got there?”

She held up the box, her cheeks flushing with pride. “Toys for Milo! I saw him in the window. I thought he might like these.”

Inside the box were a few cat toys—chewed-up mice, a feather on a stick, and a jingly ball. They were old and worn, but her excitement was palpable.

“Thanks,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

She beamed, setting the box on the ground before skipping back to her yard.

I stood there for a moment, staring at the toys. A dull ache settled in my chest, a battle waging between the love I had for Lily and the deep sickness growing inside me.

The messages came that night, more desperate than ever.

*“The vessel, Lewis. It has to be now.”*

Her words cut through me like shards of glass. My hands trembled as I closed the laptop, Milo’s soft purring the only sound in the room.

Sofia’s face lingered in my mind. Her kindness. Her innocence. She was everything Lily had described, everything the ritual demanded.

I sat on the floor, staring at the chalk circle as the candles flickered. My chest felt tight, my breathing shallow.

*“Bring me back.”*

I knew what I had to do.

That night, I cleaned the living room with meticulous care, scrubbing away every trace of normalcy. The chalk circle was still there, faint but intact, and I went over each line, making sure it was perfect.

The items Lily had loved were already in place—her necklace, her ring, her hairbrush. I’d laid them out in a careful circle, each one aligned with the symbols drawn in chalk. They felt sacred, like fragments of her soul tethered to this world.

But they weren’t enough.

I stared at the center of the circle, the empty space that was waiting, demanding. The vessel.

Sofia had been in my thoughts all day, her laughter echoing in my mind like a cruel taunt. I could still see her smile as she handed me the box of cat toys, her innocence so pure it hurt to think about.

I paced the room, my heart pounding in my chest. The apartment felt stifling, the air too thick to breathe. My logical mind screamed at me to stop, to walk away, to let Lily go. But her words, her desperate pleas, drowned out every rational thought.

*“I need you, Lewis. Please. Don’t let me fade.”*

I glanced at the laptop, the screen dark but her messages burned into my memory.

*“Bring me back.”*

I took a deep breath, my hands trembling as I stepped out into the night. Sofia was playing in her yard again, her tiny figure barely illuminated by the dim glow of the streetlights. She was crouched over a patch of dirt, carefully shaping it into something that resembled a castle.

My stomach twisted as I called out to her. “Sofia!”

She looked up, her face brightening as she waved.

“Hi, Mr. Lewis!”

“Hey,” I said, forcing a smile. “I was wondering… do you want to come see Milo? He’s been playing with the toys you brought him all day.”

Her eyes lit up. “Really?”

“Yeah,” I lied, my voice barely steady. “I think he misses you.”

She jumped to her feet, brushing dirt off her hands. “Okay!”

She took my hand without hesitation, her small fingers warm against mine. Each step back to the apartment felt heavier than the last, my heart pounding in my ears.

Inside, Milo was waiting, his single eye glowing faintly in the candlelight. Sofia let go of my hand and rushed to him, kneeling beside him with a giggle.

“Milo! Look, it’s me!” she said, holding up one of the toys she’d brought earlier.

He didn’t move, his gaze fixed on me instead.

“Sofia,” I said softly, my throat tight. “Do you want to play a game?”

She turned to me, her smile wide. “I love games!”

“Good,” I whispered, my hands trembling. “But first, I need you to close your eyes and be very quiet. It’s a surprise.”

She giggled, covering her eyes with her hands.

“No peeking,” she teased.

I stepped behind her, my breath catching as I pulled the shoelace from my pocket. My fingers felt numb as I looped it around her neck, my mind screaming at me to stop.

But Lily’s voice cut through the chaos, sharp and desperate.

*“Bring me back.”*

With a choked sob, I pulled the ends tight.

The moment I pulled the shoelace tight, her laughter turned into confusion, then panic. She gasped, her small hands clawing at the cord around her neck as I choked out the words, “I’m sorry.”

Her muffled cries tore through me, each sound a dagger to my chest. Her struggles grew weaker as the seconds dragged on, her tiny body finally slumping forward. When it was over, the silence was deafening.

I staggered back, my hands trembling as I stared at her lifeless form. Her head tilted awkwardly, her soft curls brushing the chalk lines of the circle. The shoelace hung loose, mocking me with its simplicity, a stark contrast to the unthinkable horror I’d just committed.

My breath came in shallow gasps as I stumbled to the corner of the room, bile rising in my throat. I vomited, the acidic taste burning my mouth, but the nausea wouldn’t leave me. I couldn’t stop shaking.

Milo remained near the circle, his single yellow eye fixed on Sofia’s body. 

I sank to the floor, cradling my head in my hands. My mind screamed at me to undo it, to go back, to make it so this had never happened. But it was too late.

*“Bring me back.”*

I forced myself to my feet, my legs weak and unsteady. The circle, the symbols, the candles—they were waiting, ready to fulfill their purpose. This had to work. It *had* to.

With trembling hands, I placed Sofia’s small body in the center of the circle. Her arms flopped awkwardly, her lifeless face turned toward me. I couldn’t look at her for long without feeling the bile rise again.

I knelt just outside the circle, the instructions from the ritual thread burned into my mind. My voice was shaky as I began to speak, reciting the ancient words written in the diagrams. The language was unfamiliar, guttural and harsh, but I forced each syllable out, my throat tightening with every word.

The room grew colder, the air heavy and thick. The flames of the candles stretched unnaturally tall, flickering wildly as though caught in a storm. Milo moved closer, sitting just outside the circle, his gaze unblinking. His purring grew louder, resonating through the apartment like a low, vibrating hum.

The symbols I’d drawn began to glow faintly, their edges shimmering with an otherworldly light. A strange, low sound filled the room, like a distant wind rushing through a hollow cavern.

Tears streamed down my face as I continued the incantation, my voice growing stronger. The glow from the circle intensified, bathing the room in an unnatural light. Sofia’s body seemed to shift slightly, her chest rising as though she were drawing a shallow breath.

For a brief, fleeting moment, I felt her. Lily. Her presence filled the room, warm and familiar, like the sun breaking through clouds after a storm.

But just as quickly as it came, the warmth was replaced by a chilling cold that seeped into my bones.

Milo hissed, his fur bristling as he backed away from the circle.

And then Sofia’s body convulsed.

Sofia’s body jerked violently, her limbs twisting in unnatural ways. The glow of the circle pulsed brighter, casting the room in an eerie, sickly light. My breath caught as I watched, frozen in place.

“Lily?” I whispered, my voice breaking.

The convulsions stopped abruptly, leaving Sofia’s body limp and lifeless once more. The silence that followed was suffocating.

“Lily, are you here?”

Nothing.

The candles burned low, their wax pooling onto the floor. The chalk lines of the circle were faint now, smudged from Sofia’s convulsions.

I stayed there for hours, staring at the stillness in front of me. My mind refused to process what I was seeing. This was supposed to work. She was supposed to come back.

As the hours dragged on, the room began to change. The faint smell of decay seeped into the air, growing stronger with each passing minute.

The stench of death grew unbearable, clinging to my clothes, to my skin. I grabbed air fresheners from under the sink, spraying them in a futile attempt to cover the smell. It didn’t work.

I turned to Milo, who sat near the edge of the room, his yellow eye glinting in the dim light. He watched me with a strange intensity, his tail flicking slowly back and forth.

“You felt her, didn’t you?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Milo didn’t move.

The next morning, the decay was undeniable. Sofia’s body had begun to change—her skin pale and waxy, her lips a faint shade of blue. Her small frame seemed impossibly fragile, a stark contrast to the horror of what I’d done.

I knelt by the circle, tears streaming down my face. “Lily… I did this for you. Please, just… give me a sign. Anything.”

The only response was silence.

I couldn’t leave her like this. The smell would betray me, the sight of her twisted form would haunt me. I knew what I had to do, but the thought of it made me gag.

I turned to Milo, my voice shaking. “She’s not coming back, is she?”

His gaze bore into me, heavy and unreadable.

And still, I waited.

For a sign.

For anything.

The smell had become unbearable. It clung to everything—the walls, the furniture, my skin. No amount of air freshener could mask it. I’d gone through every can under the sink, spraying every corner of the apartment until the chemical scent mixed with the rot, creating a stench even more nauseating. But it wasn’t enough.

I found myself lingering in other rooms, avoiding the living room entirely. But the smell seeped into everything, an inescapable reminder of what I’d done.

After days of pacing, I opened the windows, hoping the night air would help. It didn’t. The rot was thick, oppressive. I grabbed another can of air freshener and sprayed until the nozzle gave out, my fingers sticky from the residue.

That was when I opened the cupboard and saw the stack of old Tupperware containers Lily used to store leftovers.

It was the only way.

I gathered what I needed: gloves, garbage bags, a knife, and the Tupperware containers.

I approached the living room slowly, the knife heavy in my hand. Sofia’s small body lay in the center of the circle, her skin pale and waxy, her curls matted against her forehead. I knelt beside her, my breath shaky.

“I’m so sorry,” I whispered.

The first cut was the hardest. The knife sliced through her arm with sickening ease, the sound of flesh and bone splitting echoing in the silent apartment. My hands trembled as I worked, tears blurring my vision.

Each piece was carefully placed into a Tupperware container. Little pieces er arms, her legs, her head—each sealed tightly, the lids snapping shut with a finality that made me gag. I pressed the containers down, ensuring they were locked airtight.

I sprayed the air freshener again, the sharp floral scent burning my nose, but it couldn’t drown out the stench. I grabbed another can and sprayed until my hand cramped.

The containers sat on the kitchen counter, their lids a cheerful blue and green, mocking me.

I packed the containers into a duffel bag, their hard edges pressing against the fabric. The weight of them felt impossible, like I was carrying the burden of what I’d done.

I drove far out of town, the air freshener cans still rolling around in the passenger seat beside me. The road was empty, the darkness stretching endlessly. When I reached the woods, I grabbed a shovel from the trunk and dragged the duffel bag into the trees.

Each Tupperware container was placed into the grave, one by one. The sight of them, stacked neatly in the dirt, made my stomach turn. I covered them with soil, packing it down until there was no trace of what lay beneath.

Back in the apartment, the smell lingered, faint but still there. I grabbed another can of air freshener and sprayed the entire living room, choking on the chemical fumes.

Milo jumped onto the couch beside me, his purring steady. I reached out and rested my hand on his back, my fingers trembling.

“I did it for her,” I whispered into the silence.

But the silence didn’t answer.

I spent hours staring at the laptop, waiting for another message, another word from Lily. But nothing came. The screen stayed dark, its silence louder than anything I could bear.

Late one night, as I sat in the flickering glow of the kitchen light, the laptop pinged. My heart leapt, my breath catching as I opened it.

*“Did you enjoy our little game?”*

I froze, my blood running cold. My hands hovered over the keyboard, trembling. The words continued to appear, each one more mocking than the last:

*“Did you really think you could bring her back?”“Did you think you were a hero?”*

My mind raced, the weight of their words crushing me.

*“She’s gone, you twisted fuck. She’s been gone all along. And now, so is that poor girl.”*

I slammed the laptop shut. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. But deep down, I knew the truth.

Someone had been watching. Someone had seen me fall apart, had fed me the messages I so desperately wanted to believe. They’d used Lily’s voice, her pain, her memory to twist me into something I didn’t recognize.

Milo padded into the bathroom, his presence heavy as he sat in the doorway, watching. I turned to him, my voice barely above a whisper.

“It wasn’t her, was it?”

His gaze didn’t waver.

The faint smell of rot lingered beneath the artificial floral scent, clawing at my throat.

The laptop pinged again from the kitchen. The sound was sharp, cutting through the thick silence. I didn’t need to look to know what it said.

I was a murderer. 

And Lily was never coming back.

I couldn’t stay in the living room. The air freshener, though still overpowering, no longer masked the faint scent of decay that seemed to cling to the walls. I fled to the bedroom, slamming the door behind me, but even there, the weight of what I’d done followed.

Lily’s unfinished zodiac map sat propped against the wall, her careful brushstrokes frozen in time. The stars she had meticulously painted seemed to mock me, their delicate lines a reminder of who she was—and who I wasn’t.

But now, it felt like the last piece of her I had.

“You don’t believe because you don’t want to,” she’d said once, smiling softly. “But that doesn’t make it any less real.”

I stared at the map, my chest tightening. The stars seemed to shift, their patterns twisting and warping into shapes I didn’t recognize.

Lily’s laughter haunted me, distant and fragmented, blending with the hacker’s cruel words that had burned into my mind.

*“She’s gone.”“You’re a monster.”“This was never real.”*

I sat at the kitchen table, Milo perched beside me. His single yellow eye was fixed on the laptop, its dark screen reflecting the flickering candlelight. He didn’t blink, didn’t move, his presence a steady weight that filled the silence.

Milo purred softly, his voice a low vibration that hummed through the apartment. It was the only sound in the oppressive quiet, a reminder that he was still there, watching, judging.

The gun was cold in my hand. I’d bought it weeks ago, during the first desperate days after Lily’s death, but I hadn’t had the courage to use it. Now, its weight felt right.

I stood in the center of the circle, staring at the zodiac map propped against the wall. The constellations seemed to shift, the stars writhing like living things, their lines bleeding into one another.

Milo padded closer, his tail flicking as he sat just outside the circle. His purring grew louder, resonating in the stillness.

“I tried,” I whispered, my voice shaking. “I tried to bring you back, Lily. I gave everything.”

Tears blurred my vision as I raised the gun, pressing the barrel against my temple.

The zodiac would be complete. Blood-red would fill the final constellation, a symbol of everything I’d lost.

Milo purred louder, his yellow eye glinting in the dim light.
