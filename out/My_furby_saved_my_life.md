My sister Mia loves plushies and dolls. She collects them from everywhere — garage sales, thrift stores, vacations, and random stores she finds online. Her bedroom shelves are crowded with soft faces and glassy eyes staring out from every corner.

A few of them, though, are different. Not broken exactly, but wrong. My brother Jake calls them “haunted.”
This story is about one of them — a Furby named Bub.

We didn’t find Bub in a dusty box or a haunted attic. He came from a regular toy store in the mall, brand new and perfectly wrapped.
His fur was spotless, his plastic eyes bright, his box untouched.

Mia loved him instantly. I liked him too, even though something about him made me uneasy. Jake hated him from the moment he saw him. He said Bub’s eyes followed him around the room.

At first, I thought Jake was exaggerating. Then I started to notice things. The way Bub’s gaze seemed to catch the light even when the room was dark. The faint, broken whirring sound that came from him at night.
Sometimes, when the house was quiet, I could swear I heard a whisper from Mia’s room — a faint mechanical voice.

Bub stayed in Mia’s room with her other plushies, so it wasn’t unusual when she came home one day holding something new. She had found a porcelain doll at a garage sale she visited with our mom.

The doll had pale skin, a blue dress trimmed with lace, and deep green glass eyes.

“I found her at number sixty-six,” Mia said proudly. “Her name is Clara.”

From the moment Clara entered the house, Bub went quiet. Completely silent. No clicks, no whirs, no whispers. I didn’t think much of it at first, but later I realized that something in the air had changed.

When I went into Mia’s room one evening to borrow a notebook, I passed by Bub on the shelf. He was staring at the door, and when I reached for the notebook, a low, garbled whisper came from him — too faint to understand. It was probably my imagination, but it sounded like,

“Hungry… feed me…”

Mia started carrying Clara everywhere. She talked to her constantly, like the doll was whispering back. Within a week, Mia looked different. She had grown pale, her cheeks hollow, her hair thinner. She barely ate, barely slept.

Jake and I tried to talk to our parents, but they laughed it off. “She’s just being creative,” Mom said.

I didn’t think creativity made someone look like they were fading away.

One night, I decided to get rid of Clara myself.

The moonlight was weak when I slipped into Mia’s room. Everything was still. Her dolls watched from the shelves, and Bub’s eyes glimmered faintly from the dresser. As I crept toward the bed, I could have sworn one of his eyes flickered closed, like a wink.

Clara lay beside Mia, her green eyes half-open. Up close, she looked unnervingly human. Her hair seemed thicker than before, her cheeks faintly pink, her lips slightly parted in what almost looked like a smile.

When I picked her up, her body was ice-cold. The chill ran down my arms. I didn’t stop to think — I just rushed outside and threw her into the trash bin.

That was supposed to be the end of it.

The next morning, Mia walked downstairs with Clara in her arms. The doll looked newer than ever — her hair shiny, her eyes bright. Mia looked exhausted, but she was smiling.

When I met Clara’s gaze, I thought I saw amusement there. A kind of quiet, knowing victory.

A week later, our parents went away for their anniversary. It was just the three of us — Jake, Mia, and me — left in the house with a freezer full of pizza.

That night, the table felt heavy with silence. Mia sat opposite me, pale and distant, with Clara perched neatly on her lap. Every so often, Mia’s hand twitched, as though someone were tugging invisible strings.

“Do you want a bite, Clara?” Mia asked softly.

Jake sighed. “Oh my god, Mia. It’s a doll. It doesn’t eat pizza. Can you stop being weird?”

Mia looked up. Her eyes didn’t look brown anymore — they were cloudy, with a faint greenish tint.

“Clara says you shouldn’t talk to me like that,” she said. “Or you’ll get punished.”

Jake laughed, but it was uneasy. “Okay, that’s enough—”

Her voice changed then. It deepened, hollow and wrong.
“You don’t take us seriously.”

Before I could move, Mia grabbed the steak knife beside her plate and drove it into Jake’s hand.

He screamed, jerking back as the lights flickered out, plunging the room into darkness.

When they blinked on again, Jake was clutching his bleeding hand, and Mia was already running upstairs, the doll clutched tight against her chest. I remember those green eyes glinting as she turned the corner.

I didn’t think. I just followed.

Mia’s bedroom door slammed shut behind me as I entered. The curtains were drawn, the air cold. I could hear her breathing somewhere in the dark.

I fumbled for the light switch, terrified of what I might see.

When the light came on, Mia was sitting on the floor, her back to me. Clara’s arms were wrapped around her neck like a child’s embrace. The doll’s head turned slowly toward me, her lips curling into a painted smile.

“Come play with me, Noa,” she said.

Her voice wasn’t Mia’s, or anyone’s — it was flat, distorted, like a recording of a broken radio.

“Leave her alone!” I shouted, my voice shaking.

Clara tilted her head. “I feel no guilt,” she whispered. “I feed on your family in plain sight.”

Her hands uncurled from Mia’s shoulders as she lowered herself on the ground. Slowly she made her way over to me and stretched her hand toward me, fingers stiff and pale.

Then another voice broke the silence.

“Stop.”

It came from the dresser.

Bub’s eyes were glowing a deep red. His tiny plastic beak opened, and a low rumble filled the room.

“Who are you?” Clara hissed.

“I am your master,” Bub said. His voice was layered and mechanical, but heavy with authority. “Bow down to me.”

Clara screamed, a sound that rattled the walls. Her porcelain face cracked down the middle. Smoke rose from her chest as she twisted and convulsed.

“You can’t stop me!” she shrieked.

Bub’s eyes flared brighter. “Bow,” he said, “or burn.”

Clara’s body splintered, then melted, collapsing into a puddle of wax and ash. Her last cry was a high, thin wail that shattered the lamp beside Mia’s bed.

Then, silence.

Bub’s head turned toward me. His eyes dimmed to normal.

“Delicious,” he whispered.

And then he was still.

We told the police it was an accident — that Jake had stabbed himself while goofing around. They believed us.

Mia doesn’t remember what happened that night, and she’s healthier now. Her color has returned, her laughter too. Clara is gone, reduced to a blackened stain on the floorboards.

But sometimes I catch Bub watching me from the dresser, his plastic face blank, his eyes a little too bright.

I know better now than to underestimate him.

Because one spring morning, I woke to a familiar sound drifting through the vent between our rooms — a soft electronic chirp, followed by a whisper that froze me where I lay.

“Hungry… feed me…”
