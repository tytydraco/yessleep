We’re not seeing things. It was there. It kept coming back again and again. We know what we saw. Everyone in this house, maybe even everyone in the whole neighborhood, may be in serious danger. I know they didn’t see it, but that doesn’t mean that it wasn’t there!

I’m sorry. I’m still really freaked out and scared. I’ll back up and explain some things.

My name is Luna. I have a fraternal twin sister named Dana. We are currently in Florida with our mother, Julia. Mom’s sister, Aunt Kathy, had some minor damage to her house from Hurricane Ian. The three of us have been wanting to come see her, but Aunt Kathy asked us to wait a few months until her house was repaired. Mom reluctantly agreed. Last week Aunt Kathy called and said we were welcome to come down to see her any time we wanted to. Dana and I were thrilled since we hadn’t seen Aunt Kathy in several years. We left the day after we got the call.

When we got to Aunt Kathy’s house, we were surprised to find that she had adopted a dog. She has always preferred cats just like Mom has, but Aunt Kathy told us that the dog belonged to a friend of hers who had lost her house in the hurricane and could no longer keep her dog. Aunt Kathy agreed to adopt her.

Dana and I have always loved animals and the dog immediately loved us. We were delighted to find out that her name was Deirdre. Our family has strong Irish ancestry and Dana and I have recently started to learn the Irish language.

Deirdre is a massive, massive dog. She’s about the size of a Newfoundland. Aunt Kathy has no idea what kind of dog she is. All she knows is that she is a Labrador Retriever mix and that she was born in Ireland. Deirdre basically looks like a giant black lab. Dana and I are five feet three inches tall, but if Deirdre is standing on her hind legs, she is as tall as we are, possibly even taller. She is definitely an intimidating dog, but most of the time she is essentially a giant playful teddy bear.

Dana and I were in the den later that night watching TV. It was around 2 am and neither of us could sleep. Mom, Aunt Kathy, and Deirdre were all asleep. While Dana was looking for something cool to watch, I was in the kitchen making us a late night snack.

“Uh, Luna?”

“Yeah, Dana?”

“When Mom and Aunt Kathy were talking about cars earlier, Aunt Kathy said that no one in the neighborhood has a white sports car, right?”

I continued to make our peanut butter and jelly sandwiches while I talked to my sister. “Yeah, she said that. You know how much Aunt Kathy and Mom love cars because of Grandpa. I’m not at all surprised that Aunt Kathy knows every car in the neighborhood.”

“There’s also only one set of gates at the front of the neighborhood and they’re always locked, right?”

“Yep, that’s right. Aunt Kathy explained all of this earlier even though we’ve been here before. That’s why she gave you, me, and Mom the current code to the gate. It’s the only way into the neighborhood and the gate can’t be opened unless you know the code or the gate guard lets you in.” Aunt Kathy lives in a very nice neighborhood that has had several robbery attempts occur, so the neighborhood increased the security after the hurricane damage was repaired.

“The gate guards only work from 7 in the morning to 7 at night, right?”

I sighed as I started making the last sandwich. “Yes, that’s right. Were you not listening to Aunt Kathy when she told us all of this?”

“No, I was.”

“Then why are you asking me all of these questions when you already know the answers?”

“Because a white sports car keeps driving back and forth in front of the house.”

My knife froze in midair. That’s not right. I put the knife down and walked back into the den to see my sister staring out the window with a nervous look on her face. I sat next to her and looked out the window.

She was right. There was a white sports car driving back and forth in front of our aunt’s house. How the heck did it get into the neighborhood?! I was starting to get scared.

“Luna, is it just me or is that car…glowing?”

I looked closer and there was indeed a very faint glow coming off the car. It was too strong to be moonlight. We tried to see the driver, but the windows were too dark. There was nothing but pitch blackness inside the car. Okay, I was officially freaked out.

“Dana, go wake up Mom and Aunt Kathy. Something is really wrong here.”

While Dana went to go wake them up, I suddenly heard a low growl next to me. I jumped and looked to my left. Deirdre was standing next to me. She was staring out the window at the car and growling with her hackles raised. How did she get in here? The den floor is hardwood and I didn’t hear her at all.

When Mom and Aunt Kathy came into the den, the car suddenly vanished.

Dana and I tried to explain what we saw, but Aunt Kathy said that was impossible and we must have been seeing things. She said Deirdre was probably growling at some kind of animal that was around the house. Mom told us that we needed to go to sleep and stop reading so much r/nosleep before bed. After exchanging a glance, we both obeyed and went back to our room.

As soon as we closed the door to our room, we looked at each other and instantly knew that we both felt it.

Dana and I are not identical twins, but we might as well be. We can communicate through nothing but facial expressions and looks. We’ve also always had this sort of extra sense. We can feel when something is wrong or when something bad is going to happen. 

We’ve never been wrong. That car will be coming back and we can tell that it will be a lot worse than it was tonight.
