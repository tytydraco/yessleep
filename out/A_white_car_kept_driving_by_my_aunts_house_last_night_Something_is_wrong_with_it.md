We’re not seeing things. It was there. It kept coming back again and again. We know what we saw. Everyone in this house, maybe even everyone in the whole neighborhood, may be in serious danger. I know they didn’t see it, but that doesn’t mean that it wasn’t there!

I’m sorry. I’m still really freaked out and scared. I’ll back up and explain some things.

My name is Luna. I have a fraternal twin sister named Dana. We are currently in Florida with our mother, Julia. Mom’s sister, Aunt Kathy, had some minor damage to her house from Hurricane Ian. The three of us have been wanting to come see her, but Aunt Kathy asked us to wait a few months until her house was repaired. Mom reluctantly agreed. Last week Aunt Kathy called and said we were welcome to come down to see her any time we wanted to. Dana and I were thrilled since we hadn’t seen Aunt Kathy in several years. We left the day after we got the call.

When we got to Aunt Kathy’s house, we were surprised to find that she had adopted a dog. She has always preferred cats just like Mom has, but Aunt Kathy told us that the dog belonged to a friend of hers who had lost her house in the hurricane and could no longer keep her dog. Aunt Kathy agreed to adopt her.

Dana and I have always loved animals and the dog immediately loved us. We were delighted to find out that her name was Deirdre. Our family has strong Irish ancestry and Dana and I have recently started to learn the Irish language.

Deirdre is a massive, massive dog. She’s about the size of a Newfoundland. Aunt Kathy has no idea what kind of dog she is. All she knows is that she is a Labrador Retriever mix and that she was born in Ireland. Deirdre basically looks like a giant black lab. Dana and I are five feet three inches tall, but if Deirdre is standing on her hind legs, she is as tall as we are, possibly even taller. She is definitely an intimidating dog, but most of the time she is essentially a giant playful teddy bear.

Dana and I were in the den later that night watching TV. It was around 2 am and neither of us could sleep. Mom, Aunt Kathy, and Deirdre were all asleep. While Dana was looking for something cool to watch, I was in the kitchen making us a late night snack.

“Uh, Luna?”

“Yeah, Dana?”

“When Mom and Aunt Kathy were talking about cars earlier, Aunt Kathy said that no one in the neighborhood has a white sports car, right?”

I continued to make our peanut butter and jelly sandwiches while I talked to my sister. “Yeah, she said that. You know how much Aunt Kathy and Mom love cars because of Grandpa. I’m not at all surprised that Aunt Kathy knows every car in the neighborhood.”

“There’s also only one set of gates at the front of the neighborhood and they’re always locked, right?”

“Yep, that’s right. Aunt Kathy explained all of this earlier even though we’ve been here before. That’s why she gave you, me, and Mom the current code to the gate. It’s the only way into the neighborhood and the gate can’t be opened unless you know the code or the gate guard lets you in.” Aunt Kathy lives in a very nice neighborhood that has had several robbery attempts occur, so the neighborhood increased the security after the hurricane damage was repaired.

“The gate guards only work from 7 in the morning to 7 at night, right?”

I sighed as I started making the last sandwich. “Yes, that’s right. Were you not listening to Aunt Kathy when she told us all of this?”

“No, I was.”

“Then why are you asking me all of these questions when you already know the answers?”

“Because a white sports car keeps driving back and forth in front of the house.”

My knife froze in midair. That’s not right. I put the knife down and walked back into the den to see my sister staring out the window with a nervous look on her face. I sat next to her and looked out the window.

She was right. There was a white sports car driving back and forth in front of our aunt’s house. How the heck did it get into the neighborhood?! I was starting to get scared.

“Luna, is it just me or is that car…glowing?”

I looked closer and there was indeed a very faint glow coming off the car. It was too strong to be moonlight. We tried to see the driver, but the windows were too dark. There was nothing but pitch blackness inside the car. Okay, I was officially freaked out.

“Dana, go wake up Mom and Aunt Kathy. Something is really wrong here.”

While Dana went to go wake them up, I suddenly heard a low growl next to me. I jumped and looked to my left. Deirdre was standing next to me. She was staring out the window at the car and growling with her hackles raised. How did she get in here? The den floor is hardwood and I didn’t hear her at all.

When Mom and Aunt Kathy came into the den, the car suddenly vanished.

Dana and I tried to explain what we saw, but Aunt Kathy said that was impossible and we must have been seeing things. She said Deirdre was probably growling at some kind of animal that was around the house. Mom told us that we needed to go to sleep and stop reading so much r/nosleep before bed. After exchanging a glance, we both obeyed and went back to our room. Maybe Mom was right and we were just seeing things. We both went to sleep.

Less than an hour later Dana and I suddenly jerked awake at the same time.

“Luna? D-do you f-feel t-that?”

I slowly nodded. Dana and I were not identical twins, but we might as well have been since we could communicate with each other and guess each other’s thoughts with almost no effort.

“You mean that feeling like sharp icicles being run across our skin?”

“Yeah, that one. Do you remember the last time we felt this, Luna?”

I frowned and concentrated. Dana and I have always felt strange sensations when something is wrong or something bad is about to happen. We’ve gotten used to the different feelings of anticipation, but this icicle feeling was unfamiliar. The only other time I’ve felt something like this was when someone tried to break into our house back home three years ago.

Oh. Oh no.

Dana’s eyes widened in realization as she remembered as well. We had seen the person who broke into our house earlier that day walking around our neighborhood repeatedly. We told Mom and she said not to worry about it and that he was probably just lost. 

“Dana, this is the same feeling we got before the guy broke into our house…”

“So that means-!”

We both froze as we heard a noise from the garage. It was the sound of the garage door opening. Everyone who has the ability to open that garage door is asleep.

“Dana, wake up Mom and Aunt Kathy. Tell them that someone is trying to break into the house through the garage and have them call 911.”

“What are you going to do, Luna?” 

“I’m going to find Deirdre and wake her up. If whoever is in the garage breaks in, hopefully she’ll spook him enough that he gives us all enough time to get somewhere safe until the police get here.”

While Dana went to do that, I found Deirdre asleep in the living room. “Deirdre. Deirdre, wake up. Deirdre!”

She opened her eyes, huffed at me, and then went back to sleep.

I was starting to panic. What if the robber got in before the police got here? He could kill us. We needed Deirdre’s help and we needed it now.

Wait. Deirdre was born in Ireland. There's a chance she might know Irish. It was worth a try. I thought hard trying to think of the word that would most likely make her understand that we needed her help. When I thought of it, I took a deep breath and hoped that I pronounced this correctly.

“Deirdre, contúirt!”

Deirdre immediately leapt to her feet growling and looking around. I was shocked that that had actually worked. The only Irish word I could think of was the word for danger, which was clearly a word she knew. Without any warning she suddenly ran toward the hallway that contained the door connecting the house to the garage. I quickly followed her and found her planted in front of the door growling with her hackles raised.

I jumped as something large and heavy crashed against the door like it was trying to break it down. Deirdre lunged towards the door and started barking. This was the first time I had heard her bark and it was absolutely terrifying. She sounded like a roaring bear or lion.

As soon as Deirdre started barking, I heard an inhuman shriek on the other side of the door that was so piercing I had to put my hands over my ears. The closest description I can give is a combination of an eagle cry, nails being dragged across a chalkboard, and a person being burned alive. A few seconds after this horrible sound I heard police sirens. Whatever was trying to break in heard them as well because I heard footsteps running out of the garage and the sound of a car skidding before racing down the street.

We all spent several hours talking to the police after that. The officers told us that when they pulled up to the house, they saw a white sports car tearing out of our driveway. They gave chase, but they could not find the car even though they searched the entire neighborhood. It was like it had completely vanished in seconds.

The door connecting the garage to the house now had several fresh dents and scratches that were absolutely not there before the break in attempt.

We were of course extremely shaken up, so the police stationed an officer across the street from the house for the rest of the night. After they left, we all tried to go back to bed, but Dana and I could not sleep. We were both thinking the exact same thing.

This wasn’t over. Whatever that creature is will be coming back.
