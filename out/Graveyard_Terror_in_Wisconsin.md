Hey all, I just wanted to start this off by saying, if you're in small town called Edgerton Wisconsin and you go out in the woods, graveyard or any part that isn't downtown at night be wary. I grew up in this town and some of the most terrifying experiences in my life happened here. I want to talk to you about one specifically. I will call this There is Something Lurking in the Graveyard.

This was when I was in 11th grade. I had just met my now best-friend let's call him Mark. We were both talking about supernatural sightings in the area that day. We recently had unexplained news about large footprints in the area the police had chalked it up to a wolf.

A little backstory on the town. It's a very old tobacco down originally founded in 1853 and quickly rose to the tobacco center of Wisconsin. Edgerton is a town of less than 6,000 people. It's mostly full of rednecks that are looking to get drunk after work. So, why is this such a hotspot for supernatural activity? 

The Blackhawk Indian tribe used to live on the lands on where they're founded. Edgerton city council had dug up burial grounds to make the graveyard. Not only is this a very terrible idea, but they missed some of the most specific things about a graveyard. 

There is a tomb of the unknown soldier which nobody knows the history of or where it came from.

Anyway, on to the story: 

On a Friday night my buddy decided that he was going to stay at my house and play video games. We spent most of the night playing Halo 3 and just demolishing people online. We had a great time. Now, this was before we started drinking and smoking so this was a completely sober evening for us. At about midnight we started talking about ghosts, and individual experiences and had the random idea to go to the graveyard. At this point, we had no idea what we were about to stumble upon.

Now, we decided to climb out the window down on to the driveway where we continued to walk down the cul-de-sac that was Dakota Dr. I remember feeling watched from the get-go. I don't necessarily know how else to explain it. We walked up a hill to where a former friend of mine was and I just noticed something even stranger. The darkness of the night was encroaching around us. I had kept this to myself as I thought I was just experiencing things differently. The number one thing I noticed that this night was very different was the light around the lamp posts was barely shining. It made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck.

We walked along the sidewalk both silent. I don't know if it was because we were both experiencing the same thing but something just felt like it was leading us along. The feeling of being watched only got stronger the closer we got to the graveyard. My entire instinct was telling me to turn around and go home, but I couldn't.

The pathway to the graveyard was on a sidewalk along the highway. It was a heavily forested area with a ton of trees. I just noticed it kept on getting darker and darker the closer I got to the graveyard. I remember at one point trying to speak to my buddy and nothing came out. I just kept on marching on.

We had been walking about twenty minutes at this point and nearing the entrance of the gate. I held my hand up and could barely see it. The dark felt unnatural. I remember hearing a stick break up ahead and I put my hand on Marks shoulder making him stop. He shook out of whatever trance we were in and we both looked at each other confused. We didn't remember getting here right away.  

I shook my head and looked at Mark, I motioned that we should head back to the house trying to keep quiet. I noticed even at this moment I wasn't able to speak. At this point in time, we were both interrupted by a "Help" voice that came from the graveyard itself.  As far as I could tell this was coming from the tomb of the unknown soldier. Mark almost started to run into the graveyard, and I stopped him by grasping his shoulder. At this point I was fog-headed and was barely keeping myself from running in as well. 

I could feel the strands of hair along my neck going up again. We were both frozen. We tried to run but couldn't. Time seemed to pass super slowly at this point, I'm not sure if it was the adrenaline or if it was something else entirely. This was the same feeling I felt when the trance had originally begun. I shook myself out of it and quickly shook my buddy so he didn't step back into the grasps of whatever was hunting us. 

"Help me" We heard again louder but on the opposite side of the road like it was trying to get us to run away from the lights no matter how dim they looked to us. I motioned to Marc to head back to the gas station so we could be where people were. 

Every step felt heavy, we couldn't run, we could barely walk more than a few steps per 30 seconds. It was like something was trying to keep us there. As we started to get closer to the end of the steel fence of the graveyard, we saw it. Something was standing in the back, it looked like it was coming out of the grave. It stood about twelve foot tall was super dark and looked like a shadow with yellow eyes. It looked like something was coming out of its head. 

It started to walk toward the footsteps that we were making, and I realized its sense of hearing was what it relied on. I put my mouth on Mark so he wouldn't scream and motioned to quietly walk that way. The less noise we made the easier it was to walk. We walked quietly but quickly passed the graveyard and didn't look back. I tried to pay as little attention to it as possible.

We eventually made it to the gas station and since we were underage and breaking curfew decided against going in and tried to make it home. The darkness seemed to return back to normal as we made it back to our cozy cul-de-sac and then back to my house. We climbed back into the window and was very uncertain that what happened was even real. We didn't say a word and just decided to go to sleep as we were both mentally drained.

That night didn't end there. This is something I never even told Mark as it was something that I had always chalked up to as a nightmare until recently. Something clicked that it was very, very real. I was woken up at about 3:00 am by a "Get out of the house." Sound, it sounded barely human. Not the same voice as it was before. "Hungry." I could swear that I heard. I put the blanket over my head and stayed in bed. That lingering urge to run into the night started to overcome me again. Somehow, I resisted it and stayed inside. 

I could hear it speak a few more times throughout the night, the one thing that sent a chill down my spine was I could swear I heard it say, "Help me." In my friend Marks voice. I was to be frozen to even check in on him. He and I were staying in the same room at the time, so I figured he was safe. At one point and time I could swear I heard a dog yelp and the sound of chewing on bone. 

Once that happened it seemed to stop, I no longer felt the urge to run out. I looked at the clock, 3:45. only 45 minutes had passed, and it felt like hours. I stayed up until the sun hit and didn't sleep.

As the sun rays cracked through my windows, I could hear my stepdad get up to go to work and my mom slowly crawling out of bed to make breakfast. I had a sigh of relief and noticed Mark was still sleeping. Somehow, he slept through the whole night. I walked out to the kitchen and got my waffles and bacon that mom had made us and saw mom looking out the window a little distraught. "What's wrong?" I asked, she shook her head and said. "Stay inside." As she went outside. I looked out the window and saw her go up to our crying neighbor. I decided to disobey my mom and go outside. There was the neighbor's dog, eaten down to just a few bones. There was blood everywhere. 

To this day, we haven't said this story to anyone and kept this to each other. It is how we became best friends and to this day in our early 30s we still consider this what really bonded us to each other. I will leave you with this, if you're ever out in the middle of the night in Edgerton Wisconsin. Stay safe, in the light where people walk. The bars lit up at night and the gas station with the one stop light in town. Or you might end up like the Wilkerson's dog and not as lucky as Mark and me.
