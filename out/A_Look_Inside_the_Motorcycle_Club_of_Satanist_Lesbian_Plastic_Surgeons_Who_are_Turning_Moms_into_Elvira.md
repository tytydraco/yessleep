When the phrase “1%er Motorcycle Club” gets thrown around, our minds tend to flock to some of the more well known ones: The Hell’s Angels, The Pagans, The Sons of Anarchy, just to name a few. But there’s one group on the rise that is taking the nefarious niche by storm: Labia Rising.

Located in nearby but not entirely in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the lifestyle these ladies live is so crooked, so dastardly, that once you look into them, you can’t help but say B’Gosh. From running the local poppers and whippets distribution ring, to maintaining a state-wide monopoly on the roller derby gambling, these girls don’t wanna just have fun: they want to rule.

I first heard about them after rumors started swirling around that they were pushing their competition out of the midwest; numerous drive-by shootings on ‘Angels chapter buildings have been levied against them but time and time again, the evidence keeps coming up inconclusive. Almost a dozen Pagans have been taken out of their homes in the middle of the night, beaten senselessly, stripped down, forced to wear assless chaps, and hogtied outside of karaoke bars… the perpetrators of such offenses being “still at large.”

As a result, The Angels have moved all of their operations to Chicago and the Pagans to western Minnesota. There was a brief vacuum in Wisconsin, resulting in Labia Rising’s grip on the state getting tighter, possibly from kegels, more likely due to this self-proclaimed “diker gang’s” violent crusade and illicit activities (the most confounding of said activities, I would not be made privy to until I met with them in person).

I was able to set up an interview and ride-along via email. After a fifteen-hour drive, I found myself at the home base of Labia Rising.

After parking my mother’s Pontiac, I walked up to the side door of the building: a refurbished, abandoned fire-house that was painted black, with a giant neon vagina hanging above the garage. I knocked to the tune of “Shave and a Haircut,” as instructed” and the door swing open. The woman in the doorway (who was fifty but looked forty) was of Amazonian proportion and had a grin that could crack a mirror.

“You Jay?”

“I am.” I answered. She sized me up needlessly: she could’ve made an origami swan out of me with or without my permission. After a gander, she nodded, opened the door a little more, then led me down a long corridor; the walls of which were ordained (and I use that loosely) with framed polaroids of vulvas of all shapes, sizes, colors and (going strictly off of bush styles) creeds.

At the end of the hallway, there was a great room: this was the garage. In here were more mammoth, mammeried, motorcyclists: some played poker, others worked on bikes. Two were cutting lines of klonopin and cocaine, preparing to do them off of a pink-haired, twenty-something-year-old pixie’s chest. I asked if the ski slopes were complimentary, and was informed they were for members only. With my left eye stinging and swelling, I was led to the door of a backroom called “The Dark.” I was given scrubs to put on and then finally received permission to enter.

Mathilda was in the middle of a mammoplasty when I walked in; a woman with black dyed hair laid on the operating table in front of her. Her hands moved without care or cause for concern. She cut through those breasts like they were made of butter.

“I hope I’m not interrupting something.”

“Oh, boys have never distracted me before,” she replied as she rammed a silicone implant into the open wound of the left breast. “You wanted to ask some questions or something?”

“I did.” And I got answers as fast as the woman on the table got her new set of results. Mathilda was fifty-seven now and those first twenty-three years were rough. Born to a single mother, raised by the TV, she didn’t like having b-cups and she hated being poor, so she chose a career path that could cut two boobs with one scalpel. Did her own breasts at twenty-five (post graduation) and bought her first bike the same year. Found a couple other gals with similar affinities: bikes, dikes, and Cassandra Peterson.

“How long have you known that you, uh–”

“Wanted to shuck clams?”

“Let’s go with that,” I replied.

“Since I saw her.” She pointed to the woman on the table.

“Her specifically?”

“No. Elvira.” The Mistress of the Dark had a tight grip over, not just Mathilda, but all the ladies in Labia Rising. Possibly because of kegels, more likely due to untamable resolve and titillating gravitas. She was the sexual and spiritual awakening for these women. More so than that, she was a sigil of empowerment.

“She made her own beat and walked to it. She takes no bullshit,” Mathilda offered. “She gave us a feeling we want to give to other women.” She pointed back to the woman on the table. “This one’s recently divorced, a mother of three. Came here feeling lower than she ever thought she could feel. No one should feel like that.”

I could see it. These women had cultivated a community for themselves. An incredibly niche one, sure, but a tight one, centered around the idea of uplifting women. Amongst their ranks, Mathilda wasn’t just their leader, but the one of seven plastic surgeons. There were twelve hair stylists, nineteen cosmetologists, and five personal shoppers. Together, they formed a team that could bang out sixty Elvir-oplasties a week.

“But, why organized crime?”

“There weren’t a lot of safe spaces for us to be,” continued Mathilda, “being what we are, doing what we do, or riding what we ride. The bigger clubs started bringing trouble to us. I had enough of it. I took matters into my own hands one night. Found out real quick I wasn’t the only one willing to act.”

“You let them know you weren’t scared of them,” I offered.

“We did what we had to do. They aren’t in the state anymore. And we wouldn’t have been able to do it without… some guidance.” She started sewing up her work.

“What do you mean by that?” I asked. She turned to me.

“We’re doing a lot more than boobjobs and blow, these days.”

“Like what?” I asked, waiting anxiously to jot down her next words. But they didn’t come. Mathilda finished her stitching, gave her work a pat, and pulled her gloves off. She directed the anesthesiologist (who I hadn’t noticed till now) to wake her up and take her to the waiting room. She then walked over to the sink and began a washdown. She shook the water off her hands as she walked away from the sink and over to the portable desk she had by the operating table. Reaching into the tool tray, she pulled out a small silver bell.

“Like this.” she gestured for me to follow her back to the great room. I did.

She rang the bell just as we exited and her maidens rose to attention like tulips to the sun. She pointed at a younger looking woman, one of the snorters. The snorter nodded and sauntered over to, what appeared to be, a closet. She opened it as gracefully as she had gotten there, reached inside, and started to make her way over to us with, what appeared to be, a baseball bat. She got in front of me, her eyes locking in mine and she began to perform, what appeared to be, some kind of “beating me over the head with a baseball bat” ritual.

I awoke in another room I hadn’t seen before: I was strapped to a cold, stone alter; a red target painted to my now bare chest.

I was surrounded by the same sapphic scoundrels as before, yet now they donned coal-colored cloaks brandished daggers, and burned holes into my soul with their unblinking, yellowing eyes.

“You’re awake,” Mathilda said from behind. I tilted my chin as far back as my restraints would allow me. Her cloak, unlike the others, was red. She stood beneath a giant, framed painting of the Mistress of the Night: Elvira.

“Human Sacrifice?” I asked.

“Oh yeah,” she replied.

“To her?” I pointed with my chin. Mathilda nodded. I nodded back. I tried to wiggle my way out of my bonds. My stamina faltered quickly. “I assume ‘please’ won’t do me any favors?”

“Not today, no,” replied Mathilda. “Not unless it makes a difference with mother.”

“Oh, is she joining us today?” I asked.

“In spirit, yes.” With that, Mathilda gestured to another Amazon who was wielding a lit candelabra. The big broad nodded and her herculean hand brought the flame to a large bowl, the size of a big big bowl, and it immediately caught flame. The fire spread rapidly via a thin line of oil that wrapped around the entire room until it encircled us. “

“Your fate will be decided by the spirit of Cassandra Peterson’s portrayal of the Mother Goddess. Should she deem you a necessary thread in the cosmic stocking, you will live. And if not, you shall perish by her blades. Do you understand?”

“No, Not really if I am being honest.” I replied. Mathilda sighed at that.

“A pity.” I could tell she meant it. She then diverted her gaze to another Maiden of the Dark. “Tammy, flip the coin.” My eyes widened with horror.

“Wait a fucking second, you’re leaving this up to a–”

“It’s heads,” said Tammy. A collective whine filled the room.

“It appears as if the Mother of the Dark has a plan for you yet, mort–” I interrupted Mathilda before she could continue.

“Have you just been sacrificing people to Elvira based on a coin flip?”

“She works in mysterious ways.”

“Maybe so, but probability doesn’t!” I was fuming. Another woman spoke up from the left of me.

“Trial by combat was deemed to be an execution of God’s will for centuries, why can’t a coin flip with consequences serve the same purpose?” Nods of agreements and words of affirmation filled the halls of the sacrificial chamber. I was still in disbelief but I wasn’t going to argue with the mob of knife wielding tuna enthusiasts.

“Am I free to go?”

“Yes.” they all said. And I did, but not before signing the NDA I am currently violating and snorting a line of klono-caine. I made my way out the same way I came in, this time by my lonesome. As I did I tried to process everything: not just what I had lived through (and almost died by), but the story of this occult collective, their business dealings… and… the fact that, while I was being unstrapped from the altar, I could’ve sworn I was shot a wink and a smile by the painted profile of the Mistress of the Night…
