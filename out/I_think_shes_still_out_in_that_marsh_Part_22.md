I could feel my mind spinning out of control as the smell of the burning ghoul corpses began to divert my attention towards the scene unfolding behind the strange villagers. 

Reggie, who’s shotgun was being confiscated by several blackened and rotting folk, took a step towards the woman, but was quickly pushed back against the tree that seemed to create a looming dome around us all. The nasty woman approached us, holding the box that we brought all the way out into this horrible place. Her smile curled across her face like a worm pushing it’s way into a rotted corpse. She opened the box, revealing it’s contents to us all. 

Her voice pierced the thick air that threatened to choke us. It was like a woman and a fiendish animal were competing with alluring tones and hungry raspy growls to calm down it’s prey. “Oh, wicked outsiders, you have brought to us the tool that will bring my people their salvation, and free the Mother from her prison!”

As she spoke, the growing crowd of malformed swamp people chattered restlessly. The sound began to bounce off of the willow tree branches above in a cacophony of sweltering anger and excitement. Some of them were screaming “On with it, Isabelle!” Other villagers began chanting in that ancient Dutch dialect, some calling to “Mother” both with longing and with terror in their voices. 

I lost all hope in that moment. I couldn’t process it any longer, and in animalistic fear I began thrashing violently against the villagers who were now holding me against the tree as the wretched woman pulled a blackened and runed dagger from the black box and tossed the container aside. 

The blade was nothing special physically except for the runes… but the pulsating was a different story. It was difficult to focus on the blade, like looking at it hurt my head in a weird way and it seemed to almost vibrate in and out of reality. She ran her index finger across the side of it as she looked hungrily at the corpse of my brother.

“We will use his blood for the ritual.” Her voice was cold and slippery, yet somehow intoxicatingly comforting. I felt small, like prey aware of an apex predator lurking just beyond the mists around us, watching us look desperately for a way out of this hell hole.

“We’ll use these three as food for her. She prefers fresh and fear stricken prey over dead sacrifices.” She spat her words as several of her people dragged my brother’s headless corpse over to us at the base of the massive tree. They dropped him limply in front of the leader and she smiled grimly in the dim light that still barely poked through the fog all around the tree. 

The sun was glowing with shades of purple and red as it slowly dipped sightlessly over the far horizon. The world around us was slowly falling into shadow as the villagers began to turn on powerful flash lights and light torches and lanterns. The light of the flaming ghouls danced menacingly across the whole grisly scene. Shadows 

The woman dropped to her knees and began using the knife to slice open Trey’s chest cavity. The blade carved his flesh with relative ease, only snagging when it caught against his ribs. She snapped the bone with the blade and began peeling the flesh back with her free hand. As she moved the knife into the gaping wound on his corpse, she began cutting the sinews and fleshy muscles encasing his heart. She produced his heart with her free hand, a look of reckless delight overtaking her gnarled features. 

Two of the marsh folk pulled aside Trey’s corpse, and the vile woman approached us at the tree. As she did, she spoke frantically in a language that to this day, I can’t find anything that hints at it’s origins. I think it is a dead language. It was haunting, like the syllables of latin were fused with the  pained cries of a boar. She lifted the knife in one hand and the heart in the other, placing the bloody and now slowly pumping organ against the rune that was painted on the tree.

When she stabbed it, the thick air seemed to implode around us as the fog instantly came barreling into the once dome-like area around us. The air crackled and the tree behind us groaned and almost writhed as the villagers looked around, just as shocked as we were. I heard Croc gasp and let out a few “shit’s” and “fuck’s” as we all realized that this woman may have doomed us all. The last glimpse I caught of her face as the fog slammed into us told me she was just as surprised as everyone else.

Suddenly, we couldn’t see a fuckin’ thing. But I was close enough to the tree to see that something wasn’t right with it anymore. As I watched breathlessly through the rolling fog, I could barely make it out as the base of the massive willow tree began to uproot from the muck and mud and a set of what appeared to be spindly arm-like branches began tearing from the surface of the bark, pulling itself further in a shaky and almost glitchy movement.

Purplish-black ooze began dripping from the cracks and crevices on the tree’s trunk. Even more sets of the long skinny arms began spreading out of the trunk along the part I could see and into the mists that surrounded us all. It looked like flesh melded with the body of a wood plated centipede as it slowly reached higher and higher into the fog above. It was hard to focus on any one part of it as it’s surface melded flesh to plant.

I could see the flashlights and torches blazing just beyond the veil of the dark yellow fog as the villagers called out in confusion. The sounds of straining tree branches in the wind began to creak all around us. The smell of death began encircling us and I wanted to scream with every shred of my being. Nothing came out but a slight exasperated breath of shock.

That’s when I heard the sound. Like a whip slicing through the air, I could see the silhouette of a tendril-like branch pierce through the chest of one of the villagers in the flickering torch light that he held tightly in his hand, even when the branch pulled him up into the abyss above like a helpless and uncontrollable puppet. I watched his silhouette wrench violently up into the fog, only to disappear into swirling blackness as the torch dropped from his limp hands and fell into the growing chaos below. We could hear more whipping branches in the dark. I could feel ice cold chills rolling down my spine one vertebrae at a time. 

I hissed a whisper to my friends, “Let’s get the fuck out of here while they’re busy.” We started to move away, towards the burning ghoul pile that was slowly dying down in the thickened atmosphere.

The leader of the villagers spoke quietly inches from my ear, hidden by fog, “Only one of us can escape the Mother now.” Her harrowing voice sent me into a small frenzy as I swung my fist around to try and knock her off her feet. I spun into the fog uselessly and realized she was nowhere to be found. I couldn’t see more than a foot in the dark fog now, the sun had completely faded away. The whole place looked like an alien planet by now, completely swallowed in an ancient mist that humanity had long ago forgotten.

Croc grabbed me by the shoulder and spun me around to look at him. “Calm down, son, now look at me.” He met me eye to eye, barely visible in the fog. Reggie wrestled his shotgun back during the craziness going on around us, the flashlight attachment shining brightly nearby and illuminating the ground between the three of us. Croc looked at Reggie and whispered, “Shut that shit off, boy. Yer’ gonna’ get us killed.” Before he could retort, Reggie’s voice caught in his throat. 

We watched as one of the villagers tore through the fog nearby, only to have pincer-like branches pierce through their knee. The sound of pierced flesh and crackling bone was only barely drowned out by the village woman’s shrieks of pain as she was violently ripped upwards into the fog.

Reggie stepped away from us, shotgun aimed upwards and flashlight beam shaking as he searched wildly into the darkness around us. He made one more turn all the way around when the light from his weapon illuminated what I can only describe as the devil itself. In the fog I only caught a glimpse of it’s true hulking form, but what little I could make out will haunt my nightmares to this day.

A huge form lurked just beyond the veil before us, like a centipede reaching down from the trees above. Black spindly arms reached out above us and kept it held afloat above the ground, it’s body reaching above and beyond our comprehension. The part I could make out was at least thirty feet long. The part I could see was the form of a surreal mass  of flesh and tree hanging in the darkness, with a woman’s head atop it’s form. She had what looked like huge Ram horns curled above her head, they almost looked like they had wriggling flesh hanging off of them. It’s jaw was bisected into spider-like fangs that were dripping with either ooze or venom, I couldn’t tell in the fog, even with his light reflecting off of it’s otherworldly features. It appeared to be made of both flesh and tree, it seemed like it was slowly transforming between the two constantly. The air around it was being swallowed by a shadow that seeped it’s way into my sight and made it difficult to make out it’s full appearance.

Reggie screamed in blind terror as he began firing shells up into the form of the monster before us. As each shot went off, I could see more of the monster’s form in the light of the muzzle flashes. With the first shot, he blew part of it’s face off. It shrieked in strange high pitched tone, like an animal that was surprised and in pain. As the second shot went off, I started to fumble for my own gun and the monster seemed to shift out of the way of his blast. He shot two more blasts into it’s form as it writhed past us. 

It’s face remerged in the flashlight beam just for a split second as Reggie shouted in fear again, the shotgun being torn from his hands by one of the spindly looking branch arms. I could see his form writhing in pain as more of the branches pierced his body from legs to shoulders. The light illuminated the fear in his eyes for a split second before Croc and I heard a choking sound coming out of Reggie’s throat.

One final muzzle flash lit up the inside of Reggie’s head and from his throat as the back of his neck exploded from his own shotgun in a shower of blood and bone. Croc grabbed my arm and forced me to turn and run. As we took off, the sounds of twisting trees and shivering leaves, the villagers dying all around us, and the sounds of gunfire and growing flames began to penetrate my senses. The smell of burning wood and rotted flesh told us that the villagers weren’t having a very good time, either. Fear was trying to pry it’s ugly claws through my mind as I tried to make sense of all the crazy shit taking place around us.

We had to fight our way through some of the villagers who were searching for us in the fog. I put down several rifle toting men who barely saw us in the dark when I opened fire. Others would grip and grab at us, trying to bring us back to their leader. One of them shot at me with a hand gun, but missed as one the branches twisted his head right off his body like a macabre cork popping into the chilled night air. I watched as branches tried to reach for Croc and I, but we kept moving, shooting and reloading as we went.

As we started to run, I saw Reggie’s lifeless corpse fly over our heads. It thumped ahead of us, rolling with a sickening twisting motion. We had to leap over him on our way out. I felt horrible… but that thing was right behind us. I could sense it in the ever growing darkness, hear it rumbling just above, hunting us, and killing everything in it’s path. 

My feet were numb from the cold mud and waters of the marsh, my mind was numb from the day’s events. I wordlessly followed Croc into an endless forest that made no sound. The only sounds were chaos and the screams and they began to fade into a ghostly echo. Eventually, all I could hear was the occasional gun firing off, or the sound of shivering branches swaying overhead in the distance, and our labored breaths as we trudged wordlessly into the void. 

At one point, a villager with a torch and an axe came barreling through the fog at us. He was muttering about the Mother in the trees needing to be fed just before Croc put a couple well placed bullets into his gut and head, and we continued into the fog, in the direction that I was praying to whatever-deity-you-believe in was back south towards the road. We saw a few more groups of them in various states of mind, but none of them noticed us as we slipped through the darkness.

We ran for what felt like hours, almost a whole day, but that couldn’t be, because the sun never came back up. We ran and ran until Croc couldn’t go any more. He told me to leave him there and that he would figure it out, but I wasn’t going to leave that old bastard behind after all we had been through. 

We set up a makeshift camp with some brush leaves and branches. I tried to make a camouflaged hut, and every time I had to snap a branch or move something, the sound echoed out into the dark and swirling fog that swallowed everything around us. We decided a fire was worth the risk, rather than freezing to death in our sleep. Croc shared an MRE with me and everything was dead silent in the marsh. We ate quickly, and I stayed up to watch while Croc tried to get some sleep near the slowly dying fire on the only dry spot we could find in this horrible place.

I sat leaning against a small tree nearby, my uzi still in hand. I watched as the flame slowly died out, as Croc twisted and turned tying to find comfort in sleep, I watched as the fog seemed to slowly clear up a bit and the moon light pierced through the thick trees above. At some point, I passed out… probably from exhaustion. 

When I came to, my senses slowly reviving, I realized the sounds of shaking tree limbs and violently rustling leaves were just overhead. The fire had long gone out, and the moonlight had also flickered away. The fog had come back in a fierce haze. I could hear a soft crying above us, like a saddened woman, yet it was fused with the low braying of a goat. It sounded sad, yet frustrated. The trees around us shook and tumbled under the weight of the demon as it stalked the cold marsh in search of it’s sacrifice. A heavy, dark liquid seeped from her jaws onto the muck below, slowly mixing in with it as I watched.

I decided not to wake Croc, and I held perfectly still while that thing kept slithering right on by. I could hear it’s body navigating the branches above, long after the pitiful sound of it’s hungry wailing disappeared into the depths of mist and trees. Ten painfully quiet moments of scuttling limbs. It was the biggest damn living thing I had ever witnessed. It’s body seemed to pose in and out of our world as it went, contorting at odd angles and creating shadows with no light source needed. It seemed to be sweeping the whole damn marsh for us. At that point, I didn’t even give a shit... I just wanted to go home, have my brothers back… 

I fell asleep again. When I woke up, Croc was already getting up and ready to go. We had no idea if we went the right way or not, and either way, we didn’t care. A lot of the fog was cleared up by now and we could see a good distance. We figured out what direction was south and started moving as soon as we were ready. We walked for a few hours, before finally coming to a break in the marsh. A lone, poorly kept road was running east and west. 

I spoke quietly, as not to disturb the woods, “I think this road takes us to our bikes if we head that way,” I nodded to the east.

Croc massaged his bearded chin, “Not sure how far away it is from here. If we head the other way, we’s might be lucky enough to hit that other town, the one that didn’t have those freaks in em’.” I felt a shudder down my spine just thinking about those culty assholes. No way was I looking to see them again.

We went towards the town, thinking it should be closer to us and further from those backwoods beings. We walked an hour or so before the town sign popped into view. By then we were completely exhausted, completely drained from the previous night. I was ready to collapse.

The morning sun was finally shining through the trees that surrounded the little town. We took a sidewalk that went through the middle of town and made our way to a gas station at the edge of town. Not many people stirred around the town, it was still early morning, and people here were lazily living small town life on a Saturday. I pressed on the double glass doors and we shuffled into the room, a little country town gas station. 

The woman at the register looked at us with wide eyes, and at that point I realized we must have looked like shit. I peeked at Croc and saw he was caked in dried mud and blood, branches and leaves were sticking out of his clothes and hair, and I guarantee I looked no better myself. I was still clutching to my uzi with a tense grip. The woman at the cash register put her hands up, and Croc let out a weirdly tense laugh. 

“Ma’am,” he said “We have had the worst type of night out in those woods. We mean ya’ no harm, we just need a little help is all.” With that, he set his pistol on the ground by the door. I took my weapon and begrudgingly set it beside his gun. Seeing this, the girl relaxed a bit, but quickly asked if we need a hospital or the police. 

I leaned on a nearby counter, feeling fatigued, and asked, “Are there any mechanics here in town?” The girl quickly leaned over and pointed at an advertisement for “Izzy’s Auto Shack”. She pressed her finger against it excitedly.

“Go right up Main Street, you can’t miss it.” She looked happy to help and waved off to us as we grabbed our weapons at the door and went up the road of the little town. I figure she would be calling the cops soon, so we booked it across the town.

People kept to themselves in this little town, for the most part. Some of the homes were modern, but many were crappy broken down places. They looked happy enough here, but the town certainly was not doing well with money. I could feel some of the locals staring at me from just out of sight, behind buildings or cars, sometimes shadows in the trees. These people were not accustomed to strangers walking through their community. We kept our guns out of sight the best we could, but I could tell we were starting to spook some of them.

We made it to Izzy’s within a few minutes of walking, It was a run down looking garage with some broken down vehicles littering the front and back of the property. The building was old and rusted, with cracked windows and walls. The smell of gasoline and mold slowly wafted from the place as we approached. 

An old man was cleaning the window of a pick up truck, limping from one side to the other with some difficulty. Croc approached him while I kept darting my eyes around the streets, paranoia plaguing my mind ever since the night before,

When Croc asked about getting our bikes towed, the old man nodded and in a raspy voice said “Well, my boys can do that for you when they get back. They left last night with Izzy to do some scavenging, as far as I know. They come back with all sorts of junk that gets left out in that marsh.” The man limped painfully over close to us, trying to disguise his discomfort with a smile. “They’ll be home any minute now,”

I kept looking at the old man’s leg. It looked like it was leaking blackish liquid through his jeans. I quickly walked over and demanded he show us his wound. He nervously looked up at me and looked over his shoulder, back into the dark garage behind him. Croc quickly made his way to the old man and pointed his gun, yelling for him to “Let us see the damage, old man!” When he finally did, we both had to keep from vomiting.

He had a gushing purple mass growing from the side of his lower leg and ankle. It twisted and oozed like an entity with a mind of it’s own. A familiar sickly sweet decay smell swept over us, and the man nervously started stammering, “T-t-this morning it got worse, all of a sudden it was moving and growing, I don’t know why! Please, you gotta believe me mister!” He started sobbing as the mass on his leg twitched aggressivly on his body. I started looking around the garage in front of us, and loaded in a truck trailer at the back was…

“Our fuckin’ bikes!” I practically cheered out as I saw all five of our motorcycles lined up in the back. I started moving towards them when from the corner of my eye, I saw the old man pop up from behind a countertop in the garage. He had a shotgun leveled right at me. Before I could get my uzi aimed, I heard a glock fire several rounds to my right, Croc cracked a small grin and gave me a nod when I looked his way. As we made our way into the open garage door, the sound of pure evil creaked through a familiar voice from behind us. It was the leader of the marsh folk, Isabelle.

Her voice was even more monstrous than before, like she fought to keep her humanity in check in every word. “We must finish the feeding of the Mother. If not… She will take us, my children.” As she spoke those words, people covered in fleshy black sores and tendrils began approaching from behind the now heavily mutated leader Isabelle. The tendrils that came out of her eye socket now reached out and wriggled slowly into the air, her yellow eye bulbous and sticking out further, it rolled about to keep track of us. “Now, the hour is nigh, my people! Take them to the marsh, or be taken!” 

The growing crowd seemed to be in a state of hysteria. Some were laughing, some were cheering, others were screaming or crying, one asked me to shoot her. They slowly approached the open garage we now stood in. Quickly, Croc ran up and grabbed the garage door handle and began yanking it while running towards the door way. A few villagers were close to the entrance, so I started spraying bullets through under the door while it closed down. It thudded over a set of someone’s fingers and crushed them with a sickening crunch and splashing of blood. I started putting the locks in place, sweating bullets and trying to keep my head together.

I kicked open the locked door that lead further into the auto shop. We stumbled into a dimly lit work area and Croc instantly got to work searching for materials to prepare some contraptions. I looked around for any sort of maps of the area, and managed to find some older paper maps that were probably accurate enough to go by. When I got back to Croc, he had fashioned together a few home made bombs from the chemicals and canisters laying about and was already planting some along the garage door while the sounds of the villagers slamming into it rang through the building. I could hear the villagers digging at the walls and windows with their hands and axes and shovels, trying to find some way into the place to rip us to shreds.

Croc looked at me seriously, “When these bad boys go off, you take off like a bat out of hell, and don’t look back. I’ll meet ya’ back home if we get separated.”

We got both our bikes down from the trailer and lined them up, ready to escape this shit show of a circus act. Croc counted down from three. The sounds of windows inside the building breaking started to mess with my head, but I hunkered down. They were chanting and slamming into the large door. As Croc got to one, the door exploded open in a blinding light, debris barely missing the both of us. 

Fog flooded into the building from outside, the putrid yellowy mass had made it’s way into town during all of this. We both gunned our bikes forward, bumping and smashing over the villagers who were knocked over in the blast, some lay dead, others trying to get back up and ending up crushed under our spinning bike tires. Croc dropped another few bombs on our way out, leaving many villagers flailing in our wake. 

The sounds of screaming civilians ripped through the fog that surrounded us. I could hear people being shot at, burned… I saw a pair of the marsh folk slicing out a man’s eyes while they held him to the ground. The whole town was being ravaged by these freaks. There was nothing we could do for them all, so we kept driving. 

Suddenly, from beyond the fog, that damned woman Isabelle ran at us with inhuman speed. I was still going somewhat slow to avoid crashing on our way out, and she caught up to us. She leapt at me from a short distance, hanging on to me as we drove faster and faster. She tried with all her might to flip the bike over or pull me off of it. 

I wasn’t going to give this bitch the satisfaction of killing me. I pulled my uzi out with my free hand and kept my bike on the road with the other. I tried to hang it over my shoulder to blast her in the face, but she was strong and quickly gripped my arm and yanked us to the side of the road. My bike went off the street and we ended up in the yard of one of the nicer houses we saw in town. I searched for my gun, but when I couldn’t find it I pulled my Bowie knife out of my boot hilt and prepared myself mentally. 

She quickly jumped up off of the ground and ran full force into me, slamming against a car that was abandoned on the sidewalk during the initial attack. As she pushed hard to pin me against the car, I could hear shuddering tree branches moving above us in the thick fog. The familiar whipping sound began to flood the air around us as more people were screaming as they were pulled into the void.

She held me there and looked up into the fog, smiling with a hellish noise erupting from her mouth. As she did, I stabbed her in her unprotected shoulder. She angrily hissed as her skin began to decay from her skull, the black tendrils in her eye socket now desperately out stretched and trying to rend at my eyes. As they reached for me her face skin stretched out with it, trying to keep her head from splitting apart. Even as she oozed the putrid smelling goo from the slowly tearing seems of flesh, she showed no signs of stopping or pain. 

Villagers surrounded us and began to mock and jeer at me, and cheer for their leader. I knew I was dead as her elastic skin slowly separated from her head, revealing sharp fangs poking out of the bottom of the tendrils. Fresh blood flowed from the wounds where the fangs had been dug into her head, and she gave me a grin that would curl the devil’s spine. I could feel my end quickly approaching in that cold fucked up town. 

I was barely holding her back when I heard Croc’s bike coming in hot before I could see the headlight illuminating one of the villagers from behind. Several explosions went off behind them, and my old guardian angel came in, a lead pipe in hand. He bashed that disgusting monster over the head with it, knocking teeth from her skull and sending the tendril lump out of her head and writhing on the floor. She shrieked in pain and terror as she fell to the ground feeling for the mass of moving flesh.

“My gift! No! You worthless heathens, you will die by my hand!” She shrieked in an ungodly tone as she lifted the mass flesh up and tried to force it back into her open eye socket. The sound of squelching flesh and flowing blood kept me there a moment longer before the sound of croc’s bike revving up got my attention. I ran and picked up my own bike which hadn’t been too damaged the scuffle. I kicked her back on, and we both started peeling out, flying between countless village folk and the civilians who were fleeing them.

In my head, the leader’s voice began to cry out in fear and anguish, “No! Come back, insufferable worm! You must be hers or I will-” A sudden sharpness cut her voice off from my mind, and in the woods just beyond the garage I could hear the sound of shivering tree branches and anguished crying slithering about. It was coming. I could not see her very clearly by then, and I only looked over my shoulder long enough to see Isabelle’s arms get ripped from her torso by the pincers of the Mother. 

The fog swallowed the villagers and houses as I rode forth. I followed the road out of town, hoping the people would end up safe. My mind was shattered by then and I wanted more than anything to be rid of this whole damned place. I didn’t realize I had lost Croc in the fog until I was out of it, finally riding in the open and clear world once again.

I drove all the way home, stopping only for food, gas, and sleep. It took me quite awhile to make it back. I took the scenic route. I was pretty sure nothing followed me out. When I did finally make it, I found Croc there waiting at the club house. 

I didn’t want anything to do with that shit anymore, and when the boys found out about Trey’s death, the whole thing devolved into in-fighting and bull shit politics Most of the gang took off. Croc and I went our separate ways. Never heard from that old bastard again. I miss him every day. I held a makeshift funeral for my brother and the others. I miss them, too.

Now I just live a simple life. I try to put that night behind me every day. Although sometimes at night… Especially on the foggy nights, I swear I can still hear the sound of branches slowly churning about in the woods. The eyes of the Mother ever present in my dreams. I don’t think she is out there looking for me…

But I keep my guns around, just in case. Don't think I'll be getting that good night's sleep any time soon.
