This afternoon I decided to take a nap and I fell into a sleep paralysis like dream. This has happened to me before but this time was very different. Unlike a sleep paralysis dream I could fully move around, breath, and see perfectly clear. A few different thing would happen but it was like I was in a loop. Every time I thought I had woken up it would just start all over.

The first thing that happened was I thought I was awake and I had the urge to run outside of my apartment as fast as I possibly could. But when I opened the door and left I did not recognize the outside of my apartment. I also found that running was completely effortless and all the colors around me were brightened like there was an enhancement filter on my eyes. There were also people I did not recognize outside but I could not recognize them and I really did not care because I was so focused on running as far away as fast as possible.

The second thing that would happen when I thought I had woken up was I would feel the need to get into my closet, shut the doors, and hide under my dirty cloths. I was aware that what I was doing was weird but I could not help myself. It was like I needed to do it and had no control.

The third thing that would happen is that I would get on the ground and feel like I was being pulled underneath my bed frame. I could distinctly feel the strong hands grab my ankles and pull me deeper than what my bed frame should be.

I am not sure how many times these things would loop but it felt like a lot. And in-between these loops I was visited by an entity called voelrate. I cannot remember what it looked like or what it said to me other than its name. But I do remember that when it was speaking to me that was the only time I did not feel that dark panic that comes with sleep paralysis. 

When I actually woke up I was in a daze and more tired than when I went to sleep. There were also these checked spirals baked into my vision for a minute or two. I immediately left my apartment and I am writing this from a coffee shop because I felt like I was being watched if I had stayed at my place.

I feel like I need to get back to that space to let this entity speak to me again but I am afraid it could be a trap and also afraid to be caught in a sleep paralysis loop again. I also cannot tell my family about this because they are religious and believe that sleep paralysis is a form of demon possession. 

I do not know if I should be seeking out voelrate again if I get caught in another loop tonight when I go to sleep. Or if I should try and wake myself up if I feel its presence again. I cannot guarantee any updates as I cannot control when I have sleep paralysis. But I cannot help but feel like I will be visited again soon.
