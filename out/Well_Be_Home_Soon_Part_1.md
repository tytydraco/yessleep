Jodi and I played a game on the drive up to the cabin. Every time he saw a car with an out-of-state license plate, I had one minute to find another from a state that didn’t share a border with it. If I did, then I scored a point. If I couldn’t, then Jodi scored. Either of us could start the game at any time by calling out the State. It was so much fun that mom and dad even began playing against each other. Dad managed to find an “Alaska” plate and thought he had mom beat but she managed to find a plate all the way from Canada that said “Yukon” on it at the last second.

Dad groaned and we all laughed when mom did a little victory dance. I go back to that memory a lot because it was the last truly good day we had as a family.

Uncle Roy was already waiting at the cabin when we pulled up late that morning. There was a small Jon boat on a trailer behind his truck and what looked like at least a dozen fishing rods bristling from the boat like quills on a porcupine. He was bent over in the yard when we parked, scooping something out of the dirt.

“I have this hunch you’re going fishing, Roy,” my dad said, hauling bags from the back of our van.

Roy smiled and held up a mason jar filled with thick, reddish-brown worms so my dad could see.

“Nightcrawlers, Jim. This place is lousy with them. And the river is hardly half-an-hour away from here. You all picked a great spot.”

Mom moved past the two men, carrying grocery bags. “We picked a great spot for a family vacation, Roy. We got the big cabin so you could have your own room, so don’t spend all week on the river.”

“Two days,” Uncle Roy said, holding up one hand palm out. “Three days, tops. Scout’s honor.”

Dad snorted. “You were never a Boy Scout.”

“Sure I was! Tell him, Rachel.”

Mom sighed. “Technically, Jim, I guess he was but they kicked him out after about a month.”

I put my bag down and looked at the worms. “Why’d you get kicked out of the Boy Scouts Uncle Roy?”

He winked. “I’ll tell you, one day, Cara, but right now, I think your brother needs help with that luggage before he keels over.”

Jodi had loaded himself with as many duffle bags and weekend supplies as he could carry and then grabbed a few more. He was trembling, but managed to carry everything into the cabin. We were planning to stay for a week, to hike the surrounding forest, tube in the river, and get away from the world. It was Jodi and my last week of summer vacation before returning to school. He would be starting ninth grade and I would be going into seventh.

The cabin was huge and old and way, way out, as my dad would say. There were no neighbors anywhere that we could see and, while there was a dirt utility road for access, the place was completely surrounded by dense, Western Maryland woods. It had no internet or cell reception, not even electricity. The only way to contact the outside world was a satellite phone that mom bought the day before the trip.

I could see hills all around us and the blue ripple of mountains lifting up the horizon. The weather was hot but cooler under the shade of the trees. A breeze carried over forest sounds; chirps and crickets and the occasional back-and-forth of birds singing to each other. I helped Uncle Roy find a few more nightcrawlers for his jar and couldn’t remember the last time it felt so good just being outside.

Uncle Roy drove off for the river without even seeing inside the cabin. When I walked through the front door, I immediately wished I’d gone with him. The living room was big and open, ending in a stone fireplace that took up most of the far wall. The walls were rough wood and looked like they were full of splinters. Everything was messy, with dust on the floors and dark stains spread around the cabin.

“Is that…?” mom asked, trailing off.

Dad leaned close to one of the stains on the wall. “No, it’s…wine, maybe? Looks like wine but smells a little like, um, I’m going to say ink.”

“Whatever it is, the stuff’s all over the house,” mom said, wrinkling her nose. “This place is kind of chaotic.”

“For how cheap we got it, Rachel, we’re lucky the place isn’t actively on fire.”

The rest of the cabin was equally messy. There were piles of old clothes, dirt, dust, overturned furniture, and more of the dark stains all over. Every room had this stale, overly sweet smell even after we opened all of the windows. We spent the first hour cleaning. Jodi made a game out of it for me, a kind of race. Ever since I got sick the year before and had to go to the hospital for a while, Jodi was always coming up with new games to play with me.

“Hey, everybody, want to see something crazy?” Dad called out from the back of the cabin when we were nearly done cleaning.

We found him standing in front of the closet in the cabin’s smallest bedroom. The door was open but dad was blocking whatever made him call for us.

“It’s not a dead animal or something, is it, Jim?”

Dad whistled. “It’s an ‘or something,’ alright.”

He moved so the three of us could get a look inside the closet. All of the walls were speckled with dark stains. A bare lightbulb dangled from the ceiling on a chain. The closet was empty other than a single shelf. Something reddish-brown shaped like the head of a man sat on the shelf. A piece of paper with the words, “Lighten Your Burden,” scrawled in shaky handwriting was taped above the head.

“What is it?” I asked. “A statue?”

“Kind of,” mom replied. “It looks like a bust. Which is like a statue but just the head and upper parts.”

“I think it’s copper,” dad said. “Or maybe bronze? I’m guessing…Roman?”

“Roman, Ohio, maybe,” mom said. “I’m sure it’s a knockoff.”

Jodi leaned in close. “Pretty sure it’s Greek.”

We all stared at him.

“What?” he asked. “I’ve been researching ancient Greece. We read The Iliad in school last spring.”

“In eighth grade?” mom asked.

“Okay, I read The Iliad last spring. It’s a good book. They should teach it in middle school.”

Dad lifted up the bust. “Greek, Roman, French, Narian, whatever it is, it’s pretty wild, right?”

It was wild. The man’s face was bearded but still young and beautiful. He was smiling widely, almost like he was about to start laughing. The smile didn’t reach his eyes, though. They seemed cold and hard. I told myself it was because it was a sculpture.

Dad shook the bust and raised an eyebrow when it made a sloshing sound.

“Hello, hello,” he said, finding a hinge that made the man’s head open just above the eyes. “Hey Rachel, our friend is full of something.”

He held the statue out for mom. She sniffed and made a face.

“Whatever it is, it smells like gasoline mixed with grape juice.”

Dad brought the bust under his nose. “Wow. Yeah. Though, I think it might be wine.” He sniffed again. “Definitely. And it smells kind of…good?”

Mom took the bust. “Huh. Yeah. The, eh, aroma grows on you, I guess.”

“‘Lighten Your Burden,’” dad said, pointing to the sign. “Gotta be wine.”

“Ew,” I said.

I could smell whatever was in the bust and, as far as I could tell, it reeked.

“You guys don’t know what it is, though,” Jodi added. “It smells weird.”

“Really?” mom asked. “The more I’m around it, the better it smells.”

Dad took a big whiff. “Same. Maybe it’s a gift from the cabin owners? Maybe we’re the 100th family to rent the AirBnB or something. Damn that smells good. Rachel, I’m going to have a sip-”

“Dad,” Jodi interrupted.

“Just a sip. Just to try it out. I’m sure it’s safe and, even if it’s strychnine, I’m sure a sip won’t hurt me.”

“It would literally kill you,” Jodi said.

“Pour me a taste, too, Jim,” mom said.

Jodi and I both stared at her in shock. Dad gave into impulse now and then but mom was always no nonsense.

She blushed. “I’m sure it’s fine. And it really does smell like…well, it smells like summer. It smells like the best summer of my life.”

“I think it smells gross,” Jodi said.

I nodded but dad just shrugged and brought the bust into the kitchen. We watched as he poured a sip of the dark, almost black wine into a solo cup for himself, then for mom. After their first sip, they each went back for a full glass, then another. They didn’t stop until the container was empty. I think dad would have licked it clean if Jodi and I weren’t watching.

I’d never seen mom or dad drunk before that night. By dinner time, they were both slurring their words. Mom kept nodding off while cooking until Jodi took over. Dad was the opposite, energetic and talkative.

Mom and dad both seemed happy, so I tried to smile along with them, but they were starting to scare me a little. Dad brought out a speaker and turned on music, sweeping mom up into dance after dance, which made her giggle. They kicked up the stubborn dirt and dust we hadn’t been able to scrub from the floorboards earlier.

Jodi watched everything from the thin, frumpy couch near the fireplace. He made room for me to sit next to him after dinner. When I started getting sad that mom and dad were busy dancing and laughing, he said we should play a game.

We ended up playing hide and seek all over the cabin for most of the night. I fell asleep sometime around eleven after Jodi made up one of the beds for me. I could still hear mom and dad dancing as I nodded off. Mom did come in for a second to kiss me good night. Her breath smelled awful and her lips and teeth had dark wine stains but I did feel better after she kissed my cheek.

“Goodnight my little loves…little lovely,” mom slurred, kissing my cheek again before turning off the light.

My face tingled where she’d kissed me. I lifted my fingers to my cheek and felt something cold and wet. The smell hit me, then, and I choked. It smelled just like whatever was in the bust, like plants rotting or wet trash. I didn’t understand what about the liquid could possibly cause them to drink the man dry. I wiped my cheek with the blanked and put a pillow over my head to muffle the sound of my dad singing, “Born to be Wild,” until I drifted off to sleep.

I woke up from a strange dream full of melting faces desperately needing to pee. There was no noise coming from outside of the room so I figured mom and dad were in bed. Quietly, carefully, I opened the door and stepped into the hall. The bathroom was only a few steps away but it felt like miles moving through the absolute dark of the cabin. Something was wrong with the hallway light switch; I walked slowly, feeling my way against the wall until I reached the bathroom door.

I finished and washed up, yawned, and then opened the door. It only moved a few inches before colliding with something in the hall.

“Sorry,” I whispered, guessing I’d just hit mom, dad, or Jodi on their own way to the bathroom.

After waiting a second, I pushed on the door again, expecting whoever I’d hit to have backed up. But, once again, the door only opened about the length of my hand before it became stuck.

“Um…sorry…is someone there?” I asked. “Jodi?”

Something pushed back from the other side of the door, hard enough that it slammed and made me stumble back a step. It caught me so off-guard that I nearly fell.

“Jo…Jodi?” I asked. “Mom? Dad?”

Whoever was in the hallway started to breathe heavily, almost wheezing. My hand was shaking when I reached for the doorknob.

“If you’re playing a joke on me, it’s not funny,” I said, trying to sound more angry than afraid.

For the third time, I gently pushed the door open. It moved farther than before until it was about one-third of the way open. That’s when it became stuck again. A diagonal slash of light spilled from the bathroom into the hallway but it seemed watery and weak and didn’t help me see who was behind the door anyway.

Fingers appeared on the edge of the door, then most of a hand. A second hand appeared and then an eye. Someone was looking at me but it was too dark to tell if it was mom, dad or Jodi.

“You should be in bed,” a voice said.

Like the eye, the voice was familiar but distorted just enough that I couldn’t be sure if it was mom or dad talking, though I was certain it was one of them.

“I had to pee,” I squeaked, suddenly not sure if this was happening or if I was asleep.

The eye was staring at me from the dark. “You should run to your room.”

“Why?”

“It’s late and dark. You should run to your room.”

“But why…why should I run?” I stammered.

The hands and eye disappeared behind the door. “Because I’ll be right behind you.”

The door suddenly swung open freely just as the light in the bathroom died. I ran blindly, hoping I was heading for my bedroom door and that I’d left it open. There was a thud behind me in the hall, then a terrible scratching noise that followed me right up to the edge of my doorway. Luckily, my aim was good and the bedroom door was open. I slammed it as soon as I was in and held the doorknob, fumbling for the lock. Someone tried to turn the knob just as I clicked the lock.

The handle rattled once then twice then stopped. I heard soft, raspy laughter from the hall. It sounded like more than one voice. Much more than one voice. Then the cabin was silent once again. It took me a long time to fall back asleep.

Jodi woke me up for breakfast the next morning. He’d let me sleep in late and already had bacon and eggs ready. There was enough for all of us but mom and dad were still out cold, slumped together on the ratty couch. Cans and wrappers were scattered around them, as well as an empty box. They’d brought a case of beer meant to last the whole trip but I realized they must have finished it that first night, as well as half of the snacks we’d packed.

“Are mom and dad okay?” I asked Jodi.

“Sure. Of course. They just had a little too much fun last night.”

He smiled but he sounded worried, as much as he tried to hide it. I glanced over at the bust. Mom or dad had moved it to the mantle over the fireplace. It stared out over the living room, grin wide but eyes dead as the metal it was made from. I shifted my plate and moved into a different chair so I wouldn’t have to face the thing.

“Are we still going hiking today?” I asked Jodi. “I’d like to see the river.”

He cleared my plate for me. “Sure thing, chicken wing. We can go as soon as mom and dad wake up.”

We spent the rest of the morning tidying up around the cabin. Our parents slept through the clatter of cans and the sweeping and even Jodi opening all of the curtains and windows. Dad was snoring and both of them had strange, sleepy grins, their lips and teeth black from the wine. When neither of them were awake by lunchtime, I started getting worried.

“Should we call Uncle Roy?” I asked.

“I don’t think we need to. Not, yet, at least. Plus, I don’t know where they put the satellite phone.”

“They’re okay, right?”

Jodi tried to smile and mostly got there. “Definitely. Listen to dad snore. That’s a happy snore. I’m sure they’ll be awake soon.”

But I saw the way he looked at them, especially mom. My brother was even more anxious than I was. We all loved each other but Jodi and mom were best friends on top of all of that. They both loved reading old books, going to museums, and even looked the most alike of any of us with their sandy-brown hair and sharp, fox-faces. It wasn’t like mom to act so out of control; not like dad, either, but especially not like mom.

When neither of them were up by mid-afternoon, Jodi took me on a hike. We followed narrow trails through green and shadowy woods until we reached the river bank. Even though I knew he wouldn’t be back for days, I couldn’t resist scanning the horizon for any sign of Uncle Roy’s little jon boat. All I saw was clear water and, once or twice, birds diving at hidden targets, making splashes but failing to come up with any fish.

We found a clearing near the river and Jodi showed me how to play Blind Man’s Bluff. He closed his eyes and spun around several times, then tried to tag me. I could move around within a small area we marked off with sticks but couldn’t go beyond that.

“Usually, you play this with a group,” Jodi told me after he caught me. “When you have a bunch of people, the ones who can see aren’t allowed to move at all. Since it’s just us, we had to change things.”

“Sounds a lot like, ‘Marco Polo,’” I said, covering my eyes. “But on land.”

“Well, if you want it to feel more like Marco Polo…”

I heard, then felt, the splash of river water. It was cold and felt good in the afternoon heat.

“You’ll pay for that!” I promised, chasing after my brother’s last known location, eyes still jammed shut.

Our parents were awake when we got back. At first, I was thrilled, ready to forget about the strangeness of the first day and night, to give our family vacation a restart. But I quickly realized that the weirdness was only beginning. For one thing, mom and dad weren’t acting groggy or hungover. They were both excited, bouncing around, talking and laughing and looking through the cabinets.

“Jodi, Jodi, Jodi, Jodi,” mom said after she realized we were back in the cabin. “Jodi, where did you put the rest of the beer?”

She was still slurring her words slightly.

“You guys drank all of the beer,” he said. “And ate most of the food.”

“Most!” Dad shouted, flicking the bust on the mantle, causing an oddly musical ding to echo out. “See, Rachel? I told you we only ate ‘most’ of the food. There’s still more.”

Mom was rummaging around the kitchen. “I’m starving. And thirsty. And starving. Are you sure there’s no more beer, Jodi?”

Jodi was pale. “I’m sure.”

“What about…what about wine? Is there more wine?”

“The wine,” dad joined in. “Did you say there’s more wine?”

Mom stopped searching the cabinets. “You said there’s more wine?”

Jodi shook his head. “No, I…I don’t know what’s wrong with you guys, but you’re scaring Cara and there is no more-”

“Wine!” Dad shouted, lifting up the bronze bust. “Rachel, darling, come have a drink.”

Mom half-waltzed, half-stumbled over to the fireplace.

“I’m telling you guys,” Jodi said, “you drank all of the wine last night.”

Dad up-ended the container and a black stream poured out into mom’s open mouth. She coughed and nearly choked but drank it greedily. After a moment, dad brought the bust to his lips and started lapping at it like a dog at a puddle. The dark wine spilled and splashed, staining their clothes and everything around them.

“How?” Jodi whispered.

I thought he was probably talking to himself but tried to answer.

“Maybe they didn’t finish it all last night?”

“They did.”

“Maybe they found more in the cabin?”

“That’s what I’m afraid of?”

“You’re afraid?”

Jodi turned to look at me. I’m sure he heard the fear in my own voice. He smiled.

“Just an expression, Cara-bear. Everything’s fine. Why don’t you go read in your room while I make dinner?”

Jodi and I ate alone in the small bedroom. We could hear mom and dad singing and laughing and bumping into furniture well into the night. The speaker must have died at some point because the music stopped but that only caused mom and dad to sing into the silence, loudly and poorly.

“They need to go to bed,” I said sometime around midnight.

“They will,” Jodi said.

He had brought pillows and blankets into my room and was laying on the floor next to my bed.

“I wish we were home,” I said, trying not to cry.

“We’ll be okay,” Jodi promised. “You’ll see. Tomorrow mom and dad will snap out of it, then Uncle Roy will be back, and we’ll be home soon.”

“Why are they acting like this? What’s wrong with them?”

Jodi was quiet for a long time.

“Hey,” he said, “why don’t we play a game until you fall asleep. Twenty questions? You remember how to play, right? You have to think of something.”

“Jodi…”

“First question: are you thinking of a person, place, or thing?”

I sighed but couldn’t help smiling a little. “Well, I’m definitely not a thing. I’m an animal.”

Jodi threw a pillow at me. “Don’t give me too much information if I don’t ask for it! You have to learn how to be sneaky, Cara.”

My brother wanted us to stay in the room all night but I insisted that we check on our parents about an hour after the cabin became silent.

“I’ll go, you wait here, okay?” Jodi instructed.

“Yeah right,” I said, following him as he stepped into the hall.

There was no sign of mom or dad in the living room. They’d left a mess, with bottles, cans, wrappers, and even furniture scattered everywhere. None of the lamps would turn on but the curtains were all open and we could see well from the flood of moonlight spilling in. I nearly slipped in something slick and sticky, grabbing Jodi’s shoulder for support. It was a dark puddle, like a black stain on the floor.

The cabin’s front door was open; our parents were standing out in the yard, staring up at the stars.

“Mom! Dad!” Jodi called from the doorway. “What’s going on?”

Neither of them responded. Dad’s left arm was twitching, jerking spasms that shot up from his hands to his shoulder every few seconds.

“Dad?” Jodi asked. “Are you okay?”

A small shadow darted across the clearing, running right between mom and dad. Mom fell on the silhouette, moving so fast she seemed to blur. When she stood up, she was holding a squirming rabbit by the scruff of its neck.

“Mom, what are you-”

Before Jodi could finish, mom lifted the rabbit to her face and bit down hard enough that we heard the crunch of bone all the way from the cabin. She tore into the animal while dad stood next to her, still twitching but otherwise motionless.

“Jesus Christ,” Jodi whispered. He turned to me. “Get back inside.”

“What is happening? What is mom doing to that bunny?”

Jodi tried to gently push me back. “Just go inside and go back to the bedroom. I am going to try to talk to-”

Mom and dad both snapped their heads to face us at the same time. Mom dropped what was left of the rabbit and crouched.

“Bedroom,” Jodi said, shoving me behind him.

Mom and dad ran toward us. Dad was stiff and stumbling but shockingly fast. Mom was still crouched low; after a few steps, she began running using her arms and legs like an animal. Jodi slammed and locked the cabin door a moment before our parents made it to the porch. They pounded and kicked and scratched at the door but never said a word.

“Stop,” I whispered, backing away. “Stop. Stop. Make them stop. Please make them stop.”

Jodi looked at me, his eyes wide, his face pale with shock. When he noticed how terrified he was, I saw my brother force a calm, small smile.

“It’s okay, Cara, mom and dad are just drunk. They’re…they’re playing a game.”

“Make them stop,” I sobbed. “Something’s wrong.”

“Easy, easy, everything will be alright,” he said, pulling me into a hug. “You’ll see. We’ll be home soon and this will all feel like a nightmare.”

The banging at the door continued as Jodi half-led, half-carried me to the bedroom. That night, I dreamed of melting faces again, faces with red mouths flecked with clumps of fur and meat.

We found mom and dad sleeping outside the next morning. The day was overcast and drizzling. Our parents were passed out under a tree near the front door, their clothes stained and torn. The cabin was a nightmare; they’d eaten the rest of the food and then torn the place apart. Trash was all over the floor, the couch was flipped over, and more black stains were spread across the walls. These looked fresh and were wet, even sticky. A few were still dripping.

I waited in the doorway while Jodi walked outside to check on mom and dad. He touched two fingers to mom’s neck, then dad’s, almost falling backwards when dad let out a loud snore.

“Are they okay?” I called out.

“They’re just sleeping,” Jodi replied, walking back to the cabin.

“We can’t just leave them out there.”

“Why not?” Jodi snapped. “They’re acting wild. Maybe they should be in the woods.”

I started crying and Jodi’s face fell. He wrapped me up in a hug.

“I’m sorry, Cara. I’m just worried about them. Maybe there was something bad in the wine.”

“I want to go home,” I sobbed. “Mom and dad need to take us home.”

“We’ll be home soon,” Jodi said, hugging me closer. “I’m going to call Uncle Roy. Hopefully, he’ll have cell reception out on the river. We just need to find the satellite phone…”

Finding the phone was easy. It was smashed into bits in front of the fireplace. The bronze bust lay next to the pieces.

“Why?” Jodi asked but I knew he wasn’t asking me. “Why would they break it?”

“Maybe it was an accident?” I said.

He didn’t reply; he was staring at the wine container.

“Jodi? Jodi, what’s wrong?”

“Look,” he said.

I did. I let out a small scream.

The face on the bust was different from the day before. It was the same beautiful, bearded man but his expression had changed. His grin was wider, a lunatic smile. His eyes had gone from cold indifference to hateful. And they were no longer looking straight ahead. Instead, the bust’s eyes were clearly, unmistakably locked on my brother.

“Look at the mess you’ve made.”

Jodi and I both jumped at the sound of mom’s voice. She and dad were leaning against each other in the doorway. The wine stains had spread from their teeth and lips and now covered their cheeks and hands. They were covered in scrapes and cuts from sleeping in the woods. Some of the wounds were still bleeding, only the blood was too dark. It looked black.

Dad’s eyes rolled back-and-forth over the room. “Have you kids been having a party without us? Little shits.”

“Little shits,” mom agreed. “And they’ve spilled the wine.”

Jodi stepped in front of me. “What happened to the phone?”

“The wine?” dad moaned, ignoring him. “Is it gone? Rachel, where’s the wine.”

Mom came towards us, unsteady but fast. Jodi barely had time to push us both back before she was next to the fireplace. There was something wrong with mom’s arms and legs; they looked thinner than usual despite our parents gorging on all of the food in the cabin. Her neck also seemed narrow and just a touch too long.

She raised the wine container and shook it violently, smiling when a loud sloshing filled the room. Dad laughed, an ugly, barking sound, then joined mom by the fireplace. They both drank the foul, black wine, spilling it all over each other, choking on it while making wet, gurgling sounds. When it finally appeared empty, they dropped to the ground and began licking at the puddles of it they’d left on the floorboards.

“Go into your room,” Jodi whispered.

“But mom and dad-”

“Go,” Jodi hissed, backing away while keeping himself between me and our parents.

They didn’t react, they just kept licking even after the floor was dry and all they got was dirt and splinters. Jodi locked the door once we were in the bedroom, then he pushed the bed against it.

“Jodi,” I whimpered. “What’s wrong with them?”

“I don’t know, Cara-bear. I don’t know. But Uncle Roy should be back tomorrow. He’ll know what to do.”

“I want to go home.”

“We will. Soon.”
