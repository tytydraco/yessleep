I’ve gone over the scene in my head so many times it feels like a scratch on an old record.

Every detail. Every moment leading up to the point where everything went sideways. Nothing about it adds up. Axel had never acted like that before. Not once in the four years we’ve been partners. He’s always been disciplined, reliable, and so damn sharp. That’s what makes this harder to swallow.

I’m sitting in my squad car, parked just outside St. Mary’s Church, watching the leaves swirl around in the cool autumn breeze. Axel’s in the back, sitting as calm and alert as ever, his eyes tracking the occasional passerby. His posture is perfect, his ears perked, ready for whatever I might tell him to do. Just like always. And yet, I can’t stop thinking about how he flipped, how he went from my loyal partner to a killer in the span of a heartbeat.

I haven’t told anyone about my doubts. Hell, how could I? No one would believe me. They’ve already closed the case, ruled it a tragic accident. “Axel’s instincts kicked in,” the department said. “He sensed a threat.”

But I was there. I saw it happen. There was no threat.

Father O'Brien had been under investigation for months. Whispers had trickled in about something not being right at the church. Allegations. Nothing solid, but enough to make Internal Affairs sit up and take notice. It wasn’t just the whispers about O'Brien. It was also the way some officers talked about him, like he was untouchable. It made IA take notice. It was my job to check it out, just routine stuff. Go in, ask a few questions, clear the air. Maybe Father O'Brien would lawyer up, maybe not. It didn’t really matter. I wasn’t expecting fireworks. Just another day on the job.

Axel and I arrived at the rectory early that morning. The air was crisp, the kind of autumn morning where you can see your breath and the cold snaps against your face. Father O'Brien was waiting for us by the front steps, the picture of calm, dressed in his black cassock with the white collar peeking out, a soft smile on his face. His hands were folded neatly in front of him.

“Officer Hart,” he said warmly. “And this must be Axel.”

I nodded, gave Axel a quick pat on the head. “Just here to ask a few questions, Father. Nothing serious.”

“Of course,” he replied, gesturing toward the door. “Please, come in.”

We stepped into the rectory, and I could smell the incense from the morning mass still lingering in the air. The place was quiet, peaceful even. If I hadn’t known better, I’d have thought I was interrupting a moment of prayer. Father O'Brien led us to his office, offered me a seat. Axel sat obediently beside me, calm as ever.

I got straight to the point. Asked him about the allegations, the rumors. His demeanor didn’t change. He denied everything, calmly and politely. There wasn’t even a flicker of nervousness in his eyes. Just that same placid smile, as if I’d asked him about the weather.

And then, out of nowhere, Axel growled.

I froze, mid-sentence. Axel never growls unless something’s wrong. But I didn’t see anything. No sudden movements, no tension in Father O'Brien’s body language. Just that same damn smile.

“Axel,” I said, my voice low, a warning tone I’ve used a hundred times. “Easy, boy.”

He didn’t stop. His growl deepened, a low rumble that sent a chill down my spine. I glanced at Father O'Brien, expecting some reaction. Fear, confusion. But he just sat there, watching Axel with those calm, almost too-serene eyes.

Before I could say another word, Axel lunged.

I felt an icy stab of fear. My heart lurched as I realized I might be next. My hand flew to my gun, fingers wrapping around the grip, but I hesitated. It happened so fast. One moment, Axel was sitting at my feet; the next, he was on Father O'Brien, teeth bared, sinking into the man’s throat. The sound. God, the sound. That wet, horrible gurgle as blood sprayed across the polished wood desk. O'Brien's arms flailed, but it was over in seconds.

“Axel, stop! Heel!” I shouted, but Axel wouldn’t listen. His eyes were wild, and for a terrifying moment, I thought I might have to pull the trigger. He wasn’t my partner in that moment. He was a beast, a possessed predator, completely overtaken by some primal instinct I had never seen in him before.

My hand went to my sidearm, my fingers wrapping around the grip as panic surged through me. My heart hammered in my chest, a single thought blazing through my mind.

*I’m next.*

I drew my gun, pointing it at Axel, my breath coming in ragged gasps. I didn’t want to do it. God, I didn’t want to. But I had to protect myself.

I pulled at his collar, yanked hard enough to nearly choke him, and finally, finally, he let go. I kept my gun drawn, my hands shaking, ready for anything. Father O'Brien slumped back in his chair, eyes wide open, blood pooling under his chin. His mouth moved, but no sound came out. He died with that same placid expression on his face, almost like he’d expected it.

I stood there in shock, panting, staring at the body, my hands shaking. Axel sat back on his haunches, his snout smeared with blood, but his eyes. They were calm. Like nothing had happened. He looked at me, wagging his tail, waiting for his next command.

It was like a nightmare, one of those slow-motion dreams where you can’t move, can’t think. The rest of it is a blur. Calling it in, the medics arriving, the looks from my fellow officers, the questions, the reports. All I could think was Why? Why had Axel done it? He’d never attacked anyone unprovoked. He was trained, disciplined. He knew better.

They ruled it a freak accident. “Axel sensed something we didn’t,” they said. “Maybe Father O'Brien was about to attack.” But I’d been looking right at Father O'Brien the whole time. He didn’t move. There was no threat. Nothing.

Now, sitting here in the squad car, I watch Axel in the rearview mirror. He’s still as calm as ever, his ears twitching slightly in the breeze. Like nothing’s changed. But everything has. I don’t trust him now, and I hate myself for it.

I’ve been trying to make sense of what happened. Thinking maybe there was something wrong with O'Brien, something off that only Axel could detect. Dogs can sense things we can’t, after all. But I didn’t see any signs, any flickers of danger. Just that eerie calm.

There’s a part of me that wonders if Axel knew something I didn’t. If O'Brien wasn’t as innocent as he seemed. Maybe the rumors were true. Maybe there was something darker lurking beneath that calm exterior. I’d heard the whispers.

Maybe Father O'Brien had friends in high places, people who made sure things never stuck to him. But none of that changes the fact that Axel killed a man. Unprovoked, uncalled for.

And now, every time I look at him, I feel that doubt creeping in. The trust we had is cracked, and I don’t know if it’ll ever be whole again.

Axel shifts in the backseat, turning his head toward me. His eyes meet mine in the rearview mirror, and for a brief moment, I see a flash of something. Something I can’t quite place. But it’s gone as quickly as it appeared, replaced by that familiar, loyal gaze.

“Good boy,” I mutter, though the words feel hollow. Because for the first time in four years, I’m not sure if I believe them.
