I wake up.

Or maybe I never really slept.

I just know I’m here.



It’s dark, but not in the room.

It’s in my brain, in my body.

Like someone poured cement into my thoughts.



There’s a smell. Familiar. Sharp.

Alcohol. Tape. Plastic.

The sting of antiseptic.

The faint rubber of oxygen tubing resting in my nostrils.



Hospital.

The word surfaces, but nothing else comes with it.

I can’t remember exactly why, but my instincts tell me it’s important.

I’m here for a reason.

Something serious.

Something I shouldn’t forget.



I try to sit up.

That’s when I realize something is wrong.

I can’t breathe.



My mouth is sealed shut.

My lungs won’t work.

Something is in my throat. Thick. Cold. Alive.



I reach up, fingers brushing plastic. A tube.

It’s inside me.

I tug, just a little.



There’s no pain.

Just pressure.

And that somehow makes it worse.



Because if I can’t feel this, what else can’t I feel?



My body kicks into panic.

My chest locks up, my vision swims.

Why can’t I breathe?



I try again, harder.

Still nothing.

Panic explodes.

I lose it, flailing desperately in an attempt to more forcefully rip out this invisible tube.



And then, I’m pinned down.

Not by hands.

Not by people I can see.

Just a force.

Sudden. Immovable.

Like the room itself collapsed onto me.



I can’t move.

I can’t scream.

The tube chokes the sound right out of me.

I thrash, but I’m trapped in my own skin.



I’m dying.



There are no faces. No voices. No comfort.

Just that unbearable now.

Like death arrived but forgot to finish the job.



And then, a stab in my arm.

Cold spreads through me.

My limbs weaken.

My mind fogs.

My ears ring.

The panic fades.

And everything goes black.



When I came to again, really came to, I didn’t remember any of it.

Not the panic.

Not the tube.

Not being awake.



Just a vague sense of hospital.

And bruises.

Deep, dark bruises on my arms and thighs.



No one said anything.

And I didn’t ask.



Weeks passed.

That’s when the nightmares started.

Always the same.

Waking up, unable to move, choking, pinned by something I couldn’t see.

Over and over.



I didn’t think it was real.

How could it be?

It felt like a dream, a hallucination.



At least a month later, I finally told my parents.

And that’s when it all clicked.



They told me the story.

Piece by piece.

And as they spoke, the fog lifted.



I had undergone a liver transplant.

Major surgery.

I knew that much.

I remembered it all when I came to.

I was born with liver illness.

We knew this was coming.

This was a lifetime in the making.



They had cut through my abdominal wall, cracked me open, and replaced an organ.

Nine hours under anesthesia.

No one expected me to wake up, at least not that soon.



But I did.



I sat up.

Bolted upright.

I reached for the breathing tube in my throat.

I didn’t know where I was.

Didn’t know I was awake.

And I panicked.



My dad and my brother were there.

They saw it happen.

They had no choice.

They held me down, hard, while a nurse sedated me again.



They didn’t mean to hurt me.

But I was strong.

Terrified.

And I had no idea where I was or what was happening.



I don’t remember their faces.

I don’t remember the room.

I don’t even remember pain.



Just panic.

Suffocation.

The cold certainty that I was going to die.



The surgery saved my life.

But for months, all I had were bruises and nightmares.

I didn’t even know the event had really happened.



Not until that day, when they told me the truth.

The day they gave me the missing pieces to the puzzle.

And suddenly, everything made sense.



I’ve come to peace with it now.

I’ve fully moved on.

The nightmares are gone.

And I’ve reclaimed my body, my breath, my mind.



But the worst part about it all?

No matter how vivid the dreams,

No matter how many times I relived that moment,

No matter how much I tried to remember,

**I didn’t even know I was awake.**



True story. This happened to me after a liver transplant. The trauma lived in my body long before I understood what it was. Feel free to ask anything in the comments.
