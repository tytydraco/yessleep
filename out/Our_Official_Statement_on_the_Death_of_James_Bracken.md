"Two days ago I taunted a potential spirit in my house. It may have tried to reach out to me, and as a fear-provoked reaction, I said, "At least I'm alive! You can't hurt me, so come on in." 

I don't know why I said it, but as soon as I did I felt a strong pressure in my chest. Almost as if someone was trying to vacuum the air out of my lungs. 

I thought maybe I was sick, so I went to lay down. See, I've never been a real believer in paranormal things. I'm not denying the possibility, but I've always been a sceptic. Now though, I don't know. 

It's either possession or insanity, but I've always been well in control of my psyche. I have a near-genius IQ, and have always approached dilemmas with logic and reason, not with emotion. It would take a lot more than some emotional trauma to take me down. 

The next day, I got up to go to the bathroom, and all was normal. I actually felt great. I use the bathroom, wash my hands, look up into the mirror and see myself staring back at me, but I looked dead. The stare was as if I was looking into the eyes of a corpse. 

I went to the store to get a few things for the house. Every person I'd look at had that same look. Dead. Literal walking corpses all around me. Like their souls had been removed. I started to hear whispers all around me. It was the most overwhelming sensation I had ever experienced. I couldn't tell a word that they were saying, but it's like they were laughing at me. I screamed out for it to stop in the middle of the store. 

I opened my eyes and everyone was staring at me. They didn't look dead, they looked concerned. As if they were looking at someone on the brink of insanity. That's not me though. I'm not insane. It's the demon. 

I talked to my mother when I got home, and she suggested I go speak to a medium, a professional on the matter. So I did. I spoke with her for hours, and she came to the conclusion that I invited this demonic entity into my body with my taunt from days before. She suggested I got to a church to be cleansed of my evils. If that's what I have to do... 

I paid a local catholic church a visit. I let them know my situation, and the things I was hearing. The priest told me that he doesn't believe it's a demon, but instead a psychological disorder. Schizophrenia. Yeah right. I'm not like that. I'm mentally sound. I guess I'll deal with it myself if even the church thinks I'm crazy. 

I went back home, and heard my mother scream for help. I ran upstairs, and she was just lying down watching TV. The demon is destroying me. I decided to splash some water in my face to wake myself up a little. When I looked back into that mirror, my eyes were missing, leaving bloody craters with the words, "You're ours" carved into my forehead. 

I panicked and ran to tell my mother, but she wasn't in her room. It was 2pm on a Tuesday. She's at work. Then who was watching TV? 

Everywhere I look, I see a horrifying image. One of my friends, dead. Ripped apart animals. My family members being tortured. When I close my eyes, its face, or lack thereof haunts me. Almost as if it's teasing me. 

I will not sit and let this happen with no proof. I'm going down to the basement and setting up a camera to catch it. 

Camera is now set up, and I'm writing this down as I sit in front of it. If it wants me, it'll have of show itself. I hear the voices once again, and feel the pressure. We'll be seeing soon. I have my knife and gun here just in case it comes for me" 




OFFICAL STATEMENT FROM CASE DIRECTOR DETECTIVE MICHAEL LUMIS. 

"The above text was found in the victim's phone. His prescription for Zyprexa, a 2nd-generation antipsychotic had not been filled for 3 months. He had a schizophrenic episode, leading to him taking his own life. 

He believed that he was being haunted by a demon for days. Claiming to see and hear things that weren't there. He set up a camera to prove he wasn't crazy, and killed himself on video. 

We cannot show the video due to its graphic nature, but we can describe its contents." 

WARNING: THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS ARE GRAPHIC, AND MIGHT DISTURB READERS. CONTINUE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

"At about 15 minutes and 33 seconds, the victim lifts a knife with a smile on his face, and proceeds to carve words into his forehead, which when mirrored, read as "You're ours." 

About 2 and a half minutes after he finishes, he begins to dig his eyes out of his face, still smiling, with blood pouring everywhere. He struggles for about 3 minutes to remove them, but ultimately succeeds, leaving those same craters he discussed in his writing.

He seems to begin to cry at about 21 minutes in, still smiling. Then, only seconds later, he looks straight into the camera, says "I still see you" and shoots himself in the temple, killing himself instantly. 

We will be updating the public with new information as it becomes available. Until then, please treat the family, and those involved with the victim, should you know him, with respect during their time of grief."
