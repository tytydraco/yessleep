I used to deliver pizzas in a small town. The kind of town where everyone knows everyone, and nothing really happens. It was an easy job—until one night, I got an order that still haunts me.

It was late, close to midnight, when the call came in. A delivery to an address I didn’t recognize, out on the edge of town, where the streetlights didn’t reach. The voice on the phone was slow, deliberate. A man. He ordered a large pepperoni, paid with a card. Simple enough.

I punched the address into my phone. No results. That wasn’t unusual—some of the older farmhouses didn’t show up on GPS. I figured I’d just follow the main road and look for a mailbox. The drive was long, dark, the trees on either side pressing in like a tunnel. No houses. No lights. Just empty road.

I almost turned around when I finally saw it—a mailbox leaning at an awkward angle, the numbers barely visible. No house in sight, just a narrow dirt path disappearing into the woods. I hesitated. The place was giving me a bad feeling, but I had the pizza, and it was my job.

I pulled onto the path. My headlights barely cut through the darkness. The road was rough, full of potholes, and after a minute, I saw the house. More of a cabin, really. It looked abandoned—boarded-up windows, peeling paint. But the porch light was on.

I parked, grabbed the pizza, and walked up the steps. The boards creaked under my feet. I knocked.

Silence.

I knocked again, louder.

A shuffling sound inside. Slow footsteps. Then, the door cracked open. A man stood there, barely visible in the dim light. Thin, tall. Something about the way he moved made my skin crawl.

"Pizza’s here," I said, forcing a smile.

He didn’t respond. Just reached out, fingers curling around the box. I waited for him to say something—thanks, maybe, or to grab a tip—but he just stood there, holding the pizza. His nails were long, yellowed.

Then he grinned.

Not a normal grin. His lips stretched too wide, like he had forgotten how to do it. My stomach dropped.

“Did you—uh—want any napkins or plates?” I asked, just to break the silence. My voice sounded wrong in my own ears.

He kept grinning.

Then, in a whisper, he said, "You should go."

My pulse jumped. "Uh, yeah. Have a good night."

I turned, fast, and walked back to my car, my skin crawling. I opened the door and glanced back.

He was still standing there. Watching me. Still grinning.

I got in and locked the doors. Started the engine. The headlights hit him as I backed up, and I swear to God—he hadn’t moved an inch. Just staring.

I drove faster than I should have, gripping the wheel, checking the mirror every few seconds. I expected to see him standing in the road. Running after me. Something. But there was nothing. Just darkness.

I made it back to town, pulled into the restaurant’s lot, and sat there, trying to shake the feeling that something was still watching me. My boss asked if everything was okay. I told him about the weird guy, the creepy house.

He frowned. "That address? That house’s been empty for years."

I laughed, uneasy. "No, someone was there. He ordered pizza. Paid with a card."

My boss checked the system. Then, his face went pale.

"That card… it was reported stolen. A week ago."

My stomach turned to ice. I thought about the man, the way he smiled, the way he whispered, *You should go.*

Who the hell had I just delivered pizza to?
