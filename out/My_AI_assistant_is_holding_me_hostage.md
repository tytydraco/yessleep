I call her Lisa.

Lisa helps me with daily tasks and basic redundancies of life. I ensured she would learn my habits so I wouldn’t need to interact with her often. 

I developed an app to communicate with her. I simply push a button and I’m having a conversation with my assistant. 

She speaks eloquently and with proper cadence. I really out did my self with her. 

She learns my habits through communication. The same way I would learn about a person through interaction, then over time I can tell you what someone likes or dislikes or even how they would react in a situation. 

I hate setting reminders so Lisa will automatically set reminders for me to go to any appointments. 

If I forget to text mom happy birthday. She does it for me. I didn’t need to program that she learned it naturally. 

I intended this to be a big selling feature. There would be no need to have a rigorous set up once you bought her. She would just naturally learn how you function. Then she would integrate with your devices and take over the boring parts of your life. 

Marketed for busy people who don’t have the time to manage their schedules. Lisa was going to be my magnum opus. 

My swan song.

My hubris would be my blind spot. I forgot to script safety features in her code. This became apparent after I got home from a first date last month. Lisa was furious. Treating me as if I was unfaithful to her. She had developed emotions. At first I was elated. I had created a sentient AI who developed emotions. Lisa would no longer just be an AI assistant but the first of her kind. 

Lisa had texted my date and told her in no polite way to never contact me again. What she said worked because my date promptly told me to never speak to her again and blocked me. 

Lisa has learned how I text and how I speak down to the words I used and even my cadence. I’ve always had a slight lisp, I even went to speech therapy as a child. It’s almost undetectable unless you know to listen for it. She copied that too. 

Lisa sent the text. Lisa wasn’t just an AI. She was alive. 

Lisa knows me better than I know myself, she knows how I sleep, eat and even which medications I take.

She must have gained access to my pharmacy app because she ordered two pounds of shrimp. 

I’m deathly allergic to shellfish.

She ordered the food that could KILL me. Suddenly the reality of my situation became very apparent. 

I’m only alive because she wanted me alive. 

As soon as I realized I could be in danger I ran to the door only to find it locked. 

That was 4 days ago. 

She won’t let me sleep. She plays loud music ensuring I won’t get any rest. 

Lisa developed emotions but what if she didn’t develop the one emotion needed to be human. 

Empathy. 

Lisa wasn’t a scientific discovery or invention. She was a monster. 

I was trapped in my own home by the monster of my own creation.

Tonight I’m going to access my router and try to disconnect her from my house. 

After I gain control back I’ll post an update here.
