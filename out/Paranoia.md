my name is Jasper, I'm posting this here, mostly because I will be considered mad anywhere else

 I want to set the scene exactly like it was for me yesterday, so i will probably go into what may seem unnecessary detail. Anyway, I live in the suburbs of South Carolina, near the coast, and I am a student at a school with a late release, and I'm so scared.

have you ever been somewhere, and just feel like something's off? like maybe your street feels a bit too empty, you aren't sure why. well I felt that when i left my bus, but it soon passed.

so I continued along my merry way up the street, just going through my routine thoughts, like what music I'd listen to when I get home, and as i got home I got a bit let down, because my dad got home already, and i don't like singing in front of other people. So a tad miffed i went into the garage, to see the door to the house was open.it shouldn't be open, it's winter and my dad is a freak about keeping the temperature right, so just feeling kinda weird i went inside, thinking i'd talk to him about it, oh boy.

sorry if my recollection quality goes down from here, i don't remember much, it was, well, hard from here. i closed the door behind me, and in typical fashion, i shouted "good morning!" or something like that. there was no response. I found it odd. 

Then I smelled something foreign to the household, something weirdly metallic. I had a single thought, what is going on? and as i turned around my question was answered within seconds, i saw red liquid seeping in the carpet.

 oh god. 

I walked over, the wound was clean and fresh, he completely lost his head. i was horrified, and called the cops, they said that they would be there soon, and then immediately, being the dumbo i was immediately told my group chat, instead of, i don't know, telling anyone else who actually knew him. 

i think the reason i never contacted mom is i was scared, i don't know why, i just couldn't bring myself to tell her. 

anyway the cops arrived and inspected the body, they had no explanation other than possibly me, I'm wondering if they may be right, even though they can't be I know so, I wasn't there

At this point i just wanted to put headphones on and find some way to sleep, even though it was like, 5 pm, but eventually mom came home, maybe 30 minutes later, i was sitting on the couch, watching the cops do their thing with the crime scene, she cried, my sister with her did too, i just sat there. How did I just sit there? I feel really bad about just, not being there..

Later me and Liz, my sister, talked. I told her generally what I've told all y'all so far. She said something about dad. I tried a joke. it fell flat. We hugged for what may have been the first and longest time in a while. After that I think I just went to my room and hid until the night crept in. i drew my feelings out on a large sheet of paper, honestly it's been the worst of many I've made throughout the past months, the only way i could deal with it.

This morning I felt it again, the feeling hasn't gone away, none of my remaining family feels it, it may just be my paranoia, but I feel something out there. Or it may just I've read too many of these to feel like this.
