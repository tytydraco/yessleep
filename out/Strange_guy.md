I really don't know how to start but a while ago I saw a weird dude walking around the streets here like everyday for hours he just walked around looking weird, he looks like between 20-30 got no hair, skinny and always looks like he's gonna murder someone. Normally I don't panic like that but this guy gives me a really bad feeling I can't even describe it, whenever he looked at me my blood been frozen like never before like I really just want to call the police and tell them it's a fcking murder, you literally can see it in faces and eyes but they would think I'm crazy for sure and you just can't say someone is a murder without any evidence.

I'm living in the third floor in a really peaceful and quite area in town and now it came out he recently moved in here in the first floor. Since then i always heard weird sounds from outside like someone hitting trees with something in the middle of the night and stuff. I asked a friend to stay one night because im scared as fuck all the time and in this night we heard this again and decided to go out with flashlights and we saw this guy hitting trees with like an old pipe or something. He saw us, stopped and just watched at us with like zero movement, i scared the fck out there running inside and still can't find any reason why would someone do this at night?

1 week later I came from work at midnight and I always smoke a cig when I come home from work. So at this night I came home put my bag in and walked out to smoke that cig when I saw that guy in a dark corner standing next to a tree in a t shirt when it was super cold outside digging something in or out of the ground there with his hands. I was shock frozen and never been that close to him and he stared at me while just standing there in the dark. I asked is everything ok? He said now everything is ok in a really weird voice. In that moment i threw away the cig and tried to come in that fcking door as fast as possible.

That was yesterday and I really don't know what to do? Im scared to come home now from work I already thought about changing work to a day shift because of that. What problems could this guy have that hes doing what he's doing there? What can I do? I already told my friend this but he's just joking about that saying he's on drugs and stuff but I never had a bad feeling like that before and I know how people look on drugs this must be something else i don't know i don't feel safe anymore here. 

I just need some serious advice at this point the people I told this are joking about this because they don't live here having this problem or don't understand that this is serious i don't know. Should I try to talk to this guy ? Should I try to avoid that and maybe tell the police what's going on there at night ? Should I wait to see what he is doing next ?

Maybe I'm overreacting this whole thing but as i said I never felt that weird bad feeling before and I really need some calming words or explanations of what this guy could have there or if I should do something right now
