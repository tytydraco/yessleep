I drive for a living. Not a fun, scenic job, but logistics—small parts deliveries between three state hubs. My old, built-in GPS finally choked a few months ago, and since the company wouldn't spring for a new one, I hit up a garage sale and scored a brick-sized Magellan unit for twenty bucks. It looked ancient, heavy, almost military-grade, but it turned on.

That’s when the weirdness started.

The first time I plugged it in, I laughed. The screen was a sickly green and black, and when I entered my first destination (Hub B, a familiar run), the map that populated was completely blank. No roads, no highways, not even an outline of a city. Just a featureless black expanse with a single, pulsing blue line—my current position—and a static red ‘X’ far off in the distance.

I figured the map data was corrupt. But then the voice—a calm, almost serene female voice with a slight European lilt—said, “*Begin primary traversal.*”

I ignored it and drove the route I knew. The blue line moved exactly as I drove, but it was charting its own course, running perfectly parallel to the Interstate, yet never *on* it. It was tracking a phantom road only it could see.

About an hour into the drive, the voice cut in again.

“*Rerouting. Immediate deviation required.*”

The blue line suddenly curved sharply left, cutting through a forest and what I knew was a deep ravine.

“Look, lady,” I muttered, checking the rearview mirror. “That’s a swamp, not an exit.”

I kept driving straight. The voice repeated, “*Deviation detected. Recalculating route to minimize spatial anomaly.*”

I thought, *spatial anomaly?* That was a new one.

It kept happening. Every day, the map would update. The Phantom Route, as I started calling it, never followed paved roads. Sometimes, it would tell me to "Proceed across the municipal absence," or "Turn right onto the forgotten axis." One time, it routed me through the middle of a major lake.

I decided to run a test. I pulled over onto a deserted dirt track, parked the truck, and took the GPS unit out. I stood in a field and typed in a random waypoint about a mile away.

The screen lit up. The static red X appeared. The voice whispered, “*Path identified. Distance to nexus: 5,280 feet.*”

Then, the instructions began, and they made my heart actually seize up.

“*Proceed through the dense memory of the oak tree.*” (I was standing next to a very old oak.) “*At the juncture of breath and silence, turn sharply north.*” “*Maintain velocity across the shadow of the unseen barrier.*”

It was describing metaphysical things. It wasn’t mapping roads—it was mapping concepts, distances between things that *aren't supposed to be measurable.*

I quickly drove back to the highway, terrified. I resolved to throw the thing away, but every time I reached for the power cord, a wave of sickening dizziness would hit me, accompanied by an intense, cold fear of being utterly and permanently lost. I needed it, somehow. It was the only thing that saw the *real* path.

The worst night was last week. I had a late delivery, and I was driving through the isolated stretches of the state forest. It was pitch black, rainy, and my real route was clear—Highway 141.

The GPS screen, however, was glowing ominously. The blue line was leading me off the road, onto a path labeled simply: **\[UNBOUNDED SEPARATION\]**.

The voice was no longer serene. It had an edge of demanding urgency.

“*Turn now. The threshold is here.*”

I gripped the wheel. “No. This is where I go, this is 141.”

“*The road is a lie of shared reality. You are required to exit the consensus.*”

I glanced at the screen, and I swear the red 'X' wasn't static anymore. It seemed to be pulsing *faster*, and I had a sudden, overwhelming vision: a place that wasn't a forest, but a vast, silent, gray field where the sky and ground met seamlessly, and in the distance, a massive, unblinking eye—the red 'X'—watching me.

I slammed on the brakes. The voice screamed, electronically distorted: “*COORDINATES ARE NOW COLLAPSING! DRIVE!*”

The blue line on the screen didn't move; it just stretched, elongating the path into the forest until it looked like a gaping black wound.

I ripped the unit out of the dash. The dizziness hit me like a physical punch, and I had to gasp for air. I tossed the GPS onto the passenger seat and floored the accelerator, driving blind, speeding down 141 until I hit the lights of a truck stop.

I'm parked now. I threw the GPS into a dumpster behind the gas station, locked the doors, and I’m staring at my own phone for navigation.

But here’s the thing that won’t let me sleep:

When I turned on my phone’s map, the standard Google Satellite view popped up. And running perfectly parallel to Highway 141, visible only in the black, vacant screen of my phone, was a faint, shimmering, *perfectly straight* line.

It wasn't blue, and it wasn't red. It was a pale, sickening green.

It’s following me. I think the Phantom Route isn't in the device anymore. I think it's branded onto the road—or maybe branded onto my vision—and now every path I drive will have two directions.

And the green line is getting brighter.
