In the past few days, something about my fiancée has changed. Subtly, almost imperceptibly... but constantly.

It was Arthur, my best friend and a history student at college, who translated the phrase engraved on the back of the contract. We thought it was Russian at first, but he called me in the middle of the night — his voice hesitant, tense, like he was afraid to say it out loud.

“Man... I managed to translate it. The phrase... it’s Greek, not Russian.”

He paused. A long pause. He seemed to weigh every word, as if they held some kind of power.

“Δέχομαι να γίνω η θυσία σου...” he said slowly — the pronunciation, he guessed, was something like: “DÉ-ho-me na YÍ-no i thi-SÍ-a su.”

He swallowed hard.

“It means... ‘I accept to become your sacrifice.’”

I was silent. It sounded more like a sealed promise than just a phrase in a contract.

“There’s something else,” he continued. “Below the phrase, there’s a symbol. It’s Greek, yes, but not common. I’ve never seen it before.”

Another silence. Arthur rarely lost words.

“Maybe it’s something older. Pre-classical, perhaps. A cult symbol... or something worse. I...,” he hesitated, “David, just be careful what you say out loud. Some things we accept without meaning to. And don’t even realize.”

Even without fully understanding what it meant, a chill ran down my spine.

I had already signed. And she... she had already changed.

Since then, I started paying more attention to her.

By day, she seems... gentler. She looks at me like she sees something sacred in me. Her touch is light, almost reverent. She smiles often, but it’s a different kind of smile. There’s a sweetness that wasn’t there before — but it’s not really hers. It’s like she’s playing a role.

She talks about flowers. About seeds. Talks about spring like it’s a personal season. And every time she touches something alive, she seems... more alive too.

But at night, everything changes.

There’s no tenderness. Only a restless intensity. She wakes silently, walks through the house as if guided by something. She talks to herself — or to someone only she can see.

Yesterday, I saw her standing in front of the mirror, wearing a strange outfit — a dress with layers of light fabric, like those on ancient Greek statues. She didn’t move. Didn’t blink. She just whispered:

“It’s almost ready.”

She went back to her parents’ house this morning. My father-in-law looked at me strangely, as if searching for something in me. As she got into the car, he placed a firm hand on my shoulder and said without taking his eyes off my face:

“This is very important to us. Especially to my sweet... Per—”

He stopped. Took a deep breath. Forced a smile.

“...Dianna. We’ve confirmed the wedding date. It’s in three days. Be at my house the day before to get your suit ready. Sleep well. You’ll be photographed for the press.”

Even with her gone, I still feel watched. Like a shadow follows me. Like the very air knows something’s coming. And the fear of being alone... it started to take over me.

Earlier, I decided to go out. To a café in town. Before that, I took a shower. When I looked in the mirror, I noticed my skin was paler. And behind me — a shadow. Clear. Present.

But I didn’t scream.

The shadow spoke.

The voice... was more than deep. It was heavy, ancient, as if it came from the walls, the floor, my own chest. It echoed through the bathroom, filling every corner. Impossible to ignore.

“Your body will be mine, young man. There’s no reason to fear. Any attempt to resist is useless. I hope you get used to me.”

I stood there, frozen. The mirror seemed foggy, but there was no steam.

Later, I went to the café. I tried to act like nothing was wrong. While waiting for my coffee, I saw an elderly couple crossing the street. And then... dates came to me. Fragments. A sequence without context — days, months, years. They came like a dry whisper, deep in my mind. Along with a feeling hard to describe. Like the time around them... was wearing away.

The cup in my hands felt colder.

I went back home with my coffee hot and my chest cold.

Outside, it was cold. But inside... inside felt as cold as a moonless night.
