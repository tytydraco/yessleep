Love was always transient in my home. I was born among the wreckage, in an interstate motel room during a summer hot enough to boil blood. As far back as I can remember, even before we moved to the country, my parents teetered halfway between love and utter contempt. 

Some months they’d find something new in each other. I’d find them intertwined, locked in a tight embrace. Most months, violence was embraced–worshipped like a saint in our household. Glass shattered, punches landed, doors locked, and their relationship returned to how it usually was. 

But come rain or shine, come bliss or bedlam, I was never embraced. I’d always cover my eyes and ears, letting the darkness envelop me, wishing only to love and be loved in return. 

I was fourteen when I fell in love for the first time. Summer had just come around. The mercury bubbled in the glass, taking tempers with it. I ran out the screen door to the river, slipping on smooth rocks underfoot. And it was on that muddy bank that I saw her. Her carefree grin and tilted head. Her pristine Catholic school uniform. Her eyes caught the sunlight, flashing an almost imperceptible spark. Finally, I stopped staring. 

“Hi, I’m Jamie,” I whispered. 

“I’m Donna,” she said. She had a voice like honey, and it made me feel like the luckiest girl in the world. “Nice to meet you.”

And when my world was thrown into Technicolor, all the black-and-white romance movies suddenly made sense. I discovered a person just below the skin that I didn’t hate. Each day no longer escaped me. Although our time together was short, those quiet moments before dawn felt eternal–when the stars glowed watchfully overhead and the scents of life filled our minds. Away from sleepless nights and raw hatred, I uncovered my dreams and secrets as the earth swelled cold and comforting beneath. All my secrets but one. I knew she didn't love me in the same way. How could she? 

But hell, I tried. I dug out a space underneath the porch and built my love shrine. My nails scrawled her name across the dead wood. A road of candles lit the way in. I prayed in the black with a dog-eared romance novel clutched close to my chest like a rosary. I hummed that sweet song from my mother’s CD player, the one about moonlit churchyards and murdered sweethearts. Lacquered with sweat and cobwebs, I once again wished to be loved. And as the last days of summer slipped away, I decided to confess. 

And like all things in my life, it failed. She just got colder; I don’t know what I expected. We drifted apart, and I never saw her again. But I never forgot. 

I thought I’d never love again.

I was twenty-five when I fell in love for the second time. I remember staring across the hall, fixating on him amidst the sea of pale hospital robes and multicolored wristbands. I remember the day I confessed my feelings for Roger Hopkins. We stood motionless in the empty parking lot. The sun burned orange in the sky behind.

“–and, um, I think you’re amazing,” I slurred, “and handsome, and so, so talented, and yeah, I’d really love to get to know you better. And, um, maybe even take you out to dinner tonight. What do you think about that?” He smiled back at me, his smile bared white and pearly. 

“I’d like that very much.”

“So you–” I pushed the word love from my mind–“like me too?” I asked in disbelief.

“Of course!” he laughed, and I believed him. 

“You know, I’ve never invited someone to my house for a first date,” I admitted. Sunbleached barns and rolling fields flew by outside as we drove through the country dusk. “I’ve never actually been on a date.” I thumbed the radio dial to a news station. Yet another brutal slaying in East Texas, said a harrowed voice through the static. It appears to share similarities with two unsolved murders committed these past few months. Diana Foreman, age 23. Judith Esther, age 29. 

“Good god,” I whispered. The crime occurred after the perpetrator entered her home–

“Let’s not listen to that,” said Roger as he turned the dial up a notch. The sickening words quickly softened into the twang of acoustic guitar.

“Thank you,” I whispered, and he rested his hand on mine. I rolled down all four windows and the sunroof. The music washed over the valley, filling our sky. Well, I came home like a stone and I fell heavy into your arms…I sang along poorly, loud as a hurricane. Roger matched every word. The pedal felt weightless beneath my boot.

I was in love.

He stayed the night on a spare mattress and when I asked him to move in with me, he did it without one complaint. Coming home from exhausting days at work, my feet would fly down the stairs. We’d talk about everything. When our conversations stretched into the night, I loved to lean on him, feeling his heart thumping in devotion to me. He’d never interrupt me. After we’d finally go to sleep, I’d watch the glow of dawn bloom out the window above his bed. All was well in the world. 

“What do you think about marriage?” I asked one night, curled up next to him and half-asleep. No answer. He snored, his face pale and upturned, and I let the question fizzle out in the candlelight. 

Softly, I drifted off to the unsteady rhythm of his breathing. The months marched to the frail, fading rhythm. One day, I was sitting there, staring down into his eyes when his chest seized. He bent double, a rough noise in his throat sputtering like a motor as he struggled to breathe.

“Are you okay?” I asked frantically, over and over again.

“Of course,” he whispered. “Don’t you ever worry about me.” And I believed him. 

That was the beginning of the end.

I believed him even as he faded before my very eyes. His quiet reassurances weakened over those next four days. I quit my job so I could stay by his side to treat him and make sure he was still breathing. But his retracted gasps came quickly, muddy and shallow as a riverbank, shorter and shorter. And that Sunday, half-past three, Roger coughed for the last time. Blood expelled out his lips, spraying a scarlet constellation against the plaster wall as I rushed over too late.

That day it was dark like the sun had been plucked from the sky like a lightbulb and smashed to pieces on the freezing earth. Pieces that’d never be picked up.

The house and I collapsed together. 

At night, I’d awaken, suffocated by darkness, rising once in a while to look out the window at the muddy driveway. I’d stare at a car I hadn’t driven in ages. Over it, stars floated alone through the black expanse. I’d feel his absence beside me as I bundled myself in sweat-soaked sheets. Dry rot metastasized across the staircase like cancer. It felt like my soul was burnt.

I faced day after day after day alone. And god, the dawn hours were the worst, when self-hatred tore my stomach open and insomnia shoved me into another meaningless morning. 

Meaning. The humidity seeped in. It crawled across the windowpane over my frail, vile body. How did one find meaning in this abyss? How did one look around at the world they inhabited and say this is representative of something greater? How had I done it before? How had I found it worthwhile to laugh, take a walk, get out of bed in the morning? 

Human connection. Love. I turned over on the mattress and spat against the cold wall. Agonizingly, my life dripped away like gutter leakage. This is how it feels to be an extension of nothing.

But maybe not all was lost. 

One night, drifting off to the pitter-patter of the rain, I left the radio on. From my place on the floor, I couldn’t move to change it. And when I woke up screaming, the voice of a familiar newscaster was there to soothe my aches. She had her fingernails removed. The Texas Torturer claimed his sixth victim this past Saturday. In her own home, no less. 

 

Boom. Lightning crashed outside, shooting me to my feet. Colleen McCannon–young and beautiful. She lit up every room she walked into. The town of Carraway, Texas struggles to deal with the news. Among the wreckage of the night, I watched the lightning reduce a tree to splinters. 

“HA!” I laughed. My voice felt thin, papery from disuse. I’d always hated that tree. I’ve always loved watching thunderstorms. I enjoy their chaos, but there’s something so beautiful about knowing the sky resets itself in the end. Knowing that suffering is merely a testing of faith. That daybreak blooms patiently beyond for those who wait.

And so I pushed death away to the little margins on the calendar. 

I was twenty-seven when I fell in love for the third time. 

The rain is supposed to continue for the next week, said the weatherman as I watched torrents ravage the bluebonnets. The worst storm to hit the South in ages– 

I clicked the remote. The only news story I cared about was The Torturer. 

It was the media frenzy of a generation. Television and the radio quickly became my best friends. For months, I followed the cold, crumbling trails. His composite sketch was weak at best, and I’d shiver every time it came onscreen, transfixed by the gray, angular lines. Fear and paranoia rolled like fog across state lines and radio frequencies. From his tenth victim, the killer once again stole a fingernail. 

It’s a tragedy in every sense of the word. We extend our hearts to Miss Susan Patrice. To her grieving loved ones, we give our sincerest thoughts and prayers. They talked about him in hushed tones which barely concealed an ocean of fascination. I was the same. In dreams, I found myself at intricately arranged crime scenes. Sometimes, I felt my life seep out around me onto the kitchen tiles. Other times, I held the knife. I just loved imagining myself present. His sins were stealthy and merciless, and I could sit there for hours soaking up every last word. 

But during one particularly violent night, I wondered: if this cigarette kills me now, if the Torturer walks through my door, who will find me?

 

My dead family? My nonexistent lover? I realized not one of my friends from the hospital ever even called me back. They were simply transient, as all things are. I began to sob, realizing no happy ending would dawn on me. The fog seemed inescapable, imprisoning. Josie Hampton, said the TV. A bright young girl: taken by an angel?

Surrounded by detritus and ashtrays, watching the broadcast detail another dead girl and all who loved her, I felt the outer dark washing in. In waves, it eroded my barricades which once held fast against the world. Lights blazing in the living room, death called to me through the mist like a siren. I decided I wouldn’t resist, wouldn’t eat until I died here. Maybe someday, decades after I died and the electric bills reached a critical mass, someone would discover my worthless life finished. 

All twenty-seven years–amounting to what? I was already dead to the world. I’d prayed and prayed for something to happen, and nothing ever had. I prepared to take the last step into oblivion. 

Ding.

Curiosity pulled me to the door. Through the windowpane, eyes met mine and I recoiled. I thought it was a mirage at first; who would be this far out in the country this late? A police officer? A spirit; coming to drag me over? An angel? His grin was like a warm fireplace in midwinter, turning embers in my chest.            A demon? He wore all black and stood absolutely still against the bone-chilling cold. Whoever he was, I opened the door. Anything to stave off the abyss.

"Come in!” I said. “Unless you want to stay out there?" A moment passed, and my stomach turned as a man in his mid-twenties entered, hands rigid in his pockets.

"Thanks, I was worried that—"

"I'd leave you out there?" I gasped.

"Yeah,” he said in an easy, low voice. “My car broke down, and I didn't have service and got lost. So I've been wandering, looking for hospitality." I winced. 

"Well, you’re lucky you found me. Come, sit down."

"I—"

"Please, I insist! It's just so good to see another face." 

The man resembled Roger, and if it didn't remind me of our first day here… 

"Thank you. What's your name?"

"Jamie,” I said.

“I’m Andrew. Nice to meet you."

"You said you were wandering?”

We sat on the couch and slipped into comfortable small talk, not to dispel the silence but to give it flavor. As we talked, Andrew’s eyes flicked past the TV, staring through the windowpane with a small smile. 

"–I love thunderstorms, honestly,” he said as I nodded gleefully. “The noise, water, electricity, all of it close to snapping–” Andrew bit his lip. “–it makes me feel powerful. Alive, for once. Like anything's possible." He breathed out at last. “That's how I live, I guess,” he finished, stretching his gloved hands to the sky.

"Is your last name Dufrense?" He caught the reference quickly.

"No,” he laughed. “I’m Andrew Louden. Sorry, I haven't escaped prison recently." He mimed removing his shirt and screaming to the heavens. “I love that movie!” 

“Me too. It always makes me cry,” I said, secretly wishing he'd actually taken his shirt off. Warmth flowed through me just as shivers rattled his body. 

"Oh, you poor thing!" I yelped. He removed his soaked jacket, revealing a backpack that he set down on the floor. I rushed off to get him a towel.

"Sorry," he said sheepishly. “I'm a mess." 

"You're fine! I should’ve gotten you one sooner." I examined his black plastic gloves. "Plus, this must be hard for someone like you."

"What–”

"You're a clean freak, just like me. Well, this house has seen better days, as have I. Ever since—" I stopped myself. Silence hung heavy between us as his face flashed courteous disinterest. "Where were you going in this weather?"

The TV told us that the girl from Abilene was dead for days before her boyfriend found her body. Elisabetta Roswell, age 27. No DNA evidence was found at the scene of the crime, though evidence suggests he stayed at the house for two or more days after he murdered her. The killer could be anywhere by now. We both stared, hypnotized. 

"St. Linton,” he said after a pause.

“You don't live there, do you?"

"No!”

"Good," I responded confidently. "I was worried you'd say yes, and I'd stop liking you.”

“You like me? I’m such a bore!”

“No, you’re not!”

"Well, I’m not usually this talkative.” He winked. “I don’t talk most days. My job…well, it’s soul-numbing, and I find little energy for anything else. I guess that's why I adventure out of my comfort zone sometimes." There was that faraway look again. "You know? A little adventure made me drive this way."

"Well, we're lucky it brought you to me,” I said. “Would you like some hot chocolate?”

“Sure!” said Andrew. I skipped to the counter.

Holding the chocolate mix, I froze, reminded of Roger and his love for salted caramel. His love for me. But I persevered through the hell behind my eyes, making myself focus on the microwave countdown, the desiccated grapefruits atop the counter, and the rows of air fresheners. Anything but the burning memory. 

Beep.

The timer reached zero, and I stirred in the mix while walking toward him, trying to make him feel at home. Maybe someday, this could be his home. I could hope; as Andy Dufresne says, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.

“It’ll be cool soon,” I promised. Andrew sat still, his expression frozen in rictus as a psychiatric expert stepped into the frame. He introduced himself as Dr. Morris. What does a serial killer want? he asked, spreading his arms like a reverend at the pulpit. He wants to covet. He wants to express his power and force others to bend to his will. The only way his broken brain understands is through bloodshed. Bestial violence. 

“Isn’t it interesting?” I asked.

“What?”

“He’s talking about the killer like he’s a monster. Deviant, abnormal, impossible to understand.” I sensed his eyes on me. “He might be, I don’t know him. But really, it’s all...relative.” A tender smile surfaced on his face. 

“Yeah?”

“They’re talking like the killer knows it’s wrong.”

“Maybe. In his eyes, it’s the other people who are deviants, abnormal—“ he paused, savoring his next words with a little breath like my mother after cigarettes—“impossible to understand.”

“Exactly!” I passed him the hot cocoa.

“Ooh, what’s in here?”

“Caramel, milk, and–” I winked– “something special.” Andrew clinked mugs with me and as he placed it to his lips, my abdomen seized in anticipation. “Well? What do you think?”

“I think it tastes lovely,” he said, swallowing a gulp. I breathed out a long sigh. “It tastes like home.” I blushed.

“Lookit! Dr. Morris is on again.”

Our attention switched back to the TV. It was a change in ritual, he said. And killers are all about ritual. The end result was still the same, he continued, fidgeting, but forensic evidence suggests the killer...acquainted himself with Miss DuBois. Andrew looked at me. They even ate before he tortured her for hours and—

“Weird, huh?”

“Yeah.” His absentminded voice dragged me to the past. Oh, you’re just like Roger. 

“Like who?” Dammit.

“My boyfriend,” I said. “We met as nursing students. He was perfect. But now—“ I choked, finally accepting it— “He’s dead, and I’m alone.” Silence reigned, and I did everything except look at my cocoa. When he also took a sudden interest in my cup, I remembered to check his. He’d drained it to the dregs. 

“I’m sorry,” he whispered. “Really.”

“Thanks,” I said, softly. “It gets easier. Believe me.”

“Why do you think he does it?” Andrew asked, abruptly.

“What?”

“The Torturer. You seem to understand him far more than that so-called expert.” We both laughed as Dr. Morris opened his mouth again. Murder. Murder is a violation of nature–an act driven by extreme narcissism at its deepest root.

“Nah-sacissism at its doy-pest root,” I mocked, Bostonian, and then we were giggling again. 

“Really, though,” he asked again, more serious. “What do you think?” I laid back against the couch, contemplating. 

“I think that he seeks understanding,” I said, slowly. “His life wasn’t like everyone else’s. I doubt he had a good childhood at all. But whatever happened to him wasn’t his fault. There’s something inside him that gives him this need. It’s been there forever. He can’t stop it.” I felt my cheeks reddening. “Sorry, I’ve never really told this to anyone–”

“Go on.”

“But it’s not that he’s a monster,” I continued. “He’s like everyone else, just with a different addiction. On the other hand, he likes it–he likes the power and the attention the addiction gives him. He wants to be feared, reviled, even loved. I mean, it worked. And there’s really no need or way to stop once you’ve started. Once you let yourself fall—what does it matter? You might as well just go faster and faster till–” I stopped myself. “I’m not making any sense, am I?”

“No, I get it,” Andrew said. “I understand completely.” An imperceptible look passed through his eyes as I lay back against the couch again. It held a thousand words, but I couldn’t read it.

“Could you point me to the restroom?” he asked politely.

“Sure. It’s in the basement,” I said, gesturing to the basement door. “First door to the left.” I watched him stride to the entrance without a care in the world. Quickly, he descended the stairs, each step creaking underfoot. The moment I heard him step on the bathroom tiles, I rose from the couch and quietly slipped the door bolt through its lock. 

I had to know more about this mysterious man. 

His backpack shone black on the floor. In an instant, I dropped down to my knees and unzipped the pockets in a feverish cold. I saw a half-eaten bag of trail mix, a phone, and a poncho. I dug deeper. A pocketknife? A power drill? A Polaroid? The photo was of a pale, familiar-looking woman with full, red lips. That was what I’d feared most. A girlfriend? A wife? My chest hurt from sadness. 

Underneath it, I saw another Polaroid and pulled it to the surface. Suddenly, I felt light-headed. I blinked again, but the image was still there. In this one, the same woman was covered head to toe in blood. Suddenly, I realized where I’d recognized her from. Diana Foreman, age 23. I dug up more Polaroids, more women. Judith Esther, age 29. Oh shit. Elisabetta Roswell, age 27. Oh shit.

A horrific scream, louder than thunder, echoed up from beneath the floorboards. Ten agonizing seconds later, I heard glass shatter directly below me. 

Oh shit. 

The butcher knife slid easily out the block on the kitchen counter. Holding it, I unlocked the basement door. I took the stairs four at a time, the wood slamming beneath my feet. Come on, come on…I thought. Stepping into the basement, my eyes quickly adjusted to the buzzing darkness.

Down here, I could find my way around perfectly. I sucked in a breath and followed the ornate path of candles past the bathroom. Its door remained open. 

Drip. Cold rain seeped through the rot onto my head, and I shivered. The knife felt weightless in my hand. I extended it out into the darkness, but I didn’t want to use it. Not unless I had to. 

Drip. Dull candlelight glinted off the blade’s edge. I rounded a corner too sharply. 

Bang. My shoulder hit the bookshelf. Weathered romance novels fell to the ornate, polished floor. It was a pity to disrupt consecrated ground, but forgivable. Where are you? I thought. 

Drip. I rounded another corner. 

As the path of candles ended, the mattress shrine bloomed out of the darkness before me, towering and glorious as a mountain. Dwarfed by its stained, obscene majesty and the innumerable little flames leaping out of the dark, I saw two horrid sights.

First, the basement’s egress window was broken. A piece of Andrew’s shirt had torn off and snagged on the shards when he’d escaped through. He’d escaped using the mattress to climb–oh, god. I tore my eyes away. 

Even after so long, glimpsing that second sight still made me choke. Decay scorching my nostrils to the bone, I looked at Roger’s corpse.

I let out a piercing sob.

I never wanted to be a killer. At fourteen, I’d been lucky enough to find Donna recently dead from slipping on the rocks. We had a few perfect days together, but then she began to fall apart. I prayed at the porch shrine, hoping she’d come alive again so our love would be mutual. But love cannot transcend death. 

When summer ended, I sent her downriver. That was when I decided no good thing ever dies.

So I studied the human brain to develop a procedure of my own. I perfected it well during long, long nights; when deathly hunger gnawed away deep inside my chest, keeping me reticent from the cruel and unforgiving world. It is, essentially, an icepick lobotomy that also induces full paralysis. I enter just beneath the eyelid. After I perform it, you can only eat, drink, breathe, urinate, defecate, and stare. It cripples nearly every non-essential muscle. You cannot speak. You cannot smile. You cannot move your limbs. You cannot scream. However, you can think just enough to feel love. 

If done correctly, it does not kill. 

I never wanted to be a killer. I only wanted the loneliness to be gone. All I wanted—all I’ve ever wanted was to love and be loved in return.

Freezing rain sprayed my face through the broken glass. I turned away from the egress window, towards Roger, his body resplendent and beautiful at the base of the shrine. 

Roger’s procedure was done incorrectly. It was a slow death of infection but I ignored it, speaking for him, telling myself he was healing. After he died, I grew hateful. Why didn’t he drink enough coffee that first dinner to knock him out? Why’d he fight and make me bruise his eye first? Why couldn’t he have been perfect? But time turned that hate into veneration. Painstakingly, I built a second love shrine down here and tried to resurrect him. What a shame Andrew had to see my failed attempt.

“Andrew,” I whispered.

But he was transient too. He’d escaped through the window, never to be seen again. I shook thinking of him stumbling up the driveway and fleeing into the night. I crumpled, staring into Roger’s bloodless sockets that once beheld such love. They pierced my soul, telling me of my failures. I thought of laying there forever, knowing at least the flies would have me as their beloved. 

But then, like an angel had whispered it to me, I thought of the thunderstorm. I thought about love, about how beautiful it was to know that the sky resets itself in the end. Daybreak blooms patiently beyond for those who wait. So I pulled myself up to peek through. Perhaps I was searching for a miracle; a shooting star to wish upon like all those nights before. And I found it. 

I saw my car sunken close to the earth; the tires flattened. And just beyond that, I saw Andrew’s dark silhouette on his knees. He crawled into the horizon, barely past the driveway, the sedative in his cocoa weighing down his limbs. A warm grin split my face. He was in the perfect condition for eternal love. 

For the last time, I wished upon that scarlet constellation. Then I climbed the wall.

Crawling through the shattered window, glass shards sliced crimson lattice-work on my legs, but I found it beautiful. Everything was beautiful now. Dawn’s birdsong graced my ears, and in it, I could almost hear lyrics, something about moonlit churchyards and murdered sweethearts. A light rain washed the blood off my body as I pulled myself onto the unkempt lawn towards Andrew. My pace quickened, each step lighter and lighter as I stumbled ahead into daybreak. I inhaled deeply, taking in the world and the scent of petrichor; a new dawn, a new day, a new life. 

Maybe this time, love would stay.
