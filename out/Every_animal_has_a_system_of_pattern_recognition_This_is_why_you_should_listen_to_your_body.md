I have always trusted my intuition, not in a superstitial way, I have never believed in the supernatural nor do i have a religion. I do believe tho that there are things in this world we are not meant to understand. I wish I didn't tried to overcome my intuition that day. But let's start from the beggining.

I consider myself as an adventurer, I have an YouTube channel that I use as a diary of my expeditions, it has a little over a hundred videos and some thousands of subscribers, sometimes I do livestreams too.

But this day was different, I wasn't on the right mood to talk with the camera so when I saw that there was an abandoned house near my hometown, I couldn't contain the excitement and didn't even thought about the channel. Apparently the owner was an elderly man with no family, they only found his body after a neighbor called the police saying that he hasn't been seen in the past 3 months. The entire house had to be quarantined, you could smell it from the other side of the road when they opened the door. It was my friend Max who told me about the house, he had the same hobby as me so we frequently exchanged information about new places to go. He said he never felt so unnerved looking at a house as he did with this one.

I packed my usual things — a lantern, a pocket knife, a lockpicking set, some ropes and a rusty revolver just in case — and hopped on my 96 camry that I've had since highschool. The ride to hometown was a little over 2 hours and was quite uneventful. When i finally reached the neighborhood I stopped on a café to prepare myself, I would've to wait more 3 hours before it was dark enough so that I could enter the house (yes, I was going to invade it). I waited tediously on my car sipping on my coffee as the time passed and when I decided that I should go, I picked my bag and rapidly lockpicked the back door. 

At first glance the house was just as any other one that I've seen. Always with the feeling that you're not alone, that you should go away. But I was accustomed with this, it was the same every time that I entered an abandoned house. There was some pictures hanging on the walls that showed a family with 3 children, if I had to guess it, I would say that the man was divorced and was left alone to rot in here.

It'll be easier to explain if I describe the house to you, it was ancient, it must've been passed by atleast 4 generations, the wood that made the walls was cracked and all the doors hinged in a way that made me shiver, the house had an attic filled with boxes, although none of them seemed to have anything.

The house was slightly wrong in some way, the police had cleaned it but they left everything at place, the walls of the bedroom were scribbled from the ceiling to the floor but none of it was of a language that I recognized. The outline of a man on the kitchen floor made me sick to my stomach, it was deeply stained in the wood and I don't think that any cleaning product would be able to clean that. He died in a sitting position facing the corner of the wall like he was trying to hide from something, just the way that i did when i was a child and had a fear of the dark. 

Speaking of dark, the house was abnormally dark, the moon was shining bright in the sky but inside the house it seemed as if it was dozens of meters underground. There was one thing that i noticed that didn't make sense to me, the house didn't have any lights, not a single one, it didn't had a television nor anything that could emitt light. The windows were all sealed shut and all the cracks on the walls were repaired from the inside, from what I've been told, the man only got out to buy food, he had a huge dispenser with basically everything that someone would need to survive. 

At this point I knew that this wasn't your generic abandoned house, there was something else to it, a purpose, something that deep down i could feel but couldn't put into words. The corner that i found the outline of him has in the far corner in the back left of the house, the house was in a rectangular shape and from where I was i could see all the way to the other corner. I wish I didn't looked at it. As soon as my eyes landed on that corner I undertood why he died facing the opposite way. Everything in my body told me to look away but i felt attracted to it. Every step that I took towards that corner I felt the space around me getting denser, like I was going down on a bottomless pool.

I started to rationalize it.

When I was face to face with the corner I began pondering about the whole evolution of humanity. There was something that made us come on top of the other humanoid species. Something that differed us. Some motive as to why we were the most intelligent species of the planet. We evolved to be like this, but when I saw that corner, I put all this aside and looked at it from other perspective. There must've been a mutation that protected us from this thing. I know that back in the stone age obviously we didn't have houses as we have them now, they didn't have a wooden floor to connect with the walls, they didn't have the rug that silenced my steps in the house. But in one way or another, my body knew what was happening, something in the back of my brain that was screaming at me to get the fuck out of this house, all my senses were profoundly filled with something.

Darkness.

I could smell it, I could hear it, I could sense it through all my body, I could taste it, I could see it right in the point where the walls connected with the floor. On top of all of this, I could feel it. Every single atom of my body knew that if I waited just a bit longer to get out of the house I would have had the same fate as the old man who tried to contain it in here. So I ran. I ran like there was a wild bear barely reaching me and when i finally got to my car i fled home like the speed limits didn't existed. I'm typing this after countless sleepless nights and a lot of risked walls. I don't think I've got out of the house in time.

Every animal survives based on its pattern recognition ability, some can recognize better than others, some are very bad at it, but every single one of the living beings on earth have it. This is what made humanity come so far. We could sense this thing, the most primal part of our brain could feel that we were not meant to be this close to it, some people may live their whole lifes without ever seeing it, some see it at a very young age, some feel it before they see it, you probably already came across it. 

It may be when you are thirst in bed while trying to sleep, you want to go get a cup of water but your body refuses to. It may be when you go upstairs two steps at once while feeling that cold on the back of your neck. It may be in the simplest things, but you will know when it happens, your body will take control over your mind, you won't have free will no more, your intuition will do what it thinks will make you survive through it. If this has happened to you, be thankful, thankful for your body to be able to evict it, thankful for your mind for being able to turn off your courage. 

Mine did not. 

I shouldn't have seen it. I should've turned away when I shivered as I was opening the door. I should've ran out of the house when I saw the outline of the man and felt my legs weakening. I don't think I will make it through, I've sealed every window in my house and turned off all the lights to try and make it blend with the environment, but it does not blend in. Darkness isn't enough to describe it, this is the pure absence of space itself. Like something from the 4th dimension ripped a piece of our world off. It stands out as if it was a lighthouse on an island in the middle of nothing. Nothing came close to it. I can feel it spreading through the house. Eating at every crevice beetwen the cracks on the floor. Coming closer and closer to me. This will be my last day in this world. I can't bear the weight of it in my mind. I'm already at the corner of the house. There is nowhere to escape. My body doesn't let me move towards it. 

I wish I had acted like this when i first saw the house. I wish I never entered it. Take this as a warning, trust your body and your intuition. Don't try to overcome your most primal fear. There is a reason we avoid the dark.

And if you ever feel your body going against your mind, don't fight it.
