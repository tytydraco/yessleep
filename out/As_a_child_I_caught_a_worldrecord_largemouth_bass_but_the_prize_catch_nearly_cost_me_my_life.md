I was obsessed with fishing as a kid. Growing up in a small Southern Georgia town, my summers were filled with long humid afternoons spent sitting on the shores of ponds, a cooler of Pepsi underneath my butt and a pole in my hand, reeling in a shiny lure. I’d catch bluegills, catfish, and the occasional carp. But my favorite fish, my Holy Grail, was the largemouth bass. I wanted to catch the biggest one ever. The heaviest largemouth bass is perhaps the most sought-after fishing record in the world, and it’s held strong for almost 100 years. On June 2nd, 1932, a man named George needed to feed his family of six. He was living in the depths of the Great Depression, and food was scarce, so George and his friend went out to Montgomery Lake, a place not far from where I grew up. They only had one fishing pole between them. But with one bite, the man caught enough fish to feed his family of six for two days: a largemouth bass weighing 22 pounds, 4 ounces. It was a monster! A legend! Today, catching a world record largemouth bass would probably net you two million dollars in prize money and endorsement deals, with a Netflix documentary to boot. 

Anyway, this is the story of how I broke the world record and almost lost my life in the process. I doubt most of you will believe it. It is a fishing story, after all. But trust me, it really happened. 

My father introduced me to the sport of fishing. He was a beanstalk of a man, jovial and gregarious. Always hanging out with his friends. Always off on some little adventure. Always drinking. His breath usually smelled of beer on the weekends when we’d go fishing. This was around 1993 or so. My pops brought me out to all these small, weed-choked retention ponds next to highways or office parks. He chose these locations because nobody ever fished them. They weren’t pretty. There was often random trash along the shoreline, like rusted cans or crumpled chip bags. But if no one fished them, that meant the big fish had no real predators. They could grow to immense size, never knowing the danger that lurked above their watery world. My Pops and I would bring a couple of graphite fishing poles and lots of shiny lures in a bright red tackle box. Then we’d spend the afternoon casting into the murky water, hoping for a bite. My dad would kill a six-pack of Michelob, and I’d kill a six-pack of Pepsi. The air would grow still, even stifling. Dragonflies buzzed around, occasionally landing atop my pole. I often grew bored and asked if we could go home. But each time Pops would tell me, “Just wait a little longer, son. Patience pays off.” It was during these times that I’d enter a trance-like state. My pole and I became one with our surroundings, like an extension of the oak trees whose branches hung over the water…

That’s when the fish would bite.

I’d set the hook, the reel would spin, and for the next two to ten minutes, life was only about one thing: landing that monster. My father would come running over to coach me. I’d twist and turn the pole, cranking its reel. Sometimes, Pops would assist if I had a massive fish on the line. During those moments, the rest of the world and all its problems seemed to disappear. There was only us. 

God, those days were perfect. 

My father passed in the summer of ‘96. It was a drunk driving accident. He was coming back from the bar with a few of his buddies when their Jeep flipped off an overpass, landing in a muddy ditch. Pops was supposed to be the designated driver that night. 

I stopped fishing for a while after that. I threw my pole away and smashed up Dad’s old tackle box with a baseball bat. I swore I’d never catch another fish. The whole mess was just too painful. But life has a funny way of bringing us back to our true selves. No matter what I did, from soccer to swimming to AV club, my father’s memory kept creeping back in like a ghost haunting my thoughts. 

When I entered the eighth grade, I met my best friend. We'll call him Kyle. He grew up fishing with his pops, too. He was the one who told me all about the largemouth bass world record. “You’d be a millionaire if you broke that one,” Kyle told me one day while we were eating lunch in the cafeteria. 

I told Kyle about an office park retention pond I used to fish with my father. “I swear I saw a bass almost 25 pounds just sitting there in the shallows.”

“Bullshit,” Kyle said. “How come you didn’t catch it?” 

“We tried,” I said. “My Pops and I tried every lure we had, but it wouldn’t bite nuthin’.” 

Kyle downed his orange juice in one long gulp. “We’re gonna catch that monster,” he said. “We’re gonna catch it and become rich. Whaddya say?” 

At first, I wanted to tell Kyle, “No.” I didn’t even have a fishing pole or tackle box anymore. But for some reason, whenever I talked about the sport with him, I didn’t feel angry, not like when other people mentioned fishing after my dad’s death. I guess Kyle’s easy-going demeanor reminded me a lot of Pops. And I began to realize that perhaps I could find closure by going on one last fishing trip. “Sure,” I  said.

After school, I asked my mother if she could take Kyle and me fishing that weekend: “We want to go to one of the old spots I’d go with Pops.”

“I thought you hated fishing,” my mother said. Ever since Pop’s passing, she had this ghostly look about her, like she wasn’t all there. She hadn’t been sleeping much, and she barely ate. She was all skin and bones, pale and haggard. It was like she’d given up. It pissed me off. 

“I never said that,” I lied. “Besides, Kyle has a brand-new carbon fiber pole and a tackle box he got for Christmas. We’ve got us a plan to catch a world-record largemouth bass.”

My mother sighed. She sighed so often back then. “That’s not proper grammar,” she said. “It should be ‘We have a plan to catch a world-record largemouth bass.’ And you’re not going fishing this weekend.”

“Why not?” I demanded.   

“Cause you have too much homework to catch up on,” my mother said. This was true. I’d missed a lot of school in recent months due to my temperamental moods. “And besides, it’s a waste of your time. Lord knows, your father pissed away too many hours at that so-called sport.”

“Those weren’t wasted hours,” I said, teary-eyed. 

My mother looked at me softly then, her eyes pained. “I know. I’m sorry, honey. But you’re still grounded until you get your grades up,” she said. “And that’s final.” 

*The Hell with what my mother wanted.* I told Kyle my plan the next day. As soon as my mom started her shift at AJ’s BBQ that Saturday, the two of us would sneak out on our bikes to make our fortune. We rode nearly ten miles to reach the retention pond that my father and I had visited a few years earlier. It was a long trip, and we were both sweating like hogs when we arrived, but we didn’t care. This was an adventure. 

“You went fishing here?” Kyle asked as he parked his bike. 

“Yeah,” I said. “I know it don’t seem like much.” The office park was as bland as you could imagine, featureless buildings of glass and concrete, well-manicured grass parkways, a few trees here and there, and a massive empty parking lot where all the worker drones would park their Toyota Camrys during the weekdays. It was all so manufactured. So fake. But the square retention pond in the middle of it all was full of life. 

Kyle and I parked our bikes in a copse of trees nearby.  

“My Mom would kill me if she knew I was so far from home without an ‘adult chaperone,’” Kyle said, taking out his tackle box. 

“How come?” I asked. 

“She worried about some madman supposedly snatching kids,” Kyle said. “But not so worried that she and my dad didn’t leave for Cabo this weekend.” Kyle’s older brother was supposed to be watching him, but the 18-year-old was off at a kegger instead.  

“Oh, you mean the Seivers kid?” I asked, referring to a 13-year-old boy who’d recently gone missing after he never came home from an afternoon swim at the community pool. “I think he just ran away.”

“Probably,” Kyle said. “But his friends said they saw some creepy black SUV in the area the last time they saw him.”

“You think he was kidnapped?” I asked.  

“Maybe,” Kyle said. “Maybe he ran away. Maybe he was eaten by cannibals.”  

I chuckled. “Probably. Kids are the tastiest, after all.” 

Kyle howled with laughter at that one. There were rumors of other kidnappings a couple of towns over— a teenage girl last seen at the beach, a couple of boys who were out on a boat on the St. Mary’s River. But no one had found any proof of foul play, and there was no connection between the incidents. Both were likely drownings. Still, it didn’t stop the local news from speculating and scaring every parent into keeping a closer eye on their kids. 

“If anyone tries to take us, I’ll kick ‘em in the nuts,” I said. My mother had taught me plenty about self-defense. The most surefire way to stop an attacker (and they were almost always male) was to give em a hard hit to the family jewels. 

“Yeah. I’d do the crane kick,” Kyle said, mimicking the famous move from *The Karate Kid* franchise*.* He’d been taking lessons at the local mini-mall. 

“Yeah. We’d fuck ‘em up real good,” I said, punching the air. 

Kyle laughed. He finished tying a sparkly worm-shaped lure to the end of the line. “Alright, let’s catch this beast.” 

As we approached the water’s edge, I spotted a posted sign: NO FISHING—$250 FINE. 

“Huh. That wasn’t there before,” I said. 

“Two hundred and fifty dollars,” Kyle said, bewildered. It might as well have been a million dollars to us. My allowance was only $10 a week back then. 

“It’ll be fine,” I explained. “No one comes over here on the weekends. It’s a ghost town.” I couldn’t help but wonder if they’d posted the sign because of all the fishing trips my Pops and I had taken earlier. 

Kyle shrugged, and we continued to the shoreline. I brought us to the exact spot where I’d last seen the monster bass. We sat on a couple of coolers we’d brought for snacks and drinks and got to fishing. Kyle and I took turns casting into the dark water. We fished for hours, switching between a half-dozen lures, from sparkly plastic worms to spinnerbaits to hard-bodied plugs. But we didn’t receive a single bite. Not even a nibble. Kyle was ready to call it a day when we saw the strange boy heading towards the pond. He was a scrawny little thing, no older than eight or nine. The boy carried a simple bamboo fishing rod that was at least three times as long as he was tall. It had no reel, just a line with a hook at the end. The tiny fella stopped a few yards from our position, plopping down on a tree stump. *How did he get out here*, I wondered. *And who would let him go all by himself?* 

Kyle approached the boy first. “Hey.”

The boy looked up at us. He wore simple clothes. Dirty brown. They clung to his gawky frame like rags. “Hey,” he said in a small voice. “I’m Bear.”

I almost chuckled. The boy was the complete opposite of his namesake. 

“I’m Kyle,” Kyle said. “That’s Peter.” 

I gave a half-hearted wave. 

Bear shoved the handle of his bamboo rod into the dirt beside him. “I saw yous fishing here and thought I’d try my luck. Catching anything?” 

“Just a couple sunfish,” Kyle lied. “Nothing major. We threw ‘em back.” 

“Mind if I fish next to ya?” 

“It’s free country,” I said. “Watchu using for bait?” 

“We got a bunch of lures if you wanna borrow one,” Kyle offered. 

“Nah. I don’t need no lures,” Bear said. “You don’t catch nuthin’ with lures. My daddy used to say, ‘Anything you want in life, you can attract it, but you gotta have the right kinda bait. The secret is always in the bait,’ he said.”

I noticed Bear had nothing else on him besides his fishing pole. No snacks. No soda. Not even a bottle of water. “Where are your parents?” I asked.  

Bear ignored my question. He cleared the ground of sticks and grass, revealing a patch of moist, black dirt underneath. “You wanna see something cool?” he asked.  

Kyle and I looked at each other. *There’s something off about this kid.*

“Sure,” I said. 

The boy flashed a snaggletoothed grin. “Watch this.” Bear placed his tiny hands flat against the earth. Then he hummed a little as he slowly raised them from the dirt. Within seconds, a dozen earthworms rose to the surface. 

“Whoa,” I said. “How’d you do that?”

Bear didn’t offer any explanation. He plucked a worm from the ground. “This is the best bait. The big fish, they’re all predators. And predators always prefer sumthin’ real. Sumthin’ alive.” Bear jabbed his fishhook into the earthworm. Blood and urine squirted from its fleshy body. “Now we’ll catch the big fish,” Bear said. The worm wriggled on the hook, struggling to break free. Bear swung his bamboo rod outward, flinging the hooked worm into the murky water. “Watch this.”

Kyle and I watched. Waiting. 

We didn’t have to wait long. 

The top of the pole lunged downward. Bear stood up and set the hook. Moments later, he dragged a small catfish from the pond. “Ya see? Went straight for the live bait,” Bear said, pulling his hook from the catfish’s whiskered mouth. Then, he flung the slimy creature back into the muddy shallows.    

“Can we fish with those worms?” I asked. 

“Sure,” Bear said. “Plenty to go around.”

Kyle and I squatted by the freshly dug dirt. There were dozens of worms dancing on its surface. “How’d you bring ‘em up like that?” I asked. 

Bear offered another snaggletoothed grin. “Sorry,” he said. “Trade secret.” 

*Ok. There’s definitely something off about this kid,* I wondered as I returned to the dirt, snatching a particularly fat worm. 

“He probably just sprinkled something on the ground to make ‘em come up,” Kyle said, kneeling beside me.

We fished for another hour using the worms Bear brought to the surface. We barely got each one wet before another fish bit. In minutes, we’d landed three bluegills, two smallmouth bass, and a golden shiner. But the final catch cemented it as the greatest hour of fishing in my life.

Moments after I’d plopped my last worm in the water, I felt a big tug on the line. 

“Hey. Hey!” I shouted. I almost set the hook right then, but Bear stayed my hand. “Wait. It ain’t swallowed it yet. Give it one more bite,” the boy said. “You gotta let it know you’re not a threat, or you’ll scare it away.” 

I took a deep breath and thought of my Pops’ famous words: *Patience pays off.* The next few seconds passed like hours. There was a little nibble, then another, then a big strike that caused a whirlpool on the pond’s surface. The rod bent nearly in half. 

“NOW!” Bear screamed. 

I set the hook, and the reel screamed as it let out hundreds of feet of line, while the fish zigged and zagged underwater. I fought that beast for what felt like hours, running along the shore, cranking the reel while Kyle and Bear cheered me on. Nothing else mattered at that point. Life was simple. Direct. Just me and the monster. A fight to the death. Eventually, I wore it down, dragging the fish into the shallows. It was a largemouth bass so big it looked like a submarine floating just beneath the surface. “Hold this,” I said. I gave the fishing pole to Kyle and ran into the lukewarm shallows to grab the exhausted bass by its fat mouth. When I picked it up, it felt like lifting a bag of bricks. The fish barely moved its tailfin as I held it up in the late afternoon sunshine like a golden trophy. 

“Holy shit. That’s gotta be the world record,” Kyle said. 

“Absolutely,” I agreed. 

Bear just stared at the scaly beast in hushed awe. 

I was beaming. It was the happiest moment in my short life–

“HEY!”

The sudden cry almost made me drop my prize catch. 

Two police officers walked down the embankment, a man and a woman in their early forties. 

“What’re you boys doing down here?” The man said. “Can’t you read?”

“Umm…”

“We’re sorry,” Bear said. His voice sounded extra small in the shadow of the officers. 

“It’s ok,” the woman said. “We just don’t want y’all getting hurt. There’s no fishing at this pond because it’s polluted.” She bent down until she was level with Bear. “My name’s Officer Kelly. That’s Officer Henry.”

“Are we under arrest?” Bear asked. His body trembled like a leaf in a hurricane.

“Oh, no, honey,” Officer Kelly said. 

“Usually, there’s a $250 fine for fishing here, but we’ll let you boys go with a warning,” Officer Henry said. “This time.” He had a broad face and a hulking body. There was a discolored patch around his lips. It reminded me of a kid I knew at school who had a port wine birthmark. 

“Th-th-thank you,” Kyle stammered. He looked ready to piss his pants. 

To be honest, I thought I might piss my pants, too. Just the thought of my mom finding out about this sent my heart fluttering. She’d kill me for lying, then kill me again for being so far from home without any parental supervision, and finally bury me for getting in trouble with the cops. *Was this going on my permanent record,* I wondered.   

“Drop that fish,” Officer Henry said, his icy blue eyes piercing mine.

“But…” *I fished my whole life for this.* *It’s a world record,* I wanted to say. *A million-dollar fish!* Perhaps I could’ve bribed him. But he’d never believe me. *Who would believe a story like that from some dumb hick kid?* So I threw the fish back into the pond without another word. The bass swam down, disappearing into the murky depths from whence it came. I never saw a fish that big again. 

“How’d you boys get out here?” Officer Kelly asked. 

“We-w-w-we biked,” Kyle stammered. But as he turned to look, his mouth fell open. No bikes were resting against the nearby trees. “Wait. Where’d…” Kyle started to say, but his voice trailed off. 

“Did you boys walk here all by yourselves?” Officer Kelly asked. She had a look of deep concern, as if she were our mother or something. “We can drive you all home.” 

“But… But our bikes were just there,” I said. “Someone must’ve stolen them.” *Did this happen while I was fighting the world-record bass*? *Had someone taken our bikes while we were distracted?* I didn’t voice these concerns aloud. 

All of a sudden, the sky grew dark. Towering storm clouds started to roll in overhead. 

“I think we need a ride,” Bear said. 

Officer Kelly smiled. “Come. Get your things and follow us.” 

We packed our stuff and followed the officers up the embankment and through the trees until we reached a lonely highway on the outskirts of the office park. There was a black Ford Explorer parked along the roadside. Its windows were all pitch-black, and it had no markings, no signs saying 'Police,' and no lights on its roof. 

“That’s not a cop car,” I said as we approached the Explorer. I stopped walking. 

Kyle stopped, too. “Yeah,” he agreed.   

In that moment, I remembered the Sievers kid who went missing near the community pool, and the rumors of a strange black SUV in the area the last time anybody saw him. *Was this the same car?*    

“It’s an undercover vehicle,” Officer Henry explained. He pulled out his car keys and pressed a button on the fob. A pair of red and blue lights flashed from behind the front windshield, clearly visible in the late afternoon gloom.

“Oh…” I didn’t know what else to say at that moment, but my body had this buzzing feeling, like anger mixed with anxiety. It was like I needed to keep challenging these cops. I found myself staring at their uniforms. They looked so neat and clean. *Too clean?* They almost reminded me of the uniforms you could buy at the Costume Depot around Halloween time. 

But their guns were definitely real. I could tell by the glint on the metal and how heavy they looked. They were just like the guns my uncle collected. 

“It’s ok,” Officer Kelly said. “None of you is under arrest. We’re just going to drop you off at home.”

The cops ushered us onward. Bear started walking, and after a moment, Kyle joined him. 

But I stayed put. “Can’t we just walk home?” I asked. 

“Peter, that’s like a million miles away,” Kyle said. “I ain’t walking that far in this heat.”

Suddenly, lightning flashed in the distance, followed by booming thunder. 

“And now it’s gonna storm,” Kyle said. 

“I’m scared,” Bear said. Out of all of us, he seemed the most eager to get on with this ordeal. 

“We’re not going to let three little kids walk home in this,” Officer Henry said. “It’s too dangerous.” 

I shot Kyle a wide-eyed look, a look I reserved for the most dire of circumstances, like when the Toomey Twins were on the playground and looking to rough up the younger kids. It was a look that said, *‘I don’t like this. I don’t like this one bit.’*   

Kyle just looked to the ground, like he was embarrassed or something.   

“Come on, now,” Officer Kelly said. She grabbed Kyle and me by our upper arms, leading us towards the back of the SUV. 

Bear followed. He didn’t need any coaxing.

I was pale and sweaty, fighting off a wave of nausea. I wanted to vomit, but I was too scared to tell anyone. I don’t know where this sickness came from, but it came on swift and sudden. 

“It’s gonna be ok.” Officer Kelly said. She opened the back of the SUV. Not one of the back doors. The lift gate. Inside was a big, open space. The seats were GONE. It was just an empty metal cage with chains and locks. They’d chained our bikes against the back wall. 

I was about to scream when a wet cloth covered my face, and then everything went dark.

\-

I awoke sometime later, jostled in the dark as a car engine roared. I was trapped in the back of the SUV, inside its cage. Something round and plastic filled my mouth— a ball gag. I tried to scream through it, but no sound came out. Drool spilled from my bruised lips. Then, I tried moving my arms and legs, but they were shackled to the floor. That’s when I noticed Kyle and Bear beside me. They were gagged and tied up, too, their eyes as big as saucers. All three of us wriggled our bodies in the dim cage, trying to break free while the truck knocked us around. It felt like we were driving along a dirt road riddled with potholes. I don’t know how long we were in the back of the awful car, hearing its engine scream, but it felt like infinity. 

*This is it,* I thought. *Not even fourteen years old, and I’m about to die.* It’s strange. I wasn’t that scared at the time. I just had this overwhelming sense of sad acceptance. *I’ll never get to experience high school*. *Or fall in love. I’ll never grow old, just like my Pops.* It got really bad when I remembered my mother. *First, her husband, and now her only child?* She’d totally waste away from the loss, all alone in our big house. Tears streaked across my face. *It’s all my damn fault,* I thought. *We were all gonna die because I wanted to break some stupid fishing record.* *And I just let them take us. I didn’t even try to fight back. There was no kick to the nuts. No valiant battle for our lives. Just a quiet and sad surrender.* I was weak and scared. I was just a dumb kid. A dumb, dead kid.

Finally, the vehicle stopped, and “Officer Kelly” opened the lift gate. I was surprised to see it was dark outside. There was no more storm. Soft moonlight illuminated a dense and endless forest beyond. We were in the middle of nowhere. Kelly unhooked each of us, pulling us from the SUV one by one. She took Bear first, then Kyle. Neither moved. They were like rag dolls in the woman’s arms. 

But when Officer Kelly got to me, I gave her the fight of my life. I wriggled and kicked as hard as I could, even with my hands and legs bound. One kick landed square in Kelly’s chest, causing her to gasp. 

“Oh, you’re a feisty one, aren’t you?” Officer Henry said as he wrenched me from the back of the SUV. I fell to the leaf-strewn ground, exhausted and nauseous. I was terrified that I’d throw up with the ball gag on, choking on my vomit. I didn’t know what true terror was… 

Not yet. 

Once outside the car, I noticed we were beside a campsite. A bonfire raged in a nearby clearing, illuminating a series of broken-down trailers. They looked like they’d been lying in the woods for ages, rotten and festering with rust and mold. 

A pair of adults danced around the bonfire, a man and a woman, naked as Adam and Eve. They held liquor bottles in their hands. The dancers stopped when they saw Kyle, Bear, and me plop onto the ground. I’ll never forget the look in their fire-gleaming eyes, even if I live for a hundred and fifty years. It still makes my skin crawl just remembering it. The naked dancers stared at us with animalistic hunger. 

“Welcome to Hell,” Officer Henry said as he looked down at us, smiling. *Did he always have missing teeth,* I wondered? That birthmark of his glowed in the moonlight, dark and disgusting. It reminded me of a story I’d heard in grade school, an old urban legend about a man who ate people. There’s a certain rash you can only get from consuming raw human flesh.  

*They’re going to eat us!!!* 

Then, a horrible sound crowded out all my thoughts. It was the worst sound I’ve ever heard in my life— A girl’s scream, coming from one of the trailers. She sounded around seven years old. Her tiny voice… It was a mixture of pain and pleading, a deep, guttural sound, a sound no child should ever make.  

“Don’t worry,” Officer Kelly said, noting the horrified look on my ashen face. “She won’t feel a thing soon enough. It just takes a minute.” 

The little girl’s screams suddenly stopped, and a cold, deafening silence followed. At that moment, I didn’t want to give this life another second, much less a minute. I wanted to die. 

“Let’s take the little one first,” Officer Henry said, referring to Bear. “He’ll be easy.” 

Officer Kelly grabbed Bear by his scrawny arms and lifted him.

I shut my eyes. It was too much to watch. 

But then I heard Officer Kelly gasp. And I peeked out to see–

Bear had seized up, shaking off Kelly’s grip. The boy flopped onto the ground beside the bonfire as his body curled in a rictus of spasms. 

The naked couple walked over to examine the strange sight. “What’s going on?” “Is he dead?” 

Then, there was a loud pop, like a balloon exploding. A cracked ball gag flew past my vision. It was Bear’s gag. Another series of pops signaled his bindings had ripped apart. 

“What the fuck?” 

Bear stood before the bonfire, his tiny body silhouetted against the raging flames. The boy looked at Kyle and me, and I swear to God, he smiled. That same snaggletoothed grin. “Watch this.” Bear’s silhouette exploded into a plethora of long, spindly arms, like a massive black spider. 

“Fuck!” Officer Henry pulled his gun and fired a series of shots at the Bear-creature. 

But the bullets did nothing. 

Bear’s long arms formed giant hooks that grabbed the adults, slicing through skin and bone. In seconds, he’d become a multi-armed behemoth, ripping and tearing the adults apart in a torrent of violence. Limbs flew. Skin separated from muscle. Skulls and spinal columns fell onto the ground. Blood splattered everywhere, drenching the leaves, drenching us, drenching everything.

When it was all over, Officer Henry, Officer Kelly, and the naked couple… They were just piles of gore and guts on the ground. The Bear-Creature crawled into the nearby trailers. More screams emanated from within. Adult screams. Guilty screams. I don’t know how long the carnage had lasted, but it wasn’t long enough. As a father now myself, I believe their deaths were too quick. 

In any case, Kyle and I lay there on the leafy ground until it was all over. That’s when Bear finally returned, back in his tiny, child-like form. He untied our bindings. Kyle and I were too scared to speak, even after Bear removed the ball gags. We just stared at the kid, wondering if this was some Godforsaken nightmare. 

“Go home,” Bear said. His voice was no longer meek, but strong and confident. It was an aged voice. Older than the oldest man I’ve ever known. 

“What…” I started to ask, but the boy held a scrawny finger up to my lips. “Shh. Don’t tell anyone. Not even your parents.” I felt a strange tingling sensation throughout my body. Instant goosebumps all over.   

“Why?” I asked. 

“Trade secret,” Bear said, pulling his hand away. He offered one more snaggletoothed grin. 

Then, he walked off, disappearing into the dark woods. 

We never saw Bear again. 

\-

Kyle and I biked home as dawn bathed our suburban neighborhood in a red glow. We didn’t say a word to one another. I think we were both too shocked to formulate any coherent thoughts. I just kept wondering if this was all a dream. But reality came crashing back when I arrived home.

There were cop cars parked outside. Real cops this time. My mother screamed when she saw me parking my bike at the end of our driveway. 

“Peter!”

That’s when the floodgates opened. I ran into my mother’s warm arms, blubbering like a newborn. Tears clouded my vision. “I’m sorry,” I managed to get out between heaving sobs. “Kyle and I— We wanted to— I'm sorry. I’ll never go out alone again. I promise.”

“It’s ok,” my mother said, squeezing me tight. “You’re safe now. I’m not letting you go. Not ever.”

We both fell to our knees in the front yard, crying and hugging each other. I’d never felt such deep relief before. Golden sunlight streamed across the lawn, painting the grass bright green in the morning dew. We kept crying there for who knows how long. But at some point, I remember seeing a small patch of dirt beside us. I reached out my hand and placed it on the soil. And as I slowly raised my fingers… a dozen worms came wriggling to the [surface](https://www.reddit.com/user/BoxGoblin/).
