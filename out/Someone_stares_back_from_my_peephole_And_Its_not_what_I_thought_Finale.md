My eyes stay tightly shut, but the images still push through the darkness: the woman and the man, their outlines sharp and clear. Something is moving inside me—a slippery sickness crawling through my bones, changing me from the inside out.

The man’s shape becomes clearer—his side view thin and shadowy, though I still can’t fully see his face. It stays just out of reach, teasing me from the dark. The woman remains a shadow, but her edges glow more now, a ghost-like light shining in the emptiness. I don’t know when my eyes will finally open, but until they do, I’m stuck in this frozen moment. No movement. No sound. Only their presence, pressing into my thoughts like a heavy stone.

Later, my voice breaks as I whisper to Google Assistant, “What time is it?” Its robotic answer—11:30 PM—drops into the silence like a stone in a deep well, sending little ripples through me. I know the bell will ring again tonight, like some ancient switch meant to pry my eyes open. I cling to that weak hope, like a rope slowly falling apart in the dark.

It’s 11:59 now. I crouch by the door, the damp wood chilling my joints, my breath short and shaky. I need to open my eyes. I can feel it—my other eye aches to show me the truth, its pull pounding at the back of my head. The bell rings—a sharp, sad sound that cuts through the silence. A bit of cold relief slips in as my eyelids rip open with each chime, peeling back like old skin from a sore. The grip is gone.

I press my eye to the peephole. The cold metal stings my skin, and my breath fogs the glass. Nothing looks back at me—just the elevator doors, dull and faintly shining under the yellow light of the hallway. The bell rang, but nothing’s there. More relief trickles in, shaky and warm. Maybe the curse has left me, loosened its grip from my soul.

I stumble to the bathroom, the floor groaning beneath me like tired bones. I just want to wash the night’s stink off my body. But then my eyes betray me—blinking too fast, a wild flutter like flies caught in a web. They slam shut, heavy as tomb doors. The visions come back.

The man’s face appears clearly now, and fear claws its way into my chest. It’s the real estate agent—his skinny frame, his sharp voice still echoing in my head. A shiver runs down my back. The woman steps out of the shadows, and I see her torn dress, its ragged edge swinging. It’s just like mine. The truth hits hard: I’m that woman.

Then, with a series of rapid blinks, I’m taken back to the moment I shook hands with the agent before getting into his car. I see an anti–evil eye figurine hanging from the dashboard. I read his lips as he says, *“Do you believe in the evil eye? I do. My mom says our family is cursed by someone’s evil eye. I’m the one tasked with getting rid of it. Haha, moms are funny, you know.”*

Panic fogs my mind. I try to look at him again, but his face changes—one of his eyes is gone, replaced by a wet, bloody hole. My breath catches. When he showed me this place, both his eyes had been bright—normal, untouched, reflecting sunlight.

The bell sounds again, and my eyes open just in time, wet and shaking. I run to the peephole, heart pounding, but the hallway is still empty—no eye, no shadow, just the soft hum of the elevator chewing through the quiet. I stagger back to the bathroom. The air is thick with a moldy, sour smell. I need water to cool the fire inside my head.

Then I see my reflection in the mirror, like a nightmare burned into the glass. My left eye has turned a deep greenish-black, red and swollen around the edges, dripping and sore. And then, as if recognizing itself, the eye starts to melt—black liquid trailing down my cheek. A scream bursts out, wild and raw, echoing off the tiles.

Horrified, I stumble back to my apartment, slamming the door and locking it with shaky, sweaty hands. A minute—or maybe two—passes, each second dragging heavy and slow.

**Then the bell rings again.**

Trembling, I walk to the kitchen and grab a knife. This time, instead of looking through the peephole, I place a small circular mirror over the peephole. Moments later, I witness the same black liquid finding its way into my apartment.

And then I see him.

Standing just outside, the real estate agent is missing both of his eyes now—his face a sunken mask of pain and purpose. He stares forward blindly, and with a rattling breath, says, *“Only half of the transfer process remained.”* Then he drops to the ground, lifeless.
