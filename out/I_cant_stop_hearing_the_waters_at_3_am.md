I'm lying in bed, eyes wide open, counting the eerie dancing shadows cast by the trees and tens of other whatnots on the wall in front of me. It's a dimly lit night of the new moon, and yet the fading moonlight managed to sneak through the gaps in the curtains, bathing the room in its pale luminance.

There's the sound of water. 

Among the clock, the crickets and the rattles of the frayed apartment, there's a foreign sound and it's what'd knocked me out of my sleep. Water. It isn't the rain nor the sewage that runs too close to my window, but more of a late-night shower from an apartment upstairs, which takes place at a very questionable time and has lasted for an alarmingly long period. 

I look at my phone. It's three o'clock in the morning, on a normal Monday night, meaning that nobody should be taking a shower. Still, there's the sounds of water, falling, splashing, rippling, slowly, steadily, annoyingly, coming to me through the ceiling above my head.

I turn again, this time to the opposite side, only to find myself facing a worse distraction – the closed wardrobe door, dark and wooden, silent and looming over me, threatening like a wicked giant monster. I built the wardrobe myself, and yet right at that moment, I can sense my skin jumping at its familiarity.

I sigh and return to my back, lying face-up, eyeing the ceiling. I can vaguely picture the pipes hidden behind the wood and the cement, above my apartment but beneath the one upstairs, seeing with my imagination the water running through them and causing the noise that startled my sleep. I was in the middle of a nightmare and yanked back to reality when I heard it.  

The nightmare was far from pleasant, but right now I want nothing more than to be able to get back there. I was involved in a ritual with some of my friends, offering a demon my blood with the promise to never lie. Except…I lied. It was just a stupid ritual game and I didn't think much, and apparently the absence of a thorough conscience comes with a hefty price. 

The demon hunts me down, typical dream chases. I was cornered and looking right at it, and I was terrified. It was a dream, but it was vivid. The demon has a long tongue, twisted limbs and a bent neck. Its skin is like a printing paper, veins of blood running all over the place. 

As soon as the demon opened its mouth to talk, I heard the sounds of water. It makes my hair grow thinking about it. The demon has the voice of a running shower.

The water doesn't stop. 

If anything, it only gets louder, now that my focus’ solely fixed on it. The splash of the shower hitting the floor, the glub of the flow going down the drain, the burbles when it rushes through the pipes, the echo as it ripples above the ceiling, and then the repeat of the whole damned cycle, all of them are blaring and drilling, constantly torturing my ears. 

I have no idea why someone in their right mind would think of this as a good time for a shower, let alone one that has lasted for longer than necessary. None of them seems to make any sense to me, and at some point, I feel the urge to go there to check if the residents are alright enough to be let alone with a shower running freely for that long.

I end up doing nothing, however. A part of me knows that there's nobody crazy enough to take a shower; or nobody at all. I haven't seen anyone living there ever since I moved here. The remaining part of me knows something else. That the water has something to do with me, me alone, probably connected to my nightmare.

Precisely, with the demon to whom I offered my blood and promised not to lie, only to do the exact same forbidden thing.

That's why I stay inside my apartment, enveloped by the mess of the room, curling up into a ball and hanging onto the faint hope that the act somehow  mutes the foreign sound of water. Much to my surprise and dismay, it doesn't, if not my efforts have somehow made the volume grow louder than before. 

I reach up with the fingers spread out, instinctively, grabbing my earlobes and trying to block the sound away. It seems like something a coward would do, but I don't care. I let my ears be covered and close my eyes, in a failed attempt to escape reality and lure myself back to the nightmare, only to be stirred up and startled again, by the increasing volume of that damned cycle. 

Splash. Glub. Ripple. Echo. Splash. Glub. Ripple. Echo.

It isn't until then do I realize that the water doesn't sound like something from outside, but more like a reverberation of what seemed to be stored and buried inside of me. 
 
I don't know how long I've stayed in that position, but as the realization makes me swing off the blanket and sit up with my feet on the floor, my body's all sweaty. A wise person would call in, preferably the cops or the hospital, for an emergency. I just freeze. I'm THAT stupid, what can I say?
 
I look up above my head and wait, engulfing myself in the sound of water which stands out against the silence of my room, against anything that's a part of reality. I hear it loud and clear and feel every inch of my body clenching to it. My fingers are buried into the soft fabric of my mattress, my toes dig deeper into the wooden floor, my eyes are urged to shut but stay painfully open, my throat is stuffed with a lump, and my heart sinks, almost as if it has stopped functioning. 

And then, with almost an abrupt halt of the heartbeat, a missed blink of my dry and burning eyes, without any sign, warning, or expectation, the water suddenly stopped. 
It happens without me even fully acknowledging it during the first seconds, and it takes me a while to realize that the sound that knocked me out of my sleep is now gone. 

The usual silence of the night returns, so clear that I can hear my unsettling heartbeats and ragged breath. Then the familiar crickets, wind rustles, and house rattles dominate my hearing again as if they weren't just toppled a few seconds ago by the bizarre sound of a late-night bizarre shower.

It seems who–or what–ever decided to do it has realized the stupidity and health hazard of their actions, so instead of going with the nonsense flow, they turned off the shower like a normal and functioning human who gives a damn about their wellbeing. They should be in bed then, now that I hear no noise that interferes with the usual and natural sounds of whatever coming to life at three-ish in the morning. 

It should be the most probable thing to do at this hour, also the most logical explanation to what had taken place in the apartment upstairs, and yet something inside me isn't fully convinced. My instinct spikes here and there, trying to remind me of something I don't want to remember, my eyes still burning, my throat feels stuffy, and my heart remains seized with an invisible force I can't name. 

I ignore the feelings and release them, one by one, through my deep sighs as I collapse on the mattress, letting my body be sucked into the sweaty pile of blanket and pillow. From the corner of my eyes, I see the clock on my nightstand. It's four in the morning, meaning roughly an hour has passed. 
Somebody upstairs, who shouldn’t have been there in the first place, had just taken an almost two-hour-long shower, letting the water flow constantly, and I have no idea why they abruptly ended it. 

Or, do I?

As I look at the wardrobe I built myself, the eerie feeling returns. The nightmare's image filled my head, bit by bit. It was a nightmare, but it was also a reflection of reality. I played a horror ritual game with my friends. We weren't allowed to lie. I lied. I lied. I lied. 

Pieces of memories return. I lied, so my friends died. We all hid in my wardrobe and got killed there, so that's why earlier I found it uncanny. My friends all died, but the demon spared me, somehow. Maybe there's a hidden rule that the liar prevails in the game and all of us were just simply illiterate enough to miss it. Maybe I did something to help myself through it. Maybe I made a deal with the demon so that my friends had to go first, and I was allowed to remain. 
My head turns empty. Everything starts to blur again, and I'm not sure if it'd come back someday. But there's one thing I remember for sure.

I had blood all over my body. I had to take a shower. The game ended with my friend's death at 3 in the morning, and that's when I started removing the blood.
