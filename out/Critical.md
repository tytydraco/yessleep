"Is this a new assignment?" I asked my supervisor who had handed me a folder. It only had two documents inside with a sticky note stuck in the front. Printed in big red letters it read "CRITICAL". I have been a caregiver for years; I can't count how many cases I've come across that were labeled "SEVERE" at most but never this. I glanced at my supervisor who immediately walked away after handing it to me. That was odd. She always gave me full details and specified instructions. This time she just handed me the folder and left it as if to say it was left up to my judgment what I would do with this patient. As I walked out the door of the office to head to my car knowing this would be a home visit I quickly glanced in the contents of the folder. There was no photo attached. The information was relatively short and only a few notes were made.  
  
She was only 21; had just given birth and was diagnosed with postpartum depression. Below her general information there were two notes that were left by the previous caretaker "uncooperative and aggressive. refuses assistance and asked to be left alone." "attempted to provide care but patient was hostile. final decision to withdraw care and referred for a caregiver with experience on difficult cases". I closed the folder and thought to myself that it wasn't surprising. Most difficult cases were brought to me; it takes special care, a huge amount of patience, and resilience to handle cases like this. I would know; I can't count how many times I've been spat at, badmouthed, and try to be driven out by patients who eventually accepted over time I wasn't going anywhere and with a little firm treatment understood they weren't going to get their way and all they could do was cooperate.  
  
 On the drive to the patient's home, I began contemplating what kind of situation I would find. If she had been that way with the previous caregiver how is she now? Has she been better or has she worsened? Obviously, it's been a while since she was last visited, and judging from her file she hasn't had another caregiver since the last one. Moreover; how was her baby and was her baby taken due to her previous behavior and diagnosis? It didn't mention it in the file but I prayed they did for the safety of her newborn. I was getting close to the location of the home; it was at the far end of a quiet neighborhood. The house wasn't new; the paint on the outside walls of the house and door was faded and stained, the plants on the side of the home were overgrown, and there weren't any lights on that could be seen from the outside of the house except for what seemed to be a room on the second floor where part of the curtains were open to let in a little sunlight from the window.   
  
As I got out of the car and turned off the engine I could feel a heaviness in the air; I felt suspended and it seemed as if the house and area surrounding seemed detached from the rest of the neighborhood. I went up to the door and pressed the doorbell; once, twice, and three times before I eventually knocked and asked if there was anyone home. No one answered and so I tried to turn the knob. It made a complete turn and I pushed the door inward. "who leaves their front door unlocked, especially with an infant in the home?" I thought to myself. As I entered the home the smell immediately hit my nose. It was unlike anything I ever smelled. It smelt sweet almost but burnt and decaying; like a pear gone bad, drenched with fragrance to try to mask the smell and then doused with bleach.   
  
None of the lights were on and the house was dark as it was when I saw it outside. "Annie?" I yelled hoping for an answer but there was none "Hi Annie; I'm your new caregiver. Are you upstairs?" I yelled again; still no response. As I etched my way towards the steps I could hear someone; a soft voice singing walking towards the farthest bedroom I could make out that it was a lullaby. You could see a shadow on the floor peaking of someone sitting in a rocking chair cradling an infant in her arms wrapped in a blanket, or so I thought. Despite repeatedly calling her name softly the woman never turned around. The room was dark and musty but I knew this was where the smell resonated from since it amplified the smell the most in this room. As I came closer I headed to her side where the sunlight would hit her face so I could get a glimpse of her. As I slowly faced her I came to a horrifying discovery.   
  
She was cradling her newborn, but from its appearance, you could tell it had already passed for quite some time. The baby was visibly purple and pale. But that's not what made me jump back; it was the baby's eyes and bruised face and body that stunned me the most. The eyes looked as if they were dug out and the bruises on the body looked as if the baby had been severely mishandled. "The world is evil. She doesn't deserve to see it and she will never experience it." muttered the mother repeatedly. As I tried to back away and head for the door I could hear her getting up from the chair and heading in my direction. I raced towards the door and ran down the stairs. In my hurried state to dash towards the front door I tripped as I reached the bottom of the steps. Quickly getting up I regained my footing and ran out the front door.   
  
As I turned to close the door behind me the light from outside hit a part of the living room; you could see a silhouette of an individual laying on the floor next to the living room couch; from the form, it looked like a male figure with a somewhat big build, his face deformed and discolored facing forward towards the front door; no eyes same as the infant. At the end of the steps there she stood holding her baby and looking at what I had been fixated on before mouthing the words "She needed her dad and she will need me." I quickly closed the door behind me before she could take another step and got into my car and dialed 911 as I sped off.
