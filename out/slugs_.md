When I was growing up, our house was filled with slugs. It was weird. We would mostly find them in the garbage on the old beer cans or in the bathroom where it was moist. My dad called them beer slugs. Apparently, there's some weird German slug that really likes beer. They would crawl around searching for it. When I was younger, I would put cups of beer out in the yard, and the slugs would come running for the beer, jumping into the liquid and drowning in it. Every day, I would come out, empty the cups, fill them back up, and hope it would help with the slug problem.

But one day, my mom couldn't handle the slugs. She laughed, and it was just me and my dad. And the slugs went away. My dad was a good, honest man—strong and smart. He worked at a restaurant. He loved cooking, creating, and working with his hands, and he loved me and my mom. But after she left, he seemed to get less fun, though he seemed happier. And the slugs went away. They would show up periodically around my dad's car, sometimes in his room, and I would have to set out the beer traps again, catch all the slugs, and throw them out in the garbage like always. But eventually, I had to do it less and less, and soon the slugs were gone for good.

I moved out, got a job, started going to community college, and started dating. I got engaged and had a life away from those gross little bugs. Sometimes I forget that our house used to be filled with slugs. When we visit, I get horrible memories of lifting up the toilet seat and seeing the entire toilet bowl filled with slugs crawling around like a writhing mass, eating each other. I still get memories about it, but I don't tell my fiancée. I feel like it would creep her out too much, and I don't want to make the relationship weird. We struggle sometimes. Every once in a while, nothing too big, just when we have fights, they’re bad. My dad is cautious around her, and sometimes I catch him staring at her. Not in a creepy or sexual way, just staring. She does kind of look like my mom sometimes. It creeps me out, but I love her nonetheless.

As for my mom—well, after she left my dad, she would visit me but slowly stopped. We still kept in contact and saw each other every once in a while, but we don’t really have a strong relationship. When we do talk, it’s usually over the phone and about something she just remembered after all these years, something she forgot in the grocery store that she has to tell me, just so I know she still cares. She has a second family away from everything and a whole new life. But I’m happy for her. I’m happy she moved on.

Everything was all right for a good long while. My wife and I got married and had our first baby. My dad was still working as hard as ever and started adopting cats. My mom still kept in contact with us, talking with me every once in a while about how her day was going and how life was. As I got older and started to drink myself, I started noticing slugs in the garden.

The first slug I noticed, my son had picked up and was trying to eat. I quickly ripped it out of his hand and squashed it. Then we went inside, had applesauce, and watched SpongeBob for the rest of the day. The next few were still in the garden. My son would try to eat them, and I would have to take them away and feed him something else, like banana or avocado, his favorite.

As it got worse, I started finding them in my trash—at least in the outside trash. I didn’t think anything of it. I threw weird crap in there, and I just thought they were getting at the old food and decayed fruit. Since the weather was cooling down, I thought they liked the cool, wet environment.

Then I found one in the house. It was crawling around my bedroom floor. It was only one slug, though. I thought it crawled through the windows, so I started resealing the windows and floors of the house. It was an old, well-loved house, so something crawling in wasn’t that unusual. The repairs took a few months. Because of the repairs, I stopped drinking, and the slugs went away. I thought that was the end of my worries, and I went about normal life—working, coming home, having a drink, taking care of my son, tending to our garden, and going to bed.



And then I found them again in my garden—more numerous. So I went to the store and picked up Slug Killer, spraying it around my flowers and vegetable garden. No matter how much I poisoned the land, they kept coming back. Eventually, I started buying pool salt and sprinkling it over areas filled with slugs. It became almost an obsession. I didn't want them in my house. I didn’t want them in my toilet, crawling around, and infecting everything around me. I didn’t want to see those rising masses of slugs in the toilet when I tried to use it late at night.

I was most likely overreacting after what happened when I was younger. Waking up late at night and finding slugs in your bathroom, stepping on them—it was the worst feeling, especially in socks.

So I kept my religious fervor and kept killing slugs. I also found out my neighbors started having slug problems in their own gardens. A few of them switched to astroturf. A few others started salting areas that had no growing plants and got rid of any moisture in their backyard, such as big piles of compost or rotting wood. My wife thought it was silly that we were doing all of this over slugs. I thought it was weird too, and eventually, we went on our first family vacation together.

I was able to relax, drink, party, and have a good time for the first time in weeks as I stopped obsessing over the slugs. The slugs fell into the back of my mind... until we got home.

The bathroom. They were in the room. They were on the curtains. They were under every rug.

I started quickly grabbing as many as I could with my bare hands, throwing them outside or down the toilet, flushing them down the drains. My wife thought it was amusing and started taking care of them. She brought out a massive old fish tank and started filling it with slugs, dirt, and things they could eat. I kept desperately trying to kill them, but eventually, I started taking care of them too.

She kept saying, “It’s okay, they’re just slugs. They’re harmless; they can’t do anything on their own, so we need to take care of them.” And, “I don’t know why you fear them so much. They’re just bugs.”

It happened slowly. We would buy one fish tank, decorate it all nice, and then put any slugs we found around the house in it. And when it became too full, we would buy another, and another. One thing we didn’t take into account was that slugs are hermaphrodites—they just kept reproducing nonstop. Eventually, there were tanks all around our house, filled to the brim with squirming bodies. I don’t know what happened. Everything was abuzz with rot. It was something slow, like gaining weight. You don’t really notice it until the shirt you love doesn’t fit you exactly right, so you stretch it out and feel bad because you messed up the design on the front. So, you get one in an extra-large, then a 2X. Eventually, you’re in a 5X, lying in bed, unable to move.

Eventually, we noticed our son had stopped crying. He used to cry constantly while we tried to take care of the slugs and feed them rotten fruit. My wife was so obsessed with them that she ignored our boy, and I was so out of it that I couldn’t hear his cries.

We only really noticed when my dad came by. It was one of the brief times I felt awake enough to notice that he wasn’t crying anymore. But my dad just laughed about it, saying he was a quiet baby. I tried to laugh with him, but I just felt lost.

When I could go to work, other people avoided me like the plague and thought of me as a loser. A loser with slugs in his house. A loser with greasy hair. A loser covered in slime.

One night, one of my coworkers took pity on me and let me crash at her place for the night. For the first time in God knows how long, I was able to take a bath. I felt clean. I slept on a couch. I kept convincing her to let me stay another night, and another, so I didn’t have to go home to the slugs, my son, and my wife.

I was able to weasel my way into a week of her life before being forced to go home. And for the first time, I felt like I could see clearly. I walked through the house, seeing the slugs crawling around. Most of them had sunk into the carpet. My wife was desperately trying to take care of them. My dad was on the couch, just staring off.

Periodically, my wife would run over to the fridge, grab beer, and pour it into my dad’s mouth before running back to her slugs and wetting them down with the hose she had dragged in from outside. I watched her do this for 30 minutes before slowly making my way to our son’s room. The colorful painted walls were now dull and covered in green slime and mucus from the slugs. As I creaked open the door and peered into his room, it was just the way we had left it. Except he wasn’t in his crib anymore. There was a stain, a gray-brown puddle on his bed, and bits of something there—but he wasn’t.

I slowly walked back to my wife, and she sat me down and handed me a beer.

And I drank.
