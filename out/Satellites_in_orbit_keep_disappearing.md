Posting this here is in breach of my NDA, but people need to know about this!

  
I work for a company that tracks space debris. This can be anything unusable from dead satellites, discarded rocket stages, to junk like screws, paint chips, etc. that orbits the Earth. Debris in space move at extremely high speeds and there are multiple examples of paint flakes damaging entire satellites. 

  
We have our own network of micro satellites that track the debris. Information about location and speed of these debris is extremely important during rocket launches so that there is no collision risk when trying to put a new satellite in space. We have worked with almost every major space agency in the world. NASA, ESA, JAXA, ISRO, and once, even the Chinese.

  
The disappearances started in late August 2021. An old geostationary satellite belonging to ISRO suddenly disappeared off their systems. An investigation revealed no concrete results but it was assumed that it might have come into contact with some un-tracked debris and it being old, simply stopped working. 

  
It’s not like stuff like this hasn’t happened before and it wasn’t a great loss to them as that satellite’s replacement had already been in orbit for quite some time already.

  
A request came out to all companies that track space debris, including ours, to notify them if we ever tracked anything resembling their satellite and to classify it as junk. No one ever found it.

  
Life went on.   


Until three months later in November 2021, when one of NASA’s military satellites went missing. This was a much more advanced and a much newer satellite. And this one rang a few alarm bells. It disappeared right when it was passing over the South China Sea. There were suspicions that China might be involved in either shooting it down, disabling it, or somehow snatching it from orbit. The CIA got involved.   


Another request came out. This time from NASA; to keep a lookout for their missing satellite while their investigation continued. We couldn’t find this one either.  


Until two months later, when another NASA satellite went missing.

  
This was a geological satellite in low-earth orbit over the Pacific. It was first assumed that it had probably malfunctioned and fallen into the Ocean. But extensive searches revealed no debris in the ocean and no impact crater on the islands.   


After this, the disappearances just picked up pace. Over the next 18 months, a total of 27 satellites have gone missing.  They’ve vanished regardless of space agency, age of the satellites, altitude or type of orbit. A massive inter-governmental investigation is currently underway with everyone having lost their satellites and everyone claiming no involvement in their rivals’ lost satellites.  


And then the Black Knight went missing and the disappearances stopped.

  
For those who don’t know, the Black Knight Satellite is a non-natural object of unknown origin that has been orbiting the Earth for a long time. NASA and others just classify as debris; so, we had been tracking it. Some sources say that it has been in orbit from even before humans launched the first rocket. UFO theorists claim it’s either an alien spacecraft or part of an alien spacecraft. I considered it bullshit, but not anymore!   


Over the next 8 months, no satellite has been reported missing. Which brought many to theorize that whoever or whatever was responsible was looking for something. And they found it. We thought it was finally over!

  
Well, not really. I wouldn’t be writing this if this was true. You see, in June of this year, for the first time ever, we detected an *appearance*. An unknown object has begun orbiting Earth exactly where the Black Knight disappeared from. And if the readings are correct, it is massive in size! Much bigger than any of the satellites that have gone missing.

  
We notified NASA and were immediately made to sign an NDA. But over the last month, other companies and space agencies have detected the object as well. And I cannot, in good conscience, stay silent.

  
Someone is coming for us. They’re here. And we need to be ready!
