Every job has one, some son of a bitch who gets his or her Jimmie’s off by brown nosing the boss and snitching over the smallest thing. A damn snake.

Jacob was no different. The man loved to pretend he knows more than you, wouldn’t shut up about coon hunting, politics, and has a god awful laugh.

I make certain parts for one of the biggest car dealers in the country. I do my job well and better than most, but I don’t care like that. It all pays the same.

My boss came up to me today and said he had a new hire who needed training. I was excited since that meant some extra pay and  not pressured to run as much product.

An elderly woman reached out to shake my hand.

“My name is Macy.”

“Hello, my name is Mikey.”

“Oh, that’s my late husbands name…Michael.”

We didn’t waste too much time talking before I started teaching her small things on the job. I took a slow process to ensure she learned things properly.

Moments came where we filled in some small talk. 

“If you don’t mind me asking, why not work at a grocery store? This is twelve hour shifts.”

“Since my sweet Michael passed, I’ve been lonely . My kids haven’t came to see me in a while. I figured some extra money couldn’t hurt. Plus I need some new hobbies and ways to occupy time.”

She pulled out her phone to show the picture of her and her husband hugged up on a beach shore. She then showed a few pictures of her kids.

She told me some things about her husband and we talked about many other things during the few hours. 

My boss came up to me and asked if I could speak in his office. I followed him Into his concrete cube.

“Word has made it to me that you guys haven’t been working and playing on the phone.” He looked at my sternly.

“Woah now, she did pull out her phone. But it was just because she showed me a picture of her deceased husband.”

“I understand, but we do have a policy about phones. I don’t want the wrong manager to catch that or her think it’s normal.”

“I understand.”

I closed the door on my way out and cussed under my breath. I knew for a fact Jacob was involved. 

I walked back to my area and Macy asked what happened. I looked over my shoulder and seen Jacob peaking my way. 

“Someone claimed to see you on your phone. You aren’t in any trouble though. But I do advise you be careful of your actions around some people.”

She nodded her head. “Which one.”

“The one in the camo hat over there.”

We worked a while longer before it was break time. She told me she was gonna go to her car.

“Macy, don’t worry about Jacob, snakes will be snakes.”

I walked by him on my way to the break room.

“That’s cute what you did.”

He looked up at me, “what are you talking about?”

“You know.”

“I’m not allowed on my phone, not sure why Grandma is. Also, I don’t want you breaking the retaliation policy.”

I walked off without saying another word.

Once our break was over she came back full of happiness . She worked a while and was learning the job.

I heard another  woman nearby screaming. A handful of us came running over to her and she pointed down.

“A snake crawled under that toolbox.”

Someone pushed the tool box and a coworker grabbed a shovel. It slithered out and the man with the shovel chopped it up.

It felt weird, I’ve seen birds fly in from bay doors, rats, bugs, never a snake.

I walked back over to Macy and she grabbed her things up. 

“Mikey, I think you’re right. I believe I’d be better off at a grocery store.”

“Macy, I hope it wasn’t because of the phone thing. Difficult coworkers are everywhere.”

“Oh no deary, it’s like you said. Snakes will be snakes. I just love my special hobby so much and will find work elsewhere.” She giggled.

I went to go find my boss and let him know she walked out to security to sign her paper. 

No one could find Jacob. His line was backed up and security had no swipe log  of him leaving.

I just feel really scared right now and need advice.
