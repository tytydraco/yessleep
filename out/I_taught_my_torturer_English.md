My name is Amani, I am South African, I look white, and can only speak English.



In 2014, I had to go to Syria on a humanitarian mission my church was having, we were supposed to help set up tents, give away food, make refugees forget about the war for a bit, and of course spread the gospel.

The first few weeks there were as horrible as you could imagine, watching children whose parents were missing, and those who lost limbs as their dreams were buried with them, and of course, the crimes that would go unstopped, but after some time, I got used to it and just had to keep on pushing through.



On July 2nd, I was out of the camp with my group, we had gotten reports of an injured group that was immobile, they needed a small camp set up near them until specialized medics got there, it was then that me and my friends were stopped by the police at a check point, at the time I did not understand what happened; but found out later that our local guide volunteer probably had his name in their lists as a wanted terrorist, he tried to argue but was immediately taken out of the vehicle and beaten until he was unconscious.

As for us, they saw a bunch of foreigners, I was the only white person, the rest of the people in the car were black, and I must assume racism worked in their favor, as they opened my door, yanked at my shirt to get out of the car, and took me away.



After a few hours in holding, I was questioned by a man who didnt speak a word of English, they didnt think to bring up a translator or even open up google translate, but through just gestures and a lot of punches and slaps, they understood that I was here to help the camps, and that I wasn’t really a rich person at all, and that I was a Christian, I can only assume they wanted to hold me for ransom.



I can tell they didn’t know what to do with me, but I was hopeful that maybe my friends will send some help, assuming they didnt meet the same fate I was in, unfortunately, the next day, I was woken up by a kick to the stomach, pulled by my shirt into a car, and sent downtown before they could come.



I was very relieved when we pulled up near a big building, had a lot of flags on it, did not look like a prison at all, even more so when I went inside it was clear it was a judicial office, I was put inside a courtroom with a lot of other people, and one by one we were taken up to a judge, he would be handed a file, read it for a few seconds, ask a question or two to the accused, and then slap his hammer, I couldn’t understand what was going on, but I was hoping when I talk to him this will all be solved, I had nothing to do with the revolution, I had no issues with the regime, I just wanted to help some children.



I get pulled up by my shirt again and pushed towards the judge, he says something in Arabic that I don’t understand, and I take this opportunity to confess my innocence in English, hoping that anyone in the courtroom can understand or at least get a translator.



“My name is Amani, I am from South Africa, I am only here to help, please I did nothing, I have nothing to do with the revolution or the terrorists, I only wanted to help those who were injured” I begged and pleaded.



The judge looked around the room, said something in Arabic, people seemed puzzled, I can only assume he asked if anyone understood me, but nonetheless he asked me “You America?”, I didn’t understand at first, he repeated “You from America? You United states?”

I said “No” and shook my head, he took a few seconds staring at me, then he hit his hammer, and I was taken away, that was the last I saw of the outside world for the next 4 years.



Being in prison, I didnt understand a word the guards told me, I got beat at every command, eventually, I just memorized the basic commands “Get up” “Come here” “Go to the shower”, but there still were times where I didn’t understand what was asked of me, and was beaten until I somehow did, the guards after some time started recognizing me, and instead of just yelling the command, they would come up to me and pull me by my shirt like a child playing with their pillow, this was my situation for about 4 months, I don’t want to go into the details of what they fed us or what was our schedule, because I don’t want anything to overshadow the horrible things I am about to convey.



One day my cell was opened, and I was called, this was very unusual, even if they were going to ask me to do something they would just yell a command like we were some kind of sheep herd, but this time someone actually asked me by my name to come, I guess they didn’t want to bother telling the other prisoners in the cell to sit down.



I was taken to a room that I had never been in before, the opening didn’t even have a door, it was just a hole in the stone,  my rough estimate is it was a 4x4 room, with two chains on the floor at opposite sides, the room had a window that was facing outside the prison, I was sat down on one side, and waited for some time before anyone came to check in on me or give me any food or water or even just a shirt, this was probably in December, and I thought I would die from freezing.



Then “Abo Jeldah” came, that was a name I heard a lot, of course at the time I didn’t know who he was or what he did, but being stuck I had nothing better than trying to learn Arabic from my cellmates talking, and “his name is Abo Jeldah” was a common phrase that I understood, it was a phrase told to any new prisoners that ended up in our cell, after they arrive they get sat down, and a welcoming counsel would explain to them how they can survive this prison, and how to make the guards happy.



Abo jeldah came, and he seemed only to want to make sure I was in the room, and he saw me shaking and freezing, he yelled something at the top of his lungs at a prison officer, and I could hear them running, after a few seconds a guard put down a blanket on me, gave me some food, and some water, it was better than the rotten food I normally ate in the cell, I couldn’t believe it, but I had no intention of questioning it, he didn’t say a word to me, and I remember that was a very happy day for me.



I had told myself “Maybe they realised im not a terrorist or a revolutionary, maybe they are trying to make me look ok so I can get out, maybe a translator or one of my friends finally came and they wanted to talk to me” they were all lies of course, if that were the case I knew there was a different protocol for that, while I was in the big cell with the others when some one was getting out they would be given some clothes and they would be hugged and told to memorize the names of everyone in their cell so they can tell their families they are ok, and to memorize those who were executed to tell them the bad news, but for me, they just took me like they would if I was going to take a shower.

Abo jeldah came back after some time again, but this time there was another prisoner, they chained him up on the opposite side of me, they were in their underwear, crying profusely, their body had marks from head to toe.



Abo jeldah gave me a piece of paper, it said *“I want to learn English, they said you are a native speaker, I will try to say what I am doing in English, and you have to correct me, if you don’t I will make sure you regret it.”*

I looked up at him, and he said *“You understood?*”, I shook my head up and down, and got slapped in the face, I had been slapped a lot ever since I got here, but for some reason, this was the worst one, it was probably the combination of the cold and the betrayal, after thinking he was my savior, it turns out he was my torturer. *“I said correct me, it is Did you understand, you piece of shit!  I will always test you, next time I won't be as gentle”* he said after spitting on me, I could tell it was a practiced speech, it had an unnatural rhythm, and the letters came out wrong, but I understood that he didn't care about that, he just wants to be able to communicate.



*“You no talk”* he said this as he went to the other prisoner, I hesitated to correct him or not, then all I saw was white as he turned back and kicked me in the face, *“I said correct me!”*

It seemed that was another test, but from then on I never hesitated.



Abo jeldah and the prisoner were speaking Arabic, the prisoner crying and begging and Abo jeldah seemed compassionate, speaking in a soft low voice and petting the prisoner, after some time of this my mind ignored them and started to wonder what is he going to say for me to correct him any way? Wouldn’t it be better if I gave him basic lessons like introducing himself or something? But I got my answer, and I wish I didnt.



*“Now I cut his finger off”* his words pierced my brain, I didn’t want to get hit again for not correcting him, but what he said froze me, he looked back at me, holding his knife, and saw my eyes almost popping out of my head, and the terrified look in my eye, he just laughed, head to the sky, jaw open larger than I’ve ever seen anyone my whole life, his teeth went past his lips, I could only describe him looking as a real monster, it was a terrifying sight.



*“I grab knife”* \- “I will grab the knife”,  *“and cut finger”*\- “and cut his finger off”, *“Will be big pain”* \- “Will be very painful”, *“He cry”* \- “He will cry”. After a few seconds, he turned to me and said *“You Cockroach!”*, I guess I was correcting him too much, maybe his ego wouldn’t allow him to handle someone correcting him, but he never beat me when I did, he would just insult me saying “You cockroach” or “You dog”, trying to put me in my place.



And from then on that was my life, I would get my own food and water, which was better than the things I got in the cell, and every day someone would come and be tortured, all while he narrated every step of the way.



*“I feed salt”* \- “I will feed him salt”, *“Then I drink him water”*  “Then I will make him drink water”, *“Then I will tie his penis”* \- “”, *“good I got it right, then I wait for…”* I didn’t know what he was waiting for, he was snapping his fingers trying to think of the words, it was then that I understood, I said “Then I wait for his bladder to burst”, he jumped up like I just solved a puzzle he was thinking about, *“Yes, bladder to burst”.* 



*“I place big water here”* \- “I will place a big water bucket here”, *“I wait for him to die!”*  \- “I will wait for him to die”



And so the next few days were me, looking at this poor soul, as he was force-fed salt every few hours, and had to fight to drink from the water near him because he knew there was no going back, they never fed him anything else so he couldn’t even puke or mix the water with something, and he was yelling in pain for far longer than I thought was possible.



I went through hundreds of torture sessions, and tens of executions, I never wanted to count, I never wanted the burden of having to remember their names to tell their families their fate, but I had nothing else to do, I would just day in and out between torture session repeat their names, and the method of death.



Abo jeldah gradually started speaking better English, every time he would do something new I would need to correct him again, but for the routine fingernail or tooth pulling, he was speaking perfectly, but I still had to pay attention in case he tested me, he never wanted to say anything other than what he was doing… it was like he was preparing for a presentation, and he started to notice that I was not correcting him as often, so every few weeks he would come up with something new… something he can learn from… and those poor souls will forever haunt me, I still remember them:

  


Mohammed J. - *“I will stick rod into his ass to mouth so he eat his shit”* \- “I will stick a rod up his ass until it comes out of his mouth so he can taste his own shit”

Mustafa S. - *“I will give knife and leave hungry, so he can only eat or kill himself”* \- “I will give him a knife, leave him hungry, so his only options are to either eat himself or kill himself

”

Zafer B. - *“I will pour cold water so he freeze, then I pour on him with alcohol and give him a lighter so he try to get warm”* \- “I will pour cold water on him so he freezes, then I will douse him with alcohol and give him a lighter so he can try to get warm.”



I was worried if I didn’t find any corrections for some time that I would be placed back in the other cell, I had food and warmth here, I had rotating company, I did not want to leave, But it turns out I had nothing to worry about, and he proved that with Khaled M, even though I saw all of those brutal executions and tortures, somehow he was the one that still haunts me, I see him in my nightmares a lot, I’ve never seen anyone other than him in my nightmares.



*“Wake up, we have new visitors here”* \- “” , this time it was two people, this was a first, it was a man in his 40’s or 50’s, which was a very rare sight for this hell, and a young man who couldn’t be older than 23, and this time they weren’t chained, but there were a lot of guards.



*“I will make them undress until naked”* \- “I will make them undress until they are naked”

 I thought this was normal, being stripped to get cold was standard for any torture.

*“I will make dad go on his knees, with his hands on the wall”* \- “I will make the dad go on his knees with his hands on the wall”

*“I will make his son slap him in the ass”* \- “I will make his son slap him on the ass”

*“Then I put my gun on the son’s head, and make him fuck his daddy until he finish”*, I had been here for several years, and seen some horrible things, but the same shock I had the first time I saw him cut a few fingers off came back on my face.



*“You like this? I thought of this just for you, there will be many new words today, you better have attention”* \- “You better pay attention”



Arabic yelling and screaming followed, crying and pleading and beating, but, just like the others, they complied, I am crying trying to remember them as I write this, but the world needs to know what I saw, 



*“I cut dad penis off, and feed it to his son”* \- “I cut the dad’s penis off, then feed it to his son”

*“I slap the son on the ass, so he can fuck harder like a horse*” - “”

*“I make his dad suck his penis, maybe that will help him finish”* \- “I make the dad suck his penis, maybe that will help”*“Come on, your whore mother sucked me better than this”* \- “”

*“Good job, make sure you swallow it all”* \- “”

*“Now I will make the son beat the dad to death if he wants to live”* \- “”



Lots of yelling and pleading again, but as always, he has to comply, I can tell the dad is trying to calm his son down, telling him to do it, telling him he loves him, I didn’t need to understand their language to know that is what was being said.

  
  


*“Time to clean this up, you need to correct me more, or next time it will be your turn”* \- “”



I was terrified, through all of these years, he did learn English, he knew how to talk to me, I am sure he did his own research at home because there were a lot of words I never taught him, I did not know what would happen to me, but luckily for me, he just kept coming up with new methods, new ways to say the same thing, and he started having some small talk with me, anything from the weather to the news to what I think of the prison, I never gave truthful answers but he never cared, he once asked me *“Do you know what my name means? Abo jeldah?*” - “No I don’t, what does it mean?”, *“It means one who skins, I love it, can you believe I did not come up with this name, the prisoners did it themselves…”* I could tell he had a thought that cut through his words.



*“Now thinking about it, I don’t think I’ve ever skinned anyone in some time, I know some of my friends like to do it often but I always thought it was too dirty”* 



*“Tell me, what new words would I learn if I am going to skin someone?”* I thought about it, but I couldn’t come up with anything, he knew what skin meant, blood was a common thing, pain, technique, I could not come up with anything he has not already mastered saying, I was terrified that I won’t be useful to him anymore.



“I don’t know, I have never seen anyone be skinned before”

*“Aww this is not okay! You saw all of the ways except for skinning? It is a very common way, I will show you tomorrow!”*



The next day came, and I was taken out of my chains and told to follow a guard, I started thinking “Today is the day, I am the one being skinned, this is it.”



They took me to an outside field, I thought it was dirt but when my toes dug into it I discovered that it is sand that has had so much blood spilled on it that it looked like dirt instead, I was made to walk to the opposite side of the field, about 20 meters or so, and then some prisoners in a chain gang were placed inside the field, and ordered to run in laps, a wooden plank was brought and stuck on the ground and vertically hammered in place, it was then that Abo jeldah came, everyone was terrified of him, he walked up to me and said *“No need for corrections today, I want to give you a show!”*

He stopped the gang, unchained the first prisoner, and ordered the rest to keep running again, I realized that I recognized this prisoner, he was our local guide that was driving us to the injured people, I couldn’t do or say anything, he ordered our guide to the ground, put each arm and leg in a different chain so he was spread apart, and started skinning him, this time I looked away because there was no need for correcting, and he seemed to be completely taken by the action that he didn’t acknowledge me or anyone else.



The rest of the prisoners knew what their fate was, but being exhausted they had no chance of fighting back or escaping, and slowly but surely they were starting to slow down, and trip a lot, all were followed by beatings of course, they kept this up for a few hours until Abo jeldah came to me and said *“Now you have seen a skinning, it is such a slow and bad way to kill someone, it will make them in pain for a long time, but it will make you so dirty, I have so much pig blood on my clothes”*



Not even a second had passed that he yelled in Arabic for them to stop, pulled out his gun, and shot them one by one in the line, everyone was too exhausted, barely had enough energy to be standing up, to the point that when he had to reload his gun he just gave it to a prisoner as he got his bullets out, would thank the prisoner and continue until they were all dead.



*“There was a lot of old people that we needed to kill, is that correct?”* “They are not old”

*“I mean they are here from long time ago, we just did not have time to execute them”*

“You can call them late people”

*“Yes that is better, they were late, and they are not people, they are pigs”*

  


Abo jeldah said something to the other guards in Arabic, and then took me with him to an office, sat me down on the other side of the desk and sat on his side



*“I never asked you why you are a terrorist, you don’t speak Arabic”*

I was confused and surprised, for the first time ever I am being asked what I was doing in this prison

“I am not, I was just here to help children, no one I talked to could speak English so I was placed here”

*“Really? I never looked at your file, I assumed you were a spy or you are a terrorist, wait here”*

He left me, I was not chained to anything, I thought a lot about running away, but I knew there was no way I was going to make it out, I waited for about 30 mins until he came back 

*“You piece of shit, why did you not tell me your name?”*

I never realised it, but he never asked me for my name, and I guess he never bothered remembering it from when he brought me to the torture chamber, he never asked me anything, he always thought I was just a cockroach.

“I am so sorry, my name is Amani”

*“Amani? So you are an Arab?”*

“No! I am from south africa”

*“Amani is an Arab name”*

“I swear I am not, I don’t know any Arabic”

*“Ok wait here”*

This time he was gone for a few hours, and I could do nothing but pray and stare at the wall.

He returned with someone who did not seem to be a police officer, and they started pointing at me and speaking Arabic, next thing I knew, I was on the other side of the torture room.



*“Are you working with the revolutionaries, I am take your thumb”*

“No I am not please!”

A snap, and a shock went through my hand.

*“I told you to correct me! Now look what you made me do”*

“Please I have nothing to do with this”

*“Hmm maybe we will ask your toe”*

Another snap, shock, but this time the pain was from my foot.

“I am begging you, I just came from South Africa to help refugees, I don’t care about anything else”

*“Maybe you are a spy! I think a tooth is a good indicator”*

“No Please I am not!”

I said while he had his hand in my mouth, but I knew from watching him for years that it didnt matter, I could all but confess and he would do this, it was just a routine to him, but it was the first time he did the interrogation in English, I assume he thought of it as a final exam for himself.

*“Okay, I am going to run you through the internal affairs, if you turn out to be lying to me, I will invent a new method on you, and you know it will be horrible”*

“I am sorry please please believe me”

*“Stop crying, fucking cockroaches, you are all the same”*



A few days passed by, no one else was brought into the room, I did get a single serving of food and water, I barely survived with it, but after all this time, I was given the leaving prison routine, I was given clothes, a good amount of food, and while eating Abo jeldah came



*“You tell any one what happened here, I will come to you, I already found your family in South Africa, and if this ever comes out I am coming for them personally”*

“Yes yes thank you I understand I am so sorry”



And that was the case, up until the revolutionaries took back the prison a few months ago, I obsessed over videos of it, information of what guards were caught, what guards were free, but I saw it, I saw them catch Abo jeldah, and he was crying like a child.



I was still scared to write this for some time, scared he would come and hunt me down regardless, but I feel I owe it to those I saw suffer.



I have contacted the family of any name I could remember, and most of them did not realize their child was even imprisoned let alone executed.



I hope the Syrian people will find peace, and I hope the pain they caused is used as fuel to spread love and peace.
