It's 2:46 on a warm but dark summer night. I'm at the stop waiting for the late-night bus. Don't ask why I'm here, I shouldn't be up right now anyway.

The bus is here. I board it, greet the driver who also nods back. There's like 2 other people on here, which is fairly usual for this time. I go sit on the last row. The bus starts driving off.

I'm a little drowsy, but I'm trying not to fall asleep, because I don't want to miss my stop...the next bus back would be 3 hours later. 

I'm scrolling on my phone as usual, but I notice the battery is getting low so I activate super power saving mode and try to avoid using it too much.

Since I can't really watch my phone, I look out of the window to keep myself somehow entertained and awake. Everything seems normal to my half-asleep brain. So far, anyway.

The bus hasn't stopped in a while, which is a bit weird but maybe there just aren't that people up at this time, especially in these outer suburbs.

I take a look out of the window as we're approaching a stop to see if anyone is there. The only face I see is the one on an advertisement poster plastered onto the wall of the shelter. Apart from that, there's no life in sight.

Since I don't see anyone outside, I shift my focus onto the two riders inside. They don't seem to know each other and aren't sitting very close to each other either. They're both watching their phones, and unlike mine I think theirs actually has some charge. 

I wonder where they're going.

The next 10 to 20 minutes feels pretty monotonous and honestly I don't even remember much from it. I have a feeling we took some turns to places where we don't usually go to, but maybe I'm just tired and the busline could have changed routes a little, who knows. It's not enough to make me think that anything would be out of the ordinary, as most of the route does seem to go as it usually would.

One thing that does intrigue me however is the lack of stops. Infact, since I got on this bus we haven't stopped a single time to let anyone board or leave. I know that it's very late at night right now but usually when I ride this we do stop at least a couple times.

I decide to look out again as we're going past a stop. This time I actually see someone. He's holding his hand out trying to tell the driver to stop and let him in. But we don't. We're flying right past with seemingly no intention of picking him up. I watch from the rear window as he starts angrily chasing the bus while waving his hands but there's no help, and soon he gives up.

I honestly just find it a bit funny, maybe the driver just didn't see him. I do feel bad for him but it wasn't my fault so why should I care anyway.

At this point I'm really tired but I keep staring out of the window as if that would help me stay awake. I'm not sure but I think we went past a few more people without stopping or something I don't know..

...

..hm?

where am i?

oh yeah..

shit.

I just woke up. I had a good little nap for probably some half an hour. That's good in the sense that I'm not super tired anymore. Bad however in the sense that I have no clue where I am.

I told you I knew this bus route nearly by heart, but that was only till my home. After that I have never gone and I hoped that I would never have to either, at least because I missed my stop. 

I don't know what to do now. All I know is that the bus back would be in a few hours but I don't know where I am and quite frankly do not want to hop out of this bus in the middle of nowhere and hooe for the best. Besides, my ticket is on my phone which is on 2% right now. I'm not going to risk getting stranded here with no clue where I am and no way home.

I know that this bus line goes all the way to the centrum of the city, so I think I'll just stay on and go all the way there. Maybe I can charge my phone, or at best talk with some other people.

Speaking about other people, the two others are still on this bus with me. I guess I could go talk with them but I don't have anything to ask them right now anyway so why bother them.

..

How long is this ride taking? It's been what feels like an hour since I woke up and based on what I can see outside we're still not in the city.

The road is running through the middle of some huge field, I think they're growing wheat or something similar.

All of a sudden we stop. 

What the hell? I think to myself. This is the first time something really felt wrong to me during this ride. Why would we just stop in the middle of some field, when we hadn't even stopped at regular bus stops with people waving. 

The doors open. I see one of the people riding the bus just gets up and walks out. The other notices and follows.

Now it's just me sitting on the back row of a bus, all alone, in the middle of nowhere. There aren't even streetlights, but at least there's a light inside the bus. The driver closes the doors and I think we're about to continue, but we don't.

10 minutes pass and we're not moving. I'm starting to get impatient. I walk down to the cabin and ask the driver what are we waiting for. He doesn't react at all, as if I never even was there. There's a see-through plastic barrier between us but he should hear me through it, at least see me. I'm trying my hardest to get his attention, banging on the barrier with my fists like I'm trying to break it. Nothing works. 

I go back to my seat row and lay down across. I don't know how long I'm going to be here so I might as well just go back to sleep if I can. They'll come wake me up at the terminus probably.

I can't get sleep. I don't know how I did it before but this time it's just not working. 

All of sudden the interior lights go dark. I'm really confused and a little annoyed so I go to the cabin again, this time there's no one there. What the fuck.

I've always seen those emergency hammers on buses and wondered if I'd ever have to use one. Today might be that day. I grab the red hammer and hit the corner of the window. It shattered on the second hit, and I kicked it through the rest pf the way.

I hop out of the window and look around to see if I could still spot the people I had been riding with. Unsurprisingly, I didn't. 

I start walking down the road toward the direction the bus was going before it stopped. Then the bus turns on again behind me, and starts driving straight towards me. (I'm walking on the road itself as there is no sidewalk or other cars). I run out of the way and try to catch onto the back of it, but no, I failed.

I still have my phone. It's on 1%. According to it the time is 4:04 am. I have no idea what to do now.

I look around and all I see is a field extending until the horizon, only getting cut by a lone road. The only light is from the starry sky. There's slight fog which seems to be getting thicker.

I keep walking and I'm just praying to see another car or anything that could help me.

My phone is now dead. 

I lay down next to the road, and wait.
