[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1dmkxa4/i_was_trapped_in_a_pitch_black_room_it_turned_out/)

As I'm writing this down, I try to remember again how it felt to be sucked into the black hole, how the imagery around me was, and if it was left a mark on me. But just like dream, or rather a nightmare, it vanished from my memory.

What I remember, though, is that after being attacked by whatever that tentacle thing was, I found myself in a different place. It was still dark. I was afraid that I was lying in my pitch-black room again, but my eyes gradually got used to the ceiling light that shone the new room.

I looked down and saw that I was strapped to a hospital bed with leather straps. I could also feel a bandage on my head. I was no longer in the green hazmat suit nor was I stark naked but was wearing a patient gown that covered my private parts better than the rag I had to wear in the old room.

Panic shot through my head, but it only caused pain. I must’ve hit some hard object that caused the bandage.

I heard a voice in the background. It was female and mumbling something. I followed the voice to the other end of the room, where the outline of a person was visible behind a mat windowpane. She was holding a phone and talking. 

It didn’t take long before she got up and came into my room. She was tall, slim, and had a light brown perm that peeked out from under a nurse’s cap. Her nurse’s uniform was pretty skimpy. In general, her outfit was very brief and sexy, as if she had just returned from a college Halloween party.

She came to my bed and jotted something down on a clipboard, ignoring me.

“Where am I?” I said without hesitation. Despite her appearance, she seemed trustworthy. Maybe it was because she reminded me a little of my girlfriend Flo. 

“In the infirmary. For now”, she said monotonously. 

For now? Would she send me back to the room of darkness? Where I had made friends with someone who had probably been locked up there for weeks? Where my last known memory had been a surreal horror scenario in the diner with Flo and her brother Benny?

Then it dawned on me. Benny.

“Where’s Benny? What happened to him?” I shook myself around in the hospital bed desperately. The nurse recoiled slightly. She had a confused look on her face.

“Who’s Benny?” 

“My little … my girlfriend’s brother. Benny Palmer. Something happened to him Were you able to save him?” I felt a lump in my throat and wanted to cry, but I thought it was best to stay strong. 

The nurse flicked through the clipboard.

“There’s no Benny Palmer listed here. Only a Florence Palmer.”

I couldn’t believe my ears. “FLO! That’s my girlfriend, Flo! Is she here?”

“Calm down.” The nurse took a step back. “I’m not allowed to tell anyone anything about that. And especially not you.”

Her mood changed suddenly. For a split second I still had hope that she would help me, but judging by the look on her face, she would rather have me whipped.

“You’re lucky we even had a room free for you. If it were up to me, you would’ve been thrown back into the dungeon where you would rot for all eternity.”

“Why would you say that?”

“Are you serious? You killed one of our guards. He was just an apprentice and only 19 years old. Do you have even a hint of remorse?”

I was confused as to what she was talking about. Who could I have killed? My thoughts wandered back to the young man in the hazmat suit that I had locked up half-naked in my dungeon. I knew I’d been suffering from severe headaches since I woke up and the time in the dungeon had probably damaged my memory, but I was pretty sure I’d left the boy alive.

“I didn’t kill anyone, I swear”, I assured the nurse, even though it was pointless. 

“Then who did?” Her expression darkened. 

I swallowed hard as I saw her slowly approaching me, the clipboard put down. I tried desperately to somehow pull myself free from the straps, but I felt like a boa constrictor was crushing me. Next to me was a table with surgical instruments, including a pair of scissors. I twisted and pulled at my arms, trying to stretch them out and grab the scissors.

The nurse had reached my bed by now and was towering over me. She may have looked like Mary Jane, but she was as threatening as Green Goblin. I braced myself for the next blow. 

The sister fell on top of me, but as it turned out, not to attack me, but because she was *being* attacked. Behind her, someone grabbed her, croaked a loud scream, and hurled her across the room, where she slammed against a locker and lay motionless on the floor. 

My rescuer was a tall, strong guy with a bald head. He was wearing the same dirty garment I had worn in the dungeon. He stared at me, grinning.

“Brother, she was lighter than I thought.”

A rush of relief enveloped me, and I had to grin too. My dungeon neighbor had actually made it out.

He took the scissors from the table and cut the straps so I could stand up. It felt great to be able to stretch and breathe normally again.

My neighbor hugged me tightly and seemed relieved to see me too. 

“Thank you, man”, I said. 

“Call me Reeve.”

“Thank you, Reeve. How did you even get out?” I asked curiously.

“Long story, brother. To make it short, the little rookie who took over your dungeon played a big role in it.”

“He set you free?”

“That’s one way to put it.”

“I’m glad. The nurse said I killed him, and I almost believed it myself.”

“Nah, brother. You were still friendly with him. I did the rest.”

His last sentence made me prick up my ears. I pondered about what he meant by that until I had a dark idea.

“You killed him?”

Reeve put his hands on my shoulders. “If I hadn’t done it, you’d still be strapped down here and being tortured. Believe me, that’s what they do to you. They don’t shy away from anything.”

I nodded and tried to appear understanding. I told myself that the young guard had brought this on himself, that he had chosen such an inhumane profession.

“Let’s get outta here”, said Reeve, striding ahead.

I looked over at the nurse again, who was still lying on the floor. A pool of blood surrounded her head, which had slammed against the locker. 

“Do you think she’s still alive?” I asked curiously.

Reeve crouched down next to her and checked her pulse. He nodded slightly. But before I could make a suggestion as to how we could stop her from running off and telling on us, Reeve got there first. He grabbed the scissors and stabbed her.

There must’ve been about ten stabs, but I couldn’t quite tell at the time because the sight put in me in a trance-like state. The pool of blood grew larger, and the nurse’s clothes became redder. Reeve stood up, completely covered in blood.

“She won’t run away now.” 

Without saying anything else, Reeve left the hospital room with the scissors and waited for me. I stayed behind and processed the thought that the nurse was nothing but a holey corpse now. My gaze fell on the clipboard that was lying on the floor.

Flo. My consciousness became clear again now that I knew what my real goal was. Benny was probably still in this hell and Flo probably was too. 

I left the room and the two of us walked down another maze of hallways. Every now and then we looked into rooms that seemed to be empty and discovered more hospital rooms, operating rooms and cleaning closets. 

“If there’s an exit here, they’ve hidden it pretty well.”

We hid in a hallway so I could focus on the clipboard. I browsed through the documents. They were mostly records of people who were apparently being held here. Each person had personal information such as blood type, blood values, brain activity and something I didn’t quite understand: anomaly level.

I kept turning pages until I found Flo’s name. Her blood values seemed normal. Her anomaly level was 1. Whether that was a good or bad sign, I couldn’t tell. There were even a few notes about her:

 

*ANOMALY 23 refuses to eat.*

*ANOMALY 23 exhibits self-harming behavior (torn fingernails are found in food)*

*ANOMALY 23 repeatedly insists on meeting with ANOMALY 24*

 

I kept flipping through until. I found the record for Anomaly 24 (the documents were very disorganized). I thought it was me because the nurse said Benny was not listed, but I was wrong.

Anomaly 24 did not have a real name. The anomaly level was 100. He also had notes. Reading them made my neck hair stand up.

 

*ANOMALY 24 exhibits overreactions to medication --> tantrums, fidgeting, screaming fits*

*ANOMALY 24 is regularly sedated and force-fed*

*ANOMALY 24 does not respond to treatment methods --> tentacle arms appear at irregular intervals; last known appearance on Nov 10th at 6:36 p.m. during ANOMALY 25 attack on staff*

I shuddered to turn the page and find my record, because it was certain that I had one, and it was certain that Anomaly 25 was me. But it was necessary to find out everything so I could understand what had happened to the three of us.

My record showed my name and my anomaly level, which was 55. I also had some notes.

*ANOMALY 25 is the first anomaly to show signs of possession by tentacle arms*

*ANOMALY 25 escapes dungeon by murdering a guard on Nov 10th at 6 p.m.*

*ANOMALY 25 is cared for in infirmary after fainting* 

“Are you nearly done with this?” Reeve asked impatiently. “I’d really like to get out of here, brother.” 

I stopped reading and we left. Unfortunately, there was no floor plan among the documents, so we just wandered aimlessly, hiding from possible danger.

Eventually, we reached a door at the end of a hallway that seemed different from other doors. It was larger and had two handles. It was one of those entrances that you had to push hard to get into. 

We approached the door and saw a note attached to it. It said: *NEXT SHOWING ON DEC 1st AT 10:30 A.M.*

“Brother, is this a movie theater?” Reeve seemed very excited and forced the door open. I thought it was a bit reckless that he just walked in without considering that someone might be inside, but he was already gone. I followed him.

We were now in a room that actually resembled a small movie theater. There were comfortable seats lined up everywhere and in the front was a large white screen. In the center between the seats was a device that looked like one of those ancient movie projectors.

“While we’re dying in the dungeon, these asswipes are enjoying themselves at their finest”, Reeve muttered angrily as he studied the projector. He fiddled with the buttons until suddenly the film reels started to spin and a beam of light shone out of the device, projecting an image onto the screen.

“Jackpot!” Reeve shouted.

I was still a little suspicious, fearing that Hazmat people might storm in at any moment.

The film that was being shown was apparently a training video for the staff in this building (I’m keeping the name of this company secret for legal reasons). It was fairly new, although the sound and picture quality had seen better days. I finally focused on the content, because at some point a narrator’s voice reported on something other than the training of the staff. Simultaneously, stock images and videos were shown to support the content.

*“Now you are probably wondering what the reason for this induction is. What the reason for the construction of this building is.* 

*As you already know, the current pandemic is in full swing. Since Day X, as we call it for the sake of simplicity, several formerly human beings have been possessed by an extraterrestrial creature that, to the layman, appears to be a tentacle monster. In fact, our best scientists are still studying this creature in more detail so that they are fully aware of what humanity is dealing with. The origin of the creature is not yet known. We also cannot say what abilities this creature possesses. The possessed probably know that best. But we will come to that now.*

*We call the hosts possessed by the creature, who were formerly human, ‘anomalies’ and your biggest task is to keep these anomalies in the dungeons until a possible release can be guaranteed. The meantime, our researchers and doctors can use the opportunity to study the anomalies, operate on them if necessary and, if in doubt, eliminate them once and for all. In this case, we primarily include anomalies that have reached an level of over 50.*

*But even though this is a task that comes with a lot of responsibility and has the highest level of secrecy and security, I ask you no to freak out. Just don’t forget one thing:  you are still human. They are not.*

*Now let’s move on to the safety instructions.”*

I pressed the button that stopped the projector. It took me a moment to process what I had just seen. At the same time, my head hurt again, so I had to sit down.

“Are you okay, brother?”

I wasn’t feeling well at all. After what I had seen, my head was pounding so much that I felt like something wanted to come out. For a moment, I was terribly afraid that those tentacle arms might sprout out of me too. I didn’t want to imagine what torture that would be and how Benny must’ve felt when this fate had befallen him.

Then I remembered that Benny had an anomaly level of 100. And that I also had a level of over 50.

But my head wouldn’t allow these thoughts. It wouldn’t allow anything and tried to push something else to the forefront. It cracked and shook inside me until finally saw something else in front of me.

I felt like I was back in time. This time I was no longer in the diner with Flo and Benny. Neither was I at the point after we left the diner. I was much further back. Back to a time when I was younger. When I was still happy. When my brother Charlie was still alive. Oh no. Please don’t. Please just not here! Please! I was…”

“WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!”

I couldn’t go any further into this memory because a deafening scream clouded my mind.

I was back in reality. And I wished it was a dream world. A man in a hazmat suit stood in front of the door and held up a gun. I held up my hands. Reeve left them down.

Before I knew it, a shot went off and a bullet pierced my skull.
