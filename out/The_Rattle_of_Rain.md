Every disappearance from Ahote National Park has had these three things in common: each one happened during periods of heavy rainfall, all “eyewitnesses” claimed to hear a strange clicking noise around the time of the disappearance, and every missing persons case was closed without a single lead or even remote indication of what had happened — or at least this was what my friend Eric decided to tell us that first night in the park as we were all huddled around the fire.

“And the other hikers didn’t just hear clicking,” he said mischievously, dark shadows dancing across his face from the flames below, “that was only what happened last. The worst were the screams, desperate blood-curdling screams, and a series of deafening cracks that echoed through the forest like a whip.”

“Like a whip?” Hannah said, laughing.

“Y-yeah”, Eric replied, looking as if he had been severely wounded. “What?”

“No, nothing…yeah that’s *really* scary.”

“Oh I’m sorry. Do you want to tell the story?” 

“No no. Go ahead…” Hannah said, throwing her hands up innocently. The two of them had been dating for years and bantered like this quite commonly.

“Like I was saying,” Eric continued with a playful glare at Hannah, “others in the area apparently heard the victims’ screams before they vanished. And that’s not all…

“There was evidently some type of confusion amongst the surviving hikers as well, for some of them took days or even weeks to find their way out of the park following these disappearances. And these weren’t amateurs either; many of them were highly experienced, having traversed the trails dozens of times before. But that’s the thing…they said that the trails *weren’t even there*, that they had disappeared like the people who went missing. There were others that disagreed, saying that the trails had merely changed, and just as many who were actually convinced that years had passed since they had initially entered the forest and that the trails had become overgrown with the passing of time.

“Now, naturally, since the last disappearance was decades ago, people have had plenty of time to come up with a number of ridiculous theories about what happened here, but the only living people who *really* know what happened are the descendants of the Watomi tribe.

“You see”, continued Eric, glancing around at the nearby trees, “this area of Arizona used to be part of their Reservation, the Watomi that is, until about 100 years ago when the United States government decided to lay claim to it. According to the natives, the U.S. soldiers were determined to use any means necessary to annex their territory: ambushing the Watomi while they slept, chopping down entire sections of the forest to relocate them, starting controlled fires with the remaining trees to suffocate them; and in the end, it worked. After 12 hard-fought years the Watomi were forced to relocate to Black Mesa.

“But those in the Watomi tribe were not of a forgiving nature. They were a proud people, with a long history of seeking vengeance towards those who had wronged them. Yes, they lost the war, but they managed to capture a number of U.S. hostages after many of the battles, and as a matter of retribution, performed a kind of horrific ritual with them.

“One by one the hostages were tied to a stake, their skin decorated with tar and oil to represent the bark of the nearby Aspens, and one by one they were chopped apart as if their limbs were the branches of a tree. The natives danced around them as they suffered, singing a series of harsh guttural words, laughing as the hostages bled slowly to the forest floor, but they didn’t kill them. No…not then anyway. Like I said, the Watomi were not the forgiving type, and the U.S. military had not only cut down their trees, they had burned them as well. The blood that had fallen to the stacks of wood below was now used as fuel, and as the flames rose slowly up to the stumps of the victims, the Watomi chanted their song even louder, joining their voices to the terrible anguished screams that rang out into the night sky.”

Hannah seemed to have no criticism for Eric’s storytelling now. She remained completely silent, and for a long moment there was no sound but the crackling of the fire. Even Jazz, Eric and Hannah’s tan-and-white sheepdog, was making no noise. Finally, my own girlfriend Courtney seemed to voice what the rest of us were thinking.

“Jesus Christ. That’s terrifying.”

“And I’m not even done.”

“Okay, well get a move on then”, said Hannah, only half-playfully.

“Once the ritual was over”, Eric said, giving Hannah the side-eye, “and the U.S. soldiers were now nothing but ash, they were each-“

But the rest of us never heard what happened next, because at that exact moment Jazz ran away from the fire, barking madly.

“Hey!”, yelled Eric. He stood, put his fingers to his mouth, and *whistled*. “Jazz!”

“Here boy!” yelled Hannah.

Courtney and I followed them through the dark wood to where Jazz, for some odd reason, was barking wildly at a tall Aspen tree. There was an image carved into its trunk: a single eye, large and lidless, leering out at us all. 

Hannah knelt down and began to pat Jazz on the head. “There we go…it’s alright…good boy.” She looked up at Eric. “What the hell is that thing?”

“I have no idea”, Eric replied, staring at the eye-carving, but I could tell that he wasn’t being entirely truthful. He looked to be shaken by something.

After Jazz finally calmed down and we were able to return to the campsite, the others were ready to hear the end of Eric’s story, but he clearly didn’t want to tell it anymore. Courtney and Hannah protested for a while, but I didn’t say a word. I thought I could tell where the story was heading anyway, and I didn’t want to think about that.

The next day passed by rather uneventfully, that is until something happened that Eric said hadn’t happened at Ahote National Park for decades: it began to pour. This seemed to have some type of euphoric effect on other hikers in the area, who all appeared to be moving through the trees in the same direction — laughing and drinking and singing.

“Upper Ahote Falls”, Eric clarified, “It hasn’t been active since the late 60’s.”

And so we joined the thronging crowd…up Pleasant Valley…along Soldiers Trail and through Crescent Pass…until we finally reached an enclosed area that looked like the end of a very large stone hallway. It was packed with people, all of whom seemed to be looking up at the sheer cliff-face at its opposite end. There was a trickling of water coming down from its top, and people were taking fake showers underneath and splashing their friends.

The rain, which had lessened to a light pattering during our hike up, suddenly decided to unleash itself again, and the passage was bombarded by a torrential downpour. Everyone took shelter under the eaves of the overarching cliffs, huddled together and talking excitedly as the flow of the falling water strengthened. And then, as if someone had lowered a dam wall up above, a sudden surge of water came rushing over the cliff and the waterfall sprang back to life. There was a tumultuous uproar — cheering and clapping and singing from every direction — and many people went out to dance in the rain.

It took a couple of hours for the weather to die down again, and once it did we decided to navigate our way back to the campsite we used the night before, but there appeared to be some type of confusion.

“It should be here”, Eric said, looking down at his map dubiously. “This doesn’t make any sense.”

Alone and in the thick of the forest again, with the encroaching darkness of night upon us, the joy of the afternoon had seemed to evaporate. The going had been rough, and after treading carefully down the mud-soaked slopes of the valley for hours, it looked as if we had now lost the trail.

“It’s like the story from last night”, Hannah suggested.

“Don’t”, said Eric. He clearly wasn’t in the mood for that. “We’ll be fine. We must have stepped off the trail somewhere back there.”

“It’s getting dark though. We won’t make it back even if we find the trail.”

“What do you suggest then? We just camp here?” Eric looked around at the small clearing with an unsavory expression.

“Well what else are we going to do?”

“What do you think?”, asked Eric, looking directly at *me* now. Hannah appeared to be signaling me with her eyes, trying to communicate wordlessly for me to agree with her. The rain was getting heavier.

“It’s as good as any other place we’ll find”, I responded.

And so we set up camp. After finally managing to insert the stakes into the damp earth, Courtney and I retired to our own tent in an effort to get some rest, but when I fell asleep I proceeded to have the strangest dream I can ever remember having…

…I was laying on the forest floor, but it wasn’t wet anymore. It wasn’t even made of dirt. Something was moving beneath me — squiggling underneath my back and down below my legs. I turned and saw to my horror that I was laying on a bed of large coiling snakes, writhing wildly and slithering in and out of one another. I tried to stand and run, but I couldn’t. They were wrapping themselves around my torso, trying to drag me under. And then there was the sound of a dog barking, and the snakes suddenly released me to slither over to a small figure off in the distance. It was Jazz! The snakes moved quickly — circling all over his body until he disappeared entirely from view — and the frantic barking turned instead to a series of high desperate *yelps.* The snakes then waved their tails at me menacingly, filling the forest with their terrible *rattles*…

…I was jolted suddenly awake.

“Aaron. Aaron! Wake up!” Courtney was sitting up in the tent, looking around nervously. I could tell that the rain had stopped, but there appeared to be a great deal of commotion going on outside.

“What is it?!”

“I think it’s Jazz!”

There was a panicked yelping noise coming from somewhere outside the tent, and then…

*CRACK.*

The yelping turned into a high painful *squeal*, and then resumed, faster and louder than before. Eric and Hannah could be heard yelling outside.

“Where is he?!”

“I don’t know…Jazz! Oh my god, Eric listen to him. Eric…”

“It’s okay. He’ll be alright…Jazz! Jazz!!”

*CRACK.*

The yelping became even higher-pitched, but it was softer this time, as if there wasn’t much voice left.

Courtney and I unzipped the tent door and hurried outside just in time to see Hannah and Eric rushing off into the darkness. We followed as quickly as we could. 

Jazz could be heard up ahead…we were getting closer…we were nearly there…

*CRACK.*

The yelping stopped.

Courtney and I reached the edge of a small hollow, where Eric and Hannah had now stopped and were scanning every inch of their surroundings. A few of the nearby trees had eyes carved into them.

“JAZZ! JAZZ!!”

“Jazz where are you?! Jazz!!”

But there was no other sound to be heard, nothing, except…

Starting slow and soft, and then building with a series of ever increasing *clicks*, was an unnerving *rattling noise*. It seemed to be coming from the air itself, growing and swelling to a deafening peak before ebbing away again, slowly and softly, fading back to silence.

Hannah was visibly shaking. “Oh my god…Eric…Eric did you hear him? He sounded like…like he was…” There were tears streaming down her face.

“I know.” Eric pulled her close and wrapped his arms around her, still looking around in every direction. “I know.”

As Hannah cried against Eric’s chest, Courtney grabbed my hand and leaned her head onto my shoulder. We waited there in silence, and though I couldn’t see her face, I knew that we were both crying as well.

After a long and unsuccessful search of the nearby trees, we all tried to return to our tents, but then something happened that was somehow weirder than anything else that had happened up until that point…our campsite seemed to be missing.

“Where is it?”

“I don’t know.”

“Are you sure it was here?”

“Yeah…that rock was there before.”

“But that doesn’t make any sense.”

“None of this makes any sense.”

We were definitely in the same small clearing where we had set up camp, but it was as if someone had stolen all of our stuff while we were off looking for Jazz.

“Look, we need to find shelter”, Eric said after a few minutes of panicked conversation. “It’s starting to rain again, and…and whatever’s out here…”

“But we don’t know where the trail is”, I reminded him.

“It doesn’t matter. We just need to head uphill. There were cabins on our way down here. We just have to retrace our steps.”

But there were no steps to retrace. The rain had turned all the dirt to mud, and what was worse…the ground remained as flat as ever. We traveled through an endless plain of trees until, somehow, by some stroke of good luck, we came upon a shelter. 

“I’ve heard about these”, said Courtney. “I think they’re first come first serve. I wonder if anyone’s in there.”

Though the shelter was empty, there seemed to be a great deal of miscellaneous items strewn all about the place: flashlights and matches and water bottles and canned food. There were also some sleeping bags on the shelter’s flat hardwood floor, and something else that interested me more than any of the other items…

On a small wooden desk in the corner was a travel log. If you don’t know what a travel log is, try to think of a guest book at an Airbnb, but instead of a notebook filled with comments about home decor and local restaurants, imagine a jointly-owned diary where dozens of travelers describe their experiences while hiking in the park. They’re usually a much more interesting read than a guest book as well — often involving fun drawings, song lyrics, and even tips for navigating the surrounding area — but this was by far the most interesting travel log I had ever read. As rain pounded against the shelter roof and the others tried to get the fireplace going, I lost myself in its pages.

There were a number of crude hyper-realistic drawings: a bear eating a woman alive, a man’s screaming head poking out of a roaring campfire, another man in various states of agony as leaves and twigs and branches sprouted from his skin. There were also pages upon pages of odd schizophrenic ramblings, strange runic symbols, an entire page that had nothing but a tiny scrawl of words in its center that read “Ahote = the restless ones”, and another page with an unsettling cryptic poem. The last four words were underlined:
      
*”Twice born in sunlight, and once born in bone,
The victimless victims grow harder than stone,
For those who survived through the battle were slain,
And death calls again with the rattle of rain.”*

I wanted to show the others, but I knew it wasn’t the right time. Before I put the travel log down, however, I noticed one last drawing: Native American warriors, spears in their hands, running alongside a dog that looked identical to Jazz. It had the same bodily shape and the same tan-and-white coat.

I don’t remember crawling into one of the sleeping bags, and I don’t remember falling asleep, but I must have, for when I opened my eyes I was lying on the shelter floor and there was a soft tapping noise echoing in my head. It was growing slower and slower, eventually fading away to complete silence. I immediately pushed myself up onto my side.

Lying next to me, and also appearing to have just woken up, were Hannah and Eric. Courtney was nowhere to be found.

“Where is she?”, I asked hurriedly, but there was no response. Eric looked just as confused as I was, and Hannah was staring at me as if she’d seen a ghost. I jumped to my feet and ran out of the shelter.

The pale light of dawn was shimmering through the trees, and though the forest was quite dim, I could still see them — the eyes. Every tree in my line of sight had that same symbol carved into them, the one from the previous two nights, and every one of them was pointed directly at the shelter. The gloom of the morning played with my vision, casting a light veil over the etchings and giving the impression of shifting disfigured faces. 

My voice caught in my throat. “C-Courtney…”

Eric was outside now as well, shouting into the forest, and Hannah was standing right next to me. She looked to be rooted to the spot in fear.

“You don’t think…” I managed to utter to her, “that…that she…”

“No.” Hannah grabbed my arm assuringly. “Aaron *no*. She’ll be fine okay? We’ll find her…we just have to-“

“Ah!”, yelled Eric suddenly, “What the fuck?!” He had now stopped shouting for Courtney, and instead appeared to be struggling with something over at the edge of the wood.

“Eric?” Hannah said, letting go of my arm to approach the spot where he stood. “Eric what’s wrong?”

I approached as well, only to see that Eric’s foot looked to be stuck under a tree root.

“I must have walked right into it”, he said, grimacing. He tried to dislodge himself, but wasn’t able to move.

“Wait up…I’ve got you.” I knelt down and tried to pull his foot out myself, and then attempted to hoist him up around the waist in an effort to lift him straight out of it. Nothing seemed to work.

“What the hell is this?”, he said, a note of panic in his voice now. 

The morning was growing brighter. The rain clouds that had loomed overhead for the past 24 hours appeared to be taking a slight reprieve, and as golden rays of light shone upon the ground, I saw something so unbelievable that I almost fell over in shock…

The tree root, which was already wrapped tight around Eric’s foot, was now tightening its grip even further. Thin wooden fingers were sprouting slowly out of the mud and slithering all over his ankle — wrapping his lower leg in tight coils. Hannah let out an ear-splitting *scream.*

Shaking, I once again tried to hoist him up around the waste, but nothing was working, and what was worse was that he now seemed to be sinking.

“What is this?!”, he asked, his voice quivering. “What’s happening?!!”

“I don’t know. It’s…” I had him wrapped around the torso, pushing against the ground with all my strength. “It’ll be fine…”

“Get him out of there!”, Hannah yelled, horror-struck. “Aaron please get him out of th-“

*CRACK.*

“AHHHHHHH!” Eric let out a terrible anguished scream, and I looked down to see that his lower leg was now bent up at a harsh angle. His shin had been snapped completely in half and his foot was sticking out of the mud right next to him. It was twisting in on itself, attached to the rest of his body now by nothing but splintered bones and loose tangled skin. He was shouting out in pain. “FUCK!! HELP ME!!”

But the tips of the roots that had circled his leg were now slithering towards me, and instinct took over.

I fell backwards into the mud and crawled away as quickly as I could, barely managing to escape the root-ends nipping at my ankles. By the time I stood back up, Eric was almost waist deep in the earth.

MAKE IT STOP!! PLEASE MAKE IT STO-“

*CRACK.*

The portion of Eric’s body that was still visible tilted suddenly to one side. He was sinking slowly into the ground at an angle, the roots of the tree now wrapping themselves around his core. He was looking out at the two of us in pure fear, but no longer seemed to have the voice to yell.

Hannah was crying hysterically — making small motions to get closer and then backing away again.

I was jumping left and right, trying to find any way possible to approach. Eric’s arm was reaching out to me in one last-ditch effort to be saved, but it was no use. There was no safe ground. 

The bulk of Eric’s body was now completely hidden from view. The roots were tightening and tightening until…

*CRACK.*

Eric’s arm dropped suddenly to the ground, and his upper body hung limp and lifeless to one side. There was now nothing to be done.

Hannah fell to her knees, sobbing wildly, oblivious to the thin fingers that were sprouting out of the mud right next to her. 

I ran over and managed to drag her away just in time, pulling her back towards the shelter and away from the trees, and though I covered her eyes to make sure she couldn’t watch, I saw it — Eric’s head sinking slowly into the earth, the whites of his eyes looking right at us.

We fell to the shelter floor and huddled together in fear as the forest was filled once more with a series of unnerving *clicks.*

Hannah and I remained in that shelter for the next six days — shivering and crying in each other’s arms as the rain pounded against the roof. Every once in a while there were screams off in the distance, followed by that terrible rattling noise, but we never once looked. We barely moved, only getting up to use the restroom or to open a can of cold vegetables. 

By the second day we could hear helicopters passing by up above (the authorities must have been alerted to the disappearances) but no one ever showed up to the shelter, and eventually the sound of outside life faded away.

The rain stopped on the seventh day, and once I was confident that the ground was finally hard enough, I convinced Hannah that it was safe to leave.

When we stepped outside I could tell that the scenery was different. The looking-trees were much closer to the shelter than they were before, but they now seemed to be as solid as stone. We walked right past them, eventually found a steep hill, and climbed it to find the cabins that Eric had mentioned on that second night.

That was 26 years ago. Hannah and I have been with each other ever since, and now have two wonderful children. I guess when you go through something so traumatizing together it’s impossible for anyone else to understand you the same way that they do.

I’ve always held myself off from posting this story anywhere, as I’m fearful that no one will believe me, but I have no choice now. The weather channels are forecasting heavy rain in that area for the first time since 1998, and I don’t want what happened to us to happen to anyone else. So please! Before you go to Ahote National Park, please think about this story, think about what could happen to your loved ones, and think about that terrible and horrifying *clicking noise.* Think of *the rattle of rain.*
