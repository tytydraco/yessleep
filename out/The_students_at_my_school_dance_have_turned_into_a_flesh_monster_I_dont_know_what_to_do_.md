Every horror story starts out with a catching, horrifying line. This doesn’t, it isn’t horrifying nor is it scary. It is dreadful, it’s full of despair that I have to call reality. 

On May 15th was the night of one of ‘the most important dances’ which is just honestly overhyped in every high school movie.
prom was the event. 

I had picked out a dress and accessories last minute so I didn’t really look my best and it was already at a rough start without a date and just tagging along as a third wheel to my two friends who were a couple.

“Tonight will be fun, I’ll dance with you instead of him anyways.” My best friend smiled at me and cupped my cheek, blowing me a kiss. 

I smiled and pretended like I was going to lean into a kiss before laughing and her boyfriend just minded his own business driving the car, he was used to our flirtatious acts at this point. 
As we finally reached the location of our dance. We went inside, gave them our over priced tickets and already I felt a knot in my stomach at the sight of the gleaming dresses and sharp suits everyone was in. I blended into the crowd with a simple black dress, so there wasnt much to worry about beside sitting at a table with no friends as my best friend and her boyfriend left to eat dinner. 

I sat there on my phone, pissed I even came in the first place. Was this really worth it even? It wasn’t like I was about to meet the love of my life and dance the night away here. I sighed, mentally curling into a ball as I texted my parents to pick me up in an hour to make at least the rest of the night bearable by going home and watching maybe some TV. 

As my fingers rapidly tapped over my phone on the corner of my eye I thought I saw the foot of a girl in heels next to me, start melting. Her foot looked like it was caving in from the center and melting like cheese would inside of a microwave. 

I blink, and it is gone. 

Usually if I see something weird, I’m the type to ignore it honestly. So I look away and shrug, thinking my mind must be filled with so much anxiety I’m just seeing things. A dumb excuse but it worked for the time being.

I danced a few times to old tacky songs, the electric slide, Cupid shuffle, things like that. As we all were harmoniously dancing and shifting to the right and left. I saw something again.

People looked to be melting, as someone would shuffled next to another. Suddenly their arms would just liquify it seems and mush together with another person. 

Though no one else seemed to notice this. 

Everyone just kept dancing. While one, or I guess two people formed into one. Then another, and another. 

Fuck it was getting so weird. 

I now was heading to look for my best friend who I had drifted from because I didn’t feel like talking for a bit and then I saw with a horrified face. 

Her smile wide along with her boyfriend as they stared off into space, moving their leg right and left. Their arms melting together and their legs right next to each other had become one. It looked like a Barbie doll who had gotten amputated and her legs cut in half then got glued back together. 

I tried calling out to her, waving and staring with a concerned look but she didn’t seem to notice. The people beside me bumped into me as I was to distracted and I turn to see more people have melted together. Now instead of arms and legs, people were melting all the way to each other. 

Someone would be missing a shoulder and it would be a head instead. All still comically dancing to the fucking Cupid shuffle. 

I back away, gazing at the sight before me as it was like a bunch of army men marching or I guess, dancing together. And then slowly more people became closer, and closer until they had become one. Getting glimpses in the dark their faces contorted in such strange ways. 

Where the was lips, there would be two or three pairs each different colors, heights, shapes. Different eyes poking out from the side or mashed together and two irises shown. 

It’s like when your playing a video game and go through a character, that’s what it looked like. And then it started to get worse, and worse. Everyone seemed to be morphing together. The group of people got smaller, and smaller and all I could do was watch. The entrance blocked by an amalgamation of teachers I think. There was no way out of this place as the students began to become one. Everyone’s eyeballs becoming to mashed to fit in one spot and began going to the side, fingers were jutting from people’s wrists and lower arms. Lips were moving down to people’s jaws as there was still, wide smiles. 

Still throughout this, none were looking at me. I was wondering how I haven’t succumbed to this flesh monster, why I hadn’t been melted into hundreads like the other students of my high school. 

I didn’t understand, but I was too frozen in fear to try and come up with any explanation plausible enough for this. 
That was when they all seemed to be connected. It was like one entity now that was to big, to numerous to be human with facial features slapped in each spot of its goopy, blotched flesh of unmatched skin tones. It looked leathery yet sweaty at the same time. 

I try calling out to it, as stupid as it sounds.

“What are you?” I yelled as my voice strained with fear. 

A about twenty eyeballs turn to look at me. A symphony of male and female voices speaking in low moans. Their mouths still contorted in that wide grin while their mouths speaker of pain and the flesh pile was still twisting and moving at the same time. It looked like it was coming towards me. I don’t know what to do, it’s too big and is blocking the exit. I’m hiding under a table typing this. 

What will happen when I look at it?
Would it make me join its mass of people? Would the hundreds of mouths eat me? 
Would it talk?

I’m to scared to try and find out
