Being a custodian at a hospital was something I never aspired to do. I actually wanted to be a nurse, but life had other plans. Long story short, I never finished college. Now I mop the floor on the night shift as I watch others living out my dreams. It's not all bad though, I like being here. The sights. The sounds. I find myself daydreaming, picturing myself in those scrubs, starting IVs, hell, even changing bedpans. I've always felt that I was meant to be here, even if I was just the lowly housekeeper. But that dream was very rudely uprooted a few days ago. Now I hate this place.

The hospital is pretty quiet at night. Well, at least compared to the normal hustle and bustle of the dayshift. You could say that this place runs on a skeleton crew of sorts, only essential personnel are roaming the halls. 'Essential', the word makes me laugh. I don't have any delusions about my role in this place. I know my job is important but I have no doubt that I would be replaced in a heartbeat if it came down to it. It doesn't take a genius to take out the trash, but it's my job and I do it diligently. Everything on my to-do list gets checked off with as much precision as a surgeon's hand. When I leave, the toilets' white porcelain glistens under the bright fluorescent light. Every trash can is empty and ready for the next day's fill. The halls smell of fresh lemon-scented cleaning solution. It is my calling card and I make sure people notice. This diligence has earned me the recognition of the nurses, who always praise me for my hard work. It feels good to be recognized, and to show my gratitude I make sure I recognize them as well. 

I know every single person who works in the hospital by name, it's the least I can do for the people who work their asses off day and night to keep our patients alive. I greet everyone with a smile and ask them about their shift, their families, and their problems. This goes for the new hires as well. I greet them warmly, welcome them to the crew, and politely introduce myself. This was the story when I ran into a new face I'd never seen here before. 

I was cleaning the women's locker room when I heard the sound of a locker door slamming against metal. It was strange to have someone in there with me. The reason I cleaned the locker room at this time of night is because it's between shift changes. Being the nosey person that I am, I swept the floors in the direction of the sound. When I reached the line of lockers where the noise came from I tried acting surprised when I saw a woman putting on her scrub top. Her back was toward me and I don't think she heard me sneak up behind her when I casually gave her my 'Oh, Hi.' greeting. Her back tensed and I saw this eerie wave wash down her spine. I apologized for scaring her and expected whoever this was to turn and laugh about the near heart attack I'd just given them, but the woman remained still, for the most part. I looked down at her hands and her fingers were sporadically and independently crawling, it was as if she was quietly clawing at the air. I recognized this as a sign of anger and it occurred to me that I may have startled her into rage, some people don't take kindly to jumpscares. 

I apologized again telling her that I didn't expect to find someone else in here with me. Her fingers stopped scratching and her shoulders relaxed. Her head swiveled and I caught a glimpse of her side profile, I didn't recognize the face. She looked young maybe around mid-twenties. Despite her youth, there were a few wrinkles between her brows. She was angry, this primal blood thirst swimming in her eye. Slightly taken aback by her rage and somewhat embarrassed by my action I took a step back. The woman faces forward before turning around and pointing her clogs at me. To my relief, she was smiling, though my suspicions were correct, this was a face I didn't know. I blinked the surprise away and extended a hand. 

"Oh, hello are you new here?" I said awaiting her cordial shake. But instead of reaching for my hand, she studied it for a second, quizzically twisting her head, before timidly grasping my palm. Her fingers sequentially met the back of my hand and she squeezed just a bit too hard. 

"New?" She mulled the word over like a bitter morsel. When she swallowed it, she bared her teeth in what looked like a smile but was more comparable to an animalistic display. A warning. 'Tread lightly', the smile signaled. I tried pulling my hand away but she didn't let me. 

"New? Newish. I used to work here. A long time ago." 

She immediatly let go of my hand and the impression left behind on my skin began refilling with a red tinge. I was uncomfortable with the woman's conflicting emotions and politely but waryly eyed her from a safe distance. Thinking of what to say to break the tension I blurted out a random question, a repeated question. 

"You used to work here?" The question came with a giggly undertone, I laugh when I'm nervous. The woman retracted her teeth but still had her lips curled. 

"Once upon a time." Her response also came with a giggle, only hers was a teasing mimic of my own. Though her laugh lingered long after what is considered appropriate. It started as a hiccupping chuckle and slowly built up to a crazed cackle but as quickly as it started her laugh stopped. Our eyes locked in this unspoken joust. There was something uncanny about her stare. Her eyelids peeled back, irises floating precariously on their white backdrop. The muscles in her face started going slack and I backed away. 

"Well, it was nice meeting you." 

She never responded, or rather I didn't wait for a response. I lost her behind the wall of lockers but her emotionless laugh regained its full voice and followed me out. When the locker room door slammed shut I heard her voice slowly muting away before... nothing. There was an inexplicable feeling of dread that filled my heart. I looked down at my hands to find them trembling. 

'Why am I shaking?' I really didn't know. I guess it was the fact that I had this premonition of impending doom. Like something bad was going to happen. As if the woman's stare had marked me somehow. As if she was still watching me. 

I caught a glimpse of someone down the hall. At an intersection stood a nurse. The same nurse. She was watching me, scowling. My heart fluttered in fear. Without warning the nurse disappeared down the intersecting corridor and I was alone. Eerily, alone. 

It was sometime before I saw that nurse again, weeks in fact. I was so weirded out by the situation that I even asked around about her. As I made my way through the hospital's wings I would casually ask the people working in those departments about the new hire. Most of them would say that there was nobody new working in that department, not on the night shift anyway. They would ask for a name but since I didn't know it I was at a loss. Occasionally, the staff told me about a new nurse matching the description I'd given them, but when I snooped around to catch a glimpse, the nurses were never the one I was looking for... or trying to avoid. I really don't know which. I'd just about given up and assumed that the woman was working the day shift. 

'Good riddance.'

But one day as I was cleaning the halls of the pediatric ICU, out of the corner of my eye, I saw someone standing at the glass that looked into the nursery. She was sobbing. Her breaths came in arbitrary spurts that fought back a mountain of emotion. I tried giving her space, avoiding my eyes, and letting her cry in peace. But there was a strange familiarity in her voice. It suddenly clicked. The woman's sobs had the same tone as the nurse I'd seen in the locker room, and sure enough, when I lifted my eyes there she was, wiping away the tears that streamed from her cheeks. I froze in place, and as I did the woman's fingers grazed along the window. In the absence of my mop's slosh, the woman twisted her gaze toward me, her neck following closely behind. 

She was different. Not saying that this wasn't the nurse I'd seen in the locker room, but she'd somehow gotten older, more sickly. The right side of her face had lost its firm structure and now drooped down as if she'd suffered a stroke at some point between the last time I saw her and now. One of her arms had almost shriveled up and clung precariously to her chest, it looked grotesquely underdeveloped. When our eyes met, we stared at each other for a second before her lips parted to let out the pain inside her throat. She was missing teeth, and the ones she did have were rotten, black, and yellow. The reek of decay drifted out of her mouth and filled the air with the pungent odor of death. I covered my nose and fought back a gag. 

The woman lifted her good hand and pointed to the nursery. Her attention returned to the incubators inside. I hesitated to let my eyes drift away, but when I heard a baby start crying, my curiosity got the better of me. I took a few steps forward and peered into the nursery. It was empty, mostly. One lone baby lay inside one of the incubators, tubes sprouting from its face, needles feeding its little legs, and its chest rising and falling with shallow breaths. A little boy by the looks of it, the blue beenie on its head giving it away. It was one of the tiniest babies I'd ever seen. Its little lungs, however, roared with the might of a healthy baby boy. I looked back to the woman at my side, but when I didn't find anyone there I jumped. I scanned the hall, hoping to see her walking off down some corridor, but all trace of her was gone. That is until someone hobbled into the nursery. 

Her right leg trailed behind her as if it weighed twice as much as it should. She grunted with each stride and thrust her bad shoulder forward in an attempt to gain some momentum. I watched from the other side of the glass as she looked down at the baby's box. Her eyes ominously twisted to me and I got a good look at the fluid streaming down her cheeks. It was a thick viscous black that slooshed down like mud on a rainy sidewalk. When her murky eyes returned to the baby, she lifted her good hand and opened the incubator lid. Taking a finger she caressed the side of the baby's tiny head. I trembled nervously knowing something horrible was about to happen. Sure enough, the woman ripped the mask off of the baby's face. It's little head thumping the bedding at its back. The little boy howled and I covered my gaping mouth. The woman on the other side of the glass ripped the needles feeding the boy's legs, a stream of red blanketing the inside of the incubator. As the baby was lifted out of the box, its extremities fluttered in uncontrolled fits. I screamed. 

"Stop it, leave him be!" 

My voice went unregistered and the woman cradled the baby in her bad arm and hobbled away making her way to the nursery entrance. In full fight mode, I ran to meet her but when I rounded the corner the room was empty. The baby's screams echoed from the end of the hall and I sprinted out of the nursery praying that I was too late. I caught a glimpse of the woman's bum leg as it vanished into an adjoining hallway. 

"No God, please. Bring it back, for the love of God!" 

When I got to the hall I saw the nurse on the far end of the corridor. I ran at her but the ground under my feet seemed to be working against me, as if it was shifting back and the hall growing longer. The woman veered left, right, and left through the maze that is the hospital. I was always on her heels, though no matter how hard I tried I couldn't catch up. The woman finally pushed her way through some double doors and I watched as she held the baby with its leg, like a fish freshly pulled from the water, it hovered over a trash can. I gave one last desperate plea. 

"NO!" 

Her fingers released their hold. The baby was in free fall and the double doors clincked shut. 

I crashed through the doors and found myself in the ER waiting room. Every head swiveled to me, but I didn't pay them any mind. I sprinted to the trash can hoping to hear anything, the tiniest of whimpers would've given me hope, but the trash was quiet. Only the crunch of discarded plastic wrappers from the vending machine crackled out of the metal tin as I rummaged through. The ER receptionist walked up behind me and asked if I was okay. I snapped at her furiously. 

"No, the baby. where is the fucking baby?" She looked at me confused. 

"What baby?" she asked stupidly.

I didn't have time for her bullshit so I kept pulling trash from the tin. Trash decorated the ground around me, but still no baby. A crowd of hospital staff and patients were starting to gather. I heard someone ask another to call security in a hushed voice. But I still frantically searched the trash can. I heard the authoritative steps of security guards' shoes on the linoleum. Even worse I felt the life at the bottom of this bin slowly slipping away. 

Finally, at the bottom of the can, I saw a towel soaked in fresh blood. Without hesitation, I cradled it with both hands. I carefully laid it on the ground and unwrapped its contents. It was as if all the air was sucked out of the room in a millisecond. Sprawled out on the ground, was a tiny premature baby boy. Its face was a light shade of blue, its tiny body limp. 

"No, no, no." 

I took two fingers and pushed them into its tiny chest. What felt like an eternity was mere seconds, but the baby's limbs roared to life. The baby was snatched up by the ER staff and rushed into the back. The code blue alarms blaring throughout the hospital. I trembled uncontrollably as I tried following the baby to the back, but the staff stopped me. 

I sat in the ER waiting room for hours. So long in fact that the sun was starting to shine through the ER's sliding glass door. The whole time I stared blankly at the wall. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get the baby's screams out of my head. A hand touched me on the shoulder and I was thrust back into reality. I looked up to find the hospital president asking me to follow him. 

He led me to the security room, monitors glowing along one of the walls. A burly security guard was sitting on a swivel chair overlooking the images on each screen. Without addressing me, the hospital president simply patted the guard's back and said,

"Show her." 

The guard pulled up a video feed of the ER waiting room and zoomed in on the sliding glass door. I was confused and looked at the hospital president. He didn't say anything and gestured to the screen, instructing me to watch closely. Suddenly on the monitor appeared a young girl, she must've been in her teens. She walked nervously through the ER entrance, glancing around, cowering away. She was cradling something in her arms, I recognized the fabric instantly. The girl on the screen took a seat on the chair nearest to the exit. She looked to be crying. We watched her periodically look down at the bundle in her arms, lovingly but timidly letting the tears fall on the baby. She looked around one more time and when she was sure all eyes were off of her she walked over to the trash can. She stood there for a few seconds, fighting her inner demons, but they ended up winning. With extreme amounts of gentility, she placed the baby in the trash. Wiping away tears she slipped out of the ER unnoticed. The timestamp in the corner of the video ticked by. One minute turned into two, two into three. Suddenly a crazed lunatic smashed through the two metal doors along one side of the ER waiting room. She ran directly to the trash can and started decorating the floor with trash. An employee walked up behind her and asked what was wrong. My static voice came through the speakers. 

"No, the baby. where is the fucking baby?" 

Not soon after a bundle was pulled from the trash. We watched as I unwrapped it and pushed life back into the child. When they pulled the baby from my arms they stopped the video. 

The security guard swiveled in his chair and leaned back in anticipation of the president's question. We both turned to the president who measured his words, a hint of pride and admiration in his eyes. 

"How did you know?" 

Both pairs of eyes looked at me and eagerly awaited a response. The memories of the homunculus baby-snatching monster flashed through my eyes. Visions of her malicious intent were clear. 

I looked back at the two and simply shrugged my shoulders.

"I don't know. I just knew." 

The two looked at each other as if they'd just witnessed a miracle. They crossed their arms and studied me from afar. 

"Well, I want you to know that you're a hero." The president said. 

"And your co-workers want to let you know as well." 

He opened the door and a wave of clapping filled the long hall. On each side of the corridor stood nurses, doctors, receptionists, and everyone who had heard the news. I was shocked to be greeted by such a spectacle. I tried cowering back into the room but the president urged me forward. With no other choice, I timidly walked through the two lines of people. Itching my arm, hiding away from an honor I was sure I didn't deserve. The clapping was frenzied but one lone pair of hands smashed together louder than any other. At the end of the hall stood a familiar twisted face. Her good hand thwarting against her shriveled palm. Her eyes peeled back and her rotting grin. I looked around to see if anyone else was seeing what I was but no one paid her any mind, it was only me who could see her. I returned my eyes to the monster who gave me patronizing praise. I was transfixed by her ugly scowl and sickly body, it was as if the sight of her nasty body was becking me to keep my eyes on her, like an impending trainwreck. I had tunnel vision. For a second, it was only me and her standing in that hall. Watching eachother, sizing the other one up. 

There was a sticky squelch on the underside of my shoe. I looked down to see what I'd just stepped on. It was a piece of flesh, a tendril glob of meat that looked freshly ripped from the bone. The foul smell of old ground beef drifted into my nose, iron-rich and metallic. The smell was so strong that I tasted it in my mouth. 

'Clap, clap, clap.' 

I looked around the floor and found splotches of blood scattered across the tile. The blood seemed to be streaming from the walls, but as my eye followed the fluid up, I saw a pair of lifeless feet. 

'Clap, clap, clap.' 

My eyes floated up, passed the knees, and pelvis, and stopped on the person's abdomen. Interails spilled out of the stomach lining, and the corporal stench of a fresh kill filled the hall. The gore belonged to a doctor. I scanned the long hall and my mouth filled with bile as I noticed the carnage. Everyone who'd come to show their appreciation was dead, mangled, torn to pieces. 

'Clap, clap, clap.' 

I returned my eyes to the twisted creature at the end of the hall. It started laughing, crazed and maniacal. Her laugh made my skin crawl. She didn't say anything but she didn't have to. I understood.  

'You saved the baby. Now, how are you going to save them.' 

She smacked her palms one last time before dragging her bum leg down the intersecting hallway. A chill washed across my body and reality roared back into my eyes. 

'Clap, clap, clap.'

How do I save them?
