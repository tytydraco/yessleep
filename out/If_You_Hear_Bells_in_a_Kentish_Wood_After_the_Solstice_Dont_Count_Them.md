I grew up in Medway, in one of those villages that still pretends it isn’t part of anywhere important.

You know the kind. A Norman church with a leaning tower, a pub named after an animal that doesn’t live here anymore, and a strip of ancient woodland everyone insists is “just trees” despite being older than the road, the houses, and probably the idea of Christmas itself.

There’s a footpath that cuts through the wood. Public right of way. Shows up on Ordnance Survey maps in that confident pink line that suggests nothing has ever gone wrong there.

People use it all year.

Except between the solstice and New Year.

No signs say this. No council notice. You just learn. Like you learn not to whistle in certain fields or take hawthorn indoors.

In school they told us it was because the path floods.

It doesn’t.

On Christmas Eve this year, I took the path anyway.

My mum was in Medway Maritime. Buses were off. Taxis wouldn’t come down the lanes because of ice. My phone was on 8 percent, and the long way round would have taken an hour.

I told myself I was being stupid. I’m in my thirties. I don’t believe in bells in the woods.

The path swallowed me almost immediately.

Kent woodland in winter feels close. Chalk underfoot, roots slick with frost, hornbeam and oak knitting together overhead. Holly flared dark and glossy in the half-light. Everything felt old. Older than the villages. Older than the church.

That’s when I saw the lanterns.

Not electric. Not solar. Real flame lanterns, hanging from hawthorn branches every few metres, as if someone had carefully laid out a procession route.

They hadn’t been there earlier. I would have noticed.

Then the bell rang.

Once.

Deep. Muffled. Like it had soil in it.

The woods went still in that horrible, attentive way animals do when something enters their space.

I stopped walking.

The bell rang again.

Two notes. Slightly out of time.

And suddenly I remembered something my nan used to say when the days started drawing in.

“Never count bells after the turn,” she’d mutter. “They’re not meant for us.”

I checked my phone.

4:23 pm. No signal.

The light between the trees thinned, as if dusk had sped up just for me. The lanterns ahead burned brighter. Behind me, the path stretched longer than it should have, dark and unfamiliar.

Then came the third bell.

Close enough that I felt it in my teeth.

Footsteps followed. Slow. Bare. Careful on frozen chalk.

Someone was humming.

Not a carol. Something older. A working tune.

I stepped off the path and crouched behind a fallen beech, heart hammering so hard I thought it would give me away.

The figure walked into view.

It was man-shaped, wrapped in layered skins and old coats stitched beyond recognition. Ivy, holly and mistletoe hung from it, tied with twine. Antlers were wired to its head, crooked, ribboned with dark red cloth.

The mask was wood.

Carved.

A smile too wide. Teeth marked as if someone had counted them.

In its hand was a bell that looked dug up rather than made.

It stopped exactly where I’d been standing.

“Late,” it said, pleasantly.

Its voice was wrong in the worst way. Local. Familiar. Like someone I’d spoken to a hundred times.

“We keep the old calendar here,” it said. “Someone must walk the path. Someone must be seen.”

I pressed my face into my sleeve to stop myself breathing.

“No matter,” it continued. “There’s always one who forgets.”

It rang the bell once more.

The lanterns dimmed.

Then it stepped off the path and disappeared between the trees, humming as it went.

Eventually the woods returned to normal. Wind. A fox barking far away.

I ran.

On Christmas morning, the church bells rang late.

Just once.

They said it was a mechanical fault.

They said old Graham Ellis hadn’t come home from his walk.

They said the woodland path hadn’t been used.

But that night, I heard humming outside my house.

Slow. Patient.

And somewhere nearby, a bell rang, not to mark the hour, but to make sure the year kept moving.
