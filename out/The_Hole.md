Major discoveries are driven by curiosity, and kids excel at this. They do not understand the world; they feel it. If a meal has steam coming out of it they bite it and feel the heat, it burns them but they discover that next time they should wait. Kids that are exceptionally good at this grow up with a sense of wonder that pushes them to explore the world and its secrets. I am one of those kids—or so I thought

My house has been sinking for the last few months. More specifically, my kitchen. One morning, a 30-centimeter hole appeared, swallowing 4 tiles that stood in the middle. They didn’t break; they vanished into the dirt. The kitchen floor has a flower pattern that repeats on each tile. The tiles were absorbed by the dirt, but the flower pattern remained, imprinted on the ground. There was no clay, asphalt or cement—just black mud.. That fascinated me, I should have reported it right away, but my curiosity got the best of me. How could that be? What type of natural event can do this? The next day the hole was 10 centimeters deeper.  
  
I work in finance but I’ve always loved science. Sadly, my parents didn’t. The hole was a sign for me, I was meant to find it. I started documenting the kitchen, taking photos of the hole, measuring the area, and collecting samples from the dirt. In a span of a few days, the hole had grown to cover the area where the kitchen table stood and was 2 meters deep. The flower pattern always reappeared on the dirt, even If I moved it around during the day or dropped water on it.I couldn’t explain how that happened.

My mom came over for dinner two weeks after the hole appeared. We had a big fight. She doesn’t understand, she never has. All my life I’ve done what she wanted: I studied what she thought was the safest option, I bought the house she said would suit me best, hell I even dress with the clothes she approves of. Most of my decisions need her approval, but not this one!.  She wanted to call a contractor to come and fix the hole, as if there was something to fix.

“SHE IS SO STUPID! A natural anomaly like this one must be studied; If I am able to document and understand what is happening I could become someone” I thought to myself.

She left my house, we stopped talking since. She seemed genuinely concerned, but I knew it’s only because she didn't understand. The day after the fight was the first time I couldn’t  see the bottom of the hole. I couldn’t tell how deep it was. I threw a 30 meter rope but didn’t reach the bottom. I stopped leaving the house unless it was for groceries. I  spent all my time researching, convinced I was close to discovering something important: a reason.

Last night, something changed. I woke up to a disturbing noise—like the rhythmic stomping of a herd of animals. My head throbbed, as if not just my ears but my whole body could hear the sounds. Instinctively I went to check the hole. The kitchen floor was completely gone; the hole had devoured every square inch.. The sound was coming from within it. The darkness in the hole contracted and expanded in sync with the noise. This transcended physics—the dark circle breathed to the rhythm of the sound it produced. As the noise grew louder and louder, I stood there, mesmerized by the beauty of what was happening. The “stampede”  closed in on me, suddenly, primal fear took over.  I closed my eyes, terrified.

 As soon as I did, the sound stopped.

When I opened my eyes again, the hole was staring back at me, it took me two full breaths to understand what was going on. My body was paralyzed; I couldn’t process what was happening, I was afraid but I also felt at peace. The darkness was gone, replaced by the universe. I saw stars, planets, and nebulas swirling around inside the hole, all moving in a flower pattern.

I understood my purpose, why I was there—everything  I had done had led to that moment. It was beautiful, I cried through the night, and eventually passed out. When I woke up,I was lying naked in the middle of the kitchen. The hole was gone, and the tiles were back in place, as if nothing had ever happened. I understand now:

“We seek no reason for our presence; it is in our being here that we find our purpose.”

Mom died yesterday. I wish I had talked to her one last time, but I’m sure I will see her again when we’re both part of the hole.

I love you, Mom. I understand now.
