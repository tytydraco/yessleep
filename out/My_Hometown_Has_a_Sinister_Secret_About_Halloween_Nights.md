Hi, I'm not gonna reveal my name as I don't want people to trace to this damn town again so I'm just gonna come up with fake names for all individuals involved. Either way, I'm now sure that this has happened to plenty of kids before and since then anyways, if I don't reveal a name, I'm sure as hell they can't track me… I hope.

For now, I will call myself Em, and my friend in the story Jay.

Jay was one of my best friends growing up. We would do everything together. He and I grew up on the same street, went to the same school, and tried to do as much together as possible. He was one of the sweetest people I’ve ever known. The events of that night still fill me with so much rage… and sadness.

It was Halloween night, and I remember the whole day like it was yesterday, although I wish I didn't. I was 12 and Jay was 13 at the time, both of our birthdays were in October so we’d always be excited about going up in number and feeling more mature and on our own on Halloween nights. This was finally the first night that both of our parents let us go trick-or-treating on our own. I know why now, but to us then it was a new sense of freedom that I felt, a freedom I wouldn't feel again for many years.

“We finally are on our own now aren't we Em?” Jay said in a leadership tone. 

“I suppose so,” I responded quietly. I had always been sorta scared of being on my own, but like I said before the sense of freedom did feel good, so I wasn't gonna complain.

We went around the decorated streets with the lit-up orange and yellow hues blinding us with spooky wonder, These streets were decorated like hell most years, it is the most festive town for Halloween I know of, and honestly, it was confusing to me as a child when Christmas time would come around and not nearly as many places were decorated for that holiday spirit. It was almost as if Halloween was some kinda sacred holiday in this town.

As Jay and I walked down the streets, I started noticing things not feeling exactly right. Any adults who were outside seemed to be staring directly at us, but they would always quickly look down at their feet as soon as our gazes would meet. Some of them had the most uncanny of looks on their faces, like something was severely wrong, and it was.

I noticed lights start to go out as soon as we approached to knock on the doors for candy. Even then I thought to myself what kinda assholes would see kids approaching and turning their lights off on Halloween night?

I adjusted my glasses to my face and looked down the street tho and did see one house all the way at the end of it. It seemed to be the most decorated house on the entire block, and the brightest, surely they wouldn't ignore and deny us candy like these other houses had begun doing. 

I looked at the watch and noticed it was 11:30, This would have to be our last stop for the night before headed back home, we had gotten a pretty good haul of sweets so I wasn't upset, but this house called to us, with how festive it was for the season, they might have even been selling full chocolate bars or something.

As we approached the house though I started hearing strange sounds. Sobbing? From inside some houses, not every house, but lots of them, the air felt still and tingles went down my spine. 

I turned to Jay “Jay? I’m actually not so sure about this house t-t-this street is starting to freak me out a little,” my young childhood stutter would always come back with a vengeance whenever I got scared. “I-I-I am n-not so sure about -it,” I repeated. Tears started to form in my eyes a little, I was nothing but a kid so hearing others crying and feeling out in the open and vulnerable like this made me tear up. 

Jay laid his hand on my shoulder, “It’s okay Em,” he reassured me. “It's one more house where we're gonna get our candy and get home.” 

Jay’s reassurance always worked on me, he was a persistent one but he’d always know what to say to me to make me ‘woman up’ as he would say. Although looking back on it, I almost feel angry at him, angry that he led us into the situation that we were about to enter, 

but… I can't be, I wasn't even the one who was most hurt.

We finally arrived up the long centered sidewalks that lead to the vertical home and knocked on the door. The back wood door started to slowly open.

“Trick or treat!”

“Trick or tr-”

We tried to speak in unison but my speech was stopped. Looking at this man who answered, he didn't look right, and not in a Halloween costume kinda way. His skin was pale and his black tuxedo didn't help contrast the skin even more. He seemed to be sweating bullets. He stared blankly at us through his emerald green eyes, those damn eyes. I still remember exactly how they looked to this day, the pupil incredibly dilated, and his eyes bloodshot. 

I pulled back my candy bag in slight apprehension and tears started to well up in my eyes again. The man notices my scared state and finally speaks in a jittery rhythm, “Ss-so kids… how was your H-H-Halloweennn?” 

“Um… sir, can you please just give us our candy?” Jay responded, noticing my fear and trying to get us out of the situation.

The man seemed to be growing impatient, tapping his feet on the ground, and saying with gritted teeth, “Just trying to make some small talk with you kids,” He pulled on his tux collar, sweating profusely. Then, I noticed around his collarbone area a patch of dried? Rotten? Frayed flesh. Whatever was wrong with it, it was sure wrong with it.

At that thought though, I felt a sting on the back of my neck, at first I slapped the back of my neck, thinking it to be some sort of insect, but I also heard a slap from Jay. Had we both gotten bit? That's when I looked behind me and saw two men towering over us. 

A tear was already down my face and I slowly started to lose all power in my muscles and fell to the ground slowly, fully knocked out.

When I awoke my glasses were off my face, everything was blurred, and I couldn't move, couldn't tell if it was some sort of drugging or pure fear. In front of me was another body on the floor, it was my friend, Jay, I could recognize his dark hair and dark skin, but other than that things were blurred beyond my comprehension. 

As I started to awake slightly more, I heard yelling coming from around me. 

“We told you to only grab one you damn idiot!” A man yelled.

“They both came to my door, what was I supposed to do k-k-k-kick one away!?” The voice was recognizable, it was the man we had just met in the doorway.

“You're about to die anyways, why don't we just put you in the sacrifice with them?” The man threatened. 

Sacrifice? What's happening? I wanted to cry, I wanted to speak, but I could barely move a millimeter. I was stuck on the ground seeing the burred silhouettes of the two men standing slightly behind my friend. 

“Just get the job done you damn idiot,” The man said.

At that moment the man seemed to put something in his hand up to my friend's face. My friend awoke in a loud gasp. I had only noticed now that Jay was shackled by chains as the man from the door picked them off the ground, his tall lengthy figure barely holding them up.

“Wh-Wha-” Jay questioned, “What happened!?” Jay yelled with desperation in his voice. The man stayed silent, completely unphased and ignoring his question.

“Sir please!” Jay pleaded, “I'm sorry! Did we do something? We're very very sorry!” 

The desperation in Jay’s voice, every word he was yelling rings back in my head every damn day. I couldn't see well enough to see if he was crying, but just from his voice, I could tell he was.

I tried my best to speak, but all I could muster up were mutters too quiet to hear Jay’s yelling. My friend was being pulled away from me, I couldn't tell exactly where we were. Some kinda forest from what I could hear and tell. 

Jay’s screams became louder, but further away, and I could see the man dragging him by the chains he had him tied to into the darkness ahead of me. 

“Sir! PLEASE! I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY! IM SORR-” The screams stopped, did something happen? I heard the rustling of chains in the distance, it was so quiet, and all I could hear was the sight of wildlife around me.

Then, I heard footsteps fastly approaching, closer and closer, the dirt was being trampled. I saw dirt start to kick up near me when I saw the man from the door run right past me without my friend and heard a scream that still haunts me every day.

“AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!” It was Jay, I couldn't see him but I could hear him, his voice trembling and breaking as his scream grew louder, but it wasn't the only sound I heard. 

A guttural roar was let out, whatever had just made that noise was surely no human.  The roar grew in power before I heard a large crunch, and a scream, whipping in the air, more screaming. I couldn't see a thing but I could hear the horror beyond the darkness. That was until…

SLAM

A couple of meters ahead of me I could see a blurry red pile of mush in front of me, followed by something, slowly walking up into the moonlight. To this day I can't describe it, not only could I not see it clearly in the first place, but even then, it seemed… indescribable. 

It was something furry and had almost the physique and look of a wolf it seemed, but much larger. Its eyes were glowing red, and its teeth were also red, probably not naturally looking back on it. It seemed to have patches of fur that weren't all there showing what seemed like thin veiny skin on the inside. 

It then picked up the red mushy pile and started swinging it around in its mouth like a dog playing with a toy, blood splattering everywhere. I felt the liquid splash onto my face and it dripped down onto my eye, causing half my vision to be colored red. It stung like hell but at that moment I couldn't care less, my adrenaline was already running so high I could barely feel it.

It was then that the monster dropped the mush, and started walking slowly towards me. 

This is it for sure, I’m done for, I barely even lived, I'm just a kid, it's not supposed to happen like this. It sniffed and sniffed as it got closer, coming slightly more into my blurred view. It kneeled and growled viciously, only inches away from my face. At that point, I could see its mouth pretty clearly. Blood was dripping from its teeth and its entire mouth smelt of death. A death I was sure I was about to face.

WHISTLE

The creature backed away. 

“You’ve had your fixin’ now, get back! Get back!” a man yelled. It was the man from earlier who shouted at the man from the door.

A familiar voice then started shouting! “What the hell is wrong with you? Putting her in all this!” Mom? 

I finally made an audible noise, still stuck on the ground unmoving, but groaning as much as I could.

“Oh my god,” my mom said, “she’s awake?” 

“Shit!” I heard steps towards me from behind and felt a sting once again on my neck. 

As I was slipping back into unconsciousness I heard more yelling and screaming, “Do you realize what you've just done!?” my mom yelled.

“Relax, relax. I’ll tell you what you need to do okay, just te.. Dr… a..”

I couldn't hear anymore and my body was once again giving up. I was drifting further and further. 

“Honey?” my mom was once again speaking, but as I woke up I noticed I was no longer in those woods. I was in my room. “All the spookiness yesterday must’ve given you nightmares huh?”

“Mommy!” I pushed myself into her arms and held in for a close hug. 

“Awe sweetie, “ she reassured, “It was all just a dream okay?” 

But… no. I backed off my mom a bit. My eye was still stinging, and later that day I was told my friend Jay had ‘gone missing’ on his way home last night.

Bullshit.

I know what I saw that day was real and none of the people in that godforsaken town can tell me otherwise. I tried to convince everyone, tried to convince my mom, hoping to whatever god there is out there that she wasn't in on this. But even she started calling me crazy.

Around the time I turned 18 the scars from this incident never healed. The attitude of everyone around me shifted, and only a month into my adulthood, my own mother forced me into a mental hospital for a whole year. I saw things there, things I can't unsee. But, I’ve gone on too long. If anyone is interested in that time in my life I might make an update to this post, but ever since I got out of there 3 years ago, I left that town and never turned back. 

I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore. But I might as well try telling some internet strangers the real truth right? I still don't know exactly what is going on in that town, but I know it's something sinister, I wonder if I should go back or not, or if I did, whether or not they would even accept me back. 

Thank you for listening…
