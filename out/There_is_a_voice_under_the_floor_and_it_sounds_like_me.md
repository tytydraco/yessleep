I really don’t know what to make of it, or what really happened. I can't seem to figure it out. I am deeply disturbed and haven’t slept well for the past couple of days. If any of you have gone through the same or have any experience, please help me. Any help will do.

I heard scratching beneath the floorboards. Yeah normal I know but what’s truly been disturbing me is the voice I had heard, I heard my own voice! It was calling my dog's name from under the house, while I was standing in the hallway. Well, I might be getting ahead of myself, though. Let me start from the beginning.

Back in January, I moved into a small house on the edge of the San Juan National Forest after my divorce was finalized. I was looking for some peace and solitude, a place where I could rebuild my life away from the chaos of the city and forget the memories of my failed marriage. The house was old and charming, the thing i loved the most was that the windows caught the morning light just right. It was perfect for just me and Max, my German Shepherd who'd been my loyal companion through the darkest days of the separation.

From the beginning, I felt something was off. Max was behaving weird, he was usually curious and bold but now he wouldn't go near the crawl space entrance in the hallway. He'd avoid that section of the house entirely, and sometimes, when passing by, he'd stop and growl, hackles raised, eyes fixed on that small wooden door set into the wall.

"It's just mice," "Or the house settling." I told myself

At night, I began hearing soft scratching coming from under the floorboards. Then I heard a low voice that seemed oddly like my own, but it was distorted, sort of.

"Max... come here..." I heard it while I was going to bed.

When I looked into the hallway mirror, I saw Max standing frozen at the end of the corridor, staring at the crawl space entrance, a continuous growl rumbling from deep in his chest. The voice repeated again:

"Max... come here..."

That damned voice was just like mine but it was seemingly distorted and it sounded like hearing yourself on a recorder played at half-speed.

I couldn't sleep that night. The next morning, with daylight streaming through the windows, I worked up the courage to investigate. I pulled open the crawl space door and shined my flashlight inside. What I found made my blood run cold.

There were scratch marks on the wooden beams, deep gouges in the wood, too substantial to be from a raccoon or even a bobcat. When I investigated further, I found something, something arranged in perfect spirals on the dirt floor, it was dozens of animal bones and in the center, a tattered scrap of what looked like human clothing.

My hands were trembling, I got out and I immediately called the local animal control officer. James was a burly guy in his fifties who'd seen everything in his thirty years patrolling these mountains. Or so I thought. When he emerged from the crawl space, his face had gone pale beneath his beard.

"Whatever made those tracks..." "wasn't walking on four legs."

He advised me to stay somewhere else for a few nights while he set up cameras and traps. I told him I will be leaving the next day and he can get started with his investigation.

That night, Max vanished. He was there when I went to bed but I heard him barking around 2 AM. He was somewhere far, it felt like it was coming from the woods. I sprang out of my bed and checked all over the house for that black fur but I didn’t find him anywhere, having the worst thoughts in my mind I searched for a flashlight and ran off into the woods. Just as I entered the tree-line the barking just stopped like nothing. But in desperation, I still searched for hours, stumbling through the forest floor but Max was gone, I couldn’t find him anywhere. 

Exhausted and heartbroken, I returned to the house. The sun began crawling up. I figured I will call up for some help and search again later. As I was nearing my house I heard Max barking. I was feeling relieved and happy thinking he might have come back from the woods or he might have been in the house and I might have missed him somehow. I began jogging towards my small house but the moment I swung open the door and entered the house, I realized the barking was coming from under the floor. I couldn’t wrap my head around it, what was going on? Max was scared of the crawl space, how did he end up in there? Shaking the thoughts off my head I was about to pull on the crawl space door when the barking sounded different, it now sounded like a laugh.

The noise increased to a higher level, now it seemed deafeningly loud. My head was spinning, it sounded like the barks and laughing blended together creating a symphony from hell and just like that it stopped. All I heard was my deep ragged breathing.

I couldn’t spend another minute in the house and so I moved out that morning. Threw whatever I could into my truck and didn't look back. I never returned for the rest of my things. Never filed a police report about Max. Never told anyone what I'd heard.

I moved into another house far from that place, that hell. Three months later, I saw a news report. A young couple had bought the house. They'd gone missing within a week of moving in. Their families reported they'd stopped answering calls, and when police investigated, they found the house empty, nothing was stolen and there were no signs of struggle. One odd detail confused the detectives, something surreal, the floor was broken and ripped at some places in the house, the crawl space door was broken and missing. That reaffirms my decision was not wrong.

But I am really not sure, sometimes I wake up hearing that voice, my voice, calling in the darkness. Sometimes I wonder if I really escaped at all, or if something followed me out of that house, something that waits beneath whatever floor I walk on, learning my sounds, my patterns, my voice.

Because the last thing I heard as I drove away that morning was a whisper from the back seat of my truck,

"Won’t you take your dog with you?."
