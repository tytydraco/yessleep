I used to live in a small town up north -like, up north where it’s snowing for half the year. I was born there and stayed until I was thirteen. My dad was a fisherman who would go out to sea for weeks at a time, and my mom stayed home to take care of me. It wasn’t the best childhood, but I had parents who cared about me. 



The reason why we left when I was in seventh grade was when I was walking home from school one winter. When you live in the subarctic, the nights get longer. I stayed around school a little bit to check out the northern lights. I would always look at them by the window at school, so much that I would sometimes need to be told by my teacher to stay focused.



I looked at the lights in the sky at the beach by my school, but then I saw a pair of eyes closer to the sand. They were looking straight at me. My mom and my teacher, Mr Lacroix, would sometimes tell me that polar bears hung out that time of year, but I thought five minutes after school wouldn’t be so bad. 



I didn’t run. Not right away. I kept looking at those eyes, and backed away slowly. My heart was already pounding, my eyes were darting around for any escape. 



That was the thing in my town; people left the car doors unlocked in case anyone came across a bear. I saw a truck; a black pickup with big wheels, and when I got close enough, I finally booked it inside and slammed the door shut. I pulled up the locks on both sides as soon as I got inside, and the bear was ten feet away when I got inside; clawing at the door.



I started crying, curled up in the back of this truck with this polar bear lurking around outside. I just thought, “I wanna’ go home. I wanna’ go home. I don’t want to die. Why can’t this bear go away?”



The white bear was hungry, and when it wasn’t pawing at the door, it was staring at me through the window. Its eyes reflected off the northern lights to beam right back at me. My dad was out fishing and my mom was home and couldn’t get out there; the snow was thick and more was coming down on that night. 



I knew I wasn’t going to outrun the bear. I was only lucky to have found the truck and had the good sense to back up as to not trigger the bear to start charging towards me. I didn’t know whose truck it was, but I was glad it was there. It had to have been a teacher, whichever one it was. 



So I was stuck there, locked in a truck with a polar bear staring at me and waiting for me to come out. It was patient. And I knew I couldn’t wait as long as it could.



It felt like forever being in that truck for hours, just seeing the bear stare at me from outside the truck. It sat there, waiting. That was the thing I was most afraid about; it sat and waited, as if it had all the time in the world. 



It made a noise, it could have been a yawn or a growl, but I heard what came close to, 

“Come… out…”



I was so cold, so hungry, in that truck. I tried the keys, but the engine sputtered. The truck was frozen solid. I tried to keep myself warm in my layers of clothing, and kept looking through the window at the bear. 



One of the teachers, Mr Lacroix, came out from a nearby door of the school. But he was frozen by the sight of the bear. He ran back inside, but the bear charged after him, crashing through the door. 



I forced my legs through the knee-deep snow. Every step felt heavier than the last, but I couldn’t stop. I forced myself to run until I reached my house and got inside. My mom grabbed me and, of course, asked where I was. 



All I could say to her was, “Bear.”



The morning after, my mom didn’t let me go to school because of the snow and after hearing on the local radio that Mr Lacroix died from the bear attack. Part of me feels guilty for staying out, since he would have gotten to his truck safe and I would’ve been at home. 



Everyone had to wait until the police scared off the bears away from the school, and any that could be captured were put in a facility until they could be released. Even after the bears were cleared out, the road still had to be cleared. Everything took months to do, and it was until June that people were on the roads and streets again. I was relieved, but also scared because they could come back in the winter again.



I’m glad to be alive, and not many people would have made it in my place. When summer came, my parents and I decided to move. My dad became a warehouse worker in the big city, and my mom worked at the mall. Even though I missed my friends in elementary school, I made some new friends in high school and in college. 



I don’t think I could have stayed in that town with bears coming every winter. Whenever it snows, I’m always reminded of my old home. But some snowy nights, I think about the northern lights and the night I saw the bear staring at me. 



I don’t think the bear was evil. It was only doing what it needed to survive. That doesn’t mean I want to be anywhere near one again. There’s not much for me to say except something I heard about how to deal with bears:



If it’s black, fight back.



If it’s brown, lie down.



If it’s white, say goodnight.
