I kicked at a stone that caught the light well. I grunted, bent, picked it up, wiped some dirt away with my thumb. It was brown, with hints of red. Chert. I tossed it aside and pressed palms into the small of my back. Around me were wheat fields. Some hedges and ditches. Brambles. Nettles. A solitary oak tree. I ran a hand over my shaven head that came away damp. Is it true that you can sweat out alcohol from the night before? I might’ve searched for the answer on my phone, but I’d smashed the thing against a wall.

I walked further along the footpath, eyes down and scanning for anything shiny or with a ghost-like imprint that might betray a fossil. Something unique. I inspected some more chert and a curiously round chunk of granite, then decided I ought to widen the radius of my search to beneath the eaves of the wheat plants. Around the stems, the soil was less cracked and parched, and more loamy. As I went, the land’s natural camber and undulation put me in the way of a sudden breeze. The crops roiled and waved. It made me wonder if they were an effective windbreak, or whether the wind just scythed around them. Part of me wanted to lie down in the field to find out. I couldn’t see anyone around, so I urinated downwind, aiming for the dirt fissure of the pathway.

Maybe the best way to find a valuable item isn’t to judge it by face value. What about a more random sampling technique? I squatted and freed a dull, grey stone from the soil. There in my hand, I couldn’t see anything remotely interesting about it. What if it was a geode, though? I picked up a larger rock and bashed at it a couple of times to see if I could crack it open. An edge of the rock jabbed into my thumb as I bludgeoned the stone, and I cursed. I got to my feet and hurled them both deep into the wheat. A starling emerged and fluttered through the air towards the hedgerow ahead. I followed, sucking on my thumb and scowling. 

Here was the border between two fields. A brook flowed under an arch of bracken, blackthorn bushes and stunted trees, roughly north to south. I planted my boots on the wooden beams of a footbridge. Who had built this? How old was it? Victorian era, maybe? I spied a rusted plough that the hedge had claimed for itself, and walked over. I touched it. Once cherished, now abandoned. This was pre-Victorian, perhaps. I pictured a leathery-skinned man urging on a horse from atop the plough. For some reason, he wore a flatcap. He wanted to finish up and get back home. There was no electricity, and it was getting dark. People had other concerns back then. Everything was different. Time had eddied over these fields like an estuary over a sandbar, I knew. 

Beyond the plough was a gap where I assumed the stream could be accessed. I crouched and dipped through to investigate, heedless of the brambles tugging on my clothes. It was more spacious than I expected. I found myself in a small, sheltered hollow beside a pool. Roots twisted through the muddy banks and I saw stones embedded in there too. This was good. Who knew how long they had been in there being squeezed out laterally? They were surely much older than what I’d been finding on the dusty pathway between the wheat crops. The first thing I found was a bottlecap by my foot. Then I prized a few clods of earth out and sifted through them, finding nothing of note. I dropped close to the pool’s edge and washed my hands in it. As I did, my hand brushed something beneath the surface. Something noticeably cold. I pulled it out from the sludge. 

In my hand was a beautiful weapon. A dagger, dull gold in colour. Droplets of muddy water ran down my forearm to drip off my elbow as I stared at it, frozen. It was more than old- it was ancient. Roman? Celtic? I dipped it back into the water and carefully rubbed away the mud. A thumbnail-sized sapphire gleamed at the base of the pommel, flashing prisms of light all around. And I saw that glyphs had been wrought into the blade’s crossguard. Spiral shapes. Triangles. Hands. I tried the tip and found it sharp. I smiled, admiring the treasure that would surely unlock me a fortune. 

As I marvelled at the dagger, a chill crept up my spine. The air around me grew dense and gooseflesh erupted on my skin. Birds remained perched on branches, visible above and around me, but they’d stopped singing. The warm light of the hollow darkened slightly. 

“You found my dagger, then.”

I turned to see a shape, human-sized, blocking the entrance. My heart began to pound, my head throbbed, and I squeezed the dagger’s handle tight.

“Your dagger?”

“Aye, it’s about time I passed it on.”

The stranger stepped forward. He was a short man. His hair was long and grey, and his face was broad. Kind. Sympathetic. Knowing eyes beneath bushy brows. He wore green corduroy trousers and a faded shirt, open at the neck where white hairs sprouted through.

“Are you the farmer? Is this your land?”

“You needn’t worry about that, lad. It doesn’t matter who I am or where I came from, but I would ask you to listen to me now, and listen carefully. You can keep that if you kill me with it.”

He shrugged. I stared.

“Pardon.” I said.

“The dagger. You want it. I can tell.”

“Yeah... look, I ought to get going. If you’ll excuse me.”

I climbed toward the hollow’s entryway and went to pass this strange man, who stood smiling and was perfectly affable in posture. Then, quick as a snake, he grabbed my shoulders and pushed me down the short slope. I flew backwards and landed hard in the shallows of the pool. I blinked and choked, winded and blinded by grit. Then I saw his broad, weathered face loom over me, eyes wild and lips pursed. He grabbed me by the collar and dragged me further into the pool, pushing me down. I fought and kicked. Spat, spluttered and swallowed water. Convulsed and drowned. Unthinking, my right hand slammed the tip of the dagger through his shirt and under his rib cage once, twice, three, four times. The strength in his rod-like arms failed and he fell forward. I splashed out from under him and crawled to the bank, panting and retching. Over my shoulder, I saw the grey-haired man floating face-down in the pool, a cloud of crimson dissipating from the wounds I’d given him. I lurched to my feet and waded out. Spinning him over, I saw the blank stare of a dead man and a row of yellow teeth as taut facial muscles dragged the corners of his mouth upward.

I shoved the dagger down the back of my waistband and ran home. Trembling, and with numb fingers, I unlocked the door. My brain was still offline as I buzzed around the shadowed rooms. I put the knife in a kitchen cupboard and slumped against a wall, rocking and crying and murmuring. Eventually, I fell unconscious on the hardwood floor.

I woke to a persistent whispering, despite being alone. Around the curtain’s edge, the red light of evening shone. Red like the blood of the man I’d killed. Did that happen, or was it drunken delirium? I rose and timidly opened the cupboard to see the cold twinkle of a sapphire in the pommel of a dagger whose blade was dirtied by somebody’s lifeblood. I let the cupboard door softly close. It’s tied to me now, or I’m tied to it. I wondered at the dead man’s smile as he floated in the pool. He’d seemed relieved. Freed. I heard another whisper. There, and gone just as quick.
