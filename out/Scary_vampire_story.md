Title:  Toadsuc's Plot:  The Awokening

Author's Note:  This is a true story.  It happened to me many years ago.  I still have PTSD-related nightmares.  Also, I remain in fear for my mortal soul as I am terrified that some of the beings described in my story may still be on the hunt.  Therefore, I am telling this story in the third-person in order to not give away my identity.  I have fictionalized the location of this story.  Any resemblance to any previously-published works of fiction is purely coincidental.  Again, I cannot stress enough that this is a true story and the events therein unfolded as I am about to tell.  

Another Author's Note:  In the film or mini-series version (finger's crossed!) of this tale, the characters should be of at least above-average to striking good looks.  This should lure in viewers of all ages and sexual persuasion.

It's now time to begin my tale of horror.  Please read on, Casual Reader.

In northern Maine there is a small town named Toaduc.  It is pronounced To-Add-Such and is derived from the language of the now-extinct (go Caucasian's) Mi'kmaq native peoples.  Toadsuc's name roughly translates into "gurl, tighten your tuck."  It is a bastion of the LGBTQ+ community in the entire state of Maine.  It boasts a disproportionate number of gay, lesbian, and/or drag clubs.

Our story should be a fabulous one;  however, the very gaiety of the town has attracted to attention of an unspeakably evil entity.  His name is Curt Barley and he is a vampire.  Being a vampire would make him evil enough but what further blackens his soul are the facts that he drives a Tesla and supports Donald Trump.  He has resided somewhere in Eastern Europe for untold centuries.  He yearns to transition into his female alter-ego whom he calls "Curtina Blow."  Weary of masking his true nature, he has been combing the internet for a new, more free-wheeling place that he can call home.  Upon stumbling across Toadsuc's Plot on the "FreeToBe" travel website, he packs up and makes the perilous journey across the sea to his new home.  Accompanying him is his faithful companion of many years named Baker.  (Author's Note:  I was never told what Baker's first name was, so he'll remain just Baker.)

We now meet Marcus Petridisch.  He is a gay 14-year old who often displays thoughts and abilities beyond his young years.  Marcus lives with his parents in a recently renovated 4,000 square foot farmhouse.  His father works from home as a freelance translator of ancient Sumerian text.  His mother is an international banker.  She works from home three days a week but is otherwise forced to commute to her office.  Author's Note:  Marcus' parents have these types of jobs because who needs parents who are car dealers, cops, postal workers and the like.  Boring.  And besides, those people are poor, amiright?)  (Author's Note:  I have not given names to the parents because I was never told what they were, but they should  be something exotic like Marsha and Paul.)  (And another Author's Note:  I don't know what ethnic background Marcus and the 'rents are but, not give away any identities, they are anything but Caucasian.)

Marcus has a best friend named Danielle Gluck, also age 14, who has recently transitioned from Danny or Daniel.  She is paraplegic.  She is a popular make-up and lifestyle influencer on TikTok.  Danielle's little brother is named Chuck, age 11.  There is much friction between Danielle and Chuck, as Danielle suspects that Chuck is straight.  Chuck vehemently denies this but his straightness is evidenced at times by his love of country-western music and his crush on Marjorie Taylor-Green, whom he calls "rad."  (Author's note:  Danielle and Chuck are probably Caucasian since they have all of the other bases covered.  I'm not going to bother mentioning their parents as I don't feel like it.)

Now it's time to introduce another character, that of Ken Beers.  He is an extremely wealthy twenty-something to mid thirties straight Caucasian.  He is a successful author (again, in an effort to maintain anonymity, I can't say what genre.)  Ken has lost his passion for writing the untimely demise of his wife Brenda.  She was riding as a passenger that Ken was driving and was killed when the scooter collided with a school bus.  Ken was absolved of any fault for the accident as the State Trooper on the scene testified that the school bus "came out of nowhere."  Ken lived in Toadsuc's Plot as a child with his late Aunt Mindy who was a lesbian.  He has returned to this childhood home to, hopefully, rekindle his writing career and forget about his deceased wife.  (Author's Note:  Brenda is of unknown ethnic origin.  It doesn't matter because we never meet her.  She's just dead.)

Meanwhile, Barley and Baker have settled into their new surroundings by purchasing a run-down Mid-Century home (with lots of potential!) located on a blighted patch of ground that overlooks the town.  In a remarkable twist of fate, this is the very home where Ken and his Aunt Mindy lived in the past.  Things soon take a dark turn.  Several members of the community have mysteriously disappeared.  (Author's Note:  In the event of the development of a film or mini-series these characters can be developed.  In the meantime, I must keep their identities shielded.)  The most notable disappearance must be discussed, as it is pivotal to the rest of the story.  Marcus's beloved best friend, Danielle has disappeared.  Danielle's brother Chuck has also disappeared but as far as this story is concerned it' not that big of a deal.  Presumably, Danielle and Chuck's parents are distraught over these events, but, if you recall, I'm not getting too involved with their characters.

Marcus is in deep mourning over the loss of Danielle.  One night, while sitting at the dining room table with his parents, Marcus expresses his fear over the hijinks that occurring within the town.  His parents try to minimize his concerns by telling him that he's just upset by Danielle's disappearance.  Suddenly, one of the windows in their newly renovated kitchen (white cabinets with lots of open shelving) implodes.  Marcus and his parents dash into the kitchen to find Curt Barley himself standing there.  Marcus's parents are revolted by this development, especially considering the kitchen clean-up this will involve.  Barley chuckles in a most evil fashion and gleefully murders Marcus's parents.  Marcus leaps forward to attack Barley by quickly realizes that he is no match for the wily, ancient being.  Barley again chuckles evilly and invites Marcus to join him in the dark abyss of his existence.  Marcus adamantly refuses this offer.  Barley is perturbed at Marcus's response.  While Marcus is pondering his next maneuver he reaches into his right front pocket.  His fingers close over an object.  He withdraws the object from his pocket and realizes that is is Danielle's favorite eye shadow palette.  It is PAC Cosmetics "Tulip" collection for spring.  The palette begins to glow with an eldritch light.  Marcus thrusts the palette toward Barley and shouts at the top of his lungs "your make-up looks terrible!!"  This brings tears to Barley's eyes.  He shouts at Marcus "that's not true, you brat!  I'll make you pay for saying that.!"  He then begins sobbing uncontrollably and flings himself out of the broken window into the blackness of the night.

While all of the above events have been transpiring, Ken has bee re-familiarizing himself with his old home town.  He has found lodging in a boarding house run by a sassy, non-Caucasian individual named Venus DeUranus.  Venus uses they/them pronouns.  They are tickled to be renting a room to a straight Caucasian as they feel this will give them street cred.

One afternoon, Ken is inexplicably drawn to his local home-improvement center even though he currently doesn't have a home to improve.  While aimlessly browsing in the store he has a serendipitous encounter with Muffy Diver, his former middle-school shop teacher.  Muffy is an absolutely stunning biological woman with a lazy left eye.  She is a butch lesbian.  She is fearless with a heart of gold.  She is at the home-improvement center buying replacement shingles for her roof.  She lives in a small ramshackle two-story house on the outskirts of town.  (Author's Note:  Muffy's house is not that great because she's a schoolteacher and those people are also poor.)  Ken confesses to Mindy that he feels that their reconnection is more than a coincidence.  They spend several minutes catching up on old times and also discussing the strange disappearance in "The Plot" as Toadsuc's Plot is colloquially known.  Just then, they spy Baker prancing around the bathroom fixture section of the store.  Ken and Muffy both agree that Baker gives them the heebie-jeebies.  They also find it peculiar that Barley has never been seen in town.  In a remarkable leap of understanding they determine that Barley is a vampire and Baker is his half-human minion.  They agree to grab a bit of lunch and then pay a visit to Barley and Baker on the pretext of inviting them to the opening of a new club in town called "Twinkle Toes."

Since Ken and Muffy have inexplicably dilly-dallied, it is nearing dark when they arrive at their destination.  Unbeknownst to them, Marcus has vowed to defeat Barley without any assistance from anyone else.  He feels his own wits will be enough.  Ken and Muffy enter the house (as quietly as they can) through a glass patio door which Muffy is able to open using a crowbar.  To their surprise, Marcus is already inside the house.  He has killed Baker using a heavy brass Mid-Century lamp.  The trio decides to join forces.   They determine that the most likely pace for Barley to be hiding is in the basement.  It is with great resolve that they advance toward what may be their certain doom.  Upon entering the basement, they find that is is almost pitch black.  It did not occur to our heroes to bring along a flashlight or weapon.  They are stymied.  They discuss returning when they are better prepared when suddenly, from a corner of the basement, they see the terrifying visage of Curt Barley.  Barley says "how do I look now, Marcus?"  Although Marcus is struck by the fact that Barley has completely redone his make-up and does, indeed, look much better, he downplays his approval and responds by shouting "ha! big deal."  Barley informs our intrepid band of vampire hunters that he is going to murder Ken and Muffy and transform Marcus into his new minion.  As he begins to shashay toward them in a most menacing fashion Muffy calls out "we're not finished yet, cork sucker!"  She reaches into her left boot and pulls out the swithblade knife that she keeps hidden within.  An inner voice compels her to throw the knife to Ken.  The instant that Ken's hand makes contact with the knife, the weapon begins to glow with the light of the sun.  Ken thrusts the knife into Barley's black heart.  Barley dies a protracted and horrible death.  Soon, all that is left is a pile of dust an a pair of false eyelashes.

Moving forward several months......Toadsuc's Plot has returned to former self.  Ken has come to accept that, alas, his writing days are over.  However, he's happier than he's ever been.  He has purchased Barley and Baker's home (which if the sharp-eyed reader remembers, Ken lived in this very same house in his younger years.)  He has adopted Marcus.  After a failed attempt at a romantic relationship with Muffy, they remain the best of platonic friends.

The End??  I hope you've enjoyed my story.  By finally telling my tale after many years of silence, I'm hoping that this will finally bring me peace and allow me to sleep at night.
