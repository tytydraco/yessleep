I work in a haunted storage facility (I think)

So let me start this off by saying I have always been a skeptic. Paranormal shows on tv never caught my interest and in all honesty, they are horseshit. I’m also not into horror; it just doest interest me. Things that go bump in the night are fiction- or so I thought. I am still confused and don’t know what to make of the past few weeks, so I am coming here. Hopefully someone on Reddit can debunk all this shit better that I could, God knows I’ve tried. 

Let me backup and give you some context before I get too deep into this shitshow. 

I work in the self storage industry. I have actually had this job for about three years now and finally got promoted to general manager, which means I got my own facility. I was lucky enough to get a new build too- which makes this all the more strange. 

To give a brief rundown of my job, I and my assistant manager run the facility. About twice a week I am alone, and she is alone twice a week as well. We spend about half our time in the office and the rest on the property. Being a new facility, it is all climate controlled - 3 stories and 748 units. The building is long and has two elevators. One at the north loading area and the other at the south. The office sits almost in the middle. 

It has been about four months since I started here; I came on a couple of months after the facility opened. The original manager suddenly transferred which is strange because typically managers who open a facility are required to be on for 6 months before being eligible to transfer. But that is neither here nor there- I don’t know what his exact situation was. 

When I first started everything seemed normal. Coming from older and creepier facilities, this was a shiny new penny. I was excited to finally have my own store and break in a new facility. We were only about 10% occupied at the time. The first few days were fine. I got to know the facility and customers, and reorganized the supply unit and break room to my liking. 
 
Since my assistant manager was helping another facility at the time, I spent my first week flying solo. This is when I had my first unexplainable experience. 

It was a random weekday and I was doing a walk through of the facility, we do two a day. I got to the second floor and began to make my way down the isles when I reached the back row. Suddenly I saw a shadow up ahead. As if someone had walked past the isle. While seeing a shadow of a person in a public setting did not startle me at first, I thought it was strange since I had not seen or heard anyone in the building. I was the only one on site. Once I got back to the office I checked the security system and no one had been in or out. 

Oh, I forgot to mention something important. Customers must have a code to enter the building AND use the elevators. So we can easily tell if someone has been in the building, and what time. 

Like I said before, I was a skeptic before all this. Seeing the shadow made me curious but I was still sure that it had to have been a customer who slipped in and out somehow. When my assistant returned to work with me, I didn’t tell her what had happened. At the time I didn’t see it as important and didn't want to sound stupid. 

A couple of weeks went by with no weird sights or sounds. I had forgotten all about the shadow figure. At least that was until I saw it again in the same area. This time, it hung around for a half second longer. I stopped in my tracks- it was like it saw me. I broke into a fast walk to try and catch up with the person, I needed to see that it was a person. I had to know it was a person. 

When I reached the corner, there was nothing there.  Immediately took the elevator down to the office where my assistant was. I asked if she or anyone had been upstairs. She looked at me confused and shook her head. 

“No I’ve been here and no one’s been in the building since Joe stopped by this morning and his unit is here by the office.” She said looking back at her computer screen. 

I suddenly felt a knot in my stomach. There had to be another explanation for what I saw, right? 

Yasha, my assistant, looked up at me. She could tell I was racing. “Why? Was there something up there?” 

Something? 

I reluctantly sold her what I saw but quickly followed it with “it was probably just the lighting or my imagination”. 

Yasha looked down, then back up at me. “I’ve seen them too. They’ve been here since we opened. Have you heard of anyone yet?” She had a mix of hesitancy and excitement in her voice. It was as if she had wanted to tell me but was waiting for the right time. 

“No, I-I just saw a shadow. What do you mean since we opened?” I was intrigued. 

“Well, I wasn’t going to say anything but weird shit has been happening here since we opened. I even found-” she paused and let out a breath. “I found a burned up bundle of sage on the second floor when we opened it. Like, it had been done during or right after construction or something. I threw it out, but it was weird.”

I couldn’t help but let out a small chuckle. “Sage? No way.” 

Yasha nodded with a smile, like she knew how outrageous it sounded too. 

“Well maybe it was a rich lady who was trying to clear the energy from her stuff or something like that.” I waved my wingers around. 

Yasha laughed. “I know it’s weird right?” She grew quiet. “But like, what if there's something to it?” She shrugged. 

“Naw, just superstition.” 

Part of me was relieved that I was not crazy, but the other half grew more concerned. What if I wouldn’t debunk this? What if there was something weird going on? 


That was three weeks ago. Since then I have not seen another shadow but I heard them this afternoon. Just like Yasha had asked. I heard women on the second floor and they were having a conversation. I couldn’t make out what they said but I know what I heard. I was in that same back row, coming around the corner. Before I could make it, I heard them talking. It was low enough to be unable to make out words, but I heard two distinct female voices. You can probably guess that by the time I turned the corner there was no one there. And yes, I was the only one in the building. 

So, now that you are caught up, what do I do? The skeptic in me still wants to believe this is all just strange coincidences or maybe I am losing my mind…along with Yasha. 

Any advice or ideas of what this is would be appreciated. I will also keep everyone updated with any new…events. 

Thanks,

Ann.
