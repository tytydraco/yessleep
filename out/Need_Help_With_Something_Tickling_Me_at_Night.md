Okay, trust me, I didn’t graduate from high school but I’m not a COMPLETE idiot. I know when things are weird and this is pretty weird, so I need some help. Just like the title says, something’s been tickling me once I fall asleep. I’ve been going crazy trying to figure out what the hell is happening and I figured maybe you guys would know considering you all seem like people who would know about something like this.


For some background context, I’m a pretty young woman living alone in the East Coast. I’m trans, and my parents kicked me out when I started “living wrong,” so I never got my degree. I do sex work now to make a living. It’s not exactly glamorous work, but without familial support or a high school degree my only other option was trying to be a YouTuber or something.


Anyway, it all started a month or so ago. I got home from grocery shopping pretty late, around 8PM or so. I had the day off since it was a Sunday so I figured I might as well take the chance to get some extra sleep. 
I took a quick shower, got in my bed, and fell asleep pretty quickly. 


 But at some point in the night I woke up. I’ve never had sleep paralysis before but it was kind of similar to what I think it’s like. I felt conscious, but I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even open my eyes. The thing is, I could feel my whole body. I felt something start to tickle my feet and I felt every bit of it.


I say tickling, but it was really almost like scratching. It was really light one second and then like someone was clawing at my feet the next.


I felt so fucking terrified. It was this deep, primal fear. I think everyone’s probably had a nightmare about something like this happening to them. I did too when I was little. But it was actually happening to me in that moment and I didn’t know what to do. A part of me was grateful that I couldn’t open my eyes. I don’t know what I would’ve saw.


When I woke up, I honestly thought it was a nightmare or something, because my house seemed fine. I actually checked around to see if anyone had broken in, but no one had, or at least, nothing seemed like it. My door was unlocked, but my only pair of keys was in my drawer, so I must’ve just forgotten to lock it. Unless someone had my apartment keys, it would’ve been impossible to get in. I live on the third floor and unless fucking foot fetish Spider-Man broke into my house I have no clue how a person could’ve gotten in.


The only problem was, it didn’t stop. It was every single night after that night. It didn’t matter when I went to sleep, I would feel that damn tickling sensation. I tried pulling an all-nighter, but I eventually fell asleep and it was back.


I know some of you will ask, oh, why didn’t I install a camera or something? Or get someone else to help? Well, the thing is, I did. I got one of those cheap cameras you use to keep an eye on babies and installed it in my room at a bird’s eye angle the day after it first happened. I went to bed, felt the tickling again, but then when I woke up and checked the footage, there was nothing there! It literally felt like I was going insane. I knew what had happened but the proof was right there and it contradicted me.


And yes, I thought about calling the police. But considering I’m a prostitute and that’s illegal, I’m honestly more afraid of the police than I am of whatever’s happening.


So, I shrugged it off and decided maybe it was just me feeling weird or having some bad dreams or something. Yes, I know how fucking stupid that sounds in retrospect, but I mean, what else was I going to do? It was way easier for me to tell myself that it was just something wrong with me than anything else.


But it just kept getting worse. I tried to limit sleeping as much as possible. I probably consumed enough coffee for the average American’s lifetime. I used clips to pinch myself when I got sleepy. It worked, a little, but only for a few days before I’d eventually fall asleep again. And I was so sleep-deprived and irritable because of it that it affected every single part of me. I was doing badly at my job, my friends started to avoid me, and it really felt like my life was starting to fall apart.


And the worst part is I know it’s real. I know it’s real because I’ve started getting scabs all over the soles of my feet. I’m not really a physically active person, I don’t go to the gym, so how the fuck am I getting those if this isn’t real?
So I called one of my close friends, let’s call him Jake, to try and see if he could help me out.


I’ve known Jake for a long time. He’s been my best friend pretty much ever since I was little. When I started transitioning in high school he was my biggest supporter. Honestly, he always came off as one of the weird jock types, you know, the almost-homophobic-but-not-quite-guys who play football? So it was really surprising when he was supportive. We both grew up in a very conservative area so his support meant the world to me. He always made me feel pretty.


So when I moved out to the east coast, I kind of half-expected him to follow me, and he did. We do practically everything together these days, from getting dinner to rooming together to even taking this protein shake thing that he got me on. We’re not dating, but we’re super close. He was really the only person I trusted to not call me crazy with something like this, and he lives pretty close by, so it wasn’t too hard to convince him to do it for me.
I got home from work the day I decided to talk to him and gave him a call from my cellphone. It took a few rings for him to pick up.


“Jake?”


“Yeah? What is it?”


It probably sounds pretty silly, but it was good to hear his voice again. We had grown more distant ever since it started and it was just reassuring to hear him.


“Well…” I paused a little and tried to think of a way to phrase it that didn’t sound insane. “Someone’s been doing something to me at night. I know how that sounds, but it’s not…you know, I just…I think someone’s breaking in or something and could use some help.”


Jake was silent for a bit before he said, “Sure, I’ll be there. I know I’d be creeped the fuck out if someone was tickling me at night, so I got you.”


Let me tell you, as soon as he agreed to come over I was so relieved. He came over, we got some pizza and played some games together, and then when it was dark outside I asked him to sit right outside my door and see if anything happened. We also set up a shit ton of cameras so there wasn’t a single blind spot in my entire apartment.


Then I fell asleep. And I shit you not, it happened again. I had tucked my feet inside my covers, like I used to do when I was little and thought that monsters were real, but maybe after an hour I felt the sheets start to move and my feet were exposed. I couldn’t move, same as all the other times.


You can guess what happened next.


I checked the footage once I woke up and it was the same thing as always. There was nothing. I literally could not understand it. Throughout the entire night, looking at the footage, my sheets were even in the same position. I hadn’t even rolled over in my sleep and exposed my feet or anything. I was just sleeping in the same goddamn position the entire night. It was literally impossible for my feet to have been tickled.


Jake was right there outside of my door the entire time, too. And yes, although I’m ashamed to admit it, I even thought maybe he had done it for a moment. But that didn’t make any sense, because the cameras showed he had just been sleeping in front of my door the whole night.


Look, I know I sound batshit insane talking about how something’s been tickling my feet at night. I feel silly just writing this. But it’s driving me crazy. I’m so paranoid I’ve been afraid to be alone in my apartment and I’ve been leaving all my nights on all the time.


So my question is, is there any disease or psychological condition that causes this? Or is there any way someone could be doing this to me? I really don’t think it’s sleep paralysis or anything, it’s just not possible. I can’t afford a therapist or a psychiatrist or whatever and I already said I can’t call the cops so please, anything helps. I just need to get this to stop.
