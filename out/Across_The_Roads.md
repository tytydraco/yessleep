**TRIGGER WARNING: Extreme violence, child harm, dismemberment, torture.** 

ACROSS THE COUNTRY

The day had been a slow, grinding punishment.  
Emily Rose had written forty-three tickets, broken up two bar fights, and taken a punch to the ribs from a drunk who swore the stop sign was “a suggestion.” By the time the moon climbed over the precinct’s flat roof, its light looked thin and accusatory, sliding across the glass like a scalpel.

She pushed through the station’s side door, boots scuffing the tile. The air reeked of sweat, gun oil, and bleach. She dropped into her chair, let her head fall back, and closed her eyes for the first time in sixteen hours.

Then the scream came, raw, animal, ripping straight through the drywall.

Emily was on her feet before she registered moving. The sound came again, closer, from the lobby. She shoved past the duty desk, badge swinging, and burst into the night.

Delgado’s apartment smelled of stale beer and the ghost of cigarettes he swore he’d quit. The television flickered in the dark, volume low, just enough to let the anchor’s voice crawl under his skin.

“Gruesome discovery outside the 19th Precinct tonight. Sources confirm the victim is eight-year-old Anna Swinter, missing since.”

He didn’t need to hear the rest. He’d seen the head. He’d smelled the iron in the mailbox.

On screen, the parents stumbled out of a cruiser. Mr. Swinter clutching his wife like she was the only thing keeping him vertical. Mrs. Swinter’s mouth opened in a silent scream the camera lingered on for three full seconds. Three. Like it was art.

Delgado’s lip curled. “Sick fucks,” he muttered, tipping the bottle back. The beer was warm. Tasted like failure.

He’d been twenty when the first arrow appeared.

A finger in a matchbox. Mailed to a precinct in Baton Rouge.

Note: “tell mommy i tried to wave” ↓

Nine years. Thirty-seven packages. Forty-two victims, if you counted the ones they never found whole.

He stood, swaying, and hurled the bottle at the wall. Glass exploded. Amber liquid slid down the paint like blood.

“WHERE ARE YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH?”

His voice cracked on the last word. He punched the drywall, once, twice, until his knuckles split and the pain felt honest.

He slid down the wall, knees to chest, and let the sobs come. They always did, around 2 a.m., when the city quieted and the ghosts got loud.

His brother’s face floated up. Tommy, twelve years old, gap-toothed grin, always begging to tag along.

“C’mon, Ricky, just to the corner store. I’ll be good.”

But Ricky Delgado, twenty and invincible, had a party to get to. Girls. Music. A fake ID burning a hole in his pocket.

He’d told Tommy to wait on the stoop.

“Ten minutes, tops.”

Ten minutes became three hours.

When he came back, the stoop was empty.

Just Tommy’s sneaker, one lace untied, lying on its side like it was napping.

They found the first piece three days later.

A toe.

Wrapped in Spider-Man wrapping paper.

Note: “he won’t need these to run anymore” ↓

Delgado pressed his bloody knuckles to his forehead. “I should’ve stayed. I should’ve.”

The TV cut to commercial. A smiling family eating cereal. Like the world still worked.

He laughed, a wet, broken sound. “You took babies. Grandmas. That marathon runner in Denver. Cut her Achilles so she couldn’t finish. You mailed her feet to the finish line.”

He crawled to the coffee table, yanked open a drawer, and pulled out an evidence bag. Inside: a single playing card. The Queen of Hearts. On the back, in red ink:

find the rest before i find you  
↓

It had arrived last week. No postmark. Just slid under his door while he was at the gym.

He turned the card over and over, like the answer might appear if he stared long enough.

His pager buzzed. Rose.

He let it ring out. Then again. On the third try, he answered the pay phone down the hall.

“Yeah.”

“Delgado, it’s me.” Emily’s voice was tight, like she’d been running. “We got a hit. Print on the mailbox. It’s in the system. Old case, 1991, juvenile. Name’s redacted, but the file’s flagged ‘Arrow Task Force.’ Guess who signed the original report?”

He closed his eyes. “Me.”

“You were a rookie. You interviewed a witness. Kid saw a man in a station wagon. Gave a description. Then the file vanished. Someone buried it. There was a second file: girl, born without arms, case closed as ‘runaway.’ You never saw it.”

Delgado’s pulse thudded in his ears. “Give me the address.”

“Already scribbled it on the back of your pager message. And Delgado?”

“Yeah?”

“Bring your gun. This ends tonight.”

He hung up, stared at the Queen of Hearts, then at the photo pinned above his TV. Him and Tommy at the county fair, cotton candy stuck in Tommy’s hair.

He grabbed his holsters, badge, and the card.

“I’m coming, Tommy,” he whispered to the empty room. “I’m late. But I’m coming.”

The door slammed behind him. The TV kept playing. The anchor had moved on to weather. Clear skies tomorrow.

125 NORTH PINEWOOD TERRACE, 3:17 a.m., October 26, 1999.

The moon had slipped behind a bruise-colored cloud, and the bungalow on the ridge looked like a broken tooth against the sky. Delgado’s cruiser fishtailed on the gravel turnout, headlights catching the swirl of red-blue strobes already parked crooked across the lawn.

He killed the engine and stepped out. The air tasted of pine sap and old blood.

Two uniforms flanked the sagging porch. One of them, Officer Park, lifted the crime-scene tape without a word. His face was the color of dishwater.

“Detective,” Park muttered. “He’s escalating. Hard.”

Emily Rose emerged from the doorway, latex gloves slick to the elbow. Her ponytail had come half-undone; strands stuck to the sweat on her neck. She didn’t bother with hello.

“Inside,” she said. “You’ll want to see it before the techs start bagging.”

Delgado followed her through the splintered front door. The house had belonged to Nellie Parks, 78, “Neighborhood Hero” for knitting 1,000 blankets. Now it was a single, perfect tableau.

Living room: Nellie sat upright on her floral sofa, hands folded in her lap.

At first glance she looked asleep.

At second glance she was a quilt of herself.

Her torso had been hollowed, ribs splayed like wings. Arms and legs: her own: flayed to the bone in places, pinned to the cushions with upholstery nails. A knitted blanket draped her shoulders like a cape.

The head was missing.

On the coffee table: a bowl of soggy Cheerios in thick, dark milk. Ten feet away, on a plastic lawn chair, sat an infant. Pristine white onesie. Nailed to the chair through the palms with newspaper. Eyes open, filmed, fixed on the ceiling.

In the hallway: two severed child’s legs in a red plastic wagon, feet in glittery jelly shoes.

Another note, pinned to the wagon handle with a diaper pin:

don’t worry mommy i found them in the lost-and-found  
they were waiting for the 3:10 bus  
tell the conductor i said hi  
↓

Delgado felt the room tilt. He braced a hand on the doorframe.

Emily’s pager chirped. She checked the numeric display, face hardening. “Greyhound station downtown just got a package. Cooler. Addressed to ‘Daddy’s Little Helper.’”

Delgado stared at the jelly shoes. “He’s playing house. Whole damn country’s his dining room.”

Emily stepped closer, voice low. “We’re not chasing parts anymore, Rick. We’re guests at his table. And he just set another place.”

Delgado pulled the Queen of Hearts from his pocket. Flipped it so Emily could see the back.

Table for three. Bring the legs.  
↓

Emily met his eyes. “Clock’s ticking. Next course is already cold.”

Delgado holstered the card like a bullet. “Then we don’t keep him waiting.”

GREYHOUND DEPOT, DAWN

The depot smelled of diesel and wet cardboard. A single cooler sat on the baggage carousel, spinning slow, labeled: DADDY’S LITTLE HELPER: FRAGILE.

Emily stood with Delgado and Ramirez, forming a tight triangle. CSI had photographed. Now it waited.

Ramirez broke the silence. “Why’s he talking like a kid who flunked phonics?”

Emily didn’t look up from the note taped to the lid.

daddy i waited at the bus stop like you said  
but the driver said i need legs to ride  
so i gave him mommy’s  
tell him sorry they smell like milk  
↓

Delgado traced the arrow. “It’s not sloppy. It’s deliberate. Every misspelling’s a time-stamp.”

Ramirez frowned. “Meaning?”

“Meaning the day he learned ‘because’ was the day someone stopped reading to him.” Emily’s voice was soft, almost clinical. “He’s writing from the last grade he finished. Or the last one that finished him.”

Delgado nodded. “Look at the numbers in the Pinewood note. n125125125235pwts2. Not random. He’s counting something. Locker combos, bus routes, ages. He wants us to think it’s a map.”

Ramirez shifted. “Or he’s just screwing with us.”

“No,” Emily said. “Screwing with us would be silence. This is conversation. He’s testing if we speak his language.”

Delgado pulled the Queen of Hearts. Laid it beside the cooler note. Same ink. Same pressure.

Ramirez leaned in. “Wait. That card came to you personally?”

“Slid under my door. No stamp.” Delgado’s jaw worked. “He knows my route home. Knows I drink alone. Knows I still keep Tommy’s photo on the fridge.”

Emily’s eyes narrowed. “Every note references a ‘lost’ part. Legs in the hallway. Head in the mailbox. Now legs on a bus. He’s not hiding the bodies. He’s curating them. Like a kid leaving clues in a scavenger hunt nobody asked to play.”

Ramirez swallowed. “So the arrow.”

“Isn’t a signature,” Delgado cut in. “It’s a compass. He thinks he’s pointing us toward something we missed. Toward him.”

Emily tapped the cooler. “Or toward what he thinks we owe him.”

A tech wheeled the cooler away. The carousel kept turning, empty now, a slow mechanical shrug.

Ramirez watched it go. “If he’s stuck at, what, second grade? Third? Then the locations aren’t random either. Bus stops. Playgrounds. Schools with numbers in the address.”

Delgado’s pager buzzed again. Unknown callback: 555-0199. He showed Emily the screen.

did you find her shoes yet  
↓

Emily’s breath caught. “He’s at a pay phone.”

Delgado dialed the pay phone outside the depot. It rang once.

“Which pair?” he asked.

A childlike voice, crackling through the handset:

the glitter ones  
they still have playground dirt  
tell tommy i kept the left one  
↓

Click. Dial tone.

Ramirez stared. “He knows your brother’s name.”

Delgado’s voice was gravel. “He’s been reading my mail for nine years.”

Emily grabbed a marker, started scribbling on the evidence board. Columns: WORD CHOICE / AGE / LOCATION / ARROW DIRECTION. She underlined playground dirt twice.

“We stop treating the notes like taunts,” she said. “We treat them like diary entries. He’s regressing in public. Every scene is a page he can’t tear out.”

Ramirez hesitated. “So we… what? Profile an eight-year-old with a box cutter?”

“No,” Delgado said. “We profile the adult who never left that eight-year-old behind. And we follow the arrow until it points at the door he’s afraid to open.”

Emily capped the marker. “Starting with every elementary school in a fifty-mile radius. Bus routes that still run past them. Lockers with busted combos. We map the places a kid could hide and never be found.”

Delgado looked at the empty carousel, still turning.

“Then we stop looking for a monster,” he said. “We start looking for the classroom he never graduated from.”

Ramirez exhaled. “And if we find it?”

Emily met his eyes. “We ring the bell. And we don’t leave until he comes out for recess.”

SQUAD ROOM, MORNING

Six chairs scraped around a conference table that hadn’t been wiped down since the Reagan administration. Coffee had gone cold in Styrofoam cups; nobody drank.

Emily sat at the head, elbows on the table, fingers laced so tight the knuckles blanched.

Ramirez was opposite her, shoulders folded inward like a broken umbrella.

Delgado leaned against the wall, arms crossed, eyes on the floor.

The blood-spatter analyst, Nguyen, kept turning a single evidence photo over and over.

Two uniforms, Park and a rookie whose name no one could remember, sat silent, faces the color of printer paper.

On the table: a paper map of the county tacked to corkboard, push-pins in every color of grief.

Red for torsos.  
Blue for heads.  
Yellow for the pieces too small to identify without DNA.  
Green for the notes.

There were thirty-seven green pins.

They looked like a constellation no one wanted to name.

Ramirez’s voice cracked the quiet. “Everything looks… pale.”

He held a photocopy of last night’s note, edges trembling in his grip.

i made a snowman but he melted in the sun  
so i gave him new arms from the neighbor  
he still smiles  
↓

Emily didn’t look up. “We pulled forty-two parts out of one house. Forty-two. In one night.”

Her voice was sandpaper. “He’s not hiding anymore. He’s curating.”

Nguyen set the photo down. It was a child’s hand, palm up, fingers curled like it was waiting for a high-five. A crayon drawing had been stapled to the wrist: stick-figure family, all holding hands. One figure had no head.

Park cleared his throat. “News choppers were over Pinewood before we finished processing. Vultures.”

Delgado pushed off the wall. “They’ll run the footage on loop until ratings dip. Then they’ll blame us for not catching him faster.”

Silence pooled again.

Ramirez unfolded the note, smoothed it flat. His lips moved as he read it to himself, like a prayer he didn’t believe in.

Emily noticed. “You’ve been staring at that one for ten minutes, Ramirez. Talk.”

He startled, cheeks flushing. “It’s… nothing.”

“Bull.” Delgado’s tone was gentle, but it still cut. “Spit it out.”

Ramirez’s fingers worried the paper’s corner until it tore. “When I was twelve, I saw the first Arrow story on the news. A foot in a lunchbox. I thought… I thought it was the most perfect crime I’d ever heard of. Clean. No witnesses. Just the note and the arrow.” He laughed, a small, sick sound. “I decided that day I’d be a cop. To understand how someone could be that… precise.”

The room didn’t flinch. They were too tired for judgment.

Nguyen spoke first. “Precision’s a hell of a drug.”

Ramirez nodded. “I keep thinking, if I can just read one more note, ask one more question, he’ll tell me why. Like he owes me the answer.” He looked up, eyes glassy. “My mom said I was obsessed. That I needed therapy. Maybe she was right.”

Emily reached across, laid her hand over his. “He doesn’t owe us anything. That’s the trap. He wants us to beg.”

Delgado moved to the map, tapped a cluster of green pins near an old elementary school. “Every location’s within walking distance of a bus stop that hasn’t changed routes since ’91. Same year my first report vanished.”

Park frowned. “You think he’s circling the same neighborhood?”

“I think he never left it,” Delgado said. “We’re the ones who keep moving.”

Nguyen pulled a fresh sheet, started sketching. “Grammar regression, arrow vectors, bus routes, milk in cereal bowls. None of it random. He’s reciting a schedule. A childhood schedule.”

Emily stood. “Then we go back to school.”

Ramirez looked up. “Literally?”

“Field trip,” she said. “Abandoned elementary on Maple. Closed since ’92. Bus stop still active. Locker banks intact. We walk every hallway. We read every scuff mark like it’s another note.”

Delgado was already shrugging into his coat. “And if he’s waiting?”

Emily met his eyes. “Then recess is over.”

Ramirez folded the note carefully, slipped it into his pocket like contraband.

He stood, legs unsteady but moving.

“One more question,” he said to no one and everyone. “Just one.”

The six of them filed out, boots echoing down the corridor.

Behind them, the map stayed lit under the fluorescents, pins glowing like tiny, patient eyes.

PINEWOOD BASEMENT, LATER

Dogs lost the scent in a creek. Helicopter flyovers came back with deer. Every officer moved like they were underwater.

Then Ramirez’s voice cracked over the radio:

“Basement. Old root cellar. False panel behind the shelves. Kid’s here. Alive.”

They found her in a hollow beneath the house, curled inside a plastic toy box lined with Nellie’s blankets.

No arms.

No legs.

No eyes. Sockets sewn shut with pink embroidery thread.

No ears. Just smooth skin stretched over the holes.

The stumps were pale, hairless, healed.

Not cauterized.

Not scabbed.

Healed.

The antiseptic smell was fresh. Someone had cared for her recently.

Like the limbs had never been there.

Ramirez dropped to his knees. “Jesus… how long.”

Emily checked the pulse. Steady.

The child’s chest rose and fell in perfect, mechanical rhythm.

A faint smell of baby shampoo and antiseptic.

Delgado’s flashlight trembled. “These wounds are months old. Maybe years. He’s been… keeping her.”

The girl turned her head toward the sound of his voice. Blind, deaf, but aware.

Her lips moved. No sound. Just shaping a word over and over.

Emily leaned close.

“Mommy.”

Emily stepped back into the cruiser, locked the doors, and screamed until her throat bled.

Beyond the false panel, a narrow door, child-sized, painted sky-blue, stood ajar.

Emily went first.

The room beyond was no bigger than a closet.

Walls lined with pegboard.

Hooks.

Hundreds of hooks.

On them:

Children’s shoes.

Tiny socks rolled into pairs.

A single baby tooth on a red string.

Polaroids pinned like butterflies. Smiling faces, then the same faces with parts missing.

A mobile made of finger bones, spinning slow in the draft.

In the center: a low table.

On it, bodies.

Stacked like cordwood.

Small.

Some still in pajamas.

Some in school uniforms.

All missing pieces.

All arranged in a perfect circle, holding hands with what was left of their arms.

Emily made it three steps in before her knees gave.

She vomited against the wall, retching until there was nothing left but bile and sobs.

Delgado stood frozen in the doorway.

One officer behind him simply walked out, dropped his badge in the dirt, and kept walking.

Another sat on the porch steps and cried into his radio.

A third called his wife and quit on the spot.

Ramirez didn’t enter.

He just whispered, “This isn’t a hideout. It’s a museum.”

At the far end of the room, above the circle of children, hung a single sheet of thick art paper.

No yellow legal sheet.

No arrow.

No childish scrawl.

Just a portrait.

Done in charcoal and colored pencil, police-sketch perfect.

An old man.

Seventy-five, hair in a neat silver ponytail, round glasses catching the fluorescent light.

A gentle, grandfatherly smile.

Emily wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, stared up at it through tears.

“That’s Richard Jons,” she rasped. “Retired city engineer. Lived two blocks from the first drop. His face was in the 1991 file on the girl born without arms.”

Her voice came out raw, barely human.

TUESDAY, RAIN-SMELL

A single Polaroid appeared on Emily’s desk.

No envelope.

No prints.

Just the photo: an empty elementary school cafeteria.

Long tables.

One place set.

A bowl of cereal, milk still fresh.

A yellow legal note beside it:

lunch bell rings at noon  
bring your appetite  
table for one  
↓

The arrow pointed at the lens.

The school had been closed since 1992.

Address: Maple Street Elementary.

Same building they’d cleared twice.

They rolled in at 11:57 a.m.

Full SWAT.

Snipers on the roof.

News choppers kept at a distance by uniformed air patrol.

Delgado led the stack.

Emily behind him.

Ramirez brought up the rear, hands shaking so hard he nearly dropped his rifle.

They breached the cafeteria doors at 11:59.

He was already there.

Richard Jons sat at the head of the table, 75 years old, hair in a neat silver ponytail, round glasses catching the fluorescent light.

A china teacup steamed in his liver-spotted hands.

A double-barrel shotgun rested across his lap like a sleeping cat.

The room smelled of cinnamon and gun oil.

Officers fanned out, weapons up.

“FREEZE! HANDS WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM!”

Richard smiled. Gentle, grandfatherly, the same smile from the charcoal sketch.

His voice was soft, perfect BBC English.

“Good afternoon, officers. You’re right on time.”

Delgado’s finger whitened on the trigger. “Drop the weapon.”

Richard lifted the shotgun, slow, theatrical.

Every muzzle tracked him.

He pulled the trigger.

Click.

Empty.

He laughed. A warm, rolling chuckle, like a bedtime story.

“Oh, dear. I always forget to load the punchline.”

The gun clattered to the tile.

SWAT surged.

Batons.

Boots.

Fists.

Someone’s knee found his spine.

A boot stomped his hand until bones cracked like kindling.

Richard didn’t scream.

He just smiled through the blood.

They dragged him out in cuffs, face swollen, still chuckling.

INTERROGATION ROOM 3

One table.

Two chairs.

Richard sat straight-backed, wrists zip-tied, tea stain on his cardigan.

Ramirez entered alone, closed the door soft.

“Hello, Richard Jons.”

“Hello, sir. How may I assist you on this beautiful day?”

Ramirez sat.

Leaned in.

“Why?”

Richard’s eyes twinkled. “Because I wanted to.”

Ramirez’s voice cracked. “Your backstory, Mr. Jons. Who were you? Why this?”

Richard sighed, theatrical. “You ask such complicated questions, young man. But I’ve grown bored of the game. Nine years is a long season. When I turned aggressive, you found me. Because I chose to be found.”

He leaned forward, voice velvet.

“I did it because it felt good. A sensation beyond language. Like cinema, like sculpture. Every cut, every note, every arrow… a frame in a film only I could screen. And you know it was beautiful. Everyone does. Art is the only honest confession.”

Ramirez swallowed, his throat dry, a shameful heat blooming in his chest. He shouldn’t feel this pull, this electric understanding, but the words landed like recognition. “It… it was good?”

Richard’s smile widened, blood cracking at the corners. “Oh, yes. Better than good. It was release. Pure. You know what I’m talking about, don’t you?”

Ramirez’s gut twisted with guilt, a hot, secret thrill he hated himself for. He leaned closer, voice dropping to a whisper no protocol would allow. “What did the arrows mean to you?”

Richard’s eyes gleamed, locking onto Ramirez like a shared secret. “The arrows was a symbol that i always was curious about this is why i used it as my symbol it was always a mystery when you knew the path but you dont knew what you was going to see when you arive there.”

Ramirez’s breath hitched, the answer burrowing into him like a hook. He should stop, should call it in, but the questions spilled out, weird and hungry, far from any interviewer’s script. “Did it ever… scare you? The first time?”

Richard chuckled softly. “Scare? No, child. It thrilled. Like opening a door you always knew was there but never dared touch.”

“And the kids’ voices in the notes… was that you, really you?”

“Every word. The child I never outgrew. The one the world forgot to feed.”

Ramirez’s hands trembled under the table, guilt gnawing deeper: he was enjoying this, the intimacy of it, the mirror held up to his own dark fascination. One more, he told himself, just one more before he ended it. “If you could send one last arrow… where would it point?”

Richard tilted his head, serene. “To the boy in you who watched that first news story and felt the spark. Right here.” He nodded at Ramirez’s chest. “You know what I’m talking about, don’t you?”

Ramirez stood abruptly, chair scraping, face burning with self-loathing. He’d crossed a line he couldn’t uncross. “I… know it was.”

“See? You speak my dialect.” Richard’s smile was beatific. “I did it for me.”

“Tell me about your life.”

“Born March 12, 1950, in a clapboard house outside Tulsa. Father: a drunk who loved me in slurred verses. Mother: a sad woman who stitched quilts to keep the silence warm. They fought like thunder, loved like rain. School was a coliseum of small cruelties. Children are savages with excellent aim. I still hate them. I ate cereal alone, walked to class alone, bled alone. No friends. No lovers. Only the mirror, and it never lied. I am still alone today.”

“How did it start?”

A shrug. “I don’t remember the first snap. Only the relief. Like stepping out of a burning house into snow.”

“How did you do it?”

Richard’s eyes gleamed. “Children trust a grandfather with butterscotch in his pocket. Adults trust routine: same jog at dawn, same bingo night, same unlocked back door. Muscle is irrelevant when you have patience and a bone saw.”

He lifted a cuff-chained hand, mimed turning a key.

“I never used my own vehicle. I’m a retired civil engineer: city contracts, county blueprints, maintenance schedules. I knew every municipal fleet, every school-bus rotation, every rental lot that kept spare keys under the visor. A different van, a different plate, a different life each time. I’d wear the city’s own coveralls, the city’s own gloves, the city’s own dust.”

A soft chuckle.

“No phone in my name. Pay phones, calling cards, cash. Hairnets, booties, Tyvek suits under the cardigan. I shaved in motel sinks with bottled water, flushed the blades. DNA? I left their DNA: stray hairs from the shelter, fibers from Nellie’s own blankets. You chased ghosts wearing the victims’ own clothes.”

He leaned in, voice velvet.

“I didn’t hide from you. I hid inside you. Every arrow pointed where I’d already been and I never go to the same place that I commit the crime.”

He leaned back, serene.

“You chased arrows I drew on the map of your guilt. Every note was a breadcrumb I placed on your tongue. The cafeteria? My curtain call. You never caught me. I retired.”

Ramirez’s voice was a whisper. “You’re proud.”

Richard’s smile was beatific.

“I am complete.”

The red light blinked.

Recording stopped.

Outside the door, Emily and Delgado watched through the glass.

Ramirez stood, legs trembling. He looked at Richard like a mirror and saw his own reflection smiling back: guilty, tainted, forever changed by the dialogue he’d savored in secret.

Richard Jons just sipped his cold tea, humming a lullaby no one recognized,

waiting for the needle that would finally give him the last frame.

SQUAD ROOM, EMPTY

Delgado sat alone under the buzzing fluorescents, the Queen of Hearts in one hand, the last yellow note in the other.

tell tommy i kept the left one  
↓

The paper trembled between his fingers. Not from fear. From heat. From the furnace that had been building in his chest for nine years, fed by every severed toe, every glittery jelly shoe, every butterscotch wrapper soaked in blood.

He had promised himself he wouldn’t cry again. He lied.

The tears came hot, silent, carving tracks through the grime on his cheeks. He pressed the note to his forehead like it could brand the words into his skull. Like it could bring Tommy back. Like it could make the world make sense.

But the world had stopped making sense the day his brother vanished from that stoop.

Richard Jons was going to die.

Not by needle. Not by some sterile state ritual.

He was going to die wrong.

He was going to die slow.

He was going to die looking into the eyes of the man he’d been haunting since 1990.

Delgado stood so fast the chair rolled back and crashed into the wall. Metal on tile. A gunshot in the quiet.

He didn’t feel his feet move. He was already in the kitchen of his apartment, the one that still smelled like stale beer and regret. The note went into the sink. A flick of the lighter. The flame kissed the corner. The paper curled, blackened, screamed in silence as it turned to ash.

He watched it burn until the last ember died.

Then he opened the drawer. The one with the false bottom. Inside: his service pistol, cleaned and oiled the way Tommy used to clean his toy cap guns. He loaded it with hollow points. One in the chamber. Five more in the mag. Enough.

The drive to county lockup was a blur of red lights he didn’t stop for. Sirens off. Badge on the dash. No one pulled him over. Cops recognize their own when they’re past the point of return.

At the gate, the guard—Martinez, rookie, still had baby fat on his cheeks—looked up, saw Delgado’s face, and didn’t ask questions. Just hit the button. Didn’t buzz anyone.

“Room’s yours, Detective,” he muttered, eyes on the floor.

Delgado didn’t answer.

The hallway smelled like bleach and despair. Fluorescent tubes flickered like they were trying to warn someone. No one was listening.

He pushed through the steel door.

Richard Jons sat at the metal table, wrists chained, ankles bolted to the floor. His face was swollen from the arrest: purple bruises blooming under the glasses, lip split, one eye half-shut. But he was smiling. Still. Always.

“Detective,” he said, voice soft as lullabies. “I was hoping you’d come alone.”

Delgado didn’t speak. He closed the door. Locked it. The click echoed like a round being chambered.

Jons tilted his head. “You look tired, Ricky. Like a man who’s been running in circles. Did you bring Tommy’s sneaker? I kept the other one, you know. In a box. With the laces still tied.”

Delgado’s hand came up slow. The pistol was steady. Black. Heavy. Real.

Jons’ smile didn’t falter. “You’re not going to shoot me. You’re a good cop. You follow rules. You—”

“This one’s for Tommy,” Delgado whispered.

The first shot took him just above the left eye.

No warning. No speech.

Just the roar. The flash. The smell of cordite and copper.

Jons’ head snapped back. The chair tipped. Chains rattled. His body slumped, still tethered, blood pooling fast and dark across the table, dripping onto the floor in perfect, rhythmic drops.

Delgado stood over him. Breathing hard. Watching the light leave those monstrous, twinkling eyes.

He pressed the muzzle to Jons’ heart and fired again. And again. Until the slide locked back empty.

Silence.

He dropped the gun on the table. It landed in the blood with a wet thud.

Alarms started wailing somewhere far away. Boots pounded. Voices shouted.

Delgado didn’t move.

He just stared at the body. At the ruin. At the end of nine years of arrows.

And for the first time since he was twenty years old, he felt the weight lift.

Not peace.

Not forgiveness.

Just done.

The door burst open behind him.

Hands grabbed him.

Shouts.

Cuffs.

He didn’t resist.

As they dragged him out, past the flashing lights and the cameras and the screaming headlines waiting to be born, he looked back once.

The arrow was finally broken.

And Tommy wherever he was could finally stop running.

THE END
