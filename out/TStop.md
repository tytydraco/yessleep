The moment the phone rings, I begin to type the number from the caller ID into the computer to pull up the caller’s account.

“Hi, you’ve reached Circulation, how can I help you?” 

“Yeah, hi,” the scratchy voice of a senior comes through. “I need to pause my delivery.”

“I can take care of that for you right now. Who am I speaking with, please?”

“Vern,” the voice responds. “Banach.” Vern coughs a little, right into the speaker.

“Thanks, Vern, do you receive delivery at 9022 Creek Drive?”

“That’s the one.” More coughing. “Go ahead and stop the paper starting on November 30. We’re heading down to Florida for winter. I’ll call back when we’re on our way up again.”

“Sounds good, Vern, we’ll make sure your last day of delivery is November 29.”

“You do that, thanks. You know we hate newspapers to pile up when we’re not in town, makes it too obvious no one’s home, Susan worries.”

“I totally understand”, I say. “I hope you and Susan enjoy the weather down there!”

Vern laughs. “We will! You enjoy all that snow.”

“I’ll do my best,” I give Vern a little chuckle back as the call ends.

Vern, I think to myself. If you only knew how many times I hear that joke this time of year, and every one of you snowbirds thinks you’re the first ever to come up with it. 

The phone is already ringing. Quickly, I enter the code to place a temporary hold, aka “T-Stop”, on the Banach delivery. It’s all good, Susan, you just go relax in Sarasota.

“Hi, you’ve reached Circulation, how can I help you?”

“Hey sweetheart, it’s Sam. Do me a favor would ya, call the Carters on Old Ranch Road to let them know that I was out to make their delivery this morning, but there was a porcupine on the tube. I’ll drop today’s paper off for them with tomorrow’s.”

I laugh, genuinely tickled. “No way. That’s cute.” Wonders never cease.

“Yes way. Well ma’am, I’ll leave you to it.” Click. Ring. I make a note to myself to report the wildlife delivery issue to the Carters when I get a moment. Ring. Ring. Ring.

“Hi, you’ve reached Circulation, how can I help you?” 

“Good morning,” a woman’s voice this time. “How’s your day going so far honey?”

“Oh hi, Judy,” I smile into the receiver. “Get this, we missed a delivery this morning because a porcupine was on someone’s tube.”

“No way,” Judy and I laugh together for a moment. 

“Yes way. Well ma’am, what can I do for you? Getting ready to pause delivery for winter?”

“Actually, I’m going to stay around for now,” Judy explains. “You know, my daughter and grandkids are here. The boys are getting so big, and I think they’re going to need grandma for a while longer.”

“Aw, I get it. I’m glad you’re looking out for them. Is there anything else I can help you with?”

“Oh,” she pauses. “Actually, I think there was something, but I’m afraid it’s slipped my mind. You know, I’ve been having some health problems lately, and I just haven’t been quite myself.”

“Oh dear, I’m so sorry to hear that. Well, I just want you to know, it’s always a pleasure to take your call, and you can reach me here any time.”

“I appreciate that, dear. You have a good day.”

“Thanks, Judy, you take care now.” Click. Ring, ring.

“Pardon me?” I look up from the computer to see a woman standing at the counter, two children in tow. “I’d like ten copies of the paper from November 15, please.”

“Certainly, I’ll go grab those for you right now. I’ll be back in about five minutes.” I slide the bowl of candy towards her. “Feel welcome to have a seat.”

Despite stale air, the quiet of the basement is a welcome break from the circulation desk. I peruse the labels on the slotted shelf, pull ten copies of the requested paper, and return to my station.

“Ten copies of November 15. $1.00 per paper please, for a total of $10.00.”

The customer hands me a ten-dollar bill. “One more thing please, I need you to stop my mother’s paper.”

“Certainly, what’s the name please?”

“Judy Willis.”

“Judy?” I pause. “I thought she was staying in town this winter, and didn’t want a T-Stop?”

“No… no.” A shadow of grief flickers across the woman’s face. “No, I’m sorry for any confusion. I need to cancel her subscription. My mother has passed away. That’s why I came in, to pick up prints of her obituary.”
