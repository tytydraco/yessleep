When I turned 18, a stranger gifted me a smartphone. I didn't know who he was or where it came from; it was just found on my doorstep. Upon opening the courier, I found a Samarth phone inside. I was surprised and exclaimed loudly for my mom to come down and see what I had received on my birthday.

My mother's reaction was also one of surprise, but she advised me not to use it. I assured her that it was just a phone and that perhaps someone had made a mistake. I decided to keep it until someone came to claim it as theirs. My mother agreed with my decision.

I was curious as the phone seemed old and appeared to have been used before. Firstly, I checked the contact list but found nothing as there was no SIM card in it. Next, I looked through the phone gallery and was surprised to find many weird photos. Each photo seemed to have been clicked randomly, without the subjects' permission. Furthermore, some of the photos had a spooky appearance, with a black, foggy entity wrapping around them and the subjects' faces wearing weird expressions. I couldn't make sense of it all and decided to turn off the phone.

I resolved to figure out what was going on later. In the evening, while watching the news, it was reported that an old man had died in a car crash. I suddenly recognized the man's face on TV while I was eating dinner. I stopped eating and tried to remember where I had seen him before. Then it struck me that I had seen his face that morning while scrolling through the phone gallery, which had been left on my doorstep.

Oh, my God, I exclaimed to myself.

After finishing dinner, I went straight to bed and searched for the phone. I found it and opened the gallery. I saw the old man's photo again, but now it had turned black and foggy. I couldn't believe it. His photo was normal before his death, but now it had changed. Was it what I thought it was? It couldn't be possible.

I scrolled through more photos and checked their clicking dates. The old man's photo was clicked on the same day he died. I was confused. How could this be possible? I had seen those photos before in the phone gallery. Some of the photos seemed to have been taken many years ago, while some had future dates. What did it all mean? Was this phone predicting future deaths? I was scared and wondered who would be next.

A week had passed, and no one had come to claim the phone. In that time, many people in my town had died. I was too afraid to look at the gallery again. I wondered if my own photo was in there. It couldn't be possible. But how did those photos end up in the phone gallery? Was someone clicking them on their own? Did they know the truth about the phone and its lethal capabilities? Maybe, I was wrong. Perhaps, it was all just a coincidence.

Despite feeling frustrated, I decided to find out the truth. I opened the gallery again.


The number of photos remained the same, but many turned black and foggy in just seven days. Does this mean they are dead?

I delved deeper and noted the dates of the black foggy photos which turned in the last seven days. After that, I searched Google for news like car crashes or someone's death on those dates. Surprisingly, I found out that five people in my town had died in the last seven days, and their faces matched those in the gallery photos.

Upon seeing this, I was completely freaked out. Could it be true that this camera predicts people's deaths? However, I doubted how five people could die in one week. Something more must be hidden that I don't know yet.

I researched the causes of death of the five people and discovered that they all had died unexpectedly. Among the five, two died in a car accident, and the remaining three died strangely in their homes, and the cause of death was unknown.

At that moment, I realized that no one was killing anyone. The major deaths were happening naturally. But a new question arose in my head: who took their photos? Someone must have clicked their photos, and that person could be the killer.

The scary part was that someone dropped that phone on my doorstep. Was he the killer? What did he want from me? Why did he choose me?

Many thoughts raced through my head. I couldn't throw away the phone because I was afraid it would come after me. I decided to stay away from the phone and placed it under my bed, covering its camera so that it could not click any photos on my phone.

My mom kept asking me these days if someone had come to take that phone. I lied to her and told her that the phone was taken by its original owner.

One night, while I was sleeping, the phone suddenly vibrated, waking me up. I checked my phone, but it was silent. However, the killer phone was ringing under my bed.

At that moment, I was completely freaked out. I had never seen the phone vibrate so violently before. It was as if it were hungry. Then, a slow whisper came out of the phone's speaker, saying, "I want more photos in my gallery. I want more souls." It repeated these words all night.

I was too scared to look at the phone. I didn't sleep that night and kept shaking on my bed.

The next morning, I looked at my gallery and noticed that all the photos had turned black and foggy. It was evident that the phone had killed all its victims. I finally understood who was behind these gruesome deaths. My mind raced with theories, and I considered the possibility of a demonic entity trapped within the phone.

I was always in a state of fear, unable to concentrate on my studies or anything else, consumed by the thought of how to get rid of this killer phone.

One day, while I was in college, my mom called me. Unfortunately, I was unable to answer the call during class, but I called back as soon as class ended. She mentioned finding the phone in my room, despite me telling her that the owner had taken it. She also asked why the camera was taped, assuming it was broken.

With fear in my voice, I cautioned her to leave the phone where it was, stay away from it, and not remove the tape on the camera. I told her that I was coming home. Shortly afterward, I hung up and rushed home.

Upon arriving home, I found my mom relaxed, watching TV and eating popcorn. I took a deep breath, relieved, and asked her where the phone was. She told me that it was on the table, and I quickly picked it up. However, when I turned the phone over, I noticed that the tape was removed, sending a chill down my spine.

"Mom, did you remove the tape on the camera?" I asked.
"Yes," she replied.
My heart sank. "Oh my God," I exclaimed, "why did you do that?"
My panic escalated as I opened the gallery and saw my mom's selfie on the phone. I was filled with anger and tears. "Why did you take a selfie with this phone?" I asked, sobbing and fearful.
She was shocked and confused by my reaction. She had no idea what she had done. I ran to my room, locked the door, threw the phone on the bed, and started screaming with anger. I cried for a long time, wondering what to do next and how to stop this madness.
I opened the gallery again and saw the date of my mom's selfie. The date showed that she had only 120 days left to live. I was helpless and had no idea how to stop it. Breaking the phone might fix everything, but then all the victims of the phone would die immediately. I couldn't do that either.
I thought maybe turning off the power would have some effect, so I removed the battery, but that did not help. People in my town whose photos were taken by the phone still died unexpectedly.
My mom had only a few days left. I couldn't figure out what to do to save her. There had to be a way, but I didn't know where to start. Maybe the answer was hidden in the phone. I opened the phone again and began scrolling through the gallery from the beginning, hoping to find some clues about how it all started.


At the beginning of the gallery, I came across a photo of a man in the first row. Upon checking the date, I was surprised to find that it was taken two months ago and it had not turned black and foggy like the other dead photos.

I pondered on this all day and finally came to the conclusion that the phone wanted a soul for a soul. If I clicked more photos of people, maybe it would forgive my mom. This was the only way, albeit unsure, but I had to try. I would do anything to save my mom.

Days passed, and my mom's death date was fast approaching. I finally decided to click photos of random people outside, and after clicking hundreds of photos, I buried the phone to stop the curse from spreading.

Now, I am just waiting to see what happens next. I don't know if my plan will work and the devil will forgive my mother. But after many days passed, people in my town started dying in unexpected ways. I cannot forgive myself for this crime. The guilt and shame will stay with me forever, and the voices of the dead people whisper in my ears that I am a killer.
