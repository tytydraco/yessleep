Before I begin, I want to make it absolutely clear that this is not an admission of guilt. I am not responsible for what happened—or what’s going to happen. That being said, I *am* sorry. For reasons that will become clear later.

But for now, just understand: this is out of my control.

\* \* \*

The party plowed onward like a runaway bus in a 90’s-era Keanu Reeves movie. I stood by the only working PA, watching as people I knew only in passing danced and bustled around me.

I was not having a good time. The music was too loud, the people too leery and happy, like a kid right after his first sip of Coke. To make matters worse, the beer—usually my only savior in moments like these—tasted like battery acid that someone had marinated in cow piss then filtered through a three-day-old sock. You’re no doubt wondering why I was even there in the first place, given how totally unhappy to be there I was. The truth is I was there for one specific reason, said reason being that I have a terrible penchant for letting people talk me into things.

Back in high school there’d been this kid, Freddy Lutz. Freddy was a transfer from another school in a neighboring town, who had a very peculiar yet intriguing talent, wherein for a small fee he would do absolutely anything you dared him to. Nothing was off limits. Whether it be streaking during morning assembly or jumping off the gymnasium roof, he faced each task appointed to him with the utmost seriousness. For instance, this one time at Nick Priestly’s house, we’d dared him to drink the weird glow-in-the-dark shit out of one of those little disposable neon glow sticks—*you know, for the lolz?* Anyway, he’d drank it, and I guess it must have been toxic or whatever cause he ended up in the hospital soon after. Word around school was he’d ended up with permanent glow-in-the-dark pee as a result (though to be fair I have a feeling he might have started that rumor himself, because glow-in-the-dark pee sounds freaking awesome).

If you’re any kind of reasonable human being, you’re no doubt wondering why I’m telling you this. That’s fair. And while you might be sitting there right now thinking I’m just some dumb kid (correct) with too much time on his hands and nothing better to do (also correct), let it be known I in fact have a very good reason for bringing up good ol’ Freddy Lutz. 

You see, even on his best, most-Freddy day, Freddy was no match for Mac.

I found him by the keg a few minutes later, surrounded by a handful of other party-goers whom I likewise didn’t know, each of varying levels of intoxication. He was wearing his Michael Myer’s costume again, the one with the chilli sauce stains on it, even though Halloween was three weeks ago and he’d lost the mask—so just a boiler suit, basically. He held a red plastic cup in each hand, filled to almost overflowing with some dark fluid I hoped wasn’t blood (although, with Mac, you could just never tell). 

He saw me coming and his eyes lit up. “Ah—Nate! There you are. Get over here. Jenny’s about to light her farts.” 

Mac was my best friend, and the reason for my presence at the party that night. In that sense you could say that everything that happened was all Mac’s fault, that if he hadn’t talked me into accompanying him we could have avoided the whole thing and gone and gotten brewskies or whatever. But of course, that’s not how “it” works. There’s every chance we could have avoided the party entirely and things still would have worked out the same—but more on that later.

“*Beer?*” He held one of the red cups out to me.

“Nah, I’m good—think I’m gonna head.”

He shot me with a surprised-Pikachu face. “Now?! But you can’t!”

“Why not?”

“*Because…*” He gestured vaguely around us. “And besides, you can’t go. If you go now, you won’t have a chance to tell Kim about how you saved all those orphans that one time.”

“I never saved any orphans, Mac.”

“Right—but *she* doesn’t know that, does she? Come on. It’ll be fun. Also—” He went to say more, but then a girl dressed as a xenomorph strode confidently past, proboscis and all. He turned back to me. “Actually, Nate, you’re right. You should absolutely go. And besides, chicks hate orphans. Everyone knows that. See ya!”

“*Mac—*”

But he was already hurriedly making his way after her.

I shot another look around me and sighed. Then I got the hell out of there.

\* \* \*

That was what was so endearing about Mac. For most people, the revelation that you are not the most important thing in the universe is like a hammer-blow to the soul, the gateway to nihilism and crack and all those Nine Inch Nails albums. But Mac? Mac stared out at the universe and all of its meaninglessness and cracked open another beer. That’s just the way he was. It was a philosophy as good as any other, really. When fate rears its ugly head, you just laugh and go flick over to another channel.

Which is why, when I got the call later that night, and I heard the sheer panic in his voice, I was understandably confused.

“Nate! Oh, Nate, thank fuck!” It sounded like he’d been crying. “I thought you weren’t gonna answer!”

"*Mac?*” I rubbed sleep from my eyes and pushed myself onto my elbows. I checked my phone. *3:32am*. “What are you—?”

“She’s *dead*, Nate!”

His words cut through me like a hot knife through shit. The fog of sleep vanished instantly, as if just shot by a leaf blower, or God.

“What? Who’s—?”

“*The* *girl*, Nate! You know—*Alien* girl. She’s fucking dead!”

I don’t know if there’s a word for the moment you’re roused at three in the morning to learn that a woman you do not know is dead. 

I pushed myself up fully and rubbed at my eyes again. I couldn’t seem to process what he was saying. “Okay, now—look, just calm down a sec. Where are you right now?”

There was a brief pause from down the line. I could almost see him looking around. “I don’t know… it all looks the same. *Fuck, Nate! What do I do?*”

“Check your sat-nav. Get me an address. I’ll meet you in five.”

I met him a half-hour later, in the parking lot of a knock-off Waffle House, whose most defining feature seemed to be that it was no longer open for business. I’d have gotten there sooner, but in his panicked state Mac had sent me the wrong address three times, his shaking hands unable to text properly. 

I pulled up and he immediately jumped in, slamming the door behind him. 

“Fuck. I thought you were never gonna get here…” he said, slinking down into the seat. He looked awful, his face pale and ashy, his eyes red from crying. A film of clear snot covered his top lip. “I don’t fucking believe this is happening. *Like, is this even real?* What the actual fuck…”

I had gotten a little bit of what had gone down during our phone call earlier. Supposedly, he and the *Alien* girl—whose real name, turns out, was Ashley—had hit it off pretty good, and had gone back to her place so they could, and I quote, “keep the party going”. They were just starting to get into things when she’d suddenly sat bolt upright, eyes wide, pointing at something in the corner of the room, something Mac couldn’t see. Exactly what had happened next still wasn’t clear, but suffice it to say when it was over, Ashley the xenomorph was dead.

“And you’re sure you couldn’t have just, you know…” 

He whirled on me. “Just what—*imagined* it? You think I’m *high*?”

“*Are you?*”

“No. *Yes*—shit, what does it matter? I know what I saw.”

“We should call the cops.”

He shot me a look like I was the captain of the idiot Olympics. “Are you out of your freaking mind? They’ll say I killed her!”

“You don’t know that. And besides, this isn’t a joke, Mac. This is serious. Someone is dead. We have to tell someone.”

He fell quiet and sat back in his seat, suddenly deflated. It took me a moment to realize he was crying again. “You should have seen it, Nate… the way her head twisted on her neck like that. Like her head was trying to rip itself right off her shoulders. *Could a seizure do that, do you think?*”

I said nothing. I had no fucking idea.

A tense silence followed. We stared through the windshield, neither of us talking, Mac working his way through cigarette after cigarette as if he could smoke the events of that evening away, having to hold the lighter with both hands to stop it from shaking. At some point it must have started raining, the world beyond the Hyundai’s windshield now hidden behind a sheet of rippling water. 

After what felt like a very long time, I turned back to him. “Well, if we’re not calling the cops, we should probably think about what we’re going to do next. You remember if you left any incriminating evidence over there? Anything that might point the cops in your direction?”

Right here you’re probably wondering why I would so readily tag myself in as his accomplice, given the stakes. I get that. I could go into a long spiel about “the power of friendship”, how we had known each other since we were five, but the truth is we were homies, and either you’re the sort of person that gets what that means or you’re not. And if you’re not… honestly, I feel bad for you.

He began patting down his pockets. “I don’t think so. We’d only just—” He froze. “*Oh, fuck...*”

“What?”

“My *phone*, Nate.”

For a moment this confused me. “You have your phone, dumbass. Why the hell do you think I’m even here?”

“No, not *that* one. The other one. My fucking… work phone, or whatever.”

The phone he was referring to was the one he used to text his ‘customers’ whenever a new shipment came in—by which I mean he used it to sell weed. It was his weed phone. Or occasionally stronger stuff, if he could get his hands on it. Downers, mostly. Nothing crazy.

If I’m making him sound like some kind of criminal mastermind right now, he’s not. Less *Breaking Bad...* more *Pineapple Express*, only if every character died in the first ten minutes.

“Oh, fuck…” I said.

“What am I gonna do? They’re gonna know I was there.”

“We have to go get it.”

“Piss on that! I’m not going back in there!”

“We don’t have a choice. It’s that or jail. So, what’s it gonna be?”

We stared at each other across the car, a single word visible in each other’s eyes.

*Fuck.*

\* \* \*

Ashley’s apartment was on the second floor of a beige, low-rent apartment complex across town, one that looked like the only thing still holding it together was the sheer will of its tenants. 

We parked around back and took the stairs one at a time, the two of us feeling like criminals as we crept up each weathered step, trying to look as inconspicuous as possible, even though it was still the middle of the night. 

At the top of the stairs, we paused. 

The door to Ashley’s apartment was standing open, just as Mac had left it. 

We stared at it.

“This is a bad idea,” Mac said. 

“Shit, you got a better one, I’m all ears. Now come on.”

Ashley’s apartment was a lot bigger on the inside than it had looked from the stairs. Essentially just one large room—what might have passed for a pretty cool loft, if not for the mess, and the clutter, and the evident lack of any real attempt to make it so. A faint charred smell hung in the air; the ghost of an overcooked lasagna, perhaps, along with another smell, one I had come to think of as “girl.”

Lying strewn in the middle of the floor was Ashley.

“Oh, fuck,” I said.

Her xenomorph costume was nowhere in sight, the only thing adorning her cooling flesh now being that of a pair of off-white colored panties, and what I assumed to be a previous boyfriend’s oversized tee. I stared down at her glassy eyes, partially hidden behind a mop of thick copper hair. There was something off about her neck, I noticed, like it had been stretched beyond its natural limit, and could now never revert to the state it had been before, just like how it is with slinkies.

I had never seen a dead body before—not a real one, anyway. I’d always assumed that in the event I ever did, it’d be this big, profound moment, like how it is in the movies. But really, all I felt was sad. Because once you peel back the curtain, turns out dead is just dead.

Mac and I continued to stare at her, our hearts pounding so loud I was genuinely concerned we’d wake the neighbors.

Finally, I said, “Okay. Now let’s speedrun this shit and get the hell out of here.”

And so our hunt for the elusive weed phone began.

We pawed between couch cushions, looked under shelves, the two of us trying and failing not to look at the body of the dead girl currently stiffening on the rug three feet away from us. Our shoes left wet tracks on the faux-wood floor as we walked, causing me to wonder if that was the sort of thing you could get DNA from, if I even wanted to know. At some point it occurred to us it would be simpler to just call the phone, but of course that only worked if the phone you were trying to call had battery, which Mac’s did not, because of course it didn’t. 

Just off the main space was a door. 

Figuring it couldn’t hurt, I tiptoed over and pushed down the handle, finding myself suddenly in a bathroom about the exact size and shape of your typical prison cell. Just a toilet and one of those walk-in showers, really, the stall door fogged with what looked to be years of untended mildew growth. One glance around was enough to determine that, unless Mac had stashed it in the toilet tank (which, knowing Mac, wasn’t totally off the cards), the weed phone wasn’t in here. 

Satisfied, I turned to leave, but as I was making my way out the door something to my left caught my eye. 

I stepped over to the medicine cabinet, frowning.

Somebody had taped over the mirror—and gone to great lengths, apparently. Just ribbons and ribbons of thick red electrical tape, stretched so as to cover the mirror’s entire surface. 

I stared at this, momentarily dumbfounded, and not sure exactly why. It was just a mirror. No big deal. *So then why did looking at it make me feel so... weird?*

I was still contemplating this when I heard a startled cry from back out in the other room.

Suddenly panicked, I darted back out through the door to find Mac now bent over with his hands on his knees, breathing hard.

“What?!” I said. “What is it?!” I wondered if we were under attack. Jesus, that’d be all we needed.

Instead of answering, he lifted his hand and pointed.

I shifted my gaze to where he was pointing, to a desk sat propped against the apartment’s far wall. On the desk was a laptop—a MacBook. A dull blue light emanated from its screen.

It hadn’t been like that a moment ago.

“Motherfucker almost gave me a heart attack...”

“Did you do that?” I said.

“No, that’s what I’m saying. I was just standing here, and the thing clicked on all by itself. Damn near gave me a prolapse.”

“You sure you didn’t jog it, or something?”

“*From all the way over here?!*”

I stepped across the room and leaned down. 

Staring back at me from the screen was some chat site I’d never heard of. The interface was barebones—just a grey chat window with white text and a black sidebar listing a handful of users, most of whom had names that looked like throwaway accounts. They seemed to be talking about some kind of game. One I’d never heard of.

*The hell is this shit?*

“*The Raggedy Man?*” said Mac, leaning over my shoulder. I hadn’t even heard him move. “The fuck’s that?”

“Don’t know.”

“What do you think it means?”

I didn’t know. And I didn’t want to know. All of a sudden, the laptop was giving me bad vibes, like it had bad ju-ju, or whatever. Like with the mirror, there was no real reason for that to be the case. But there it was, all the same.

“Oh, hey, look!” said Mac suddenly from behind me, startling me for what felt like the millionth time. “There it is!”

I looked down to where he was pointing, and sure enough, there was his weed phone, lying half-hidden beneath a pile of unopened mail, and what looked suspiciously like a novelty bong shaped like a wizard’s dick.

*Well—at least that’s one mystery solved.*

Before leaving, I shot one last look back at Ashley and her slinky-neck. I wondered briefly if I should say something, like her freaking… *last rites* or whatever, then figured if there was anything left to be said, it certainly wasn’t by me. And she sure-as-shit wasn’t going to hear it.

And so, like the dumbasses we were, we fled. 

I guess that was how it started, or whatever.

\* \* \*

The next few days passed in a blur of denial, coffee, and fitful, nightmare-laden sleep.

I returned to work—as a sales assistant over at Regals, selling overpriced vinyls to stoned trust-fund kids cosplaying as middle-class Americans to justify their need for angsty, rage-fuelled metal music.

For the most part, I kept myself busy—helping customers, handling returns—and when Marcus suggested a surprise midweek stock-check, I promptly volunteered, grateful for any excuse to stay moving and keep my brain on anything other than dead girls with too-long necks. 

But even as I tried, thoughts of Ashley were never far from my mind. 

*Had we done the right thing, leaving her like that?* 

I told myself there was nothing else we could have done—after all, *we* hadn’t killed her. The seizure had—even if, granted, we had no idea exactly how. We weren’t doctors, let alone coroners. Was it possible to seize so hard you broke your own neck? Wasn’t that supposed to be, like, really hard to do? And what was that shit with the mirror?

I was still contemplating this when the man in the beige tracksuit wandered in.

He was a tall guy. Skinny—but not in an eating-disorder kind of way. More *lithe*, like the guy ran track, or did meth, maybe. The kind of guy you’d expect to find at the gym doing bodyweight exercises while pounding down a smoothie. His hair was bleached a hateful blond, and his skin—the parts I could see—was slick and shiny with wet, like the guy had just crawled out of a river, or a Hugo Boss commercial. I noticed he was very pale.

“Help you?” I said.

He wandered over to the counter behind which I stood. I became acutely aware I was the only person on the floor. Goddamn Marcus.

We stared at each other.

I said, “Uh… Welcome to Regals. Was there something I could help you with?”

*A towel, maybe…*

Instead of answering, he very slowly pulled his hands out of his pockets and laid them on the counter.

There was something wrong with his fingers, I saw at once; all wrinkly and pruned, like how they get when you stay in the bath for too long. Deep cuts covered them in unsightly gashes, each one a bloodless, gaping smile—what you’d be forgiven for thinking were defensive wounds.

I gasped and took an unconscious step back. “Oh—shit! Hey, are you—?”

The man opened his mouth, and I watched in dumb horror as a river of brackish, black water dumped out onto the counter, spattering off the glass; an inhuman amount, an amount that was surely impossible.

I opened my mouth to scream—

*“Nate?”*

I blinked, and suddenly the man in the beige tracksuit was gone.

I spun my head around, confused and in a panic, and it was only then that I spotted Marcus standing behind me.

“What’s wrong? Christ, you look awful. Are you sick?” His eyes were very wide.

“No, I’m—*was there a guy here just now*?”

“A guy?” He looked around the empty store, bewildered.

“Yeah. Tall guy. In a tracksuit?”

“It’s just you and me, my man.” He eyed me over. “Yo, you good?”

I opened my mouth to answer, then let it fall shut again. 

I had no fucking idea.

\* \* \*

The rest of that afternoon passed mostly without incident. To his credit, Marcus offered to let me have the rest of the afternoon off, but I declined, assuring him that I was fine, even though I clearly wasn’t. Of course, the fact that I really needed the paycheck definitely played a part, and while I didn’t think Marcus would use my going home early as an excuse to dock my pay, I wasn’t exactly sure he wouldn’t, either.

During my break, I had a sudden brainwave and snuck into Marcus’ office where we keep the feed for the security cameras, already knowing what I’d find, but needing to check anyway.

There had been no man in a tracksuit, turns out, just as I’d known there wouldn’t be—beige or otherwise.

Which meant only one of two things; either I had hallucinated the whole ordeal, or there really had been somebody there, one who could not only teleport, but also seemingly knew how to manipulate surveillance footage. Of course, I knew the idea I had just suffered some kind of miniature stroke, or seismic brain-fart, wasn’t entirely off the cards, either; an echo of a bad trip, perhaps, taken long ago. *And hell, didn’t they say that stuff stayed in your system?*

*Or maybe the whole thing with Ashley has rattled you more than you’d like to admit?* my Judas of a brain offered. *Maybe you’re rattled and now this is you finally losing it?* 

Hmm—touché, brain. Touché…

I decided to swing by Mac’s on the way back from work. He’d been conspicuously quiet since the whole thing back over at Ashley’s—which wasn’t surprising, considering. I told myself it was to check on him, but really what I was seeking was comfort; some semblance of normalcy after the batshit-crazy thing I’d just witnessed—even if only to reassure myself that I wasn’t losing it, after all. And besides, I figured he owed me.

Mac’s place was a forgettable two-storey brick apartment complex across town, tucked between a vape shop and a shuttered laundromat. The hallway stank of burnt oil and cat piss, and one of the overhead strip lights always flickered intermittently, strobing just enough to make you feel like you were walking straight into an Eli Roth movie. Dick-themed graffiti lined the walls—and in some places, even the ceiling—the oversized (and oddly veiny) members looming down on us in all their menacing, phallic glory.

I stopped in front of Mac’s door and raised my hand to knock—

I paused.

The front door was standing open.

I got a brief flashback to Ashley the xenomorph’s place from the other night.

“Mac?” I called, gently pushing my head through the door. 

The inside of his apartment was dim—only a few scattered candles provided any light, their flickering glow casting warped shadows across the walls. The living room—never the cleanest of spaces—now looked like a ritual site for some kind of dollar-store exorcism. Burnt-out tealights littered every available surface. Empty beer cans and bottles of what I thought were some kind of exotic European vodka lay strewn all over the coffee table, tipped over like casualties after an intense battle. Casting my gaze downward I saw salt (or what I *hoped* was salt) had been poured in jagged rings around the couch, the windows, even the goddamn TV. Every reflective surface I could see—mirrors, black screen, even a chrome toaster—had been taped over with receipts, newspaper, or just turned to face the wall.

“Mac?” I tried again, louder this time. I pushed my way into his apartment, hearing empty cans clatter as I pushed them aside. Immediately I was hit with a smell; a smell like old food and sweat and burnt candles, all mixed together in a heady cocktail of stale farts and alcoholism. 

I proceeded further into the apartment, kicking my way through old takeout boxes and strewn clothing items, wondering as I did so what exactly could have happened that had seen Mac’s apartment turned into the morning after at a frat party (of course, knowing Mac there was every chance it had always looked this way, and I was only just now noticing).

I stepped into the bathroom—

“Mac?”

He was standing in the tub, fully clothed, hands wrapped tightly around his signed Barry Bonds baseball bat, the one with the words HOME INVASION NEGOTIATOR written on it in thick sharpie, holding it out in front of him like a priest warding off a vampire. His eyes were bloodshot and too-wide, and there was an almost feral look about him, like how a man might look upon finding himself backed into a corner by a mob of giant, sex-starved orangutans.

He screamed as I entered and raised the bat high.

I held up my hands. “Whoa! Whoa! Chill! It’s me!”

He let out a long breath and lowered it. “Jesus, Nate! I almost brained you!” His voice was hoarse, like he hadn’t used it properly in days. I realized I could smell him, too; the smell of male sweat and booze, underpinned by the bitter stink of cheap, dollar store candles. “How did you even get in here?”

“What do you mean how did I get in here? Your front door was open.” I considered, then added, “*Why are you in the bath?*”

“Get the fuck in here!”

He grabbed me by the shoulder and yanked me inside, kicking the door shut with his foot before promptly collapsing against the wall. “Oh, man—that was too close…”

He looked awful. There were deep bags under his eyes, so dark it looked like he had stepped into a teleporter with a raccoon, and something had gone terribly wrong. A nearly spent roll of toilet paper sat on the floor next to the tub, like it had been drafted in for emotional support. He’d lost weight, too, I noted, his FUNK DA POLEECE hoodie now hanging off him in unnatural ways. He looked like the poster child for an anti-meth campaign, one that would by all appearances be very effective.

“What the hell is going on with you?” I said, staring down at him. “You don’t answer my calls for days. Now I come over and you’re springing out of the bathtub like some fucked up game of jack-in-the-box? *What gives?* *Do I need to call an intervention?*”

“You don’t understand...”

“So *tell* me. What the fuck is up with you?”

He looked up at me then, and I saw there were tears in his eyes. He shook his head. “We should have never gone there.”

“*Where?*” I said, even though, really, I already knew. “You mean Ashley’s.”

He gave a barely perceptible nod. All of a sudden, it was like I was looking at a child; a small, terrified child, one who was clearly exhausted.

*What the fuck, Mac?*

I listened as he explained a little about what had been going on. 

It had started as noises around his apartment, apparently. A thud here, a scratch there. Little things, things you could almost chalk up to your imagination. But then the voices had begun. They were never clear; little more than snatches of whispered conversation, always just behind him, causing him to frequently spin around, convinced he’d find someone standing there—but of course, there never was.

Then, after the voices, came the visions.

“I had to leave,” he said, pulling his knees up to his chest as he recounted, reminding me again of a child. “Just get away. I tried to go to Audrey’s, but she kicked me out, said I could come back when I stopped “being weird”—whatever that means. Can you believe that shit?” He took a swig from the bottle of JD placed conveniently beside him. “So anyway, I’m walking back, and that’s when I first see them.”

“Them?”

“I don’t know who they are. Just fucking *people*, man, you know? Just staring at me. Shit, you ever had days like that? Like wherever you go, people are just staring at you, like there’s something on your face, or whatever? It was like that, only worse. *Way* worse. I swear I could actually *feel* their gazes on my back. I would have chalked it up to my imagination, if it weren’t for the other thing.”

“Other thing?” I said, not really wanting to know, but knowing I had no choice. “What other thing? You’re not making any sense.”

What he said next sent a jolt of ice through my balls.

“I… think they were dead.”

I went very still. 

“The fuck do you mean, ‘dead’?”

“I mean *dead*, man, what do you think I mean? The way they *looked*, the way they *moved*—it was like they’d been, I don’t know, broken, or something—but there’s more.” He met my gaze again, and I saw he was openly sobbing. “I think… I think Ashley was with them.”

I stared down at him for a long moment, barely breathing. I didn’t know what to say. I thought briefly of my beige tracksuit man, how he’d appeared back at Regals—like a corpse dragged from a riverbed—and promptly pushed the thought away.

“Listen,” I said, squatting down beside him. “You’ve been through a lot recently, okay? The whole thing with Ashley… it was *awful*. But you have to understand, the things you’re seeing… none of it is *real*, okay? It’s all in your head. It’s just stress—that’s all.”

“I went to her apartment.”

His words hit me like a pie to the face. 

“Please tell me you’re joking...”

Instead of answering, he reached over into the tub, and like a shitty magician pulled out a slim black laptop—one I recognized immediately to be the same one from Ashley’s apartment.

I gawped at him. “You stupid motherfucker. Are you out of your goddamn mind? What if somebody had seen you?”

He held the laptop out to me, handling it like how one might handle an ancient artefact. “The stuff on her computer, Nate… it’s all true. All of it. I mean, I wasn’t sure at first, not really, but now I know for certain. Once you’ve seen it, learned about it—hell, even *heard its name*, that’s it. Game over, man, game over.”

“That why you taped over all the mirrors?” I said, not trying to be a smart-ass, but unable to help myself. In my defense, it was late, I was tired, and all this hocus-pocus bullshit was seriously starting to piss me off. I mean what were we even talking about here, ghosts? What were we, ten?

I was expecting him to come back at me at that, but instead he just lowered his head. I saw his shoulders bobbing, realized he’d resumed crying.

“Will you stay?” he said. “Just for tonight? Please? I don’t want to be alone.”

I stared down at his big stupid face, wanting to tell him no, fuck that, that I was done with ghost stories for the evening—but of course, I didn’t. Whether I liked it or not, Mac was my friend. I couldn’t just leave him, and I knew—fucked up or not—he’d never let me talk him into taking him to the hospital.

So I didn’t leave. 

And of course, it was a mistake.

\* \* \*

It took a lot longer for Mac to fall asleep than I’d originally anticipated. Having flatly refused to leave the tub, I’d instead gone and gotten his blanket and pillow from his bedroom, figuring if he absolutely had to spend the night in there, he could at least do it in relative comfort. I’d thought he’d be out like a light the second his head hit the pillow—what given how exhausted he’d looked—but to my surprise (and eternal annoyance) he apparently hadn’t finished talking yet. 

“She was still there, you know,” he'd said, pulling me from a daze. From my position sitting propped against the far wall, I could just see his head peeking out above the rim of the tub. “Ashley, I mean. Isn’t that crazy—that someone can die like that and the world just keeps moving on, completely oblivious? She didn’t even look that bad. Hell, she could have been sleeping.”

To keep Mac from spiralling any further, I’d also gone ahead and confiscated Ashley’s laptop, telling myself I wasn’t going to go through it, that there was no way, but of course within half an hour I was balls-deep in their chat history. Turns out Mac had been using Ashley’s account to talk to whoever was on the other end, asking for advice, his requests growing more desperate and frenzied over time. The few responses he got back were mostly about Ashley, and where she now was, if she was okay. This last gave me pause. The only times I’d ever seen her was as a vaguely-human shape walking away from me, and a corpse. It was easy to forget she had once been a person, with a life, and friends, people who cared about her, and would likely miss her. If there had been any talk about the things Mac—a*nd I*—had witnessed, it was all gone, the chat history—at least in this regard—now all but wiped clean. I had no idea why this would be the case, but seeing it irked me. 

Not knowing what else to do, I began methodically sifting through her search history, feeling strangely like a peeping tom as I scanned each site, mentally making a note of anything that jumped out as unusual. There was the typical stuff, for the most part. Social media sites, YouTube, a little light porn (*girls watch porn now, too?!*).

I must have nodded off at some point, because the next thing I remember was waking up in the dark.

I blinked and tried to look around me, but I couldn’t see anything. Evidently at some point while I slept the candles had gone out, turning my immediate environment into a black void. 

I was just thinking about laying my head back down when—

*“Nate!”* 

I shot up onto my elbows, knocking Ashley’s laptop onto the floor, having fallen asleep with it propped on my chest. “Mac?”

I got up and shambled into the bathroom, finding Mac once again clutching his Barry Bonds bat. His eyes were wide and panicked, and there was spittle in each corner of his mouth. A thick sheen of sweat covered his entire body, glinting in the light from the candle. He looked rabid with terror.

“What—?”

“DO YOU SEE?!” He gestured past me at the open doorway. 

I turned and followed his gaze, staring now into a blackness as thick and dark as any I’d ever seen. It was more than darkness. It was the absence of light, a darkness so full and heavy that even the light from the candle couldn’t penetrate.

I said, “There’s nothing there, Mac. You’re just having a bad dream.”

“He’s here…”

I began to tell him to go back to sleep, that I was done with this babysitting shit, when suddenly I heard something from back out in the hallway behind me, and I turned, the hairs on the back of my neck suddenly standing upright.

I peered into the inky dark, my breath held, and for the faintest of moments thought I could just make out the outline of something standing there in the dark.

Something big.

I had time to think *what the fuck*—

That was when Mac started screaming.
