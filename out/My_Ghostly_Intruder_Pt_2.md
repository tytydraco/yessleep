I am moving into a new place, except the place seemed to have come with a surprise guest. 

"Wow, dude how many jars do you have, I mean seriously this is insane amounts of jars." 

Though he was asking a question it felt more insulting than questioning. My rebuttal of course was very well centered. "Shut up." 

Of course he didn't do as asked of him. "Please, put that down." 

I say looking at the teen holiding my jar and looking it over like a foreign object. 

Great! He's going to break it. 

"No, I mean seriously who even carries this much jars, every corner and shelf, even the fridge both the freezer and deep freezer." He looked around at the objects like I was the madman.

"I even saw jars in the bathroom." 

I looked back over to him annoyed, little did he know there's more where that came from. 

"Just drop it, ok?" I say feeling cornered. 

"Ok" he says looking at me, smiling wickedly and then proceeds to drop my jar onto the hardwood ground. I hear the crash before my brain registers what made the sound. 

I look down at the now pile of glass on the ground in horror. "Oops" he says starting to laugh. 

"You must be a demon, not a ghost." I say, with anger etched into me. 

He stops his annoying laughter at the statement. 

"Oh, trust me I'm no demon you'd better be happy about the fact. They are no friend of anyone's." 

I wrinkled an eyebrow. He smiles mischievously, what was so funny. 

"I'm more of a poltergeist, if you will." He says, sounding happy at the idea. 

"What's that?" Hopefully I didn't sound like an idiot. Judging from his smile I'd say I probably did. 

"It's what I am, a giant amount of amalgamated energy, that's of a prior living being, I can touch, make noises, and break as much as I'd like." He says all cheery like it was fun to be dead. 

I let my chin drop forming a frown. "you can disturb the physical world? Yeah I already knew that from when you threw that complimentary soap at my head when I first met you. "

He laughed at the memory. I rolled my eyes. 

I didn't have time for this I had to continue moving all of my stuff into jars and then moving those jars into their rightful places, in the house. 

I walked over to my soaps, and bath bombs. 

Before I could of course continue I heard a ring at my door followed by some loud, knocks. 

Well I guess she was already here, I thought she'd take a bit more time. 

I walked over and opened the door to see the same built for business woman I had seen before that had robbed me. She handed over the jars she had stolen. 

I took them carefully placing them back on my shelf behind us. Then I turned back to her and disapprovingly clasped my arms together. 

"Well?" I said. 

She frowned "I'm sorry for robbing you last time." She said, I nodded. She turned behind her and waved at her probation officer. He smiled back and gave me a thumbs up before driving off. 

"Come in." 

She walked in seeming annoyed, just like I knew I was sure to be. 

"Amber" I said looking down at the note she had given me. 

"You are my community service, I have to help you, clean and move in, for a 6 week period." She said annoyed. 

I smiled at her, "nice to officially meet you Amber." She didn't look very happy to meet me. 

"I'm Kai" I say, she shakes my hand. 

"Sounds like a girl's name." 

"Oh" I frown at the insult. Well that was rude and it hurt my feelings. 

"Ok" I watch as she walks in taking off her bag and tossing it on my floor nodding at the teen for acknowledgement. 

"HA! KAI!" said the annoying teen laughing at my name too. 

I sigh, great now I had two insulting people in my home. 

"You wouldn't mind if I asked a few of my friends to stop by to help move this party along would you?" 

Said Amber, "Yes, I would mind." I'm exasperated. How can someone be so unruly. 

I walked back over to my soaps and continued placing them into jars separated by color. I must've gotten lost in time doing so because, though I ignored the constant bickering and laughter from the other two behind me. 

The doorbell rang soon again, followed by heavy knocking. 

I looked back over to Amber who was snickering at something the teen had said. "Who's that?" I say frantic. 

"A few friends to make this a real party." 

I shook my head franticly again, "I thought I told you not to invite anyone." I say shocked at this woman's inability to hear. 

"Oh, I heard you, I just don't care." 

WHAT!

She walked over to 'MY' door and opened it. "Hey! Billy, Lena, Casey." 

The three walked in two girls and one boy. I was even more exasperated. "What am I? A babysitter?" I mumble. Though I was pretty sure this woman and her friends were around the same age as me, I could care less. 

I didn't want them here, the whole reason I had moved into this place was because I had wanted to be alone. Now, not only did I live with a scary ghost teen, I lived with a daily visiting built assassin woman. 

What had my life came to. 

A few days ago I didn't even believe ghosts existed. 

Wait.. 

I just realized something. 

Amber didn't know the kid was a ghost, she probably still thought he was my son. 

I smirk villainous like. 

"What's wrong with him?" Said a woman with long black hair. 

"I have no idea." Said Amber. Then I realized everyone was staring at me like I was crazy. Then I also realized I was smiling like I was crazy. I slowly dropped my villainous smirk, like it was a loaded weapon.

Stay away from the crazy, stay away from the crazy. I say gently to myself.

"You ok there?" Said the guy seeming confused by something.

He was still staring "Yes, I'm sorry, guys." 

They all nodded at me, even the little tyke of a teen in the back.

"Uhm, let's get into the heavy lifting, how about one of you guys sort my soaps to match each other in those jars." I pointed to my discontinued work.

"Any takers?" I ask, and the girl with the long black hair raises her hand.

"YOU!" I say probably too enthusiastic. 

Hopefully I can actually be moved in here by next week with the help of this group.

"Ok, well I also need someone to sort and squirt all of my tubes of lotion into those jars over there."

I say pointing to a wider set of jars in the corner. Now the group all looked kind of confused. Staring at each other than back to me.

 The teen starts to laugh in the background.

"I guess I could do that?" Said Amber.

I shook my head.

"Ok, then how about the dirts?" 
I point to the back of the house. I heard one of them mutter a quiet "huh" I smile back at them, but they just continued to look painfully confused.

"What does that even mean?" Said the guy. "Billy, play nice." I heard one of the girl whisper back at him.

So this Billy guy didn't understand the Jar system, huh. "I want to load that dirt for plants up, into Jars." 

"HUH" I heard someone else say sounding distressed. "Jars" said someone else. "Why are you putting dirt into jars?" Said Billy. 

"So I can tag the name to it properly and seal it off from any possible infiltration." I say like it was obvious. I mean it should be it's obvious to me.

"Oh" said the longer haired girl.

"I'll do that," Billy stated. I nodded, then pointed at some more jars next to my bedroom.

"Anyone feel like going through every needle, thread, pin, pencil, eraser, sharpener, charcoal, marker, and watercolor set for me?" The last girl raised her hand, she looked confused but like she was going to do it anyways.

I nodded again smiling, "Don't forget to tag the names of each thing in the jars, write as neat as possible. Over there is my tag paper and markers." I pointed as they all nodded. 

"Right" I said as they all stared at me.

"Chop, chop get to work."

They all nodded then simultaneously, went to their area's getting started on their tasks. I walked over to the teen. 

"Wow,  surprised they didn't just walk out and leave immediately after you told them to literally go through needles to find things." 

He laughed as I rolled my eyes.

Ghost kids are a scary bit, but once Amber got to talking to him, she'd look like the crazy one not me.
