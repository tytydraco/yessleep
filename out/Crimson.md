*Am I even human anymore?* I look down at my horridly bunched and mangled flesh within the thick coating of heavily warped skin. I tried to flex what used to be a hand, looking down at what was now nothing more than a mangled claw, a fleshy club with mold growing from the deep crevices that all the scars had left on me. My flesh shifts as I sit forward, nearly knocking me back onto the crimson grass. *Crimson…* My eye grew tired as I took in the new sight of my torment. *It’s never more.* I sighed looking around, I was in the midst of a field. Alone and cold. There were almost no signs of life but the occasional  tree sprinkled into the cold crimson abyss. *At least the trees were pretty this time, a lot better than the weird bunched roots of the last place. The trees were a deep maroon and looked… almost breathing. It was almost uneasy.* The sight of these breathing behemoths reminded me of a simpler time. Even if everything was fuzzy I can still remember the friendly faces I used to know. 

I tried to think of more, like who these people were in my head or what they actually looked like, but that was all lost to time. My memory isn't what it used to be. Nonetheless, I couldn't dwell on that now. With any luck there’ll be new people here, and maybe an escape for us. But for now I’ll just try to appreciate  what was in front of me. The landscape blended reds and blacks as if I were in deep space. It was almost hypnotic. The flowers were sharp and hostile, their black vines covered in hook-like thorns that dug into my flesh as I picked them. Their heads were so pretty, a red stringy crater was dug into the middle surrounding its black stigma that had been speckled with a deep red pollen. My Three molded fingers bled as I picked the beauties, hooking them onto my loose skin like you would a proper suit. A small smile crept across my rug of a face. I couldn't help but wander and pick them. The air was a nice chill. Not freezing but not warm either.

These small flowers reminded me of a simpler time, the only remnants I held onto from my previous life outside this *body*. It all was too fuzzy, too grainy to remember anything but green, green and flowers, just like these but white. My distant memories were quickly interrupted by a bundle of spiked ants. They swarmed my twisted foot as I seemed to have crushed their den. I slowly began to swat at the peach sized bugs as I lifted my foot off their nest, some escaping back into their nest while others stayed to spit up on it, rebuilding it from the ground up.

My eyes drifted down to the shiny, reflective void the ants spit up to help rebuild their partially crushed den. My eye caught a glimpse of my warped body in the shattered void. One human eye hung in a deep scar in a rug of tissue that hung off my vaguely human head. My limbs looked unnaturally large and knotted. The weight of my matted flesh slowly crushed my posture down to something more ape-like than human. Seeing this disgusting display of my mangled form wiped any trace of enjoyment off my face. I let out another crushing sigh, whipping the black goo till its image was too distorted to make out.

I caught myself wandering the sharp grassy plains with the oddly cold and unforgiving sun hanging above me. I’m not sure how I keep losing myself but it feels like I move with an absent mind. Maybe I’m just wandering, I still couldn't find another soul out here though. The gentle breeze is slowly turning into a bone chilling gust. If anyone else is out there I'd give them a week before they all succumbed to the freezing temperature alongside myself. As I absentmindedly wandered I was starting to notice there was nothing out here. Not even a bug in sight. I was truly alone aside from the monoliths in the distance. They reminded me of that tree line I saw earlier. And with nothing better to do but wait to freeze I dragged myself towards them. Something about those grotesque trees shone a strangle ray of hope in this desolate hellscape. After what felt like days trudging through the sharp blade like grass I had finally made it to the tree line. The trees were a deep maroon with a black substance pumping through them as they breathed, almost like veins pumping blood through a person. 

As I entered the living tree line I was hit with a wave of welcoming warmth. My eye was quickly drawn to my squirming flesh. The bugs under my skin came alive in an instant, wiggling and running all along my flesh and dead nerves, the worms weaved in and out of my bare flesh as they fed on my bloat as the other bugs would dig away further into me laying their eggs in my shredded nerve endings. Typically, the bugs were anywhere from the size of a coin to a peach pit. The bugs were more good than bad though, the worms ate any tumors that would riddle my body while the others made sure I didn't outgrow myself any more than I had. A sudden burning in my throat snapped me out of the trance-like state watching the bugs left me in. I started hacking heavily, choking up a deep red sludge as my warped flesh crushed my lungs. As I finished spitting up the remainder of the sludge my ears were peaked by a Scrawny man curled up in front of me.

 He muttered to himself. “Well I guess it’s about time I gave up.” he chuckled, as I leaned forward on my hands, trying to support myself. He was a middle-aged man, a small scruffy shadow of a former beard lingered on his smirking face, his face hung ever so long with deep bags the size of his aged eyes and a crooked nose. His hair was a peppered mess, a dark gray with soft quiet spots running through it. Nonetheless, I tried to greet him properly. Hoping he’d see past my outer appearance and realize I’m a person just like him. I extended my hand out towards him, my three fingered palm open and expectant even if I was still bleeding. I had difficulty speaking, it had been so long since I've had an actual conversation  but I fear my body won't allow such things anymore. All my tumors and bugs, eating away at my vocal cords and digging holes into my lungs. Speaking was a hurdle I often had a hard time crossing. But I choked out a single word "Craig." 

He stared at my mangled hand then back up at me, his face falling flat. He looked back down to my hand inspecting it further, this time looking at my clumped and bunched fingers. With a subtle sigh he regained his composure as he grabbed my hand, shaking it. 

The man introduces himself. "Professor Zone. Are you new to this area or are you native here?” He waited patiently for me to choke up enough syllables to make a word into a sentence.

“I’m like you, but I’ve been in these places far too long.” Professor Zone sat there for a long time as I choked up every individual word, hacking up more and more sludge between each word. It took him a moment to put together my word salad.

“So you’re a person who's been stuck here?” I nodded towards Professor Zone as he said this. “So how long has it been?” my eye slugged down to the ground as I tried to picture anything outside this hell hole. Reds, purples, and yellow but nothing outside this place beside the fuzzy green but that feels far too distant. I choked 

“Don’t remember” Professor Zone’s face fell flat alongside mine. Professor Zone’s eyes traced the ground as he spoke.

“Oh so it's been that long. Well at least if there’s us two there’s bound to be someone else out here, whether they’re like you or me.” My eye slowly dragged up toward him, his face hopeful with a coy smile. He didn’t know. He didn't know a thing about this place or the people dragged here. *There was just something about Professor Zone. He was old but still lifeful, and oddly naive. Always trying to see the good in the worst. Maybe he just thinks everyone's a person at heart once you strip away their sinful acts. Or maybe… he was the monster, that's why he put on this act of density.* My eye fell upon Professor Zone again. *His face was long and elderly, but uncanny. He was human, sure but his smile never looked natural. Something about that man isn't right.* Professor Zone’s eyes met mine, his pupils shaky and fearful. He quickly tried to hide his emotions with a poorly placed smile. His voice cracked as he spoke.

“Well Craig, we probably should get back on the move and try to find something worthwhile. I mean what more is there to do here, I’m starving and the everlasting eclipse is slowly sinking out of sight and I’d never sleep here, too many bugs.” 

I responded to his cry with a slight sigh and stood back up. *It’s never more.* I slugged along with him, step after step, the ground growing more content the further we moved into the forest of monoliths. The ground was growing oddly soft but it didn’t take too long until exhaustion slowly overtook me. Looking around we hadn’t moved too far because everything still looked the same, I’m sure we could get lost in the vastness of the forest alone, let alone all the dead land that sat beyond it. 

“I think this’ll do Craig. Sure the bugs are still everywhere but I’m not sure we could escape them to begin with in this pit.”  

*I didn’t mind the bugs, they didn't taste too good but they’re all I’ve been eating since I woke in the red lands. They’re easy to crunch on with my few remaining teeth and typically they don't put up much of a fight unless they’ve got needily legs. I’ve learned to leave those ones be.* I looked over to Professor Zone, he was poorly jumping, trying to graze a fleshy fruit that sat just out of reach for him. I couldn't help a chuckle but that seemed to get his attention. His face was ever long and desperate, almost like a child who couldn't help himself. Feeling just a pin of pity for Professor Zone I looked at the fruit he had been trying to pick. It was a fleshy sack, roughly the size of a fist, with this black ooze pumping through it as it pulsed just like the monolith it was strung too. I stepped in front of Professor Zone pushing him out of my way as I reached for the fruit, as my hand wrapped around it, it responded, slowly shrinking into itself as my grip tightened. It was oddly warm and squishy but sticky. Almost like a newborn calf. I slowly started to pull harder and harder the poor thing desperately clinging onto the monolith till it finally gave, snapping off and flooding my hand with black ooze that seemed to poke and prod at my hand, leaving a strange tingling sensation all throughout my grabbing hand. I handed it down to Zone watching as he peeled the thing leaving the fleshy sack part of it on the crimson rug beneath us. Then for another long while I watched him play around with the hard pit trying his best to work with it to smash it on something until he finally got worked up enough to throw it aside, frustrated tears welling in the corners of his eyes. 

“I just don’t understand! What am I supposed to do with a stupid pit? Damn things harder than a rock. The bugs make it look so easy to eat.” Zone slowly broke down, his face pooling a bright red as his voice cracked. He shouted and screamed for a moment before regaining his composure. With tear filled eyes he spoke, his voice growing bitter and venomous. “God forbid I have an easy time. But no, that wouldn't be my life. It’s all just a long tunnel of false hopes and misfortune. When is it ever going to be my turn to win?” 

Seeing him in this unflattering display, I offered a helping hand by prying the small pit from his hands as he fought me, once Professor Zone quit trying to take it back I laid it again on one of the many glassy black stones that lined the forest, smashing the remnants of the fruit until it gave way into a pinkish nut. I scooped it up into my misshapen hand and bugged Professor Zone’s curled up form offering him the nut. Once he realized what I was doing he swiftly swiped it from my hand, trying to bite into it, the nut made a horrid screech as it fought against his teeth then it broke, but not too long after he spat it out, roughly wiping the remnants from his clean shaven face.  

“I appreciate the gesture Craig but I can’t tell if that was too ripe or premature. It was hard but also squishy and tasted sickly sweet.” Zone sighed as he spat. “I think I’d rather eat a bug.” A phantom of a smile crept over what I called my face.

*Well if he’s no longer above eating the bugs we could share a meal. It’s been longer than I can remember the last time someone was civil enough to eat with me.* I began to start wandering, drowning out the world around me as I delved deeper into my hopes of making a friend who can understand me. *Maybe he’d be willing to travel this baffling world with me. I mean after all once you get out of the pit you always find yourself asking the question of how could any of this be real. Life was prosperous above the pit, large fleshy birds flapping their oddly blunt wings through the rough seafoam like clouds and large wolves stalking the crimson brush wrapped in loose maroon skin resembling a sun bear more than any dog I’ve seen. Along with about a hundred other smaller but diverse creatures all playing their part in keeping each other alive. It’s almost hypnotic just watching the plains shift with life. But that was up there. Now all there is, is me, Professor Zone, and the bugs.* Zone interrupted my thoughts as he sat paranoid. 

"What? Why are you looking at me like that?" There was a short pause as we locked eyes. I had been oblivious to Zone’s greater discomfort. But I could feel a discomfort burning deep inside me, I was starving and only now began to notice.

My mind grew numb as my eyes tracked the land around us, searching for anything that moved or pulsed, as quickly as I spotted the beetle I pounced, pinning it beneath my club. The log sized beetle went berserk, trying desperately to thrash or bite but it was all for nothing once I was able to hook my fleshy claw on its shell cleft surrounding its face. The bug's movement grew more erratic alongside its squeals of mercy as I slowly pried its shell off with a meaty tear.  I smiled as I saw its raw flesh vulnerable and defenseless. I dug my clawed hand in its exposed tissue as the bug's body went into shock. Its legs dug up the crimson carpet, desperately trying to escape my iron grasp as I picked at the bug’s tendons till it could only squeal, a phantom of a chuckle escaped me as I picked up the bug now tearing its dysfunctional body in half. I lifted the skin that dangles over my rotted teeth to start eating. Professor Zone stared in horror and disgust, his elderly face warping into a horrid grimace and his jaw hanging open. To his distress, I offered him the chillingly limp butt end of the bug. 

"PUT THAT THING DOWN YOU BARBARIAN!" As Professor Zone commanded me, my face fell. I released the bug's carcass at his feet, the bug fell just before his legs hitting the ground with a splat, splashing its gutty works on Professor Zone’s pants. A faint phantom of a giggle escaped me as Professor Zone freaked out at the half witted bug, desperately kicking it away and frantically trying to wipe himself clean of the bug guts. Professor Zone looked at me, his face tired and fear filled as he shoved me, crushing my knotted flesh against my oddly sharp bones causing me to act on impulse and slam him against one of the monoliths. The gravity of what I had done didn’t quite grasp me till Professor Zone didn’t get back up, he sat crying as the monolith held him in place, tears streamed down his face as the monolith scorched his skin. The only thing I could bring myself to do was stare as his silent cries for help as they fell upon my deafened ears.
