When I was a kid I lived in a house that had a lot of strange happenings. There are many things we couldn't explain that happened there. This is just one of those many things. 

When I was six I used to sleep with my bed facing out of the hall. My bedroom was the one at the end of the hall. My bed had always faced that direction since I could remember. After this night my bed would be moved forever. 

My parents knew I didn't like to be shut up in the room alone because I was just a kid I was scared of everything. We had cats so it wasn't uncommon for us to hear certain noises at night but again this night was different.  

So it was 8:00 pm and my mommy was tucking me my blue racecar shaped bed. My family has always been a Christian household so my mom would sing to me at night hymns that she had been practicing for choir. After she was done she left my door open and said if I needed anything to just call her because her bedroom was right next to mine. The walls weren't too thick in my house so she can easily hear me if I called out. Then she turned my little night light on and left to turn off all of the lights in the house to save electricity of course.

I close my eyes and fell asleep for what seemed like 20 minutes. Really it had been an hour or two. It only felt like 20 minutes because I had been dreaming until I heard a noise. My eyes open wide as I look down the dark black hallway. I saw something Scurry past the end of the hall and I thought maybe it was one of the dumb cats. So I tried to close my eyes and just ignore it. The front door was at the end of the living room and after my eyes have been closed for a minute I heard knocking. It was a soft chipper knocking. It was quite slow one knock at a time. I heard that there were rats in the Attic but this was coming from the living room I just know it was. 

The knocking continued for what seemed like a minute or two. After too long I called out for my mom. At first she didn't answer so I called again. Then her and my dad came out of the room and I told them I heard knocking at the door. My dad went to the door and opened it looking outside into the blackness of night and then said there was nothing there. 

My mommy tucked me in again and told me maybe it was coming from the attic but I knew she was wrong. I closed my eyes and fell back to sleep. I woke up around 12:00 am. I know because I remember seeing the alarm clock. Midnight. I woke up because I something scurry past the hallway. Our kitchen was connected to the living room so it could have come from the kitchen. Again thinking it's one of the dumb cats I just chose to ignore it. Then the knocking started again and this time it was louder. It was echoing down the hall. I wasn't going to take this so instead of waiting this time I instantly yelled for my mom and dad loudly. They both ran into my room and asked what was wrong and I said I heard the knocking again. This time they both grumbled and looked upset. I told them just check please. My dad turned on the porch light and went outside looking around the house to see if anyone was there. Again he came in and said he found nothing. I asked if he checked the shed and he said no but no one would be there because it was locked. He turned off the porch light and locked the door and then we all went back to my room.  

My mom tucked me in again one more time but this time she told me if I heard the knocking again just ignoring go back to sleep it's probably the dumb cat. I said okay Mom and I went back to sleep.

3:00 am.... knock....knock....knock....knock. I opened my eyes and looked down that dark abyss of a hallway my childlike mind racing. This was no cat. It was loud and terrifying. I had thought back and remembered every time my parents checked for the sound. They never turned on the living room light or the kitchen light.... no this was impossible. They had to turn it on at least once I thought to myself. This was just a dumb cat being loud I thought to myself. I would force my mind to black out again and wake up and everything would be fine I thought to myself. The knocking continued for 5 minutes and then I blacked out. I had done it and forced myself to go to sleep.

This time I wake up and it's morning. I don't wake up like every other morning instead I awaken too loud noises of my parents panicking. My dad was a minister and still is to this day. He used to anoint the house every night before we went to sleep and ask for protection over us. I don't remember him doing it that night before we went to sleep. He was running to the living room with his olive oil which symbolize peace and protection based off of the olive branch that God sent Noah after the flood in the bible. 

I decide to get up out of my bed and with my vision blurry I walk to the living room down the long hallway. Once I get to the living room my vision starts to clear and I see that they are at the front door. You see my dad had kept an old ax in the shed and like I said he hadn't checked the shed. When I got to the door I'll never forget what I saw. There were axe marks all over the door frame. The axe marks looked mean and scary but what was very terrifying about all of this was that they were not on the outside of the door frame....  

They were on the inside.... There was something in our house.... 

And it wanted to get out...........
