I was 21 years old on the day of Mother's funeral. A milestone day that was usually spent with friends, drinking yourself into a stupor. For me, it was a day of sitting in a small, dank room with Mother’s coffin on a pedestal, surrounded by empty chairs. The funeral home director would have some of their employees attend the funeral if no guests showed up, which seemed like a good idea when it was first presented. However, seeing them shuffle in and sit emotionless in the back of the room filled me with a sense of shame. The thought that the only people, other than myself, who would attend her funeral did so out of obligation was too much to bear. I asked the director to send them away, and they left without a moment's hesitation. Most likely returning to their own friends and families, where they would live and never give that poor, lonely woman another thought.
	
I couldn’t blame them, though. Mother wasn’t the type of woman who wanted to be remembered. She had spent most of her life in isolation due to a deep-seated distrust of people, a belief that had taken root shortly after I was born. It had something to do with a man showing up at our doorstep when I was still a baby and causing a scene. She never liked to go into details about the incident and would quickly change the subject. I once asked her if the man was my father. Her face turned red, and she screamed at me to go to my room. That was the last time I ever asked about the man or my father. I was seven.
	
My name is Colin, but Mother always called me Lump, a nickname I acquired when I was still in school, before I was pulled out and placed in a homeschooling program. A group of older kids in first or second grade picked on me mercilessly and would call me Lump until I cried. I was born with a lump on the side of my stomach about the size of a softball. It posed no health issues, and Mother constantly told me that we didn’t have the money to have it removed. So, I lived with it and suffered the consequences of an uncaring healthcare system combined with the cruelty of children, but Mother did her best to help me feel better about it all.

“They’re just jealous,” she said from the front seat of our old station wagon. She opened the glove box for tissues and handed one back to me. “Dry those eyes, sweetie. They’re jealous because the lump you have, the lump you want gone so badly, reminds them that they aren’t loved as much as you are.”

“Why?” I asked through sniffles and a tissue.

“Well, I never told you this before, but what’s in that lump of yours is all the love I have for you. Before you were born, I loved you so much that it all gathered together in that lump.”

“Gross!” I screamed with a smile.

“Not gross at all. Now, no matter where I am and where you are, you’ll have a bit of my love with you, right there by your side in that lump.” 

“Okay.”

She looked up into the rearview mirror to glance back at me. “I had a love lump once, too. It was you, and now here you are. My little Lump.” She said with that silly baby voice that always made me laugh. We giggled about that the entire way home, and from then on, I was called Lump.
	
I was glad that she loved me because I didn’t seem to find much affection at school. I never got close to any of my classmates, and I rarely had friends who stuck around for more than a week or two. I may have moved on and accepted my new nickname, but that didn’t mean the bullying had stopped. If anything, it had gotten much worse.
Mother took me out of school once she found out that someone had taken a picture of me shirtless in the locker room. The picture was discovered when some boys got into a fight over who would get to keep the photo next. The fight got pretty rowdy, and one of them ended up breaking the other’s arm. Once we found out that the boys had just been suspended and that the matter was considered settled, Mother flipped out. She didn’t care that I was halfway through first grade and dragged me out.
	
“I will not have my boy paraded around as a freak!” she shouted as she pulled me by my arm through the school parking lot. She stopped at the principal’s parking spot and spat on his car. She looked back at the brick building where the principal, students, and teachers stood watching us through the window.

“Fuck you!” she screamed. “You should all feel ashamed!”

She switched to working nights, and during the day, between naps, she made sure I was doing my schoolwork. She wasn’t a great teacher, but she was patient and gave me all the attention she could. She worked herself ragged to take care of me, and that effort took a toll on her. I think she aged quicker than most people, primarily due to the stress of taking care of me on her own.

Her fear of me being harmed in some way grew and grew. We spent most of our free time indoors, venturing out only to the grocery store or to the backyard, but we rarely did much more than that. The isolation made it impossible for either of us to make or have friends. She played with me whenever I asked, and for a time, I thought that was enough. We fought constantly about my desire to leave the tiny world she had created for us. I called it a prison, and she called it our home. I wanted to travel and explore, while she wanted to stay and wait. It wasn’t until many years later that I began to realize just how deep her loneliness must have been. People are not meant to be alone, and when she died, that was a truth I learned very quickly. I attempted to carry on with my life as I had when she was alive, but the house was too quiet. Every creak and moan the house made reminded me of just how alone I was. Sitting at the dinner table and looking at her empty chair would cause me to weep. Not because I missed her, although I did, but I cried because I was alone. Truly alone.

The first bit of happiness I experienced after her passing came when I learned that she had left me a sizable inheritance. I had grown up believing we were relatively poor, barely scraping by. She had been very smart with her money. A few extremely lucky investments and her decision to live a budget-friendly life resulted in a small tidy sum of money. It was a settlement she received from the incident with the man arriving at our house when I was a baby. He was the doctor who delivered me when I was born. Something in him had snapped, and the hospital paid Mother a hefty sum to smooth things over and to avoid bad press. It wasn't enough for me to retire on, but it was sufficient enough that I wouldn't have to work much and I wouldn’t need to worry about that for a long time. The news felt like an anvil being lifted off my chest.

After a while, the joy turned bitter when I’d reach down and feel the lump in my side, wondering why she had lied all those years. Why would she claim that we couldn’t afford to have this growth removed? I had learned to accept it as part of me, but even so, being able to live my life without it would have brought some sense of normalcy to what had been, for the most part, a normal childhood.

I was 21 now, 21 and ready to spend Mother’s money on my surgery. I was prepared to begin living my life the way I wanted, a life of discovery and without fear. I would get the lump removed.

I sat on a cushioned table in the doctor’s office. The paper sheet crinkled beneath my bare bottom. This was all unfamiliar to me. I hadn’t been to a doctor’s office in decades, not since I was a baby. When the nurse handed me the gown, I had to ask her what I was supposed to do with it. 

She scrunched her eyebrows at me.“You get undressed and put this on.”

I began to unbutton my pants.

“Wait until I leave first,” she said abruptly.

My face felt like it was on fire with embarrassment. It was my first time at the doctor’s office, and I had almost accidentally shown my dinky to the nurse. She was pretty. The thought of her nearly seeing my dinky caused it to stir. I quickly tried to calm myself down while she was gone, thinking she might be back at any moment. The last thing I wanted to do was to show her my privates. Mother always said that was a sacred right that a beautiful soul had to earn.

I sat there for two hours. The clock on the wall taunted me with each tick. By the time the doctor came in, my legs were numb and tingly. I jumped down from the table to shake his hand, but my legs almost gave way. I caught myself with a stumble and kept my hand out for him to shake. He looked at me with a puzzled expression and ignored my outstretched hand. Instead, he snapped a latex glove over his fingers and onto his wrist.

“So let’s take a look at this, uh,” his voice trailed off. He picked up his clipboard briefly and set it back down. “Lump,” he said finally. He plopped down onto a short rolling stool and cleared his throat.

With that, I pulled the gown to the side so he could see.

He was old. Older than Mother had ever been. His hair was still blonde, though, and it fell in small, tight curls across his forehead. His face was unshaven, and his breath stank even though his teeth were unnaturally white. His glasses sat on the tip of his nose as he stared at my side.

“Interesting,” he said quietly.

He sat up straight and rolled back toward a machine before wheeling back with it.

“What is this?” I asked.

“This,” he said as he squirted a gel onto the tip of the wand, “this is an ultrasound.” He placed the wand on the lump, and the coldness caused me to recoil slightly.

“It’s going to be cold,” he said, slightly annoyed.

“What does it do?” I asked.

He licked his lips and then pursed them together as he looked up at me.

“It lets us see what’s in there,” he said as he pointed up to the screen. “Look up here at the screen. Whatever is in there, we’ll be able to see it in here.”

He moved the wand around as he stared at the screen. I couldn’t make heads or tails of what I was looking at.

“It’s not a tumor if that’s what you’re thinking,” he said matter-of-factly.  

His eyes suddenly widened. He turned his gaze to meet mine before looking back at the screen. He reached up and turned the screen so I could no longer see it.  

“What is it?” I asked.  

“Shhhh.”

He continued to rub the wand on me for nearly 30 minutes without saying a word. Anytime I spoke, he simply shushed me. A knock on the door finally managed to break his trance. The pretty nurse from before poked her head in and asked him if everything was alright.

“It’s fine,” he said hurriedly. He reached for the ultrasound and quickly pressed a few buttons. “Just getting a few pictures for this young man’s files.”

She began to leave when the doctor called back to her. “Nurse, these are printing out on printer three. That idiot in IT still hasn’t fixed this damn thing. Be a dear and grab them off the printer and put these in his files.”

The cute freckles across her nose and cheeks shifted as she scrunched her nose in annoyance. It was clear to everyone, save the doctor, that she did not like being called “Dear” and she did not like this man.

She left and closed the door behind her. The doctor looked at me and then back at the lump. 

I chuckled, “Mother always told me my lump was filled with her love. She said it was my love lump.” 

The doctor did not chuckle. “Well that’s just a load of horse shit,” he quipped as he rolled back toward the counter. He grabbed a pen and began writing.

“It’s nothing at all. Just a type of cyst. Easy enough to eliminate with medication. I want you to take two of these for a week. That’s one in the morning and one at night. Now say it back to me.

“Hm?

“Repeat it back to me so I know that you’re paying attention. What do I need you to do with this medication?”

“Oh. Take one in the morning and then take one at night.”

He handed me the prescription and as soon as my fingers touched it he pulled it back.

“Take it with food,” he said sternly.

“Ok. Twice a day with food. I’ve got it.”

“And come back to see me in a week. You should see a significant decrease by then. Do you have any questions for me?” he asked.

“I’ve had this for a really long time and I.”

“Perfect,” he said, cutting me off. “Well, if that’s everything, then I’ll see you in a week.”

He jumped to his feet and left me with my prescription. I pulled on my clothes, took the bus to the pharmacy, and got my pills. I got back home and poured them out of the bottle and onto the table. 

Fourteen pills. That’s all it would take to erase this thing from my life. All it would have ever taken to have given me a better childhood. It was hard not to be mad at Mother. It felt unfair that she wouldn’t be alive right now while I’m discovering this. That she’s not here for me to scream at. That she wouldn’t have to see me stomp my feet and smash the dishes felt unfair. There was a lack of just in the though that she wouldn’t have to clean up after the mess I made. No. She wasn’t there for any of that, but I did it anyway. I shouted until my voice went hoarse, and there were no more things to throw across the kitchen. I scooped up my first pill and swallowed it after dipping my lips under the faucet. I should have saved at least one cup to drink them down with, but my anger hadn’t allowed me the opportunity to think about the future. I cleaned up the mess as best I could and went to bed.

It had been two days since I started taking the medicine when I began to notice that my lump seemed to be growing. Occasionally, I felt a pain in my side. It was as if something in my gut was pressing against my insides and slithering around. It was enough to make my hair stand on end, so I reached out to the doctor’s office to schedule an appointment.

Three days later, I was able to see my doctor. By this time, there was no doubt in my mind that the lump had grown. What was once the size of my fist was now easily twice as large. It weighed heavily on my side and pulled the skin taut, but it no longer hurt, and I no longer noticed the slithering I had felt the day before.

I didn’t have time to sit down once I entered the office. As soon as I told the woman at the front desk that I was there for my appointment, a nurse came through a door in the back and asked me to follow her. I followed her to the same room I had waited in just a few days earlier. Upon entering, I noticed a change in the room since my last visit. There in the corner sat the doctor. He jumped to his feet and reached out his arm, beckoning me to take a seat.

“Please, please,” he said quickly as he ushered me toward the already reclined patient’s table. “Have a seat.”

As I sat down, he whipped out the ultrasound machine and abruptly reached for my shirt, beginning to pull it up. I swatted his hand away.

“Hey, slow down.” I snapped at him.

“I don’t have all day, young man. Now let me do my job and see what we’ve got here.”

His eyes refused to wander. The doctor’s gaze was fixed firmly on the lump beneath my shirt. He seemed out of breath as he began to lightly pant. The stench emanating from between his teeth and gums drifted into my nose. It’s better to just get this over with quickly, I thought to myself. I reluctantly brought my fingers down to the hem of my shirt and lifted it. As soon as the lump emerged, the doctor let out an audible gasp. His eyes widened as he stared at my side. He lifted his old, wrinkled hand and gently let a finger caress my side.

“So what’s the issue? Why is it growing?” I asked.

The sound of my voice in the quiet office startled the doctor out of his stupor. He grabbed the ultrasound and began applying the clear jelly to it. He pressed it to my side again, and I was once more startled by how cold it was. He rubbed the wand back and forth, staring at the monitor. This continued for several moments, with only the sound of his hot, rank breathing breaking the silence.

“Well?” 

“There’s nothing wrong with it,” he said faintly, the wand still moving back and forth.

“That doesn’t make any sense,” I said with a tinge of irritation as I grabbed the side of the monitor to pull it into view.

“No!” He shouted.

The sound of his booming voice coming from his withered, old body made me jump, and I let go of the monitor.

“It’s grown so much since I started taking the medicine.”

“Haven’t you ever heard the saying that it needs to get worse before it gets better?” He said through gritted teeth.

“Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate your help.” I jumped down from the table.

“But,”

“But, I think I’m going to see about getting a second opinion about this.” My eyes drifted to the ground. I could feel his eyes burning a hole through my forehead, and the air in the room felt thick from the tension.

“They’ll tell you the same thing I did, boy.” He growled. “I’ve been practicing medicine since before you were born.”

“It’s nothing personal. I just want to explore my options.” I dashed out the door and briskly walked down the hallway towards the exit. The doctor slammed the door open hard enough that it shook the walls. He stomped out of the examination room. He was frail and old. I could easily outrun him, but his voice proved to be more challenging to escape.

“You petulant piece of shit, get back here!

His shouts followed me down the hallway and out of the building. I could faintly hear him from outside, and I sprinted towards the nearest bus stop a few blocks away. I arrived just as the bus opened its doors. I climbed the stairs and made my way to a seat, plopped down, and slouched in my seat. I knew it was unlikely that the doctor would have followed me this far or this quickly, but I shuddered at the thought that he might spot me riding past and take the opportunity to hurl more insults my way.

As I sat slumped down and hiding, my phone rang. It was a number I did not recognize. This had to be the doctor. He was calling me to give me an earful. It rang in my hands as I stared blankly at the screen. There was nothing on Earth that would make me answer that call. It finally stopped ringing. I tilted my head back in relief and stared at the gum stuck to the ceiling. Ding. My eyes shot back down. A voicemail. I pressed play and lifted the phone to my ear. What I heard wasn’t the doctor. To my surprise, it was a young voice. A woman’s voice. Kind and gentle.

“Hi, I’m a nurse at the Wellspring clinic, my name is Celeste. I’m calling for Colin, and I just want to say I am so sorry. I just saw and heard how Dr. Richards treated you, and I am so sorry. Please, please call me back when you get an opportunity.”

Her voice had a soothing quality to it that lulled me into a peace I hadn’t felt since Mother was still alive. It brought me comfort, something I thought I would never know again. This was the day my life changed forever.
