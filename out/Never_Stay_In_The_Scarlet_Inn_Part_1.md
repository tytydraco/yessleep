God ok I'm typing this on my phone and freaking out so please excuse any shitty punctuation or grammar. God they don't even have wifi here I gotta use my data

Alright I'll start from the beginning. 

My name is Marcus Anderson. This all started when my brother-in-law, Xavier, thought it would be a good idea to take a road trip with some friends. I didn't wanna go but my husband, Edward, insisted that I humor his brother. I still wasn't sold until I was told we were going to Vegas. Me and Edward went there for our honeymoon, so it would've been nice to go back. 

Edward helped me pack my bags into our friend's van. It was one of those types you'd see at a local church that could carry about a dozen people. When I got in the van, I was happy to see Xavier actually got a few more of our friends to join us. Driving the van was Rachel, she owned the van. She worked with Xavier at a law firm. Of course Xavier was there, sitting passenger. Kayla, Rachel's best friend was also there. And finally, my best friend, that son of a bitch Timothy Young.

"Took you long enough! The Hell did you pack, your entire bedroon?!"

I playfully punched Timothy in the arm and laughed with him, sitting next to him, and Edward next to me.

We prepared for the longest road trip of our lives. From Davenport, Iowa and all the way to Las Vegas, Nevada.

It took about 13 hours, a few rest stops, and each of us taking a turn driving while the rest nap or eat before we decided we needed to stop somewhere for the night. We were somewhere in Colorado at the time. After many, many wrong turns, we ended up in a small town called Spar City. It was late, about 9 pm, and yes that means Xavier, in his infinite wisdom, decided to start the trip at 10 pm. 

The town looked quite nice, it was one of those towns that kept it's look from the early 1900s, a beautiful glance into the past. At the end of the road was the largest of the buildings, surpringly large compared to the rest of the town. It wasn't a skyscraper by any means, but it was still large. As we drove up to it, we saw a sign illuminated by spotlights.

*"The Scarlet Inn."*

"Welp," Timothy spoke up as he parked the van, having taken his driving shift last, "might as well see if they're open. You guys wait here, I'll check the door."

"Are.. are we sure about this?" Kayla interrupted before Tim had a chance to get out. She sounded a bit scared.

"Ah come on, what are you, chicken?" Tim replied. 

Kayla started to respond, sounding upset. "That's not-"

She was cut off by Tim bocking at her. I tried my best not to laugh a little.

"Hey man knock if off. Just go check the door." Rachel spoke up, interrupting Tim's antics. 

"Alright alright I'll go check it." Tim got out of the van and walked to the door, checking to see if it was unlocked. It was. He gave us a thumbs up and started walking back to get his bags. We all got out to do the same. I needed some help with my bags. Tim was a bit right, I definitely overpacked. 

We lugged all of our bags up to the front desk. The clerk stood there, smile on his face. He spoke in a cheerful tone.

"Oh welcome to The Scarlet Inn! It isn't everyday we get this many guests in! How many rooms for you?"

After a little discussion, we decided we'd save some money and split in between 3 rooms. Me and Edward, Xavier and Tim, and Kayla and Rachel.

"Three rooms it is then!"

The clerk said, getting us three keys. Not keycards, actual metal keys. Rooms 66, 67, and 68 respectively. He took out a sign in sheet, and we all signed it.

"I'll get the bellboys to get your stuff up to your rooms. There's a trivia night in the dining hall, it starts in about 15 minutes. You should go sign up, the winners get a cool trophy. And a cash prize!"

The clerk spoke with a smile. Looking back now, I don't think the clerk stopped smiling or blinked once the entire time.

We all headed to the dining room, having to follow the signs so we wouldn't get lost. We still got lost. We made it to the dining room though, just in time to sign up. As soon as we entered the dining room, everything felt... off. Everyone in the dining room was dead silent and smiling. There wasn't even a small number of them either, there must've been 40 or 50 people. When we walked in, they all turned to look at us. I felt a chill run down my spine but for some reason I just shrugged it off. I guess I thought I was just being paranoid or something. 

"We're um... we're here for the trivia night?" Xavier said rather loudly.

There was a moment of silence, and then in an instant, everyone seemed to just start acting normal. Talking to each other, laughing and joking with the people at their tables.

"... what the fuck just happened?" Rachel whispered to us. I could tell by her voice she was extremely freaked out.

"I don't know but let's just go find somewhere to sit" Edward chimed in. As much as I loved my husband, I hated how he had a tendency to just accept or explain away anything weird or odd.

We headed to an empty table and sat down. There was a man standing at the front of the room, dressed in a way too nice suit for a man running a trivia night. He spoke up, smiling and just a cheerful as the front desk clerk.

"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Scarlet Inn's trivia night! There's a button on your table. If you want to answer, be the first to hit the button! Don't hit it too soon because if I don't finish the question, you'll be locked out from answering! Okay? Okay!"

He finished off his sentence with a little laugh. His first few questions were normal. What's the largest planet in our solar system? Who painted The Starry Night? Who's the lead singer for AC/DC? And so on. None of us hit the button fast enough for the first few questions.

"Who played Buzz Lightyear in Toy Sto-"
Kayla slammed her down on the button before the man got to finish the question, but she didn't get to answer. Instead, she screamed and pulled her hand back. It was bleeding, full of glass shards.

"Woah what the hell?!" Rachel yelled and instantly started trying to help Kayla stop the bleeding. 

Tim grabbed some napkins from the table, starting to clean the blood off the table and Kayla. Edward and Xavier too confused and shocked to say anything.

"Oh I am so sorry!" The man shouted from the front of the room. "You hit the button before I was finished!"

"What the fuck is wrong with you?!" Rachel yelled at the man. "You goddamn psychopa-"

She stopped, dead silent. Her face drained of color. I was confused until I looked towards the man, and I froze too. Every single person in the room was staring at us. Smiling, wider than they should be able to. Unblinking. I was horrified. The only thing that snapped me out of it was Rachel grabbing my shoulder.

"We need to get out of here."

There wasn't a single protest from anyone in the group. We all knew we needed to get the fuck out. This place wasn't normal, we couldn't pretend it was. We all rushed to the front desk, the clerk still there, our bags now gone.

"Is everything alright?" He asked, cheerful as ever. 

"No everything isn't alright! You all are fucking crazy! We're leaving!"

The clerk frowned, his entire face changed to a mix of anger and sadness. His change in demeanor freaked me out.

"You need to sign out firs-"

"THEN GIVE US THE GODDAMN SHEET!" Rachel screamed at him. I've never seen her this angry before. 

The clerk reached into a drawer, and placed the sign out sheet in front of her. Rachel signed the sheet and set her key on the desk.

Right as she did, the clerk suddenly stood up, grabbed Rachel by the hair, and stabbed her in the throat. It all happened so fast, we didn't have time to react. Kayla screamed, Tim fell and almost fainted. I couldn't move, I was horrified.
The clerk pulled the knife out of Rachel's neck and pushed her to the ground. Edward threw up when the blood started to spew out and Rachel started choking on her own blood. God the sound, the gurgles, I'm never going to unhear it. Kayla got on the ground and tried to stop the blood coming out from Rachel's neck. She wasn't able to do much, especially with just one hand. There wasn't anything that was gonna help Rachel. She bled out, right there on the floor. 

The clerk climbed over his desk and grabbed Xavier. Before he could stab him, Edward screamed out. 

"WAIT!"

The clerk froze. 

"W-We'll stay! Okay? We'll stay!"

The clerk let Xavier go and instantly went back to his unnaturally and creepily happy and cheerful demeanor. 

"Lovely!"

The clerk looked down at Rachel's dead body, Kayla sobbing and kneeling next to it. 

"Oh, please do excuse the mess. We'll have that taken care of right away."

He looked back up at us.

"Breakfast is from 6 am to 11 am tomorrow. *Don't miss it.*"
