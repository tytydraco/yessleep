Hell isn't what I thought it would be. I spent most of my life preaching the teachings of Jesus to a congregation who'd placed their full trust in me to guide their actions and provide spiritual leadership. As I came to learn on the night of my death, no amount of repentance could save my soul. After all, if I played by the rules: acknowledge that I am a poor sinner, confess those sins to Almighty God, accept Jesus Christ into my heart, I would be home free. 

I was wrong.

I don't know how it began, but the end came the night I drove myself home from the bar.

I pulled into my garage with a sense of satisfaction. The bartender told me I'd had too much; that he'd call me a cab. But I knew better, and I knew myself. I was fine to drive home. I put the car in park. My keys slipped from my fingers as I stepped out. I bent over to pick them up, thankful that the garage light above me illuminated everything. I thought, *I could use a drink,* so I made my way into the house. *Not bad, Joel,* I thought. *A picture perfect drive home, save maybe a little road kill.* 

I stepped inside and made a beeline for the cupboard. My own personal rail vodka waiting for me. Thankfully, even in the dark, I strode with confidence through the house. I always kept it clean in case I hosted guests. It’s important to keep things tidy.

The only light on was the one above the stove. The digital clock read 2:47 AM. I chuckled to myself because I’d been out later than usual. I hummed a tune from the bar jukebox and tripped over a kitchen chair. I saluted the chair and happily continued humming along.

I opened the cupboard and grabbed the bottle of vodka and a glass. Twisting off the cap to pour, I heard a floorboard creaking in the next room. I lived alone, so this was unusual. My senses suddenly heightened, and my jovial demeanor quickly turned to paranoia. I placed the bottle down and turned my ear toward the adjacent living room. There was only silence. I told myself, *It's an old house. Old bones shift all the time.* I returned to fixing my drink. I went to grab a soda from the fridge, when I heard it again. I turned back towards the room when something, obscured in the shadows, caught my eye. A head. A shoulder. An arm. I was so startled I dropped my soda, but by the time I picked up the bottle, the shadow was already gone.

I hit the side of my head, like an old TV that couldn't find a clear channel. What was paranoia turned into fear. What was fear had turned into frustration.

*What is wrong with me?* I thought. *Don't answer that.*

I savored my vodka Sprite to great satisfaction. I looked at the time. 2:54 AM. I belched and shuddered at the thought of the sun coming up in a few hours. What I had just heard…and seen, had to have been my imagination. Although, my dad always told me I had a lack of imagination. *That bastard*. I sighed. Even though he's been dead for years, he still had a way of sneaking into my head. I slunk down the hall towards the bedroom, kicking my shoes off along the way. I slipped into my room and fell onto the bed, a little disoriented, and a little sad. I laid still and shut my eyes. The moment before I faded away, I found the barrel of my handgun resting on my nightstand. Contented and reassured, I drifted off to sleep.

"Joel," whispered a voice. It was distant, certainly not in the room. My eyes burst wide open. Did I really hear that? I remembered the creaking floorboards; the shadow I thought I'd seen. Now I was hearing things?

I looked at the clock. 3:10. *Fuck, had I even fallen asleep yet?* I wanted to fall back asleep, but my bladder had other plans. I heaved my body off the bed and crept across the hall into the bathroom. By now, I couldn't really ignore the things I was hearing. As I pissed, I thought I heard the creaking sound again from down the hall. I listened as carefully as I could, but there was only silence. 

However, as soon as I stepped into the hall, I heard it again. This time, the creaking was accompanied by a shifting thud. The rhythmic footsteps were coming towards me. This time it was unmistakeable. *Thump, shift, thump, pause, thump.*  I stared down the hall, but saw nothing, though the thumping drew closer. and I dove back into my room, to the safety of my bed. I listened to the movements and tried, in vain, to find a rational explanation. I covered my mouth with my hand and noticed how much I was trembling. My fingers wrapped around my face, slick from beads of sweat.

Was I going insane? Either there was someone in the house, or I was hallucinating. I laughed to myself. Hauntings are an abomination against God. As far as I was concerned, even if there was a ghost in this house, there's nothing it could do to me. I forced a chuckle, and rolled over to reset my mind. 

Staring back at me was the grinning face of a woman. The flesh was ripped from her face, dangling off her cheekbone like torn curtains. Her skin was speckled with black, pepper-like gravel. Her eyes were bugged out; maniacal. Staring at everything, and seeing nothing. Her teeth were gritting and grinding. They made a sandy, crackling sound, then, *POP!* Her jaw fell slack and wide. From her gaping mouth came a labored, raspy moan, accompanied by the rancid sweet odor of death.

I shrieked and shot out of bed and stumbled down the hall. I rushed and crept lower and lower to the floor.. *What in the hell was that?* I barreled down the hall, back to the kitchen, past the dark living room, and into the garage once again. The motion sensor lit up the garage and exposed the front of the car. 

It was smashed. 

*What the fuck happened to my car?* I staggered towards the vehicle. There was a dark substance streaked across the hood. I ran my fingers through the brownish, red liquid. 

It was blood. The face of that woman flashed in my mind.

The lights above my head started to flicker and swing to and fro. Every can, tool, and item fell to the floor all helter skelter. The refrigerator rattled and shook with fury, and I knew that I was no longer safe in my own home. Nothing that happened made any logical sense, so I cried out to God. 

“LORD, my sins are not deserving of this! Have you really forsaken me?” I shouted to the ceiling. I shut my eyes and continued to pray. I asked for a reprieve from the demonic activity all around me. I, a 40-year old pastor, begged for mercy, even hoping for death. My begging for forgiveness morphed into a demand. “I am in service to the Lord, my God, and this is how I am repaid? You are supposed to be my refuge, my fortress!”

I raised my eyes to the rattling chaos around me. My knuckles turned white, clasped in each other. By then the room looked like a tornado was blowing through. I tried to focus on faith. I'm afraid, however, that prayer alone wasn't enough to quell my fears in this moment of tribulation. Perhaps I was all out of faith. I wanted to shut my eyes as this unseen force threw debris around the garage like a veritable storm. From the passenger side of the car, I looked to the crunched, bloodstained hood. The realization flooded my eyes that this was my ultimate sin.

Then, like an abominable sunrise, I saw her head appear over the hood. Glistening from the cranial fracture, her hair was gnarled and greasy. Her eyes peered through me mindlessly, her moans grew into a deafening howl. The woman rose from behind the hood of the car, levitating. I witnessed further carnage to her body. Her mangled limbs hung slack. Her entrails dragged on the floor despite her twisted feet floating inches off the ground. One outstretched arm reached for me.

"God, please," I pleaded. "I don't want to live with this." I shut my eyes tight, and my world turned black.

The next thing I sensed was sunlight. The terror had subsided, and left behind in the dream world.

I was back in my bed. How I got there, I don't quite know. The sunshine filling my room made it hard to open my eyes. I practically had to pry them open. I sat up, head pounding. 

*Shit, Joel, you really did it this time,* I thought. 

I made my way to the bathroom, almost blind, my eyes only slightly open. I gulped down as much water as I could. I swallowed some Tylenol and sat on the edge of the bathtub with my head in my hands.

"Joel," I heard someone say. 

I opened my eyes. The weirdness of the previous night crept back in, and my heart sank. I had thought I was home free.

“Joel, come in here.” The voice was more stern, and striking than before. 

I rose to my feet, nearly ready to obey the voice. And what was this? I distinctly heard activity coming from my kitchen. Sizzling frying pans? Clanking utensils? I stepped into the hallway, in disbelief that someone was actually in my kitchen. Was this the same person I saw last night? It couldn't be. She was basically dead—a zombie—but she wasn't even real, was she? This voice, on the other hand, was distinctly male.

"Come on in, Joel. Sit." The voice beckoned me into my own kitchen. I peered back into my room, and noticed my gun was not on the nightstand like it was the night before, when I felt it with my hand. I looked back down the hall and decided to see for myself.

The stranger was tall and thick, and wore a black chef's coat with red buttons down the front, black pants, and black boots.

"Gah, dammit," he said, then laughed. "I tried to do the thing Anthony Bourdain taught me, but I just can't get it right. Do you mind if your eggs aren't runny?" 

I stared at the strange, hulking man, unsure of what to make of him. His face was disarming, even merry. His hair was dark, so even though he was clean shaven, his stubble was visible.

He scanned me up and down and said, "Don't worry about appearances, Joel. They are the least embarrassing thing about you. Sit." His tone was now more authoritative.I sat at the table and observed him plating the food. He carried two plates to the table and placed one in front of me, and one on the opposite side of the table. "Ah," he said, with a snap of a finger. "No breakfast is complete without coffee." He turned back to the kitchen, and I looked at the plate in front of me: Eggs Benedict, sure enough. Beautifully prepared and garnished with chives and parsley. It smelled divine.

I observed him slowly plunging the filter into a French Press coffee maker. He poured it equally into two cups, then set them on the table before sitting down with a contented sigh. "Cream? Sugar?" He smiled. I shook my head and reached for the coffee mug. I watched as he sipped the coffee and closed his eyes. "Ecstasy," he said. "Well?" He gestured with his hand open. There were markings on his palm I couldn't decipher, but I saw geometric shapes and lines intersecting with each other. 

I took one sip of the coffee. It was the most heavenly, delicious coffee I'd ever experienced. A not-too-heavy mouth feel, and a distinct olfactory slap of graham cracker and black cherry. It was the best I'd felt since I started drinking the night before. I felt my appetite come roaring back and could barely contain my excitement to eat the eggs.

The stranger cut into his benedict. Each new bite yielded a fresh look of pleasure. His moans sounded orgasmic. I took my first taste. I'd never had a benedict so perfectly creamy. Buttery, savory, and with a lemony lift that tingled the jaw with each bite.

"Good Christ," I moaned.

"Yes," he responded, wiping the corner of his mouth with a napkin. He'd already finished his plate. He chuckled, "Don't mind me, I have an insatiable appetite. You could say I am *all* appetite. Please, enjoy it, Joel."

At this point, I must tell you that I didn't know if this was real, or if it was a dream, and to be honest, I didn't really care. The only thing in my world was the sheer decadence of the meal before me. The last bite was as satisfying as the first, and the coffee was a period at the end of a line of poetry. He observed me the whole meal.

"What'd you think?" the stranger asked.

"I don't think I've ever experienced anything quite like that," I said, smiling.

"Honesty, Joel. It's not that hard, is it?"

I looked at him inquisitively. His tone struck a discordant balance between carefree levity and grave seriousness. "So, who are you?" I asked.

"Joel, I'm simply a being who appreciates the finer things: A good lay, a good nap, and a good meal. And you ask me who I am after I've already fed you. It really shows where you place your values. Take something from me, then demand an explanation?"

My ego was threatened. I doubled down, "No, you're in *my* house, and I deserve to know who you are."

"And the only reason you haven't done anything about it, is because you're smaller than I am, right? Poor Joel."

Then I was angry. "You don't scare me. If I wanted to I could—"

"You could what, Joel? Shoot me?" he held up my holster, smiling, taunting me. "Oh, don't be so upset." He tossed the gun toward the middle of the table. "Go on, then.”

I looked at my pistol like it was a snake waiting to strike.

"Stand your ground, Joel," he said. "I barged into your house brandishing eggs. Take your pistol and stroke it like you stroke yourself."

I was seething, but something wouldn't let me reach for the gun.

The stranger leaned back. "Listen, Joel," his tone shifted back to amiable. "Once upon a time it was my job to help individuals exercise their free will. I was sort of a life coach, you know? I hated that shit."

I looked at the stranger in front of me dressed in black chef's clothing. "So, you became a chef?"

He laughed from his belly and wiped a tear from the corner of his eye. "That's a good one! Actually, I got into cooking pretty recently. I never really had the time, but I find that it's a nice way to bring people to the table for…" He paused, searching for the word. "Shall we say discussions like these."

"Discussions.”

"Yeah, well, they are hard talks. Contrary to what you've heard, I'm not that bad, okay?"

"What I've heard?" I asked, "We've never met before, how could I know who you are?"

The stranger chuckled, "You've had my name in your mouth an awful lot over the years." He stared at me, wondering if I was getting the clues.

I wasn't.

"Would you like me to start from the most recent and we can work our way backwards? Or should we start from the beginning?"

"Just tell me your name and then we can talk about whatever you want," I said.

With playful frustration, the stranger said, "Oh come on, Joel. You might be a killer, a rapist, and a bigot, but you're not stupid."

The blood drained from my face, but I mustered the courage to say, "What did you just call me?"

The stranger gestured over my shoulder at the door to the garage. The door swung open by itself, showing the crunched up car hood. I whipped my head back around to see the stranger shaking his head in disapproval. 

"Cheryl Melnik," he said. He put reading glasses on his nose and pulled a phone from his pocket. "Second shifter at the Mobil station on Main, mother of Shawn, aged 6. Shawn is a child of an absent father, and says he wants to be a Forest Ranger when he grows up. Cheryl worked sixty to seventy hours a week to ensure Shawn would never have to worry about the things she worried about. Once he graduated high school, she dreamed of getting an engineering degree. You've met Cheryl, right? At least twice last night, if I'm not mistaken."

I gulped. I was breathless and cold. I trembled as if I’d just met my personal executioner.

"Are you God?" I asked.

"Why? Because I showed up after your prayers? I kind of liked the Poltergeist bit with all the wind messing up your garage. Fun touch." He looked at me the way a cat looks at a mouse. Cats rarely kill their prey mercifully. 

"I prayed. I sinned, and I repented."

"You begged God to take away your guilt in a drunken stupor, is what you did. It went through the channels, and I decided to come and talk to you."

"So are you an angel, or…?"

"Joel, just last weekend you preached in your church, didn't you?"

I nodded.

"And what was your sermon about?"

"Turn or burn," I said.

"Clever. Did you get that from some clowns protesting the Gathering of the Juggalos?"

"I always want to guide my congregation, spiritually, to turn towards God, and to turn away from Satan and his decadent charm."

"Nice of you to say, Joel. Have you got me figured out yet?" His look was reminiscent of a magician after the trick.

I breathed heavily, refusing to believe I was in the presence of a fallen angel.

"Deceiver," I said.

The stranger rolled his eyes. "I don't like that nickname. Christian propaganda. "

"Why should I believe you are The Devil? Even if you were, I *am* a Christian, and I have sworn to turn away from you. I rebuke you in the na—-" My voice choked up.

"Save your self-righteous platitudes," the stranger said, "God didn't answer your prayer. *I* did."

I tried speaking again, "God made me in His image, and though I am a poor sinner, I am a being of His."

"God made a lot of things, but They most certainly had nothing to do with you. I can guarantee that. You, Joel, are the outcome of cum. You were a lazy person's answer to the meaning of life. And God? They wouldn't have wasted a breath on you."

"They?" I asked.

"The problem with you 'pious' types is your myopic view of the incomprehensible to explain your small world.” He raised an eyebrow and turned his nose down at me. “Do you think I would confine myself to the guardrails of something as stupid as a gender binary?” He leaned back and crossed his arms; his derision clear in his face. “I am infinitely more divine than you could ever hope to be, and you perceive me as nothing more than pure evil in a masculine skin. It's boring," he punctuated with a shrug.

"I am not afraid of you," I said.

The stranger sighed, as though he expected such a response. “Whether you fear me or not really doesn’t matter, Joel.” He reached once again for the smart phone.

"Would you like to tell me anything about Brianna Baker? Or do we need a refresher?"

I remembered Brianna. I bowed my head and began to pray again, "Heavenly father, you are my refuge, my fortress, my—"

"Joel? Where are we?" The voice belonged to a young woman. 

The stranger turned his head to the doorway leading from the kitchen, then back at me expectantly. 

I looked, and I saw a statuesque young woman in the door frame. She was beautiful, dressed in a sweater and a skirt. 

I remembered her.

"Can you take me home, please?" She said the words, but her expression was blank; distant. "No, I don't want to," she whimpered, standing completely still, unaware of Joel sitting at the table.

"Brianna Baker," the stranger began. "Twenty years old when you met her.” He paused, and his eyes got wide. "At *Bible study*, Joel? Really?"

"Brianna really liked me," I asserted.

"Wait, tell me if you recognize this." The stranger cleared his throat. "Wanna get into the sacramental wine, Brianna?" He was using my voice, my words. His face emasculated me. "It's okay, Brianna, it's communion…Here, have another…It's not a sin if it's in covenant…It's hot in here, let's take off your—"

"Stop!" I shut my eyes tight, but the image of Brianna was burned in my head.

"Cute girl, Joel. Smart as hell, too." He strained to read the phone. "Says here she got a free ride to Auburn on a swimming scholarship and was only able to graduate after extensive inpatient psychiatric treatment. She survived you, Pastor Joel, but at what cost?"

I hugged myself to cover my shame. I *am* repulsive. I looked at the gun in the middle of the table. Bumps and ripples danced across my flesh. I shuddered.

"You don't look so good, Joel," said The Devil.

Defeated, I hung my head and cried, "I have sinned."

The Devil waited.

"I just…I'm sorry."

The Devil shook his head.

"Joel, what are you saying sorry for?" He was quizzing me.

"For my sins, for being me," I said.

The Devil lifted the phone again, "Israel Corado killed himself." I gave him the wrong answer.

I was confused now. Rubbing my arms, I questioned The Devil, hoping there was some mistake. I hadn't heard that name before. "Nice try, but that name means nothing to me."

"No, but maybe Isabel does? What about Vickie and Julio Corado?"

I paused, recalling those names. "Vickie and Julio have a daughter named Isabel. They came to me when Isabel claimed she was a boy."

"Pray, tell, Joel, how does a hip, young pastor like you guide these good people spiritually?"

"I prayed with them. I quoted the scripture. Genesis 1:27-28 says that you are made in the image of God as a man or as a woman for the *purpose* of procreation. For *Godly* marriage. Isabel was defiant. Isabel was rebellious. I instructed Julio to insist that Isabel pray for her to return to faith."

"Well, those people really trusted you, didn't they?"

"That's my job as a pastor," I said.

"Quote, 'If you normalize how she feels, you are spitting in the face of God,' end quote," said The Devil. "*Israel*, Joel."

"Israel," I said.

The Devil said, "The name Israel means 'God perseveres.' It means Israel chose that name as a sign of strength and faith, despite being ostracized from his church; despite all the poison you fed Vickie and Julio. And now he's gone."

I knew about the suicide. Vickie and Julio stopped coming to church, and I never called them or checked on them to see how they were doing.

The Devil said, "Israel is not in Hell, Joel."

"Stop taunting me. Leave me alone y-you… you thief, you liar! You will never have my soul. I rebuke you. Go away."

The Devil dismissed me, "Joel, one thing the Catholics got right about Hell, is that it is the absence of God's love." The Devil slipped the black device into a pocket. "I'm not surrounded by little demon gremlins burning sinners for all eternity. Eternal damnation is a pretty new concept."

I stared into the middle distance, too exhausted to fight The Devil. Still, I clasped my hands for prayer. I bowed my head compulsively.

The Devil leaned forward. He looked like either a school guidance counselor or a cop. It was hard to tell which. He spoke in a low tone, almost sympathetic, "Joel, listen. I've been around a long time. I arrived very shortly after The Creator breathed life into the cosmos. Most of the stuff you understand about Heaven and Hell is little more than fan-fic. Human-made. Remember what I said about your 'myopic view' of the world? The reality is indescribable."

The heaviness of my actions weighed on me. I slunk in my chair, weak; exhausted.

"I've been around for a long, long year. I haven't worked in any official capacity in centuries, Joel."

"Worked?" I sighed.

"Yeah, the Bible gets most of it wrong, heh."

"What is all this, then? What are we doing here?"

The Devil inhaled, like he was bracing me for some hard news. It was the first time he seemed moved by anything.

"The Creator never intended for any of this to be worshiped. Some gratitude from time to time is nice, but really They meant humans to be custodians of the land. And y'all apparently couldn't handle that, what with all the genocide, war, and industrial waste. The Black Death took a pretty big toll on Them, and They faded away shortly after."

With tears in my eyes, I asked, "G-God is dead?"

"Death is a human idea, yeah. Ghosts are real. You saw one last night.” He pointed at me. “You are haunted. You live in the *absence* of God's love, because They are not there."

"So why did you come?” I said, before ingratiating him, “If–If I could ask."

"I appreciate that, Joel.” The Devil filled his lungs and said, “The things that men do to each other really disgust me. The prayers I heard during the Holocaust were overwhelming. Rather than comfort those who asked God for help, I paid visits to the ones who carried out atrocities and still kept The Creator on their tongue and equated *me* with those they sought to extinguish: Devilish, demonic vermin, they called us. I had a chat with Himmler and Hitler before they, you know," He gestured with his finger like a gun to his temple. "I simply came to offer some perspective as the walls closed in on them. So, yeah. I'm devilish, demonic vermin. It's because of people like *you* who use scripture as immutable justification for your hatred. Your piety gives you inherent license to kill and rape as long as you say, 'Oops, sorry!' You remind me of Ted Haggard, Joel. Remember that preacher who railed against same-sex marriage, but was actually railing the dude who sold him crystal meth? What characters you are!"

Once more, my ears perked up to the sound of creaking floorboards in the next room. I whipped my head towards the darkened room, fearful of what might be staring back at me. I sniffed the air and noticed the familiar pungence of cigarettes and aftershave. I heard the heavy steps of work boots coming closer. Only his jeans and tucked in plaid shirt were visible from the threshold.

"Dad?" I called out, but there was no reply. I turned to The Devil, outraged. "Now I know why you're showing me this."

The Devil shrugged. "I'm not *showing* you anything," he said. “These are *your* ghosts."

I looked back at the obscured older man lingering in the shadows. I rose from my chair and walked towards him. I came within mere feet and fell to the ground and wept.

The Devil observed me from the kitchen table. He removed his reading glasses, and said, "He never really loved you, Joel. I think you know that."

I bawled on the floor, debased to a childlike state. I found myself in the fetal position, ugly crying at the foot of this specter. This larger-than-life figure of a man who I knew was my father. I knew he didn't love me. I *wanted* him to love me. I was nothing more than a burden to him, and he let me know, full stop, that he was disinterested in me developing as a person. That's why he hit me and mom. That's why, even when I got a B+ on a test, he chided me for failing to get an A. That's why he reminded me, weekly, that the day I turned eighteen was the day I moved out. That's why he blamed me for Mom's death. That I was the reason for her heart failure. That I was the reason he drank.

The Devil spoke, "Generally, I don't speak ill of children, but seeing the man you became, maybe your father was on to something, Joel." He chuckled, but there was no humor in it.

I felt my skin pulsing and bubbling. I itched and shivered. I crept across the floor, frenetic. I peeled the clothes off my body as the itching crossed over into pain. I found no comforts, no refuge, no fortress. Only loneliness and dread. I crawled my way through the kitchen, attempting to get to my room. I wanted to pray. I wanted anything but this.

There was blood on the floor, dripping from above. I turned my eyes up and saw Cheryl floating over me again. Her slack-jaw and bugged eyes didn't fill me with fright like it had earlier. Instead, it filled me with sadness. Her floating body turned with me. Staring at me and seeing nothing. I was nothing.

Cheryl's guts dragged, and dad's boots thumped. I looked down the darkened hallway and saw the outline of something. Something new. Something squat and low to the ground. Through the teary windows of my eyes, I tried to make out what fresh Hell was waiting for me at the end of the hall. My ghosts in tow, my torment ahead. The sound of Cheryl's death rattle provided an ambience to the pounding of my heart and the timbre of dad's boots. I could see it now: Brianna's clothes–in a pile on the floor. The innocence that I stole, stacked in a heap to remind me of the pain that I caused. *Me, Pastor Joel.*

My body writhed and bubbled. I wailed. It started in my extremities and made its way to my groin. My testicles expanded and contracted like they were breathing. My penis was swollen, expanding, red and leaking discharge. I wept as I pulled myself across the floor and into the bathroom. I managed to switch the light on, hoping it would scare away the spirits on my tail.

One look at my reflection, and I was no longer Pastor Joel. I was contorting into a mound of flesh. I was bubbling like pizza dough, rounded and pulsating in an oven. The pressure around my midsection was too much to bear. I needed relief. I pulled and tugged. I masturbated. I screamed from the pain, like I was slowly morphing into a festering, infected wound from the inside out.

"God," I whimpered. I pulled the hair shears from the drawer and grazed the blade across my flesh. I could no longer see or feel myself. Only the pressure within, like I was about to burst at the seams. I laid the blade across the base of my member and swiftly fingered the shears shut. The sound of the metal scraping against itself sounded like pulling a sword from the stone. I saw my meat fall to the floor with a wet flop, followed by hot liquid cascading down my leg. Shades of red blood and yellow pus gushed from my pubis. I looked down and shrieked and then laughed.

I cried, "What is happening to me?"

The Devil's disembodied voice echoed in my head now. "You are Pastor Joel, and you always will be."

I turned around and slipped in the fluids exploding from my body. My ghosts stayed close by, watchful, and I wished to return to my table to negotiate with The Devil. "Please," I begged. But my pleas were met with silence.

My pores began to leak from my face and my arms. I crawled back towards the kitchen. The Devil had left me alone with my ghosts. A poor sinner, haunted, with no one to pray to anymore.

I pulled up a chair at the kitchen table, wearing an alien body, dickless and dripping with my sins.

My world was dark. My ghosts lingered just beyond the kitchen where I'd had a meal of unearthly delights with the Prince of Darkness. Now, the light on my walls wasn't sunlight—they were dancing red and blue. Sirens.

The police had arrived.

I turned my head back to the kitchen table where my pistol waited patiently for me to accept accountability for the first time in my life. And, for the first time in my life, I understood God’s absence. It is finished. 

  
\*\*This was my first ever short story. I hope you enjoyed it\*\*
