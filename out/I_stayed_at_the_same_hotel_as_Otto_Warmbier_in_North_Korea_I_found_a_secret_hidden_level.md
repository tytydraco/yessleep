The North Korean song started playing over the loudspeakers, bouncing off the marble hallways. It sounded slow and eerie, like a whale call mixed with jarring notes. Our minder, Mr. Li, nodded as he drunkenly clapped his hands in time with the dystopian music.  
  
“Beautiful, hmm?” he asked me and Erin with only a small trace of a North Korean accent. But he spoke with a pronounced British accent. I found this a little odd, until I realized many of the North Korean elites learned English through British teachers and boarding schools. I looked over at my girlfriend, shrugging. “OK, until tomorrow. Do not leave the building without me. Goodnight, Erin. Jason.” He gave us a stern look and a drunken nod. We had all gone out eating, drinking and singing karaoke as part of the tour, though Mr. Li had drank far more than me or Erin.  
  
“OK, goodnight, Mr. Li,” Erin said as he took off down the ornate hall, smoking an American cigarette I had given him. When Mr. Li had received it, he acted as if it were manna from Heaven. His black suit swished around his body as he turned a corner and disappeared.  
  
“Jesus, that music would drive me crazy after a few days,” I said as soon as he was gone. “Does it ever shut off?” Erin’s pretty blue eyes glanced sourly up at the speaker.  
  
“Yeah, Mr. Li says it plays randomly throughout the day,” she said, checking her watch. “It’s only 8 PM. We have plenty of time to explore this hotel and maybe meet some other people.” I felt excited by the prospect. But I didn’t see or hear anybody. This hotel was massive, over 1,000 rooms. It was the same place Otto Warmbier stayed before his arrest, torture and death: the Yanggakdo International Hotel. I made a mental note to not take any posters off the walls.  
  
This wasn’t a hotel like most rural people might think of one. It was a skyscraper, nearly fifty stories high. The exterior gleamed a bluish-gray color like a darkening azure sky. The countless windows were all meticulously cleaned; in fact, the entire outside of the building looked spotless. This hotel could have been at home in Manhattan- except for the fact that it was nearly empty.  
  
“This place is deserted,” I said, my voice echoing down the halls as we started walking in random directions. The marble tiling formed beautiful patterns under our feet. Elegant carpets ran through the center of the halls. Our room was on the seventh floor. Erin started heading toward the elevator, but I pulled her back.   
  
“What?” she asked.  
  
“They have rolling black-outs here,” I said, wanting to avoid potentially getting trapped in a North Korean elevator at all costs. Many North Koreans followed the same policy by always taking the stairs, even when they lived on the tenth or eleventh floor.  
  
“We’re in the capital city!” she protested. “You think Pyongyang is going to cut off all the electricity?” I nodded.   
  
“Even in Pyongyang, they do not have nearly enough electricity or oil. Though, in comparison, the people living here are extremely lucky. In some rural areas of North Korea, there is no electricity at all, as if they got stuck in the Middle Ages. The farmers there still plow with oxen and lay seeds by hand.”  
  
“I’m taking the elevator,” she said stubbornly, smoothing a lock of dirty-blonde hair behind her ear. I sighed as she got in. I walked in behind her. “This is so cool,” she giggled, looking at the numbers. I peered at them, seeing the dozens of buttons from the Ground Floor to the 47th floor. But after a few moments, I noticed one number missing. And it wasn’t floor 13, either.  
  
“Where’s the fifth floor?” I asked, frowning. The elevator doors remained open as we stood there, deciding. Erin squinted her eyes as if she were looking at an optical illusion. But the strange omission remained. The button for floor number 6 was directly above floor number 4.  
  
“A mystery,” Erin murmured excitedly as she pressed the button for 4. “We’ll go check out the stairs and see what the deal is with the missing fifth floor. Maybe they just have a superstition about the number 5 and the 6th floor is actually the 5th floor. Who knows? This is a strange place, after all.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
The elevator dinged as the door opened onto a spotlessly clean, totally empty fourth floor. I knew that Erin and I weren’t the only two tourists here in this hotel. We had come on a tour with a dozen other people, mostly curious Europeans and Russians. But the hotel was so massive that I hadn’t even heard the distant chattering of French or German echoing down any of the hallways. It was possible everyone was passed out drunk in their rooms, scattered all over the building.  
  
“The stairs are over here,” Erin said, pointing up to the stairwell. We walked up to the fifth floor, pulling the door open and looking down the hallway.  
  
It looked much darker and spookier than the other hallways. The elevator doors here were fused shut. The car position indicator and exterior buttons all looked dark. But why? I couldn’t figure it out.  
  
The fluorescent lights above us flickered and made soft, rhythmic tinking sounds. Our dull footsteps on the carpeted floor were the only sounds I noticed besides the light and my racing heart. There was an old smell on this level I hadn’t noticed in the rest of the hotel, like a dusty mansion sealed away from the world for a century. Erin wrinkled her nose.  
  
“Is this just an abandoned floor?” Erin asked, sounding disappointed. “If it is, that’s a major let-down. I was hoping we’d find top-secret government labs or child slaves or…” Her voice trailed off. We had gone most of the way down the hallway, seeing another hallway intersecting it at 90 degrees.   
  
“I think we should head back,” I said, feeling anxious. A warm, sulfurous breeze blew through the abandoned floor as if someone had opened a door to a volcano. One of the doorknobs up ahead clicked and jiggled. It turned slowly. With a creaking of rusted hinges, it languidedly swung open. As a breeze blew from the room, a smell like roadkill and rotten tomatoes emanated across the hall.  
  
I instinctively put my arm in front of Erin’s chest, stopping us both in our tracks. I watched the shadowy threshold with anticipation. I expected some minder from the North Korean government to come waltzing out, yelling at us in broken English or threatening to send us to a concentration camp. But nothing happened. Erin and I stood there, waiting. The dark room stayed silent and dead.  
  
“I’m officially creeped out now,” Erin whispered, glancing back the way we had come. “Let’s get the hell…” But that was all she got to say before a wailing cacophony exploded from the dark room. I backpedaled away from the threshold, which was only twenty feet away. We didn’t have much of a head start. The cry went on far longer and louder than any human scream. It sounded deep, almost demonic, the roaring of a truly disturbed creature. Then it abruptly cut off. The silence felt unnatural and oppressive in the aftermath.  
  
“Run,” I whispered as my heart raced and sweat covered my face. But, for a few moments, I couldn’t tear my eyes away, and neither could Erin. So when some monstrous man in a gas mask and a leather butcher’s apron slunk out of the shadows, we saw him at once.  
  
He towered over us, his head nearly scraping the door. His bulging, muscular arms and legs had many deep slashes criss-crossing the flesh. The skin tore on many of the slices on his legs as he walked like mouths opening and closing. Yet only black blood the consistency of maple syrup trickled down from the wounds.  
  
To my horror, I realized the gas mask was nailed into his skull. The heads stuck out like the quills of a porcupine from his forehead and cheeks. All the visible portions of his scalp thrummed with larvae. A writhing sheet of pale maggots squirmed incessantly. As he walked, some would fall onto the ground, quickly curling and twisting their tiny bodies in protest. Black rubber gloves covered his hands and arms up to his elbows. He wore a gigantic pair of blood-covered boots that were falling apart at the soles. His clothes were shredded and torn to the point that parts of his gore-soaked pants dragged behind him in tatters.  
  
I noticed this all within a fraction of a second. The adrenaline spike seemed to slow down time, and I was able to take in more details in a single glance than I ever had before.   
  
Erin and I turned. We ran for our lives back down the hallway. The heavy, metal door to the stairwell loomed ahead, only a few feet away. But the crashing, thudding footsteps of the abomination in the gas mask and leather apron sounded right behind us. I could feel the floor vibrating with every lunging step that the creature took. I grabbed the cold door handle and ripped at it with all of my strength. But the door didn’t open. It stayed locked.  
  
“Fuck!” I screamed. Erin’s eyes widened in horror and fear. I spun around, putting my back to the wall. The man in the gas mask was only a few steps away. In his right hand, I saw a long, curving machete covered in gore. The machete came down in a blur. I ducked, falling to the floor and crawling on all fours to the side. The metal door to the stairway rang in a dissonant clang as the machete’s blade smashed into it, sounding as if someone had struck a broken bell with a sledgehammer.  
  
I got to my feet, seeing the empty, round eyes of the gas mask turn towards Erin. The creature’s giant arm came up again, the machete raised high for the killing blow as it stared coldly down at her. Erin stood as stock-still as a statue.  
  
I jumped to my feet, lunging towards the giant abomination’s arm. I grabbed it, using the weight of my body to push him forward. But the machete was already coming down. It seemed to move in slow motion as it sank into Erin’s left shoulder, sending up a spatter of blood that soaked the wall in chaotic droplets. The machete stayed stuck in the bone. The creature roared with anger, ripping at it with both of his scarred, bloody hands. The machete came out with a spray of blood. Erin collapsed to the ground.  
  
I jumped on the abomation’s back and grabbed his gas mask, pulling against it with all of my strength. He gave a roar of rage as the nails driven into his skull slowly ripped out. He dropped the machete with a resounding crash, beginning to spin in chaotic circles as I clung tightly to his back.   
  
“Erin, grab the machete!” I screamed as the creature attempted to squash me between the wall and his body. Wincing and bleeding heavily, she leaned down, picking up the machete with her good hand. She raised it up above her head. As the creature spun to face her, she brought it down in a blur, jamming it through the eyehole of his gas mask. With a spurt of black blood and the cracking of safety glass, he started to collapse. I jumped off as his giant body wavered and then fell.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Erin and I went to investigate the room the creature had come out of. We found a den of nightmares. Countless bodies had been butchered, hung from the ceiling and prepared for eating. They were attached to meat hooks, their chests sliced wide open in the same way a hunter might butcher a deer. I saw many children among the victims. The smell inside the room was foul, like rotting bananas and rancid meat. But worst of all, portions of the meat had been packaged for sale in cardboard and wrapped in plastic. In North Korean writing, the containers said: “100% natural pork. Grown and butchered in Kaesong”.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Mr. Li ended up running through the door a few minutes later. Apparently, someone had noticed we were gone and then heard the sounds of screaming and fighting echoing through the stairwell. Thankfully, they had gone to get help. But the North Koreans insisted that we leave the country immediately, after Erin was seen by a doctor. Of course, the hospital where she went had no medical supplies or electricity, so it wasn’t of much help. They bandaged her arm and told her the bone was cracked and chipped. We would have to wait to get back to the Western world to get her the medical attention she needed, however.  
  
I will never go back to North Korea again after that. I don’t know if the government was working with that thing to serve human meat to its starving citizens- and truthfully, I don’t want to find out.
