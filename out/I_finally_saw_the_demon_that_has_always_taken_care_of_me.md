The loneliness was a part of me, even when I was surrounded by people who wanted to know me or be close to me. I knew how to smile and be nice, but I didn’t know how to follow conversations or show real interest in things I didn’t care about — worldliness. I was exactly at that point where people would think I was cool without actually knowing me, where I looked pleasant without truly engaging.

I had gone a couple of times to the movies or a bar because I knew I’d sometimes have to give in, just enough to blend in and be left alone when I wanted. Yet I still preferred going alone to art galleries, movie fests, symphonic concerts, to doodle while sitting in a tiny café, or simply to walk.

It had been a long time since I had given up the idea of exchanging hearts and souls… because something I learned is that in this overly human world, no one listens. Absolutely no one. They only hear what they want to hear.

If you’re into small talk, they think you want to sleep with them.
If you’re into parties and drinking, that you might be a good self-destructive buddy.
If you keep to yourself, you’re either arrogant or insecure.
If you laugh a lot, you’re silly.
If you’re too deep, you’re too intense — you don’t belong wherever the rest are.
If you’re too serious, they might actually learn something from you, but that doesn’t mean they’ll enjoy your company… and so on. There’s always a “but.”

Yet if you don’t try to fit in, even a little, the feeling that you might lean on someone also vanishes. That, too, might be an illusion — but we all like to think that somebody will go to our funeral. If I couldn’t sort out my life, I’d like to think at least a handful of people cared enough to say “goodbye.”

But in those days, I felt that if a lightning bolt struck me, my only companions at my funeral would be the ghosts that already lurked in the parlor. And nothing could assure me that those ghosts would be good company for all eternity. What if they were as dull as humans?

I constantly felt that a part of me was missing — that I couldn’t find what I was looking for, without even knowing what it was. The grief for something I had never lost had already become a part of me, making me wander through the world, worn out by how aloof people could be.

What if dullness was the norm, and I was the lost one — in a world I could not understand at all? What if I was supposed to be born in another kind of realm and was just the victim of some cosmic mistake? Or what if I was simply and plainly crazy?

I just wanted to know — to find someone who could understand the deepest layers of feeling and perception the way I did. Someone to whom I could speak of the connections built between our atoms millions of years ago, and how we’re all part of the same living system — meaning there’s much more to existence than working and paying bills.

I didn’t care about a football team or the new song everyone danced to. I didn’t care whether someone’s background was physics or literature, or if they were raw vegans or had a taste for human blood. I didn’t care about a past full of bliss, or if someone had just gotten out of jail. All I yearned for was a connection — a connection that transcended time and space.

After all, time was possibly just a human construct.

I constantly pictured myself as a spectator locked in a tower, watching everything that happened around me from afar. The few times I tried to jump into the action — deciding to go out — instead of blending into the crowds and following their rhythm, I’d fall into the lake surrounding the tower, infested by flesh-eating crocodiles and other mortal, soulless creatures.

Each time I fell, I became more reluctant to blend in. And despite trying to avoid it, sometimes the tower turned to fog or melted little by little, forcing me to swim in those icy waters with all kinds of monsters. And if I survived, I would wander among soul- and heart-eating people who might look completely innocent to each other, but who longed to devour agonizing and lost souls — like mine. Starved for hearts in pain and torment, and for those very few who dared to be themselves.

Each time I returned to seek refuge in the tower, I tried to make it higher and stronger, licking my wounds like an abandoned dog, only praying that this time it wouldn’t dissolve or turn to dust. The tower grew stronger, taller, colder… and I became a better spectator of the show.

Each time it shook, I built more bricks around it, releasing more deadly creatures into the water to remind myself I shouldn’t even try — that I should cling to its beams with all my remaining strength. But the mind is weak, and the heart is a bad influence — quite stubborn at times.

Someone down there had a key in his hand… and I had to see where that key would take me. So, like an idiot, I went down again.

We walked by cliffs, crossed hanging bridges, sailed through dangerous waters, avoided erupting volcanoes, and jumped over quicksands. We laughed about dullness, emptiness, and routine. We saw powerless and broken souls, but I clung to his warm and protective gaze.

He stretched out his hand to take mine, and although I was hesitant, I finally reached out. His touch was warm and gentle. I felt a kind of serenity flow through my veins, and a soft, smooth tranquility settle in my heart.

He led me through murk and shadows, but I wasn’t afraid. Through fog and darkness, between tall, menacing trees and shape-shifting shadows with eerie sounds coming from every direction — until we passed through a thick mist and reached, at the end of the path, an entrance to a spiral staircase going down.

The gentle warmth of his hand and a smile that could wake the dead persuaded me to continue. As we advanced, the stairs led us to a very old and secret passage with a door at the end. It seemed frozen, but he gave me a tender smile to remind me that even if time no longer existed, he and I were indeed there.

The key was shiny as the moon and beautiful as the stars — almost as beautiful as the door that awaited us. I couldn’t even begin to imagine what I would find behind it. I pictured flowing colors, a warm rain of sparkles, and the constant feeling of oppression leaving my chest.

He placed the key in my hand and held it with his own. I was shaking… or so I thought. The ground around us, the passage, the cave, the door — everything was trembling. Everything began to blur while Drewan searched for my eyes, confused.

A chill ran down my spine to the tip of every hair, and I felt needles piercing me from the inside out — through my ears, tongue, and eyes. I heard Vary’s voice as I screamed in pain, trying to hold onto Drewan’s hand… but it was useless. His hand was turning to smoke, just like everything else.

I opened my eyes in anguish and terror to find myself between soft covers and pillows that somehow felt colder than the lake surrounding the tower — and just as melancholic. Vary’s voice still echoed as it had in the dream. I felt a knot in my throat that still held the soreness of the needles, and with tears streaming down my face, I sat up in desperate despair.

All I could think about was Drewan — and how he was gone.

Vary was in front of me, standing, facing the bed, with his ice-cold gray eyes and long, shiny hair. Tall and statuesque. He seemed upset, as if he had just cried and was trying to hide it. He reminded me of The Fallen Angel by Alexandre Cabanel.

It was the first time he was truly in front of me — not on the other side of the mirror, not as a shadow, not as a note I’d randomly find, not a soft whisper in my ear, not a misty shape. He was there — cold, upset, bitter.

I wasn’t afraid of him, but I was terrified of what he could have done. If a demon could pant, he surely looked like that.

Without daring to speak, I asked everything I wanted to know with my eyes. He knew.

“I couldn’t allow him to hurt you.”

His voice resonated like in my dream, pressing on my chest, making me feel uneasy and frustrated. I could hear a million echoes of the same sentence, each one stabbing deeper than the last. He began to fade, dissolving like in a movie.

“What about Drewan?” I shouted while I could still see Vary’s eyes. I was terrified of his voice’s effect, but I had to know.

“You don’t have to worry about him anymore,” he replied as his eyes vanished into thin air.

“He didn’t want to hurt me!”

“That’s a risk I’m not willing to take.”

And with that, there was no trace of him — not in the room, nor anywhere else.

I gasped, overwhelmed, fighting the numbness in my palms and lips. I jumped to grab my phone, desperate, hoping all of this was just a bad dream. But nothing. No trace of Drewan. No messages, no calls, no pictures, no name to find online — as if he had never existed. Or as if he had never existed in my life.

I pictured him holding someone else’s hand with the key, opening that door — in another universe, where I never existed. I even hit my head, cursing in denial. But it all ended in bitter resignation after a while.

I slowly sank between the covers, holding my pillow with desolation and helplessness, exhausted and broken, weeping the most bitter tears that had ever left my eyes — feeling as if they would never stop...
