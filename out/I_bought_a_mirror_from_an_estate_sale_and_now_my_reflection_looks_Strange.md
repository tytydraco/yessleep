**ESTATE SALE**  
**Saturday, June 17th**  
**9 AM - 6 PM**  
**Everything must go!**  
  
The second my eyes read over the post and saw the estate, I knew I couldn’t pass this one up. Money had been tight as of late, but this place looked like a gold mine! It appeared to have lots of nice pieces and plenty of people were interested. The only problem? I had to be at work in an hour. Sighing, I closed my laptop and grabbed my uniform from the dryer. Despite drying it two times, it still felt damp. These apartment washers and dryers sucked. My day went by fairly quickly. I watched the hours tick by on the clock and the closer it got to six, the more my hope waned. At about 5:45 PM, my boss finally let me leave.   
  
Whipping out my phone, I quickly tapped the address into my Google maps and sped over as fast as I could. Pulling up to the house, I threw my car in park and once again sighed when I realized I was too late. A woman in a pale, blue dress was locking up and walking down the front steps. Resting my head on the steering wheel, I looked down at the floor mats and closed my eyes. There was a specific art piece in there that I wanted to buy. My friend’s Birthday was coming up, and I knew she would have loved it.  
  
The *tap, tap, tapping* on my window is what caused me to jerk to attention. Startled, I yelped before realizing it was the woman. Rolling down my window, I gazed up at her sheepishly before saying, “You scared me there!” Shifting in my seat I glanced back behind her at the house one last time and said, “I was just leaving-”  
  
“Come inside!” she said, her voice cutting me off.  
  
“Are you sure?” I questioned. “I’d really hate to keep you.”  
  
“Of course! We’re pretty wiped out, but there are a couple of things left. Come take a quick look.” Her smile was genuine. Long, wispy strands of blonde hair billowed in the wind as she turned and trotted back up the stairs to unlock the door to the house.  
  
“Thank you!” I called after her. Slamming my car door shut, I sauntered up the same steps two at a time, excitement bubbling within me. Even if I couldn’t find what I was looking for, there was still something strangely exciting about looking in someone else’s house. Something slightly… Intimate about pilfering through others belongings. The second I stepped in, I was greeted with a grand staircase and a cascading chandelier. These people clearly came from money…  
  
“Hey, um… I hate to bother, but I was actually looking for something specific.” My voice seemed to echo in the large foyer. The clicking of her heels on the marble flooring had the same effect.  
  
“What is it that you’re looking for exactly?” Spinning on her heel, she turned to face me. Despite her welcoming me in, there was almost an urgency in her steps.  
  
“A painting. The one with the-” I started.  
  
“I’m afraid all of the paintings have either been spoken for or sold.” She paused a moment before speaking again. “I do have something I’ve been trying to get rid of all day though.” Hooking a finger in my direction, she beckoned me to follow her.  
  
With quick strides, she made her way up the staircase and stopped at the very top. There was a door straight ahead that was slightly cracked. Pushing it open, she nodded towards it. “It’s just in here.”  
  
Alarm bells went off in my head. Something about this all just felt… Weird. Brushing it off, I followed her into the room. It was completely empty except for one thing: A mirror. A very large mirror. Walking over towards it, I noticed her body language sort of… shift? She seemed *very* anxious. The second I stood in front of it, a strange chill seemed to settle over the room, but the mirror itself was mesmerizingly beautiful. The framing was a mix between gold and bronze, and it looked to be very old.  
  
“What do you think of it?” She asked, eyeing me a bit expectantly.  
  
“It’s stunning! This looks like it’s completely out of my price range though.” Embarrassment burned at my cheeks. I barely made enough to make ends meet, living paycheck to paycheck.  
  
“Take it.” She urged. “I don’t even want anything for it.”  
  
“Really? Are you sure?” My hand reached out to trace the craftsmanship of the frame. The woodwork was so ornate. It was like nothing I’d ever seen before. This had to have been worth way more money than I’d make in almost a year. “Let me at least give you something for it.”   
  
My fingertips brushed over the curves and grooves of the wood one last time before I yanked my hand back with a quiet hiss. A splinter stared back at me menacingly as a small rivulet of blood seeped from the tip of my pointer finger. Gingerly, I plucked it free and shoved the finger into my mouth to stop the bleeding. The second I glanced up to face the woman though, I couldn’t help but to see the smallest inkling of fear flicker over her features before her perfectly poised facade was back in place.  
  
“Please! It’s all yours. Especially since the frame of it gave you such a nasty splinter. Gifting it to you is the least I can do.” She smiled at me genuinely as she gestured to the mirror. “This old thing isn’t of any use to me anyways!”  
  
I didn’t think much of it at the time, but it almost seemed as if she was begging me to take it rather than offering it to me. Hindsight is 20/20 though… And now, I wish that I’d never even stepped foot into that house.  
  
“Well,” I started a bit shyly. “I don’t think I’m going to be able to fit it into my car-”  
  
“I’ll have it delivered!” She interrupted, a smile painted onto her face as she wrung her hands together almost excitedly.  
  
“Oh, I… I really couldn’t ask you-”  
  
“I insist!”  
  
At this point, I just felt awkward turning her down since she was going to all this trouble. I watched as she reached out her hand to confirm the deal, but I couldn't help but look at it a moment and hesitate. Only a few seconds later, I reached out my own hand and shook hers with a bit of an apprehensive smile.   
  
“Deal.”  
  
The painting arrived surprisingly fast. I went home that night and received it the next afternoon. I had the weekend off, so that gave me plenty of time to try and find a suitable place for the mirror in my small apartment. No matter where I tried to put it though, it simply didn’t look right. It deserved to be hung somewhere it could be admired. Somewhere like the house I took it from. My place wasn’t nearly grand enough for something so beautiful. Finally giving up on where to put it, I laid it up against the wall opposite of my couch in the living room. Most people might have a T.V there, but I was too poor to even afford that at the moment. Some part of me wondered if I sold the mirror, how much I might get off of it? It looked like it had to be worth something.  
  
Walking over to give it a closer look, I noticed a splotch of red near the bottom of it. Running to the kitchen I dampened a small towel with some water before going back over to the mirror. It must have been from the day before. I was hoping my blood hadn’t seeped into the wood enough that I couldn’t get out the stain. As I ran the cloth over that area of the mirror though, I couldn’t help but wonder how I’d gotten that splinter and cut my finger in the first place? Up close, the wood seemed awfully smooth. There weren’t any imperfections that I could see anyways. Brushing it off, I lifted the cloth and sighed when I realized that I’d attempted to remove the stain a bit too late. Throwing the cloth aside, I sat down in front of the mirror and gazed at it for a moment before I noticed something peculiar. Something in the corner of the room almost seemed to be moving in the reflection?  
  
Crawling over a little closer, my eyes were so focused on what was moving in the reflection that I didn’t even notice my own staring back at me. Gasping, I scuttered backwards. It was me… But it wasn’t? Then, in a flash of remembrance, I looked behind me to see if I could see anything moving. Nothing… Everything was deathly still. My reflection almost seemed to be… Studying me. Like she was just as confused as I was. Slowly, I stood and watched as she did the same. Her face, although similar to mine, was slightly… Blurred? Where there were supposed to be eyes, all I could see was a sort of haze. Drifting closer to the mirror, I couldn’t help but feel a mixture of emotions. Fear begged me to stay away, but something stronger, something indescribable called me forward.  
  
Reaching forward, my outstretched hand neared the mirror dangerously close. It was almost as if there was a sort of magnetic pull, an electricity that danced between my fingertips and the reflection before me. And that’s when I felt it, an indescribable dread. At this point something in me clicked. I tried to pry my fingers away, but they were so close to touching the mirror… Just a hair away. Sweat beaded at my brow as I tried to break the hold that this thing had on me. But it was like the harder I tried, the worse I felt. And the moment I thought I just might be able to break free was the exact moment that my reflection reached ***through*** the mirror and grasped my fingertips within its own.  
  
*“Let me in.”* It whispered. *“You called out to me.”*  
  
The words swirled around the room so loudly that it was almost painful to listen to, the whispers sort of echoing all around me and bouncing off of the walls as if we were in a large warehouse or something. Looking down at our intertwined fingers, I watched in complete and utter horror as blood dripped from my nose and onto our hands.  
  
*“And now I have answered… I am you, and you are me.”* Her lips now appeared to be a blur as she whispered her next words like a sort of chant, over and over. *“What you wish for is what you see. I am you and you are me.”*  
  
The last thing I remember before I passed out was the feeling of the mirror rippling across my skin almost like water would over riverstones, smooth and cool. When I finally came to, I awoke with a start. The memories from before came rushing back, and within seconds I was sitting up and staring down at my hands, I breathed a sigh of relief when I noticed that neither of them were covered in blood. Apprehensively, I glanced up at the mirror. My shoulders sagged and my breathing leveled out when everything seemed normal. That was all just a strange dream… Right? Glancing at it one more time, I opted to just throw a blanket over it. This thing still gave me the creeps and I was determined to get rid of it as quickly as possible. So, I did the only thing that made sense. I decided to just have a little sale of my own. Weeks passed and I had many interested buyers, but the second they laid eyes on it, it was like they were… Disappointed? Some were even rude enough to comment that it was a piece of junk? I was more confused by that statement than anything. This thing was clearly worth more than I’d even listed it for.  
  
That was until Geneveive. I still remember the way she admired it much like I did. I silently begged her to take this thing off my hands. Ever since that strange dream I had, things just hadn’t felt the same.  
  
“I’ll take it!” She chirped, her lips turning up into a smile. “How much do you want for it?”  
  
While I thought this over, I wrestled between charging her a small amount and just giving it away. I could really use the money, but at the same time-  
  
“Ouch!”  
  
My thoughts were quickly interrupted when I noticed her pull a splinter from her fingertip and then shove the blood stained finger into her mouth.  
  
“Silly thing gave me a little splinter! Cut my finger on the frame I guess!”  
  
Dread filled me as a memory resurfaced. I, too, cut my finger on the frame… Perhaps the mirror had chosen me in some strange way? And now… It had chosen her. But for what? Deciding not to ponder on it any further, I took this as my chance to rid myself of it.  
  
“It’s all yours! I just need someone to take it off my hands!” My voice trembled slightly.  
  
“Oh, are you sure? I-”  
  
“Nope, it’s all yours!” I interrupted, trying my best to paste a smile of my own on my face.  
  
Genevieve hauled the mirror off the same day. Luckily her boyfriend had a truck. The second it left my apartment, I breathed a sigh of relief. I still can’t make sense of why the mirror chooses some people over others, or why it requires a drop of blood from its hosts. I did figure out one thing though: The mirror grants wishes. *“What you* ***wish*** *for is what you* ***see***. *I am you and you are me.”* And, because of that, I will offer you a word of caution... **Do not be fooled**. The price you'll pay for that wish is far more expensive than you even realize. And it can only be redeemed... **On the other side of the mirror.** So, if you decide to heed my warning, remember one thing for certain: If you buy a mirror from an estate sale, and your reflection looks strange… **Get rid of it immediately.**
