Rain splattered against the window,  each drop a faint echo in my dimly lit office.  I stared at the faded photographs spread out before me,  my fingers tracing the edges worn from years of handling.  A crime scene,  forever etched in time; a face,  once so familiar,  now a stranger’s.  My eyes lingered on the details; the knife,  the farm,  the body.  I muttered the witness’s words before I read them,  “I didn’t see anything; when I heard the scream,  I ran to the barn.  ” I could still hear the distant cry of sirens,  feel the chill of that fateful night,  the weight of the soaked clothes.  My gaze shifted to the report,  my report,  the pages covered with scribbled notes and diagrams.   
I heard hard knocks on the wooden door from my office.  I hastily pushed back the documents inside the box near my desk.  I hit the bottle of whiskey,  the sweet taste lingering on my lips as I took a swig and placed it down on the piles of unpaid bills,  making sure the label faced down.  The bottle was empty now.  The commissioner entered through the door.  Tall and slender,  his dark complexion etched with lines that only years of hardship could bring,  he moved with an air of authority.  In one hand he clutched a black umbrella,  and in the other a file.  I rose to my feet and offered him a seat.   
“I don’t need it.  I won’t be long.  Still working with paranormal? ”  
“I already explained to you there is no such…”  
He cut me off.  “Don’t give me that crap!  When a woman is found tied up naked on the floor with blood on the carpet drawing some satanic ritual,  and the next day,  the mayor dies,  I call it supernatural! ”  
“Sir,  there is no evidence…” I looked at his face and sighed.  “Yes,  I still work with it. ”  
“Check this case then. ” He handed me the files from under his arm.  “My men don’t want to deal with those demons. ”  
I flipped the folder and scanned through the contents.  The details were brief: a young girl went missing; the police suspected a serial killer but never caught him.  The body was later found in the forest.  I closed the file.   
“What else do you have? ”  
“We have a witness…”  
“A witness?" I scanned thought the files again. "I thought the crime was deep in the wood without anybody. Why is it not in the files? ”  
“She gave her confession three days before the crime; she says she saw it in a vision. ”  
“Where is she now? ”  
“Dead.  Overdose.  She was using a heavy dose of psychedelic drugs. ”  
I took a deep breath.  Even if I knew there was no such thing as supernatural,  I couldn’t help but resent a chill running down my spine.  This was the first case in a while.  I looked back at the empty bottle and the bills.  “I’ll take it. ”  
“You will be contacted by the next of kin.  The dead body is in the morgue; here’s the address. ”  
The rain was getting harder,  and the wind fiercer.   
“One last thing,  inspector.  For the sake of God,  take a shower. ” The commissioner walked out of the office and closed the door behind him.  I looked down at the file and reread the contents.  I didn’t see the lightning,  but I felt the thunder’s rumbling in my chest,  and for a moment,  the world turned bright white.   


&#x200B;

The sun was setting as I arrived in front of the witness’s apartment,  casting an orange glow over the buildings.  My visit to the morgue and the crime scene had taken more time than I had planned,  and I was feeling the wear of a long day.  I heard the sound of the empty bottle as I looked for my notebook.  I took it out,  filled with all the information I had collected on the case so far,  and couldn’t help but sigh as I turned to page 2.  
The old,  worn-down building seemed out of place amongst the high-rise structures surrounding it,  as if it were a relic of another time.  I climbed the rusty steps to the entrance,  where I was greeted by the strong smell of Mir.  I tried to open the door,  without surprise it was locked.  That wasn’t a problem; in my job,  you quickly learned to be resourceful.  Five minutes later I was inside the apartment.   
The room was a mess,  with papers and clothes scattered everywhere.  The only source of light came from a lamp in the corner.  It took a few moments for my eyes to adjust to the darkness.  I began searching through the drawers.  It was mostly junk until I found a book.  I found it inside a drawer under a giant mirror.  As I examined the manuscript,  I realized it was not only a book; it was a diary,  filled with notes and drawings,  all about demons.  With the book was a plastic bag full of mushrooms; the bag was open,  and some must have spilled on the page.  
My attention was caught as I saw something moving in the mirror.  I turned around,  but the room was empty.  I looked back; a shadowy figure stood behind me.  I froze in terror just for an instant before the thing vanished.  I felt the weight of the empty bottles in my pocket; they were none,  just me and my old demon.  I turned my attention back to the book and began to go through it.  She explained about how her visions were a gift.  She could communicate through space and time,  watching in the mirror.  She saw the monster.   
The book was full of drawings of different kinds of demons.  She also explained what each one does.  One particular caught my eyes.  It was the one I saw in the mirror.  The demon was a ghostly figure,  with its eyes and mouth sewn shut.  It could see and speak,  but no one could see or hear it.  No matter how much she tried,  she could not see his face; it was as if there was a blur blocking the image.  I closed the book and put it inside my pocket.  There was nothing else to find; the girl was obviously into drugs.  Another dead case.  As I prepared to leave,  I paused.  My glance went to the drug,  the mirror,  and back to the drug.  I took the drug before leaving the room,  I knew a guy who could help me with the mirror.    
  
It’s been one week since that case,  and my investigation had not come far.  My stomach grumbled as I looked up at the clock and saw it was past midnight.  The room was quiet and dark; the only sound was the rain outside.  I closed my eyes and rubbed my forehead.  Maybe a cup of coffee would help.  I rose and walked to the cupboard.  The coffee pot lied cold and empty as the sound of the bubbling water started to fill the room.  I looked at the mirror I had set in my office.  I'm still unsure why I took it back then.  I wondered if there was any truth behind the journal,  if she really had the visions.  I turned and watched the mirror.  The room was dimly lit and I could barely see myself.  I poured the coffee into a cup.  The smell filled the air and I can feel its warmth as I sipped.  I took out the journal and the bag from my desk.  I began to read the ritual instruction.  It was a summoning ritual,  one she claimed to have used to contact the demon.  It would most certainly be pointless,  she was delusional.  Yet,  if there was a chance,  this could work and I could contact the killer...  
  
My mind started to drift as the effect of the drug started to make an effect.  I looked back at the mirror and I saw it,  the shadowy figure standing behind me,  its mouth and eyes sew shut.  Once again I am paralyzed in fear,  I closed my eyes.  Suddenly a burst of cold wet wind made me open my eyes,  I was outside.  The feel of the water dripping though my hair sent me twenties years back.  The same feeling of dread.  It was a crime scene,  but there is nobody yet.  My thoughts are blurry.  I was in a tree,  I could see the room of a young girl in her late teenager,  she was sleeping peacefully.  I couldn’t help but think she looked a lot like her,  before that night.  There,  the shadowy figure appeared in the corner of my eye.  He had a knife.  He walked through the window.  I tried to stop him,  I had too.  I got up,  but lost balance.  I feel myself falling.  Everything went black.   
  
I was back in my office.  My hands were shaking.  The room was silent,  the sun high in the sky.  I hastily composed the number of the commissary.  “Did you have another case of disposition?  A young girl. ” The word was hard to come out. I feel that if i hold that conversation too long I couldn't keep the tear inside  
“Yes,  how did you know? ”  
“An intuition” I hanged up precipitately.  Maybe I was not to late this time.  My hand was still shaking as I followed the instruction once more,  stumbling on certain words.  Finally,  I managed to go through.  I saw the shadowy figure,  this time I could see his face more clearly.  The world went black again and when I opened my eyes,  I was no longer in my office.   
  
I found myself standing inside a small cabin.  The bright sun was filtering through the door.  The girl was there,  in her birth suit.  Her body was covered in cut and attached to a chair.  I looked around,  stopped on something familiar.  A small drawing I did years ago.  The low muffle sound took my attention back to the girl.  As I approached she saw me and started screaming.  I tried to reassure her.  She continued to panic so I turn around and saw the demon behind me.  He had a knife and his mouth was sewn shut.  But this time he could see me.  Before I could react,  he pushed me on the side with an incredible violence.  I felt a hard impact in my head.  And everything went black again.   
  
I woke up as the first sun ray hit the desk.  I passed out more than the last time.  My head was still hurting.  I felt like something was stuck in my throat.  As I got up,  I noticed the strange feeling and looked down.  My heart skipped a beat and a chill ran down my spine.  In front of me,  lay a bloody knife and a picture of a young girl.  It was the same girl I just saw in the vision.  She had the same cuts as the victim and her face had the same terrified expression.  On the table,  was a note,   "It is too late,  you cannot save her,  you cannot stop me.  Once again you will fail like you failed twenty years ago. "  
 I rushed to the bathroom and threw up.  My head was spinning.  I leaned over the sink and splashed cold water on my face.  My hands were shaking.  I breathe deeply to calm myself.  I went back to my office,  took out the map of the region under the half-empty bottle.  I spread it on the table as I composed the number of the police.  "I know where the girl is.  Send a team to the coordinate I'll send you. Now!" I hanged up without waiting for a reply.   
  
I couldn't stay still as I was waiting for an answer.  I heard a car parking and a loud knock on the door.  As I opened the door,  the commissioner entered and closed it.  His face was pale,  his trait heavy.  I knew what he was going to say before he opened his mouth,  "You were right,  but too late. " He threw a picture on my desk,  where the knife was hours ago.  "Not nice to see" the words stuck in the air.  "There is another girl who disappears" his eyes met mine,  his mouth open,  no sound was coming out .  I already knew what was on his mind, faster this time,  I could see it in his eyes.  I nodded.  "She looks a lot like her.  Before that night. " He left the building as the words echo in my ears.   
  
The office faded away, giving way to a hauntingly familiar scene from years past. I was back at the scene,  the rain was pouring.  I was looking at a girl,  she had a knife in her throat.  The killer was in front of her,  must not be older than ten.  He turned around,  he can see me.  For the first time in years,  I can see his face.  His mouth is sealed shut,  I screamed. 

  
My eyes open,  the world was spinning around me.   How long was I out?  My head still hurt as I emptied the last dose of drugs and started the ritual again.  "You cannot stop me, " his words echoed in my mind.  As the room goes black I can hear him,  I can hear him laughed.  "You will always be alone, " the words echo in the dark room.  As the world started to gain colors,  his words are still in my mind,  repeating again and again.   


I was at the farm,  where everything started 20 years ago.  I could see him,  he was armed,  it was raining. I looked at my wrist.  It's been 20 years,  the same date,  at the same time.  My hand was shaking as I took out my phone.  No connection,  I was alone.  I had trouble breathing,  as I looked at the scene,  the same scene I saw 20 years ago.  This time it will be different,  this time,  I was ready.   
I looked at the house,  I can see the light.  My heart was pounding,  the wind blowing.  My head was spinning,  as I saw him in the room already,  waiting for me,  laughing.  It's time,  time for revenge,  for justice,  time for the demon to pay for his crime.  I entered the house,  I'm not shaking anymore.  Here I saw him,  his eyes wide open,  his mouth is shut,  and yet he laughs.    
I looked at him, and all the fear is gone, my fist clench, my jaw tightenned, as I charged him, I punched him, again and again.I didn't feel pain, I didn't hear his cry, I couldn only feel rage, and the weight of 20 years in each punch. He was on the floor, his body cover in blood, his mouth still sealed, his eyes open.I had him under me, he couldn't move. I picked up his knife, he coudn't speak. I plunged it inside his throat, he can't look away. I kept thrusting the knife inside his throat, until his body stopt shaking, until the life faded from his eyes. I walked toward the end of the room, blood dripping from my hand, where the girl was. I was too late, once more. As the scene fades to black, I can't help but feel the tears roll on my cheek.   
I was back in my office, the room is silent and dark.   
"Why are you crying, Inspector? Because you were late again, or because this time, you can't lie to yourself?"  
A familiar voice echoed in the silence. My heart skips a beat. Slowly I turned around and froze. In the mirror, the silhouette was there, standing behind me. His mouth was still sewed and his eyes where closed. The knife still planted in his throat. It was not him, and yet, his voice, his laughter, the way he talked. He knew me, he knew me so well. I could feel his breath on my neck.  
"It was your fault, Inspector, not mine. She died because of you."  
I stumbled back, my hand find a cold metal handle. It was the knife I use to kill him once. I took it, and in a flash, the blade hit the mirror. It shatters. Shatters the illusion. His laughter echoes in the empty room, in the silent apartment, in my mind. He was not there. He was never there.  
My knees buckled and I fell. My hands were shaking. They are covered in blood as I put them to my face.  
I am alone.  
Always have been.  
And always will be.  
Alone.
