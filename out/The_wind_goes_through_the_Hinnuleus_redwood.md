Hey, I'm posting on here because I recently discovered something interesting. I am a local historian studying tribe history, French, and archaeology at Michigan. Recently, I travelled to Sault Ste. Marie went with friends for two reasons: a failed ghost haunting at Sully and a woman offering to sell historic items. There is a ton of stuff in the basement, and I dig through it with bodies in search of something intriguing. I eventually begin to touch the walls and discover a hidden chamber containing a big box. The collection includes old firearms, skinned animal fur, dried tobacco, nature drawings, coins, clothing, the Texas flag painted on a cow skull, Native American arrowheads, and a portrait of a guy marked as "Johan Blackstone."And the chest's crown jewel is Johan Blackstone's journals￼. After checking through everything, we purchased most of the items, notably the chest, which was a little costly but well worth it. During the vehicle ride back.


I went over the notes. Johan Blackstone starts talking about his early life as a farm boy. Travelled a bit from Mississippi to New England, and somehow got a job as a low man. He mostly talks about small things like nature and his drawings, spending late nights drinking with the locals of the cities he visits, and his many, many relationships. He mentioned many things, like his time hunting an animal in West Virginia,
killing livestock for fun, and calling it the tinea man. Another thing he mentions when he's talking about nearly getting shot in saying that it wasn't as bad as the time he got shot by a dead man. Many more stories similar to it.Many of these seemed like long, implausible tales to me at the time. 


However, he keep on bringing up the beast of Redwood was the first thing that scared him, and the way he handled the topic piqued my curiosity since, although he usually dismissed his experiences, he took this one very seriously. He refers to it as the "Black Hoof curse." The man has kept 56 journals with different names throughout his life, demonstrating his ability to write. However, I was lucky that it was fifth journal and being an independent book for  the tale of the Black Hoof tribe and the Hinnuleus redwoods settlement, this is the story of the beast of Redwood

Late winter in 1866 16 on Tuesday, January in the state of Indiana in a small lake town across Lake Michigan had its first execution of an Algonquian-speaking native man named Okichii  Fiddler for mass murderer.
Throughout months of the town of Hinnuleus red woods decided to execute Sir Fiddler as of his being silent throughout trial and for him being the only person discovered in the village in blood, Johan Blackstone a lawman from the state over and who tried to interview okichii throughout the trial, believing the man to be innocent with the factor of him being 68 and two winters ago having an injury of his arm making him impossible to hunt anymore. The night before the execution, Sir Blackstone came to the cell  and finally had the interview and these are his notes

Two men are standing across from each other by a table one of them is chained and the other one is chain-smoking

Blackstone: Redwood story with an older man slaughtering a whole village with his axe is cock-and-bull story 

Okichii continues being silent

Blackstone: Old man I know you’re innocent. For the sake of Christ, tell me what happened up there?

Okichii slowly looks at the window

Blackstone: fine be like an ox and be slaughtered

Okichii: You believe in the Holy Spirit

Blackstone is surprised by the old man’s response
:  yeah

Okichii: Do you have the opposite of it?

Blackstone: Yes but we don’t really call it a spirit

Okichii: But we do 

I finally cracked the hard-boiled man and he told me the story


Old man ￼ story
When my stork father was younger he went through a very long famine that consumed the land and he learned how to bury bodies very deep in the ground. I believed it was spiritual reasoning bearing and this was ingrained into his and my mind That the day he died the only thing he asked me was to take care of his childhood fishing rod and also bury him 10 feet in the ground. After the funeral, my mother told me about my dad’s experience throughout the famine and what he needed to do when he was on a hunting trip and found a group of men eating corpses down the river that used to be a fishing village called Red Tail . For the crime of taboos, my father passed judgment on the beasts. What bothered me when she told me was how she described the man being possessed ￼. 


Time goes fast one moment having my first dear hunt at the age of 17 next moment having a daughter and grandkids asking me how to skin a young buck. Of course, living next to town, the elders kept our ears to the ground with anything they did. The only connection we had was some hunters that wanted to trade and often with the woodsman who’s from both town and old tribe, That’s how I got many of my items from the town, like the spoons, shaver and holy Bible.


Two winters ago the Woodman came around and warned us what was happening in the town. A gang from Texas flooded up to Hinnuleus redwood as the law court to them and the stories about murdering, robbing, stealing and scalp-haunting but I spread. The head of the gang was some random blue-eyed kid. 

We kept our distance, but it was not long before trouble came around me and my grandkid were hunting and A couple of the men and the blue-eyed boy were also hunting. We met at the crossroads. The blue-eyed kid had an issue but didn’t say anything.  When my grandson Waban found a grazing bison. We take our time watching them and one moment peace and the next moment hot iron was launched in my arm. The gang came around and started shooting the bison missing all the shots. I looked at the boy and I saw his eyes he didn’t miss.￼￼


Throughout the year, the gang had small things but mostly tried to get themselves clean. We don’t have that much trouble with a few small issues.￼ Apparently, the kid was getting comfortable with the businessmen and the wealthy mostly doing “odd jobs” for them ￼￼ . ￼ But ￼ last fall he was caught in bed with a rich ￼dead girl. They should have killed ￼him right there.  But for some reason, they were banished with no place to go they started living in the woods ￼.There were 79 of them when they started camping couple of days, some of the lucky ones had left and the ones who got rewarded with a bullet in the head. When winter finally came, they came to us asking us to help them with food. We decided to just not to help them. 
They started shooting at the wall In rage, they didn’t really have many bullets left.￼ One point being a camp in the woods became a pathetic graveyard with shower graves. The blue-eyed kid came to our village looking so different being bones and skin. ￼Begged us for food saying that he’s the only survivor. He grabbed my arm begging me “Let me in “I looked at him and pushed him to the ground, grabbing a deer's head that I hollowed and I placed it on his head saying “You're an animal run”
￼￼

He grabbed his new mask ￼, stumbled and scraped his teeth inside the mask and licked his mouth for any flesh left ￼.
My grandson, having a much￼ bigger ￼heart than I, travelled to the camp, and he discovered that the shallow ￼ graves had been dug up ￼ and he saw the boy eating the corpses. He returned he told me everything we both decided to end the poor animals, we travelled to the camp discovering it was empty and I realised where he was.


We returned to the village the ground being red and the smell of flesh and bones was in the air and he was there. In the middle village with flames. He screamed.


Blue eye creature: Why can't I be full? Why doesn’t the fire feel warm?


The tall, starving husk of the blue-eyed boy is scraping the bodies around us 


My grandkid grabbed the axe and threw it in the back of the body 
He screamed and scattered the flash hot blood  of my grandkid Waban  was on my face and I dropped my knees and the creature looked at me


Blue-eyed creature: I don’t feel anything ￼￼

The creature stumbles towards the old man ￼

Blue eye creature: You should let me in at the beginning 
￼
￼
The blue-eyed creature turns around and he grabs a pile of meat and starts consuming ￼ 

I stood up I grabbed the axe that the creature took out of his back the moment of weakness of its scraping all the flesh and meat and I swam to the creature's head. Over and over and over it. The blood spread everywhere around me. ￼
His head had fallen off in the smoke that came out of it a horrible overpowering, foul odour


Back to my knees covered by blood I turned my head to my house burning knowing inside are what’s left of my ￼ daughter and granddaughter and￼ I screamed.  ￼
The grounds of ￼ My Home were once named Blackhoof ￼ but now like many fishing villages around us, it’s been consumed ￼
Later the Woodman and the town folk came to see the flames


Blackstone: Do you think it’s gone? 

Okichii: for now

Blackstone: Well this changes everything  I need to tell the judge ￼

Okichii: It’s too late

Blackstone: It’s not too late. You can be free.

Okichii: Where do I go? Where do I live? I have no home 

Blackstone:  Okichii 

Okichii: My grandkids are dead, my daughter’s dead

Okichii: The townsfolk's decision to accept criminals into the home and not execute them but send them to my home. They sent us to a death sentence.

￼Blackstone: This is unfair ￼ , it doesn’t need to be like this

Okichii: I accepted it when I was on my knees up to the sky

Blackstone: You deserve better you better

Okichii: Well the path is done. It’s the end. ￼

Blackstone: I hope you go up to a better place

Okichii: with the Holy Spirit?

Blackstone: Yes definitely ￼


The notes continue the execution that the day of execution Okichii  Fiddler he was in peace welcomed death. In the morning he was hanged the last words he said were” I will be with the light, my light￼ “

￼ Johann Blackstone continues writing saying that he paid to bury the old man 10 feet in black hoof land with his father's￼ fishing rod and his grandson’s￼ axe. 
￼ Final notes were ￼￼: the land of Black hoof Village ￼to the town of Hinnuleus red woods in Indiana ￼ has ￼inflicted ￼ itself with￼ ￼ a curse ￼. Many men are consumed by this ￼ land sickness throughout its history￼y ￼￼ and I will not be surprised in writing the story many more have been consumed by the second ￼ ￼.  ￼￼ ￼ I ￼￼believe that one day ￼
The grounds of Blackhoof  ￼will be at peace ￼ 
And the spilt blood will not be in vain ￼. 

As the wind will￼ return ￼ to land  by  the old man ￼
