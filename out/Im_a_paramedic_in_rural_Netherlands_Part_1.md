Hello from the writer-Sorry English isn’t my first language so the spelling and grammar won't be the best. If i put {} its so i can do a translation for what i call it in english  
  
I live in a rural area of the Netherlands and work as a paramedic in a town I won't name as I don't want people going to find them.  
  
When I was nineteen I got a job at a doctors place in my town, I dropped out of school when I was 17 because of a lack of motivation, so geting a job has been hard with my lack of motivation and education.   
  
My town has about 1400 people and one doctor. The people who visit just pass through, sometimes stopping to buy food or fill up there cars. But now they seem to stop less and less. All the locals either work in the lumbar industry and few work around the petrol station, the school but only five people including me work at the doctors. For my hole life those have been the only choices till six months ago.  
  
Six months ago this woman moved next door to me.  
  
She seemed friendly but only spoke English and as a the only english speaker i showed her around. All I knew was that she is American and lives alone. She seemed to be interested in my job and was confused about why it was so unpopulated when we live in a beautiful forest area far from a city.  
  
The first day she moved in i was outside my apartment building when i saw her so i called to her.  
  
“Hello”  
“Hi. do you know any english” she had many boxes with her, she was panting from carrying the boxes from a taxi to the door.  
“Yes, do you need help with those”   
“No i'm good do you have a key with you”  
“No”  
“Well shit”  
  
She left i didn't see her again for two days, she came back with stories of how she had to drive to Amsterdam and back to get a key. A dumb decision as the building was open and her apartment on the fifth and top floor had been left opened since the old man who used to live there died.   
  
I lived on the ground floor and would see her regularly get locked out because she would forget how the building worked so she would panic and call her friends. Soon her friends moved into the building and I stopped seeing her.  
  
The only one of her friends that i talk to was a man, his called himself Dr Danny McGran an Irishman the first interaction of ours occurred when i left to the job market. He followed me every corner i turned i could see him till from the corner of my eyes. Then a hand on my shoulder.  
“Young man, do you know where the doctors is, im a doctor who needs staff and if you help i will hire you as a paramedic.” his hand slid down my arm, i was trying to pull away from him but his grip was stronger then intimated.  
“Yes, only if you let go of me” the grip loosened but was there. I took him to the three person doctor.  
  
My favourite fact of my town is that our doctor is a triple merged person, all with different personalities and ideas. The weirdest part of it is its a thing that happened many times then normal. 14 different people have this condition two more three merged people, four two merged people. {I think its called conjoined in English, cin Nederlands and merged is what i will say}  
  
After the first few hours of panicking as Dr McGran made the Doctor hire us. That was the worst job interview but left me a job that ruined the life i had built for myself of being alone now with my job i had to work alone.  
  
My first five months were peaceful with a few calls but mostly i sat in the ambulance van and sat doing nothing for weeks till the first call about the fifth floor.  
  
‘Hello where are you and did you get something stuck in a hole in your body if so hang up”  
“No this is Maria”i could recognise the accent  
“There was… accident in my apartment, one of the occupants sliped over and hit his head.”  
“Shit is he breathing”  
“Yes just i”  
“What happened” panicking as i started the van towards the building.   
  
The lift to the fifth floor felt like it took years the numbers clicking till a ding. The doors opened to show a bloody hellish area. I could see a man in the corner, a skull being visible in from the lift doors. Blood was spilt on the walls in a pattern that repeated on all walls in the room.   
  
I just felt frozen in place but i could hear the man in the corner muttering, i dont know what he was saying, i think he was speaking spanish. My skin was crawling with what felt like bugs, i hate bugs. So i tryed to focus on the man.  
  
“Sir?” the muttering didn't stop  
“SIR!”  it just got louder, i thought somthings on my leg. I hope Spanish is correct.  
“Señor!” now i could see his eyes, bloodshot, and the muttering is just as loud as my heart and i couldn’t feel anything but the bugs on my legs.   
  
The room was turned, thats the closest description the man was turning his face was turning, I couldn’t move. I did the only thing to help me, try to step back and breathe close my eyes and breathe.  
  
Then the turning stoped, the muttering stoped.   
  
My phone was buzzing in my hands, but i dont remember holding it. I think that it was there the hole time. The man, i knew he was dead. So my phone was called by Dr McGran asking if i had seen the man. I told him that the man is dead. I didn't tell him about the rest.  
  
I don't remember the rest of that day. It was the first time id ever been to the fifth floor when the woman was living there.   
  
I went back to my apartment, i saw the woman come home, i know she called me to go to her house. I wanted to run out to her and question her, but i left it. I wish i did ask her, i should have left, i should have moved, left the building. But i didn’t.
