You've always been drawn to the dark corners of this house, bejeweled with cobweb-cloaked memories and dust that told an old story. The decrepit house always called your name, specifically the attic. As you wander inside, it yearns for you...wanting to share its secrets with you, but you keep ignoring its lustful temptations...*until one day.*

You come by to do your normal routine job, take care of my plants, watch my stuffed dogs, and protect my property while I am away. As night begins to fall upon our home, you feel that unearthing lust for the Attic once again; it is stronger than it has ever been. You carefully creep up the stairs and open the door, fearful of what's to come...but nothing happens. It's just a dusty old room filled with boxes and spiders who have become lovers. *Sigh,* a sense of relief sweeps over you.

You walk in and look around, a few bobbleheads and a few antique items here. In your search, you see your mother and father's photos, with your father's face scratched out. S*trange.* You stumble upon an old green wooden box adorned with beautiful carvings. Carefully you pick it, but to your dismay, it breaks into pieces, *which break too easily for a wooden box*, you think to yourself, *like someone set me up.* Someone did set you up, I did. On the dusty floor, you see letters...a lot of love letters. A wonderful lacy dress and black pointed stilettos that are in your size. You stumble out of the attic, trying to stay away because you just broke my treasures, but I know how you are, can't respect people's things. Oh, how I’ve watched you, my love, knowing this day would come. You never respected the weight of the past, did you? You came back, no? In those clothes, you become a ghost of my desires, hauntingly beautiful, ready for me.

You open one letter, a man expressing his love for an anonymous woman, his words dripping sweet like honey. And you did it again. You left the attic. Psh. Patience, I'll have to be patient for you to uncover my love for you. After four solid days, prancing in the lacy garment, thinking about the Attic, you came back to my love story. You begin opening my letters again. I sat behind you in delight! You were reading my love story, I used special ink and the most expensive fountain pen for this. Oh, the joy! The final letter you open has names. Jonah Wilds, *oh!,* you think to yourself, *that's the man who owned this house, but I remember him faintly, like he was connected to crime? He had a love story,* then you read the madam's name, and something hurt you, *no no no!, i-i-it can't be, that's me, my name!.* You shrieked in horror, but why, my love, aren't we meant to be? Aren't you mine?! I stood up, towering over you. *The room is shrinking! What's going on?.* I began covering you like a blanket. My fingers tugging on the straps of your garment, tracing every bony crevice your skin gripped to. *Ah! Who's touching me? I feel heavy, I feel driven, in love, seduced...a warm breath hovering over my skin. I love it...I need it ...mmmmmh.* Yes, yess, my darling, *it's not real.. Lois...snap out of it.* You gaze at the letters. *Are the letters cursed?! Ah!* I saw you run out in horror, leaving our beautiful home.

*He's dead! NO! It's not real. Lois, it's fake. IT'S FAKE! Get a grip on yourself! Lois!*

I saw you crying. Just like Jane did when I confessed to her. Jane rejected me, denied me love when I needed it the most, and since then, I felt broken inside. I later received an invitation to attend your great-grandfather's funeral. I was a young lad then, my dad knew your great grandad, and I saw your mom. A beautiful young lady, who dressed to kill, and had confidence I had never seen, but she was taken by your Father. A counterpart to a rat. Their love irritated me, disgusted me. Someone watched his every move, waited, and tricked him into driving into a ditch. He was murdered. But his killer? Innocent. That someone had a rightful cause to do so...that someone needed his other half! Unfortunately, the court didn't agree, so he was thrown into prison to rot in a stupid cage.

When he was free from prison, his lover died, but he saw her daughter...and an exact clone of her, gloriuos in her mid ages. Oh, how he rejoiced, he committed to pursue her and claim her...that someone is me, Jonah Wilds, and you are my destiny partner, Lois!

As you stumble back, horror crashing over you like icy waves, I watch your retreat with longing. You flee, leaving behind the remnants of what was meant to be our dark paradise. You couldn't believe it. Humans don't believe in this type of love, but I do. I followed you out of our field, I sat in your car, slept in your bed, watched you eat, sleep, wake up, and did it all over again. You thought you left me. You diarize it, showing ecstasy that you don't feel persuaded into a false lover. I let you have this idiotic sense of freedom for a while, and then.

I keep sending you mail, week by week, and you can't stop reading it. Do you feel it coming back? Our souls are intertwined with desire, my beautiful princess.

But don’t think you can outrun me. I’ve lived in tragedy, dead for decades, feeding off the unfulfilled desires of this house. You are tethered to me in ways you can’t begin to understand. My essence lingers within these walls, intertwining with yours. You’ll never escape me, Lois Hilton. You carry my love like a specter that haunts your every step. Stop fleeing, come back to our church, come back to our playground, to our family dear, come back to the darkness, come. Back. To. Me, or risk seeking another to fill the void I’ve carved in your heart. You’re mine now, forever bound to my heart.
