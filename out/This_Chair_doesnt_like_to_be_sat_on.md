I never wanted to see my family again after moving out. I felt like if I didn’t soon make it out of the picket fence prison my family created, it would be the beginning of a news broadcast that ends with the words “and then she used the weapon on herself.”

I finally managed to find a tiny house for rent in a rather shabby part of town. However, it was dirt cheap, which means it was perfect for me, who was dirt poor.

The place was a dump. During the open house, I was with two other groups, a couple and a small family. I saw that the two other groups went upstairs so I went spelunking in the basement. There was a single lightbulb dangling from the ceiling, straining to keep the darkness at bay. Down there was only a single small room with a washing machine, a shelf with some boxes of the previous owners, but nothing else. I heard both the couple and the family complain in hushed tones upstairs. The house was way too small to have secret conversations. I could hear them bickering about the layout, the size, the absence of light and other stuff. I had no ideas about any of that, neither did I care. I was a dumb bird in dire need of a new nest. But the layout of the house was impractical to say the least, but beggars shouldn’t be choosers. That’s not how the saying goes, but that’s how it should be. Sue me. 

I quickly outlasted the other visitors who left immediately after returning from the upper floor. I went and talked to the landlord who looked sheepishly at his last remaining survivor of this open house. It was his parents’ house, they passed away, he has no use for it, yadda yadda yadda... I want a place to stay, and you obviously want my money. Let’s not be friends. Beggars and choosers goes both ways. He seemed eager to make it work and gave me a guided tour through the house to make it more palatable.

The ground floor had a stairwell and a living room with an open kitchen. The ceiling felt too low. The windows were too small. Tiny lightbulbs were switched on during the day to illuminate the misery.

The upstairs wasn’t much better. After you went up the stairs there was a door that led to the bedroom. You enter through the narrow door and stare through the square window inside the triangle of the opposite wall. The branches of the tree in the backyard blocked out the light, which tried to get in. There was barely enough room for the single bed beneath the window. There was one dresser and a slim cupboard on each side of the door, the other walls were empty, because of their angle.

There was a narrow hallway with a bathroom: a toilet, a tub and a window. No shower, because of the wall that seemed to fall on top of your head.

Across the bedroom, on the opposite side of the house was the final room. When you just stroll through the house it lends itself to be the last room you enter. The landlord looked uneasy. I just shrugged. I opened the door and stopped in the door frame.

At first, I thought I’ve already been to this room before. There it was colder than in the rest of the house. The room itself was identical to the bedroom, but instead of the dresser, cupboard and bed this room was completely empty, except for a single chair in the middle of the room, facing me.

I don’t know how to describe it. It was just a simple, wooden chair. There was nothing special about it: no decoration, no interesting knots or wood grain. Just a plain chair. Four legs, one backrest connected to two of the legs, one seat, no armrest. It was very well made, because it looked like it was made from a single piece of wood.

But something was off. A chill went down my spine as I looked at the chair that just stood there. Like a dog staring down into the abyss of an open door. Watching. Waiting. Tense.

I overcame my hesitation and took a step inside the room. After I shot him a questioning glance, the landlord said: “This chair doesn’t like to be sat on.” I shrugged and looked around the room. Both upstairs rooms look identical, the only difference is in the bedroom you could not see the tree that is growing in the backyard.

I took one last glance at the chair as I exited the room. I’ll tell you, the chair had an ominous aura,… I know how silly this sounds. I know what you think: “It’s a chair, what’s it gonna do?!” It’s not about what it does, it’s about how it makes you feel.

In the end we both got what we came for: I got an affordable place to stay, and my dear landlord got a little money on the side. He even went lower with the rent, on the condition, that I was to keep the house tidy and to take care of the garden, which was rather small and quaint. I also should get rid of the boxes in the basement.

Maybe the landlord had pity for a damsel in distress, as he even allowed me to keep the furniture without an additional charge, which suited me, because I didn’t have any of my own. Also, furniture is expensive as heck, so I was happy about that.

Moving out, was a simple task. All I needed were two carloads of friends, as I was just moving my clothes and electronics after all. At least, this went through without a hassle. But my parents were making a huge scene. They went all the way with the cliché bombs: “Samantha, where are you going? What do you think you’re doing? You cannot leave! You’re tearing this family apart! You’re all that’s left.” But honestly, screw them.

After I moved in, I wanted a place to put my clothes for the next day, so I moved “the Chair” into my bedroom. That turned out to be a really dumb idea. After a night on the chair, my clothes always felt odd. I cannot describe it, but the texture felt off. Too damp, too dry, too drab. Whenever I wore them the next day, I felt angry, supressed, constricted, itchy … just unwell, uneasy and uncomfortable. Before you ask, no, I did not get fat. The same clothes that grinded me down one day were fine the next, when they haven’t been corrupted by the chair.

And no, I never sat on the chair in the bedroom. I brushed it off, as me needing to be getting used to living on my own. So, for the first days, in order to deal with that miserable feeling, I went home during my lunchbreak and swapped clothes into some that were in the closet. That eased the feeling of getting emotionally constricted.

That was until I hit a really busy day at work and couldn’t go home and change. It was hell. Words cannot describe how horrible I felt all day. Pulled and pushed at the same time. Constant pressure. Gripped. Breathing became taxing.

As soon as I came home, I ripped of my clothes and threw them down into the basement and slammed the door. I was drained. I just crawled into bed and slept like a baby.

That night I didn’t put any clothes on the chair and the next day I felt as if a burden has been lifted. It took me way longer than I care to admit to make the connection between the chair, the clothes and my horrible attitude. In my defence; it’s still sounds really outlandish. But finally, I realized the chair was somehow messing with my clothes. So, I banished it back to the spare room, the “chair room”.

It’s all just so dumb… I still feel silly talking about it now. But I felt better, when the chair wasn’t near me.

At the housewarming party, the house was full, which wasn’t hard considering the size of said house. Also, housewarming party makes it sound much bigger than it actually was. I had Ellen and Carrie and their boyfriends Ethan and Brad over, ordered two family pizzas for my eager moving helpers and we had a great time at the house. Both couples brought a bottle of wine as a gift. One red, and one white wine. We enjoyed the snacks, music and drinks. They were happy and/or jealous, that I found an affordable place to stay. We opened the first bottle of wine.

“Look at little Sammy, all grown up and living on her own now.”

The living kitchen became the centre of the party and one more place to sit was needed at the dining table.

The chair room came up. I had to endure the barrage of dumb comments, while Carrie went to fetch the Chair.

“What are your plans for the spare room?”

“Need a housemate?”

“A room with just a chair?! Who are you torturing in that room? “

“Silly Sammy, you torture people in the basement! That way you don’t disturb your neighbours.”

“Maybe, her sex dungeon is already in the basement.”

“Hmm…, then you have to consider where the yelling is louder”

“Why not both in the basement?”

But that was to be expected from them.

Carrie brought the Chair down. When I saw the Chair being carried into the living room, it felt like someone was gripping my guts. And giving them a good yank. With really cold hands. But I’ve seen enough horror flicks to know that you do not make a scene about such innocent things. Otherwise, you look crazy. I couldn’t afford to look crazy. “Crazy Sammy” has a horrible ring to it.

I realized I had held my breath and slowly released it from my lungs. The chair was put next to the couch, but it remained empty most of the evening. I tried to keep the dining table between me and the chair at all times. As the evening progressed and the pizza arrived the chair was moved to the dining table. It stood opposite of me. It’s blandness and blankness in stark contrast to the darkness that was pushed into the background of the living room by the brave lightbulb over the table.

The pizza wasn’t sliced so Carrie brought a pizza cutter from the kitchen. As she arrived on the table there was only one empty chair left. You can guess which one. She stood awkwardly over the chair as she opened one of the pizza boxes. One knee on the chair. Pizza cutter in hand. Her left hand pressed down on the table.

She slipped. Somehow.

The pizza cutter rolled over her fingers, over her hand, over her wrist.

Stunned silence.

Then, she bled. Badly.

After the second it took everyone to realize what happened, everybody scrambled to get help. I couldn’t move. Hypnotized by blood spurting over the dining table and seeping into the tablecloth. Slowly turning white to red.

Ellen, who is a nurse, yelled at her to raise her hand over her head. Carrie looked like she was about to puke but complied. She sat down on the Chair and raised her hand about head level. I could see the blood running down her arm and trickling off her elbow. Ellen grabbed Carries crimson hand and raised it even higher. Now, the blood ran straight down her arm and into her blouse.

Carrie said, “I want to stand up”

“No.” Ellen barked.

“I don’t feel well” Carrie tried to stand up, but Ellen pushed her down. Nurses don’t fuck around.

“You’re lightheaded, you can’t stand up.”

“I don’t want to sit”

“No.”

Carrie squirmed and shifted on the Chair, like she was sitting on hot coals. Smearing blood everywhere I could see. Tissues and towels were rushed to the table. Ellen cursed at the non-sterile options and turned to me: “Don’t you have a goddamn first-aid-kit?”

That brought me out of my stupor. I apologized and got the kit from the bathroom. As I re-entered the living room, Ellen was still fighting off good hearted attempts from the tipsy helpers.

“You don’t need to wipe it, when it’s still bleeding! Give us space”

I gave her the first aid kit, and she dressed Carries wound. “How did you fuck up so badly?!” Carries boyfriend Brad exclaimed. “I’ve never seen someone get hurt with a pizza cutter.”

Ellen’s gaze could have boiled a pot of water. Brad shut up. Ethan understood the hint, grabbed Brad, made the motion for “cigarette” and they evacuated the room, after abducting two beers from the fridge.

And to be honest, it was a prick move, to berate your girlfriend after what just happened, but I kind of get what he was getting at. Everything was a mess. The table, the floor, Carrie’s top and pants all had big fat drops of dark blood on them. The mood was gone. Party’s over. And worst of all, the pizza was ruined.

“Everything under control?” I asked. “How are you?”

Ellen nodded grimly. Carrie looked like she was about to faint. “I don’t want to sit.” she said quietly.

Ellen finally relented and let her stand up. With buckling knees Carrie heaved herself onto the chair next to her. Pale as a ghost. Then she seemed to relax.

Ellen shot her a questioning look and said “If I were you, I’d go to the hospital, you’ll need stitches. We’ll pick up the two drunkards and then I’ll drive you there, ok?”

Carrie didn’t react. Ellen turned to me.

“Samantha, do you need help with the clean up?”

“I’ll manage. Just get her to the hospital.”

I helped Ellen to get their belongings and escorted them to the door. The boys returned from their smoke. Brad kept glancing at the floor. As we wrapped Carrie in her jacket, she finally showed some flicker of life.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry” she sobbed. “I didn’t mean to… I didn’t know…”

Brad shushed her. “It’s ok. It’s okay. Next time we tell them to pre-cut the pizza.”

Ethan elbowed him into the ribs and asked me “Sammy, are you sure, you don’t need any help?”

“It’s fine. I am used to cleaning up after parties, remember?”

They made their exit and I was mentally hardening myself to clean up the crime scene.

Mother used to say, “Cleaning is much more bearable when you’ve got a slight buzz”, and she cleans every day, so she’ll know, right? So, in order to prepare for the clean-up, I emptied my glass of wine, and those of my friends which got left behind. At least it wasn’t red wine.

I gathered the cleaning supplies from the kitchen and surveyed the situation. I even did the glove-slap, thinking “Where do I get started?” It looked like I murdered someone in there. Maybe the alcohol wasn’t helping. I was feeling really tipsy at that point.

First, I threw the pizza in the trash. I am quite certain that Carrie doesn’t have AIDS or anything, but no one is eating a blood-soaked pizza. Then I clumsily picked up the tablecloth. Trying not to get too much blood on me. I had the great idea, to mop up some of the blood with the cloth. I looked around. Then I sobered instantly.

I stared at it for a good minute or two. Blood has soaked through the tablecloth and was all over the table. Then there was blood all over the floor, which was expected to be honest. But what stood out was that the Chair was spotless, despite standing in a puddle of blood. It was off-putting. Totally out of place, like a shitty photoshop job. I saw the blood running down Carrie’s elbow. There was no chance in hell, that not a single drop of blood had hit that damn Chair. It was too damn clean!

Well, there was nothing to be done. I pushed the chair out of the pool of blood. As I moved the Chair, I saw streaks of clean floor where the feet of the Chair rubbed across the blood. It was like a sponge. I was stunned. I pushed the chair over the floor a couple of times. And lo and behold! Where the feet have been, there was no blood anymore.

I looked at the Chair for a second. I was mildly disturbed, and I didn’t like this one bit. So, I put it outside of the pool of blood and cleaned the floor the old-fashioned way. I felt the glasses of wine was once again taking their toll. All I remember is, that afterwards I threw away the gloves.

The next morning, I slept in, because those glasses of wine really hit me hard. I made myself some good old-fashioned English breakfast and sat down at the freshly cleaned dining table. The cleaning process was hazy at best, but I did an OK job. Sure, a forensic team probably still would find traces of blood, but I’m no expert, ok? Also, I didn’t do no crime.

The Chair stood across from me. Squeaky clean. Facing me. Did I put it that way, yesterday? I wasn’t sure. Then I almost spit out my breakfast, and no, it wasn’t the alcohol.

The once plain, bland and boring wooden Chair now had two knots in the backrest that peeked over the tabletop at me. Like eyes. I know for a fact that those two knots weren’t there yesterday. Everyone remarked how plain the chair looked. I felt watched.

Now is the part in horror movies where the damsel in distress calls her friends all panicky and demands to know “Had the Chair always have these two knots?” and her friends never give a satisfying answer and probably think she is crazy. So, I didn’t do that. I’m not crazy, right? Crazy Sammy is still a horrible nickname, remember?

But I have to say, that eating across from this stupid Chair was really getting to me. I felt watched. Judged. Sentenced. By a Chair.

Don’t overreact, Samantha. It’s just a Chair. Nothing’s going to happen. You’re stressed because of work, on edge because you’re living alone and probably still drunk because you almost drank a whole bottle of wine on your own. I felt its wooden glare boring into my skull. A nasty headache developed, which I also partly attributed to the alcohol. The pressure in my head. Constriction. I felt like I was wearing my clothes after they were infused by the chair.

I closed my eyes and chewed on my food. I tried to block out the staring Chair.

Memories were projected onto my closed eyelids against my will.

My sadness, as my parents always siding with my older brother.

My disgust, after what he did to me.

My hopelessness, when they didn’t believe me.

My anger, as I was accused of “rocking the boat”.  

My satisfaction, after my brother finally wrapped his car around a tree.

My insecurity, when my parents still chose to treat me as a second-class-child. Even after I was an only child. I am second place after a dead guy.

I opened my eyes. The Chair’s wooden eyes were still boring into me.

I snapped. I wanted to get rid of the Chair. Now. Put it back into the Chair Room. Away from me. I rounded the table and reached out my hand.

Shock.

I recoiled on instinct. I swear, this fucking Chair shocked me. It felt like I touched an electric fence. It was made of wood for fucks sake. I’m no physicist, but even I know enough to know, that it’s not supposed to work like that.

My gaze snapped longingly to the second housewarming gift. The still closed bottle of wine. Damn those motherly instincts. I can’t start drinking after breakfast, or I’ll end up like my mom. I let the Chair be a chair and decided that my bodily health has priority. I wanted to open it, so I needed to get rid of the bottle. I grabbed the bottle and stomped into the cellar, but gave the gave the Chair a soft kick like a petulant child.

I flicked on the light, which promptly flickered out. Pitch black darkness. Prompting me to run into some boxes of the previous owners, those that I promised to get rid of, but didn’t have the time for yet. Why do these things always happen, when you’re agitated?! Of course, I didn’t bring my phone this once, so I stomped back to the kitchen to get it and returned to the basement. I could have sworn, that the Chair’s eyes were following me.

With my phone light I managed to find a spare place for the bottle, but I had the bright idea to search for an extra lightbulb in the boxes, since I can guarantee you, that I didn’t own any of my own. I was new at this, ok? So, I grabbed two boxes at random and brought them into the living room, because I didn’t have the nerves to rummage through boxes in the dark.

I got a boxcutter, cut open the tape and emptied them out in the hallway, out of sight of that damn chair, and found random bits and pieces and a photo album. I know it was wrong, but I flipped through it. There were my landlord and his parents, but they looked somewhat younger. They seemed like a happy little family. Don’t worry, the pictures were not in black and white. That would be too cliché.

Then there was a picture of the backyard. There were four strange little tree stumps were sprouting in a square shape. The next picture showed the same place, but there was a hole, in which the four treelike stumps rose like brown monoliths. My landlord and his dad were posing next to the hole. Thumbs raised and smiling like fishermen who caught something.  In the next to last picture of that page the hole was even bigger, and the Chair stood right next to it. You could see the indentations of the Chair inside the hole where it was buried upside down. The excitement of the two men radiated through the photo. What. The. Hell.

My eyes darted to the door of the living room. As if expecting the Chair to stand in the doorframe. But of course, it wasn’t. My curiosity got the better of me, and I kept looking through the photo album.

More family photos, but they didn’t look as happy as the previous ones. The Chair was always empty. I found one picture in which my landlord’s father was sitting on the chair. Maybe it was just an unlucky photo, but he looked like he was in agony. Like he was sitting on hot coals, being dumped with buckets full of ice and being electrocuted at the same time.

I’ve had enough and closed the album. But a single photo dropped out of the book. I looked at it.

It was a blood splattered room. It looked like one of the rooms upstairs. There was blood on the bed, the wardrobe, the walls, the ceiling. Everywhere. In the middle of the room stood the pristine plain Chair. It looked like it was placed in there after whatever happened happened. But after my cleanup experience I’m not so sure. The leaves in the window were in stark contrast to the various shades of brown and red in the room.

My hand grew cold. That’s the room I’ve been sleeping in.

I grabbed all the stuff in the hallway and stormed into the living room. The Chair hadn’t moved. It’s eyes staring at me. Taunting me. I got angry and I’m ashamed to admit, that I yelled at a chair. Maybe I’m Crazy Sammy after all. I think it compelled me. But I suddenly got the urge to sit on the damn thing.

“You don’t like being sit on?! How do you like it now!” I screamed as I sat down.

Nothing happened. My anger evaporated. I leaned against the backrest. My gaze swept across the ceiling, and I fixated on the sad lonely lightbulb over the dining table. I stared into the light, and everything else dimmed.

I am in a dark place in my life. Figuratively and literally. I never felt truly loved by my family. My father was as distant and cold as the moon, while my mother was a hot mess like the sun. My brother was the lonesome planet that kept me in orbit of this fucked up constellation. After he was gone, I drifted out of this system like a satellite that got knocked off course. I am lost. Where do I belong? Where do I go? I don’t want to be alone. I’m afraid of the unknown. But becoming some kind of driftwood in the dance of attraction and repulsion between the moon and the sun isn’t what I want.

Maybe, I should leave this place and embrace the darkness in front of me. The solitude suddenly seems oddly comforting. I have no place. I never felt at home. I always wore the chains of expectation. Become someone who makes Mum and Dad proud. An impossible task.

Maybe, it’s better to feel nothing than the gnawing sense of despair and dread. Will it ever get better? I thought getting out of my parental prison would set me free. But it didn’t. I still feel like I should do more. Living on my own is not enough. What will it take?

Maybe, I should just get into my car and hit the accelerator as hard as I could. Run away. Push through the dark valley in pursuit of happiness. To find a place where I truly belong, where I can be myself. I could feel the wind combing my hair. Unburdened. Free.

Maybe, there is a tree somewhere that might end these thoughts.

I jumped out of the Chair. “What the fuck are you doing to me?!”

I kicked it over. It made a satisfying sound as it hit the wooden floor. I breathed in heavily. There was the boxcutter in my hand and a gash started at the nook of my elbow. Blood was running down my wrist. I rushed to the kitchen, where the First-Aid-Kit was and hastily dressed the wound, which fortunately wasn’t as bad as Carrie’s the day before. But still bad.

And then I did what any sane person would do. I put on fresh cleaning gloves and dragged the Chair into the backyard. The place, where they had dug up that goddamn Chair, was easy enough to find and I I dumped it there. I brought the boxes with the landlord’s stuff and sprinkled it over the chair. Finally, I drowned the whole thing in the strongest spirit I had at home and set in on fire.

My arm was throbbing as I watched the flames engulf my makeshift pyre. I took a raw sip out of the bottle. The fire cackled and I could swear, that the Chair was laughing at me. Air was howling out of the chair as the flames took it. Its eyes were watching me as they were consumed by the flames.

The smoke behaved oddly. At first, it seemed to form clumps around the Chair, like metal shavings around a magnet and then it shot skywards and formed the shape of an “X” before it completely dissipated about a meter above the pyre. At the same time, the whole thing started to burn violently, and the heat got so intense that I had to take a step back.

As all the smoke was sucked into the centre of the X, I stood there mesmerized by the display. Everything in that pyre turned to ash. The echo of the cackling laughter still rang in my ears.

After it was over, I got a shovel from the shed and buried the ashes, where they had found the thing. I spilled the last of the spirit bottle over the “grave” for good measure. When I got inside there was the bottle and a filled glass of red wine on the dining table. I don’t remember pouring it; however, I poured everything into the kitchen sink.

Brad was sent over to help with the cleanup I already did. I said “was sent” because he’d never would have gotten the idea on his own. He asked about the missing chair, and I told him I burned it. He thought that burning the thing was unnecessary and excessive, I could’ve just cleaned the chair. But oh well, Brad’s gotta to be Brad. He wouldn’t understand anyway.

While writing this down at the dining table, I often glance over the top of my laptop, expecting those wooden eyes to stare back at me or for a filled glass of wine to be there. God, I yearn for a glass of wine. Yet, I cannot shake the feeling that what I did was reckless. Maybe, I’m Crazy Sammy after all. The laughter, the smoke, the X over the pyre. I’m afraid I did something wrong, set something free. But that’s a problem for Future-Sammy.

First, I have to clean up my life, but I won’t do it like my mother.
