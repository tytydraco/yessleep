The road had not been paved for years. Only tourists passed through there, mostly young college students who were on a rural getaway to disconnect from the hectic pace of the city. Those who ended up in the hovel I called home were those who dared to stray a little from Donaldsonville hoping to find some adventure in a wilder nature, and boy, did they find it... poor bastards. At first I felt a little sorry for them. Seeing people in the prime of life with a terrible fate awaiting them certainly turned my stomach. But after years of watching them disregard my warnings and even mock me, any empathy I might have felt had vanished. It had been two days since a group of kids had stopped by. I remember they didn't put on a very good face when I told them that despite the  “Gas Station” sign, they couldn't fill up. As I used to do with everyone who passed by, I warned them not to go into the woods, because they would find something that wasn't meant to be found. They simply replied “we don't believe in the superstitions of the country's people”. I guess they found The Rusty House, or rather, The Rusty House found them. Bad luck, no one forced them to come.  



Like every night, I was sitting on the porch playing blues on my old cigar box guitar and drowning my sorrows in cans of cheap beer. That's when I heard the screams. I looked up and saw her. All of her body covered in blood and running towards me, “Dear God… There's no way to find inspiration” I thought as I put my guitar away.  The young woman came up to me crying.



“Please, you have to help me! The others are dead, I... I... God, we have to call the police!” 



“I'm afraid the police won't be able to do anything,” my words seemed to scare her.  She took a step back. “Don't worry, I'm not one of them.”



Exhausted, she dropped into one of the porch rocking chairs and put her hands on her head. She kept crying for a while. I brought her a glass of water and tried to soothe her as best I could. 



“I don't understand. What are they?” 



“I warned you, young lady. But you guys never listen. Your arrogance doesn't let you see beyond your idyllic modern city life. You are not aware that God abandoned these woods many years ago,” she looked at me, bewildered and frightened,”I'm sorry kiddo, sometimes I lose my mind. This is a quiet lifestyle, but I haven’t felt fulfilled lately. Answering your question. I have absolutely no idea what they are. It’s something beyond human comprehension. That place you escaped from, The Rusty House. Not everyone comes across it. One of you had something that attracted it and that's why it invited you in.” 



“This can't be real! It invited us in? What the fuck does that mean?” 



“I've already told you. All I know is that they're part of something bigger, or at least that's what I've always been told, although God only knows what that means.” 



“Who told you that?” 



“The ones who gave me this job. I used to live and work in the town. I didn't make much money, but at least I was doing something I liked. Every night, Thursday through Sunday you could see me perform at Old Sam's saloon. “Isaac Low Strings, the one-man band.” I was practically only paid with food and free beers, but playing in front of those drunks made me happy. However, it wasn't the optimal job to make ends meet. So when I was offered this job, I had no choice but to take it. At first I was surprised. Work at a gas station that had been closed for years and so close to the area that no one dared to go? I was told not to worry about it. In their own words: “my only job was to warn people like yourselves of the dangers that dwelled there.” From this point on, it was up to you to decide whether to enter the forest or not. The sacrifice had to be voluntary. And that's how I became that hillbilly in every horror movie. Every day I regret not having followed in the steps of my old friend Hasil and hit the road in search of places to play. The life of a musician on the road... maybe that's what I need to feel alive again” 



“Voluntary sacrifice?! You knew this was going to happen.” 



“Hey, don't blame me. Didn't you hear what I said? I warned you and you still decided to go. That's why they call it voluntary sacrifice.” 



“This is crazy. What you're saying can't be true.” She got up abruptly. “I need to use your phone.” 



“I've already told you. The police can't do anything, they always stay away from this place. Besides, my phone can't make calls, it can only receive them. Look, I know nothing I say will cheer you up. But feel lucky, not everyone is lucky enough to escape from that place. You can spend the night here and I'll drive you into town tomorrow.” 



“Lucky? My friends are dead! My boyfriend is...” A deafening scream interrupted her. It wasn't a cry for help. “No, no, no, no, no! They're here!”



“Shit! Were you in the basement?”



“Wha... What?” 



“The Rusty House, damn it! Were you in its basement?” 



“I... I don't know, I think so.” 



“Fuck! Then you shouldn't be here.” 



I ran to my room and she followed me. I grabbed the shotgun. It was unloaded. I hadn't bought shells in a while. I prayed that my bluff would work. I pointed the gun at her. 



“What are you doing? Please, you have to help me!”



“Get out immediately. I don't know how you did it, but there is no possible escape for those who enter the basement. You have lured them here.” 



“I can't go back to that place! Help me, please!”



“I won't repeat myself. Get out if you don't want to get shot.” 



After a while of crying without saying anything, she seemed to accept her fate and walked outside.  There was silence for a few minutes, then I could hear her screams along with the inhuman screams of the thing that was dragging her back into the woods.  Dead silence again. When I was sure that the danger had passed I stuck my head out of the window.  There was no trace of the girl left and the only sound coming from the woods was the wind and crickets. “This life is going to kill me one of these days...” I thought as I opened another can of beer, sat back down on the porch and resumed what I was doing before the interruption.



I lost track of time. It was twelve noon the next day when the phone woke me up, drilling into my hungover head. I awkwardly went to answer the call. 



“¿Yes?” 



“Yesterday was unusual. We may be closer to our purpose.” 



“Aha…” 



“With sacrifices like yesterday's, our resurgence is inevitable and... sorry, were you saying something?” 



“No, I was just yawning. I didn't sleep very well tonight.” 



“Oh. Well, as I was saying, the resurgence is coming and your role is crucial in all of this. You're more important than you think.” 



“That's what I wanted to talk about. How many years have I been here now? 8? 9?” 



“It'll be 10 years in a few months.” 



“Too many years watching life go by without doing anything.” 



“What?”



“I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, I'm quitting.” 



“You don't understand. This is not a job you just walk away from. Don't you realize the consequences of that?” 



“You'll find someone else.” 



“It doesn't work like that. The die is cast, we can't look for someone else now.” 



“In that case, will you come here to stop me from leaving?” There was no answer. “Just what I thought.” 



“Listen to me! You're making the biggest mistake of your life! The consequences of your actions will condemn us all.” 



“I'm sure it won't be a big deal.” 



“There's no need for me to come and get you, others will.”



“I'm hanging up now.” 



“Wait! You're going to…”



The decision was made. This was no longer a life for me. I loaded my instruments in the van. No more being that hillbilly in every horror movie. Isaac Low Strings, the one man band is back no matter what the consequences. I'll release those awful songs I recorded with my 4-track cassette recorder in the gas station storage room and hit the road in search of places to play in exchange for a bed and a plate of food, that's all I need. In the words of the great Mississippi Fred McDowell, life of a hobo is the only life for me. I'm truly sorry if I've condemned anyone by quitting my job, but life is too short to take on so many responsibilities. Bye and see you on the road.
