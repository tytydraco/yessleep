Hey guys, I just wanted to ask a question of the reddit community as I'm having a bit of a weird experience. Everyone knows that website mods are fairly strict, right? If you've ever written a story for a writing forum then you'll almost certainly have fallen foul of one rule or another and seen that dreaded  "Your post has been removed" message pop up a few minutes after you hit submit. They're pretty cool on most sites and let you rework whatever didn't fly, setting up your series properly or making sure there's plot or whatever, but this situation has me a little concerned.

I recently popped out a story about a sort of grey laziness-ghost for one of the horror forums. Bit of a commentary on my own procrastination tendencies, it was this creature that sapped the protagonist's will to do things and made him into a pile of goo - I'll fully admit it was self-indulgent and not my best work. Anyway I put it up a week ago and not a minute later saw the damn notification pop up. Checking what was wrong though I found it was a rule I hadn't noticed before:

_"Not scary enough."_

Obviously since it was a horror forum the scariness of stories is a given, so this was a rule I hadn't broken before. Confused, I asked what they meant exactly, and the message came back:

_"Your story needs the character to show Fear to post here. Please show us the Fear."_

Weird. My story had my character being scared of the lazy ghost, but re-reading showed me that it was more about the procrastination than the fear and it could honestly have done with him reacting more. Grumbling a little I made the edits and re-submitted. The notification popped up again, even quicker this time.

_"You're still missing true Fear, Alex."_

This is where I started getting concerned and wanted to ask opinions from the community. I don't have my name on my profile anywhere and haven't mentioned it in any posts, and yet the moderator seemed to know it. Maybe I'd linked to something connected to my name in the past, but it's strange for a mod to find that and then use my first name in an official message, right? It came from the proper account and everything.

Either way I was creeped out, and also annoyed that this person was seemingly targeting my story. I lashed out a little, editing the work to make the MC almost comically terrified, screaming and gibbering at the sight of a dumb ghost that definitely didn't merit the reaction. Submitting again, I specifically asked for a different mod to review it.

The notification came in seconds this time, the number glowing red in the dark background of the app.

_"Not your character's Fear, Alex. We mean yours."_

I stared at the message, a trickling feeling running down my spine, before another one came through.
_"How can you write Fear if you don't know it yourself?"_

This is where I became really unsettled. This didn't seem to be about the story any more, something else was happening. Maybe the mod account had been hacked or something, but the fact they knew my name was worrying me.

_'Everything is about the story, Alex"_

A knock suddenly sounded at my front door, the sharp sound making me jump.

_"Come and let us in, Alex. We'll help you write."_

What the hell was going on? This couldn't be related, the knocking had to be something innocent that just seemed related to the message. Thoroughly spooked, but not wanting to let some weird trolling attempt by a random mod get to me, I went to answer the door. Nothing was there. Just the darkening street outside my house, empty, a chill in the air making me shiver. 

A sense of dread growing inside me, I locked the door and returned to my tablet. No new messages, the app was silent. I breathed out a shaky breath, feeling foolish that I'd let myself get wound up by this.

'Y̷o̷u̷ ̷s̷h̷o̷u̷l̷d̷ ̷h̷a̷v̷e̷ ̷c̷h̷e̷c̷k̷e̷d̷ ̷t̷h̷e̷ ̷p̷i̷n̷n̷e̷d̷ ̷p̷o̷s̷t̷.̷'

The warped words came from behind my left shoulder. I flew out of my chair, eyes wide as I stared into my dim room.

'Who's there?!' I shouted at the empty space. Seconds dragged by, marked only by the rasping of my breath. I was alone in my room...

'S̷t̷o̷r̷i̷e̷s̷ ̷n̷e̷e̷d̷ ̷F̷e̷a̷r̷,̷ ̷A̷l̷e̷x̷.̷ ̷W̷e̷ ̷w̷a̷n̷t̷ ̷t̷o̷ ̷s̷e̷e̷ ̷y̷o̷u̷r̷ ̷F̷e̷a̷r̷.̷'

This time I saw it, a shadowed form hovering in the corner of my room, hooded and near formless, barely more than textured shadows. Menace emanated from it, darkness seeping from its shape like greasy smoke as I stared at it in terror. The thing held me in its powerful gaze.

Barely aware of what I was doing I picked up a stapler from my desk and hurled it at the figure. It passed straight harmlessly through, striking the wall behind the monster.

'A̷b̷u̷s̷e̷ ̷o̷f̷ ̷m̷o̷d̷s̷ ̷w̷i̷l̷l̷ ̷n̷o̷t̷ ̷b̷e̷ ̷t̷o̷l̷e̷r̷a̷t̷e̷d̷.̷ ̷Y̷o̷u̷ ̷h̷a̷v̷e̷ ̷b̷e̷e̷n̷ ̷g̷i̷v̷e̷n̷ ̷a̷ ̷3̷ ̷d̷a̷y̷ ̷b̷a̷n̷.̷'

All at once the figure lunged, icy tendrils engulfing me and dragging me down into a pit of screaming, tormented unconsciousness.

They let me breathe again about three days later, and I haven't slept since I gasped back to life. The figure is still here, hovering silently, unblinkingly, watching everything I do. I can't leave, can't eat, and I barely dare to take my eyes off it. So my question to the community is: Do the mods know where you live too? And how do I make them leave?
