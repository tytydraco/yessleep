&#x200B;

Brice stopped by last week. I wasn't expecting it and I'm not a fan of people stopping by unannounced. Okay, maybe I've been neglecting some calls and texts here and there. It's not that I don't want to answer. I just got busy.

&#x200B;

I did have to admit, though I was happy to see him in person.  I wish Sheila could’ve stopped by too, and here’s where I have to call her out. Brice told me she didn’t want to come over. When I asked why, he said that it was because I was too obsessed with whatever it is I’m doing. Other than people directly in my work circle, my friends only have a vague idea of what I do.

&#x200B;

That is except for Brice and Sheila. This is only due to one particular incident that I don’t feel like getting into right now. That said, they should know by now how important what I’m doing is so I don’t understand why they have an issue with it. Yeah, I’ll be the first to admit, I’m obsessed with it, but that’s like being obsessed with putting out a forest fire. In both cases, I think it’s warranted.

&#x200B;

Anyway, Brice and I did hang out for a little while. Other than the bit of awkwardness about Sheila, it was a fun time. For what it’s worth, I did tell Brice to tell her I said hello. I know it’s not much. I want her to know that I haven’t forgotten about her. With all that out of the way, I’ll now transcribe the contents of the next tape.

&#x200B;

**\[The contents of this tape are believed to take place during the late 60s and early 90s.\]**

&#x200B;

That detail is the most peculiar one. It's been established that a home camera doesn't necessarily have to be present for events to be recorded. The perspective is from the one Ludus challenges. The most common thread is that the events of all the tapes thus far were during times home cameras were accessible to the home, albeit expensively. This tape seems to contradict this notion.

&#x200B;

Why, I’m not sure. Furthermore, it's also the first tape we've seen that shows two different decades, being nearly thirty years apart.

&#x200B;

*The main focus is a girl by the name of Lakisha Gardner. She appears to be either a preteen or in her early teens. Also present are her parents,  Troy, her father,  Jeannie, her mother, Cora, her grandmother, and Mel, her grandfather. It begins with Lakisha in school. The time period appears to be the 90s given the technology some kids have. The bell rings and the teacher tells everyone to enjoy their weekend.*

&#x200B;

*She gets up and exits the classroom, then the building.  Her friends accompany her during her walk home and they talk about their plans. While they are enthusiastic, she is less inclined. She tells them she'll see them later and they go their separate ways. Eventually, she gets to a restaurant by the name of Gardner's BBQ and enters it.*

&#x200B;

*The establishment is full of patrons with tables being waited.  Lakisha makes her way to the back where she sees Mel coming out of the kitchen.*

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "I swear if they spill another…"

&#x200B;

He *sees Lakisha and smiles.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "How's school?"

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "It was fine. I didn't see Mom or Dad's car so I came here."

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "Yeah, I figured. They must be working late again. The nerve of them thinking they can just dump babysitting on me whenever."

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "Sorry."

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "It's not your fault. Tell you what, I'm going to be busy for a little while, but, I'll whip you up something great later. That sound good?"

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "Actually, I have something I want to show you. I mean, I know you're busy right now."

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere."

&#x200B;

*Mel is about to say something else when something catches his attention. He runs past Lakisha. It pans him rushing forward and catching a plate of food a waiter drops off a platter. He grits from the pain and yet manages to put it back on.*

&#x200B;

*He then scolds the waiter before finishing up the conversation.*

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "I didn't know old people could be that fast."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Mel is offended at first, then laughs.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "And I didn't know you kids could be so mouthy. Anyway, I can look at what you want after the rush, okay?"

&#x200B;

*The footage bobs up and down.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "Good, back to work then."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Several hours go by as indicated by the color of the sky when the footage resumes. In Lakisha's lap is a history textbook along with a notebook. The segment she is on has to do with the civil rights movement and MLK in general.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “What’re you looking at?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lakisha turns to see her grandfather looking over her shoulder.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "Just some homework."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "Ah, Martin, you know I met him back in the day."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "Really?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "Come on, I'll tell you all about it."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She follows him inside. He motions her to sit at a table. On it are two plates. One has ribs and the other a peach cobbler.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "I made sure to save something just for you."

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "Thanks, Grandpa, so how did you know him? What was he like?"

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "I went to one of his sermons. This was before he got a lot of press. I did my fair share of traveling back in the day. Let me tell ya, you had to watch your back in a lot of places, especially growing up in the South."

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "How did you manage?"

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "I made sure I knew the safest parts of where I went, relatively speaking and I was with your grandma. She was a smart woman and she was good at making friends."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The scene changes, this time showing the inside of a moving car.  A young woman in her early to mid-20s is in the passenger seat.  Lakisha and Mel's conversation can be heard over the imagery shown. The woman glances over and smiles.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "I wish I could remember more about Grandma Cora."

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "You know she loved you."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Why the tape suddenly formatted this way, we aren’t sure. I’ve also been wondering if there’s any significance behind it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “We didn’t have much back then except each other and our rust bucket. Even without all the abuse it had, it was only a pothole away from breaking down, but I was ready to get the hell out and take us somewhere better. There was one town we went to where she ended up getting hurt. When that happened, I was ready to raise hell.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The footage shows the couple driving through a remote town where the residents seem hostile. It jumps forward and rocks can be seen being thrown at the vehicle. One breaks through the passenger window and gashes the woman across the face.  The driver curses at their attackers and slams on the brakes. The view shifts as if the driver is getting ready to exit the vehicle.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He stops and looks over to see the woman griping his wrist. She shakes her head. The driver inhales and then they continue their drive with the mob still throwing objects and yelling obscenities.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “She was always better at keeping her cool, though and she stopped me from doing something really stupid. After that, we cut through Georgia and ended up grabbing a bite to eat in Atlanta where we got to talking to people who went to Martin’s church. They invited us over for a sermon. We weren’t super god bothering, but we figured it couldn’t hurt..”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The footage cuts forward again, now showing a sermon by MLK which is received with modest applause. Later, the pov is of a handshake with him and he smiles.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “Martin seemed like a good guy. Although, maybe not the most loyal in the marriage department from what I heard later on. Then again, we all have our flaws I guess. That didn’t stop him from having a way with words, though. I was ready to write off ever living here again before we heard him talk. Can you believe that meeting him once is all it took for us to change our minds and go back to this town to build our restaurant?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “Wow, what did he say?"

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "I talked to him after the sermon about where we came from and how we never wanted to go back. I was shocked when he told me that was a shame. When I asked him why, he said that it was because those places wouldn't change their ways without our help. We spent a few more days in Atlanta and after some talking we decided to head back to town."

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "Did you see him on the news?"

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “Of course and I thought he seemed familiar. When  I showed Carla she remembered who he was and I was shocked."

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “What did she think of seeing him?”

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “She had a way of knowing about people so what he did wasn’t too surprising to her. By then, we managed to get our restaurant established and even held some meetings there. A lot of support went to what Martin was doing. Then again, others thought he was too soft.”

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “Like that Malcolm guy?”

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “Among others, yeah and believe me, I could get their anger."

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "Did you ever meet him?"

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "No, I knew some people he did. Some thought he was going too far and others thought he said what we needed to hear."

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "So who did people like more, him or Martin?"

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “Well, you have to understand their messages weren't exactly popular with a majority of people at the time. Sure, what Martin said seems like common sense now. Back then, things were different. People weren’t as open-minded. Some still aren’t, but at least it’s better compared to back then. Hell, there were times I thought about getting my hands dirty, especially when people threatened my family or my livelihood."

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "How were you able to open this place anyway?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Me****l*** *chuckles.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "Let's just say that back then, your grandad knew his way around a deck of cards. Your grandma didn't care for it, though. At least it helped when things got desperate. It took us years of working to the bone and a lot of luck, but we pulled it off."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The scene changes again, showing various places of employment, eventually stopping at a freshly established Gardener's BBQ. It then goes back to Lakisha and Mel's conversation in the restaurant.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "Thanks, Grandpa, I've learned a lot."

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "Anytime, Kiddo, hey, you had something you wanted to show me, right?"

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "Oh…Yeah."

&#x200B;

**Mel:** "Well, show it then. I'm not getting any younger."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*From her backpack, Lakisha pulls out a ziplock bag of brownies.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "I made these in home ec class. I thought you might like them."

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “Well, they look good. Mind if I try one?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lakisha hands the bag over. Mel removes a brownie and bites into it.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “This is mighty tasty! I might just have to put these on the menu.”

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “You mean that?”

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “Yeah, I mean it. We’ll make them together.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The footage skips forward once again showing the inside of Gardener’s. The tables are shorter indicating Lakisha has aged several years and undergone a growth spurt. From how she sounds, she’s in her late teens. The restaurant is empty. She goes to the back to see her grandpa sleeping at his desk.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*On it are several sheets of paper, showing various expenses due.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “Grandpa?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He wakes up abruptly and notices she sees the papers. He swipes them in a stack and flips them facedown.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “Listen, if you need money, I could always ask Mom and Dad too…”

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “No!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He slams his hand on his desk, then calms down.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “I’m sorry. Look, you don’t need to trouble yourself with this. I’ve pulled myself out of much tighter spots.”

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “Is there anything I could help you with then?”

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “Well, now that you mention it, the new guy did mess up cleaning the dishes. Think you could help me out?”

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “I’d be more than happy too.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*They are then shown cleaning dishes together followed by Lakisha driving her grandpa home. She leads him upstairs.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “Sleep well, I’ll call my parents and let them know I’m spending the night here.”

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “Okay, see you in the morning, Love you.”

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “Love you too.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lakisha is shown downstairs flipping through channels on TV.  Suddenly, it cuts to static.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is when we knew it was coming and that got my heart beating faster.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lakisha is about to get up to check the antenna when Ludus appears on the screen. Confused, Lakisha tries using the remote again to no avail.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “That will do you no good.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lakisha abruptly straightens herself.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “There’s no need to be alarmed, at least not yet.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lakisha’s voice is shaky when she responds.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “Did I fall asleep?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus laughs.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As an aside, I’m getting sick of hearing that. It’s in my dreams sometimes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “You’re awake. What you are seeing is real.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lakisha, sensing she isn’t being lied to, gets up.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I am known as Ludus and I come offering you a deal.”

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “I don’t care. I don’t know what the hell you are, but if you don’t leave…”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “It’ll help your grandfather.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She stops.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Will you at least hear me out?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lakisha decides to comply.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “Fine.”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I want to play a game with you. If you win, your grandpa’s debts will be taken care of and no, this isn’t in some monkey’s paw way either. He’ll get to enjoy the rest of his natural laugh as he pleases without any worries.”

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “What happens if I lose?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I’m free to do with you as I please.”

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “Are you some kind of demon?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I’ve been called many things. If you don’t want to accept the challenge just say so and I’ll never bother you again.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She considers his offer.*

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I must say, though. It would be a shame for all his hard work to go to waste, but if you’re okay with that it’s your choice.”

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “What’s the game?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:**  “It will use two decks of playing cards. I assume your grandpa has some lying around?”

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “He does.”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Very good, now the rules are as follows: Each of us will shuffle our decks and layout our cards face down. We’ll then find matches among them. If we happen to find matches at the same time, our cards will be pitted against each other. The player with the highest value will add them to their stack pile and the one with the lowest will have to discard them.”

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “So it’s like a match game mixed with I Declare War?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:**  “Essentially and when all cards have been picked up, whoever has the match pile with the highest value wins. Now, will you accept my challenge?”

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “I’d never forgive myself if I didn't at least try to help him. I’ll win and wipe his worries away.”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “That’s the spirit. Let’s begin. Shall we?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The scene then cuts to the game. Lakisha has a blue deck with the cards laid out face down on the coffee table with Ludus having a red deck. Lakisha wastes no time in flipping cards over. Two reveal a diamond of two and a club of four. Cursing, she turns them back over. She glances at what Ludus is doing.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The cards are being interacted with, getting flipped over and flipped back telekinetically.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I swear this was borderline cheating.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lakisha goes faster, turning cards over and finding a match of tens.*

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Looks like we found some at the same time. You know what that means.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus shows a match of Jacks.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “Damn it…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She discards her match while Ludus adds to its pile. They both find matches one after the other and the next time they pit their matches against each other. Ludus shows a natch of Jacks again and Lakisha responds with a match of queens. Lakisha speaks, sounding more confident.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “Look who has to get rid of their cards now.”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “You shouldn’t be celebrating so early, girl. I still have plenty of cards left.”

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “And you shouldn’t underestimate us  Gardeners.”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I haven’t. That’s why I chose you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The game continues for some time, with each player gaining matches and also losing some.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This has to be the most on-edge I’ve ever been with these tapes. Every time it seemed like Lakisha was about to pull ahead, Ludus would gain the advantage again. Like the other players, I hoped she would be the one to beat him. I know I should realize that’s stupid by now. I just have to hold onto something.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If I didn’t  I would have let my fear of it overwhelm me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus’s cards are nearly gone with Lakisha slightly behind. Each of their discard piles is roughly the same amount. The last match they each get at the same time which means their cards are pitted against each other. Laughing again, Ludus shows a pair of Ace’.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Too bad, girl, it seems you couldn’t help your grandfather after all.”

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “Are you sure about that?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She shows her match, a pair of jokers. Ludus lets out a sound of annoyance.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “You don’t sound confident.”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Save your gloating until after our numbers have been added up.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*A red mist appears on Ludus’s side. It read one hundred and sixty-six*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A bead of sweat dripped down my face as we watched this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Blue mist appears in front of Lakihsa. It also reads one hundred and sixty-six. The nervousness in Lakisha’s voice returns.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “What does this mean?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “That’s a good question. Technically you didn’t lose. Then again, you didn’t win either and the consequences of a game must be adhered to.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus chuckles.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Your wish will be granted.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lakisha gasps in surprise before Ludus continues.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “At a cost.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*His form shoots out from the TV. Lakisha screams under the impression it's coming for her. Instead, it goes past her and up the stairs.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** “No!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She runs after it and finds it in Mel’s bedroom. Ludus enters his nostrils. He wakes up with a gasp, clutching his chest. Laksihas rushes over.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** ” Grandpa, just hold on!.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He falls back with his eyes still open. Ludus, still laughing is breathed out. It vanishes. Lakisha cries while attempting CPR on Mel. The footage ends.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Every time I think I’m over how depressing and horrifying this whole situation is, things like that act as a cold splash of water in my face. We managed to narrow down the town where the tape took place. I was the one to go since according to Dean I could finally get out for more than a couple hours. I can't say he was wrong. I provided a transcript of my conversation with Lakisha.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It turned out she and her parents run Gardener's BBQ now. I entered the restaurant about half an hour before closing. She was the only one managing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "Hey, I hope you know we're closing down soon. If you want something you better hope we already have it made.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I went over to her and presented my credentials.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Me:** "Actually, I needed to ask you some questions, Mrs. Gardener."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Lakisha became irritated at this point.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "What the hell do you want? All our expenses have been taken care of."

&#x200B;

**Me:** "I'm not here about that."

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "What are you here for then?"

&#x200B;

**Me:** "Does the name Ludus ring a bell?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I hated seeing how shaken she got just by my saying that word.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "Can you wait while I finish up?"

&#x200B;

**Me:** "No problem."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Soon, it was only us. We sat at one of the booths.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "Before I answer any questions, tell me how you know about any of this."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I thought she deserved to know seeing as how she is the only survivor of Ludus's game we've come across.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "So these tapes just appeared one day?"

&#x200B;

**Me:** "Yeah, how or why we still aren't sure. I…We've been trying to find a way to stop Ludus. You were close to beating it. That has to be worth something."

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "My grandpa used to say close only counts for horseshoes and hand grenades. I lost him in the end. I was supposed to help him and instead, I caused his death. Everyone thinks he just passed in his sleep and I can't tell anyone the truth even though I want to. At least his death brought my family and me closer together.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Lakisha wipes away some tears.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Me:** "I'm very sorry for your loss. I want you to know we're doing everything in our power to stop Ludus."

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "Thank you, I've been trying to forget that night for years now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She smiled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "Maybe it's good that I didn't and it's good to finally talk about this to someone who won't think I've lost it."

&#x200B;

**Me:** "Does that mean you know something that could help?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She pondered my question.

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "There was a sense I got when I was close to winning. I don't know how else to put it. Maybe that's the key to winning."

&#x200B;

**Me:** "What were you thinking about when you felt it?"

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "How I wanted to help Grandpa Mel and how he deserved not to be burdened. His debts were wiped away, thankfully. Otherwise, we would've had to close this place years ago. I was planning on going to college, but my parents were short-staffed and I didn't have the heart to leave."

&#x200B;

**Me:** "I can see why. It's a nice place. Would you mind if I took a bit of food with me?"

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "I think we have something left over.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She brought me some ribs, peach cobbler, a bottle of tea, and some brownies. When I went to pay, she told me it was on the house.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Me:** "Thanks so much."

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "I hope you enjoy it and one thing before you go?"

&#x200B;

I was about to get up.

&#x200B;

**Me:** "What is it?"

&#x200B;

**Lakisha:** "Don't push yourself too hard. You kind of remind me of me when my grandpa passed."

&#x200B;

I responded with a nod, then left. I have to say the food was phenomenal and the brownies were even better than Mel made them out to be. Despite my terror of Ludus, I'm glad I can at least end one of these transcript posts on a somewhat positive note.
