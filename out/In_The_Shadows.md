I was never afraid of the dark.

Vampires, zombies, the monster under my bed. None of it ever really scared me, I just knew it wasn't real. 

**I was never afraid of the dark**.

What was there to be scared of? Nothing could happen. It wasn't real. It's not real. And it never will be.

*I am not afraid of the dark.*




My family was never very close. The few moments we would spend together, are memories I've cherished from the moment they occurred. Birthdays, celebrations, and best of all, the random days. Those are the days that really made us feel like a family.

I know they loved them, too.

We aren't-- we weren't poor. *Weren't.*

Far from it, in fact. Our house had three floors. More than yous expect for a family of six. My the bedrooms were on the second floor, with our parents' on the third. The first floor was our living room, kitchen, and dining room. The dining room was connected to the living room, separated only by the staircase. 

The only thing each room had in common was the light. Warm, comforting yellow. All except for the attic.

The attic was the only part of the house I avoided. It was old, creaky, and was about as far as possible from a place I'd want to stay. It was lined with boxes on both sides, with a small window on the end opposite the entrance.

Our house was big, but we knew it. We recognized it. It was ours. 

My family was never close. Maybe I should be thankful. That night was as close as we would ever get.

The nights before it were nothing ordinary, either. 

First, it was the little things. An already dark room, becoming pitch black in seconds, then going back to normal just as fast; lights flickering, despite having no problems before; random gusts of wind, despites no open windows.

Everything had an explanation, at least.

But, about a week before that night, something changed.

It wasn't just the lights anymore. Things would happen, that we had no way to explain. Bags would go from intact to shreds, their contents spewed out during the night; dishes would shatter the second you looked away from there; curtains would always be drawn in empty rooms.

And worst of all, the sounds.

Distorted, high pitched ringing would accompany these occurrences. Each more frequent than the last. It felt right next me, yet so far away, at the same time.

My family was never close. Maybe if we were, we could have avoided this.

We all thought we were the crazy ones. No one else said anything about it, clearly none of this stuff was happening to anyone else.

But that was impossible.

My sister was the first one to bring it up. 

It just so happened that all of our schedules lined up so that we could eat together for lunch, at 16:30, which was coincidentally the earliest we were all free. Just another one of those random days. Somehow, a conversation about our trip to the beach a few years prior was what reminded her.

"Have any of you, um," she paused, "have you guys been noticing some weird things happening recently?"

Everyone looked at one another. We all had the same thought. We weren't crazy. "Like," she continued, "my schoolbag was ripped open when I woke up yesterday. It was perfectly fine the night before..."

No one admitted to entering her room that night.

"When I was washing the dishes yesterday," my mother began, "the new glass china I bought just last week. The plate broke in my hand while I was scrubbing it! Not a scratch it had before that."

"Well, I told you before you bought it," my father started, "that china was no good. But you didn't listen. You just *had* to buy it. And now look what it's led to. All that tim-"

"Oh, you knew bloody well how long I'd been looking for this set," my mother said, clearly a conflict originating, "you just want any reason to make me the enemy!"

This was where I left the room, seemingly unnoticed, as our conversation was cut short by my parents' quarrel, per usual.

I checked my phone, while walking up the stairs.

*17:14*

Had it been that long? It couldn't have been more than 20 minutes while we were eating, at 16:30. How was it possible that 45 minutes passed?

I stopped walking.

I knew for sure that I had been looking at my phone for only a couple of seconds. I knew for sure that I had just come from the dining room on the first floor. I knew for sure that all I had done while walking was check my phone.

So how was it possible that I was on the attic ladder?

I heard the same ringing. The sun had only just started setting, yet the inside of the attic was almost pitch black.

I got down immediately. I closed the attic's entrance and immediately went down the stairs. 

My parents had stopped fighting. They had moved into the kitchen, while my siblings were in the lounge.

"Something really weird just happened", I started, "how long were we eating lunch?"

My older brother, Arthur, responded, "I'm not sure... Probably like half an hour?"

"I thought that too, but when I went upstairs, I checked the time. It was 17:14. It had been 44 minutes. And not just that," I continued, "all I did was check the time, I know I was only walking for a few seconds, yet I was on the attic ladder. And I heard that terrible ringing."

My brother replied, "And you're just telling us this now?"

I didn't understand what he meant. "What are you talking about? It just happened."

He looked confused. "Matthew... You were up there for two hours."

... What?

I checked the time.

*19:21*

Two hours had passed since I was on the attic ladder.

"Matt, are you okay?" my older sister, Luna, asked.

"No, I...", I didn't know how to explain what just happened. How could I have? "I just came down from the attic right now... I wasn't there for two hours..."

Something weird was happening. I knew it, he knew it, my sisters knew it.

"And Matt, the ringing..." My younger sister, Sofia, started. Just as she finished that word, every light in the house went off. The entire house went pitch black.

"Matt, where are you?" I hear my brother's voice, "give me your phone, I'll go and get candles."

"I'm right here, Arthur," I held my phone out. someone grabbed it. The torch immediately turned on, a dim light shining upon the lounge.

"Thanks, I'll go and get the candles. You three stick together. Then we'll all go and get mom and dad." Arthur finished.

"I'll come with you. It's better to stick together," said Luna, my older sister. Then she turned to us. "You two stay here."

They both left upstairs, taking the only source of light with them. The lounge was once again pitch black.

A few seconds of silence, a virtual eternity in my mind, before Sofia spoke.

"Matt, what were you saying about the ringing?"

I turned towards the source of the noise, where I imagined her to be. I started to hear that ringing again.

"Well, I-"

"Matt, the ringing." She said again.

The ringing got louder.

"Sofia, I-"

"Matt, the ringing."

The ringing got louder. Her voice wasn't coming from the same place anymore.

"Matt, the ringing."

*Her voice got louder*

"Matt, the ringing."

*The ringing got louder*

"Matt, the ringing."

*Silence.*

I bolted away from where the sound was screaming, yelling Arthur's name. I slammed my leg against the side of the stairs, just as I heard their rushed footsteps approaching, and the light dimly illuminating the room.

"What happened?!" Arthur asked

"Arthur, I-"

"Where's Sofia?" Luna cut me off.

"Sofia was just-" I turned around. She wasn't there. No one was there.

"Matthew, where's Sofia?!" Luna yelled, I tried to explain. Arthur lit a candle and placed it in the centre of the lounge, illuminating it with that familiar yellow glow.

"Sofia, something happened and this ringing started and I- I- hear her repeating and asking ab- about the ringing and-", I tried to explain through tears.

Arthur turned to us. He was pointing the phone's torch at something on the ground. I couldn't make it out through my blurred vision.
"Luna... Call Mom and Dad." She started to walk away, "from here!" She stopped.

"What's wrong?" she asked.

"Luna, just call them."

She called out for them.

No response.

She called out again.

No response.

She called out for them again.

At the same time, we all reacted. We all reacted to that same demonic, distorted ringing sound.

Arthur reacted immediately. He pointed the torch to the direction of the ringing. 

The light distorted, and flickered for a second. Then went back to normal. The ringing stopped.

"Arthur..." Luna said, "Arthur what did you see??"

Arthur didn't take his eyes off the staircase. He spoke low almost in a whisper, "Luna... It's just the three of us now."

"Arthur, what are you saying?" She said, her voice breaking slightly

"Luna, the other three aren't here anymore."

The edge of the candles light illuminated a trail of red leading to somewhere outside of view.

Luna screamed. Arthur covered her mouth. I kept sobbing. 

The ringing appeared again. Arthur immediately pointed the light to wherever it came from. The same distortion. The same flickering. And the ringing went away again.

If it hadn't been for the sound of Luna's sobs, you'd have thought time was stopped. For a few seconds, nothing happened. 

We heard glass shatter.

The phone in Arthur's hand slammed on the ground, shards spread everywhere.

The inhuman ringing sound came back, more intense. We felt bursts of wind all around us, getting closer, and stronger. The ringing was getting louder.

*Louder*

**Louder**

Something screeched, and with it, wind, strong enough to knock all three of us off our feet. 

The candle went out.

The thing screeched as we heard it getting closer. All three of us, still on the ground, we could feel it getting closer, hear that ringing in my ears, feeling like they would explode. I screamed. I heard Luna scream.

I shut my eyes tight, despite the house being pitch black. I scrambled around desperately for the matches, somewhere. I heard Luna scream louder, just as I found them, lighting one as quickly as possible. That was the closest I got to seeing what that thing was.

Tall, inhumanly tall. About three metres. Grey skin, with no eyes. Its "mouth" a dark red gaping hole, longer than my arm. Each of its teeth impossible sharp, dripping with blood, its arms longer than should have been possible.

That's all I saw before it disappeared out of the light, along with the ringing.

I lit the candle. Luna was next to me, thankfully unharmed. I could see the bottom of Arthur's legs in the candlelight, the rest of his body unseen.

"Luna..." I heard Arthur say, just beyond the lights edge.

"Arthur, are you okay??" She half screamed, half cried.

"Luna, it's just the two of you now"

Arthur's body stepped forward into view, his body mangled, and bloody, his eyes lifeless, his skin torn apart. He collapsed forward.

I screamed. Luna stayed silent. The ringing came back. Everything happened at once.

I grabbed Luna, and the candle, and bolted out the front door, towards the trees. I ran faster than I've ever run before. I heard that thing screeching louder than before, and parts of the house being blown apart. I kept running, taking Luna with me. I didn't stop to look back until the sunrise. I heard one last screech from that thing, before collapsing, Luna right next to me. I turned around.

What was once a three story house, now looked like the ruins of a cabin, wooden planks blown everywhere, structures broken down, glass shattered. No sign of the corpses of mom, dad, Sofia, or Arthur.

The only part of the house that remained intact was the attic. I could still see the window from this far away. The same window I had seen every day coming back from school, my whole life. Staring back at me.

But it was morning. We had made it.

"We made it, Luna."

*No response*

"Luna?"

I looked to my side at Luna. The same Luna I had been taking with me since the house. The same Luna I ran all the way out here with. The same Luna that Arthur spoke to when he died.

The same Luna, in the same condition as Arthur, bloody, mangled, bones twisted in the wrong way. Her mouth was ripped out and her eyes was watery.

I broke down.

Her hand was cold. I hadn't noticed. She didn't scream. I hadn't noticed. I carried her full weight from the house to here. I hadn't noticed.

All I had thought about was the fact we'd made it.

I didn't realise that I was too slow to run with her.

I didn't realise that she was behind me.

I didn't realise I barely escaped that thing myself.

*I didn't realise.*




It's been three years since that night. I've been job hopping, but managed to land a pretty good job with decent pay. I live on the other side of the country now. I don't plan on revisiting that city ever again.

I had Luna's body cremated. I told them she died in a bear attack. I brought her with me. Arthur, Mom, Dad, and Sofia's bodies were never found.

I think about that night every day. What if I had been faster? What if I had paid more attention to Sofia when we were supposed to be together? How was I in the attic for two hours...?

I'm scared of what the answers to those questions might be.

I was never afraid of the dark.

*Because it's not real*

I am not afraid the dark.

*It's not real*

But the light...

The light shows me what is.
