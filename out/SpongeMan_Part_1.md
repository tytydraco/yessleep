I used to live in a place of anarchy.

It is wealthy and well-developed now, but it was not always like this. It was filled to the brim with crimes and lawlessness. Over time, though, things have gotten better. The crime rate dropped as more people found jobs, and the community started to stabilize.

Anarchy has become rare nowadays. But it still exists, even after all these years. I, myself, have seen my fair share of torts and crimes, from accidents to murders. You name it.

But there exists one incident which still haunts me. It happened fifteen years ago. I’ll try to provide the most detailed account of that day and the circumstances surrounding it. However, since it was so long ago, and I was pretty young at the time, there’s a chance I might misremember or unintentionally exaggerate some aspects of this incident. So please proceed with that in mind.

It happened when I was eight, a few weeks before my ninth birthday. I vividly remember dreaming about my birthday party before waking up on my own. It was a bizarre dream. I don’t remember much, but I do remember my mother being there. It had been six months since her death, and it was hard for me to process a birthday without her.

I got out of bed and walked towards the balcony. My father was surprised to see me awake and sensed something was off.

“What happened? Is something wrong?” Father asked as he kept the newspaper on the coffee table and walked towards me.

“Yeah, just the sunlight,” I said as he stroked my hair.

“Oh, I’ll make sure to close the blinds next time...” he took an uncomfortable pause. He was better at being a single parent but still wasn’t used to it.

“Now go get ready. The driver said that he will come early today.”

“Why? Is Ava not coming?” I asked in a desperate tone. I had a crush on her even before I knew what a crush was. She and I had a lot in common; for example, her father was a cop, while my father was a cop and turned private investigator. Plus, she was a tomboy, a quality which I admire.

“Don’t worry. Ava and Timothy are coming. The driver just needs to bring the van in for servicing.”

“Servicing?” I asked, rubbing my eyes.

“When a vehicle gets old, they don’t work properly or stop working entirely. When this happens, they are given for servicing, where they are fixed.”

“Oh, is our car serviced, dad?”  
“Don’t worry about our car, champ. It’s all taken care of. Now go get ready for school.”

I don’t remember much about going to school that day or what happened in class—I was really sleepy. But I do remember an announcement the principal made just before the school got over. She addressed a rumor that was spreading in our primary school. The rumour said that some treasure was found on the school premises during the construction of the football field.

I remember her speech vividly because it was the first time I’d seen her that angry. I was also really confused at the time and couldn’t help but giggle during her speech, thinking she had said “Hogwarts” while addressing the rumors. It didn’t last long, though, as Timothy stomped on my foot and explained that she had actually said “Hogwash,” meaning nonsense.

Timothy was like Hermione in our group. He knew a lot and wasn’t shy about sharing his knowledge with others. Even if they were uninterested. Unlike Hermione, he was timid and kind of a pussy. It was impossible to convince him to do anything even remotely fun.

A total buzzkill.

Coming back to the day, “Hogwash” wasn’t the only term I learned from her monologue. Mass Hysteria was another one. She began her speech by explaining what it meant. “Mass Hysteria brings nothing but confusion. It’s an illness,” she said. And it stuck with me. I’d heard stories about people collectively losing their minds, but now I finally had a name for it.

Her monologue lasted for ten minutes, after which we were dismissed. I ran to grab the seat next to the driver while Ava, Timothy, and the other kids went back. Once all the kids were in the van, the driver activated the child locks on the doors and shut them.

There were nine children in the van that day. We three had the last stops. Timothy’s stop was right before mine, and Ava’s was the very last. At each stop, the driver would park the van, get out, and open the door for the kids. He always stayed outside until he saw the kids safely reach their homes.

He and I used to get along. We would talk about all sorts of things like TV shows or the news, but mostly, he liked sharing stories and local legends.

I remember him once telling the story of a war veteran who had lost both of his arms in the war. Later in his life as an old man, he began to believe that each morning, someone would sneak into his home and sever his arms. The old man also claimed that another person would visit late at night to reattach them, only for the cycle to repeat the next day. Not even his devoted daughter believed him. As time passed, the old man grew increasingly paranoid.  
One night, in complete darkness, he leaped from his balcony to his death. His daughter discovered what had happened the next morning. But the eeriest part of the story was her claim that the balcony door had been latched—and the latch was at least two feet above the man’s reach.

I used to enjoy stories like that. I’d always try to sit next to the driver and wouldn’t leave the van until he finished his stories. But that day, it was different.

The driver’s mood seemed off. When I asked him, he said that he could not get the servicing done. When I pressed further, he said, “It’s a long story.” He looked very upset, so I decided not to bother him the entire way home.

Soon, it was just the three of us and the driver in the van.

The middle row of the van, where Ava and Timothy were sitting, had seats that faced each other, something like [this](https://assets.tractorjunction.com/truck-junction/assets/images/truck/mahindra-suprovan-other1.webp?format=webp). (Please note that this isn’t a photo of the van model I was in; it is just a photo of a random van with a similar design.)

In the moving van, Ava and Timothy decided to jump from one seat to the seat in front of them for fun. The driver slowed down the van and yelled, “Stop jumping in the moving van! You’re going to get hurt. If you don’t stop, I’ll tell your parents!” But they didn’t stop.  
Seeing them having fun made me very jealous. I wished that I was there instead of the front.

As the driver was slowing down the van and yelling at them, Ava started to fall in the gap between the two seats. She grabbed Timothy for support and pulled him down with her. The driver quickly pulled over the van and ran outside to help them as both were screaming in pain. He helped both of them and inquired about their injuries, and then he started.

“What did I tell both of you? DON’T JUMP. But you didn’t listen,” he yelled at them while they were still weeping.

“If you guys keep ignoring my instructions from now on, I won’t pick you up!” he warned them.

Uninterested, I started to look outside. ‘I'm going to be so late,’ I thought to myself as I remembered the last time the driver was scolding another child. He got so caught up in it that he only stopped when my mother called, worried about where we were.

The view outside was not exactly picturesque. It was a semi-busy road. I remember seeing cars passing by the van and staring at the van before driving past us. The stares made me feel very uncomfortable as if I was part of some crime scene. Thus, I began looking at the pavement.

It was even more uncomfortable. The pedestrians and bystanders gave weirder and longer stares. But I got used to it. One, in particular, caught my eye: a fancy grocery store. It was unusually large and well-maintained, a rarity in those days.

Then, things took a strange turn. I started to feel a weird commotion as if something was approaching. When I glanced at the bystanders who had been staring at us for all this duration, they were now staring in front. Their reactions were alarming. I could hear some faint screams and fast footsteps. All the people I laid my eyes on were looking in the same direction. I was really confused. I knew something was wrong, and I shouldn’t have been looking in that direction, but I was fascinated.

And then it happened... This is your content warning. If you don’t want to read graphic content, then you can skip the following chunk, which is written in *italics*. I will provide a less graphic description after it.

≥≠=======≠≤

*I saw a strong-looking young man limping towards us. His back was very stiff, and his arms were flopping. He was almost naked, with just a white towel wrapped around his waist. When our eyes met, I realized he was oddly shrinking in size as if something was squeezing him.*

*The towel around his waist began turning red, and tiny bubbles of blood appeared on his skin. He was entirely covered in a froth of blood in a matter of seconds. I remember him collapsing on his knees as I screamed to call the driver. The driver glanced at me and almost instantly noticed the man. He quickly closed the middle door, rushed towards his seat, and tried to start the van. The van did not start. “The servicing,” I thought.*

*So, I was stuck in the front-row seat to witness a gruesome and agonizing death.*

*I just could not look away. He had no visible cuts or bruises on his body. Yet, the blood sort of phased out of his skin, bubbling to the surface. The bubbles merged into larger ones before bursting, creating pools of blood that spread across the pavement and spilled onto the road.*

*He lost all of his bodily fluids, and his muscles shrunk to his bones. Except his mouth, his face was nearly indistinguishable, completely covered by a thick layer of blood froth. I recall his lips moving as if he was trying to speak, and I tried to make out the words. I couldn't decipher anything he said except the very last thing before he collapsed face-first onto the sidewalk: "Help me."*

*Tried to convince the driver to help him, at least call an ambulance, but he ignored my plea. I even tried to get out of the car to help, but my side of the door was child-locked.*

*For the entire time for which we were stuck there, no one rushed to help the man.*

≥≠=======≠≤

For those who skipped, here is the crux:- A man died a very horrifying borderline paranormal death, but no one intervened. Even the van driver. I was trapped in the van, helplessly watching as it unfolded.

Soon, the van started, and the last image I recall of the man was him lying on the sidewalk, lifeless and unattended, as the tires of the van rolled over his remains on the road.

The van was painfully quiet. I remember my eyes locked on the driver for almost the entire way home. Waiting for him to speak, to say anything. But he stayed silent, his gaze fixed on the road.

Instead of Timothy, the driver decided to drop me off first. When we reached my stop, the sound of his door slamming broke the unbearable silence. He rushed towards my door and opened it.

I got out of the van without making any eye contact with him. I hurried towards my home, overwhelmed with emotions. Then he said something.

“There was no saving him.”

I stopped. Part of me wanted to turn around, to argue, to tell him he was wrong. But a deeper part of me knew he was right. After a few moments of contemplation, I resumed walking and reached the door.

“I’m working on a case, Ray. The food on the table. I’ll join you soon,” my father said, turning back just as I stepped through the doorway.

I threw my bag on my bed and headed to take a bath. I turned on the shower and started to sob. I didn’t want my father to know what had happened. I thought that he already had a lot of things to take care of and I should not bother him with this incident.

Looking back, I regret not opening up properly. I had started to suppress my emotions and tried to act like an adult. It all started with my mother’s death. I was overwhelmed with grief when she died, but I never had anyone to share my grief with. No siblings. No close relatives. No friends. No one. So, I tried my best to act like an “adult” all my childhood. To keep my feelings and emotions locked behind an unassuming face.

Anyway, after crying my lungs out in the shower, I came out looking for my father and saw that he had locked his room’s door. So, I ate lunch alone, left him a note on the fridge in case he came out, and decided to go ride my bike.

I met Timothy and Ava at a park in our neighborhood. Some things happened at the park which I can’t recall. I guess I have a faint memory of Ava beating the shit out of Timothy. Maybe, but it used to happen quite often, so I might be misremembering.

But I am sure both of them were pissed off at each other. I was really confused seeing them fight and asked.

“Why are you two fighting?”  
They responded and said it was because of the van incident.

“If you guys were so bothered, then why didn’t you guys help me convince the driver to stop the van and help the man?”

Both of them gave me a confused look. Turns out they were in so much pain that they didn’t notice anything off. It was incomprehensible to me that something like this was even possible. And Timothy agreed.

“Stop lying, Ray,” Timothy said.  
“Why will I lie? What will I get by lying?”

“I don’t know, you tell us,” Timothy said.  
“I’m not lying! We can go back to the spot where it happened and ask the people there about it. ”

Surprisingly, Timothy agreed to the idea almost immediately, while Ava was against it. It was strange—it’s usually the other way around. Ava explained the ways of reaching the location and pointed out potential issues.

There were two routes to the location. The fastest way from the park was to head east toward the Community Hall, to the roundabout, and to the road where the incident occurred. But taking that route meant cycling past my house. If my dad saw me riding my bike on the main road, he’d likely ban me from cycling altogether. It was unlikely that he would see us but he had caught us the last time we tried. I was banned for a week.

So, we had to take the other way. Not only was this path longer, but to reach the location, we would have had to ride along the trolley line.

Ages ago, a trolley system was installed in our area. However, with the advent of buses and other transportation mediums, this system became defunct. The only remnants of this system are the trolley lines. The majority of these lines have disappeared or are withered beyond recognition, except for the line we had to cycle along to reach the location.

This particular line begins a few blocks from the park and ends just before the site of the incident. It’s about a mile long and shows no signs of age. No rust. No cracks. Nothing. Naturally, it’s become a local legend.

Some say that it doesn’t age because it ‘repairs’ itself by killing babies in the womb; thus, pregnant women are ‘strongly’ advised not to come even close to this trolley line. Many people disagree with this legend and state that it kills dogs or cats instead of babies; thus, their version of the legend states that no one should come near the trolley with a pet. Some even say both are wrong, and the trolley line is on top of a temple or a burial ground. Thus, it doesn’t age as it is cursed.

But everyone, including me, agrees that there is something off about this line. In all the houses in the neighborhood, there is at least one unpleasant tale that features the trolley line. And unfortunately, these ‘legends’ have some level of authenticity to them.

So, when Ava pointed out that we would have to cycle alongside the trolley line, we were not as enthusiastic as before.

Ava straight-up said no. She said that we could certainly find out whether I was lying by just asking the driver the day after. Timothy, on the other hand, really wanted to go but was hesitant about biking near the trolley line. He tried convincing us to stick to the usual route, speeding past my house so my dad wouldn’t see us.

I was really conflicted. I wanted to go to the location but didn’t want my father to see where I was going, nor did I want to cycle next to the trolley line. So, I agreed with Ava and decided just to ask the driver to tell them about the incident. That would prove to them that I was not lying. But things didn’t go the way I expected them to go.

I don’t remember much after I left the park. The rest of the day was fine, I guess.

The next day, I woke up early again and left for school. I also don’t remember anything about going to school or anything that happened at school. But after school got over, I remember sitting in the middle section of the van and waiting till it was just the three and the driver. I asked him to tell them about the incident, and his reply was, “What incident?”. I tried to remind him and shared all the details, but he just stared at me with a blank face.

I was genuinely stunned. I began to contemplate my existence as Timothy started to call me a liar and was laughing at me hysterically. Oddly, Ava was actively trying to change the topic and divert our attention. I remember staring at the driver for a very long time and him again not trying to make any eye contact with me.

After that, things get a bit foggy. I have faint memories of getting out of the van and having lunch with my father. He could feel something was wrong, but he didn’t pressure me to tell me what had happened.

But I vividly remember that he got a call from the van driver. On the call, the driver informed him that he could no longer pick me up or drop me off at my home. When my father asked him why, the driver said that his van had broken down and he had replaced it with a new one that could only accommodate a maximum of six kids. Before hanging up, the driver gave my father contact info for the new driver who would from tomorrow come and pick me up. The driver also shared that Timothy is also getting shifted with me.

This sudden call slightly weirded out my father, but he didn’t think much about it. I, on the other hand, was freaking out with everything which was happening. I remember that after my father had gone inside his office/room, I left the home without even leaving a note on the fridge.

The next thing I recall is riding my bike next to the trolley line. Alone. The thoughts of the dead man consumed me. I had to prove to myself that I was not hallucinating him. I cycled at an alarmingly high speed towards the location of the incident.

When I reached the location, there was no blood on the road or on the pavement where I last remembered the man. Then, I rushed inside the fancy grocery store and asked the cashier if he had heard about a man who had recently died next to the store. I gave him all the details but didn’t tell him I was there. Instead, I told him that I had overheard about it on the street.

“Well, let me tell you, kid, nothing like that happened here. I wish it had; honestly, ‘cause at least the mass hysterical created by this... ‘Sponge-Man’ would’ve brought more customers like you to the shop. And kid, word of advice: don’t believe what randos say in public. Most of them have no idea or control over what they say. Now that we’re clear on that, how ‘bout you pick something up from the shop?”

The shopkeeper was very persuasive and made me buy a Yoohoo with my allowance. After I left the shop, I was convinced that somehow I had dreamt about the entire man and the incident. I got back on my bike to head home. The trolley tracks were empty, but out of nowhere, a black car came speeding up behind me and slammed into my bike, throwing me several feet forward.

I was heavily bruised, and my eyes were teary. My body was overall fine, but I had a little concussion. When my mind started to work properly, I remember the black car standing next to me with its window down. The car driver looked at me from top to bottom and asked me, “Are you okay?”

I don’t know why, but I nodded.

“You should be more careful, kid; navigating this world of adults ain’t easy.” the driver said in a very passive-aggressive tone before driving away. I don’t recall any physical features of the man.

There was no one in the surroundings to help me, so I had to help myself. It took me more than ten minutes to process what had happened and resume riding back home. When I got back, my father was not in his office; he was in the living room waiting for me.

I remember him washing my wounds with an antiseptic while scolding me for leaving without a note and ‘crashing my bike in a pole.’ He didn’t take any disciplinary action, but he still restricted my cycle time.

And after that, nothing really interesting happened. I started to go to school in a new van with Timothy, where we made new friends. We slowly started to get much closer to them, and our friendship with Ava just sort of broke. The last time I remember having fun with her was at my ninth birthday party. She didn’t even call when Timothy died last year... And this is the reason why I have started to investigate this case.

For a very long time, I tried my best to convince myself that my mind was just playing tricks on me. But as I grew older, I started to notice suspicious things that happened that my younger self didn’t realize.

●  Ava acting strange(not wanting to go to the location of the incident, not making fun of me when I was proven ’wrong’, and actively trying to change the topic).

●  The driver acting strange(saying, “What incident?” and then kicking me and Timothy out of the van but not Ava).

●  the shopkeeper(I don’t recall anything suspicious, but he was really good with words).

●  And the black car driver(crashing into my cycle on an empty road, the passive-aggressive statement).

I have lost countless hours thinking about this case ever since Timothy died, and the more that I think about it, the more convinced I am that something really happened.

I am currently trying to get in contact with Ava and the driver. I will make subsequent posts updating you guys on this case.

I don’t know who the dead man was. I don’t know if he was good or bad. Heck, I am not even 100% sure that he is real.

But I do know that he is not the only person to suffer that horrid fate... Timothy suffered that same fate, too.

I want to share more details, but unfortunately, this post is already too big, and I don’t have a lot of time. I will make a new post when I get in contact with Ava and the driver. Till then, stay safe.
