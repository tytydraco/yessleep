It’s me again. I don’t even know why I’m writing this anymore. Maybe it’s because I feel like I’m losing myself, and this is all I have left to hold onto. Maybe I’m hoping someone out there has answers—*any* answers—because I sure as hell don’t. If you didn't catch my first post then you can find it here.

Things are getting worse. Every time I fall asleep, Hell feels… closer. It’s not just a place I go when I dream anymore. It’s bleeding into my waking life. The smells, the whispers, the *things* I see out of the corner of my eye—they’re following me back. And Lucifer… he’s showing me things now. Things that make me wish I could claw out my own eyes just to unsee them.

I don’t know how much longer I can do this. If anyone knows how to stop this—how to break free—please help me.

Hell is alive. That’s the only way I can describe it. It’s not a static place with fixed rules or boundaries—it shifts and morphs every time I go back, like it’s responding to me. Like it knows me.

The wasteland where it all started is still there, but now it feels like just one layer of something much larger and infinitely more horrifying. A few nights ago, I found myself in a massive canyon carved into the blackened ground. The walls were made of flesh—pale and veined, with open sores that oozed black ichor—and they pulsed faintly, like they were breathing.

I didn’t want to touch them, but as I walked deeper into the canyon, the walls seemed to close in around me. That’s when I noticed them—the faces embedded in the flesh. At first, they were hard to make out, but as my eyes adjusted to the dim red light of Hell’s eternal sky, they became clearer: twisted expressions of agony frozen in place, mouths open in silent screams.

I tried not to look at them, but some of them had eyes that moved—eyes that followed me as I passed by. Others wept blood that dripped down the fleshy walls and pooled on the ground below, mixing with the black ichor that seeped from the sores.

I thought about turning back, but there was no point. There’s never any point in Hell—it doesn’t let you leave until it wants you to.

That was when something reached out for me.

A hand burst through the wall—a grotesque thing with too many fingers and nails that were jagged and blackened like broken glass. It grabbed my arm before I could react, its grip cold and slimy like dead fish skin. When I yanked myself free, it left behind a burning mark on my forearm—a symbol that looked like an eye with a slit pupil.

I stumbled backward, clutching my arm as pain radiated through it. Before I could catch my breath, the walls began to shift again—the faces twisting into new shapes as if they were laughing at me—and then everything went dark.

When I woke up in my bed, drenched in sweat and gasping for air, the mark was still there.

I didn’t have time to process what had happened before Lucifer appeared again during my next descent into Hell.

He was waiting for me at the edge of a cliff overlooking what he called “the heart of Hell.” It wasn’t a place—it was more like an absence of place. There was no ground beneath our feet, no sky above our heads—just an infinite void filled with swirling shadows and flickering lights that moved like fireflies trapped in glass jars.

“This is where it all begins,” Lucifer said as he gestured around us with one hand. “And where it all ends.”

His voice was calm, almost casual, but there was something beneath it—something ancient and cold that made my skin crawl.

“What do you mean?” I asked hesitantly.

He didn’t answer right away. Instead, he snapped his fingers, and suddenly we were back in the wasteland where we’d first met—but something had changed.

The creatures that usually stalked me kept their distance now, bowing their heads as Lucifer passed by like obedient dogs afraid to anger their master.

“They know better than to challenge me,” he said when he noticed my confusion. “But you… you’re still learning.”

Before I could respond, he reached out and brushed his fingers against my forehead—just barely touching me—and everything changed.

In an instant, I saw *everything*. Not just Hell but everything connected to it: souls being dragged down into its depths; demons clawing their way up into our world; entire cities consumed by darkness as people screamed for help that would never come.

It lasted only a second—maybe less—but when he pulled his hand away, my legs gave out beneath me. I collapsed to my knees, gasping for air as tears streamed down my face.

“Consider this a gift,” Lucifer said softly before disappearing into the crimson haze without another word.

I thought Lucifer was the worst thing in Hell… but I was wrong.

A few nights ago, while wandering through what looked like a massive graveyard filled with bones taller than skyscrapers, I encountered something else—something older than Lucifer himself.

At first, I thought it was just another shadow moving at the edge of my vision—a trick of Hell’s ever-shifting landscape—but then it stepped into view: a towering figure cloaked entirely in darkness. Its form shifted constantly like smoke caught in a breeze, and its face—or what passed for a face—was featureless except for two glowing white eyes that pierced through the gloom.

When it spoke, its voice wasn’t a sound—it was a feeling. It resonated inside my chest like a second heartbeat or a low hum vibrating through my bones.

“You should not be here,” it said—or rather *impressed* upon me.

“I don’t want to be here,” I replied shakily.

The figure tilted its head slightly as if studying me. “You are marked,” it said after a long pause. “Bound by His will.”

“Lucifer?” My voice cracked as fear clawed its way up my throat.

The figure didn’t respond directly but instead extended one shadowy hand toward me. In its palm (if you could call it that), an image appeared—a vision of myself standing beside Lucifer as flames consumed everything around us.

“You will serve,” it said simply before dissolving into nothingness.

When I woke up again in my bed, shaking and drenched in sweat, there was no mark this time… but somehow that felt worse.

Lucifer keeps asking for more favors—each one darker than the last—but this time felt different from the start.

He appeared behind me during one of my descents into Hell with his usual cold smile and empty eyes and handed me a small black box sealed with wax and covered in symbols that hurt my eyes to look at.

“Leave this at St. Mary’s,” he said simply before vanishing again without waiting for an answer.

St. Mary’s is an abandoned church downtown—a crumbling relic of another time—and when I left the box on its steps late that night under cover of darkness, something shifted behind me: a low growl followed by the sound of claws scraping against stone.

I turned around slowly… but there was nothing there.

That night in Hell was worse than any before it—the creatures bolder now than ever—and Lucifer seemed more amused by my suffering than ever before. He says he’s preparing me for something bigger but won’t tell me what that is… only that “it will all make sense soon.”

I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this. It’s not just the nights anymore. Hell is bleeding into my days, into *me*. I can feel it in my skin, in my mind, in the way people look at me like they know something’s wrong but can’t quite put their finger on it. I think it’s the mark—the one that thing burned into my arm. It’s doing something to me.

I don’t even feel like myself anymore. My thoughts aren’t my own. My reflection isn’t my own. And Lucifer… he knows. He watches me like a predator waiting for its prey to stop struggling.

If anyone out there is reading this, please—*please*—tell me what to do. I’m scared of what I’m becoming.

It started with the mark.

At first, it was just a scar—a strange, circular burn on my forearm that looked like an eye with a slit pupil. It was tender to the touch, but I figured it would heal eventually. Except… it didn’t. Instead, it started to change.

A week after I got it, the skin around the mark began to darken, turning an ashy gray that spread outward like cracks in dry earth. Sometimes it felt hot, like someone was pressing a branding iron against my skin, and other times it felt ice-cold, making my entire arm go numb.

But the worst part wasn’t the pain—it was what happened when I looked at it too long.

The mark… *moved*. Not physically—I couldn’t see it shifting—but when I stared at it for more than a few seconds, I’d start to feel dizzy, like the world around me was tilting sideways. Shadows would creep in at the edges of my vision, and sometimes I’d hear whispers—soft voices murmuring things I couldn’t understand but somehow knew were meant for me.

And then there were the dreams—or maybe they weren’t dreams at all.

One morning, after another sleepless night of pacing my apartment and trying to stay awake, I caught a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror—and for a moment, I didn’t recognize the person staring back at me.

It wasn’t that I looked different—not exactly—but there was something *off* about my reflection. My eyes seemed darker, deeper, like they were pulling light into them instead of reflecting it. My skin looked paler than usual, almost translucent under the harsh fluorescent light. And then there was my smile—or rather, the smile that wasn’t mine.

I wasn’t smiling. My face was blank with exhaustion and fear—but in the mirror, my reflection’s lips curled upward ever so slightly, just enough to show teeth that were sharper than they should have been.

I stumbled back from the sink and blinked hard, and when I looked again, everything was normal—or as normal as things could be under the circumstances.

But after that… people started noticing.

It’s subtle at first—the way people react to you when something about you isn’t quite right. They don’t say anything outright; they just… look at you differently.

My coworkers started avoiding me in the break room at work. Conversations would stop abruptly when I walked in, and people would glance at me out of the corners of their eyes like they were afraid to meet my gaze directly.

Even strangers on the street seemed uneasy around me. Mothers pulled their children closer as I passed by; dogs barked or whimpered when they saw me; cashiers fumbled with change as if their hands had suddenly forgotten how to work properly.

And then there were the shadows.

At first, I thought they were just tricks of the light—dark shapes flickering at the edges of my vision or stretching unnaturally long across walls and ceilings—but now I’m not so sure. Sometimes they move when nothing else does—slithering along surfaces like living things—and sometimes they whisper.

They don’t speak words—not ones I can understand anyway—but their voices are low and guttural, like growls mixed with static. And they’re always saying *something*, always directed at me.

Lucifer noticed the changes too—or maybe he caused them in the first place. Either way, he seemed amused by them.

“You’re coming along nicely,” he said during one of our nightly encounters in Hell. We were standing on a bridge made of bones that stretched over a river of molten gold—gold that screamed as it flowed beneath us.

“What’s happening to me?” I demanded, clutching my arm where the mark still burned faintly beneath my skin.

Lucifer tilted his head slightly, his empty black eyes glinting with something that might have been amusement—or hunger. “You’re evolving,” he said simply. “Becoming what you were always meant to be.”

“I don’t want this,” I said through gritted teeth.

He chuckled softly—a sound that echoed unnaturally through Hell’s twisted landscape. “Want has nothing to do with it,” he said before gesturing toward the horizon where massive spires of black obsidian rose into a sky filled with swirling crimson clouds. “This is your destiny now.”

I wanted to argue—to scream at him—but before I could say anything else, he snapped his fingers and we were somewhere else entirely: a cathedral made entirely of glass that reflected endless versions of myself back at me from every angle.

“This is what you are,” Lucifer said as he gestured toward one of the reflections—a version of me with blackened eyes and jagged teeth who smiled back at me with cold malice. “And this is what you will become.”

I thought Lucifer was bad enough—but then there was *it*.

A few nights ago—after another favor Lucifer demanded (this time leaving an ancient-looking dagger buried beneath an oak tree in a park)—I encountered something else in Hell: a creature unlike anything I’d seen before.

It stood taller than any human should be—at least ten feet—with elongated limbs that ended in sharp claws instead of hands or feet. Its skin was pale and translucent like wax paper stretched too thin over jagged bones beneath, and its face was hidden beneath a hood made from what looked like human skin stitched together haphazardly with black thread.

When it spoke (if you could call it speaking), its voice sounded like dozens of whispers layered on top of each other—a chorus of voices all saying different things at once but somehow forming coherent sentences.

“You are His pawn,” it said—or rather whispered—in unison. “But pawns can become kings.”

Before I could ask what it meant—or why its words sent chills down my spine—the cathedral began to collapse around us: walls shattering into shards of glass that rained down like knives while flames erupted from beneath the floor—and then everything went black again.

I woke up screaming again this morning—with blood dripping from my nose and ears—and now even *I* can see how much worse things have gotten.

My reflection doesn’t match me anymore; shadows follow me wherever I go; people avoid me like they can sense what’s inside me… or what’s taking over.

If anyone out there knows how to stop this—how to break free from Lucifer or undo whatever this mark is doing to me—please tell me before it’s too late.

Because if this keeps going… I don’t think there’ll be anything left of *me* soon.
