  It happened around 15:00. The day was cloudy, yet bright. I have no idea what i just witnessed.

  My neighbor the other side of the street lives in a rundown house. Not a very old creepy place, would look quite good if taken better care of, but as it stands it has some cracks on the walls, paint peeling off here and there, and lots of overgrowth around it. The neighbor keeps to himself, never heard much noise from there. All is always quiet at my neighbor's home. Yesterday, however, there was a racket. Around 23:00 or so, i heard pans being thrown, glass breaking, screaming. Afterwards, silence.

  Today, a car hastily pulled up in front of my neighbor's house. A man ran out of the car, screaming my neighbor's name in a worried tone, a baseball bat in hand. The man started hitting the walls of the residence, yelling for him to come out. 

  “Get out of there, man! I’m right outside, just fucking run!”

  He tapped on the windows, knocked on the door, turned around to the street, yelled some more, asking for "help". The street is pretty empty at this time, very few cars passing by, nobody went out to check. I just watched from my window.

  I heard the man scream again, scared. A woman's face suddenly plopped at the window, abnormally large, pale skin, black hair. The man started hitting the bat against the sidewalk, telling the woman to come out, threatening her. He hit the door of the house a few times with the bat, the woman opened it. A long, skinny, spider like appendage awkwardly beckoned the man in, shyly poking out of the doorway.

  "Knock closer", i heard the thing whisper, in a somewhat soothing, ethereal, voice.

  The man screamed for it to stay away. He pleaded for someone to come out and help him. I saw him run down the street, away from the house. Some cars passed by, but paid very little notice to the man. The thing peaked its head outside, it being almost too big to pass through the door. Now, save for some kids playing in the distance, nobody was outside besides the man. Before i could make sense of what was happening, the thing had moved, way too fast to follow. I only saw a silhouette, big, swiftly crawling down the street. The man, almost a block down at this point, got taken. Dead silence.

  The thing, as fast as it went out, got back inside. The door closed, gently. I could only sit there, trying to process what had just happened. 

  Eventually, heavier traffic and pedestrian movement started, commuters getting back from work. Few more people came and went to check on my neighbor’s house, knocked on the door, tapped on the windows. The door always opened, the thing always beckoned. They all left, though. All terrified, however.

  The woman had just been peeking outside the doorway. 23:00, the street is empty. All is quiet at my neighbor's house.
