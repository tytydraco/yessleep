I am the OP's best friend, I will try to explain what happened to him as best as I can.

I was very familiar with my friend's tape situation because he sent me messages while watching them, he advised me to visit him only if he stops sending me messages. 

Unfortunately, soon after he finished the fifth tape, he stopped texting me.

I rushed to his home and used the hidden spare key to open the door.

What I saw has chilled me to the bone, my friend was laying on the ground and was almost unrecognizable, he looked like a bloody pile of minced meat instead of a human being, oddly enough he seemed to be alive, the lumpy flesh was vibrating and softly groaning in pain.

Before I could even process what was happening, I saw his phone on the ground, the screen was slightly cracked, but It was still usable, the notes app was running, in bold letters, a warning was written.

"I CAN STILL BE SAVED. DO NOT CALL ANYONE, OPEN THE NOTES AND FIND THE INSTRUCTIONS, FOLLOW THEM CLOSELY, DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO MY CURRENT CONDITION, IT WILL ONLY DISTRACT YOU!"

The warning confused me, but I would never doubt my friend's advice, I ignored the influx of emotions and quickly did as I was told. 

On the phone I found a note labeled as "Tape Instructions".

I opened it and found some instructions and a detailed description of the sixth tape.

The instructions were long and very detailed, I'll try to post the shortened version of the instructions and tape transcription as soon as I can. What I can tell you without revealing too much is that this tape six is unique and far more dangerous than the tapes that came before it.

I read everything three times and was determined to follow out the instructions, my first reaction was "Holy shit, this tape is rigged!"

I looked at the old TV and the VCR with a box of tapes sitting next to it, before starting the sixth tape, I looked around the room and found a good pair of headphones on the sofa, "This will do." I whispered to myself.

Finally I connected the headphones to my own phone and started playing a long Linkin Park playlist, I put the headphones on and increased the volume as much as I could.

You're probably thinking I'm crazy because instead of trying to call the ambulance and help my friend, I choose to listen to my favorite band and watch the sixth tape. 

Trust me, after reading the tape transcription and instructions, I now understand that if I really want to save my friend, this is the only way to do it. I'm glad I read the transcription of the tape, because I now know what will happen, which gives me an advantage my friend unfortunately didn't have.

I will now start the sixth tape now, I will take my friend's role and try to transcribe what's happening, although since I read my friend's warning, I already know exactly what's on it.

Without any further delay, I put the tape in the VCR and hit "PLAY".

*Tape 6: Witch Doctor, begins.*

*A pearl white room is shown, inside it there's only one piece of furniture, a white armchair.*

*A tall man is sitting on the armchair, he's wearing a dark blue suit with a matching tie, a black top hat sits on his head, but it's extremely small, It looks to be the size of a coffee mug. The mysterious man's skin is pale, so pale that I imagined it would almost blend in with the walls of the room if he wasn't wearing any clothes.*

*He looks sickly, yet full of energy, even though he seemed to be severely malnourished, a huge smile was plastered on his bony face.*

*His gray eyes looked like they were staring directly at me.*

*If I didn't read my friend's transcription of the tape beforehand, I'd probably be confused, but instead of confusion I feel fear.*

*This is the man that turned my friend into a blob of flesh in the time span of no more than ten minutes, if I make one tiny mistake or my plan simply fails, I have no doubt I will end up in the same position as my friend is in.*

*The pale man gets up and waves with his thin right hand.*

*What comes next will either be my demise or a chance to save my friend, I have around two minutes to prepare for that moment, for now I'll end this part here.*
