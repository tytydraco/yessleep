Being a new dad was harder than I expected. The sleepless nights, the constant worry, and the sheer responsibility weighed on me in ways I never imagined. But no matter how tired I was, I couldn’t resist checking the baby monitor every few minutes, just to make sure everything was okay with our little Emily. It became a habit, almost an obsession, to have that monitor on hand, always listening for any signs of distress.



One night, after yet another exhausting day, I dozed off on the couch with the baby monitor by my side. The house was eerily quiet, save for the occasional creak of the old floorboards. In my half-asleep state, I heard it—a soft, almost soothing voice coming through the monitor. At first, I thought I was dreaming, but as the voice continued, I realized with growing dread that this was real. The voice wasn’t mine, and it definitely wasn’t my wife’s. It was low and raspy, yet somehow calm, like someone who had been whispering for centuries. “Don’t worry, I’m watching her,” the voice said.



My heart raced as I shot up from the couch. The voice was so clear, as if someone was in the room with my daughter. I bolted upstairs, my pulse pounding in my ears. I flung open the door to her nursery, expecting the worst. But when I got there, Emily was sound asleep in her crib, her little chest rising and falling peacefully. There was no one else in the room, no signs of anything out of the ordinary. The baby monitor was silent, no trace of the voice that had chilled me to the bone.



The next night, I couldn’t sleep at all. I sat in the nursery, staring at the monitor, waiting for something to happen. Hours passed, and nothing did. Just as I was beginning to think I had imagined the whole thing, the voice came again, this time more insistent. “She’s mine now,” it whispered. The monitor suddenly went dead, the screen flickering to black. I leaped to my feet, my mind racing with terror. I rushed to the crib, but when I looked inside, my heart stopped—Emily was gone.



The police were called, and a frantic search ensued, but they never found her. They couldn’t explain how she had disappeared without a trace, with all the doors and windows locked. The only evidence left behind was the baby monitor, now silent and cold. But every night, I still hear that voice, taunting me, reminding me of what I lost. “She’s mine now,” it says, over and over again, until I’m driven to the edge of madness.



I can’t bring myself to get rid of the monitor. It’s the only connection I have left to Emily, even if it’s haunted by whatever took her. Some nights, I stay up, hoping against hope that I’ll hear her cry, that somehow she’ll come back. But all I ever hear is that voice, and it’s slowly driving me insane. I don’t know how much longer I can take this. I just want my daughter back, but deep down, I know she’s gone, and there’s nothing I can do to bring her back.
