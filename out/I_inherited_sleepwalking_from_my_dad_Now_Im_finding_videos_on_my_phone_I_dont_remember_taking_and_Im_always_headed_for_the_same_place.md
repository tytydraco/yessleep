This is a bit of an odd one, but stay with me. 

Some background first—when I was about eleven, my dad killed himself. It was horrible, sure, but not exactly surprising. He never spelled it out, but his childhood sounded pretty horrible, and whatever he dragged out of that hellhole followed him into adulthood. I wasn’t there when it happened—if the town gossip is to be believed—when my mum found him, she took a long drag on her ciggie, blew smoke toward the ceiling and muttered to the constable, deadpan as anything: “Figures he’d go out like his dad.” 

Cold, yes. But technically accurate. He did top himself in the exact same way his dad did. 

Then about eight years later, my older brother followed suit. Eleven months after that, my uncle. Both of his sons, too, eventually—though I wasn’t close to my cousins, so I couldn’t tell you when exactly they clocked out. It was just something I learnt of months or years after the fact, after bumping into some mutual acquaintance in the grocery store and it was mentioned in passing.

Suicide clusters happen, right? It’s a thing. Some psychologist somewhere would probably say it was environmental or neurological or some fancy combination of both—poke around our grey matter and pin it all on some rogue gene or deeply ingrained trauma. Stamp a tidy little explanation on the mess and call it a day. 

That’s what I thought, anyway. Seemed logical. Made sense.  

I’d argue misery’s the default setting for most men—especially when there aren’t enough distractions to drown it out. My family lived remote for generations—miners, mostly—and if the Sunday markets or drinking by the creek isn’t your thing, there was sweet fuck-all else to do. Let’s just say there’s a reason our town of roughly eight hundred people is considered the ice capitol of Western Australia. 

I’m telling you this because that’s the theory I clung to for years. Why the men in my family kept dropping like flies. We were just a long line of blokes raised hard by mothers who were too exhausted to love properly, and fathers who were either working or already dead. So far removed from anything resembling connection that the isolation—that insulation—settled on us like dust. That feeling of being small, inconsequential, stuck. It wears you down. Inherited misery. Plain and simple. 

So, anyway. I turned seventeen, dropped out of school. My grades were shit, and every day I’d drive past the open pit at the Carbanak Resources Iron Mine and feel like if I didn’t move—didn’t do something—I’d end up at the bottom of it. So I left. Reached out to a cousin on my mum’s side I barely knew, who was looking for flatmates while she studied. Figured, why not. Gotta break the cycle somehow. 

And I did. Or I thought I did. 

About three months ago, I woke up standing in the middle of the bush.  

Now, there were a few odd things about this. 

One: it’s fucking disconcerting to wake up and not be in your bed—especially when you’re ninety percent sure that’s where you started. 

Two: I live in metropolitan Melbourne. Suburbia. Public transport. Good coffee. If you see a possum, it’s in a wheelie bin. And suddenly, I’m in the *bush* bush. 

I’m talking paperbarks and gums. Midgies going to town on me like I’m the best thing they’ve tasted in years. The ground’s water-starved and rough, my bare feet are shredded, and I’m one unlucky step away from a funnel web or something blowing a gasket in my ankle. Phone was dead.  

Took me almost two hours to stumble by way onto a highway, sweat-soaked and still in my pyjamas, before some trucker took pity on me and gave me a lift to the nearest petrol station where I had to borrow the clerks phone to ask my cousin for a lift.  

And listen—because I’m open to being told I’m crazy—I’ll level with you. I’d had a fair bit to drink the afternoon before. Not blackout or anything, but enough that the tail-end of the night’s a bit fuzzy. I remember taking dozens of photos in a photobooth—still have those pictures somewhere, my arms draped around people whose names I don't remember.

So that was my best guess: that drunk-me had gone wandering, maybe chasing a late-night kebab (wouldn’t be the first time), misjudged the direction entirely and just kept going. 

Only thing is, when I retraced the route later—by car—it would’ve taken me nearly six and a half hours on foot to get to where I woke up. Through bushland. No tracks. No roads. No clearings. Just scrub. 

Any other guy, any other family history, I might’ve called myself a bit of a legend and had a good laugh about it with my friends. Only, that day, when I woke up in the bush, I was so terrified I was *cold*, even staggering back in forty-degree heat.  

Because I’d seen this before. 

My dad used to do the same thing.

Towards the end—before he slung a length of rope over the steel beam in the shed and decided to see if he could fly—Dad would wander off all the time. 

Got to the point where Mum, who’d been sick of his shit for the better part of twelve years, just started leaving the back door propped open with an old shoe. Easier that way. Less banging when he tried to shoulder it open at dawn. 

Sometimes I’d be halfway through my Weetabix when he’d stumble back in, covered in dirt or leaves with this look on his face. He wouldn’t talk to me—he wasn't much for talking, full stop—he’d just head straight for the shower. 

I was young—he died when I was twelve—so I didn’t think much of it at the time. Just Dad being Dad. Bit weird. Bit cooked. Part of the background noise of childhood. 

It wasn’t until I got older that I realised what that expression was. That pinched, hollowed-out look he wore as he left bloody footprints down the hallway. Fear. I’m not talking jump-scare fear. I’m talking bone-deep, soul-wrung, world-ending terror. 

So, after my little excursion, I started keeping tabs on myself. Nothing serious—just made a point of plugging my phone in before bed, setting the location tracker, that sort of thing. I also tried to remind myself that correlation doesn't equal causation or however the fuck that phrase goes. Just because I might’ve inherited this quirk from my dad, who ended up offing himself, didn’t necessarily mean I was destined to go off and off myself too. 

But then it happened again.   
   
A few times, actually. 

The next time, I woke up in the middle of a freeway about thirty kilometres west of the city. Headlights flashing past either side of me. Four AM. Wearing mismatched shoes and my cousin's university hoodie, which I hadn’t seen since we moved in together. No memory. Not a whisper. Just the sick certainty that I’d walked there. On foot. No phone, again. Only reason I got back was some tradie on his pre-dawn commute took pity on me. 

Then there was the time I woke up in someone’s backyard. Suburban, manicured, silent. A child’s swing set creaking gently in the breeze. It was still dark, but the porch light flicked on while I was getting my bearings and this middle-aged woman in a dressing gown stepped out, saw me, and dropped her cup of tea. Just shattered it on the concrete like something out of a movie. I mumbled something—no idea what—and legged it.  

Booked in with a sleep specialist, took a look at the prices, cancelled it. Upped my melatonin intake, worked out like crazy to make sure I was dog-tired every time my head hit that pillow. Sometimes it helped, most times it didn’t.  

One time—this would've been about three weeks ago now—I woke up in the hallway of my flat. I’d returned home, somehow. Front door wide open, cold air pooling on the tiles like something had just come in or gone out. My breath was visible. My feet were wet. 

It was 3:12 AM. 

I didn’t remember getting up. Didn’t remember unlocking anything. I did the usual: checked my hands, checked the soles of my feet. Looked for blood, mud, ink. Nothing. Just the weird, hollow headache I was starting to associate with these episodes. And the feeling. That pressing. Like I’d missed a step going down the stairs and my guts were still catching up. 

I staggered back to bed. Slept like shit. It wasn’t until this morning that I noticed the notification. Storage Almost Full. Which was weird, because I’m not a big photo guy, hate being in them. Checked my gallery. 

There are hundreds of videos. I’m talking hours of them. 

All recent.   
All filmed with the front-facing camera.   
All of me. 

Just walking. Long stretches of nothing—quiet suburban streets, grassy reserves, the shoulder of a dark highway. And there I am, in frame the whole time, my own face staring back at the camera like I’m vlogging some existential crisis I can’t be arsed to narrate. No talking. Barely blinking. Just walking , all alone, and filming myself. 

Sometimes there’s a glint in my eye—like recognition. Like I’m listening to something. At times, I smile.

And here’s the odd part. If you scrub through the footage slowly—frame by frame—you start to see things. Not often. But they’re there. 

A shadow moving behind me in a place where there’s no light. A reflection in a window that doesn’t match my movements.  

And once—just once—you can see a shape behind me. In the distance. Far back. Like a tall man. Or not a man. Wearing something like a coat, but not quite right. Too long. Too thin. Arms down at its sides like they’re waiting to be used. You scrub too fast, and it’s gone. 

About two weeks ago, I called Mum. 

We don’t really talk. Not because she’s a bad person—she’s not, exactly. Not a good one either. Just someone wired entirely different to me. Her brand of love is the tough kind. If there’s softness in her, it’s buried deep beneath decades of not having the time or permission to show it. 

Anyway, I recorded our call. I had a feeling I might need to refer back to it. What follows is the exact transcription. Word for word. 

Setting the scene: she’d just spent a solid ten minutes unloading about Annee (my sister) getting sacked from her hairdressing apprenticeship—*“too soft, too slow, never had the follow-through”*—and I finally steered the conversation where I needed it to go. 

>**Me:** Mum, I’m sorry but I gotta talk about about dad for a bit. 

>**Mum:** Why would you wanna do that?

>**Me:** I’m starting to sleepwalk. 

>*She went real quiet for a moment. Sorry, I’m editorialising.* 

>**Mum:** Jesus. 

>**Me:** I’m getting it checked out. 

>**Mum:** Yeah?  

>**Me:** Yeah. 

>**Mum:** Between you and your brother— 

>**Me:** Hang on, what? *‘S’* had this, too? 

>**Mum:** Of course. You don’t remember him walking into your room some nights? Scared the absolute shit outta you— 

>**Me**: I was too young to remember, I guess. 

>**Mum:** Well, he did. Him and your father, both. 

>**Me:** Anyone else? 

>**Mum:** <silence> 

>**Me:** Please, mum, anyone else? 

>**Mum:** <silence> 

>**Me:** Mum— 

>**Mum:** I don’t want you jumping to any conclusions. 

>**Me:** I’m not gonna, but did others have this? 

>**Mum:** <silence> 

>**Me:** Did Uncle Andrew sleepwalk? Did his sons—the dead ones, what’re their names—Brayden, William—did they sleepwalk, too? 

>**Mum:** Yes. 

>**Me:** Jesus. Jesus Christ. And you never connected the dots—? 

>**Mum:** Connected what, *‘R’?* What is there to fuckin’ connect, I mean *really*. That sickness runs through the veins of the men in this family? Everyone knows that. It’s a shit hand you’ve been dealt, pet, but you’ve got a good head on your shoulders and you’ve not been getting any bad thoughts? 

>**Me:** I don’t want to kill myself, if that’s what you mean. 

>**Mum:** There you go, already a step beyond the rest. 

>**Me:** What bad thoughts, though? Did dad, did *‘S’* ever say— 

>**Mum:** I don’t wanna talk about this, *R.* 

>**Me:** Well, mum, I do ‘cause I’m pretty fuckin’ scared— 

>**Mum:** Don’t use that fucking tone with me. I don’t want you going off and looking into this stupid shit like your brother did, because diseased minds will cling to whatever conspiracy they can find, R, and I’m done fuckin’ burying my boys— 

>**Me:** What stuff? Did you say *‘S’* was— 

She hung up on me after that. Texted me a couple minutes later that she loved me, but that I’d upset her, and she was going for a lie down.  

Weird, right? And she’s let trip that my brother, who killed himself in his early twenties when I was fourteen, had been looking into it. Which suggested there was *something* to look into. 

So, I spent the next few days tracking down my aunt, and the widows of my two deceased cousins. Mum apparently got to my aunt first, she was tight lipped and told me I’d only make myself more crook by filling my head with crazy ideas—but the widows were more forthcoming, perhaps without any of that generational loyalty to hold them back. 

The stories were almost identical. Same pattern. First came the sleepwalking. Then came the filming. Both Brayden and William had hours of footage—just like mine. Shaky, low-light videos of themselves wandering aimlessly through the night, flash on, eyes reduced to glowing white orbs devoid of pupils, mouths slack.  

Now, hereditary sleepwalking? Sure. I’ll bite. Maybe it runs in families. Some weird quirk in the brain. You could probably dig up a journal article or two, slap a name on it, call it benign. 

But the filming? What element of your DNA is supposed to teach you to *pick up a phone and point it at your own face while unconscious?* That’s not muscle memory. That’s not evolution. That’s something else. 

And there was another thing. 

Neither Brayden nor William ever left town. They lived at home until the end. So when they sleepwalked, they always ended up in the same place: the *Carbanak Resources Iron Mine.*  

Every single time. 

That stuck with me. Got me wondering. 

So I pulled up Google Maps and started plotting out my own movements—every time my phone had recorded a walk, every midnight stroll I didn’t remember. I marked them all, measured headings, compared directions, laid them one over the other. 

Every single path pointed the same way. Not close. Not approximately. Exactly. Same vector. Same bearing.

Draw a straight line across the continent along that heading and you know where it lands? 

Dead centre of the *Carbanak Iron Mine.* 

Thousands of kilometres away. 

And somehow, without ever having been there, without ever seeing the place properly in my life, I’ve been trying to walk there in my sleep. 

Tell me how the fuck that’s supposed to be genetic. 

I asked the widows if they remembered anything else—any other signs, any other oddities. They hesitated at first, like they weren’t sure what counted, or maybe they’d spent so long trying to forget that dredging it back up felt wrong. 

But then the memories started to surface. 

They both said the same thing: their husbands hated being photographed. Not just camera shy—*hated it.* Something about the act itself would set them off. Brayden once smacked the phone out of his wife’s hand at their daughter’s third birthday. She was trying to film him singing over the cake. One second, he was fine, the next he was snarling, eyes wide, like she’d just shone a torch in the face of something buried deep underground. The phone shattered on the tiles. The kid started crying. 

William, apparently, went even further. He smashed every phone in the house. Every single one. Said they were watching him. Wouldn’t say who “they” were. Refused to buy his wife—then a stay-at-home mother—a replacement.

But the part that really stuck with me—William’s daughter, a little older by then, told her mum one day that her Polaroid camera had gone missing. Few days later, William found it in his own wardrobe. Inside, in an old shoebox, were hundreds of Polaroids. Hundreds. Crammed in like he was hoarding them. 

Almost all of them were photos of William. 

Unflattering angles. Off-centre, held at arms length.

The widow said she asked him—had he taken them? Were they some kind of weird art project or surveillance thing? 

But William looked like he was about to throw up. Not angry, not embarrassed. Scared. She said he acted like someone had broken into their home and left a box of photos behind. Like he couldn’t remember a single one. Like they weren’t his at all. 

Brayden never found anything like that, but he did say something once—just once, in a moment of clarity his wife said didn’t happen often by the end. They were talking about his dad, and his granddad before him. Both gone, both suicides. And Brayden had this far-off look in his eyes when he muttered it. 

“He was the first, you know. My granddad. The first in our line to do it.” 

She asked if he meant suicide. Brayden had said yes. Then added: 

‘Shouldn’t have taken that photo. Took the equipment down special. First time any of them had ever seen a camera, you know, or whatever they called it back then.’ Then he repeated: 'Shouldn't have taken that photo.' 

Then she asked what he meant, he said: 

‘Of that thing. Deep in the mines.’ 

He never said more after that. It was the first and last time he ever brought it up. 

A week later, he was gone too. 

And of course—how had I not put it together sooner?

My dad hated having his picture taken, too. 

There was this one time—I must’ve been seven, maybe eight. Won a disposable camera in some end-of-term raffle at school. Came home waving it around like a trophy. Dad walked through the door and I—just being a little idiot revved up on adrenalin—called out “smile, dad!” and clicked the shutter. 

He punched me in the mouth. 

Split my lip clean open. Camera went flying, smashed to bits on the kitchen tiles. I didn’t even cry—just stared at him, stunned. And he grabbed me by the shoulders, eyes wild, and snarled right into my face: “Never take a fuckin’ photo of me. *Ever* again.” 

I’d buried that one. Deep. One of a hundred little unpleasantries I’d filed away under normal childhood bullshit. But it came roaring back as soon as the widows started talking. 

And there was another thing—worse, somehow, because it had been good before it turned bad. 

Flash forward a couple years later. Camcorders were becoming more common. I wanted one so badly. I begged for weeks. Dad was reluctant—shifty, even—but eventually, he caved. Bought one second-hand from a guy at work. 

That summer? That was maybe the happiest I remember him. Us. We took a road trip down south, just the two of us. Stayed in dodgy motels. Ate crap food. Filmed everything. Goofy little scenes. Me doing dumb voices. Him pretending to narrate like a documentary host. It was golden. He was golden.  

And then we got home. 

We sat down to watch the tapes. First one played fine. Second one, too. And then—somewhere in the third—he went completely still. 

I remember the way his jaw slackened. Like something in the footage had reached out and touched him. Like he’d seen a face in the static. 

Then he lost it. 

Smashed the TV. Ripped the camcorder out of the wall and hurled it across the room. Tore the tapes apart with his bare hands. I tried to stop him, tried to ask what was wrong, and he just kept muttering “no, no, no, no” like a prayer. Like maybe if he said it enough times, whatever he’d seen would un-happen. 

We never talked about it. Not once. He acted like the whole summer hadn’t even happened. Like the trip was just some weird dream we both shared and forgot at the same time. 

But I think about it now, and I wonder—what are videos, really? 

A million photographs. One after another. Frame by frame by frame. 

Look—I know how this sounds. 

I do. 

Maybe it’s just a genetic thing. A curse passed down in blood and synapses. Some cracked family line of sleepwalkers with delusions of grandeur. Maybe we’re just born sick, and the sickness makes us search for patterns that aren’t there. 

But I’ve been thinking about filming myself. Properly. Just sitting down, facing the lens, and letting it run through the night. No walking. No GPS. Just me, and the dark, and the eye of the camera. See if it catches anything. See if it sees me. 

Problem is—I’m scared. 

And not just regular scared. It’s something else. I don’t know how to explain it, but the more videos I take, the more photos I find on my phone in the mornings, the longer the blackouts seem to last. Like something’s reaching through them, pulling time out of me. And the strangest part is, every time I wake up, I feel this deep, aching pull to go home. 

So yeah. That’s why I’m posting here. 

If anyone’s heard of something like this—sleepwalking, recurring directional impulses, hereditary aversion to being seen on film—I’d really appreciate anything. Articles. Journals. Even just stories. I’ll take anything at this point. 

Because here’s the crazy part. The bit I haven’t told anyone yet: 

Lately, I’ve been thinking about going back. Back to Carbanak. Not just to visit. To work. I’ve looked into it. There are job listings. Open positions. Labour shortages. It wouldn’t be hard. 

And I know it sounds insane—I know—but something about it feels *right*. There's this pull, navel-deep, and getting stronger every day.

Common sense tells me it's just my mining roots flaring up after a long haitus, my blood wanting to follow family tradition.

Only a little part of me is worried it's not really *me* that wants to go back at all.
