From the safety of my car, I watched fire light up the lake shore. The great manor house, centuries-old, burned hot and violent in the waning dusk light. The lake shimmered against the blaze, reflecting tumbling frames and immolated beams like magma flowing upon the water. The roof collapsed, and smoke like infected stomach bile erupted, staining the sky sick and black.

Firemen surrounded the burning home. One of them approached my car. I rolled the window down.

“Everything alright?” I asked.

“Sir, you need to move along.”

My foot hovered over the brake pedal. Something was off. The firemens’ uniforms were pristine. No ash, no scuff, no wear or tear. The equipment resembled theater props for a play. And none of the crew moved to put out the flames. They all just watched.

“Sir,” the fireman repeated, a command now instead of a request. The man had the cold, steely look of a soldier, of a specialist commissioned to eliminate a threat.

I stared past him, to the home where, less than twenty-four hours ago, I had slept, and at the memory, I shuddered.

Misinterpreting my numb disassociation as disobedience, the fireman edged closer.

“Right,” I mumbled. “Sorry. Stay safe.” 

My foot lifted off the break. The car rumbled down the dirt road. I glanced behind. All I saw was the inferno and the blackened skeleton of the house. No sign of the woman. That should be reassuring, yet even now I worry the fire won’t be enough.

The nightmare started with a doctor’s order and my, admittedly, over enthusiasm for a well-constructed roof. I was blithely sitting on the examination table, awaiting my results, when my doctor knocked and entered. He looked worried. “Blood pressure’s too high, John,” he grunted. “Keep it up like this, and you’re on your way to an early grave.”

I was aghast. I hadn’t even hit thirty yet. Furthermore, my diet was impeccable, and I exercised fastidiously. I insisted the nurse retake my blood pressure.

“Already did,” said the doctor, “Twice, just to be sure.”

I protested, but the doctor cut me off. “Twice,” he repeated. “Look, John, when was the last time you took a vacation?”

I pulled out my phone and scrolled through the calendar app. Class schedules, faculty meetings,  extracurriculars, research in the library, even my bathroom breaks were meticulously laid out. Call it excessive if you want, but completing a PhD in three years requires extraordinary planning. 

“Sixteen months, two weeks and five days”

My doctor seemed offended.  “Jesus, kid.”

“Yes, but I do put aside time for self-care and–”

“Look, take a break alright?”

“But–”

“No but’s. Just relax.” The doctor scribbled onto his RX pad, tore off the page and slapped it into my hand. The script featured a crude drawing of the sun and some waves. “Take a vacation. Then check back in three months, alright?”

“But-“

My doctor spread his arms, mimicking a yoga pose, “Just relax”.

“Right.” Defeated, I stuffed the script into my pocket and walked out.

That night, I examined my schedule. Deadlines approached, and the only time I could reallocate was spring break. Desperate to avoid crowds and boorish drunks, I scanned online for somewhere quiet, and predictably, it was the roof that gave me pause.

Right–explanations. I’m a historian who studies architecture of the past. My thesis examines roofing trends throughout 18th century America. You see, I believe homes reveal something about their designers. And the roof, as the building’s apex, personifies the architect’s efforts to touch the heavens. To me, a roof represents the perfect amalgamation of practical need and wholly superfluous reach.

And I promise you, this roof was a work of art. A mansard design, straight out of the second empire. Round windows, bonneted dormers and stone-carved birds flapping out of the base. Its tiles were mist-gray, reminiscent of interlocked waves storming and gusting in the Atlantic. I was entranced.

And the price was astonishingly affordable. That probably should’ve given me pause, but—a lakeside view in April, all below my budget. It was perfect. And so, to my eternal regret, I input my credit card and clicked ‘Book’.

The hour was late when I arrived. Stepping out of the car, suitcase in hand, I stretched stiff limbs and craned my neck. I took in the night air, and I exhaled. After delays, traffic, and a bumpy, winding dirt road, I expected relief at arriving. Instead, stepping out of the car, an unforeseen anxiety crept over me. The kind of anxiety that pricks your stomach, that leaves you naked no matter how many layers you wear. At that moment, far from home, alone in the mountains and amid the pine trees, I felt watched. There was no other way to describe it.

A pang stabbed my guts and throat-clenching nausea hit. I gripped the car, trying to steady myself. Why was I hyperventilating? I had been fine driving. I tried to control my breath. Air rolled out in sharp, white puffs of steam—early spring remained cold in the Midwest.

Above me, the new moon painted the sky dark and ominous. Impenetrable mist floated like specters over the lake. What the hell. Was mundane stress just getting the better of me? Of course—that was it–nothing else. Dictating my term paper while driving had stressed me unnecessarily. Yes, I just needed to relax.

The surrounding trees doused the air with pine sap. But instead of picturing Christmas and gentle walks in the park, I fixated on the miles of wilderness that enclosed me. Behind me and before me, ancient, weathered hills rose and fell as far as the eye could see; a landscape choked thick with tall, leering pine trees. The peaceful isolation I had expected now proposed an unspoken danger.

But, of course, I wasn’t alone, was I? The property owner lived a short walk away. I saw his home from where I stood. And another cabin was a stone’s throw away. If something went wrong, if ever there was a true danger, I could knock on their door for assistance. Everything was fine.

And yet…

It was uncanny how sharply my rental contrasted to its neighbors. The others homes were post-war constructions. But the house before me, looming like a giant out of the mist, was far older—a construction from the early colonial period, if I had to place it. But why had it been built in a place so remote? Only the Algonquin and a handful of fur-traders lived here in the mid 18th century, yet the place resembled a manor house of early Quebec.

I perched upon my suitcase like a stool. My breathing slowed but remained ragged. The call of a loon rippled over the mist-shrouded lake in a low, haunting cry. Had I suffered a panic attack? No—I’d experienced them before. This was something more tangible. I ran my hand through my hair and down my neck, and as my fingers grazed the bottom of my spine, a sixth-sense loudly blared—you are in danger—flee, fly, be gone.

The hurried breath returned, and, inconspicuously as I could, I craned my neck, and I examined the ancient manor house. Then, for the first time, I saw it. In the moment, I doubted myself, certain my eyes deceived me. The night was dark, the shadows were long, and the house, of course, the house had to be empty. But I saw fingers then. Her fingers—it’s fingers. The movement was subtle. A window glared out of the eastern side of the house, and for a moment the drapes shuddered. Then, three fingers like rotted willow branches slipped past the lacy fabric, and, moving as a spider crawls, they stroked the window glass.

A figure emerged from the mist. Instantly, I toppled off the suitcase with an undignified screech.

“Hey, whoa, sorry, didn’t mean to startle you, bud.” The man showed his empty hands. “You John?”

“What? Yes, I’m John. Sorry, my nerves are always a bit shot. Didn’t mean to shout.” I rose shakily and wiped the sweat from my brow. Over the years, I’ve learned to cloak my panics fairly well; I’d rather not present myself as a skittish rabbit to the rest of the world. But subtly was difficult at present.

“No, no, that was my fault. Hard to see out here with the mist. Gets a little spooky. Shouldn’t have crept up on you like that. But I saw your car pull up and wanted to give you the keys before I went to bed. Oh, I’m Reggie. The guy you emailed.”

“Right, yes.” I wiped dirt and grass from my palm and briefly shook his hand. Reggie had a grey, curly, balding, mop of hair, and he wore an over-vibrant Hawaiian shirt. Somehow, he exuded the aura of a lifelong bachelor and a man on his third divorce. “Here, let me show you the place,“ he said, “it’s a real beaut, you’re gonna love it.” Without a word, he hauled my suitcase off the ground, waddled to the front door and clicked it open with a key.

Reggie was right, though ‘beaut’ really undersells. Gorgeous, immaculate, almost untouched by the withering gaze of time. The walls, the floors, all original. Only the decor hindered it. Greige and generic, down to the tiniest detail. Not even flea-market finds or well-loved hand-me downs, everything mass-produced from IKEA and Amazon.

Controversial to some, I believe a house has a soul. A bit woo-woo, I know, but indulge me–consider how much weight we place upon the word ‘home’.

As soon as you read those four letters, you saw an image, didn’t you? An image that’s more vivid and detailed than any other noun you throw around—I’m certain. And if we, as humans, impart such significance to a home—a place of rest, of play, an entire nexus for human relationship and connection, how can a house help but absorb some of that immaterial weight we place upon it?

I don’t pretend to know the soul of a house. But seeing the grandeur before me, this careful construction made lifetimes ago, filled with things no one loves or cares for, existing as a place no one calls home, now relegated to brief rendezvous with strangers, trapped in a sort of architectural prostitution, I have to wonder—what’s left of this house’s soul?

I trailed behind Reggie as he gave me a tour. Human company helped calm me, but I couldn’t shake that memory of movement in the window. Had it just been the drift of shadows? Of a passing cloud obscuring the stars? Irrational illusions conjured by panic? Doubtless, that was all it was and nothing more. As Reggie headed to the door, offering the customary ‘good night’ and ‘sleep well’, I asked, “Sorry, probably silly to ask but–”

“No, no, go ahead, what’s up?”

I hesitated awkwardly, then asked, “Is anyone else in the house?”

For a moment, confusion twisted on Reggie’s face. He had just walked me through the entire house—clearly, no one else was here. “No, just you. Got the whole place to yourself. All weekend. Peace and quiet,” he chuckled, “All alone.” Then, he waved his last goodnight, smiled and closed the front door.

Arching my neck, I studied the vaulting ceiling above, taking the house in in all its glory. “All alone,” I repeated.

I’m not sure what woke me that night. I sleep poorly most days, but that night my dreams were particularly unsettling. It's hard to recall details. I just remember the lake, and the pulsing uterus in place of where the house now stood. Then, a woman crawling out of the reeds and reaching towards me. I shrieked and jolted awake in a cold sweat. Breathing hard, I looked over at my phone—no signal. I checked the clock on the wall–still hours from dawn. I groaned, then I rolled out of bed to get some water. I just needed to shake the dream.

Walking to the bathroom, I saw the door. It stood out like a screaming alarm. Wood the color of a blood-filled heart, and those strange symbols carved into the frame. I don’t know how I could’ve missed it during the house tour. Now, knowing all I know, I wonder–had the door hid from me, lurking like a wolf among the pines?

I edged to the door. Music emerged—a mother humming as though to soothe her restless child. I wasn’t alone in the house. 

Instead of fear, anger overtook me. I had sacrificed invaluable time to relax, and some squatter sought to scare me off. The money could be refunded, but time wasted is gone forever. I snatched the door knob. Instantly, a brutal cold shocked me—the weathered brass stung like an ice bucket. I recoiled, stumbling. The sudden pain disrupted my anger and, finally, clarity struck—what was I doing, barging in on a woman unwell enough to squat in a stranger’s home? Abruptly, the humming stopped. Had she heard me? I held my breath, but I couldn’t stop picturing the gnarled fingers carrying a rusty knife.

Instinct flooded me—flee, fight, hide. Dumbly, I froze. I couldn’t drive, not after all the Ambien. And no one was awake at this hour—who would open their door? Could I overpower this woman if she bore a knife?

The door rattled. Then, slowly, the old brass knob turned.

Startled, I tripped. My knees struck the wooden floor. Pain. Sharp, stinging, pain erupted, but I barely took note. The knob kept turning, twisting like clock hands counting down an execution. I scrambled up to my feet, and I ran.

Legs pumping, I charged down the hallway in a mad sprint. Other steps now mingled with my own fervent dash—heavy feet, far larger than my own. They moved deliberately, walking their unworried stride, accompanied by a wet, squelching drag across the floor—a tail, a third limb, hair like river kelp or a pulsing, writhing mass of organs. Whatever stalked me wasn’t human, I had no doubt of it.

Dread strangled me. Choking, gasping, I slammed my bedroom door shut, and I turned the lock inside. I hadn’t looked behind. I couldn’t bring myself to. Not pausing to catch my breath, I grabbed furniture and stacked them into a barricade.

I waited. I watched the clock on the wall turn and tick. Three o’clock became four o’clock, and silence permeated the house. No footsteps. No haunting lullaby. No sign of a living soul but my own beating heart. Slowly, gradually, the terror of the last hour dimmed. My eyes grew heavy. The hypnotic calm of Ambien overtook the fear, and finally, I slipped into a deep slumber.

Bird song awoke me. I rubbed my eyes, and I stumbled out of bed. The barricade remained untouched. Having slept through the morning, last night now seemed far away. Had I spooked myself and over-reacted to a nightmare? That had to be it.

Yet, despite my rationalizations, I hesitated at the door. A robin’s chirp penetrated the window glass–the sound of newborn spring and gentle mornings and melted snow. The world awaited outside, a shining sun baking dew-tipped grass, a reality wholly incongruent with the heavy, soaking footsteps I had heard in the dead of night.

I couldn’t hide forever. Piece by piece, I unbarricaded the door. I armed myself with a minimalist, white desk lamp, and then I carefully opened the door. The hinges creaked. The wooden floor beneath me groaned.

Nothing—the hallway was empty. I shuffled forward and peeked past the bend—nothing still. The blood-red wood, the intricate symbols out of a nightmare had been replaced by an unadorned, white wall. The door was gone.

I trembled. The lamp slipped. Glass cracked on the floor. A panic attack welled within me, ready to pounce.

Desperate, my mind reached for the most obvious explanation—the Ambien. Its side effects were notorious. Abnormal thoughts. Memory problems. Hallucinations. Oddly, the realization comforted me. No disruptions to reality, no fractures in my own sanity threatened. The side-effects of a powerful drug had victimized me and nothing more. The panic dissipated and returned to its resting, dormant state. Relieved, I searched for a broom and dustpan to clean up the broken lamp.

Afterwards, I followed my doctor’s orders as best I could. First, yoga and calisthenics followed by a hearty breakfast, then a stroll around the lake. Truly, it was lovely. The weather warmed to the low sixties. Instead of music, I listened to the rustle of new leaves on the wind, the chirps and chitters of the natural world, and the occasional splash of a frog leaping into the water.

When I returned to the house, I felt revitalized. However, throughout my walk, a single subject dug at me—the house. How had the house come to be? Its mere existence upended everything I understood. Outliers exist, of course, but a three-century old manor nestled on a remote shore of the great lakes wasn’t mere anomaly—it was historical impossibility.  There had to be records, proof of ownership, a history behind so ornate a dwelling in such a lonely place. Unable to resist the lure of a mystery, I scoured the house.

I searched fruitlessly for hours, until I doubled back to the library. Cheap paperbacks stuffed wooden shelves built into the walls. I had written them off early—answers wouldn’t be hiding in a weathered Tom Clancy. But this time, I looked closer. The shelves were gorgeous, all original pieces. Barely any restoration marred the intricate wood frames. How was the house in such good repair after three hundred years? Impossibilities layered upon impossibilities. Scanning the library, I noticed one shelf differed from its companions—a slight indent, a different shade of wood. An old secret, perhaps.

I shoved aside the paperbacks and pressed the shelf’s back panel. The shelf clicked and groaned mechanically. Centuries old grime erupted, and the panel opened. I hacked and coughed a throat full of dust. Past watering eyes, I saw an ancient book within. Carefully, I removed the text. 

Gold lettering etched the cover, the sheen somehow undimmed by ages. Breaking the silence of the library, I whispered its title aloud—“The Book of Iben Droll”.

I leafed through the beginning. The text presented a dark account of early America, of a budding nation drenched with the occult and rife with pacts and promises to things both devils and angels fear; of competing sorcerous circles sailing west, each sect desperate to bleed the new world dry. In an account of the clashes that followed, the author wrote:

*The civil wars of the Graven Clan and the Yenafar Covens create no victors—only blood and plague and the lurking packs of nyghoul who hunt from the night sky. The passage must be opened, so she, Ves-vorden, last mother and the final rot of time, may put her bickering children to bed. Screlwroth! Migthor! Azad a thul! Be born by nail and thread, cast placenta into dirt and let the womb grow walls upon the shore.*

Hours passed. Page by page, I descended into the book. Words infiltrated my veins in the sweaty high of a drug. Fictions turned to belief until the resistance of reason seeded doubt, and the tug of war between the world I knew and a world I feared dream drove my eyes madly onward into the nightmarish text.

Sunset came and went, and when I finally tore my gaze from *The Book of Iben Droll*, I hurled it to the floor. Sweat beaded my brow. I needed water. Shaking, panting, I staggered to the kitchen. I shoved a glass under the faucet. Water jerked and spilled with every tremor. 

From the kitchen window, I observed a world irreconcilable with what I had just absorbed.  A family of four circled a bonfire—a mother, a father, two daughters. The girls had speared marshmallows on a stick. Gooey, white sugar charred and melted. They looked so blissful, so idly content, peacefully unaware of what crimes the Ulvian Magi had committed against their second born, of the tiny feet dangling between their dark beards and split grins—the indelible image of Saturn devouring his sons, climbing forth from the academies of Prague and the guilds unseen of London, to finally emerge, unbowed, into the light of a new world.    

Watching the family, I collapsed into wheezing, ugly sobs.

Hunching over the kitchen sink, I squeezed the countertop tight as a cliff’s edge. Tears tumbled into the soapy water. Bubbles popped. The water rippled at my pathetic barrage.

Heaving and gasping, I shook my head and snapped, “Stop it. Don’t be stupid. It’s just a book.” I repeated the words like a mantra, willing it to be true. “It’s just a book, John. Just a book.” Why was I reacting this way?

“Paranoid idiot,” I muttered. My nerves accelerated everything to the extreme. My doctor had suggested Zoloft in the past. Maybe I should give it a try.

Nerves. That’s all it was. The book was no more dangerous than a Stephen King novel. Probably far less so. There had, after-all, been that wave of creepy clowns years ago.

One of them stalked my neighborhood when I was kid. He had shoved a knife under my chin. Cornered me. I hadn’t learned to ride a bike as a kid, so I always walked to my friend’s house. Past the bushes, past Mrs. Nevin’s house, and then, there he was, white-faced and leering grin. “Run, run, fast as you can…or I’ll open you up, limb from limb, inside my big, dark, van.” The clown slashed his knife, and it cut across my cheek. I whimpered. He cackled and howled. Then, in a desperate moment, I tried to distract him. I pulled the zipper of his pale, leather mask and I unzipped it. Reflexively, the clown grabbed his mask before it slipped. Then, I ran. Police scoured the neighborhood, never found the guy. I still have the scar on my cheek though.

No—everything was fine. There was no knife, no menacing, leering eyes. No one else was in the house. Just a strange, unsettling book. Psychotic ramblings from the 18th century. Fascinating, but hardly dangerous. Maybe the psychology department would even find it intriguing.

The book still laid upon the floor. It sat open at the spine, the pages flayed wide. I moved to pick up the book. Hand trembling, inches away, I wavered.

Suddenly, the front door shuddered. A heavy fist pounded against it. I jumped. Then, quieter, I heard Reggie ask, “John, you there?”

“Coming!” Grateful for the distraction, I rushed to the door.

At the front, Reggie was accompanied by the man I’d seen sitting at the bonfire. Broad and muscular, he towered over Reggie and I. Tattoos covered his arms. Everything about the guy suggested military, maybe special forces.

The man barked at me, “Sir, please ask your wife to stop—” he hesitated, seeking the right word, “—ask her to stop…dancing. In the window. Upstairs. It's upsetting my kids. And my wife. And me. Look, I don’t get much leave time, and we’re just trying to relax.”

Reggie butted in, “and you didn’t mention a second guest. It’s extra if you have guests. It’s fine, but you’re supposed to let me know up front. And regardless, I mean, she can’t be upsetting other visitors. Allen here, he’s just trying to relax, just like you are.”

I tilted my head, sensing I had lost a plot thread. “But… I’m alone. What do you mean? Look—there’s no other cars in the driveway.” I pointed to my run-down Toyota. “You saw me arrive. I was alone then, wasn’t I? Do you really think someone took an Uber all the way out here? To the middle of nowhere?”

The two men stared at my solitary car in the driveway. Bewilderment struck Reggie like a truck. The big soldier beside him, Allen, apparently, shifted from anger to confusion. Cautiously, he tip-toed backwards, and he eyed the house’s eastern wall. He pointed, “then, who the hell is that?” 

A dark outline moved behind the pale drapes. A woman’s. I stared.

Dancing isn’t the word I would have chosen. Writhing perhaps. Maybe coiling, like serpentine scales, or the molding of dirt and red clay to something approximating a woman’s flesh. But dancing? No, no part of that woman was dancing. Was she in labor? Or the heavy throes of ecstasy? I saw only the outline of a shrieking face and a mass of animalistic body parts.

“Let’s take a look boys,” said Allen. He adjusted the gun holster at his side and marched into the house.

Sometimes, the male brain is a stupid thing. Wars have been waged and entire nations have fallen beneath the indomitable fear of being a wuss. And despite having two academic degrees in the bank, I was no exception. Nobody wants to be the wuss.

Without pause, Reggie and I followed. He took a poker from the fireplace. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen. I didn’t feel much braver though. I leaned over to Reggie and asked, “Has that window always been there? On the eastern wall?”

He tilted his head at me. “Of course. Why wouldn’t it be.” He paused, “I mean. I’m pretty sure. Has to be, right?”

“Right,” I agreed, not at all certain.

We approached the stairs. The woman’s humming lullaby echoed from above.

“You hear that?” I asked, desperate to confirm I wasn’t losing it.

“Sure do,” Allen whispered. “Weird as hell.” Yet, the haunting surrealness of the song gave him no pause as he headed up the stairs.

We followed, and soon, we all stood at the door, its wood blood-red and the symbols carved into it like tattoos on flesh. I recognized the symbols now; the strange shapes littered all throughout *The Book of Iben Droll*.

Reggie stuttered, “I don’t think…has this door always been here? It must have been, right? Right?”

“Some doors have a mind of their own,” Allen muttered.

“What’s that supposed to mean?” I asked.

“Travel the world enough, and you see some things,” said Allen. “Nothing we can’t handle though.” He reached and tried the knob—locked.

Reggie fished a key-ring from his pocket. “Got to be here somewhere.” One by one he tried the keys. None of them fit.

As he studied the keys, double-checking to see if he’d overlooked one, my guts squeezed painfully and my throat tightened. Weight pressed down on my tongue like vomit before it spews. I choked and gagged. My jaw unclenched and words spilled out like bile. “Screlwroth! Migthor! Azad a thul!” As I uttered the words, the image of a bestial shadow lurking through a city of stone sprung to my mind.

The lock clicked. The door glided open, and what lay beyond insulted all logic and reason. The room was a history within a house—at least, that’s the most graspable description. They were…memories—I think? At least, I hope they were just memories. Otherwise—to be trapped, to be doomed to repeat the horror of your own terrible end—it was a fate no better than Dante’s hell.  

Dim, red light flooded the great chamber beyond. Memories floated within like living tapestries, life-size works somehow woven into three dimensions. I recognized the tapestries, intricate scenes playing out from the book’s final chapters.

A dozen leaders from America's secretive covens and violent wizard clans arrived at this house, lured under the guise of peace and diplomatic meetings. The architect of the house, a great sorcerer herself, had declared the wars too costly; she offered a final end to the strife.

More images drifted past. Woven tapestries blinking in and out of reality. Thirteen souls around a table, ready for a feast. Bearded men bent over in dark robes. Stately gentry in powdered wigs and fine suits. Women adorned in petticoats and exquisite gowns. Witches wearing little more than what the forest provided. A scene of the last supper born of heresy and deceit.

The humming lullaby persisted, growing louder, washing through me like a paralytic drug. Dread screamed inside my mind, but my muscles stayed frozen.

A distant, dark figure. Movement. It prowled, lurking through red light and the blinking memories, hiding behind the horrible deaths—the punctured bodies and the peeled faces and the wretched shrieks. Closer now—the glimpses more vivid—the figure of a woman, not of flesh and bone, but made of black tatters and muddy, wet clay. The woman slid closer, still a hundred feet away, the sedating song playing off her sideways lips in a thudding, steady drone.

I blinked, and then, there she was–now no distance between us. She examined me, her face, pale and mask-like. Her tattered neck stretched and circled around me, never touching me but twisting and spiraling about like the cord of an old phone.

She paused, floating. Dark rags and pale mud hung in the air. Beneath the bleach-white mask, her eyes were distinctly human—a deep and watery blue. Yet, when I gazed into them, I understood nothing, and that was the most frightening thing of all. And as she stared back, her face inches from mine, I wondered—could she see all of me? Naked and ugly, the things I hate, the things I love, all that I had hidden and stored away—did she see them now with that soulless gaze?

And, at last, that fear broke whatever spell had captured me. My muscles twitched. My hand lifted, and slowly, I reached for her face.

It was a mad thing to do—I know. But the injuries of the past train us. They turn mad, irrational ideas into the only possible safe passage. The wounds play on repeat, play without end, priming us to face that same dark moment again and again—regardless the damage done to your life, all on the off-chance you meet another clown with a knife.

I saw what looked like a zipper, protruding from the woman’s face. Now, in retrospect, I think it was a tooth. But after countless nightmares for years on end, all I saw in that moment was the zipper of a mask.

So, I reached out, and I unzipped her face.

The lullaby stopped like the scratch of a record; a piercing howl replaced it. Rags spiraled off the bleach-white mask. No hint of bone or blood showed, only wrinkled tissue like a malformed brain.

The howl woke Reggie and Allen from their stupor.

Reggie panicked. He shrieked, stabbing wildly with the fire poker. It sank into the scarred, pulsing brain. The woman of rags and clay swung about. Her long, tattered limbs shot into Reggie’s flesh like the fangs of a viper.

A hand grabbed my arm, and before I realized it, Allen was dragging me. I quickly found my feet, and I started running. I looked back once. The tattered woman had lifted Reggie like a child into the air. His punctured body slid down her arms, towards her, as though she welcomed him with a loving embrace.

Then, the dim, red light disappeared, and the door slammed shut. The lock clicked instantly.

“What,” I heaved “was that?” I bent over, exhausted by the mad sprint to be free.

“It was…older than I expected,” said Allen, not nearly as winded. “Grab your stuff. Get out. I’ll make some calls.”

“But—what about?” The awful picture of Reggie lingered in my mind.

“Can you bring back the dead?”

“What? No, of course not.”

“Too bad. Neither can I. Means there’s not much we can do for him.”

“But—”

“Grab your stuff and go.” Allen repeated.

Guilt-wracked but overwhelmed by fear, I glanced once at the red door, then I sprinted to grab my few belongings. Passing the library, I paused. *The Book of Iben Droll* still lay on the floor. Something called me to it. Terrible as it was, to risk losing this forgotten history of the continent seemed unconscionable. I hesitated. Then, I grabbed the book and stuffed it into my bag.

Driving away, I looked over my shoulder. Allen stood on the porch. He talked hurriedly on the phone. Interesting that he had cell reception out here.

I’m not sure how long I drove. Far enough to reach the nearest gas station, apparently. In the parking lot, I drank a Snapple and gathered myself. As I readied to depart, I heard the pacifying lullaby play. Had it been on the radio? Or was it just in my mind? I don’t remember anymore.

It really is a wonderful sound though. Day after day, I see the world through this exhausting, paranoid lens, but when I hear that hum, it all slips away.

Then, sitting at the gas station, as though powered by a force beyond my own want and will, I turned around, and I drove back to the house.

That’s when I saw the fire, and the professionals I highly doubt were firemen. I wonder—did the fire save my life? Or did it erase a puzzle piece—evidence to a history now nearly lost?

I still have the book. That’s why I’m posting here. I’m unsure what to do next. I could donate the book to a museum for study. However, I fear it will be dismissed as fantasy, not seen as the secret history it is. And though I worry about that history being lost, I fear the history becoming known. I keep waking in cold sweats. My neighbors tell me they hear screams at night.

I’ve also considered investigating further. Centuries ago, twelve deaths occurred on the Night of the Red Dinner. A power vacuum followed. The arcane colleges and secret covens of America were left in disarray—and through this chaos, the book’s author built a hidden empire from the night’s ashes. And then, through ritual and dark pact, she grew other structures from the dirt, other powerful, eldritch places. I could seek out those long, forgotten, strongholds of power.

The idea thrills me and, so too, it terrifies me. But to delve into such dark dens, to seek a history the world forgot, what other scholastic pursuit could compare? I’m also unsure what else to do now. I’ve tried to burn the book. Multiple times. But with every attempt, the lullaby plays, and the match gradually slips from my fingers.
