The human body is gross. That’s the thought running through my head when standing in front of my bathroom mirror. I swallow thickly, feeling that small lump, that slight but ever annoying presence in the back of my throat. I open my mouth, sticking out my tongue. I use my phone’s flashlight to see into the back of my mouth. Yep, there it is. I knew it. A small white blob, mostly buried, glistens wetly on my tonsil. A fucking tonsil stone. 

To those who are unfamiliar with them, they are disgusting. They basically form when bits of food get stuck in the little divots on a tonsil. Then, get bigger, combining with some types of bacteria in your mouth and hardening. As you can imagine, these things absolutely reek. They reek of rotten food and bad breath. Plus, sometimes I can feel them in my throat. Sometimes, they can dislodge themselves through gargling or clearing the throat, but I never had much luck with that. Once, back when covid was in effect, I sneezed hard into my mask and one came flying out, landing on the inside of my mask. Disgusting. 

Aside from having my tonsils removed, there’s no real way to prevent them. Unfortunately, my insurance wouldn’t cover something like that. I’ve checked. Unless there’s a problem like an infection, those useless organs are staying put. And I can’t afford that kind of thing just because it bugs me occasionally. So now I’m stuck with these gross things. 

I open my mouth, looking inside again. There it was, a small bundle of white rot nestled in the flesh of my tonsils about the size of a popcorn kernel. Unlike other tonsil stones I’ve had, this one looked perfectly spherical. Usually, the damned things were misshapen lumps reminiscent of the shape of a piece of a walnut. Odd. 

I get out a pair of tweezers. Typically, I used the pair for building miniatures so they’re long enough to reach the back of my throat without me putting my whole hand in my mouth. I steady my hands, both the one holding my phone as a flashlight and the one holding the tweezers. I have to press my tongue back in my throat to get my tonsils in the right place to clearly see the stone. This means I can neither breathe through my nose or my mouth with the position.  I can see it, the stone. Bigger than any I’ve ever had. Round, pale, almost glossy. Nestled in a pocket of flesh, like a pearl embedded in raw meat.

Something you would probably figure is that poking around in the back of your throat, no matter how lightly, can violently trigger the gag reflex. The metal of the tweezers is cold. I angle them toward the back of my throat, trying not to gag. The moment the tips touch the stone, I retch, a full-body spasm that makes me stumble back from the mirror. I breathe through my nose, steadying myself. I place my hands on the edges of the sink, grounding myself. Again. 

I open wide, reach in. The tweezers scrape my tonsil lightly and I grab the stone. I feel the pressure, the resistance. It’s stuck deep. I clamp down and pull gently. I retch, dropping the tweezers into the sink, coughing violently. My eyes water. I taste bile. I rinse the tweezers and grip them tighter. This time, I go in fast. I manage to grab it and pull hard. It doesn’t come out. Another failed attempt. Tears make my vision blurry. I gag again, harder than before. My throat convulses. I feel something dislodge. I spit into the sink, blood, mucus, and something solid. The tonsil stone. It makes a small “clink” noise as it lands in the basin.

I pick it up with the tweezers and examine it closely. It’s smooth. Round. Almost perfectly round. It glistens under the light. Usually, tonsil stones are soft, but keep their form unless pressure is applied like a ball of plaque. I grab a cotton swab and press against the flesh. It resists. It’s solid. For a brief moment, I thought it moved. Just a little bit. No, no. That couldn’t have happened. I’m just grossed out. Disgusted, I quickly toss it into the bathroom trashcan, happy to be rid of it. The way it makes the garbage bag crinkle, the way it lands in the trashcan, it sounds… substantive. Heavy. I shake my head. 

After brushing my teeth and gargling perhaps much more mouthwash than typically recommended for a while, I rinse out my sink and put the tweezers away, thinking that was the last of it. A very gross, very human experience. Maybe my dental hygiene was lacking in some way, or maybe that one had just been there for a while.  

That is, until I woke up a few days later with the same unwelcome presence in my throat. It felt swollen, uncomfortable, but not necessarily painful. I begrudgingly get out of bed and head to the bathroom. I take my morning piss, dreading looking into the mirror. Opening my mouth and looking inside, I’m horrified to find not one, but two of the damned things, now nestled in my other tonsil. 

Nope, that was more than enough. I make an appointment with my PCP and manage to get seen that day. I didn’t know what I expected, maybe confirmation that something was wrong. Maybe a biopsy. Maybe a referral to someone who dealt with weird stuff like this. 

The exam room smells like antiseptic and boredom. After a half hour of flipping through magazines that are about three months out of date, I’m finally called back. The doctor, a middle-aged guy with tired eyes and a clipboard, listens patiently as I describe the stone. I even showed him a photo I’d taken before trashing it. He squints at the photo, then shrugs.

“Looks like a tonsil stone,” he says. “They can vary in size and texture. Sometimes they calcify more than usual. It’s normal.”

“Normal?” I asked. “The thing was pretty big and solid.” I keep any mention of it moving to myself. 

He chuckled. “Things like this happen. It’s annoying, but manageable. They can feel strange, especially if they’re pressing on nerves or inflamed tissue. If it gets infected, redness, swelling, fever, come back in. Otherwise, just keep up with oral hygiene. Gargle salt water. Maybe look into a water flosser.”

I left with a printout about tonsil stones and a sample-sized bottle of antiseptic mouthwash and not really feeling any better than when I had entered. The two I had in my throat were harder to get out, but I eventually handled it. I didn’t even look at them as I tossed them in the trashcan and then immediately took the bag to the can on the curb. 

I follow the doctor’s advice: salt water gargles, antiseptic mouthwash, flossing everyday. I even buy a water flosser, the kind that looks like a torture device for gums. My throat stays sore, but nothing new appears. No stones. No movement. 

Still, I keep checking. Every morning. Every night. I shine my phone light into my mouth, angling it just right to see the folds of my tonsils. I even start keeping a mirror in my car, just in case I felt something during the day.

I tell myself it was just anxiety. That I’m being paranoid. But then the dreams start. They aren’t nightmares, exactly. Just... wrong. I’d be standing in front of a mirror, mouth open, unable to speak. My throat would bulge, pulsing like something was trying to push through. Like I had a large, undulating goiter. I’d open my mouth to scream, only for hundreds of the stinking stones to slide out of my mouth and clack like marbles on the tile floor. I’d wake up gagging, drenched in sweat.

I stop eating solid food for a while. Soup. Yogurt. Protein shakes. Anything to avoid triggering that feeling, that pressure. I even stop talking as much. My voice feels strange. Thicker. Like it echoes inside me. I didn’t tell anyone. What would I say? It was obvious the doctor wasn’t worried at least. Unless I developed some kind of infection, that is. 

So I waited. One morning, I felt it again. The lump. But this time, it wasn’t just pressure. It was a movement. Slow and rhythmic. Almost difficult to perceive if I wasn’t holding still. I’m going crazy. That must be the answer. I’m going crazy and I’m having hallucinations. 

What does someone do when they think they have no answers? Turn to the internet. I Google many things I now wish I hadn't. I thought perhaps I was dealing with some rare, specific version of a teratoma, those tumors that can grow teeth and hair and all kinds of crazy shit. The pictures of the tumors are something I will never be able to scrub my brain from. But apparently, those tend to grow in reproductive organs or the tailbone. I couldn’t find anything that sounded like what I was experiencing. I remember the doctor saying something about calcification. What was it he said? 

I decide to open up my medical notes through my patient portal. The interface is clunky, clearly built on some outdated CMS. I click through my visit history, then into the backend of the appointment summary. There’s a lot of medical jargon, a non-commital reference to a slightly elevated blood pressure, and the basic notes from my visit. Nothing enlightening. 

I pause when I see a little pencil icon at the bottom left of the note’s box. I recognize it’s a commonly used edit icon. Not just for my contact info or insurance, but for the actual visit notes. I click it and a text cursor appears at the end of the last sentence in the visit note. For some reason, I had write permissions. That wasn’t good. The system shouldn’t allow that. As someone who works in web design, I know how these portals are built. Patients should never have write access to clinical records. That’s a liability nightmare and a hacker’s wet dream. 

I’m about to give the clinic a call when I notice something else. A new button I didn’t see before. “Click to expand hidden notes.” I click it and read the one message entry that’s there from the day of my visit. Then I read it again. 

“Subject shows early signs of viable formation. Monitor progression. Do not intervene unless threshold is exceeded.”
