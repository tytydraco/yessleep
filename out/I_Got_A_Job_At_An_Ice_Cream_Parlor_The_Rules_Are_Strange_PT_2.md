My aunt picked me up right outside the store. Thankfully, she was an early riser, so she was more than happy to give me rides. I opened the door and sat down. I said nothing at first, but soon my aunt was asking me about the job.

“Hey, kiddo, how was your first night?” she asked.

“It was fine,” I lied.

I didn’t want to tell her about any of it. People would think I was insane if I told them what had happened to me.

“Just fine?” she asked.

“It went by pretty fast, and it wasn’t too busy, so I just stood around most of the time,” I said.

“Well, that’s good. I’m glad your first night wasn’t that bad,” she said.

My mind was in a state of chaos. Ghosts or whatever those things were. They were real. Something lived in the freezer. And my boss was probably a demon. A sane person would’ve left after the first hour, but for some reason curiosity (and money) kept me there. The thought of not going back made me feel better, but I knew that wasn’t an option. My mind was made up it was my mission to figure out what was going on in that place.

“Sammy, are you okay?” Aunt Nelly asked.

“Yeah, sorry. I’m just tired. I need to eat and go to bed,” I said.

“Have you ever seen a ghost, Aunt Nelly?” I asked.

She looked at me, confused.

“No, I can’t say that I have,” she said.

“Oh, okay. Just wondering,” I said.

I got home, ate something, and went to bed. I woke up and got ready for work.

“Hey, Sam, you can take the car to work tonight!” she yelled from downstairs.

“Okay, thanks, Aunt Nelly!” I yelled back.

I got to work about an hour early. I wanted to scope out the place before I started my next shift. The anxiety and fear were gone at this point. The rules seemed simple enough, so I wasn’t that worried. I messed up once last night, and I was going to make sure it didn’t happen again. With the night planned in my head, I stepped into the store right before my shift began.

“Hey Samuel, how are you doing today?” Tina said from behind the counter.

“Pretty good, just getting ready for my shift,” I said.

“How was your first night?” she asked. “How did it go?”

“It was great. I just hope it looked good for you today,” I lied.

“Oh yes, Betty said you left the store spotless last night,” she said.

“I try,” I laughed.

I walked into the back of the store and put my keys on the boss’s desk. I walked back to the front a minute before my shift, and Tina was gone. I clocked in and went straight to the freezer to knock. I turned around and grabbed the egg timer on the prep counter, setting it for 58 minutes to make sure I didn’t miss anything tonight. The phone began to ring, and I made my way to the back.

“Hello, Andes Ice Cream. How can I help you?” I asked.

“Hello, Samuel. How was your night?” Mr. Andes said.

My anxiety spiked immediately I could feel my heart beating through my chest.

“Hey, Mr. Andes, it was great,” I lied again.

“Only one mishap the entire night. I’m impressed, boy,” he said gleefully.

The thought of whatever was in that freezer made my skin crawl. I had so many questions for Mr. Andes, but I wasn’t sure he’d give me the answers I wanted. I cleared my head and asked anyway.

“Mr. Andes, what’s going on in this shop?” I asked hesitantly.

He looked at me with a sinister grin, smiling ear to ear.

“Are you asking me if you’re safe, Sammy?” he replied.

“I guess I just need some reassurance, to be honest,” I said.

“Sammy, follow the rules to a T and nothing will happen to you. That’s my word,” he said.

He grabbed his coat and started for the back door. His hand froze on the doorknob, and he stood there motionless for a few seconds, statue-like. Then he let go, turned back, and looked at me.

“Sammy, I forgot to mention there is one new rule tonight. But don’t worry, okay?” he said.

My blood ran cold. As simple as the rules were, I knew that one more meant another thing to remember… another chance to end up in harm’s way. He swung the back door open and disappeared into the alley.

Mr. Andes didn’t seem like a bad guy, but at this point I wasn’t sure what to think of him. Was he some sort of demon sent to guard the creature in the freezer, or just a creepy dude who enjoyed frozen treats and making people happy? I walked back to his desk and noticed the rule sheet was there again. All the same rules except one.

**Rule 6: Do not check the bathrooms. If a customer enters and does not come back out, lock the door and leave it alone. It is no longer your concern.**

I stood there staring at the rule with a sinking feeling in my gut. The rules before this seemed simple in comparison. What was happening to the people I locked in the bathroom? I decided to brush it off for now and move on with the night.

I worked a couple of hours serving people that came and went, knocking on the freezer when needed. The bell over the door jingled as a man wandered in, looking tired and pale. I offered him the usual smile the one that never quite reached my eyes.

The man didn’t order. He didn’t even glance at the tubs of ice cream behind the glass. He just muttered something about needing the restroom and shuffled toward the back.

For a while, it was quiet. The store’s hum felt heavier than usual, the fluorescent lights buzzing like nervous teeth. I wiped down the counter just to keep my hands busy, my ears tuned to every creak and shuffle in the back.

Then it started.

A sound low at first like someone groaning through clenched teeth. Then a gasp. Then the unmistakable sound of a scream, jagged and raw, tearing through the thin bathroom door.

My heart hammered. I looked at the clock. It had been maybe five minutes. My body wanted to sprint, to push the door open, to help. Every part of me screamed that this was wrong. I wasn’t supposed to just listen.

But I knew the rules.

My hand shook as I stepped toward the back. The screams twisted now, bending into something less human like the man’s throat was being pulled apart just to make room for a new sound. My teeth clenched. I pressed my palm to the door, the vibrations of the man’s agony rattling against my skin.

And then, against everything in me, I locked the bolt.

The lock clicked loud in the hallway.

The screaming stopped.

I stood there, my chest rising and falling in ragged bursts. My stomach churned with guilt, bile, and a sickening understanding: whatever was in that bathroom now wasn’t the man anymore.

I knocked on the door, nothing.

Against my better judgment, I unlocked it and slowly pulled it open.

The bathroom was spotless. In fact, it even had a lemony scent wafting out.

I slammed the door shut and stumbled backward onto the floor.

“What the hell is this place!” I yelled.

I stood up, turned, and walked back to the front, wiping my hands on my apron as if I could rub off the feeling that would never go away. I looked up at the clock again. It had been about eight minutes since the bell above the door rang and now again there nothing.

The shop stood silent, besides the buzz from the lights. Almost like nothing had happened at all.

An eerie peace settled over me. Whatever was in that bathroom was satiated for now.

I stood at the front waiting for another customer, but things had slowed down. The egg timer in the back went off, so I made my way to the freezer, knocked, and returned to the counter.

It was now 9 p.m. From this point forward, I expected things to stay quiet.

I wandered around and poked through some of the papers on Mr. Andes’s desk. Nothing looked out of the ordinary except for the book I’d read from the night before when I missed my hourly knock. The thing looked ancient, bound in black leather, the cover bare of symbols or writing.

I reached out to open it, curiosity buzzing in my chest but before I could flip it open, the bell above the door chimed.

It was the boy and his father. Same expression. Same clothes. Same everything.

“Hey, guys, welcome to Mr. Andes,” I said, half-smiling.

“I’d like to get a couple of vanilla ice cream cones for my son and me,” the man said in a soft, low voice.

“No problem, sir. Let me grab your cones and we’ll get those started,” I said, not losing eye contact with him as I backed up toward the freezer.

I grabbed the cones, brought them back to the counter, and scooped out the vanilla. The man and boy both stood there looking sad as ever.

“Would you like toppings?” I asked.

They shook their heads in unison. I handed them their cones.

“Son, I seem to have left my wallet at home. Is there any way you could...”

I cut him off. “Sir, let me take care of that for you.”

I was fully expecting him to lose it if I didn’t. For the first time since I’d seen them, they smiled And then right before my eyes they evaporated into nothing. A wave of happiness washed over me, warm and almost protective, like a blanket. I wasn’t even surprised at this point, watching people vanish into thin air. I had made that boy and his father happy, and somehow that was enough. It was my little way of balancing out the horror of the man who had disappeared into the bathroom just minutes earlier.

“If I make it through this night, I’m gonna need a shrink,” I chuckled to myself, trying to clear my head.

Then the TV in the dining room switched on by itself.

A news anchor appeared on the screen, speaking solemnly about the anniversary of the tragic accident that claimed the lives of Steven and his young son, Jason Monarch a father and child who had died in a car crash just outside the ice cream parlor. Tears welled in my eyes. The TV shut off on its own. I understood. It wanted me to know.

Every kid worries about their first nine-to-five being hard work. I’m just worried mine is going to kill me.

The next couple of hours flew by. The knocks continued, and other than the boy and his dad, no other customers came in. I started to wonder why they even needed a night shift worker if no one showed up. I pushed the thought aside and went about my routine. It was 11:25 now, so I began to top off the strawberry ice cream for Kathy. Tonight, I’d be ready for her. Midnight came and like clockwork, Kathy shuffled past the front windows and into the store.

**“Oh, it’s you again, boy? So you decided to stay?”**

“Hello, Kathy. Is it gonna be strawberry tonight?” I asked, trying to sound polite, trying to appease her.

**“Of course, you nitwit! Why would you even ask!!?”**

Her voice ripped through the air like claws on glass. I jumped back, nearly out of my skin, and began making her cone, my hands shaking uncontrollably.

**“Boy, why are you so afraid? I’m just a little old lady.”**

She started laughing.

It was a laugh that grew louder and louder, filling every corner of the shop. The sound made me nauseous. I felt like I might pass out. Then, just as the cone touched her hand, the laughter stopped. She looked down at the ice cream.

**“Well, thank you, boy. This cone looks almost perfect.”**

Her eyes softened, just for a moment.

**“Maybe you aren’t so bad. Maybe.”**

She turned and walked out the door, vanishing into the night.

I let out a massive sigh, my body trembling with relief. I made my way to the back. A sane person would’ve left right then. But I couldn’t. I didn’t know why I just couldn’t walk away. The phone rang.

I picked it up and forced cheer into my voice. “Thanks for calling Mr. Andes Ice Cream Parlor. How can I help you?”

**“How are you doing, Sammy boy?”**

The moment I heard Mr. Andes’s voice, that little voice in my head the one that had been screaming at me all night exploded.

“Mr. Andes, what the hell is going on here?” I snapped. “You’ve told me nothing about this place or the damn rules I’ve been following.”

**“I understand your frustration, boy. But there are more important things at stake than you can imagine.”**

I sat there in silence, rage boiling in my chest. His vagueness only made it worse.

Before I could speak, he continued.

**“The shop is more than just a shop,”**

**“Some might even say… it’s living.”**

“What do you mean, living?” I asked.

**“Dont worry Sammy boy,”**

He abruptly hung up. I stared at the receiver, my blood running cold.

"The shop is alive?" I said out loud. "What the hell was I a part of?"

I tried not to think about it, but the words dug into me anyway. Only a couple hours left. Just a couple hours, and I’d be free. By 3 a.m., the shop was quiet. Too quiet. No sign of the man in black. Only a couple hours left, I thought. Just hold on. I started getting the store ready for the next shift. That’s when I felt it. The bell above the door never rang. The air shifted heavier, colder like a storm cloud had seeped through the walls. My skin prickled before I even realized he was there.

Black shoes hovered inches above the tile, gliding forward without a sound. A long coat trailed behind him like smoke, and though I kept my eyes glued to the floor, I could feel it an endless, impossible blackness staring back at me. The man in black stopped at the counter. The hum of the freezers went silent, leaving the store in a suffocating stillness. My throat went dry. I tightened my grip on the edge of the counter, staring at the scuffed linoleum beneath my feet. His voice came low, rattling, as if layered with echoes of a thousand others.

**“How many have gone into the bathroom and not returned?”**

I swallowed hard. My voice shook.

“O-one, sir.” I cracked.

The man in black leaned closer. The air hissed like a leaking pipe.

**“And did you lock the door?”**

“Yes, sir.”

Silence. Long, crushing. The weight of it pressed against my skull until I thought it might split open.

**“Do you think that makes you innocent?”**

My stomach flipped. I wanted to scream, to look up, to tell him I had no choice. But the rules thundered in my head, louder than my own heartbeat.

My eyes stayed locked on the floor.

“No, sir.”

The man exhaled, a sound like wind moaning through a graveyard. Then came more questions. About the customer. About the one who never walked out. About him. Each one more unbearable than the last, until I felt smaller than a child, my voice barely a whisper in the dead store. Finally, the air shifted again. The weight lifted. The hum of the freezers returned. I dared to breathe. No footsteps. No door. Nothing. He was just… gone.

My knuckles ached where I’d clutched the counter. Slowly, I looked up, eyes stinging. The store looked exactly the same as before. But it wasn’t. It never was after he came. The rest of the night dragged calm but only in the way a graveyard feels calm. My nerves were shot. I needed a shower, a bed, anything but this place. And then, salvation. The door opened at 5 a.m. and Betty walked in.

“Hey, Samuel!” she called.

“Hey, Betty, it’s so nice to see you!” I almost shouted back.

“How was your night, hun?” she asked.

I sighed. The weight of the night slid off my shoulders like a crumbling wall.

“Betty, it was fine… but I think I may have bitten off more than I can chew,” I admitted.

“Aww, that’s unfortunate, hun. The last manager left too without saying a word. Walked out right in the middle of his shift. No one’s heard from him since.”

The poor guy. He hadn’t followed the rules. I didn’t want to imagine what happened to him.

Before I could respond, a car horn honked outside. Betty and I turned toward the window. A pair of older women were waving wildly from a car. We waved back.

“I wish I had that much energy in the morning,” Betty laughed.

I forced a smile, said my goodbyes, and walked out.

Good riddance to that cursed ice cream parlor. I got in my car and made my way home. I pulled up in front of the house, my car rattling the whole way until it finally shut off with a groan. For once, it felt good just to be home. My aunt was on the porch watering her plants, humming something low under her breath. For a fleeting moment, things felt almost normal again.

Then I saw the sedan.

A black four-door eased up to the curb, moving too smoothly, too deliberately. It didn’t belong here, and I knew it before the doors even opened. Two men stepped out in perfect unison, both dressed in sharp black suits with bright red ties. Their polished shoes caught the streetlight, their faces unreadable. My aunt froze, the garden hose dripping from her hand. She didn’t speak, but I could feel the tension radiating off her as the taller man looked straight at her and spoke in a voice that felt like it had already chosen the outcome.

**“Ma’am, would you mind giving us a moment with your nephew?”**

She gave me one last look, a mix of warning and fear, before slipping inside. The door creaked shut, leaving me alone with them. Both men turned their attention toward me at once, their gazes heavy and unblinking.

**“Samuel, I presume,”**

The taller man said and my stomach dropped. They already knew my name.

**“We have a few questions about your place of employment,” the shorter one added.**

I shoved my hands into my jacket pockets, hoping to hide the tremor in them.

“What kind of questions?” I asked, my voice thinner than I wanted it to be.

The shorter man tilted his head, his sharp eyes gleaming unnaturally.

**“Do you always keep the strawberry flavor stocked at midnight?”**

The words hit me like a punch. My throat went dry. The taller man scribbled something into a notepad while I struggled to respond.

“Yes… always,” I cracked.

He leaned closer, his voice dropping to a whisper that slithered into my bones.

**“And have you ever looked at him? The one in black?”**

A chill crawled up my spine. I forced my eyes down to the pavement.

“No. Never. I follow the rules.” I said proudly.

The taller man’s pen paused mid-scratch. The shorter one’s voice cut in, quieter, sharper.

**“Would you go back...if we needed you to?”**

The words echoed in my skull. My mind felt like jelly.

“Who are you guys?” I asked, barely managing to speak.

They exchanged a glance, unreadable. Then, without answering, one of them slipped a hand into his jacket and pulled out a plain white card. He pressed it into my hand with deliberate care. In the center was a strange black emblem: a circle with three arrows pointing inward, all surrounded by a ring with three outlined marks at the ends. I had seen it before, though I couldn’t say where. It didn’t feel like a logo. It felt like a warning.

Beneath the emblem were three words: **Secure. Contain. Protect.**

**“Call this number, if things… change.”**

I flipped the card over. A single phone number was scrawled neatly across the back. When I looked up, they were already sliding back into the sedan. The doors shut in perfect unison, the engine rumbled once, and then they were gone no headlights, no taillights, nothing.

I stood on the curb, the card burning hot in my hand. Behind the screen door, my aunt’s shadow lingered, watching me. How did they know about the rules? How did they know about him? Whatever I was involved in, it was a lot bigger than I could have ever imagined.[PT 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n1puf1/i_got_a_job_at_an_ice_cream_parlor_the_rules_are/)
