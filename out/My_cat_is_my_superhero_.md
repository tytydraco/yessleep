My cat just saved my life! 

You don't know me, of course, but I have something I need to get out to the world. 

Forgive me for coming off confusing, so... I guess I'll try to start from the beginning. I was climbing into bed last night, normal as ever. I had a great routine going - I would get up early, eat a healthy breakfast, get ready, do some exercises before work while listening to Bluey music (don't judge) go to work, get home, eat dinner, yada yada, so on. Then when I was ready for bed, I would pull out a good book and fall asleep with Alexa playing some jazzy tunes. 

Well, tonight, I had this strong urge to look outside. I regret ever doing so. I peeked my head out the curtain of my apartment building, and there was a man in the street. I would have shrugged it off, as he was right below me and seemed to be looking out into the street, maybe looking for someone to pick him up. 

Suddenly, my cat hissed and scratched me. It was weird, Bug was always so kind and cuddly. Heck, if I held him upside down by his tail he'd probably be a chill dude as ever. 

"Bug, what was that for?" I asked him, turning to the bathroom to clean my wound. 

Bug stood in the way of me and the window. He meowed, which sounded disturbingly close to a high-pitched "no." 

I tried to shoo him out of the way, but he stood his ground, hair standing on end, looking from me to the window and back while spitting ferociously. 

"Bug, chill it!" I told him. 

"No." 

"Bugzy! Let mama through!"

"No." 

I sighed and decided to lay down. And perhaps the most interesting, crazy, kind of scary happened. 

My cat spoke to me. 

"D-on't. Look. Out-side."

My jaw dropped. "Bugzy? Why don't you just say it when you need your litter box cleaned instead of yowling your head off?" 

He seemed to roll his eyes. He spoke some more. 

"Mama, I only have this power for an hour, maybe two if we're lucky. But please, don't look outside!" 

"Why can't I?" 

"The thing outside. If it sees you, it will come." 

I shuddered when he called the thing an "it." 

"So... it's not human?" 

"Not even close. It will go away in the morning, but take someone with it and never return. The unlucky person will be its servant forever, but I would rather lose half my lives than that. That'd leave me with three lives left." 

"You've already lost three lives?" 

"Uhh... back to the thing." 

"Er, whatever. What can we do then so that it doesn't see us?" 

"Keep the lights off. Stay quiet. And don't look outside. I can, because cats are like phantoms to it. It can't see us, but it's also terrified of us. I will fight to the end for you, my hooman, but you must give me a tuna breakfast tommorow morning." 

Despite myself, I smiled. "Deal." 

"Oy, whatcha doing scetchy dude? *chuckle*" 

Uh-oh. Brandon. Brandon was just upstairs from me, and he was a ride-or-die kind of guy. He drives people insane. 

SREECH!

"Hey... what are you doing... no! AHH! Put me down! Nooo-" 

Silence.

Bug cuddled close to me, nuzzling into my chest. 

"Poor guy needed a cat." 

Suddenly, there was pounding on the door. Bug sniffed in that direction. 

"Don't worry, mama. It's the camera dude." 

I reluctantly looked through the peephole. Bug was right. 

I unlocked the door and let him in. He was panting hard, sweating, and had a terrified look in his eyes. 

The camera dude also happened to be my brother. 

"Mike, are you okay?" I asked, embracing him.

"Ye- yeah, sis. But Brandon's not." 

"He got taken," said Bug, nodding. 

"Did Bug just talk?!?!" Mike asked, raising an eyebrow at his favorite nephew. 

"Yeah, he only has the superpower for a couple of hours," I explained. 

Mike seemed to calm down, a childlike spark of interest caught in his eyes. 

"Oh, that's cool," he said, chilling out. 

"Thanks," said Bug, taking his complement seriously. 

"But let's get down to business," he said." I need to show you something." 

Mike opened his phone, opening an app that had recorded the thing outside. 

First, it showed my curtains rustling, but they abruptly went back in place. The thing seemed to flinch, but froze in place again. 

A few moments later, Brandon's voice could be heard. 

"Oy! Whatcha doing scetchy dude? Hehe." 

The thing slowly turned its head. What terrified me was that its body didn't move. Instead, the head turned all the way around and looked up. It had orange eyes that seemed to glow, and its smile was full of large, pointy yellow teeth, with a few missing. It stretched wide to the edge of its face and let out a blunt rattling noise before proceeding to effortlessly climb up the side of the building. 

The scene then cut after a few moments of Brandon's screaming. 

"I. Am. TERRIFIED!" Mike cried, curling himself into a ball on the floor. 

Bug frowned and empathetically nuzzled my little brother, calming him with purrs and gentle words. 

"Look, Mike, we'll call the police and have them look around." 

And after Bug agreeing and a big embrace, that's exactly what we did. 

The police arrived shortly. Mike showed them the video. A few seemed a little uneasy, where as others were harder to read. 

They searched Brandon's apartment. There was no blood, thank the heavens, but they did see signs of struggle. Broken glass, a toppled chair, etc. 

Because the apartment building was new, only a few people lived in it. The people including me and everyone's pets were allowed at the police station overnight. 

The very next morning, Brandon was put down as a missing person and any sightings of him would be greatly appreciated. But be at ease, friends, as Bug told me this just before his powers wore off:

"The thing will not return to this dimension ever again. Brandon was the only being chosen to go with it, and the thing now has no interest in anything else. It will never come back here. Pets are forever protecting their owners because their owners protect them. We have nothing to fear, now, and Bug shall forever be protecting the universe! When you see a cat on the street, be nice to it; it may be me checking in on you! Also, dont hesitate to give me a nice tuna can. I would greatly enjoy that."

Bug looked up at me. "So now other people have my message?" He asked. 

"Yep! It's going on Reddit, and why not NoSleep, it's fitting for the category!" 

"Ooh, fun. I am Super Bug!" 

I love Bug. And yes, he got extra tuna this morning! Plus a lot of treats!
