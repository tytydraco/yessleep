I barely got a wink of sleep that night, sitting on the floor like a dog waiting for its owner, I was aware of how crazy I seemed. My gaze never wavered from the thin strip of light under the hardwood door, fixated on every subtle shift of shadow that passed through the faint glow. The steps moved almost deliberately mundane—undoubtedly walking by, feigning domesticity as whatever was outside walked around the hall as if they had owned the place.

I thought I was going insane, whatever lurked and waited for me behind that door, knew I was watching it, just as much as it was watching me.

When my eyes landed on the crucifix above the door, a subtle sense of comfort washed over me. In the dim light, it looked eerie, it almost felt cliché—as if pulled straight from a horror flick. Yet, despite its unsettling appearance, I felt, at the very least, that I was being watched over, maybe a product of my upbringing, being made to believe inanimate statues and objects held something more than just the stones and concrete it was made from.

See, I wasn't overtly religious—faith had never been something I leaned on heavily—but it was woven into my upbringing. Growing up, my family always made sure religious iconographies surrounded us and our home as reminders of the protection and faith they believed enveloped us through the years. The crucifix above the door was definitely not my choice in regards to styling my room, though my mother insisted—making sure I had some piece of 'protection' in my space, whether I liked it or not.

Funny enough, I'm starting to think she's right—maybe I always have.

Somehow, at some point in the night, my mind felt at ease as it was diverted from the unsettling presence within the four walls of my apartment. Sleep eventually crept into my senses, just to pull me under. Another night had gone by, and another was waiting at the other end, while I stayed pliant, letting it tackle me rather than it being the other way around.

Despite barely making it through the night, I still had to attend classes, and this time, getting out of bed felt like I was about to climb Everest with my only gear being a pickaxe. Dragging myself to the bathroom, I realized how little attention I'd given to self-care for the past weeks. The unshaven stubble creeping along my jawline and the dark shadows beneath my eyes were tell-tale signs of 'letting myself go,'.

Yes, it was clear I'd been through the wringer, although a part of me hoped that, if people knew what I'd been dealing with these past few weeks, they might cut me some slack—or at the very least, leave me alone.

Even though I wasn't in the right shape—mentally or physically—I forced myself to class. How I wished I had just stayed home, but a part of me desperately wanted to get away from that place too. Funny enough, that's what drove me the most to leave in the first place, whether I wanted to acknowledge the fact or not. I kept telling myself, *"It's the last day before break, then you're home free,"* but deep down, even then I knew the reason was simply to be separated from my apartment.

Away from the form that had continuously drained and sucked out energy from me every single day. For what reason? I wish I had known then too.

The drive to campus didn't take too long, about thirty minutes of a drive from my apartment building—getting a parking spot wasn't that tough either, since I would always park on a certain area, and had usual spots I'd stop to when it's not too crowded.

Our campus' architecture intrigued me from the first time I got here—due to its historical background establishing itself millenniums ago the campus had a rich traditional architecture featuring classic red-brick facades and Romanesque revival elements, mirroring the university's historical past—blending in the present's modernity as time consistently passed by.

Multiple historical buildings, different halls built during different eras, now being kept alive by sharing one umbrella of maintenance—modernity.

Over time, I understood why older buildings required more maintenance and why they're more crucial to upkeep, in comparison to newly built ones. As parts are replaced, new ones get old, and the cycle continues—which is normal. It only becomes a problem when left unattended for too long.

Passing through a cluster of students, I observed the different types of personalities that littered the campus. Though the majority minded their own business—getting to wherever they needed to go—I still found it intriguing and a little dystopian to see certain individuals sticking their phones anywhere to film a video, whether to dance in front of a camera or film others without consent.

It bothered me to be in the frame of someone else's lens, unable to control how I looked whilst a group of friends minded their own business—presumably filming or taking photos of themselves. It didn't help that I knew I looked like shit at the moment either. I knew I could've just been overreacting; I could even tell that I felt aggravated as I forced myself to go to class. I should've had the option to just stay at home, but even that didn't feel comfortable to me—given my situation at home.

Alas, I powered through—or at least tried to. I survived my classes for the afternoon before spending the rest of my day at the campus library, scouring the shelves in search of something good to read. I hadn't found anything that piqued my interest yet as I walked through the halls that had barely any signs of life. It was the last day of school, so I assumed the other students didn't really have much work to do anymore.

Despite the librarian's 'No Eating' policy, I roamed the plush-carpeted halls with a chicken sandwich in hand. My eyes darting around the different genres, the smell of books, both new and old tickled my senses as I used my free hand to browse quickly through the lightly-dusted books.

As I passed by the mystery novels showcased on bookshelves, I began to go through the horror genre, littered with niche books and familiar titles I'd seen in movies, but what really caught my eye that afternoon was something that's still lingers in my mind, even to this day.

***'Dii Inferi Subter'***

Gods Down Below—it roughly translated to, finding it out down the line. When I held the book in my palms, I felt its weight in my hand. I had no real interest in the occult or supernatural literature, but with its leather material against my skin, I felt compelled to see what was inside. I think, at that moment, a part of me yearned to get answers to things I couldn't explain.

With my sandwich half-eaten, I sauntered to the corner table by the window to read, natural sunlight shining on the pages. The book's hardcover felt matte and leathery, its edges reinforced with rusted metallic triangles that were sharp to the touch, while an engraved insignia—representing the sky, water, and earth—adorned the center of the cover.

Sitting down, I hesitated to open the book, but it was the first step I took trying to find out more about the hauntings I've experienced at home, and this book was going to be one of the many I had opened up in this library, digging through its pages hoping to find something I haven't already been told online.

I had no luck with the first book, but it was only the beginning. I skimmed through every occult book and page I could get my hands on in the library that pertained to the supernatural. Stacks upon stacks of books piled up on the table before me as I searched for any details or signs that even hinted at resembling the occurrences I'd encountered in my apartment.

Feeling pretty defeated, I realized that time had slipped away from me during my hours spent diving into books in the campus library. The sun was no longer beaming through the window. I sighed, resting my head on my arm, my eyes drifting into nothingness—until they focused on an open book I had set aside earlier.

Curious, I sat up and looked at the page I had forgotten open, after giving up on searching for answers in that very book at some point earlier.

I was met with an illustration depicting what seemed to be a mermaid. Her tail glistened with scales that embellished its length, blending into her sharp, emaciated upper body. The fleshy skin on her form transitioned into darker-toned, iridescent scales down her limbs. Her complexion was taut and blueish-grey, with sea mold and barnacles blemishing her skin, resembling a drowned corpse, dead-lost at sea, toned-pale as the storm clouds looming above the ocean. Her milky-white eyes resembled an angler fish—ghostly blind yet all-seeing—peering into the minds and souls around her.

It unsettled me to look into her eyes, and even more so at her facial features, which held the haunting presence of a woman with anger and rage simmering beneath the expression she held blank.

Her webbed fingers, human-like in nature, tipped with razor-sharps nails, while atop her head rested a bed of corals, protruding from the top of her forehead and very scalp, parting the long drab flowing hair that cascaded down her back in streaks of ginger. It seemed whatever rested above her was a permanent crown—twisted and jagged spires resembling horns of a demon.

Yet, the rest of her haunting features almost paled comparison to the bloodied stubs behind her back. Six grotesque, opened flesh wounds—stretched and gaping on her petite frame as whatever inhabited her backside was ripped out of her frail body to reveal torn flesh and peeking the bones of her ribcage, forcing her to wander earth eternally from her opened wound that will never cease to stop its bleeding.

Looking at the illustration on the book, I reeled back, overwhelmed and clearly unsettled, I read the calligraphic words below.

*"Pelagora"*

I muttered almost questioning, unknowing of the entity presented by the book, before turning to the next page, seeing it adorned with information and presumably the background of this supposed entity. My interest has been piqued, drawn to know more about this creature—though short-lived as my phone had vibrated in my pocket, my familiar ringtone snapped me out of my readied trance to dive into the pages.

*"Mom,"* I read on the screen, my hand holding onto the phone with a careful grip.

Tapping the screen to answer, I held the phone to my ear as I briefly checked the front of the book to read its title once more: *Dii Inferi Subter*

*"Hi Mom, whats up?"* I asked, turning the book back to its current page.

My mother had asked me about my day. I gave her the usual preset answer I would resolve to, just to keep the conversation going; the fewer questions asked, the less worry I'd have to burden her with, and the faster I could bid farewell and move on.

Don't get me wrong, I love my mother, and I appreciate that she's reaching out to check-in on me, as she's the only one that's actually made an effort to reach out to me in my family. Though, like any concerned mother, she has her quirks, and by quirks I mean she had a tendency to be overbearing, though at least she cared about me—at times a little too much, which causes for conversations not needed to be had.

*"You need to start eating and taking care of yourself better; you're not a child anymore, Joshua. I shouldn't have to keep reminding you of these things; you need to be aware of these yourself."*

After talking about plans for the family gathering during Christmas, I had mentioned to her I haven't filled up my fridge in weeks and had takeout the other night—so I was looking forward to having homecooked meals that weren't prepared by a college kid with low-cooking skills. I regretted bringing it up almost instantaneously as she began to school me thousands of miles away, at the other end of the phone.

*"Do you still smoke? I don't want to keep lecturing you over and over about these things; you should know better by now. The last thing I want for you is to be having complications when you're older because you couldn't be responsible for yourself by controlling these habits of yours."*

I let out a sigh, forgetting about the book before me, as I laid my head on my palms, with my elbow propped against the table. It was getting tiring having to be told off by my parents, and this wasn't an uncommon thing either, especially then when I still lived under the same roof as them.

When I had the chance to finally move away and be my own person for once, I've never felt so liberated; the first few months felt like a high—the freedom was intoxicating, and eventually, after a year or so, the novelty had worn off. Although reminiscing about that time could still put a smile on my face, as I could remember just blasting music in my apartment, leaving the dishes out to be washed eventually as I busied myself with other things without being nagged at—most importantly, being free to make mistakes, to make decisions without worrying about what others or what my parents would think.

A part of me longed for that familiar feeling again; it was no wonder why I felt frustrated and sad with the state my apartment was in; what was once a sanctuary to me that held pleasant memories of my own was now reduced to a space I couldn't even stand to be in anymore.

*"Look, I'm just doing my job as your mother. I'm looking out for you, and whether you like it or not, I will enforce these things on you to give you a better life."*

She spoke sternly, and I nodded as if she could see me—realizing she couldn't, so I just hummed.

*"I know Mom, and... I am trying; I just had a lot on my plate with... school."* I lied.

*"I'm sure, sweetie; it's alright. Since you're on your winter break for now, get here as soon as you can, okay?"*

I hummed once more, my eyes dragging down to the open pages of the book, my fingers trailing on the words—feeling the rough worn surface of the paper on my skin, its rich-aged tanned color marked with jet-black ink across its pages.

*"Alright, take care, Joshua. Love you."* She spoke calmly.

*"Love you too, Mom."*

Silence permeated my space as I let out a quiet sigh, glancing around the mess I had caused in the library. I brushed off whatever weight I held on my shoulders at the moment as I closed the book—setting it aside before I returned the other stacks of books, so I could have it checked out, to continue reading it at another time at home.

It felt a little odd when I tried to check out the book with Mrs. Auriel. When I arrived at her desk, she was gone—presumably on break or somewhere else. I wasn't sure what to do, so I waited for her; but after fifteen minutes had passed and she still hadn't returned, I settled with just leaving a note with my library card information and the book's title. It was then that I realized it had no author's name listed anywhere, but since the title seemed distinct enough, I figured it would be sufficient for identification.

When I arrived home, the air... it felt different, lighter, maybe? I wasn't sure how to describe the feeling. With my backpack slung over my shoulder, I made my way to my room, retreating within the confines of those four walls that now felt like the safest place on earth.

I opened the book, skimming through the different entities just to catch a glimpse of the illustrations. Naturally, I searched these names on the web, and almost all of them yielded results; it seemed some of these demons also appeared in other demonology texts. I was hooked, to say the least—spending a good few hours researching and diving into these entities and their backgrounds.

From demons that haunted the minds of men across time and history—causing mayhem and despair to bring their master of all masters one step closer to his ultimate goal in the underworld—to demons of decay, malicious beings lurking in the shadows before ultimately claiming a host, and demons of fire, said to haunt charred landscapes and relics of forgotten battles. Each of these unholy creatures held twisted, otherworldly illustrations, seemingly depicted by the unfortunate victims who discovered their forms, whether in the physical or unnatural plane.

In this book, the only demon or entity that held no record in the digital world was the being named *'Pelagora'*. My eyes locked onto her illustration once more, recalling the image I'd seen at whilst at the library. Flipping onto the next page, I was met with the familiar account of her history I had glossed over while on the phone with my mother.

My brows furrowed as I delved deeper into the words of the pages; I felt a strange pity for her. Her haunting appearance made more and more sense as I absorbed the information from the texts.

. . .

**Pelagora**  
/peh-luh-GOH-rah/  
*Pelagora, Mar'gorael, The Siren*

*Mother of all mothers, daughter of all daughters; Pelagora is a fallen deity, cursed to roam the seven seas for her transgressions against the divine holiest of them all.*

Once a seraphim, Mar'gorael—a high-ranking angel—was seated in Heaven's court among the most revered beings in the kingdom. Amidst the sea of clouds, this angel bore a masculine form, embodying strength, power, and wisdom. He radiated a transcendent beauty and possessed an ethereal voice, a gift from the Creator of all creators. Most of his existence was spent by the throne with his fellow angels, reverently singing praises that echoed throughout the heavenly plains above the earth.

The angel's wandering gaze would become its demise; witnessing the atrocities of man—watching the innocent shrivel as collateral damage; women, children, and the vulnerable, all susceptible to an endless parade of war and cruelty throughout history and time. Mar'gorael questioned the purpose of their suffering—questioned the decisions of God.

As its three pairs of wings descended from their heavenly perch—from heaven, down to earth—it was the angel's unfurling mistake that came next. In an act of defiance, it cast judgment on a man who raised his hand against his own family, wielding wrath according to its own understanding of justice. That choice—the act of enforcing wrath by its own will—was a betrayal of the very balance it was meant to preserve.

For daring to interfere, the angel was cast out—Mar'gorael's radiant form twisted by the fires of its fall, all six wings ripped from the bone by awaiting demons lurking beyond heaven's borders, forced to scatter across the regions of earth. The angel's form tore through the atmosphere, catching fire as it singed the remaining tattered divine fabrics before plummeting into the unknown depths of the sea.

Banished to a liminal space, the angel's compassion simmered and curdled into a dark hatred for mankind, a hunger and lust for rebellion, from being casted out of divinity; spared from hell, and trapped in an eternal prison in-between. Yearning for a world free from suffering, shaped in its own image, Mar'gorael lay dormant as time aged the world—until, at last, it assumed a new form: The Siren.

. . .

I couldn't help but feel pity as I looked at the illustration of the entity, seeing the deeper meaning behind the scars and deterioration etched into her depiction. Pelagora, the embodiment of a woman scorned, with empty eyes that held an untold story, buried in the deepest depths of the ocean—chained to coral on the seabed, her abandoned form left to be forgotten by time, trapped for eternity.

When it came to religion, I understood there were nuances to almost everything. Here was a being once exalted to one of divinity's highest forms, meticulously crafted by the hand of God, now cast out with eternal damnation and ultimately abandoned by her own creator.

It's a concept familiar to many—a story once told before. Yet, it seemed even heaven wasn't immune to history repeating itself.

Knowing what I knew, it felt... wrong. It didn't feel fair. Despite everything I'd been taught to believe, I found myself pitying the entity. If bringing justice to the helpless meant taking matters into your own hands, wouldn't the answer be clear if one had a righteous heart?

A part of me feared the radical altruism festering in that thought, now sensing a pair of eyes watching me from the shadows.

I glanced up at the dimly illuminated cross nearby, turning my head to look at it from where I sat at my desk. The warm glow of my lamp shone against the sleek, hardened skin of Christ on the crucifix, dotted with painted blood. His sorrowful eyes seemed to look back at me, and I felt a rush of accusatory guilt run down my spine.

Yet, it all seemed to wash away as soon as my mind registered a loud thud and the sound of footsteps from the other side of my bedroom wall. I knew that the space beyond where my bedframe rested was no longer part of my flat. My gaze fixed itself on that side of the room as silence slowly seeped back in.

Standing up, I approached the wall. As I drew closer, the sounds grew louder—murmured voices weaving through the silence.

Pressing my ear against the cold surface of the wall, I strained to catch any hint of a voice. I knew I must've looked... odd, especially if seen from a second perspective view—but understand that I was sure, no, confident, that the other side of this wall was the adjacent flat, apartment 506.

The voices grew almost clearer now, though still muffled, the conversation barely decipherable through the thin structure of the wall serving as a barrier between two spaces. This building truly was old; I sometimes forget it has been built almost a whole millennia ago.

*"Hector, hurry! Jenny, Mila and Andrew are already up in the ceiling!*" A woman called out with urgency, strain evident in her tone.

*"We all can't fit in there Josephine!"* The man replied back, grunting and coughing.

*"Mom, Dad, its stuck!"* A teenage voice spoke out, struggle evident in his call, as if pulling a heavy object, immovable in its current state. He coughed, his breath coming in wheezes, matching the labored breathing of the older man nearby.

*"I-I have to go check on the Mila and the kids, I can't leave them up there! I want to make sure they make it-"* Her words cut off as a sharp crackling of splintering wood rang out, from what seemed to have been coming from the ceiling at the other side of the wall. It soon followed a loud thud, the sound of her pained groans caused the two other voices to panic.

*"Mom!"*

*"Oh my God, Josephine!"* the older man cried out, his footsteps pounding away from the younger voice, moving closer to where the crash had come from.

*"Nico, don't look... I said don't fucking look!"* The man's voice, once firm, broke into a fit of anguished sobs.

With furrowed brows, my palms began to sweat against the dry wall as I listened intently, catching the sobs of what was now clear to me, seemed to be a son and a father. The boy continued to plead, his voice shaking as he begged for reassurance about his mother, their coughing growing harsher as the boy's cries intensified.

*"I-I shouldn't have been giving her hell for these past few days for losing Joseph. I can only imagine the pain and guilt your mother has been feeling... Instead of just being the man she needed I just weighed more on her burden."* The father's anguished wails seeped through the wall, the timbre of his throaty sobs felt guttural.

*"We'll find him Dad, no matter what it takes... but first we have to get out of here."*

The pair's footsteps audibly moved around as shoes on wooden floor squeaked and thumped. Their voices unintelligible the further they moved away. The faint sounds turned to whispers, and, from whispers to a familiar silence once more, leaving me frozen with my ear against the wall. The tender flesh of my cheek remained frozen on cold surface, as I struggled to pull myself from the trance, trying to process what had just transpired.

I debated calling emergency services—after all, a woman might be dead on the other side of this wall. Initially I had thought the next apartment over was 506, but what if I was wrong? What if it was a different apartment attached to the other side?

I found myself grasping at straws, trying to rationalize an occurrence once more, but at this point it was too real; not to say the previous occurrences didn't feel real enough, I've just buried—or attempted to forget them for the sake of my sanity, and to continue living in my apartment.

Standing there, facing the wall, I realized I had been staring blankly, as if watching paint dry. I continued to gather my thoughts right then and there, as I felt a weight on my chest slowly ease up while I inched closer to conclusion within myself, to finally stop tiptoeing along the lines.

Something happened to that apartment, adjacent to mine, and the secrets locked behind that front door—I don't think I would ever be ready to find out.

After an uneventful weekend, Monday morning had arrived, and so did I—though in a puddle of sweat. I barely could recall the dream I had that night when I went to bed. I just remembered feeling hot, I couldn't see anything but the darkness, just the all-consuming darkness—but what made up for my lack of sight was the intense feeling of smoldering heat that enveloped my body.

It felt as if I was in hell, the screams and cries of voices I could not see, while the crackling wails of agony felt like a cacophony of begging—pleading for the torment to stop.

When I woke up, I gasped for air, my chest heaving as if I'd just surfaced after being submerged underwater for too long. Sitting upright in bed, I realized I hadn't woken from the dream—I'd been pulled from it. I couldn't recall whether my body had done it on purpose to wake me up, or I was so deeply entranced that my mind had forgotten to breathe.

Trying to shake it off as a passing occurrence, I stepped out of my room. Upon checking my phone I then noticed the voice messages I'd received from Mr. Grant. Judging by the timestamps, it had been about half an hour since he sent out the messages.

*"It's Monday kid, I'm coming over this afternoon, if you're heading out, let me know beforehand so I can get the spare key before going to your apartment."* his voice crackled through the phone's speaker. He sounded slightly muffled due to the outdoor ambiance and the wind blowing onto him while recording the message.

*"I'm on my way now to check on the other apartments on that floor. Just your luck right? When I promised last week I'd come over on Monday, I actually*—*"*

The message cut off abruptly. I replayed it out of habit, but it didn't offer any new insight. After playing the recorded messages, I gave him a brief text, letting him know I wasn't going to be home, and then I turned off my phone to begin to head out. I didn't really wanna stick around and have to deal with Mr. Grant, knowing him he'll be talking to talk, and I'm not really in the mood to go through that with my social battery being at an all-time low.

I noticed that the dripping had minimized from the air-conditioner, watching the droplets of water dribble onto the bucket half-filled with ventilation discharge, the water was still mold-ridden and stunk-rotten, at least at this point I had gotten used to the smell. None of that all of that didn't matter anymore—Mr. Grant was going to come in and he was going to fix the problem as promised. All I needed to do was get out of his way.

After emptying the foul-smelling bucket, it didn't take long for me to get ready. I planned to run a few errands, maybe grab some breakfast, and finally stock up on groceries. I hadn't been keeping up with much around the apartment lately; with everything going on, I've been procrastinating more than usual.

At least now that I had the chance to, I felt pretty optimistic that I was taking charge of my day for once, rather than the other way around.

As I locked my apartment door, my attention drifted to the one next to mine, noticing that the once-sealed, locked entrance was now slightly ajar—all I could see through the parted crack was darkness.

I stared at the open crack longer than I should have, torn between curiosity and the creeping dread tightening around my chest, that engulfed the sense of safety I thought I had. Part of me knew I should turn away, with my feet lifting to maneuver backward—lost in a plethora of thoughts and contemplations, by the time I formed a cohesive thought, I already stood in the middle of the apartment.

Standing in the dimly lit open space, I sensed a distorted familiarity as the layout of the apartment was a mirrored version of mine. The light from outside the main hallway illuminated the area, giving me a better look at the state of the apartment. Its walls singed black, burnt marks trailing from the bottom, and upwards—windows taped over blind, keeping even the barest hint of light outside from ever peeking in, to bless the gloomy space with its warm glow.

A lingering stench was powerful, overtaking my senses as I covered my nose with my forearm. The smell of rot and burnt ash was too pungent for my nose to simply breathe in the room naturally. I felt my eyes water as I walked around the empty apartment, glancing at the littered garbage and burnt clumps of ashes. My eyes landed on a white sofa toasted on its edges resembling a dirty marshmallow, it was kept against the wall, undoubtedly abandoned and left by its previous owners, it piqued my interest, not because of its odd state, but what lay adjacent to the abandoned furniture.

Groceries... clean, almost fresh, and unopened items laid waste near the couch. With my footsteps crunching against burnt remnants on the floor, I walked to check closely. Crouching down, I picked up a container of ice cream, the pint-sized cookie dough-flavored treat laid flat on my palm as the weak light from the open door served to illuminate. My thumb grazed over the dust and debris on the bottom of the pint, reading its printed numbers.

*Best by: 03/2023*

Feeling the warm pint of ice cream slip from my grasp, it toppled onto the floor. It was mine—I had bought it not long ago earlier this month, and it disappeared with some of the groceries I kept in the fridge. I glanced at the pile of miscellaneous groceries, scattered items pooled on the dirty floor, once I turned on the flashlight of my phone. I scanned through the ruined apartment for any other semblance of familiarity. I felt a sickening nervousness at the pit of my stomach, as I began to question...

*'did someone have access to my apartment?'*

The thought that someone had been coming in, taking my groceries, and walking through my halls at night while I was locked up in my room. I felt a strong unnerving sense deep in my throat, trickling down to my stomach—violation was all I felt by the thought that someone lived with me, right under my nose this whole time.

My displeased gaze drifted to a piece of paper, littered with what looked to be a childish drawing of a family. Six drawn figures blacked out with ink, with their distinct features, barely seen through the marker's scribble, except one drawing of a short toddler in blue. Before I could even register or make out what it could've meant, the creaking of a door from down the dark hall permeated my senses, echoing throughout the space as the door slowly inched wider to open, what lay behind the barely lit door was complete and utter darkness—pitch black.

I felt as if my brain was locked in fight or flight mode, as I chose the latter—always have, and ran. I got up sprinting to the front door, as I could've sworn the door was slowly closing in on its own, catching it before it fully clamped shut. Slamming the apartment door closed with a harsh pull with my bare hands, and the loud thud echoed around the commercially bright-lit hallway, nothing but the beat of my own heart pumping against my chest, accompanied by the pants from my dry throat, permeated the silence in the hall.

I could've stayed—I would've stayed in the building, gone back to my apartment, and locked myself in my room once again, but knowing what I knew—or at least speculated on for the past few hours since leaving. I knew I wasn't safe there either, whatever, or whoever was in 506, knew that I was there, that I saw my groceries, and whatever junk laid out in that abandoned apartment.

Fearing that whatever I ran away from could be waiting for me in my apartment. I stayed outside, letting time pass by inside a cafe to gather my thoughts and use their free Wi-Fi. Trying to make sense of what was going on felt like an impossible goal. I wasn't sure how to look for help, without sounding completely nuts. I thought about calling the cops, or telling the landlord, and maintenance, but what would I say?

*'I think someone is living in my walls or the abandoned apartment next to mine, please send help'*

I pondered that rehearsed line and thought heavily about alerting the proper authorities, but with shaking hands, I couldn't bring myself to do it, to call and ask for help. I wasn't a stranger in doing so, I've asked for help and assistance before— but the thought of having to explain the situation to the landlord, and Mr. Grant, I felt unreasonably unnerved.

Left with one option—I had to talk to the only person I knew, with more knowledge about the building than most, the person I could only trust in this beaten-down old structure full of unspoken history within its renovated walls—I needed to talk to Mr. Jobert. Though, despite my regarded closeness with the man, I still couldn't help but overthink what he would say, and how he would react.

*'He wouldn't think I was crazy, would he? I mean... he fought a sea creature for Christ's sake, he should be the last person to judge, right?'*

With my knuckles repeatedly thumping on the hardwood planes of the mahogany door, I felt a sense of urgency in my knocks, whether purposely or otherwise. My chest constructed within itself, feeling the need to see a familiar face; it felt foreign to me to yearn for human connection, but when faced with something beyond myself in that moment—a grumbling sensation bubbled rattling my bones, feeling a numbing itch down my throat I couldn't scratch—as my body vehemently tried stopping itself from uttering a word I felt afraid to speak.

*"Help."*
