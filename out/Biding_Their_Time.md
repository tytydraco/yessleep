Millions of years ago, the world was ruled by giant reptilian beasts known as dinosaurs. They were the dominant species on the planet, with fearsome teeth, powerful jaws, and razor-sharp claws. But as we all know, their reign was cut short by a catastrophic asteroid impact, which caused mass extinction and wiped out most life on Earth.

Or so we thought.

As it turns out, a small group of dinosaurs managed to survive the cataclysm by burrowing deep underground. They were a resourceful and adaptable race, with an innate ability to sense danger and adapt to new environments. Over the centuries, they evolved into a highly-intelligent super race of reptilians, with advanced technology and a deep hatred for humanity.

These underground dinosaurs, known as the Krynn, had been planning their revenge for millennia. They had watched from the shadows as humans rose to power, building their cities and dominating the planet. They had observed our wars and our follies, our greed and our destruction. And they had grown disgusted with our arrogance and our ignorance.

But they knew that the time was not yet right. They bided their time, building their strength and their weapons, perfecting their strategies and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They knew that they had to be patient and methodical, for they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned by the humans above.

And so they waited, deep beneath the earth, plotting and scheming, building their armies and their machines, honing their skills and their tactics. They knew that they were a superior race, with greater intelligence, greater strength, and greater resilience than the fragile humans above. And they knew that when the time came, they would emerge from the darkness and conquer the surface world.

That time, it seemed, was fast approaching. The Krynn had detected a shift in the tectonic plates, a sign that the planet was entering a new era of upheaval and chaos. They had also discovered a weakness in the human defenses, a vulnerability that would allow them to strike with devastating force and cripple the human civilization.

And so they prepared for war. They drilled their troops, tested their weapons, and fine-tuned their plans. They knew that the human armies would be no match for their advanced technology and their superior tactics. They knew that they would crush the humans without mercy, and take their rightful place as rulers of the planet.

The day of reckoning was at hand. The Krynn emerged from their underground lairs, their eyes blazing with hatred and their scales gleaming in the sunlight. The humans watched in horror as the creatures they thought were extinct attacked with ruthless precision, slaughtering millions and leaving nothing but death and destruction in their wake.

It was a massacre, a holocaust, a nightmare come to life. The Krynn were unstoppable, their strength and intelligence far beyond anything the humans could imagine. They conquered the cities, enslaved the survivors, and established a new order on the planet.

And as they looked down upon the shattered remnants of the human civilization, they felt a sense of satisfaction and triumph. They had achieved what their ancestors had failed to do - they had conquered the world, and established a new age of reptilian dominance. And they knew that they would rule for eons to come, as the ultimate super race of the planet.
