2020, the coronavirus starts, everything shuts down. I had just gotten over someone and was planning on being done with love for a while. Then I saw someone, someone I thought was the cutest person I'd ever seen. I instantly had to find out who they were and I showed my mom them right away.  I instantly started liking them, they made me feel crazy like I never had before. It was more serious than it ever had been. Very soon early on things started getting bad, I was having problems with them and they were way too much for me. 

Then I did something with them, something significant that really effected me very badly. I was emotionally attached to a person in a way I had never been before and on the last night of April I believe because of the stress I had  been under or more likely my gerd, I  was literally so stressed everyday I felt nauseous and my entire body tense,  just couldn't wait to go to sleep to get away from the stress, I had what felt like a heart attack . 


It was that night and I was feeling very stressed, my heart started pounding out of my chest, like it was going to explode and it didn't stop for a very long time. I'm not exaggerating when I say it was pounding out of my chest, it was going super fast and my mom could hear it. The next day, I woke up feeling completely drained and was convinced it had been a heart attack and I was laid up on the couch. I felt so guilty of my sin aswell.  


This extreme fatigue lasted for months and I had several more "heart attacks" and was laid up for months very heartbroken and stressed over my first super serious feelings I had for someone. I tried to get super religious, I tried to paint, draw, even tried to force myself to have feelings for someone else. It all came to a head on August 2nd, I was so sick of worrying about my heart attack and death and my feelings about them that I decided to watch a "prayer video on youtube" of a man claiming to do miracles, and many in the comments said they 
 expierenced miracles from him. 


I did the prayer and instantly felt a spirit take over me, it took control of me and I felt this unexplainable spiritual feeling which was not pleasant. I went to make the shape of a angel out of food, but soon realized I did not any longer have any free will. 


This felt horrible and I remember having some kind of trouble thinking of Jesus and ever since then I have been completely demonically possessed. I have since gained my "free will" and it does not control me in the literal since like that but It does many unexplainable spiritual things, I have "tics" where I will uncontrollably say I love the devil and it changes my personality completely, but the biggest things are the spiritual things I simply cannot explain, like the constant feeling inside of my body that is not mental or physical but its literally a devil inside of me. This is not mental illness, I know the day I invited the devil in. 


 was expienicng mental illness and depression before and yes the devil has also caused some of those symptoms too but not in the normal human ways in ways all realted to the devil.  Sometimes I randomly have spurts saying I love Satan, accidentally. At one point I was having to say devil in my mind constantly to feel any sort of comfort. I have been pressured to rebuke the holy spirit and did say that in my mind because of this demonic thing.

I have laughed in a creepy clown like laugh to cope with it, because of it making me so angry and sung songs about demonic things in a creepy clown voice, sounds goofy but I was doing it out of upset not to be funny.    I have had a resistance to the name Jesus at times, and had a very hard time calling Jesus my lord and savior, feel very uncomfortable at his name.


At other times, it tricked me into thinking it was making me closer to him. It has possibly gave me knowledge of things, I would always feel the vibe and know when someone was a witch, many unexplainable things have happened, like a entire atmosphere glitch around me and it was like my mind glitched too and so did my device one time.  I thought "if your real my period will stop" to the demon, and my period stopped for months. Lots of crazy things, all because of one video, one thing I can say is even possessed I never got over that one person. It's crazy because now they are 21, and I'm still 16. 


16 in a nineteen year old body, I have missed years of my life because they were taken from me by the devil. So many people say "the devil this, the devil that" but most of the time they are blaming their own human problems on the devil, well I can say my problems have really been the devil and I wish they were still only human.  

So many cases of "possession " probably the biggest account are mental illness, bad behavior or some sort of physical illness, but the actual very rare cases are not believed by most. when I'm not possessed anymore I wonder if I will remember anything of it or will it be like I'm in a new place I never seen before? I don't know but I'm getting rid of them devil soon, using the basic tools from the bible. So this is me, singing off, your real possessed girl, Anna.
