“You actually bought it, didn’t you?”

The daggered sting of my girlfriend’s eyes pierced my back as I fumbled the package inside and into the foyer. My dog Max continued barking from the recent sound of the doorbell 

“Easy, bud.”

I reassured him with a pet and grunted with the effort of stretching my arms to carry the wide package by myself into the hallway.

“Yeah, I bought it.”

“The last one you showed me that’s super creepy? That one?”

“The one and the same.”

“Why?”

After scooting the painting near the intended wall space, I turned to face her.

“Cams, c’mon. I told you this already. It’s possibly haunted!”

She crossed her arms with a defiant stare, which I mimicked with an eyebrow raise.

“I hate it when you call me that. I’d even take Camilla over Cams.”

“Okay, Cammy. Sheesh.” Max barked once again. “Hey, hey. Easy.”

“You don’t even care that I hate it, do you? Does that mean nothing to you?”

“Look, you’re creeped out by it and that’s fine, but that’s what makes it so interesting! It’s supposed to be creepy. It’s a haunted painting!”

I pulled the painting out of the box, but the awkward size caused me to almost drop it. To my surprise, Cammy helped me.

“Really? I thought you hated it.”

“Ugh, let’s just see it hung up. Get this over with.”

We removed the painting and cut off the layer of protective paper between the box and panting. After holding it up to the wall, I beamed.

“Gonna be a good fit, don’t you think?”

“I still hate it.”

The scene was surreal, depicting warped destitute people crawling away from something unknown. A child was featured with tears streaming down his face. There was an obvious undertone of red as if a thin undercoat had been applied. It was just as foreboding as it was enigmatic.

“Look, it’s fine. They listed it as a haunted painting to make it sell better.”

“Do you really think its haunted?”

“I duuno, but I hope so.”

“You’re so stupid. And weird…but that’s sorta why I like you.”

She punctuated this with a kiss. With her help, we managed to get the strange painting up in the hallway and I’m not gonna lie, it looked even better than I anticipated. I flung my arm around her neck, and Cammy leaned into me. Perhaps all was forgiven.

“Let’s step away from our haunted painting for a moment and get some lunch.”

On our way to the kitchen, we jumped at the sound of something striking the side of our house. I ran outside to find a bird had flown hard into the brick exterior and broke its neck. Cammy gave me a hard stare.

“See? Things are getting interesting already.”

“I hate it already.”

I smiled and tried my best to hide it, but deep down I knew this may be more than I bargained for…

 

 

That night, we were heading to bed and I noticed the absence of our loyal companion.

“Max?”

About to turn into the bedroom, I heard my dog’s nails click back and forth in the hallway behind me, but he didn’t approach. I flicked the hallway light back on and Max kept eye contact while pacing to the left and right. It seemed like he wanted to move forward but couldn’t compel himself to.

“Hey, what’s wrong, buddy?”

I walked towards him and knelt down to give him a chest rub. He looked back and forth from me to the hallway, his eyes pleading for understanding.

“What is it? What’s bothering you, huh?”

His gaze stopped long enough for me to locate the source of his stress. I got chills for a second.

*His eyes were locked on to the painting.*

“Yeah..there’s scary faces on it, I know.”

This was meant more for my own comfort than his, but I would have never admitted it. My girlfriend stuck her head in the hallway and watched on.

“Okay, bud c’mon. Can’t leave you out here.”

I gave him a little nudge toward our bedroom, but he didn’t move.

“C’mon, work with me here. “

I grabbed his collar and pulled him towards me, but he wouldn’t budge. He even yanked his head back and slipped his collar. All the while he never took his eyes off that painting.

“You’re shitting me…it’s the panting, isn’t it?”

“Oh, come off it. Dogs are really good at recognizing human expression which is one of the reasons they know when something’s wrong with us. He sees those distorted faces and it bothers him.”

“Yeah, maybe. But never seen him act like *that.* Ever*.”*

I hated to admit, but she had a good point. After a couple more attempts, I gave up as Max had made his choice known. Poor guy was completely terrified of the thing. It may have just been my imagination, but I thought I felt a cold chill when I passed the painting on my way to the bedroom.

“I do *not* like that thing.”

“I heard you the first time, sheesh. But yeah, it’s kinda weird. It was a weird day, don’t worry about it. Max will get used to it.”

Before going into the bedroom, I shot Max one last glance.

“Last call.”

As if he completely understood, he laid down with his head between his paws and let out a defiant grunt.

“Okay, fine. I’ll leave the door open if you change your mind.”

Without incident, we settled for bed and apparently I was more tired than I realized. I’m usually a night owl but I very quickly fell asleep.

 

A sound jolted me awake, and in my stupored state I swore a bark had woken me up.

“Max?”

The sound of paws clicking against hardwood resounded in the dark, and I almost jumped at the cold muzzle brushing my hand. It was something I never got used to no matter how many times he did it, but this was how he told us he needed to go out.

“Okay, boy. Gimme a sec.”

I patted the floor for my sandals with my feet and slipped them on. This was one of those mindless routines you do a million times on autopilot. Our house was in a quiet neighborhood so the only sounds were my sandals flopping on the wood floor and Max’s panting.

When I reached the thermostat in the foyer, I rubbed my arms while I checked it.

“Geez, it’s freezing in here and it’s July.”

The thought of the haunted painting came to mind, and I was somehow excited at the thought despite how terrifying that could be.

*What the hell was wrong with me?* I was a glutton for punishment…

After closing the thermostat’s cover, I started to turn back towards the front door when I heard a growl.

“Max?”

I flicked on the foyer light to find him cowering at the front door with his haunches up.

“Hey, hey. It’s just me, c’mon les go—“

Before the words left my mouth, it suddenly dawned on me that it didn’t make sense for Max to be at the front door. I could feel his hairs brushed up against my leg as I was looking at him six feet in front of me.  He’d never left my side the whole time I walked to the foyer. Max bared his teeth and growled towards me, looking more ferocious than I’d ever seen him before.

*What the hell was beside me?*

I didn’t want to look, but I knew I had to. The hairs stood up on my neck as I slowly turned and looked down at a pitch black canine figure with deep red eyes boring into me.

“What the—“

I leapt toward Max with the intention of rushing him outside, but when I looked back to shut the door, the thing was gone.

My heart was beating so fast I had to lean against the wall to catch my breath. My companion licked my hand and whimpered.

“I know buddy, I know. Let’s go out.”

We came back inside and the unnatural cold in the house had subsided along with the eeriness that saturated the air. This painting must be the real deal. But what was I to do now? Could I really get rid of it when it was possibly the most interesting thing I’d ever had? Only time would tell…

 

The next day went surprisingly well with no incident, and it turns out that my girlfriend slept through the whole ordeal with Max at the door. I thought it best not to tell her. No point in feeding her fears right now.

As we were eating dinner that night, I went to get us some snacks for our movie we picked out. Sadly, we were all out.

“It’s not movie night without snacks,” she insisted.

“Yeah, I guess you’re right. I can go grab some real quick. Wanna come with?”

“Nah, I think I’ll stay here. I’m really tired for some reason. Please make it quick, though.”

Her eyes darted back toward the hallway, and I instantly felt guilty. Maybe this painting wasn’t worth it if it made her feel this way. But then again, $150 was a lot for me and I really liked it. I swear sometimes I don’t deserve her...

I grabbed a small pack of popcorn bags from a local corner store and made my way back in about ten minutes, if not a little more. As I turned the key to enter, I instantly felt a wash of dread come over me. Something was off…

“Babe?” I called out as I entered the foyer.

No response.

I stood in the space between our bedroom hallway and our kitchen, noticing that the bathroom at the end of the hall was closed with a light on. She was just in the bathroom and didn’t hear me. That was why it was such a shock when my girlfriend appeared from the den and stood cold in her tracks.

“You…just got back? Like, just now?”

“Yes. And obviously you’re not in the bathroom. You left the light on.”

Tears started welling up in her eyes and she cautiously stepped closer to me.

“Please tell me you’re joking.”

“I’m not…what’s going on?”

“I didn’t go into the bathroom. You did.”

“Really? You wanna scare me back beause you don’t like—“

“Listen to me! You came in just a couple minutes ago and said you had to use the bathroom.”

“Babe, that’s impossible, I…”

My eyes stayed locked on the bathroom door the entire time, and I witnessed a shadow under the door frame moved from behind the door.

“Get Max, run to the car, and call—“

Our bathroom door blew open, banging against the wall with such a force it left a dent. We expected to see something foul and hideous awaiting, but we were greeted by nothing at all. Our eyes met, both wide in fear as we looked back to the bathroom in a vacuum of sound.

The bathroom light suddenly flicked off on its own and footsteps pounded toward us so hard it shook the floor. A disembodied scream from nowhere screeched and Max started losing his mind. Just as the heavy footsteps closed the distance and I thought this invisible force was going to plow into me, the footfalls stopped. There was a silence, then Cammy burst into tears.

She wasn’t ready for this. And I wasn’t prepared for this.

Biting my lip, I ran over to the painting with the intention of taking it off the wall but I couldn’t get a purchase on it. I yelped in pain and rushed to the kitchen sink, running cold water over my hands. Cammy saw that my hands were blistered from an intense heat, as if I’d touched a hot iron skillet.

“What the hell is going on here?” She said through sobs.

“You already know. That thing’s not just haunted, it’s cursed. It’s gotta be.”

“It won’t let you throw it out…maybe it’s protecting itself.”

“Because I bought it.”

We reflected on the situation for a moment, and I decided to message the seller to see if they’d give me a refund. They responded immediately.

*“No. I’m not taking that thing back.”*

*“So you knew it was really haunted.”*

*“I straight up told you it was. It’s done enough to me. Its your now.”*

*“How do I make it…stop?”*

*“You have to sell it to someone else.”*

*“I can’t do that…not in good conscience.”*

*“Then you have to live with it. When you buy this painting, you don’t own* it. It *owns* you*. I’ve had my one month of hell and that was more than enough.*”

I relayed the conversation to Cammy.

“What are we going to do now?” I relented.

Suddenly, her eyes went bright in epiphany.

“So you own it, or it owns you, right?”

“Yeah. That’s what I just said.”

“But *IIIII* don’t.”

An understanding passed between us, and she smiled wide. An angry determination in her, she yanked the horrid painting off the wall and stomped it to fragmented wood frame pieces and shredded paper. We bagged it up and tossed into the trash can outside.

“Trash is tomorrow, so it’ll be gone before you know it.”

“I hope so. I really, really hope so.”

The next day, I got ready and rushed off to work, very satisfied to hear the beep of the garbage truck not far from our street. I worked until 12 and started my break . Halfway through, I was surprised not to hear from Cammy. Alarm bells started going off in my head knowing everything that’d happened until now. I rushed home and found her car still there, calling her phone and getting no answer.

I explained to my work that there was an emergency situation which they gave me no issue on. The police were a bit trickier, as it wasn’t long since I saw her and they wouldn’t even consider doing anything until she hadn’t shown up that night. By then I’d called everyone she knew. Cammy was nowhere to be found.

That night, I couldn’t rest at all from crying and feeling this overwhelming weight of despair that told me Cammy wasn’t okay. By noon the next day, my fears were confirmed.

Police showed up to my house to tell me in person. They got a call from city waste management…Cammy was found crushed to death in the garbage truck’s compactor. There was no evidence to show how or when she got in there. Just the mangled remains of what used to be my girlfriend’s body.

My mind didn’t accept the news completely, it was too awful to bear. I blankly stared back at the officers and thanked them, but for what I’m not sure. I shuffled back into my home and collapsed on the couch, Max giving me what comfort he could.

At some point, something stirred me from my sleep. There were no words for it, just the feeling of something pulling me. Time skipped and I found myself in the hallway staring at what used to be a blank space on my wall.

*It was back*…untouched and in perfect condition, but with one final touch.

The thought of it was nothing short of horrific, but somehow it was comforting at the same time.

Everything was going to be okay, I just had to look on the bright side. I could visit Cammy any time I wanted now, and all I had to do was look at my painting to see her. Her muffled screams from inside the painting were the only sound she made, but still…it made me feel better despite it all…
