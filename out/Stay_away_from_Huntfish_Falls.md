I'm not sure if anyone will read this, and I'm not sure who to tell. I know this sounds nuts. A few days have passed now and we still have no idea what happened and what we saw. If you're thinking of going camping around Huntfish Falls any time soon, don't. I don't know who or what is out there, but I think that whatever is out there might be dangerous, and I don't think it likes strangers.



Lynn's birthday wish is always camping, so that's what we always do. She loves waterfalls so naturally we wanted to find a place where there were some nearby. Many trails were damaged during Hurricane Helene so after a flurry of phone calls and some research we settled on Huntfish Falls. We knew from some recent photos from other hikers that some of the campsites were accessible so we decided to give it a shot. I've camped there twice before in my college years and was somewhat familiar with the area. This trip started out like any other. We would make a list of everything we needed for 2-3 nights in the woods, get everything ready, then review and pack the vehicle the night before. It went smoothly and we woke up at 3AM to hit the road. Around 6 hours and an unsurprising amount of traffic around Raleigh later and we were in the mountains of Western North Carolina. I'm not sure if you've ever had the opportunity to visit the Appalachians but its like a fairy tale during the Spring. Sure its a little damp sometimes, but the trails are dense with vegetation and the smell of the foliage waking from its winter slumber is a sweetness I can't truly describe. Old, smooth, and covered in moss they've always felt mysterious too, not in a scary way, but in a “they have secrets” way. Now I'm certain that they do.



We arrived at the trail head around 1 pm. After reviewing our gear and checklists one more time we hit the trail. It was a gorgeous clear Friday afternoon and even though it was a little muggy from the heat, I was looking forward to the cool evening and a potentially freezing dip in the water. We had also lucked out and there was no one else at the trail head, which means we were unlikely to encounter others unless they came in later in the evening or potentially from another trail. The weather forecast had called for some intermittent rain, but seriously when does it not rain a little during the Spring out there? We were prepared for it, and unless it was torrential; it would only dampen some gear, not our spirits. We kept a strong pace and within an hour we were nearing the one big stream crossing we had to overcome before getting to the campsite. Not super dangerous but there is a spot where you have to either walk through the water, or scramble over a boulder to get to the other side. There isn't a huge fall if you make a mistake, more of a rough slide down one giant rock face. You'd likely walk away with a bruised ego, some scrapes, and bruised ass cheeks. With the rocks being pretty consistently wet its always a little tricky. Carrying a pack with a fair amount of weight makes it even trickier. I went first and went right into the water. I figured that my boots were waterproof and this would allow me to help Lynn across. As soon as my second boot had touched the water I heard a scream and my heart leapt. I spun around to see Lynn putting the invisible fire on her hand out. “Fucking spider, ughhhh!” she screamed again. Apparently when she went to brace herself on a tree for support before stepping out onto the rock, a harmless denizen of the forest had decided to say hello. I started laughing. “Ready to go home?” I joked. “Fuck you!” she laughed back, stepping out on to the boulder and slowly making her way across. The rest of the trek was uneventful, we made it to the campsite shortly after and started to pitch the tent and tarps to prepare for the evening. Usually the order of operations is, set up camp, find firewood, lounge around or explore until dark, make a fire if we need it to cook, then sleep. While Lynn began unpacking our things in the tent I went looking for some firewood. Finding dry firewood in a subtropical climate can be tricky, but because of the damaged and fallen trees from the hurricane there was ample supply. In fact, looking around I noticed that there were fallen trees everywhere, so I didn't think much of the way that they were laying, or how some of them seemed to be arranged in peculiar patterns. I made my way back to the camp site with an armload of firewood. As I approached the camp and laid the wood down Lynn popped out of the tent with a gleaming smile on her face. “Whats for dinner?” she asked. “What would you like?” I answered. “The chili mac or the beef stew” she said as she removed our freeze dried space food from our pack. “Thy will be done my Queen” I replied as I bowed away and fired up the jetboil to boil water. I'm nothing if not a goof ball. Once the food had re-hydrated we tied our hammock up, hopped in and proceeded to chow down. The food is always more delicious after a little hike. We enjoyed a beautiful sunset in the trees, a small fire for smore's, secured the bear bag, and turned in for the evening. Usually I would leave the rain fly off if I'm confident in the weather but with the chance of rain we went ahead and put it on just in case. Waking up to rainfall unprotected is rarely fun.



I was shaken awake a little after midnight by Lynn. “Whats wrong?” I asked. “There's someone outside of the tent” she whispered and fell silent. I retrieved the headlamp in preparation to find out what was going on when I heard the first THUD about ten yards North of the tent. I'm a big guy, I don't scare easily and I jumped. “What the fuck was that?” she asked. “Sounded like a branch fell” I responded and listened for any subsequent sounds. THUD. THUD. This time it sounded as if it came from the South side of the camp. “Its not windy at all” Lynn whispered. “I know” I responded, starting to get a little concerned. *What the fuck could that be?* I wondered to myself as I pulled my shirt on and donned the headlamp. We had spent many nights in the woods, we've heard many sounds. Its not entirely uncommon for dead limbs to fall in the forest, but its certainly more common when its windy and we've now heard three on a windless night. I've scared bears off, They're usually just as scared as I am but this didn't sound like a bear. I maneuvered to the mouth of the tent and prepared to unzip it. Unfortunately I would have to not only open the tent, but also the rain fly I so diligently secured as well. *Fuck me.* I thought to myself I reached for the zipper of the rain fly I heard what can only be described as something bounding towards the tent incredibly fast and stopping just short of it to our North. I recoiled and immediately shouted “WE HAVE A GUN, FUCK OFF”. Nothing. No response. No footsteps. No sound. We also didn't have a gun, I rarely carry one camping, but whoever was messing with us certainly didn't know that. I looked at Lynn who was now wide awake sitting up, her eyes were wide and pupils were dark saucers in the dark red glow from the headlamp. Something touched the tent from the North Side and pushed in slightly, the pressure almost creating the outline of a hand against the tent. Not a hand that I had ever seen before. We lost it. Lynn screamed. I screamed. And then proceeded to immediately go for the rain fly with knife in hand. At this point I didn't know what was out there. I was panicked and had just the control to think *get out of the tent, find ground to fight on, keep her safe.* Adrenaline surging, I tore out of the rain fly. I remember hearing what sounded like a gust of wind. Then nothing. There was nothing out there. I immediately toggled the headlamp into spotlight mode and started scanning around the campsite. Nothing. Then I noticed the rocks. All around the tent were rocks about the size of a football. They were not there before. *What the fuck is going on?* I thought. THUD. Right beside me. I jumped left and looked down at the rock that had just apparently fallen from the fucking sky. Naturally, I looked up. *Holy fuck*. Eyes. All I remember are the eyes and a hulking black outline. *What the fuck has red eyes!?* I thought to myself as I looked to Lynn and yelled “RUN”. She took off up the trail. I glanced back up to where I had seen the eyes while starting to backpedal. Nothing there. *Fuck this.* I ran too. This is where things got a bit blurry for me. The trail is steep so down is usually pretty easy. The trail up is not easy, at night even less so. I kept running. Because of the steepness of the trail and the switchbacks I could occasionally see Lynn's headlamp bobbing off the tops of the trees as she ran. I thought, just for a second, I saw shapes bounding through the tree tops. I hit the stream crossing in full stride and splashed through. I was absolutely certain something was on my heels but I wasn't going to turn around and look. I thought I heard rustling above me but it was drowned out by the pounding heartbeat in my ears. I made it to the last curve of the trail dripping in sweat to see a headlamp looking down. “Are you okay?” I shouted to Lynn. “Yes, what the fuck is going on?” she shouted back as she came towards me. “I don't know, we need to get out of here” I responded as we embraced and turned to the vehicle. We jogged together the last 25 yards to the vehicle and I reached in the pocket for the keys. *Oh no.* I thought as I realized I didn't have the keys. “I've got them” Lynn said as the car chirped. I breathed a sigh of relief as we hopped in and locked the doors. I immediately started the vehicle, kicked it into reverse and we drove to the nearest town Mortimer to collect ourselves.   
  
We discussed calling the authorities but what were we supposed to tell them? Something wanted to play catch with us in the woods at midnight? That a red eyed monster chased us away from our campsite? We would sound crazy. We do sound crazy. I'm still not even entirely sure what we saw. We drove home without returning to collect our things. Maybe I'll be able to go back one day and spend some time figuring out what transpired, but right now, I think Lynn and I will stick to the coast. If you're planning on going hiking or camping near Huntfish Falls in NC. Go somewhere else instead.
