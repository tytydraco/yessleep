I hate the snow. It never forgets. It doesn’t matter how fast we move, or how softly we step in it; the snow claims each step, drags it down, and presses it into the cold, unforgiving ground, leaving a perfect trail. A trail that can lead to nothing but misery and pain.

I’m not sure why I'm writing this. I’m not sure if it’s because my therapist thinks it’s a good way to calm my nerves. I’m not sure if it’s a way of telling myself it wasn’t my fault, and that there was nothing I could have done, or if it’s because I need to keep my mind off of the fact it’s winter again.

It was the summer of 2015. My childhood friend Avery’s grandpa had passed away, and in his will, he wrote that all of his possessions, including his old cabin, would be passed to his only child, Avery’s mother.

We both lived in Washington, and the cabin was located in Alaska, specifically Denali National Park. Avery’s family never had the time to travel up to Alaska to clean out her grandfather’s old cabin.
Eventually, it was time for our class to graduate. One last summer before we all went off to university. We decided to take a trip, but we couldn’t decide on where. I wanted to go to Florida, while my friend Spencer insisted on traveling to Los Angeles.
Through all of us arguing, one of Avery’s friends, Zoe, spoke up.

“Av, doesn’t your mom have a cabin in Alaska?”
“Yeah, we do. But it’s probably in terrible shape, and what is there to do up there?” Avery said, seemingly annoyed at the idea.

“Do you know how large it is? How many rooms?” I said, curious about it.

For some reason, Avery preferred not to talk about her grandfather. While that’s not unusual, it was to a concerning extent. Any mention shut her down, and she immediately tried to change the subject.
“It’s probably, I don’t know, 6-7 bedrooms? It’s been years since I’ve been there. I just remember it being… creepy. Dusty, cold, and boring.”

“Jesus,” Spencer said, speaking up. “Your grandpa had a goddamn mansion up there. We gotta go. I don’t care if it’s boring, we can play games or drink or something to pass the time.”

Spencer stood up, excited at the idea.
“I think it could be fun, Avery,” I said, looking at her. “Besides, your family hasn’t been up there, right? We can clean out your grandfather’s stuff. Who knows what crazy shit he had?”

“I guess it could be interesting. I’ll ask my mom about it tonight.” She said, not seeming too excited about the idea.

Not even three weeks later, our group was packing for a two-week stay in Denali. Our group consisted of myself, Avery, her friend Zoe, and my two friends William and Alexander. Alexander’s step-brother, Spencer, also ended up coming, as his vacation plans had fallen through, and he wanted to travel at least once this summer.

We boarded our flight to Fairbanks, Alaska from Seattle, and caught a bus heading towards Denali. We stopped at a visitor center near the base of Mount McKinley before making our way towards the cabin.

We eventually made it to Denali, where we ate at the bakery before checking in for the cabin. The man checking us in was short, with white hair and round glasses. He stood on a small stool behind the desk to make himself seem taller.

“Hello, I’m here to check in to cabin #301,” Avery said, as the man adjusted his glasses.

“Ahh, and I presume you’re Sarah?”
“I’m Sarah’s daughter, Avery. She gave me permission to use the cabin for a few weeks,” she said, handing over an ID as well as a slip of paper proving ownership.

“Ah, understood. Patrick was your grandfather, eh?”
“Yep,” Avery replied.

“I’m sorry for your loss. Damn shame that he passed. He was one of the nicest guys around here, and one of the few I’d consider a friend. Did y’know he built his own cabin? Wanted it higher up the mountain and deeper in its forests. Not sure why. I thought it was for hunting, but it seems like he was interested in something else. Maybe he enjoyed the solace and isolation. Some people find it comforting.”

Eventually, we got the keys and began to hike towards a lift the old man had mentioned, taking us further up the mountain.

After what felt like a few hours of hiking, we found it. A singular path leading to the cabin, surrounded by nothing but snow and dead trees. It was expertly crafted, with impressive carvings, and seemed to be nearly three stories tall.

“Welp, my balls may be frozen solid, but we’re here,” Alex said, annoyed. “Unlock this door already, it’s too cold to gawk at some stupid old building.”

“Stop being so negative.” Spencer said, placing his hand on Alex’s shoulder.

Avery unlocked the door, and the second it swung open, a thick wall of dust hit us. We coughed and waved our hands through the air. Once it settled, the place was beautiful. A little rough around the edges, sure, but with a good cleaning, it could be a really nice place to stay.

The living room was huge, with an old box TV sitting in the corner. A stone fireplace stood tall, its soot-streaked bricks showing years of use. If we could find some dry wood, it would easily keep us warm. Decorations were scattered around — old photos, wooden carvings, and strange trinkets that gave the place a strange charm.

“This place is incredible. Did he actually live here? Or was this a vacation-getaway situation?” Zoe asked, spinning slowly to take it all in.

“Lived here,” Avery replied, brushing dust from a wooden shelf. “My grandfather sold his house in Oregon and bought this place. Spent the last 20 years of his life up here. He barely ever came down to Washington.”

“We should get the power on. Is there a basement or something?” I asked, flicking a light switch. 

Nothing. The room stayed dim, the last bits of daylight struggling through the dirt-streaked windows.

“Yeah, here’s the door!” William called, pulling open a small door that led to a narrow staircase. He and Avery disappeared down into the darkness.

A few minutes later, the hum of electricity filled the air. The old lights flickered to life, casting a warm yellow glow over the cabin. Every lamp, clock, and appliance powered on at once, and for a second, the buzzing noise made us all jump.

I walked over to the TV and pressed the power button. Static was displayed across the screen, the dull sound filling the room. It looked ancient, but surprisingly, it still worked. I flipped through the channels, hoping to catch a signal. Nothing but more static.

I kept trying, and then — something.

A faint image broke through the fuzz. It was an old black-and-white sitcom. The scene showed a family in a living room, the parents arguing over their son’s game. The laugh track kicked in at random, almost like it wasn’t meant to be there. It was boring, but I let it play in the background while I scrolled through my phone.

Then, something changed.
When I glanced back at the screen, the faces of the parents looked… wrong. Blurry. Like they were melting and reforming all at once, never settling on a single expression. My chest tightened. I rubbed my eyes, thinking it was just the dust messing with me.
But the longer I watched, the worse it got. The faces twisted, unrecognizable. Shifting. And then came the nausea.

The wave of sickness hit me hard. My head pounded, and my stomach churned. It felt like the floor was tilting beneath me. My knees buckled, and I gripped the arm of the couch to steady myself. It didn’t help. The pounding in my skull grew worse, and a deep, twisting nausea settled in my stomach.
My vision blurred at the edges. Every instinct screamed at me to look away, but I couldn’t.

The couple on the screen — the husband and wife — weren’t moving. They just stood there, side by side, staring. Not at each other. At me. Their eyes, or what should’ve been their eyes, were nothing but shifting voids, like puddles of murky water.

Their faces never stopped twisting. A nose would sharpen, then collapse into itself. A mouth curled into a grin that vanished a second later. It was as if the TV was trying to decide what they should look like and failing over and over.

I gagged, the sickness growing stronger, causing me to  stumble back.
“What the hell are you doing?” Alex said as he walked towards me, but I couldn’t register him. My hands trembled as I pointed at the TV.
“Dude, I feel like death himself,” I croaked, clutching my stomach.

Alex frowned, holding a lighter near the fireplace.
“It’s probably dust. That stuff can mess you up badly. Make you feel sick.”
He flicked the lighter, and the flame danced to life, the fire crackling and casting warmth across the room.

And then, just like that — it was gone.
The sickness. The pounding in my head. The twisting nausea. It was like a weight had been lifted from my body. Even the TV was back to normal, the screen buzzing with static. No distorted faces. No empty eyes. Just white noise.

“What… the hell? I feel fine,” I said, though my legs still shook.

Alex grinned, clearly amused.
“Hey, this is a good show! Glad to see you’re enjoying it!” He pointed at the static, mocking me.
“Dude, there was something on the TV. And then I—”

“Yeah, there is something. Static.” He rolled his eyes. “Stop bugging out, man. Help us get the rooms ready. Sun’s setting.”

He jerked his head toward the window, where the sky was already dimming.

I wanted to argue, to explain what I’d seen — but what could I even say? The words wouldn’t come. Instead, I swallowed hard, gave one last glance at the flickering screen, and followed Alex.

But even as I stepped away, I swore I could still feel those empty eyes on me. Watching. I knew something wasn’t right, but I was tired and decided to head upstairs to prepare for bed.

But as the first night drew to a close, I wished we had left. I wish I had screamed about the TV and dragged everyone out. I wish we had fled — because something had stirred, and now it knew we were here.
