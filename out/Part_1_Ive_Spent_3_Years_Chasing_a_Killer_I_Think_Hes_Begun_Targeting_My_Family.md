I’ve never posted on here before, but I don’t know where else to go. I’m a detective, and for the past 3 years, my department and I have been chasing a ghost, a monster — and now I think he’s coming for my family. 

I don’t have concrete proof yet, I'm not sure if it’s him… But If something happens to me, or to them, I need someone to know it wasn’t random. It was him.

Three years ago, the town of Silver Creek was terrorized by a serial killer. It began when a girl named Kristine went missing. She was out with some friends at a local concert, but unfortunately never came home. 

Her parents filed a missing persons report, and despite numerous searches and interrogations, nothing came of it. About 2 weeks after she had gone missing, a hiker had found a mangled body in the woods. After extensive DNA testing, it was revealed to be Kristine.

Theories began to fly, from people saying she had fallen off the trail, to people saying she had been attacked by a wild animal, nobody was sure. Just months after Kristine was found, police were called to investigate a case of home invasion. 

When they arrived, they found Cathy missing, and her parents dead. That’s when the city realized what was happening: A killer was on the loose. I originally was assigned to the case of Cathy’s parents, to figure out what had happened. 

The crime scene was one I will never forget. Cathy’s mother had died of blunt force trauma, and the father had been cleaved with what we assumed to be an axe.

Despite searching the scene, we found no prints. The back door was open, the killer probably slipped in when nobody was looking. After talking to the neighbors, they said they had heard screaming, but saw nothing.

For the next year, we tried our best to find the killer as he got bolder. A couple had been hacked, a car was found crashed with a bloody trail leading to a man’s body, and a group of teenagers camping were all found dead, with a few of the bodies having been dumped in a lake. 

We spent so much goddamn time trying to find the monster, but he was always gone by the time a call was made.

Some people around the office began to say he was a ghost. No evidence, seemingly able to travel great distances fast, and almost invisible. As panic began to rise, our mayor held a press conference giving a name to the monster: The Silver Creek Slasher.

Headlines ran wild with the name, plastering it everywhere, which only instilled more fear in the town. They didn’t care though, it had people talking, and that’s what pays. 

After the carnage the monster had made, we finally had a break. Another missing person, Leanne, was spotted on the side of the road a few days after she had been reported missing. A trucker had seen her, visibly shaken and injured, as well as looking thin. 

According to the driver, she was emotionally distraught, sobbing and begging the driver to take her to the police, as she kept looking outside fearfully.

After she had calmed down and was safe, me and my partner, Damon, went to talk to her. She had said that a tall man had put a rag with what I guess was chloroform over her mouth, causing her to faint. 

When she woke up, she was in a small padded room, restrained to a chair. After a few days, she had been able to undo the restraints, and ran into the woods. 

She said for a few days, she hadn’t seen or heard anything. When asked to tell us the location she had escaped from, she mentioned an abandoned shipping container in the woods.

When officers arrived, they found a rusty old shipping container. When they opened it, they found what we had dubbed ‘The Toybox’ — a padded room with a chair for restraining people, and an assortment of surgical tools and weapons. The room was covered in dried blood, presumably from the other victims.

With the killer’s hideout found, it was only a matter of time before we caught the bastard. But when the news made the headline, the killer vanished. And for the next 2 years, nothing happened. No home invasions, no kidnappings, no murders, nothing.

Even though the killer had stopped, the town never rested. He was a stain on Silver Creek, and even 2 years later, going over the evidence, it’s unbelievable how he got away. There was nothing to give even a hint to his identity. It was bizarre.

But, as you can probably guess, something has changed recently. Yesterday I was asleep when I woke up from my cell phone ringing. When I answered, I heard Damon’s voice. 

“Jasper, you need to get down here.” 

“What happened, Damon? Did your car break down agai-" 

“A body was found. They think he struck again.” Damon interrupted, his voice stern. 

“You’re shitting. I’m on my way. Tell the chief I'll be there in 10.” I said, throwing on my jacket and hopping in my car.

As I floored it through the dark streets, gliding past the pine trees and rain-soaked hills of Silver Creek in the spring, all I could think about was the fact that he was back. He couldn’t be, right? A copycat, or a freak accident, or just another unrelated homicide. But, it wouldn’t surprise me.

I sometimes wonder if I'm cursed. Everything good that happens is followed by something terrible, that keeps piling on until I'm at my limit once again. 

Last summer, my wife passed away from a stroke. Our children were devastated, my oldest, Lucas, couldn’t attend any events for a while. He had cut off everyone, missed days of school, and fell into a depression. 

My youngest daughter, Stephanie, was just turning 12, and was also devastated, to the point where she was seeing a children’s therapist, one who she still visits today.

Lucas has somewhat healed. Although her memory still brings pain, the surface level wounds have healed. Why am I telling you this? Maybe to vent, or maybe to give a better understanding of my mental state. Even as I write this, I think about her.

When I got to the station, I read the report. The victim was a male, about 32, and had a major gash in the head, and was dumped on the side of the highway. 

The man was identified as Mr. Perlman, and the culprit was once again unknown. “So, what makes you think it’s him?” The Chief said.

“Most of his victims had been struck in the head with an axe. Seemed to be his weapon of choice. Either this is a copycat, or the Silver Creek Slasher is back in business.” Damon said.

“Don’t even say that shit” I said, picking up a folder and sitting at my desk. 

“Are there photos of the scene?” I said, logging in to my computer so I could begin writing a case report.

I didn’t get home until around 3pm the next day. It was miserable, I felt like shit, and after being souped up on coffee and five-hour energy, I was ready to crash. 

When I got inside, a few minutes later the bus dropped off Stephanie, and Lucas pulled his car into the drive a bit later.

I ended up falling asleep, and told the kids to order something for dinner, as I'll eat when I wake up. A while later, I woke up. 

The clock read 8:30 pm, and I got out of bed to go downstairs. After finding something to eat, I crashed again. Morning came, and when I came downstairs, I saw my daughter, Stephanie, pissed off.

“Hey Steph, everything alright?” I said.

 “Look at this dad!” Stephanie said, gesturing me outside. When I stepped out, I saw something strange. On our porch laid Stephanie’s bike. 

But it was destroyed. The paint had been scraped off, the tires slashed, and the handle broken. 

“What in the..?” I looked up, and noticed my car had been scraped too. 

“Hey, what the hell?” I said, running over to my car.

As I grabbed the door, it was unlocked. This struck me as odd, as I know I had locked it when I got home yesterday. Inside, everything was trashed, my radio had been cut, papers everywhere, and a marker on my window spelled out ‘Father Of The Year’ in large, red letters.

My son’s car had been vandalized too. The words ‘Missed A Spot’ were scribbled on his windows. 

“What the hell could that mean?” I said. After going back inside, I questioned Lucas to see if the phrase meant anything to him, or if his friends had played a prank on us.

“What kind of friend would do that? They’re not morons, dad.” 

“Kids these days have sick ideas of what’s funny. Any classmates you know that are troublemakers?” I said. 

“How about instead of people I know, look into people you know. Maybe someone you locked up got angry and decided to screw with you.” Lucas remarked.

“Besides, doesn’t that old lady across the street have cameras?” Lucas said. I stopped, realizing that he’s right. 

“I can’t stand her, she’s so rude, even by old lady standards.” I said, getting up and heading towards the door. 

“Get your stuff ready, the bus will be here soon.”

“Dad, it’s Saturday.” Stephanie said.

 “Is it? Shit, my bad.” I said, turning around and heading across the street. After talking to Beth, and helping her use her smartphone, we were able to pull up the video from last night.

At 2:43 AM, the cameras picked up a silhouette slipping from the treeline. It moved slowly, almost alien, pausing to scan the yard before locking onto the front door. 

The figure just stood there… motionless, staring, for what felt like forever. Then it crept toward the window, its face just out of view, peering into the living room.

A minute later, it vanished around the back of the house. I balled my fist, waiting, my pulse pounding. When it returned, it didn’t hesitate — painting the car windows, kicking over my daughter’s bike, tearing into anything it could reach. 

Then, just like that, it turned and vanished into the woods, as quickly as it had come.

“What the hell? What’s going on?” The old lady said, looking at me. 

“We had someone vandalize my shit. I’m letting the force know. Any way you can send the footage to me?” I said, standing up.

“I think I know how to. Just make sure they don’t get my car as well.” Beth said, in an almost snarky tone.

 “He won’t,” I said, annoyed.

I just emailed the report to my chief, as well as Damon, and I'm currently waiting on a response. I could head to the station, but I want to stay home. I’m not a deeply religious person, but I prayed that it was just a kid playing a prank. 

But with another person dead, and how strangely the figure moved, it’s too much of a coincidence. I think the Silver Creek Slasher is back, and he has begun targeting my family.
