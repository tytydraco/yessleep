There’s a road in my country that spans for 3 states. It is the only road that can be used to cross these states (actually there’s another option but it takes quite longer) and it has a section of 150km that has absolutely nothing. There are no gas stations, no cellphone reception, no houses, no road support. Nothing.

I’ve traveled this road many times and at least half of them during the night. After about 20h the road is mostly empty and because there are no road lights, traveling there at night all you can see is what the headlights of your car can illuminate.

I’ve grown used to it. I’m a car dealer and a small one, so I often buy cars very far to get low prices and sell in my state for a profit. That’s how I make a living, so I’m ok with that.

Last time I bought a car in that state I was unlucky enough that the bus was late, the salesman who deals the used cars was late and in the end I was tired and hungry and home sick at around 20h. So I gathered my things, hopped on the car and went on to grab something to eat before starting my trip.

After grabbing a McDonald’s, my hunger was dealt with at the expense of some of my health and I got to the road. As usual I texted my wife and told her I’d be home in about 10-12h. 

We chatted (sorry, I do text and drive, you can judge me I understand. If I just drive I may get sleepy. I swear I’m careful) the first hours about random stuff, including texting and driving, and in a few hours I was at the last gas station before that section of the road.

At that point I filled the tank and called my wife. 

“Honey, I’m entering horror movie road, I’ll be away a while as always, and it’s late, go to bed and I’ll see you when I get home” I said. We had nicknamed the road, like a couple of teens.

“Okay, don’t play games on your phone just because you have no reception. Listen to some music and drive safe ok?”

“No promises, but I’ll try. It’s already almost 2AM and I’m dead tired… sweet dreams honey”

“If you are tired stop and sleep” she said a bit angrily. I understood, she just wanted me to be safe.

“Okay baby”.

I resumed my drive, snacks on the passenger seat, music on the radio and my face dripping from a splash on the sink to get me awake. Monster energy drink gobbled down and I was off.

The road was calm and empty and the very few cars behind me didn’t follow me to horror movie road and there I was alone in the dark. The road not only is dark but also full of potholes, no side emergency lanes. No lanes painted too mostly. So, I was left with my thoughts, my music and my snacks.

I drove for about 50km, with no issues, nothing of note. I think I might have crossed with 2 or 3 cars the entire time. I was listening to a song by dream theater when my dashboard lights blinked randomly a few times. I looked at the dashboard and found that I was almost out of gas. That was impossible, I had just filled the tank!

“Crap, I must have a leak, this is impossible”. Also, what the fuck? Why did my dashboard lights blink?

Two seconds later, the car stopped and the battery light was blinking and beeping like crazy. “Those guys from the dealership could really not be trusted. They told me the car was fine” I thought. I didn’t want to risk also running out of battery so I put the car on neutral and let it slide back off the road and turned it off.

Outside it was pitch black. If you sprayed black paint on all the windows, there would be no difference at all. There was no moon or stars in the sky, obscured by clouds I assumed. I paused for a while to think but I found out I couldn’t. Besides the pitch black darkness outside, the heat inside rose quickly and I had to open the window a bit only to find that outside there was complete silence.

I couldn’t hear a single cricket, the wind, leaves moving, nothing. Absolute, complete and total silence. It’s actually deafening when you can hear absolutely nothing. It’s like being inside a pool and feeling the pressure in your eardrums but you can’t even hear splashes.

I stood there trying to think about what to do but my thoughts were clouded by the darkness and silence.

At that point I was there for about 15 minutes sitting in darkness and silence and I could barely see the inside of the car. When the car stopped I had just taken a left turn and there was a farm gate about 200m ahead I had seen when the car was still on. Other than that, this entire road is enclosed by pine trees on both sides.

Nothing came and went while I was there and I could barely think of options. I could check the car in the pool of black ink around me and hell if I was doing that. I was scared, I admit, and even if I found the problem I wouldn’t be able to solve it. Save for a battery issue if it was somewhat disconnected, but well, if I had no gas, no reason to mess with the battery right? Right. I could wait for another car to pass or sleep through the night and walk and find help in the morning. Those options made me feel a BIT safer. So that was my plan.

But I was definitely wrong about feeling safe.

A few minutes went by and I was playing bejeweled on my phone to pass some time. I often use my phone completely muted but this time the sounds of gems shattering were kind of relaxing.

I was there considering some moves when I started hearing a buzz from outside raising in volume. I thought for an instant I was going deaf when it became very loud and, with a pressure that had shaken the car, a very strong gust of wind came and instants later heavy rain started pouring down. The deafening silence was now replaced by the deafening sound of large raindrops falling on top of the car. 

A thunderstorm followed suit and when thunder stroke on the horizon I could see some the treetops around. Dark silhouettes of pine tree tops in a hazy dark blue sky.

I tried to assess the road in front of me after every strike — like a mad man — but there was honestly nothing really to be seen. After a few minutes the clouds stopped fighting among themselves and only the rain was left. I was again left with no vision outside of the car.

After another few minutes, while I was still examining the outside, I saw two faint white lights coming towards me in the distance. But they were approaching too slowly to be another car.

—

The white pale lights coming towards me were slow and I was sure they were coming in walking speed. If I wasn’t already uneasy, the dots coming my way made me feel in danger.

I stared at them coming for what felt like an eternity (but were actually about 30 seconds) until they turned to the side and disappeared from view.

“How do I get the hell away from here?” - I thought in anguish. I decided to text my wife. If by a miracle I got some signal, and by another, after being sleeping for hours with her sleeping pills, she picked up the phone, she might get someone here to help me. I also tried dialing emergency services but there was no line.

As my phone battery also started running low I decided to turn the car key halfway to get some juice from the dying battery. 

I looked at the dashboard to see the situation and plug my phone, and instinctively I turned off the headlights as soon as I noticed they were still on, but my peripheral vision caught a glimpse of something crossing the road. 

My brain thought for a moment it was a person, and in mere moments, I turned the light on again, saw it, and flicked the back lights off with my heart racing.

“It” was a two legged creature, with joints that resembles those of a dog, a hunched and arched erect body, two arms and a bald oval head. That’s what I could gather from that look. And it turned towards me as I had flashed the lights at it.

In fear, I locked the car doors and dropped the seat to get out of sight of whatever this was. I saw the white dots again looking at the car, standing there. His eyes were looking towards me but they were still.

The inside of the car was totally dark. I needed to remind myself to breathe as I tried not to make a sound. Not that it would matter with all the rain falling anyway.

The thing made some animalistic gutural sound. Could it be an animal? But it almost looked human. An altered version, a DNA mishap?

Then I heard its steps splashing water puddles towards me and fear started to build again. There’s nowhere to hide inside a car.

It stopped close to the hood and I could see it examining it with curiosity, because its white eyes glowed so bright, it illuminated its face. That definitely resembled a human head. It was humming, while observing the hood of the car. It didn’t notice me inside.

“It’s just an animal. It’s curious. It all will be over soon, it’s going to check the car and leave. It’s all ok” I tried to tell myself to calm my nerves. And for a while I was right.

But then, out of freaking nowhere, the car darted back to life, like it had suddenly found the battery under the hood and wanted to resume the trip. Dream Theater started blowing up on the speakers and the radio, dashboard and convenience lights inside turned on. 

“Okay, I’m dead” was my next thought. In the split second I looked at the dashboard I lost track of the creature. It was behind the car and I looked again and it wasn’t there. Maybe the music scared it?

After the moment I looked back, I looked forward again and felt uneasy. In my peripheral vision, I knew it was looking right at me with the face very close to the drivers window.

I froze looking straight ahead. I was sweating as cold as ice and repenting from my sins. I’m dead. The thing started trying to open the car door, pulling very intelligently the handle. I couldn’t move my head, but it was there, face almost touching the window. Clack clack clack, pulling the door handle. 

And thank God I didn’t look at it. There on my dashboard I found out my car had also found all the missing fuel. I was close to full. I turned the key. Vroom, the engine purred like it had never let me down ages ago.

I took a last glance at that thing, its irrational looking animal-human like face, pale and scaly, angry for not reaching its prey with all its serrated teeth out growled like the engine sound was another animal growling back in anger.

I floored the accelerator and felt the creature sliding by my door, being left behind. It raised its arms in anger growling in my rear view mirror as I extracted every horsepower from the engine.

About 3km later I saw a truck. Asshole. Where were you 5 minutes ago to help me?

— 

About an hour later, with my heart still racing and my mind trying to understand what I had just been through I left the horror movie road only to be startled again. Ding! “Fuck!” It was just my phone still with sound, sending my heart rate to 200bpm again.

“Is this some kind of joke? Where are you? Are you serious?” - my wife replied to “baby the car stopped on the horror movie road, I think I’m in danger, need help”. The text had arrived seconds before and she woke up. I had to call and explain to my very skeptic wife what happened and that I was ok. 

She still wouldn’t believe when I arrived and met her inside home. She still thinks I had just slept and had a nightmare. But I knew that there were no dents in the left side doors when I got the car. That creature owed me repairs for two doors. And hell if I ever drive that road again.
