My name is Liz, I’m 22 years old, and I’m married now. I should mention, I’m also on medication. When I was around 17, I went through something that was diagnosed as a hallucination caused by anxious stress linked to a bipolar condition. **But now I know it was real.**

I was finishing high school and at the peak of my teenage years, wanting to have fun and meet new people. Like any teenager, I spent a considerable amount of time on social media. However, something made me cut back on that excessive usage after 8 pm.

There I was, in my room with pink walls and photos stuck to the wall opposite me, sitting on my bed with my back against the wall and my laptop resting on my thighs. Its screen cast just enough light to let me see the keyboard and a bit of my face. I was on Discord, chatting with a group of friends. It was late, and I didn’t want to risk waking my parents, so instead of talking, I was typing. 

While I was finishing a message, I thought I heard something, so I turned down the volume on my headphones. Nothing. I didn’t hear anything. I turned the volume back up, and that’s when a thought popped into my head: *Is someone here?* I can’t say exactly what made me think that, but for some reason, the thought latched onto my mind. And no matter how funny the Discord chat was, I couldn’t stop thinking: *Is someone there?* Realizing how irrational I was being, I tried to ignore the thought, convincing myself that all the doors in the house were locked, same with the windows. And if there was even the slightest chance someone was here, I would’ve seen them walk past my door, which had been closed since I entered the room.

*So they came in before me.*  
No, that’s ridiculous, ghosts don’t exist. And even if they did, I’d send them straight to hell.  
*So it’s not spirits, then.*  
Shut up, Liz. Just shut the damn hell up. There is absolutely no way someone else is in this room.

*- ok guys, I think it’s getting late, I’m gonna sleep now. xoxo* \- I shut down the computer and went to sleep. I fell asleep surprisingly fast, and the next day, I followed my usual teenage routine: wake up, go to school, come back home, and do my homework.

And then, just before lying down, I went through my usual bedtime routine. I turned off the lights and got comfortable in bed. I opened my laptop, plugged in my headphones, put on some music on Spotify, and started chatting with a friend on Discord. Let’s call him John. John went to the same school as me, but he was older and he was *so* cute! I’d lost count of how many times I thought about asking him out during our chats.

That’s when I heard my bedroom door closing slowly and gently, like when my mom comes in to say goodnight and quietly leaves. I took off my headphones. I could’ve sworn I heard my bedroom door shutting. But I didn’t see it move. And of course, that wouldn’t even be possible because it was already closed. I had closed it myself before getting into bed.

*It must’ve been my parents going to the bathroom*, I thought, a desperate attempt to ease the growing terror building in my chest.  
*Is someone here? I think there is*.  
Stop thinking about that again, Liz. That’s nonsense.

A cold, damp breeze brushed the back of my neck, making my hair move.

Are the doors locked?  
Of course they are. My dad checks them every night.  
But… maybe it’s a good idea for me to double-check. Just in case.

I get out of bed and walk into the dark hallway, using my phone’s flashlight to light the way. The deafening silence makes the furniture creak and the appliances hum, or was it the floorboards groaning under someone’s footsteps, and flies buzzing around something rotting?

**The living room door is locked.**

I head back down the hallway, now toward the kitchen door. I pass by my parents’ room and consider knocking, just to say I had a nightmare.  
*Oh, for God’s sake. Are you seven? Get a grip*.

**The kitchen door is locked.**

I turn around, and a loud creak makes me jump - *it’s the fridge* \- I hold the phone in front of me, lighting the way back to my room. But before I can even step out of the kitchen, a dark head, low to the ground, quickly pulls back behind the refrigerator.

*It’s nothing, it’s nothing, it’s nothing*, I repeat in my head, trying to suppress the tingling rising from my feet to my thighs, as my throat tightens and my face begins to burn.

*They know. They know you saw them.*

**I need to tell John.**

I go back to my room, close the door behind me, and grab my still-open laptop from the bed.  
*-* john, I don’t know if I’m going crazy or if I really saw something in my kitchen watching me… - I delete the message before sending it.  
***They can’t know I know about them.***  
Did they have time to read it before I erased it?  
**I can’t take the risk.**  
*Don’t think too much tey’ll know*. Just go to sleep and pretend you didn’t see anything. Maybe you’ll fool them.

 *- good night john, see you tomorrow. I’m exhausted.*  
I send the message and go to sleep.

**The entire next day, I could feel them.**

At breakfast, I felt them watching me through the crack in the window.  
On the way to school, I heard them walking through the tall grass.  
When I got home, I saw them darting out of the kitchen as I opened the front door.  
By sunset, their number had grown so many that they began to feel like a single, massive presence.

That night, I laughed out loud while on a call with my friends. I put on some music and danced alone in my room. I took a shower to the sound of Katy Perry and got into bed early.  
I tucked myself in calmly and let out a sleepy, content sigh as I heard them shifting, squeezing themselves under my bed trying to hold their breath.

That year, I was diagnosed with bipolar personality disorder, and I started therapy and taking prescription medication. I even told some people about that episode and laughed about how crazy our minds can be. I never had another experience like that again, **until now.**

My husband works at a hospital and has to sleep there every three days. Last night was one of those nights.

I woke up early, did the laundry, made dinner, cleaned the house, and went to take a long shower just like any other day. I lit a scented candle and turned on the warm bathroom lights. The hot water fell onto my head and ran down my face when I suddenly heard a slow creaking door.

*Someone’s breaking into my house.*

I grabbed my phone and typed *911*, keeping it ready in case I needed to call. I turned off the shower and grabbed a towel.

*I locked the doors, how could anyone get in?*

I wrapped myself in the towel and walked to the kitchen. I picked up a knife and started walking slowly toward the front door.

**The door is locked.**

*I must’ve imagined it.*  
*Are you sure about that?*

I hear the floor creak coming from my bedroom. I run there and turn on the lights.  
**Nothing**.

I get dressed and slowly kneel in front of the bed, positioning the knife carefully in front of me.  
**There’s nothing under the bed**.

*I need to talk to my psychiatrist. I probably need to adjust my med***s.**  
*Are you sure about that, Liz?* ***We missed you so much.***

**What the hell is this?**  
Stop being stupid. Don’t feed into this paranoia.

*Why are you so upset, Liz?*  
My thoughts are moving so fast I can’t even organize them anymore.

I can feel their presence coming from the hallway outside my bedroom, right behind me now. I can’t move both from fear and strategy. Maybe I should pretend I don’t sense them**.** I grab my phone, delete the police number, and open Spotify. I play some white noise and lie down in bed. I cover myself while giving a slight, tired smile, **even though it’s fake**. I force myself to sleep despite feeling them lie down next to me, sinking the mattress. I turn and look, pretending I’m not searching for them, but I don’t see anything, absolutely nothing, but I know they’re here.

*But you know we’re here.*

I close my eyes and try to sleep.

It’s 8 a.m. now, and my husband just got home. He asked me why I left the front door unlocked**.** I don’t mind that you’re reading this after all, you already knew I was pretending yesterday, right? I don’t know what they want, just please don’t hurt my husband.

# Now, to those of you reading this on Reddit, here’s a warning:

**Listen to your intuition. That chill you get when you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night isn’t always false. Maybe they’re with you too.**
