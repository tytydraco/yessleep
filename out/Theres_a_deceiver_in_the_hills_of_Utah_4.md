Hello, all. To any who harbour growing concern, ease your hearts. I will not lie and say that I now feel safe, for I don’t believe this to be true. But I am not in any direct danger, I do not see the harm or mutilation I’ve seen here to await me.

I plan to leave tomorrow. Just being in this place is having an effect on me, one which I no longer desire to experience.

But, I fear that I will leave here alone. Fear, no… perhaps that isn’t the right word. Maybe the word for this feeling hasn’t yet been conceived of. In any case, I don’t like it. I don’t like it here.

.

Annie and I managed to get some sleep. In fact, the beds provided were quite comfortable, with linen spreads and woollen pillows to rest our heads.

Yet, I was awoken by something during the early hours. My eyes flickered open, but there was nothing noticeable at first that could have caused this. I had no need to use a restroom, nor was I thirsty. I searched for what could have possibly roused me for a while, until I realised what had been there since I’d re-emerged from sleep.

A low harmony of uncountable tones sang out from somewhere. I felt in particular that it came from somewhere above us, but with how the frequencies merged and separated, interwove then unwound, made it difficult to pinpoint.

I had no worry, not at first.

But the longer I listened, the more my mind became in-tune with the soothing vibrations, the less I found my ability to think clearly. My train of thought was constantly derailed, or switched lanes, without my conscious choice. The thoughts, musings, they became disordered, and often felt as if they were not my own.

It was when I began to make out… voices, for lack of a better term. Not those you would hear spoken, travelling as molecular vibrations in the air. They were better described as how one might “hear” their internal monologue.

Only, the words and ideas conveyed were foreign, unfamiliar. They were not mine. I can’t recall anything distinct with how they overlapped, becoming one and then separate again in an endless chain of order struggling against entropy.

I suddenly considered the notion that if I listened for too long, they would replace my own internal self entirely. That idea terrified me more than anything had before, and I was quick to dive back under the covers, and fold the pillow tightly around my head.

The relentless cognitive noise settled, and I found sleep again.

I was disturbed once again, this time with faint orange rays pouring in through the gaps between pillars. Unlike before, I immediately registered that a sound had woken me, and I shot up into a sitting position to see that Annie had done the same.

Standing at the door, holding it open, was Domimokah.

“I hope you have found rest this night. I have brought some things to refresh the both of you, that I feel you will enjoy.”

He carried with him a large wooden tray, which held two steaming earthenware cups, and an assortment of fresh foods. I shot Annie an inquisitive glance, and her returned expression agreed the sentiment.

Excuse my French, but the food was *fucking delicious*. I don’t think I’ve ever had a more fulfilling breakfast in my life, and even now I strive to be able to cook a morning meal that could even begin to rival it.

The cups held some kind of herbal tea, which invigorated my body and cured any lingering tiredness from my interrupted sleep. We ate cheeses, bread, fruits and vegetables, the likes of which had never blessed my tongue with such wonders.

My only complaint is that it was *too* good, and we were finished without taking the time to savour it. Domimokah seemed pleased with our reception, and waited patiently until we were ready to walk with him. The breakfast, fit for a lord, did not dispel the memories of what we had experienced yesterday, though, and I made an effort to bear that in mind.

As we walked down a long, straight hallway, I gave Annie the liberty of asking the questions this time, though she definitely bordered on interrogation at some points. I chose to remain silent, in part because of the residual horror of yesterday’s events.

“The monks here, the ones who sit still for as long as you have described; how are they alive, if their brains are gone?”

“As I have said, they become receptacles, in which the great Well of Thought may reside, in some capacity. Their minds are not here, but there – as droplets of oil in an ocean, so that they are preserved as individuals.”

All the while, Annie was writing all this down on her notepad, as was I. Having two versions to compare is infinitely better than one, in my eyes at least. She continued with pre-planned questions, instead of delving further into the answers she received.

“This Well you talk about so often, what are you referring to? The huge skull you showed us yesterday?”

“The great Well of Thought, my friend. Would you lend your ear to me, allow me to enlighten you on why this place came to be?”

“Of course,” Annie replied, instantly.

Domimokah was silent for a time, seeming to ponder how to start the tale he was about to tell us. His head tilted back, eyes closed, before he returned to composure, and spoke,

“Before us, there were nine beings who walked the Earth as one of its innate properties. Of these beings, they shared but one mind, a vast sea in which their ideas, thoughts and concepts came to fruition, and so would these manifest in the physical realm as they desired.

“However, despite the limitless potential for creation, they felt a hollow, deep inside. What good were they as one perfect collective, with nothing else to witness them?

“With much pondering, they conceived of free will; so they might create an independent being, but one with access to their great mind, in which they could think, ponder, and muse. As the source of the beings' creations, the mind was something they could not replicate, and so their only choice was to share a portion of their own.”

Annie seemed entranced by his telling, and had stopped writing. I kept on with it, though, as her backup.

“But what good is a single living being with no companions, no way to pass on their ideas, and their memories? The beings considered this as well, and begot living creatures able to propagate through time. The mechanisms would vary, but most were successful. And with each new generation came a variation in their being; slight changes which morphed and shaped their forms over the ages. The wonder of evolution.

“At first, in the expansive oceans, they spawned primordial, marine life. They observed, seldom interfering, watching as life began to vary, expand, change. For these beings, the wait for the first of the creatures to crawl onto the shore was but a fleeting moment, and soon, the creatures had evolved to be far more complex, acting off their own volition.

“This went on, and here we are. Humanity. Mankind bred, had families, expanded, and built their settlements. Again, for living things to think for themselves, the beings had to share their Well of Thought. So, as the nine watched from out of view, seeing the good, the evil, and all in between emerge from the minds of humanity, it began to take a toll on them.

“Their great mind became tainted, imprinted with the ideas, thoughts, and memories of all humankind, as they advanced further than could have been imagined. Aeons passed, and one by one, the nine beings began to perish in body. They travelled to remote and quiet places before their deaths. While only bones remain, they live on, inside the Well of Thought.”

Though I transcribed his words, I doubted each and every one. How many men had proclaimed their dogmatic truths, all claiming to speak the words of a deity, taking themselves for prophets? Such is our single-mindedness.

“For the beings, inventing life, free to act on its own, was their greatest mistake. For, while they hold unimaginable power even now, they are not all-powerful, and their sea of thoughts, while unfathomably vast, is not infinite, and each day it continues to be tainted, broken down, purely through the mere action of thinking.

“So, the fate of humanity has come to be that one day, they will have run dry the great Well, and it will cease to exist, leaving all living things as beings of perception, nothing more. Egos will fade into nothingness, individuality forgotten. No more will be born new memories, nor thoughts, nor ideas, nor concepts; all that have existed throughout history will vanish, leaving humanity to roam aimlessly as mindless beings, acting purely out of instinct. We would hear, see, smell, and feel all, but comprehend or remember naught.”

Admittedly, I was impressed with the tale. Yet again, mankind would condemn itself to eternal torment, as is proclaimed in so many faiths. Perhaps there as an inherent loathing for those of our kind as we walk amongst them – we sure love weaving narratives about apocalypse and armageddon.

Something was missing though. What exactly had Domimokah, Yerhemmi, and the others devoted themselves for? What good was worship in the face of the inevitable? So, that I asked,

“What’s the point of all this, then? Your faith, and how you insist on it? Why, if we’re all damned anyway?”

“Well,” he replied, seeming to already know I would ask this, “it is a fate that is concrete no longer. Our founder encountered one of the nine in these hills, the skull of whom you have already witnessed, acting as a gateway of communication to the rest above, in the Well of Thought.

“I understand our practice may seem rather... brutal, but rest assured that those who commune, are not in pain, or even discomfort - after the initial rite, at least, but that is a passing agony. Their minds are offered to the great Well, and they remain in communion for as long as needed. When the pure white flames spout from their empty skulls, that is when they are truly ready to enter unity, and so they are offered. There they remain alongside the nine, quietly assisting as angels of humanity.

“When the time comes, we will wipe clean the slate; purge the sea of all thought, and start anew. The angels will guide humanity in rebuilding their societies, ideas, and connections, and I would hope that when the need arises once more in the distant future, our descendants will follow in our steps. I cannot say when this will happen, but the Well runs dry, and it may come sooner than we believed.

Even holding my scepticism, I couldn’t help but shudder at the notion. To reduce every person to a mindless animal, then rebuild from the ground up. Every last memory of life, of friends and family, lost. Language, forgotten. If, hypothetically, this was all true, the plan Domimokah described did seem infinitely better than the alternative.

I looked over to Annie, whose legs carried her along, but her mind was somewhere else. Despite the story being concluded, she still seemed ensnared in all she’d just heard.

“Annie? Hey, Broadsword calling Annie-boy,” I said to her, lightly snapping my fingers. This worked in pulling her back to the physical realm, and she shook her head, and rubbed her eyes.

I remembered only then about the spotlight-thing we’d encountered before reaching this place.

“Hey, uh, about this Well thing. When we were coming up here, there was this huge beam of light coming out from these clouds. We were trying to fend off a mountain lion, and this big spotlight darted onto where it stood, and it burned. To a crisp.”

Domimokah was hesitant to answer, but relented,

“Yes, well… would you not hold some resentment for all those who caused your downfall, and bodily death? We are exempt, of course, but there is hostility against all beings that gestate thoughts within them. The judgemental eye you witnessed indeed dissolved the very consciousness of this animal, a thing bound so tightly to the body that removal leads to annihilation. That is why we are blessed, as the Well allows us to persist, despite this separation of flesh and self.”

That was all he was willing to share, apparently. He led us on silently, and before we realised, we were back at the skull room again. My memory isn’t photographic, but I could tell that the monks had not budged a single millimetre from before. The memories flooded back and I slowed my pace, cautiously.

“I have a proposition,” Domimokah announced, “I am willing to permit you a fleeting glance into the eyes of the receptors here. I do not imagine you’ll be able to remain for long, but I must offer you this, as a courtesy. Do you accept?”

I was wary, but to my surprise, Annie jumped at the opportunity. There was a glint of something in her eyes that I didn’t recognise. Something I couldn’t help but think was not herself. I stood, contemplating, as she was led over, and sat down between the others.

Domimokah crouched and leaned in close, cupping her head and whispering something to her. At this, her back straightened, head upright. And she was still.

“Well? Will you join your friend?”

I didn’t like this, but I’d also come too far to pass off the chance to validate any of these wild claims. I was so stupid, to doubt it all despite what I’d already witnessed. But this contradiction irked me… so I accepted.

Domimokah took my hand and led me over, beside Annie. I sat down, crossed my legs, and closed my eyes. I could feel him come down to my level, and he whispered to me what I’d previously not heard:

“Become one, the mind is fluid. Yours is yours, but also all, and so all is yours. Set free the bounds of your thoughts. Peer into your true nature.”

As the last word was spoken, an electric feeling shot up my spine like nothing I’d felt before. I could feel it course through every single path of neurons, every portion of my brain ignited with a shock of newly found energy. More intense it grew, and I felt the edges of my mind dissolve, the way the rubber peels away after a water balloon is popped.

Suddenly, it was as if I was rocketed upwards, far into the heavens above. All I saw was white at first, until the feeling of G’s pulling on myself ceased, and my vision cleared.

In front of me was a vast plane, rippling like the ocean surface. Unlike the previous whiteness, it was mottled, sullied with sickening hues of green, purple, brown… like endless patches of bruise and rot, eating away at the reality where I stood.

Where I stood… it would be inaccurate to say “where”, because all at once I saw it from an infinity of angles and positions, as if I were peering inwards, into my own consciousness.

Memories from places unknown filtered through me, and I remembered lives I had not lived. Names that were not mine, parents and children I’d never known. It occurred to me that I wasn’t really sure on which of them were mine anymore, unable to distinguish between my own experiences and those of people who’d died long before my birth.

Even so, all these memories were fleeting. Not one stayed for more than a moment before being replaced by another. I was Shakespeare writing Macbeth, a bullet traversed my brain as Abraham Lincoln, I hunted a mammoth with crudely made spears, I was…

I felt a scream, but with no body I heard nothing. A tingling sensation overcame me in that moment, one of irretrievable loss that burned at the fringe of my psyche, stirring all that I was in a cognitive melting pot.

Again, the sudden acceleration hit me, and before I knew it my eyes were open, finally hearing my own screams. Something was flickering in front of me, so bright, it was… it was coming from me. My eyes, my mouth… god, it burned. It hurt. I couldn’t bear it.

Domimokah was at my side, and through some esoteric practice the flames dissipated, leaving me unscathed. I sat in wide-eyed terror for a long time, before coming back to myself. Annie. I whipped around to my right, fearing the worst, but saw her with the most serene look on her face. How, how could she be peaceful in that place? I felt the question escape my lips without realising I had spoken.

“Yes, she seems to be well attuned, doesn’t she? It’s rare to see such an affinity at first communion. Exceptional!” Domimokah exclaimed.

“Yeah, it… it does seem that way.”

She didn’t return for a few minutes. Supposedly, I was only there for about ten seconds, but in that place… in that place, that span felt like countless lifetimes condensed into a single moment. I couldn’t fathom it, and I didn’t want to, to be honest.

We must have spoken for a long time as we walked before, as the sun had already started its descent. We were led back to our guest room, all the while Annie spouting revelations and realisations that meant nothing to me.

In my eyes, she was speaking complete nonsense, things so far-fetched that I had trouble understanding what she even meant. From what I could tell, it was like she’d been somewhere else entirely, in comparison to what I’d seen. The abrupt change disturbed me. She seemed almost a different person.

But god, I’m so tired now. My eyes are begging to close as I write this. Hopefully I can sleep uninterrupted tonight. We’ll leave tomorrow, I’m sure of it. I can’t imagine anything else Domimokah could possibly have to show us.

I already know that I won’t be returning as the one who came here, but I refuse to lose any more. I’m worried for Annie, too. I don’t like how she was acting, her words sounded from someplace else.

First thing tomorrow, we’re gone. If we make it out, expect an update later tomorrow.
