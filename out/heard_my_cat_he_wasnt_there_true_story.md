(This is a true story that happened to me a few years back)

I was a kid...

About 11-12 years old...

When the world was sunshine and rainbows.

My bed time was 9 o'clock after I had brushed my teeth and had a glass of milk.

Every Night my mom and dad would come up to tuck me in to bed and hug me goodnight.

Everything went as usual, just like every other night I guess.

About 20 minutes later I doze off to sleep... 

My room is pretty small, everything is relatively close to my bed, it's nothing special... But I do have a above average wardrobe since I had alot of clothes.

At the time I was left with 1 cat... One of the sadly died from lung cancer a few months before this happened and the other one went missing in the woods near my house (we live in the countryside)

I woke up around 12pm to an almost scratching like sound somewhere near me, i could tell exactly where it was since I was pretty tired... I got up thinking it was my cat outside my bedroom door wanting to come in.

I opened the door to find... Nothing... There wasn't anything there.

The hallway light was on as usual because my sister doesn't like the dark and I could hear my dad downstairs watching his computer.

I didn't think much of this and closed the door and went back to bed.

I woke up about 10 minutes later to more scratching but this time I could hear meowing.

I though to my self "what the hell is this cat doing" and went to check Infront of the door again... Once again there was nothing there.

At this point I didn't know what to think... The noise stopped so I thought maybe he just runs away when I open the door.

So I decided to stay awake this time to listen closer and maybe find him. 

5 minutes later I heard louder scratching... This time I got goosebumps.

It was from my wardrobe. I could tell since this time I was wide awake instead of half asleep the last 2 times. 
I though to myself "shit the cat is stuck in the wardrobe poor thing"

I got up

Walked over

Grabbed the handle

Started gently pulling it open

As I did that the scratching stopped.

I thought surely he's in here 

...

Nothing

The wardrobe was empty

I thought "huh" and started opening all the doors and drawers to see if he was anywhere else...

He wasn't

I checked outside my window to see if he was just trying to get in but he wasn't there

I got back into my bed and hid under the covers thinking "wtf is going on".

I was creeped out... I was sure I heard my cat I'm my room, I checked under my bed and desk... But he was nowhere to be found.

5 more minutes go by of me sitting in my bed wondering what just happened when suddenly...

*Meow*

*Meow*

*Meow*

I sat straight up and started listening very closely...

The meowing got louder and the scratching sounded like nails on a chalk board.

It was clearly coming from the wardrobe.

I nearly pissed myself. I stood up and it all stopped.

I walked over the the wardrobe and swung it open.
There was nothing there...

I rushed out of my room shouting my dad. He shortly after came upstairs and I told him what had happened...
He asked if I was dreaming while he checked the wardrobe. 

I obviously told him no, it was way to vivid to have been a dream and it just happened a second ago right before I shouted him.

He looked at me like I was insane and told me in a very soft tone "there's nothing in here, so I don't know what you heard" 

I said goodnight and got back into my bed and got to sleep... I haven't heard it since that night and I'm glad for that

To this day my dad doesn't believe me 
But I know it happened and it was the strangest thing to ever happen to me
