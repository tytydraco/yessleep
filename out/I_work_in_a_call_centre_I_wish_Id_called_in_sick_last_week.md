The title is self - explanatory, and to be honest with you, I’m sure that most people who work in call centres feel the same way, most of the time that they come in. But last week, I genuinely wish I had stayed in bed and called in sick, not like the other times when I just didn’t ‘feel’ like being at work.

 

In my job, like most call centres, there was a strict ‘no hang up’ policy. In some call centres, if someone was being strange or the call was not progressing productively, you could hang up with no repercussions, but in mine, you had to stay on the call. The only exception was if they were swearing at you personally, or if they were being racist, sexist etc. Basically, you could have someone screaming and shouting at you for 45 minutes and if they didn’t say anything that would warrant a call termination, you had to suck it up and deal with it. This is the rule that unravelled my life.

 

Last week, my day started as normal, i.e. calls would come in, I’d take details from them, I’d fix their issues/argue with them about it or just transfer them to the correct department etc, but there was a call that came in that felt… strange. Maybe it was the breathing on the other end of the line, or the general feeling of dread that seemed to emanate from the phone, but to put it simply, before words were exchanged, I knew that I didn’t want to take this call. I took a deep breath, and because its, you know, my job, I started to talk.

 

“Good morning, you’re through to Ryan, how can I help today?” I hesitantly said, hoping that the call would cut out.

 

“Life is strange, don’t you think?” a voice said, sounding like air was being forced through a small hole.

 

Usually, when callers didn’t let me know what the problem was after I asked, or when they engaged in pleasantries by asking me how I was, I’d ask again to push the conversation on, but the first thing this man said to me threw me off track.

 

“Uhh... how so?” I asked, knowing that life is strange but weirdly wanting to know what his answer was, and more importantly, why those were his first words to me.

 

“Well, there’s 30 people in your call centre, so to put it into numbers, there was a 1/30 chance that I would get you. If your colleague, Jack, didn’t ask that person if there was anything else that they could help them with, or if the lady talking to Sarah accepted that they weren’t going to get paid tomorrow due to a clerical error, their calls would have finished before I called and my call would have gone through to them, or any of your other 27 colleagues. Look at Michael, he’s even playing games on his phone!”

 

I was so confused. Was this a prank? Was this a bored QA officer who was throwing me a curve ball to see how I would react to a weird call? I didn’t know the reason, and to be frank, I didn’t care anymore. I just wanted this guy off my line. I thought I would try the old ‘Is there anything else I can help with, or is that all today?’ as 9 times out of 10, callers hung on the ‘is that all’ and said ‘no, that’s all’, saving me extra time on the call, but this guy was the 1 time out of 10 as he chuckled lightly and let me know that this call wasn’t going to end so easily.

 

“Ryan” he said, dragging my name out with a ‘tsk tsk tsk’, “We haven’t even started yet.”

 

There was a subtle feeling of heaviness that slowly but surely started to snake up my body, and it made me squirm in my seat a bit. I rarely transferred calls to my manager, because I could confidently deal with most of the calls I received and I knew that they were busy dealing with managerial things, but I really didn’t care if I failed QA for this call by transferring it.

 

“I’m going to put you on hold, if that’s ok?” I said, my finger hovering over the hold button, waiting for confirmation so that I could press that magical button and speak to my manager, but it was to no avail.

 

“You can try my dear boy, but it won’t work” the airy voice chuckled.

 

Feeling rebellious, and a bit scared at this point. I quickly pressed the hold button, but instead of hearing the beautiful tranquillity of silence, which the hold button was created for, I heard the chuckle again. The first time I heard it, it was strange, the 2nd time it was a bit eerie, and now it was downright creepy.

 

“They never listen” the caller chuckled, forcing the feeling of heaviness further up my body, becoming heavier as it went.

 

I silently asked myself ‘What the hell have I got myself into?’, and as if he was a mind reader, he answered with “You don’t want to know my dear boy, but you’re going to find out.”

 

Utterly giving up with the call, I ripped my headset off and turned to tell my manager, but what I saw wasn’t what I expected to see. Tommy was at his computer, as I expected him to be, but it was like he was a statue. He looked greyish, and when I called out to him, he didn’t answer. I thought he was a part of this strange call, like some call centre banter between management and QA so I strode around to him and went to speak to him properly.

 

“Tommy?” I asked, hoping that he would burst into laughter and tell me it was all a joke, but all I got was silence and a blank stare. I nudged him, and it was like he was made of stone.

 

“Tommy?” I asked again, hoping that he was playing the long game, and seeing how far he could push this, but then I looked at his eyes.

 

His eyes were glazed over and grey, to the point where it was like he had grey snooker balls in his eye sockets inside of eyeballs. The sight of that forced a little scream from my lips, and as I looked around for anyone that could help, I realised something that nearly floored me. Everyone was like this. As I looked around the call centre, all I could see were these grey – eyed statues, sat upright in their chairs, staring straight ahead.

 

I was going crazy. I must have been. My mind started to race, and I thought about all the things that happened throughout the day before that call came in. Was it something I ate, or was it something I drank? Was I even here, or was this an extremely long and drawn-out dream? I pinched myself, and it hurt. I suddenly realised that I was stood in the middle of the call centre, not knowing what was going on, and the 2nd thing I realised was the silence. I’ve heard the term ‘the silence was deafening’ before and I thought that it was an oxymoron, but in that moment, I knew exactly what it meant. The silence was so intense that I could hear the synapses in my brain firing.

 

I decided that my job wasn’t worth being in this situation (what is?) and I went to leave without a single care, but for reasons unbeknownst to me, I couldn’t leave. It was like there was something in front of me that was stopping me, but I couldn’t see it nor feel myself walking into it. My legs would just stop working whenever I tried to take a step towards the door, but they would work walking towards the sides of the room or the back.

 

Almost inaudibly, there was a sound that I could just about pick up on if I strained my ears, and the sound got louder the closer I got to my desk. It was coming from my phone. It was laughter. The laughter was starting to echo and reverberate around my head, and a voice from deep within the confines of my mind whispered “look around.”

 

I looked around, and that feeling of heaviness completely enveloped me and turned into an ice cold vice because the first thing I noticed was that instead of looking straight ahead, everyone in the call centre was now looking at me. Silently and blindly, they stared at me, and in that moment, I knew two things. I didn’t want them to stand up, and secondly, they wanted me to go back to my phone. Taking a deep gulp from the soles of my feet, I walked towards my desk and sat down.

 

Picking up my headset and putting it on my head felt like I was lifting a car, because whilst my body was responding to my brain’s instructions, my brain was simultaneously trying to override itself to protect me. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I got the headset back into place and waited for the voice to speak.

 

“My dear boy, you didn’t expect your day to turn out like this did you?” the voice asked, his voice a nice change from the laughter that was bouncing around my head moments ago.

 

“No, I… Uhh...” came out of my mouth with difficulty, as if my mouth was sewn shut and I was forcing my lips to move.

 

“I bet you’re wondering why I picked you, right?” the voice asked me. Answering his question, he continued. “I didn’t pick you. The reason why its you who has this call and not blonde Mia, or Andy three rows down from you is because you answered. James’ call finished a second after you answered, a second was the difference between James having this call and you. Ask me the question that’s on your tongue.”

 

“Who… What are you?” I probed, my mouth as dry as sandpaper.

 

The voice chuckled again. “There it is. I’m Dread. Nice to meet you Ryan.”

 

I thought it was just a surname but based on everything that happened since I took the call, I knew that there was more to the name than what I hoped. It dawned on me that this wasn’t a person that I was talking to. It was a thing.

 

“I can hear your brain whirring my dear boy” he chuckled, “so I’ll put you out of your misery and let you know who, sorry, what I am. As I said, I’m Dread. I am the physical embodiment, so to speak, of according to Google, anticipation with great apprehension or fear.” He laughed at that. Not a chuckle, or the (it seemed like) mocking laughter that felt like bowling balls being thrown around my brain earlier. This was genuine laughter, as if he found it funny that humans were trying to comprehend him, and worse than that, come to a shared definition of what dread was.

 

“I’ve already explained why I’m talking to you dear Ryan, but I guess the overarching question that needs to be answered is why I called, right? And the answer is, quite simply, I don’t like people being happy. I don’t like people not dreading things. And if they do dread things, like coming to work for example, I want them to dread it more. It may sound, how do you young people say it? Savage? But this is my essence. This is what I am. I am Dread. Do you think the God of War believes that ‘the pen is mightier than the sword?’ Do you think that water can be anything but wet? Dread is me and I am Dread.

 

“I’m sick and tired of baby showers, Instagram, Onlyfans, and all the things in the world that make people happy. When people are happy, they’re not dreading things, and when they’re not dreading things, I must rear my head. Even when they are dreading things, they’re not dreading it enough for my liking. I’m that feeling in your gut when you have to break up with someone. I’m that fear when you have to ‘come out’ to your parents. Think about all the scary or unpleasant etc situations in your life and specifically, think about how it made you feel. That. Feeling. Is. Me!”

 

As a complete aside to all of this, I was a heavy drug user in my earlier years. All the things you could think of, and all the things you haven’t heard of, went up my nose, down my throat and in my veins, yet none of it compared to how I felt now, listening to this soliloquy worming its way into my brain. I felt like I was having an out of body experience, but I was rooted to my chair, as if there were thick chains keeping me in place. I simultaneously felt hot and cold, tired and awake, sick and healthy, hungry and full, thirsty and hydrated. I felt like I was drowning in cement. Basically, I was messed up in a way that I’d never been before. And I didn’t know how to stop it.

 

“It wasn’t personal today my dear boy, no one got married over the weekend, no one won the lottery etc, I just wanted to spread dread to someone. It’s like the parable of the scorpion and the turtle, have you heard it? It’s a lovely little story. A scorpion asks a turtle to take him across the river, and the turtle feels a sense of dread, you see how my essence is everywhere? And the reason why he feels dread is because its a scorpion, and as we know, scorpions sting. The turtle says no based on that, because he doesn’t want to get stung, but the scorpion protests with solid logic, and tells the turtle that it would be pointless stinging him because if he does, the turtle will get injured, and they would both drown when the turtle can’t support itself or the scorpion.”

 

“Concrete logic, right? Well, the turtle thought so too and decided to offer his back to his new companion and off they went across the water. Halfway across, the turtle started to feel like he was being stabbed, and his body started to seize up. Instinctively knowing what had happened, he painfully turned around and looked at the scorpion with wide eyes and an even wider mouth and the look said it all. ‘Why did you do that?’ the turtle asked dejectedly, as he started to sink into the river. ‘It is because it is my nature’ the scorpion replied, gurgling as the water started to fill his mouth. In that story, I am the scorpion my dear Ryan.”

 

He laughed again, but this time, there was a bit of an edge in his laugh that I hadn’t heard before. There is no rhyme or reason why I am, I just am my dear boy.” He told me, making it as clear as possible to me as he could. “I’ve told you why I got through to you, I’ve told you why I called, but the crux of all of this, and the reason why we’re having this conversation, is simply because I want my presence to be known. I don’t actually wish you any harm my dear boy.”

 

Throughout everything he was saying, I was utterly frightened to say anything because I didn’t want to run the risk of interrupting him or offending him by not letting him say what he wanted to say. Whilst my mouth felt like it was clamped shut, I didn’t dare try to open it. With the last sentence though, it was like he was giving me an invitation to speak.

 

“Uhh… what do… uh what do you mean?” I asked, my voice quivering like I was asking a bully to leave me alone.

 

He laughed at this, sounding like a foghorn on a ship. “I’m not a monster my dear Ryan. Sure, I like it when people feel dread, but I don’t want anyone to feel physical pain. That’s not my job, and to be honest, as I’m sure you already know, you don’t want to meet those guys. I’m all about the emotional pain, the things you have to say or do but don’t want to etc. And basically, my dear boy, at the end of an interesting, albeit long conversation, I just wanted you to know that. I wanted you to know that I am still here, and that I will never go away. You may not see me, or even feel me, but rest be assured, I will be there. Look at what I’ve done to your colleagues. Turn around and look at them.”

 

I didn’t have to turn that far, because I slightly turned to my right and I saw a torso. Instead of stopping, I decided to turn my head a bit further and I saw more torsos. It was like a car crash, because I didn’t want to look, but I had to. Looking up, I nearly fainted when I saw what was happening. My colleagues had surrounded me and blocked me in, so close that I had no idea how I didn’t feel their presence sooner. They were stood at the side and behind me, like a mob, all staring at down at me with their grey eyes. I don’t know how or when or why it happened, but it had, and I felt like an avalanche had collapsed on me. Even though no words were said in regards to it, I knew that he had made them do it, just like he had made them go grey eyed and statuesque, and creepily look at me earlier. I quickly turned back and silently prayed that he didn’t do anything more with my colleagues, because with how close they were to me, anything else wouldn’t have ended well for me.

 

“I have power like you will never know my dear boy, but there was something about you which made me restrain myself today. Today was just a taste. And that is all it will be today. Thank you for an interesting call, and as I said, I will be around. I just wanted to put the frighteners on you today. And I’m sure you’ll say I succeeded. Goodbye my dear boy.”

 

The call cut out, and it was like I had been deaf my whole life and heard for the first time because the call centre roared to life. It was like my life was a tv show that was paused and the viewer had just pressed play. I could hear the calls, I could hear the hum of the printer, and I could hear my colleagues laughing in the break room. I rubbed my eyes a few times and looked at the time. It was 12:15. I took that call at 12:15.

 

I slowly turned around and saw Tommy, and upon seeing me, he laughed at me. “Have you been showering here or something?” I suddenly became aware of my body again and I realised that I was covered in sweat, from head to toe. Whilst the call centre was back to normal, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was very off. Not wanting to be in this place any longer, I told Tommy I was feeling sick and left in a hurry.

 

What was the reason for me telling this story you ask? The reason why is because I haven’t forgotten that call. I haven’t been back to work since I left, and I’m not going to go back. I am not going to put myself in a position where it could happen again. I’ve turned my phone off and it’s stayed off since I left that day because I was frightened that he would call me again on my personal number. I haven’t left my house or had any contact with the outside world for a week. I’ve been trying to wrap my head around the whole ordeal, and I still don’t have any answers that I’ve understood nor accepted.

 

As much as I’ve wanted him to, he hasn’t forgotten about the call either. I’ve just received an email from an unknown source. With my hands being pulled towards my mouse by an invisible force, I begrudgingly opened my email inbox and looked at the screen defeated. Tears are falling from my eyes right now as I’m reading the subject box – ‘Hi my dear boy. Did you miss me?’ I’ve tried to turn my laptop off but the glare from the screen is still lighting up my dark bedroom. I’ve thrown my laptop at the wall and it has re-appeared in my lap. From my wardrobe came a light chuckle.

 

“Told you I’d be around didn’t I, my dear boy. You didn’t think it would be so soon, did you? As I told you last time, there’s just something about you.” a voice said from the darkness at the end of my bedroom, reminding me that this wasn’t and would never be over.
