As a mother, my greatest fear for the longest time was dying and leaving my daughter to fend for herself, unprotected in a world full of challenges, pain, and chaos.

To say I was blindsided when I got the call from my husband, telling me that he had come home to find our precious Lily dead, would be a grievous understatement.

And to think that very soon, she would become the very thing that would keep me up at night... At the time, it would have seemed so farfetched. I thought the worst of it all was over.

I couldn't have been more wrong.

Lily was a great kid who did her best in school, had a decent group of solid friends... She worked hard when it really mattered. In her last year, at the age of 17, she seemed happier than I could ever imagine.

No one had a single suspicion that she might be suffering behind closed doors. Hanging one's self is such a personal and very scary death to face.

No part of me wanted to believe that she suffered silently, never reaching out to us. She left this world without ever leaving a shred of a clue that she planned to end her life.

To witness the aftermath of her very sad, very final decision completely crushed my spirit and took away my will to live.

We had her buried in the old Oilsbrooke Valley Cemetery, just down the road leading up the mountain for a good couple miles.

We wanted to have her cremated, but there wasn't much money flowing for us at the time, and with the city council offering free burials in the county sanctioned cemetery, we were in no position to argue.

The funeral and other services came, went, and like a blinding suckerpunch, it put me right on my ass in a hazy mindstate envenomed by the black abyss left in my heart by my daughter's absence in our lives.

I was dazed and confused for a long time, living at the bottom of the bottle for months, looking for the signs I may have missed in my own selfish lifestyle.

It was a brisk October Thursday night, seven months after my daughter's passing. The night air was frigid and carried the leaves outside into the sky, tumbling like acrobats through the mostly empty tree branches that shook in the whispering wind.

I was especially drunk that night, having polished off my last of a bottle of rye whiskey. The stuff was disgusting, but the little liquor store up town still hadn't restocked from the last time I hit their shelves, so I made it work.

The light breeze that puppeteered the leafless tree branches just outside would have carried the smell of whiskey from my breath and into the crisp autumn mountain air, if it weren't for the window that separated the outside world from my own self imposed prison cell.

I sat on my bed, leaning forward haphazardly and fumbling for a bottle on the floor as my vision sloshed and melted against the shadows of tree branches that danced along the walls.

As I swung my head back, I heard it.

The tapping on the bedroom window.

I didn't even register it yet as I chugged down more alcohol. It burned my throat in a familiar and welcome discomfort as I drained the bottle dry. I felt it wash down my emotions and I embraced oblivion as it welcomed me into the uncompromising darkness.

That's when the tapping on the window became too apparent, too consistent...

Even in my drunken mindstate, I realized it was the sound of something tapping rhythmically against the cold glass that lay just beyond a thick blue curtain that blocked all view from the outside world.

All I could see through the curtain was the light from the moon piercing through, and the silhouette of branches that were being pushed about in the wind.

It was hard to make out with my vision splitting into four and slowly melding into darkness, but it looked as if one of the bigger branches was reaching towards me.

Like an outstretched hand longing for the window, it's pointed appendage resembling a thin hand with wicked, boney fingers, just inches from the other side of the window.

Just before I could look away, it tapped the window again with a distinct clinking chime that sent a deep chill down my whole nervous system.

Despite being close to blacking out, I could feel the wretched shift in the night air from cool and crisp to chilling and hostile as the form of a long-haired figure became apparent in the midst of the now twisting shadows of tree branches.

Only the curtain and glass pane window lay between me and whoever this intruder was.

Her shadow was petite, her head  limply hanging to the side, almost like she was trying to lean over and look at me from under her hair and from behind the curtain.

When I noticed her, her head gave a strong twitch that looked so unnatural that I gasped and puked up a little bit in the back of my throat.

I watched as her fingers splayed themselves against the glass slowly her palms lying flat against the window.

Her shadow seemed to flicker, like a candle of pure darkness was illuminating it's ghastly essence against our reality, trying to press it's way through the light and darkness of our fragile existence.

Then I heard it. The soft and familiar voice slowly traveled down my ears and onto my spine, like ice cold fingers were walking their way along my nerves.

"Mother? Father?"

It was my daughter. My Lily had come home.

In a flash, I was scrambling to get up off the bed. In my inebriated perception, I thought maybe it really was all just a nightmare. I had been praying to God that I was stuck in the longest and most vile dream my mind could have concocted. Despite my fear, my desire to hug Lily again was stronger.

My motor skills weren't so bad while I was sitting and drowning my sorrow, but the moment I stood, my body started losing balance.

My mind wanted to run, to rip those curtains back and see my Lily, alive and well.

The liquor in me had a different plan, and perhaps, is the reason I am alive right now to share my story with you all.

As I tried to half jog through the room, I staggered and fumbled with my footing, even before I lost balance by stepping on top of an empty bottle of tequila.

I slipped and flew forward mere feet from the long curtain with my daughter's image cast upon it from the outside. My head made a violent thudding sound as the side of it smacked into the edge of my wall dresser.

Time skipped for me as my head hit the corner, and in a flash I was stirring slowly on the ground, my vision blinking in and out like a dying light bulb.

"Mother? Father? Please... Let me in. It's so cold out here..." Her weak and plea fillee voice wrought hot coals of sadness over my chest. I didn't even know what to think anymore.

My vision slowly faded as Lily's hands grasped the window, the dark shadows of her neck, bent and twisted, keeping her head up limply to the side.

As I fell into a dreamless and deep slumber, her voice rang out into my consciousness, this time with a twinge of barely contained rage bubbling from her once sweet tones.

"I'll be back tomorrow, mother. If you don't let me in, then we can't be together again. Isn't that what you want? To be a family again?"

Her voice strained through gritted teeth. As the world disappeared around me, I couldn't help but imagine she had a sinister face-splitting scowl on her shadow strewn features.

I awoke to the sounds of voices nearby. Even as my mind came back, I instinctively froze. I didn't know the woman's voice that I was hearing. The smell of pure alcohol and stale air took over my senses.

After a moment, I processed the sound of beeping machines and people moving about the room slowly. My husband's voice rang out with annoyance and disappointment.

"She's been drinking so much lately. I don't know if I can handle her anymore. I need to sit down and talk with her, but with what happened, it's hard to blame the woman... She just needs to grow up."

My eyes slowly flickered open. The doctor near me was the woman who's voice I heard before. She was peering at the left side of my head, preparing to apply a bandage to my now searing and sealed wound that was stitched up while I was unconscious.

My husband, Devin, was talking loudly on his phone. He sat on a couch lined against a wall that was covered entirely with windows. The morning sun rose behind him and shined through the window and lighting up the town below. We were up on the third floor of the hospital, my room overlooking the slowly growing bustle on the streets of Lichwood.

When Devin saw my eyes open, he didn't even smile or get up from the couch.

Ever since Lily died, things really hadn't been good between us. We were handling this situation very differently from one another. He spent more and more time at work, and I spent more and more at home.

"God damn it, Lucille, why the hell do you keep doing this to yourself?" He squeezed his temples with his thumb and middle finger on one hand, giving me a look that practically screamed his disappointment.

I tried to speak, but my voice caught in my throat. Mental images of the night before started flashing by, and I shot up straight, surprising both the doctor and Devin.

I took a huge drink of the water cup that was sat out for me, letting it's cooling flow revive my voice.

"I saw her, Devin."

He eyed me suspiciously, "What the hell are you on about, Lucille?"

I felt my eyes dart across the room as I made sure that the imprint of evil that pressed wickedly against my window the night before hadn't followed me here.

"I saw Lily last night, Devin. In the upstairs bedroom window. She tried talking to me... And I tried to let her in."

Devin gave me a look somewhere between abhorrent disgust and disbelief. He stammered and sputtered doubts like his brain was melting.

"Jesus fucking- What the fuck, Lucy?" He hadn't used that nickname since before Lily died.

In that moment, I wish he would have hugged me. I wanted him to hear me out, be understanding, just hold me tight and never let go.

Instead, he stood and walked briskly out the door, offering me nothing more than painful insults and heavy sighs of anger.

I signed myself out of the hospital around 2 in the afternoon. On the way out, I picked up my prescribed painkillers and asked the receptionist if they had seen Devin leave the hospital.

After describing him, the young man's brow furrowed and he nodded towards the front sliding doors.

"Yeah, that guy was a real fuckin' piece of work. Came barrelin' through while yelling on his phone, almost knocked Old Lady Mary on her ass on the way out. Didn't even apologize."

I felt awful that these people had been affected by our squabble.

"Did he say anything about where he's going?"

I was worried that he might leave and never come back. I couldn't do this without him right now.

"Nah, but he kept yellin' something about Oilsbrooke. That could be a lot of different places around this county."

Oilsbrooke was a common name around Lichwood. Hell the county was practically entirely paid for and owned by the Oilsbrooke family. They were a strange lot who kept to themselves.

But I knew where Devin was going. I wasn't going to stop him. I still hadn't gotten up the nerve to visit her grave site, but Devin had gone there just about every day.

I shuddered as the image of my daughter's mangled shadow flooded my mind. Maybe it wasn't real... But I have never experienced a dream so vivid that it sent that kind of terror and sadness through me.

That sight was etched into my mind, like her shadowy presence was seeping into my soul as I looked upon her.

The next few hours went quickly. I rested up for a few hours, and stayed higher than a kite on grade A painkillers.

Normally I would drink with the pills and risk it. I played things rather chaotically for months before this.

That night, though... I knew I had to keep a foothold on reality the best I could. I wasn't going to black out and dream that horrible dream again.

The sun had set. The halls of our two story home sat quiet and still. Shadows slowly crawled throughout the house as the full moon rose into view.

I sat in the bedroom, my husband's .357 revolver lying on my lap, my hands overlapping over it, holding it close as I scanned the window tirelessly.

I really didn't believe I would see anything that night. I had to force myself to think that maybe what I saw was born of the liquor, and was not real.

I kept sweeping my eyes back and forth between the window and my alarm clock. The time had just jumped from 4:07 to 4:08 a.m. 

My eyes slowly went back to the window, and I was struck by the sight of my daughter's mangled shadow.

She had appeared inches away from the window. Her blackened energy lingering just behind the curtain once again. I had left it slightly cracked, and where the shadow ended at the opening, I finally saw her again. My Lily.

Only now she was a decaying and somewhat bloated, an evil caricature of the girl I once loved and held dear.

Her dark brown hair was matted to her head with blood and mud. As her eyes scanned me from behind the glass, all I could detect was pure hatred.

Even as her eyes looked upon me with hellish scorn, her lips tightly pursed into a forced grin, like the muscles that pulled her mouth weren't exactly cooperating with her.

Her form slowly shambled up to the second story window with otherworldly ease, her form seemingly slipping in and out of strange twitching motions.

It was like she was moving and suddenly being jerked backwards by an unseen tether, towards the shadows that lay beyond the trees and homes that line our little neighborhood street.

Her twitching form stood there for a few minutes. I watched breathlessly as she started prodding the window, looking for a way to open it. It was locked.

"Mother? Open the window, please. It's so cold out in the woods."

Tears started to flood my eyes. The air around me thickened and choked my lungs the longer I stared at her. Her neck was dripping some thick looking liquid and I felt like I could smell just a small bit of rot creeping through the dimly lot room.

I fumbled with my phone for a bit while she started tapping the window with her boney fingers, the sound of bone and decayed flesh drumming along glass. I took a picture of her macabre outline and started dialing 911.

"If you don't let me in right now, Father will just have to let me in when he's done with you."

Her words numbed my mind for a moment. Devin? He wasn't even here right now. He would be at work by now. Did she plan to wait for him all night?

I couldn't let that happen.

In a panicked frenzy, I told the dispatcher to send the police to my house, that there was an intruder and they had threatened my life.

When I gave them my address, the dispatcher gave a rough sigh. He sounded oddly familiar with the area.

"North Charon Street?" He asked with a strangely understanding and disappointed tone. "Damn shame." He went quiet for a moment, then hesitantly said "I'll see what I can do, ma'am."

He hung up abruptly and I watched with wide eyes as she started scratching the window with the jagged edges of her snapped finger bones . I could see her grin stretching the corners of her mouth, even through the darkness of the night.

As her malicious form scratched the window faster and faster, I lit up Devin's number in my cell phone.

My hand held it shakily in front of me, the speaker phone ringing loudly into the slowly darkening room.

A light flickered on under the closet door on the wall to my left. My heart sank through my body as the familiar ringtone of my husband's phone played from inside, muffled by something.

The door cracked open a bit and my husband's face appeared in the opening, lit only by his cell phone that lie face up on the floor inside. Blood was pouring from the top of his head across his anger stricken face.

Devin had been scalped. Sheets of bloody flesh barely held the skin to his skull, and the entire top part of his head was torn open.

His eyes were bloodshot, full of demonic hatred that was focused directly on me. He was somehow still alive, despite his blood pooling into the now damp and sticky carpet beneath him.

A dark shadow encroached on his body, as if the soul of an evil entity was hovering just behind him. It tore from his back and filled the corners of the closet with tendrils of black nothingness.

Raw terror filled my lungs as my scream quickly flooded the air of my bedroom as Devin started pushing his way through the closet door, his form taking a menacing pose as he did, hunching over and tightening his muscles like he was straining against an unseeable force as he moved.

He started going over to the window, where I could see Lily waiting. I could hear the sound of flesh and bone rending and sliding apart. I watched in horror as eight impossibly long, black spider-like legs raised menacingly out of her back and pressed up against the outside wall. Her body lifted itself up and away from the window a few feet.

Devin was almost to the window when I remembered the revolver in my lap. I lifted it up, trying to remember the few experiences I had actually shooting a gun. I stood quickly and took some.

As I pulled the trigger, the gun popped loudly and kicked up a bit, hitting Devin in the back and sending him staggering against the wall, next to the window.

Lily's face was painted with unbridled rage, and she let out a screech that was like nothing I had ever heard before. The tones reached into the back of my mind and shook me to my core.

I kept pulling the trigger even as my senses were being scrambled. I missed every shot but two. The second hit created a gaping wound in his neck. Blood spurted out in a thick shower against the window and curtain. I watched out the window in an almost catatonic state as Devin's cries of pain and anger echoes through the room.

I watched as the flesh started to spread out from Lily's back legs in a thin webbed-skin layer. Her wicked eyes split into four, then eight flowing green orbs. I felt my stomach churn as her face split in half vertically and opened up, lined with teeth that were sharp as daggers.

As the face skin split apart, a viscous green ooze clung and dripped between the halves. The dark maw looked like it fell back into an impossibly black void. This... Thing, was not Lucy. Not anymore.

As it twitched feverishly and brought it's body closer to the window, I watched the shadow that loomed over my husband pull desperately towards the now hulking and vile beast outside.

His body began to violently seize and twitch as it tried to pull itself up from the ground. His blood flow slowed, but his movements did not.

In a flash his body was shaking and running full speed towards me, mouth now foaming a greyish green fluid as he tried to scream, choking loudly on the slimy substance.

I felt the world around me was going to shatter into a trillion pieces all around me. With a pure fight or flight reaction, I threw the empty gun with all my might, and in the same motion spun around to the door. I started to run as hard as my body would physically allow.

Even with painkillers filling the world around me I managed to put pace Devin to the door as he tried to catch his balance. The monstrous form lingering outside was screeching with a mind shattering howl.

I bolted out the door and down the stairway, hoping to make it to our kitchen to find some sort of weapon. I could hear my husband's corpse scrambling to catch up, and what sounded like a heavy scurrying sound scraping along the outer walls and roof.

Was that thing fucking following us?

I made it to the bottom of the stairs and quickly rounded the corner, going past the open wooden rail that overlooked the front room that is near the front door and the kitchen. I ran past the railing, catching a glimpse of my husband's ragged body just about falling down the stairs as he convulsed in inhuman fury. His hands grasped madly out from the railing, and his body weight shattered the stair railing as he gripped at me with a desperation Devin had never shown in his life.

He fell with a heavy crash a few feet behind me as I sprinted into the kitchen down the hall, all the while our house shook with the roars and screams of the monster that crawled about the outside.

I ran into the kitchen, turning in time to see my husband trembling and reeling body start dragging itself along the wall of the hallway, crawling across sideways, the shadowy tendrils helping him keep his grip as he shot at me with unreal speed.

Just as he made it into the kitchen, now just ten feet away, I grabbed the biggest blade out of the knife block on a counter nearby.

His shuddering body flung off the hall way wall and he crawled at me on the floor with a blinding speed, his head barely hanging on with the gunshot wound slowly tearing more as he moved about. His hands made a wet and fleshy slapping noise as he closed the distance, his bloody hand prints leaving a trail behind him.

He leapt from the floor and slammed me down with a booming thud, his eyes  prying open wider than his flesh would allow. The skin and eyelids around them stretched until his eyes were practically bulging out of his half revealed skull.

He screeched with pain as I plunged the blade into his chest, the blade crunching against his ribs and tearing open his skin and muscles. Some blood poured out, and instead of being warm and thick, it was the disgusting greenish-red sludge that slowly trickled down my arms as I kept stabbing him.

He started to throttle my neck as I stabbed at his torso. I was on my back and unable to get a good hit anywhere else as the shadowy tendrils from his back tried to hold my body down while he did.

I choked on my scream and tears as I kept thrusting the knife into him, hoping to at least go down with a fight.

My vision slowly started to fade away into nothingness, Devin's evil smile ripping the skin away from his mouth. His eyes leaked green ooze from between the slowly growing gaps in the skin around them. He began to laugh maniacally, blood spurting out of his mouth with each dark bellow.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of shoving the knife into his body, I felt Devin's grip loosen and his body started to slump down onto me. I watched as the putrid blackness exited his body and aura, leaving him a lifeless corpse that not lay on top of me. I tried to slow my heart rate as I pushed him off of me, my head spinning.

I think the painkillers are the only thing that kept me conscious as I turned and looked out the kitchen window. I sat up and saw the now blackened flesh of my daughter's split face filled with dagger like teeth watching me from right up against the glass. It didn't scream or twitch anymore. It just locked it's disgusting green eyes with mine. Staring. Longing.

As I struggled to figure out what to do next, the dark entity slowly pulled away from the house, only breaking eye contact when it reached the backyard fence. I could see it's silhouette practically floating off into the shadowy forest. The shadow of Lily's body hung limply from the sprawling entity that propped her up, like a spider that just couldn't quite hold it's body steady.

I heard the sounds of other people's muffled screaming outside as my vision slowly cleared back up. The dark being kept going until I no longer saw it from where I sat on the ground.

I shakily got up from the ground. The pain was slowly creeping in now. I studied my reflection in the window. The stitches on my head were ripped and the wound now bled across my face. I could see bruises slowly forming on my throat. And what I saw next sends chills through my brain and body every time I remember it.

In the distant treeline, as the sun finally started to peak above the horizon, I saw countless shadowy spider forms crawling away from our neighborhood. At least several dozen of those things were making their way back to the woods that lead up into the valley mountain that our little town sat next to.

Some of them appeared to be carrying human bodies in their free shadowy limbs. Some hung limply, others were still kicking and screaming as they were pulled into the wooded depths.

I could see the beings all moving with that inhuman, jerky cadence as they went running deeper into the woods, until at last, there was no sign of them left.

Multiple police cars and ambulances showed up a few minutes after the woods finally went silent, the last of the screaming fading into the trees. As I was escorted out of my house, I saw that the entire neighborhood was being brought out of their homes. Some people were crying and screaming, others stared into the distance with sunken, hollow eyes.

I remember feeling... Empty. All the adrenaline finally left my body and I hunched over in the back of an ambulance while a paramedic checked my vitals.

A tall man in a dark yellow suit walked briskly over to where I sat. He lit a cigarette and offered me one, taking a drag that illuminated his scar covered face in a soft orange glow in the morning light. I declined and softly stuttered,

"What in the hell was that thing?"

His low and calm voice rumbled as he spoke. "Trust me when I say you don't want to know, nor do you want to find out what happens if you tell anyone about what happened this morning." His brow lowered, his eyes deep in thought as he looked me up and down.

"You know, not many people survive when something dark pokes it's snout into Lichwood's streets. Consider yourself lucky. As for your home..." He looked over to the house and shook his head. As he did, he pulled a fat manilla envelope out from the inner breast pocket in his suit. "You're going to have to get out. It's city property now."

And that's just what I did. I was given an advance on the house's price, and a sizable bonus for "reparations". They said they would be watching me when I move.

The extra money felt more like a slap to the fucking face than any sort of help... But I took it anyways. Took it and ran as fast as I could.

A 'For Sale' sign was posted in my yard the same day I drove out of that horrible town.

I live far from Lichwood now. Every day is a waking nightmare, every night, a sleepless battle with my demons. The image of my beautiful Lily's face splitting apart left a seared image on my vision. Every time I hear a creak in my house, I check the windows and closets. I quit the booze, it hasn't helped since that night.

I never told anyone about this before... But after last night, I knew I had to share this with someone. Anyone. Because this morning, my neighbor approached me with the strangest remark.

The old man caught me on my way out of the house, looking a bit perplexed.

"Hey, Lucy, I just wanted to let you know... I was up early this morning, and when I peeked out my window, I saw a person standing right outside one of your windows. I couldn't get a good look, she was covered in shadows from the trees, but she looked young and rather angry. Are you expecting company?"

I choked on air for a moment, that chill of that October night from years ago creeping along my skin.

I called off of work, and now here I am. I have a lot more guns this time, set up some traps in and around the house, and as I type this out for the world to see, I can feel her gaze through the curtains behind me. Watching me. Mocking my pain.

I don't expect they will let me go so easily this time. And yet, as I finish my writing here, I can hear her already.

"Mother? Let me in. It's so cold out here, and I am [starving.](https://www.reddit.com/user/gothic-goat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"
