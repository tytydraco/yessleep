The last weekend of my summer vacation was spent in the countryside with Tony. I told my parents I’d leave his house on Sunday morning, but we had so much fun I stayed until the evening. As I was about to leave, his mom offered to drive me to the station. I refused, of course since I didn’t want to abuse her hospitality. But most importantly the sun was setting and I loved to walk alone along the cornfields.

What a beauty to behold; the last sunrays bathing those fields of green and gold in a magnificent orange hue. No people, no cars, houses scarce and far between. A lovely countryside stroll. Until that  shadow appeared from the corner of my eye. It was a lone walker in the distance. Even though I knew the locals were kind and welcoming, I couldn’t stop looking back at the coated figure wearing a hat.

*What an odd thing to wear in the summer,* I thought.

Something about him made me feel uncomfortable, so just to be safe, I took a sudden sharp turn into a smaller trail going downhill – a shortcut to the station. The moment I disappeared between the high stalks, I broke into a trot to add more distance between us.

A hundred feet or so later, I glanced over my shoulder. Not one shadow. I breathed a sigh of relief and continued, feeling a little silly.

Minutes later the wind blew a strange odor from behind, something of a mix between sweat, cigarettes and mildew. I turned my head while shading my eyes from the blinding sunset with my arm and squinted. A long shadow was creeping up to me from the top of the trail, cast by the dark hatted figure.

Instead of heading straight to the main road much further ahead, I dashed into the corn field and zigzagged between the stalks towards the station. I was certain I’d lose him that way because I used to play hide-and-seek in them when I lived in the countryside; I knew exactly how to disappear within this maze. Or so I thought…

The plants began to rustle from where I entered. I was being chased, no doubt. Adrenaline was pumping through my body and I began to run in a straight line.

I risked a swift glance over my shoulder and saw a silhouette emerging from between the crops less than a hundred feet from me. Somehow, he had managed to reduce the gap between us just like that. I immediately shot to my right, sprinted, then turned left again.

The rustling was audibly closing in on me. My heart was throbbing. I couldn’t feel my legs. It was as if my body was magically bobbing up and down midair. The maze turned into obscurity as the last sun rays made place for the moon and stars. I was exhausted but kept running. Left. Right. Then I stumbled upon something but managed to regain my balance quickly. It was dark. I continued straight for a while. Right again. I desperately tried to orient myself towards the station. But the rustle was so close I could hear him panting.

Then, hope had appeared in the form of a streetlight piercing through the crops.

*The road!*

I hurtled out of the cornfield so quickly that, had a car passed by, it’d have hit me without a doubt.

The station was right there. My legs were about to give out. Every part of my body pained me, my heart was pounding so hard inside my chest that I thought it was going to burst open. The only thing that kept me going was the faint rustle behind me. I didn’t know whether he was still there or not but I dared not look. I swallowed hard between several wheezes as I dragged my body down the road, up the stairs leading to the platform of the station. I was exhausted. Heaving. Wheezing. Hurting from all that exertion. To make things worse, the station was completely deserted. My legs were quivering as I lumbered to the timetable. Three minutes left until arrival. I initially intended to take the following train, so I could sit on a bench and let the end of summer melancholy numb my mind. But that idea was long gone. My mind was numb enough as it was. And so were my legs.

Two minutes left. The long thin seconds hand on the large station clock seemed to move in slow-motion. I scoured the platform, ready to dash anywhere. No one. I just realized how thirsty I was. The tang of iron in my mouth made matters worse.

One minute left.

*Where’s that stupid train?*

I leaned in over the tracks for any hint of its arrival. Any hint at all. Unfortunately, the curved tracks made it impossible to see far beyond.

Time was up. No train in sight. I trudged to the timetable and double checked that I read the time and weekday correctly. No mistake. It was definitely running late.

A warm breeze made me shudder and my clammy shirt didn’t help.

Suddenly, I heard a faint sound, followed by its echo.

Clomp – *clomp.* Clomp – *clomp.*

The plodding steps were drawing nearer.

CLOMP – *clomp.*

And nearer.

**CLOMP** ***– clomp.***

From the staircase on the other side of the tracks emerged a dark, wide-brim hat, followed by a gangling body wearing a navy trench coat. He had found me.

The man slowly tilted his head up, exposing everything below the shadow of his hat. A grin formed on his thick bearded face, slowly widening, first exposing his uneven teeth, then widened some more. My hands flew to my mouth, but not before I let out a muffled cry.

His beard gradually crawled out of the way, widening his mouth until it became one curved line stretching from one ear to the other, looking as if someone had nearly cut his face in half. The man then ambled in my direction, spreading his arms like a predator ready to jump on its prey from over the tracks.

As if by miracle, the train had arrived. His smile vanished and I saw him hurry back down the stairs.

He was coming.

While the train’s wheels screeched on the rails, slowing its rhythmic clatter, I scanned each compartment in search of the one holding the most passengers. I hopped on the busiest one as soon as the doors opened, containing only five people inside.

*Come on, close the doors, please close them quickly,* I thought, nervously locking my eyes on the stairs.

Flashing lights. Warning beeps. The doors were about to close when the hat surfaced from the stairway, followed by the man’s body. Three, four quick strides and he barely hopped on board. I watched him lurk up to the door of the neighboring compartment with his spidery legs. We were only separated by two doors. I felt sick. Our gazes met for an instant. He seemed to relish my terror. There was something about his eyes that made everything around us melt away, creating a world where nothing but the two of us existed, a world where only one of us could exist. And we both knew who would come on top.

I snapped out of it when he licked his lips and immediately averted my sight. My legs begged me to sit, but I dared not for fear he’d drag me into his world again. Sitting down would have only made me too vulnerable to escape his grasp.

Six stations to go.

Each time we made a stop, an impulse screamed at me to run away. To where? Another empty cornfield illuminated by nothing but the crescent moon? At least here, surrounded by a small group of people, I felt somewhat safe.

The soft rhythmic rocking of the train didn’t soothe me at all. I was tired but there was no way I’d nod off. Not with *him* nearby.

I tried to recall what lead to this, why I didn’t say, “Yes, please bring me to the station!” to Tony’s mom. The whole reason I wanted to be left alone, to wander among those fields was to imprint this colorful painting, etch it as my last summer memory of the year. Instead there was a dark blotch dripping on my canvas, and the more I tried to wipe it off, the more its grime spread onto nearby colors.

I got anxious when the train slowly squealed to a halt at the sixth station, where I had to make my connection. Most passengers got off when the doors opened. Not me. I waited patiently. Until the doors were on the verge of closing. Halfway through, I jumped off onto the platform, apologizing as I almost bumping an old lady to the ground. My stalker bewildered look made me smile nervously. The way he slowly drifted to the left side, disappearing with the train towards the next station was almost comical. But there was no time to rest. I was still half an hour from home, so I hurried to my track, where, minutes later, my connection arrived.

With quivering legs, I slumped into the seat like a sack of potatoes, face in hands. If I wasn’t in public, I might’ve cried. My body was still convulsing from the encounter. I couldn’t imagine what to do were he here again.

The thought made me jolt up. I quickly looked left and right, two, three times until I was certain no hatted man with a coat was in sight. One nearby passenger clicked her tongue and scowled while she went to sit a little further away from me. I felt bad for her because my body odor was atrocious. Or maybe she thought I was a little weird.

I sat back down and tried to peer out of the window. It was so dark outside all I could see was my own reflection. I looked atrocious. Instead, I stared at the train’s ceiling with a long sigh.

*Just a little longer and I’ll be back home, safe from everything.*

When we passed the last station before mine, I stood up and waited in front of the doors. Because we were in the suburbs, only a handful of passengers were about to exit with me. As I got off, I casually looked around and froze. One lanky leg emerged from the neighboring compartment, followed by a tall body and a hand to keep the hat from flying away. He’d been there the whole time.

I just ran. The angry voices of the passengers I collided with on the narrow platform didn’t matter. I was thirsty. I was in pain. But I didn’t care; I had to move on, get back home through the dark streets, poorly illuminated by lamps at regular intervals.

My house was on the right side of a curved street, at the end of a small industrious complex. No cars. No pedestrians. I was all alone. As I was flying through the curve I had to look behind. The emptiness of the night stared right back at me.

*Did he abandon chase? Or did I mistake someone else for him?*

I kept turning my head when, several houses away from me stood a figure, shoulders rising up and down.

“H-how…” I stammered.

I couldn’t wrap my mind around the way he arrived first. My only alternative was to return to the station and hope I could make it to the other side, where my friend Olivia lived. She was my last resort.

I don’t know how I did it. But I managed to move my legs, even though they were twitching madly, and ran. My knees felt like they were about to snap my legs in half, but I couldn’t stop. The warm summer breeze made matters even worse.

*How is he not dead from exhaustion with all those clothes on?*

The clacking echo from his shoes chasing me, akin to being pursued by an imaginary monster in the dark, frightened me so much it gave me enough strength to flee.

*Please let him fall down. Please let him go away.*

I was whimpering and tears began to slide off my cheeks.

The station was right there. I hurtled to the first row of houses. The fourth one was Olivia’s. All my thoughts and strength went into one last spurt. I leapt over the small fence, over the doorsteps and crashed hard into the door. I couldn’t stand up.

“Help! Open up!” I yelled, banging on the door. My body was completely drained, and the yells took so much of my breathe I almost passed out.

He was scaling the fence. His face was inhuman, filled with wrinkled crevasses, and eyes sparkling with hatred. But worst of all was his wide-open mouth. I could see his scars, jagged as if someone had sliced both cheeks open with a bread knife.

His long, knobbly fingers, hairy like spider legs were reaching for me. I instinctively flinched and shut my eyes when the door suddenly banged open on my head, closed, then slowly opened again.

*Olivia’s father!*

“What? WHAT?” he barked, peering from the gap. “Oh, it’s you. What’s this all about? What are you doing here?”

I immediately clutched his leg. “Man… behind… help…” I choked, holding fast. My eardrums were throbbing so hard my own voice seemed distant.

“Man? What man?” he asked, struggling out of the door I was partially obstructing, scanning the surroundings. No one was there. He’d disappeared.

“Please… let me… in…”

“Er, sure, sure,” he said. “Can you walk?” When I shook my head, he called, “Isabella! Come and help me!”

His wife hurried to the porch and they both dragged me inside, gently laying me on the couch. Isabella’s comforting voice asking me, “What’s the matter? Are you okay?” made me burst into tears, pleading to call my parents. I later learned that Olivia wasn’t home because she was staying over as I did. And that’s all right. I didn’t want her to see me in that hysteric state anyway.

Within minutes my dad picked me up and drove me home. Before I recounted my story, they gave me some time to cry myself out. My parents ended up calling the cops, who were less than helpful as they immediately discredited me because Olivia’s father hadn’t seen anyone behind me. I felt like even my parents doubted my story, even though they seemed genuinely concerned. Needless to say, I spent the last days of my vacation locked inside my room, sobbing and recovering in my bed. By some miracle, I didn’t seem to have any grave injuries.

Back at school, I told my friends what had happened. I was shocked to hear most of them calling me an attention seeker. But among the others rose an unexpected voice.

“I know the man,” Andrew interjected to everyone’s surprise. “Tall, wearing a navy coat with a fitting hat, very pale, right?”

“Yes. Yes!” I shrieked. “Have you also been–?”

“Kind of, yeah.” He shifted uncomfortably in place. “It happened in mid-August. I-I was in a public toilet, alone, minding my own business at the furthest urinal when he came in. Instead of leaving some space between us, he settled right next to me. I felt overshadowed, so I shily looked up, and saw him smile, staring at – at my dick. He wasn’t even peeing or anything, you know, he just… stood there.”

“Oh my God, what did you do?” asked Olivia.

“I wanted to tell him to fuck off, but when I saw his – his eyes, I just froze. He looked like a complete psycho or something. So I hurried and got the hell out of there.”

“And he let you go, just like that?” I asked.

“Well, not exactly. When I tried to leave, he blocked the way so I couldn’t get through. And then…” He swallowed. “Then his mouth opened from – from ear to ear. Like, it had been cut open or something. I think he was smiling, but it was so unreal to see all those jagged teeth slowly emerging from behind his beard.” He closed his eyes and furrowed his brows. “His tongue came out, like he was about to lick me or eat me or something. I was paralyzed with fear. But then someone else entered and he left. It was wild.”

My mouth was wide open. The other kids immediately bombarded us with questions. Andrew, unlike me, was the cool kid in my class, and everyone trusted him. There were still skeptics, but I didn’t care. It was weirdly comforting to hear someone else’s experience.

“If you see him again, just scream and point at someone for help, ok?” Andrew advised me, and it made me feel a bit safer.

“Who even believes this crap?” one of the skeptical girls said scornfully. It was Melissa.

“Why would we make this up?” I said irritably. “My story and Andrew’s are different, but about the same man. What’s there not to believe?”

She rolled her eyes. “Ok, where did you see him?” I told her again the exact location, and so did Andrew. Unsurprisingly, it was in the same vicinity. “Ok,” she said. “I’ll go there. This weekend. At dusk. I’m not scared.”

“Mel, just don’t,” Andrew sighed. “He might not even be there then, and if he is, you’re just putting yourself in danger.”

“Nah, I’m fine. I’ll keep you guys updated.” And she walked to another group of friends. Andrew and I stared at each other, and we both shrugged. Melissa had a big mouth, but rarely bit through it.

The weekend came. For a fraction of a second, I thought about going back to the cornfields to check on Melissa, but I was certain she wouldn’t go. Even if she did, I wouldn’t feel any safer with her on my side. At the end, I basically lived inside my room for two days straight.

Cue to Monday. Melissa was absent. At this point, we all thought it was a distasteful prank. Or that she’d gotten suddenly sick or something. We went to class, school ended, and I was back home again, being driven by my dad instead of taking the train. He was a small business owner so he could afford to take some time off work, especially for me.

At dinner, I told my parents the story, but they didn’t seem to care. “Just another stupid teenager prank,” my dad shrugged. “She’ll be back tomorrow alright.”

“Shh,” my mom pressed a finger to her lips, raising the television’s sound. A broadcaster stood in a familiar place.

“…nfield, where Melissa was reportedly last spotted on Saturday evening. Authorities are still conducting a thorough search with the help of the locals inside this cornfield you can see behind me, but as of now they haven’t found any trace of the female teenager. Her mother…”

I couldn’t believe it. It must have been a mistake, or someone with the same name. Then they showed us a photograph. It *was* Mel.

“…anyone with information to come forward and help the investigation by calling the following number…”

If our local news station wasn’t on, I could’ve heard a pin drop. My parents stared at me like their child had been swapped by an alien. Without warning, my mother hugged me. Hard.

“I’m so sorry for your friend, but I’m so glad it wasn’t you.” She sobbed, and I cried. Emotions were high for the rest of the evening.

We called the number, of course, and they took my deposition, unlike our local cops. Going back to school was… unusual to say the least. Andrew and I were the center of attention for the next few weeks or so, until the news stories began to settle.

I’ve blamed myself ever since. For telling this story in front of everyone. For not stopping Mel. I know I should’ve cried for help on the train. But then I remember his face. His eyes. And I shudder. I had been petrified then, and I would still be now were we to meet again.

The peace of mind I had when I walked outside before this incident has yet to return and I doubt it ever will. Maybe this is my punishment for letting Mel go. The old self-inflicted scars on my arm are a silent tribute to the life that was exchanged, proof that I truly am still alive, while another soul took my place. And for that sin, I am living within a purgatory of constant remorse.
