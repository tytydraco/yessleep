Hello! I'm S, I'm here to tell you some facts that I've been experiencing in the house where I've lived since I was born, but before we start I have to state some facts, firstly, the land used to be an orange grove, my parents bought it and built a house, secondly, I don't know if any ritual or something like that was done on this land and my parents don't have this information either, well let's go! (and I don't have any disorder or problem before you ask, just ADHD)

Since I was very young I have been seeing things, what many might call a medium or whatever, I never wanted to develop this spiritual side of mine, I was quite afraid, I have lost count of the many times that at night I woke up to go to the bathroom and saw insects climbing my body (no, I was not sleeping or having sleep paralysis, I could move around calmly), it all started when I was 8 or 9 years old when I saw a huge silver snake with ruby eyes (yes, literally the precious stone) on top of the house of the spiritualist neighbor on the land behind, positioning itself towards another spiritualist center, as if it was staring, you know? It never did anything, it just positions itself from time to time, maybe some spiritual protection from my neighbor? Anyway, after that I never stopped seeing things.

I see many animals and figures, but mainly animals, specifically a wolf, he has a very long history with me, maybe in another post I will tell, anyway, he or more from what I believe she is the one that appears the most, walks around the corners of the house, I never see her from the front, always in the corners, but clearly a canine shape, apart from the noises, paws and nails scraping on the floor walking slowly, sometimes when I am sleeping I feel a great weight on my legs, one day I was sleepless lying in the dark and I felt the weight, I dared to put my hands where I felt it, well, the fur was incredibly hairy.
Remembering she is not black, like the color, but rather smoke! something that forms and disappears. Also has a cat the same way as her, I often confuse it with mine.

but of all the events, the figures are the worst, most of the time they have human or humanoid forms, they always scare me in some way, but they obey when I tell them to get lost, for some time now it's been getting worse, I feel like I'm being watched, I always see something, but the worst was last night.

We had a blackout in the city, everything was dark for 8 hours straight. It was night when this happened. I finished dinner, gathered up the plates with leftovers and put them in the sink. I fed the animals. I was talking to my parents in my backyard. I went inside to get something. I don't remember exactly what. That's when I saw a vision that disturbed me and still gives me goosebumps as I type. A creature the size of a cat, maybe a little bigger. I even thought it was one of my animals, but no. Oh God, how I wish it was. It had little horns and a tail, hands like a baby's. I couldn't see clearly. It was some kind of smoke. I was thankful for that. I was eating the leftovers. I froze completely, but I told it to get out of there. The creature evaporated. I quickly threw all the food away and left the kitchen.

I am extremely disturbed by what I saw, not in terms of fear, but what was that thing doing here?! I never invited anyone or anything, well these are just some of the events here, I hope you were entertained, and if anyone has any idea what these things are!
