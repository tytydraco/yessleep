My name is Charles Deller and my friend recently passed away. They left me a note on their desktop, and I wanted to share their story as it could maybe help spread awareness of the horrors of this world.

 

If you’re reading this, it means that I’ve fortunately passed, and you can call this my sort of “note”. This here is going to tell you everything… Who I did it for, when I did it, and most of all who drove me to do it.

 

The earliest memory that I can remember that had an impact on my life was when I was fourteen years old. I lived with a broken family, which was almost as broken as the trailer home I lived in. I only had one brother, his name was Peele, don’t ask me why, that’s just what my mother thought sounded good.

Our father wasn’t present, which turned our mother into an addict of every drug and consumable to exist. She was an alcoholic, a drug addict and a prostitute but at the time I thought those men who’d come to our trailer every few days were just some of her friends.

I was returning from school with a dull attitude that day due to the fact that I got bullied for wearing the same clothes every day because we couldn’t afford anything else. Mom was in her room, or side of the trailer I guess when we heard the usual noises that come from there.

“Mom has one of her friends over again” Peele whispered to me from the couch that was facing the wall. I  fnodded at him and went to our room.

I put my headphones in on full blast and laid down on my bed. I couldn’t help keeping my eyes open and fell asleep before I could even change my clothes.

I woke up and it was dark outside. I thought it was strange no one woke me up for dinner, but I thought nothing of it, we probably couldn’t afford dinner tonight. I stood up and walked out of my room. Peele was… on the floor.

He was laying face down in the carpet of the trailer. I went to go tap on his shoulder in case he fell asleep but nothing, he didn’t move an inch or make any sound at all.

I turned him over to see his face, but I saw more than I could have ever wanted to. His stomach was…open, his intestines flopped out of him when I turned him over. I could barely hold myself together and gagged numerous times trying to keep myself from throwing up.

There was so much blood, more than you could ever know. I fell back onto the carpet as my brain was completely blank, how the hell did mom not find him before I did and who the fuck did this to him?

Maybe mom took something that was laced and had an episode? No, I didn’t see any sort of fight, or anything broken at all. I grabbed my phone and dialed 911 faster than my fingers could keep up. “911 what’s your emergency?” The operator said smoothly. M-my brother h-he’s dead. “Ok hold on sir” I could hear them typing away on the other end of the line.

“Are you there now? If so where are you located?” Y-yes, I’m on 1423 New Forest Street, Trailer 12. “Authorities will be there in a few moments sir, do you know if the assailant is still there?” I say no, as I stand up. Walking to my mom’s room, I start to smell something horrible. It can’t be…no. My eyes started to tear up and I opened the door to her room.

She was on her bed, naked with cuts and bruises everywhere. She was naked and there was blood in places I wish I had never seen. She had a used condom stuffed into her mouth. I ran out the room and out of the trailer as fast as I could and told the operator about what I had just seen.

“Police should be arriving at your location now” the operator said as I dropped the phone into the grass, and I started throwing up so much I thought my stomach was about to burst and passed out. I woke up to a policeman wrapping me in a blanket with red and blue lights everywhere.

“You’ll be ok soon, were here now” he said as he loaded me into an ambulance, it was so bright the lights of the cab blinded me as I faded in and out of consciousness. I woke up to the same bright lights to a man standing next to me.

“You’ve been out for quite a while, I’m glad you’re finally awake, my name is Detective Andrews and I wanted to ask you some questions”. I rose from my sleeping position and looked him in the eyes. “Do you have any idea who may have done something like this?” He asked me.

Umm... My mother did have men over all the time some of them did look sketchy time to time, but I never thought much of it, I said to him. He wrote some things in his book he had in his hands. “Did you notice anything suspicious about when these men were over? Such as strange sounds or screaming coming from the room”? I mean... occasionally I’d hear weird grunting sounds and moaning from there but that’s about it. He once again started writing on his clipboard. 

After about three minutes of writing, he looked at me and said “son, you’re going to be sent to a foster home in the meantime while we try to contact any relatives of yours”. My brain was immediately filled with memories of my family and everything that led up to this day. I can’t just leave… can I?
