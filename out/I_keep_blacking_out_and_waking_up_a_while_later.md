I know that the term a while is pretty vague but it's the only word I could use to describe it, the shortest I've blacked out for is 2 hours and the longest is 3 months and everytime I black out I wake up with a bloody nose. I don't remember all of the times but here are the ones I do remember




Oh yeah, I should also mention I'm a conjoined twin. It's a weird type of conjoinedness, I'm conjoined to my brother (whom the doctor ruled dead) at the spine and we each have a pair of arms, legs and a head, as long as other parts of the human body except the spine, there is only 1 spine between the both of us which was supposed to cause some weird numerological connection issues but never has. He was never removed as the surgery was too risky and I had a 98.63% chance of dying




The first time I remember blacking out was when I was 5 and my new born cousins came to visit. 3:52 pm was the time I remember after my parents asked me to check the time as they were supposed to be there 20 minutes eailier. After I blacked out I woke up holding my baby cousin who seemed irritated. I then got fed up with him so I took out his pacifier and threw it across the room put him down and wiped my nose. In my defense I could've sworn I heard my aunt say to do that because he was irritated which was making me agitated. At the time I thought the reason my nose was bleeding was because I was stressed




The second time I blacked out I was 9. I believe it was for a day or 2. One thing I remember was doing homework that was due on Wednesday and then blacking out and waking up on Friday afternoon in a Dollar Tree as blood from my nose dripped onto a king size Hershey cookies and Cream bar. Someone behind me said "it's okay, take the candy bars and hide them quickly in youre pocket" so I took all 4 from the cardboard box they were in and put them into my pocket as I ran out of the store.




The third time was when I was 11. I remember playing with my kickball in my backyard on the 11th of May blakcing out and then waking up on the 26th of June holding my bb gun that my dad has given me (he's a hunter). I was looking at a squirrel so high up in the trees, it hadn't seen me. I pointed my bb gun away from the paper targets I've been using, and pointed the gun at the squirrel then pulled the trigger. It dropped. I ran over to the dead squirrel and a voice that sounded like my dad's say "it's okay, squirrels are in season, mom could probably cook us a nice squirrel stew." So I picked the squirrel up and ran back inside to show my mom. She screamed when she saw. I was just there smile holding the decomposed corpse of a squirrel that looked like it's been sitting outside for several years. "Hey mommy you can make a nice stew out of this, can't you?" I said.




The fourth time I blacked out was when I started high-school. I remember it being 2 months before a game I wanted release and when I woke back up I had already beaten that game. I didn't wake up in my house, I woke up in school going to my 7th period in room 102 class when I heard a voice of a popular dick head behind me say "look at that freak, he's never going to get laid, what girl would want that mutant." I turned around and lunged at him and smashed his face in getting my nose blood and his blood all over his body. The school said that they didn't know what was going in with me lately but this was the last straw and I was expelled. When I said that the kid had it coming the principal said that other students in the hall at the time confirmed that he said nothing to me and I just lunged at him for no reason. I begged them to not expell me they said that between the out bursts I had over the last 3 months and my grades dropping and this that they had no choice but to expell me. When I said I had no idea what they were talking about, they should me my reports card and how the last 3 months I've been averaging a D- when I'm usually a straight A. They also informed me of when I had to go to the pricipals office last month for telling Patty Robinson to "shut her f*got a** up." I turned around yelling that "this is bullshit" as I turned around to leave they screamed as my brother's head started pouring blood out of all the holes, his eyes, his nose, his mouth, his ears. I went to they doctor and they confirmed that he wasn't alive and shouldn't be doing that and the surgery was still too risky to do.




The latest time I remember blacking out was 4 weeks ago and waking up today. I was holding my dad's hunting rifle and 50 rounds of spare ammunition as I alone stood in the empty school parking lot as my best friend's voice behind me said "their rules are bullshit, their society is bullshit, so let's show them what we do to bullshit."
