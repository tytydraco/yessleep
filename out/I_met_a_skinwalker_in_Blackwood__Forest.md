I’ve always loved solo camping. The isolation of Blackwood Forest has always offered a perfect escape from the relentless grind of city life. My name is Jake, and solitude is where I find my peace. My job in finance is demanding, and the constant pressure and deadlines leave me yearning for these wilderness retreats. Every few months, I pack up my gear and head into the forest, which has always felt like a second home. Until this trip, I had never experienced anything unusual in those woods. But this time, something felt different from the moment I arrived. The forest seemed darker, more oppressive. The trees loomed like silent sentinels, their gnarled branches casting eerie shadows. Despite this, I brushed off the unease and set up camp, determined to enjoy my weekend retreat.

By dusk, I had my tent pitched in a small clearing and was gathering wood for the fire. The process was almost meditative, a familiar routine that usually helped ground me. As twilight deepened, the forest came alive with the sounds of nature settling in. The first stars appeared, their distant twinkle stark against the enveloping darkness.

The fire crackled to life, its warm glow offering a small measure of comfort. I settled into my chair with a beer, trying to relax and embrace the tranquility. But tonight, the usual sounds of the forest—the chirping crickets, rustling leaves—felt more menacing than soothing. It was as if the forest had a heartbeat, each noise echoing unsettlingly close. The vibrant rustle of leaves seemed to carry a darker undertone, and even the crackle of the fire sounded hollow.

I tried to lose myself in a book, but the growing darkness seemed to seep into my thoughts. Every gust of wind and snap of a twig kept me on edge. I checked my watch repeatedly, the minutes dragging as night deepened. The shadows grew longer, creeping up on the edges of my firelight, and the once comforting flicker of the flames began to feel inadequate against the encroaching darkness.

As the night wore on, the noises grew stranger and more unnerving. The crickets’ chorus faded into silence. The wind died down, and the rustling leaves ceased. The usual nighttime symphony was replaced by a suffocating silence. An oppressive stillness settled over the area, amplifying every creak and groan of the woods. The silence felt heavy, almost like it was pressing in from all sides.

Then, a low, guttural growl pierced the darkness. It seemed to vibrate through the ground, resonating deep within my chest. My heart pounded, and a cold sweat broke out on my forehead. I scanned the darkness beyond the firelight, trying to locate the source.

“What was that?” I muttered, barely above a whisper. My voice felt strange in the silence, almost like an intruder. I grabbed my flashlight and directed its beam into the darkness. The light fell on something—a shape just beyond the fire's edge. At first, it looked like a deer, partially obscured by shadows. But as I squinted, I saw its eyes. They glowed an unnatural red, piercing through the darkness with a malevolent gleam.

A chill crept up my spine. “Hello?” I called out, hoping for a rational explanation. The creature remained still. Then, it let out a scream—an unearthly wail that defied explanation. It started as a deep, resonant cry, like someone in immense pain, and then morphed into a high-pitched shriek that echoed through the forest like a banshee's lament. The sound felt like it was tearing through my sanity, growing louder and more distorted the more I struggled to comprehend it. It was as if the scream was feeding off my fear, intensifying with each passing moment.

I stumbled back, dropping my flashlight. The beam flickered and died, plunging me into darkness. I fumbled with my tent's zipper, my hands shaking uncontrollably. Inside the tent, I tried to calm myself, but my heart pounded so hard I could barely breathe. I grabbed my hunting knife, trying to reassure myself that I was safe. But the forest had other plans.

The minutes stretched into hours, and every rustle of leaves or snap of a twig outside made me jump. I tried to stay awake, my eyes darting around the dark interior of the tent, but exhaustion began to take its toll. I dozed off, only to be jolted awake by a sound that made my blood run cold: that same guttural growl, now much closer.

My heart raced as I held my breath, straining to listen. Something was moving outside my tent, circling it slowly. The sound of its footsteps was heavy, deliberate. Then, I heard a voice—eerily like my own, but twisted and distorted.

“Jake... come out and play...”

I froze, unable to comprehend how it knew my name. The voice continued, repeating my name in a way that was both familiar and horrifyingly wrong. It sounded like someone was mimicking me, but couldn’t get it quite right, each repetition more garbled and unsettling than the last.

Summoning all my courage, I unzipped the tent just enough to peek outside. The fire had long since burned down to embers, casting eerie shadows on the trees. My flashlight lay where I’d dropped it, its beam flickering weakly. And then I saw it. The creature stood at the edge of the clearing, its form shifting and contorting. One moment it looked like a deer, the next it resembled a monstrous version of a human. Its limbs elongated and twisted at unnatural angles, its skin rippling and crawling as if something underneath was trying to escape. Its eyes, still glowing that hellish red, locked onto mine.

“Jake... come out...”

It took a step closer, and I saw the blood. Its mouth and hands were smeared with it, and in its hand, it held something small and dripping. My stomach churned as I realized it was a rabbit, its body torn apart, entrails dangling like grotesque ornaments.

I scrambled back, tripping over my gear, my mind racing. Skinwalker. The term surfaced from some long-buried memory of campfire stories—creatures that mimic human voices, take on the appearance of animals, and wear the skin of their prey. My skin prickled with fear.

The creature began to tear at the tent, its claws ripping through the fabric with a horrifying ease. I slashed at it with my knife, feeling the blade connect with something solid. It screamed again, that same inhuman wail that made my ears ring and my blood run cold. I bolted from the tent, running blindly into the forest.

Branches whipped at my face and arms as I tore through the underbrush. My lungs burned, my breath coming in ragged gasps. I could hear it behind me, crashing through the trees, getting closer. I stumbled into a clearing and saw an old, abandoned cabin. Desperation fueled my steps as I ran inside, slamming the door behind me.

The cabin was dark and musty, the air thick with decay. The silence inside was almost as oppressive as the sounds outside. I could hear the creature scratching at the walls, circling, searching for a way in. The scratching was relentless, a constant reminder of the danger just beyond the walls. I backed into a corner, clutching my knife, every nerve in my body screaming for escape.

Hours passed, the scratching and growling outside relentless. Just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore, dawn broke, light filtering through the cracks in the walls. The noises stopped. I waited, holding my breath, until I was sure it was gone. I slowly made my way outside, my body trembling with fatigue and fear.

The forest was eerily silent. My camp was a wreck. My tent was shredded, my gear scattered and torn. The fire pit was nothing more than a blackened scar on the ground. The surrounding trees seemed to bear witness to the chaos that had unfolded. I quickly grabbed what was left of my belongings, my movements frantic. The sense of urgency was overpowering. I couldn’t get out of those woods fast enough. My steps were hasty, my mind racing as I pushed through the dense underbrush, the feeling of being watched never leaving me.

Once I reached the edge of the forest, I didn’t stop. I kept moving until the trees were nothing more than a distant line behind me. I didn’t dare look back, fearing that the thing might still be out there, lurking just beyond my sight.

I don’t know what that thing was, but I’ll never go back to Blackwood Forest. Sometimes, late at night, I still hear that voice in my head, calling my name in that twisted, mocking tone. I wonder if it’s out there, waiting for me to make another mistake. The thought is a constant, gnawing dread, a reminder of the darkness that lies hidden in the places we think we know best. It’s a fear that has taken root deep within me, an unsettling echo of an encounter I can never fully escape.
