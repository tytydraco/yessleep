The second person they sent in was Karl Redding.

He worked a late shift and kept mostly to himself. Ex-military. Clean psych eval. No spouse. No listed next of kin. I always figured that was part of the reason they chose him.

His instructions were simple: enter Corridor 9A, which had been sealed for days after an unscheduled fog event, walk ten meters in, stop, wait, and walk back.

No sampling. No contact. Just presence.

The whole exposure lasted under two minutes.

He returned silent, pale, but not visibly shaken. Not at first.

When someone asked how it went, he paused, looked confused, and said:
“I think I was already in there.”

That was Day One.

On Day Two, he showed up early. Didn’t speak to anyone. Sat at his station for a full hour without logging in.

By Day Three, he had stopped sleeping. Not in a manic way—he just didn’t feel tired.

By Day Four, he began answering questions before they were asked.

The week after, someone found him in the breakroom staring at the vending machine with his hands pressed against the glass. When asked what he was doing, he said he was “trying to make it line up.”

Redding was reassigned shortly after. No farewell. No announcement. His clearance was pulled and scrubbed. The nameplate at his workstation was gone the next morning.

But that was just the start.

They never called the next wave of tests “exposures.” The wording on the logs changed. We started seeing things like “proximity monitoring” and “non-contact behavioral assessment.” Most of them were under ten minutes. Some were under three.

But whatever the time, the results were always the same: the people who came back weren’t exactly the people who left.

Sylva was next. A data tech. She spent ninety seconds in a fog-sealed corridor and came back complaining of a sharp pulsing in her sinuses.

She said the fog “made a sound.”

When asked to describe it, she got frustrated. Not loud. Not a tone. Not vibration. She finally said:
“It wasn’t in my ears. It was like it was trying to think for me. Like the sound was… for me.”

The next day, she refused to enter the south wing at all. She said it made her feel “recognized.”

Her badge was deactivated three days later. No exit interview. Her entire presence in the system was marked as “temporary.”

Then came Nichols.

He was in for four minutes.

Afterward, he stopped acknowledging his own reflection.

He didn’t panic. He didn’t say it was haunted. He just calmly told a medical officer that the man in the mirror was “not me anymore.”

He referred to his reflection as “the other one.”

He covered the mirrors in the facility restrooms with paper towels. Taped over his watch. Even unplugged the microwave in the breakroom because the door was too reflective.

He said:
“He’s not copying me. I’m copying him. And I don’t know who starts first anymore.”

He was placed on medical leave and never returned. His quarters were emptied within twenty-four hours.

Others started showing subtler symptoms.

One tech wrote down a series of internal routing codes on a post-it note at his desk. He said he had dreamt about them. That they’d shown up on a flashing screen he couldn’t read in the dream, but when he woke up, the numbers stayed with him.

They matched blueprints for a planned wing of the facility that hadn’t been built yet. Construction started six weeks later. One of the codes he wrote down—before the blueprints were finalized—was stamped on the new corridor’s server access panel.

I checked it myself.

And then there were the physical effects.

Grahn was in exposure for three minutes. When he came out, his fingernails had grown the equivalent of two days. We confirmed it with pre- and post-scan data. The nails weren’t stretched—they were generated. Grown.

He didn’t notice.

But he started pressing his palms flat against the corridor walls every time he passed through the lower levels. Both hands. Slowly. Like he was trying to feel something shifting behind the concrete.

Eight days later, he was found sitting on the floor of the sublevel stairwell. Curled up. Unresponsive.

The only thing he said, over and over, was:
“The corners don’t match. I was trying to fix them.”

He never came back to work.

I started to keep my own records.

Off-site. Paper. No digital trail. I didn’t trust the logs anymore. Too many names removed. Too many strange reassignments. Too many people I knew just gone.

The fog began to show patterns, too.

It started appearing near people who had been exposed. Sometimes within hours. No vents, no airflow patterns, no logic. One technician returned to her dorm and found fog pressing faintly against the inside of her window.

That room was on the second floor.

I ran an unauthorized test of my own. I left a hidden camera in Corridor 3A overnight. It wasn’t connected to the internal system—just an off-the-shelf rig tucked behind a ceiling panel.

For hours, nothing happened.

Then, at 2:14 a.m., the frame warped.

Not static. Not failure. Just… bent. Like the image was twisting around something I couldn’t see.

For seven seconds, the entire hallway looked mirrored. Every label reversed. Every panel flipped. The shadows were wrong.

And in the middle of the frame stood a figure.

Unmoving.

Not walking. Not entering frame.

Just… there.

Tall. Pale. Slightly wrong in proportion, like someone had tried to make a person out of memory and didn’t get the shape quite right.

It didn’t move.

It just stared—if it had eyes. I couldn’t tell.

The frame glitched once more.

And then it was gone.

When I played the footage back the next morning, those seven seconds were gone. Not glitched. Not corrupted.

Black screen.

Timecode still intact.

But the moment had been removed.

We were told the fog wasn’t sentient.

That it wasn’t alive. That it was just an environmental anomaly. Electromagnetic variance. Maybe even temporal drift—whatever that meant.

But none of that explains why it started appearing where we were going, not where we had been.

None of that explains why it only ever disrupted footage when no one was watching live.

And it definitely doesn’t explain why, on more than one occasion, I walked past an empty room…

…and saw my own back walking into it.
