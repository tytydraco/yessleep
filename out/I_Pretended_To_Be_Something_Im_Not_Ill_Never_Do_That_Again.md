I wasn't a bad guy, not really. I was just a nobody who wanted to be a somebody. Her name was Julie. She was a history buff, and she loved a good story, especially about heroes. I'd been trying to get her attention for weeks, and my meager life as an IT technician wasn't cutting it. That's when I saw them at a pawn shop on a rainy Saturday morning.

A mahogany display case, lined with faded velvet, held a collection of military medals. They were old and tarnished, a Purple Heart, a Bronze Star, and a handful of campaign medals. I asked the owner about them, and he just shrugged. “Came from an estate. Old guy, no family. Just a bunch of junk.”

To me, it wasn’t junk. It was an identity. A shortcut to being a man worthy of a good story. I haggled the price down and walked out with the case, the glass cold against my fingers, a strange, low hum seeming to emanate from within. I told myself it was just the city traffic.

The first date I wore them, I felt a kind of swagger I’d never known. Julie's eyes lit up when she saw them pinned to my chest. "You never told me you were a decorated veteran," she said, her voice full of awe. The lie felt so easy, so natural. As she talked, my left shoulder suddenly flared with a searing, phantom pain, so sharp and unexpected that I flinched. I gripped my drink to keep from dropping it. Julie didn't notice, but in the polished metal of a light fixture behind her, I saw a fleeting, distorted face, its features twisted in a silent scream. It was gone in an instant.

Over the next few days, the pain returned. It wasn't a dull ache; it was specific. A hot, tearing sensation, like a bullet had just ripped through my flesh. It would come on without warning, a quick, agonizing jab that left me gasping. That’s when the nightmares started. I wasn't me anymore. I was in a trench, the air thick with the smell of mud, blood, and cordite. My lungs burned, my arm was on fire, and I could hear the screams of men I didn't know.

The dreams bled into my waking life. I'd catch glimpses of men in old uniforms standing in my periphery, their faces gaunt, their eyes hollow. I’d hear whispers. "Liar." "Thief." "Coward." The voices were thin, like paper, but they were full of a furious, cold rage. The Bronze Star, in particular, seemed to hum with an unsettling energy. It was a medal for heroism, and every time I looked at it, I felt a deep, profound shame that wasn't mine. It belonged to the man who earned it, and he wanted it back.

I stopped sleeping. I stopped eating. My skin became a sickly grey, and my eyes sank into dark, bruised hollows. The phantom pains had become a constant, gnawing presence. Every time I looked at Julie, the guilt was a heavy stone in my stomach.

One night, the whispers became a cacophony. I was standing in my living room, the medals on the shelf, their glass case humming with a low vibration. The shadows in the corners of the room deepened, twisting into indistinct shapes. The temperature plummeted, and a voice, cold and clear and absolutely furious, cut through the noise. “You think you can wear our sacrifice like a costume?” it snarled.

A crushing weight slammed into my chest, knocking the wind from me. I fell to my knees, gasping, as an invisible pressure held me down. I could feel cold, skeletal hands pushing into my ribs. The men were here, all of them, and they were angry.

With a final, desperate surge of adrenaline, I crawled to the shelf, grabbed the case, and ran out the door. The only way to make it stop was to give them back to their rightful owners. I couldn’t find the men, but I could give the medals a home where they would be respected. The local historical museum.

The curator was a kind, elderly woman with sharp, intelligent eyes. I told her a fabricated story about finding them and wanting them to be displayed. She accepted them with solemn gratitude, promising to give them a place of honour. When I handed over the mahogany case, a faint, sighing sound, like a collective exhalation, filled the quiet room. The humming stopped. The phantom pains vanished. I felt lighter than I had in weeks.

That night, I went to Julie's apartment. My hands were shaking, my face was gaunt, and I didn't have the medals. The story I had so carefully crafted was gone. I just told her the truth, every ugly detail of it, the lie, the pawn shop, the terrifying haunting, the trip to the museum.

She didn't get angry. She didn't yell. Her face just went pale as she stared at me. Her eyes, which had once shone with admiration, now held a cold horror. Not at the medals, or the ghosts, but at me. I was a stranger to her, an empty costume. "I don't know who you are," she said, her voice filled with disgust. "You lied to me this whole time."

She closed the door, and that was it. I never saw her again.

I'm free of the haunting, but not of the memory. I know people will say it was just psychosomatic or a product of guilty conscience, but I know what I felt, I know what I experienced. It was real.
