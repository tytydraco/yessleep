My grandma has lived in Colorado County, the literal middle of nowhere, her whole life, she just recently moved out into the country, and me and my wife were visiting for Easter.

“How do you not know where her house is?” my wife questioned.

“She just moved, and I can’t get any service” I explained.

“Well, it’s your grandma you should know where she lives. Let’s just start driving back to town” she had a map sprawled across her in the front seat. She deeply examined it and gave me a puzzled look.

“I know the highway should be somewhere around here, I’ll just try to find it.”

A storm had grown in front of us it was tall, wide and the darkest shade of gray you can imagine.

“Didn’t know it was supposed to rain today” I commented, I wish I knew what was about to happen, how my life would change. I wish I could’ve gotten me and my wife out of there but before I knew it we were consumed by the darkness of the clouds. A lightning bolt struck right in front of us on the road, except it didn’t look like lightning, it was a light that looked like a tall skinny man with no hair anywhere on his body, he was naked but didn’t have any private parts.

“You have wandered too far” the man’s deep voice echoed. The lightning, the clouds, trees, bushes, and the rain all turned red. He reached up into the clouds and grabbed a funnel cloud. he proceeded to slam it on the ground, which made a thundering boom, as soon as it hit the ground we were tossed in the air. We were both stunned with fear so we didn’t make any noise until my wife screamed right before we hit the ground.

I woke up from the inky blackness of sleep, I don’t know how long I was out but it felt like an eternity. My memory was hazy, it could have just been from my head slamming into the steering wheel, I couldn’t remember what I had for breakfast. I turned to look at my wife to see if she was okay.

The sight I saw still petrifies me to this day, glass covered nearly every inch of her body. She had a piece of metal impaling her head to the seat. Her head twisted to look at me tearing pieces of her face off.

“Run” she whispered. It wasn’t a regular whisper, it sounded like she hadn’t drunk water in a year and she couldn’t catch her breath.

I quickly opened the door and got out grabbing my handgun and stuffing it in my waistband as I did. I didn’t look back, I didn’t want to see her like that. Thinking about her even now makes me want to throw up.

We were thrown into a field, I noticed a big red pillar of light piercing through the clouds and decided I might as well head that way. Something ran out the bushes and stopped and stared straight at me. Now that it was in front of me I could see it was clearly a deer. The deer screeched a high pitched, deafening scream. It ran right into the barbed wire fence in front of us cutting its stomach open and making its intestines dangle outside its body. The deer lowered its head and then plowed itself into a tree. Brain and skull fragments flew everywhere and some landed in my mouth, I spit it out and wiped my face only to realize my face was soaked in blood. The deer just got up, with its upper part of its head missing, and casually walked away. The only part of its head left was its jaw. But it continued to make its high-pitched screaming noise as it walked off.

As I finally neared the road I saw another creature, except this wasn’t a deer, or any animal I have ever seen. It was a tall, lanky, humanoid creature that stood on all four. The creature was a light, pale gray and it was about 10 ft tall on all fours. Its eyes were lifeless circles of black and its mouth looked like a stab wound with rows of teeth. As soon as my foot touched the asphalt its head snapped to me.

“Hey Zach, follow me I know how to get us out of here,” it was mimicking my wife’s voice, and how the hell did it know my name.

“What the fuck,”

“There is no need to be afraid,” it replied in a little girl’s voice.

“I’m not going with you, I need to get out of here. Some real freaky stuff is going on and I want nothing to do with it.”

“I’m just going to bring you where you belong,” it said in the lightning man’s voice and it held it’s hand out to me.

“And where is that?”

“HELL!” it screeched in a demonic voice. The thing grabbed my wrist and began to drag me. I got out my hand gun and began shooting at its face, I hit it 3 times, and it didn’t even flinch just kept dragging me. The only damage that was done were holes the size of the bullet going straight through its head, black liquid seeped out the wound and ran down its face. Thinking quickly, I shot at his wrist, the bullets severed its hand off and I booked it out of there running into an overgrown forest off the side of the road. Thankfully it didn’t follow me.

I wondered around in the forest for what felt like an hour, I couldn’t see the sun because the thick canopy blocked it out. It didn’t seem like it should have been in the same place where my wife got killed but I knew it was because the all the plants leaves were red. The wildlife ran around me and I could hear the constant echo of birds singing.

When I’d finally got out of the forest I came to this gravel road that had a fork in it, in the middle of the fork there was a tree with a slab of wood nailed to it. The slab of wood had the word “Deadwood” etched into it. “that’s what this place is called then,” I’d said. I looked up into the eeriness of the red thunderstorm cloud that shot lightning from itself every once and a while. my eyes were drawn to the red column of light protruding into the sky, the clouds around it circled the beam of light. I had gotten closer and it looked like it was a mile or two away, so I chose the gravel road which headed toward.

As soon as I stepped onto the gravel road I choose to use everything went quiet. No more birds signing, the gravel didn’t crunch when I walked on it, there was no noise at all. I thought it was peculiar but there had been crazier stuff to happen that day so I didn’t pay any attention to it. I continued walking down the gravel road, I tried to start whistling but no sound came out. I was tempted to take out my gun and shoot but I only had 5 rounds left. I stepped off to the ditch on the left side of the road. As soon as I did I could hear the birds singing, and my feet crunching the grass underneath me. A wave of relief overtook me and I resumed my walk towards the pillar of light.

I walked for hours. It seemed like I only got like 100 feet every hour but I didn’t care. I wanted revenge on that asshole light beam man. There was a thick, dark forest in front of me but I could tell that after that it was the obelisk of light. I jogged through the forest seeing glimpses of weird animals as they dashed in front of me. Humanoid horses, Massive dogs with three heads, ostriches that could fly.

I came out of the forest in front of a huge archway. It read: You Have Now Entered the Domain of Zeus.

“Zeus?” I questioned skeptically. As I did thunder cracked overhead. I looked past the archway to see a pyramid (like the one I’ve seen in Memphis) with the top transmitting the light.

“I hope this is the asshole that killed my wife” I quipped as I walked through the arch. As soon as I did the weather turned clear, it looked like a sunny day. I walked back and forth through the arch a couple times watching the weather change. Remembering what I was here for, I changed my focus to the pyramid. I noticed that there was steps up to a door so I took the stairs up. The doors opened and I walked into what seems like a throne room. In the throne sat a Man with a white beard and somewhat long hair. He was in a toga and was gripping a golden lightning bolt. He was about 15 feet tall and his throne was made out of platinum encrusted with diamonds

“Who the hell are you?” the man asked

“I’m wondering the same thing” I responded

“I’m Zeus, but how in the hell did you get here? My son should’ve killed you.” Zeus questioned

“I walked, and who the fuck is your son” I answered

“My son, He’s a Minor God of lightning, he makes sure no mortals get here. And even then, the monsters must have gotten you” Zeus said

“Well I’m pretty sure it was your dick son who killed my wife” I told Zeus

“It’s been fun talking to you but I have to battle you now, or I could send you straight to the underworld. It would be painless” Zeus responded

I quickly pulled out my gun and unloaded all my bullets from his chest Golden blood oozed from his chest and he let out a roar of anger. The room turned into a coliseum and my gun turned into a bronze long sword. I looked up to see Zeus had gained a sword himself and he was wearing spartan armor. He charged at me so I dove at his feet and he fell over. I jumped up and awkwardly stabbed him in the back of his neck.

We instantly teleported straight back to Zeus’ throne room.

“Who are you working for!” He Roared

“No one, why don’t you just let me go,” I answered. Zeus waved his hand and the Man made of lightning, who was apparently Zeus’ son, came out from the right wall and stood in front of me. He had a golden badge that said “Hello my name is… Derek.”

He punched me hard in the nose and I was knocked out.

I woke up in the middle of a field. I recognized the field to be the same field me and my wife were thrown into. As I was getting up I noticed the ground was severally burned. I walked over to the fence and jumped over. My car was sitting there waiting for me. Getting into the car I looked over to see if my wife was there but she wasn’t. I raced home never stopping once. Once I finally arrived, I hoped out my car and swung open the door to my house.

I walked inside my house. Everything seemed normally, I was relieved. I walked to my fridge to get a beer when I saw a flyer for an alcoholic anonymous meeting. I have never once tough about going to AA, I’m not an alcoholic. I sat down on my couch and turned on the TV. I set my Bud Light down on the coffee table but it bumped something over. I was dumbfounded when I looked down to see the coffee table covered in pill bottles, white powder, and mushrooms. Just then, there was a knock at my door. I went to the door and opened it.

“Is Zach Smitherman home?” a Police officer questioned

“You're talking to him,” I responded

“You are under arrest for the Murder of your wife, Madison Smitherman,” The police officer replied

“What?” I asked as the police officer grabbed me and put handcuffs on me. He led me to the car and put me in the back seat. He sped off to the Police station. I looked out the window at the dark skies over Texas and wondered what happened. I did not murder my wife. Before I knew it, the police officer was leading me into an interrogation room. I sat down and he handcuffed me to the table. He walked out as someone else walked in with a laptop.

“Hello Zach, I am Detective Wilson with the Bryan Police,” He said as he opened the laptop.

“You have to trust me I didn’t do it,” I replied

“You didn’t?” he asked as he spun the laptop around towards me. There was grainy footage of what looked like someone starting a bonfire.

“This is game camera footage of you burning your wife’s body in Colorado County,” the Detective stated

“Holy shit,” I muttered

“We also found the blood-soaked bed sheets in the back of your car, along with bleach, a knife, a gun, gasoline, and a box of matches. So, do you want to just admit you did it already?” He asked. I knew there was no point in fighting. I didn’t do it but that dick Zeus set me up. I’m not crazy. I don’t do drugs. I know what I saw.

“I guess,” I answered.

I signed a confession and a plea deal. I got a life sentence, I was starting to wish Zeus had killed me. I’m writing this on a computer in the Library of the prison. I told the guards that this is a fictional story am working on but it’s not. I’m posting it here to see if anyone has had any similar experiences and if any of y’all know how to deal with this.
