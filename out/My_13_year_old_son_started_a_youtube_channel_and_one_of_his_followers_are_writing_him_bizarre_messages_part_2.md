The house was unnervingly silent—an unnatural kind of silence, like the air itself was holding its breath. Even the old radiator, normally hissing and knocking like an arthritic ghost, had fallen still. I could feel the quiet pressing against my skin, dense and watchful, as if the house knew something I didn’t.

I sat alone at the desk in the basement, the laptop open in front of me, the cursor blinking atop a paused frame of Bonnie’s broken face. It stared back, slack and half-melted, lips torn, jaw twisted—but something about the eyes…

They *moved.*

I scrubbed back through the footage, breath shallow, eyes wide. The scene played again: the dark road, the jerking camera, the hideous reveal. But this time I noticed something new.

In the far corner of the frame—behind her, nestled in the shadows of the roadside trees—there was a flicker. Something *tall.* Something *thin.* Angular and sharp, like a marionette made from fractured bones and glass.

Not human. Not even close.

The video ended in static, and I sat frozen, the afterimage burned behind my eyelids. I blinked the dryness from my eyes and clicked open the drive’s file directory.

One visible file. Just the video.

But I knew Bonnie. She was methodical, paranoid about digital footprints. I ran a scan for hidden files.

One more appeared. A text document. Simple title: **“FOR JASON – DON’T LET HIM OPEN IT.”**

My gut told me to close the folder. I didn’t listen.

The file opened in a cascade of strange poetry, coded messages, and eerie instructions.

Every line deeper, darker—each word a hook digging into something primal inside me.

Then the last entry:

I slammed the laptop shut. The basement lights flickered, a single bulb above me groaning under some invisible pressure.

*Had I opened something?*

Was this drive not a warning—but a doorway?

Upstairs, the house groaned—wood popping like knuckles cracking beneath tension—and then I heard it:

A child’s *giggle*. Gurgling. Wet.

It wasn’t Jason’s laugh.

I sprinted upstairs, heart pounding like a war drum.

His door was open. Light from his screen spilled across the hall in a cold, blue wash. The room was dim except for the glow of static on the monitor.

Jason sat perfectly still. Too still. Like a statue carved from shadow. His mouth moved, whispering something I couldn’t hear.

“Jason?”

He turned slowly, as if his joints didn’t quite remember how to work. His eyes shimmered in the glow—not with light, but with absence. Hollow, void-like.

“I talked to Mommy,” he said, his voice flat. “She’s in the screen. She’s cold.”

I stepped toward him, dread a physical force pressing against my chest. “Buddy… that’s not her.”

“She smells like her,” he murmured. “Like dust and shampoo and the box in the basement.”

Something in the laptop screen rippled. The static stretched like a wound opening. Shapes moved just beneath its surface—shapes not meant for sight.

I reached past him and slammed it shut.

Jason screamed. Not in fear, but *rage*. He clawed at me, fists pounding my chest.

“You trapped her! She was trying to come back!”

“I’m sorry,” I whispered, holding him, holding on even as he kicked and thrashed. “I’m so sorry, Jason.”

Eventually, he broke down in sobs, collapsing against me.

“I miss her, Dad,” he whispered. “I miss her so much.”

“I know,” I said, my voice cracking. “I miss her too. Every day.”

We sat like that in the darkness, tangled in grief, two broken people trying to hold each other together.

Later that night, I went back down to the basement. To the box. To the drive. To whatever I had opened.

Bonnie had always written things down—journals, notebooks, scraps of thoughts. I found them beneath old picture frames, wrapped in a faded scarf that still smelled faintly like her. Her scent was dusty now, faded by time, but still hers.

One journal stood out. Bound in cracked leather. Pages stuffed with chaotic handwriting.

“He came to me in a dream. Not a man, but something wearing a man's grief like a coat. He said Jason would suffer if I didn't listen. I laughed at first. Then he showed me what he meant.”

**July 21st 2020**

“There are rules. Blood is memory. Screens are doors. I thought it was just madness. But I saw him in the corner of the baby monitor. He watches through reflections. Through pain.”

**August 3rd 2020**

“I made a deal. I didn’t mean to. I just wanted Jason to forget the crash. I just wanted him not to hurt. But now… it hurts worse. I see it in him. Something has followed.”

She had tried to protect him. She had opened the door first.

And in my grief, I had thrown it wide open again.

I stared down at her words, trembling. Tears splashed onto the page, warping the ink.

I never helped Jason *carry* the pain. I buried it. Covered it. Masked it with distractions. With screens.

But hurt doesn’t die. It waits.

And sometimes, it finds a face.
