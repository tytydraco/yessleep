The house had gone quiet again. Not peaceful—dead quiet. The kind of silence that rings in your ears. The kind of quiet that tells you something’s hiding just beneath it, breathing softly, waiting to be noticed. I felt powerless to protect my son

Jason barely left his room now. He stopped responding to texts. He’d deleted every app on his phone except the camera. Sometimes I’d see the screen flash from under his door—quick blinks, like he was filming… or someone was filming him.

I knocked once.

Silence.

Again.

“Jase? You okay in there?”

I heard a faint whimper—maybe a laugh. Something not quite human.

When I opened the door, he was sitting in the middle of his room, the walls plastered with printed comments, screenshots, and what looked like… poetry? All from **Bonnies\_revenge**.

In the middle, a phrase repeated over and over in Jason’s handwriting:

“She never left the crash site.”  
“She never left the crash site.”  
“She never left—”

“Jason—what is this?”

He didn’t look up. He was staring into the camera lens of his phone like it was a mirror he couldn’t escape.

“Dad, you don’t get it. She’s in there. In the wires. She’s *stuck.* And I think she’s trying to get *me* to come back.”

“Come back where?”

His voice cracked. “To the moment. The crash. I keep dreaming about it. Only... I'm there now.”

I felt something fracture in my chest.

“I should’ve seen this,” I muttered. “I should’ve stopped this before—”

He finally looked at me. “But you didn’t. You didn’t want to talk about her. You wanted to bury her. And me.”

Those words hurt more than anything the anonymous internet had ever said. Because they were true. And they didn’t come from a stranger. I had thought the best way to shield him from pain was to forget and move on. We just had to put it past us… Or maybe… That’s what I wanted. I never asked Jase how he felt.

That night, I stayed awake in the living room. The TV flicked through static channels by itself. My phone rang twice—no number. When I answered, all I heard was gravel crunching, sounds of collisions and finally... Just a low monotone humming, like an old router.

I don’t sleep much anymore. Not because I don’t want to—but because the house changes at night.

The walls creak in ways they didn’t before, as if the very wood is remembering things better left forgotten. The air thickens, soured with the scent of scorched plastic and something older—like mildew clinging to bones left in the dark too long.

Jason mutters in his sleep. Not words, not really. Fragments. Phrases. Tongues I don’t recognize, strung together in patterns that set my teeth on edge. Things no thirteen-year-old should know. His voice hitches like static through a broken speaker—crackling, glitching, distorting. It’s like he’s become a radio tuned into a signal from somewhere beneath the fabric of reality. Somewhere wrong. A place my wife might have come across, a long, long time ago.

And when he wakes, he looks at me with hollow eyes, like glass marbles staring out from a mask. He says he doesn’t remember. Maybe he truly doesn’t. Or maybe he does, and the silence is his only shield against whatever it is.

Silence has become his native tongue. A language made of grief and digital ash.

One night, alone in the amber hush of the kitchen, I found myself holding Bonnie’s old laptop again. I don’t even remember walking over to it. I just… found myself sitting there, hands hovering above the dusty keyboard, as if guided by something beneath my skin. Guilt, maybe. Hope. Or something darker. Something hungry.

The laptop groaned awake like a corpse stirred by thunder. Its screen flickered, faint and weak, like an eyelid fluttering against death. The desktop was cluttered with fragments of a life cut short—photos, recipes, letters she never sent. But the folder titled ‘Web 1.0 research’’ pulsed. I swear it pulsed like a wound. I opened it once again, this time carefully looking through all the files in there. I found a folder within simply titled:

\#\_ve1l\_of\_flesh\_and\_pain

The name didn’t even register as real. Just static. A shriek translated into text. I clicked it.

Inside was a single link. No description. Just a URL that didn’t belong to any known structure. More like an incantation disguised as code.

I should’ve stopped there.

But I didn’t. I had to know more.

The browser didn’t open it. It yielded to it. The screen bled black, as if ink had poured from within the circuits. Then it formed: a spiral, coiled like a snail shell but made from yellowed teeth and tendons. Each rotation felt like a countdown or a ritual. I stared. It stared back.

I felt watched by something unseen, hidden in the digital realm.

No, I felt more than watched…

It felt like something had reached through the screen and *pierced* me—its gaze slithering into the deepest, dust-choked corners of my mind. It didn’t just *see* my thoughts; it *fed* on them. Every buried resentment, every unspoken regret, every splintered memory I’d tried to forget—it dragged them into the light, one by one, like worms writhing from rotting earth. And then it *nourished* itself on them. I could feel it—this thing—fanning the coals of every hateful, bitter emotion I had ever swallowed. Guilt. Rage. Self-loathing. It didn’t just know my pain. It *amplified* it. Stoked it. Made me *feel* it again. *Worse.* Until I couldn’t tell where I ended, and where the hurt it wanted had begun.

This wasn’t a website. This was a shrine. An altar built from lost memories and the agony of forgotten users. Trapped souls. Trophies?

Text began to pulse:

“This is the house of pain made by flesh and wires... But also hope. Offer despair. Drink demise. Come home. Offer your flesh and your being to the wires. Only then can you know peace from this dreaded existence.”

I tried to close the window. The mouse wouldn’t move. My fingers trembled, stuck in place. The speakers hissed. Quiet at first. Like breath exhaled through metal lungs. Then louder—an avalanche of voices, screaming in binary, in panic, in worship.

A chorus of agony.

The monitor pulsed—like a heartbeat. Faint, then stronger. Faces flickered on the screen, each more grotesque than the last. A man with no mouth and too many teeth. Children whose eyes had been replaced with red LED bulbs, bleeding at the edges. Lips peeled back, eyes sewn shut with wire. Still alive. Still moving.

Then—I saw her.

Bonnie.

Or something wearing her like a mask.

Her skin was torn and re-stitched in jagged lines. Gauze soaked red wrapped around her head like a bridal veil dipped in meat. Her sewn lips twitched, as if trying to mouth my name.

Begging.

I screamed and yanked the power cord.

The screen stayed on.

The spiral spun faster. Her face rippled. A laugh—or something like laughter—poured from the speakers. Then a low, rattling chant in a tongue I couldn’t understand.

But maybe I could… Because words began to form in my mind out of that impossible tongue. Words cutting through all the pain and despair like a lifeline, a promise.

‘’She’s in pain here, without you, only unification can ease your pain.’’

I grabbed a wrench.

Smashed the screen.

Only then, in a flash of sparks and glass, did the monitor finally die.

I fell to my knees. I felt violated… Manipulated… Confused and in agony. All I longed for was to see her face as it used to be. Not broken. Not mangled through blood, flesh, and bones. I had felt the pull towards the screen; how strong it felt. That final promise… Of relief from all the horrors. Of unification. Of the convergence of all things into one. Terrible and beautiful, happiness and torment, all bleeding into one single entity. A place beyond… Hidden in lines of code.

Something had pulled me back. Memories… Of an analogue time. Memories of nature, of roasting marshmallows while fireflies glittered in the dark, playing rough and dirty in the street, scraped knees, strawberry jam on toast in the my grandmothers garden.

And then a terrible realization hit me… Had Jason seen these things? Had he experienced what I just experienced? My mind could barely perceive it, barely withstand it… But a child? How would something like this affect him?
