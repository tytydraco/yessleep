So, I’ve been dealing with dissociative episodes for a few weeks now. That’s what my therapist says, anyway. I sit down on the couch for a few minutes and then when I finally muster the energy to get up and do something, hours have passed. Like I’m stuck in some sort of time vacuum. More often than not I just feel empty, hollowed out. Things that should elicit some kind of emotional reaction are met with a heavy numbness. I told Ana, my therapist, that sometimes it feels like someone else is in control and I’m in the background trying to tell them how to be me. Trying to backseat drive this usurper through my habits and interests and sense of humor, but it’s disjointed and wrong because it’s not actually me it’s someone pretending to be me. 



Like that makes any fucking sense.



But things have been gradually getting worse.



At first we thought that it was maybe some kind of offshoot of a PTSD or dissociative black out. 



Now I’m convinced it’s something else.



I’ve moved back in with my dad, for some context. He’s been helping me out while I get all this figured out. 



The first instance started with me sitting on his couch watching a movie with Fennel, my dads dog. Then I was standing in the middle of the street with my dad holding my face in his hands. Firmly asking me if I could hear him. Fennel pacing at my feet and whining in that high pitched, squeaky way that greyhounds do. 



It felt like that moment you shift from being black out drunk to conscious again. Suddenly you’re awake and everything is too bright and too loud and you don’t know where you are or how you got there and you can’t process what’s happening fast enough so it almost doesn’t seem real. 



The breeze stung at my eyes and nose, made the trees around us rustle and sway against each other. The sky was starting to get dark, I could see the moon even though the sun hadn’t set yet. I could hear music and voices from somewhere further down the mountain. The sound of hard plastic wheels against pavement as the neighbor across the street dragged their trashcan to the end of their driveway. The asphalt was cold even through the fabric of my socks. I only realized I was shivering when I tried to take a deep breath and the whole thing rattled through me. My dad’s hands were warm and rough against my chattering jaw, his hold on me tightening like he saw the exact moment I re-entered my body. The pressure ached on my bruises, but the pain was grounding in a way. 



“Talk to me, sweetheart. Can you talk?” My dad asked, lines between his brows deepening as he scowled, gray eyes shifting restlessly between my own. 



It took several tries to get any sound out, like my brain hadn’t fully reconnected with my body, just useless working of my tongue and jaw before I finally managed to force enough air out to ask, “what happened?” 



I saw relief in his eyes before he let out an exasperated huff of air, tension bleeding from his frame before he said, “I dunno kiddo, was kinda hoping you could tell me that.”



“Everythin’ alright, James?” 



We both turned at the sound of Mr. Fleming’s voice. The older man standing beside his trash can as he watched us with an obviously guarded concern.



“Charlotte? Is that you? I didn’t know you were back-”



I saw it the second our eyes met. The shock. Words dying in his throat as his gaze quickly shifted to my father like he couldn’t quite believe what he was seeing, like he was expecting my dad to explain. 



“All good, Earl. You have a good night,” my father offered cordially, giving an easy smile and wave of his hand that Mr. Fleming did not return, simply standing motionless at the end of his driveway.



“Let’s get you inside. Your lips are turning blue,” my dad sighed as he wrapped an arm around my shoulders to guide me back towards the house, whistling for Fennel to follow. 



He whined, looking up the road a few more times before jogging to walk beside us. 



At first I convinced myself it was just a come down of the “episode”, but I couldn’t shake the feeling. The pit that formed in my stomach. That antsy, awful panic like when you’re in the dark and you’re sure there’s something there with you. A paranoia that made me glance over my shoulder to that spot up the road, along the darkening treeline. Nauseous with the certainty that there was something there watching me that I simply could not see. 



And I had been walking right to it. 



My dad said I must have only been out of the house for 10 minutes at most before he heard Fennel barking and came out after me.



But I couldn’t for the life of me think of where I might have been trying to go, or why I would want to go that way. And every time I spend too much time trying to remember it gives me a fucking migraine so I’ve kind of just given up on regaining any kind of memory. 



Ana tried to assure me that it was likely just anxiety. Said memory loss is frightening and anxiety inducing. Not to mention what happened makes me more prone to paranoia. She doesn’t call it paranoia though, she calls it hypervigilance. She does that a lot, tries to use other words that don’t feel so loaded, maybe it’s to make me feel like I’m not crazy. 



It doesn’t really work.



The next thing that happened was a dream. 



I had a nightmare, which has become the norm when I manage to fall asleep.



But it was different than the dreams so far had been. Which honestly, was kind of a relief. 



I was standing in the middle of the woods. It was night time, and it was dark and hazy. All I could see were the trees directly around me, everything else faded to pitch blackness. It was cold but there was no wind. There was no movement of leaves or grass or anything. There wasn’t even sound except for my own heart beat. 



I think I could have moved if I wanted to, but for some reason I didn’t. I just stood there staring into the darkness. Like I was waiting for something.



Then I heard it, a soft hissing sound, almost like something breathing. I could feel the panic setting in, the cold sweat and clammy palms, but I still didn’t move. Even as the sound grew louder, closer. Close enough for me to realize it wasn’t breathing but whispering. 



There was something *whispering*. 



My chest felt tight, making it harder to breathe, pulling in shorter, sharper gasps of air as I tried to fill my lungs that were failing to keep pace with my heart. I was shaking, muscles trembling like they wanted to escape my skin and still I didn’t move. 



It was close enough I could make out the sounds that I now know clearly weren’t English. Yet somehow it was almost familiar. I felt the hair on my arms stand on end, air catching in my throat until I felt like I was choking as I stared into the darkness and saw it shift. Saw something move.



It was getting louder, closer, I could almost make out a shape of it, saw a flash of what must have been eyes reflecting pale blue in the nonexistent light.



Then I woke up.



It took me too long to realize the darkness I was staring up into was not my bedroom ceiling, but the sky. The glimpses of it I could see through the canopy of trees dotted with pale stars. Still in nothing but a t-shirt and flannel pajama pants that did nothing to ward off the cold. Once more I found myself shivering, my fingers and toes stinging. The broken bones in my pinky and hand throbbing like they’d been re-fractured. 



Grass and dried leaves crunched behind me, hurried heavy footsteps that sent my heart into my throat.



I tried to push myself upright, tried to flee, but an icy numbness had seeped into my bones. Stiff and slow and aching as I tried to force them to move. I scrambled away on my hands, blind with panic. Pale blue eyes in the darkness filling my mind, a shadow against the light, cold hands holding me down and making everything hurt. There were hands holding me down. Arms wrapping around me, trapping me. I was falling, flailing, drowning, I was *dying*.     



“It’s me, Lotte! Jesus, stop! You’re gonna hurt yourself, you gotta stop-” I knew that voice, it broke through my fear like an unexpected warm breeze cutting through the chill, but I knew it was wrong somehow, “-Lotte, sweetheart, can you hear me? I’ve got you, ok? I need you to stop fighting me.” 



“Dad?” My own voice sounded wrong, hoarse and cracking, my throat sore like I had been screaming or crying for hours before he found me. 



“Yeah, baby. It’s me, I got you.” He was holding me curled up in his lap like he used to when I was little, my head tucked under his chin. “Scared the shit out of me. Where the fuck were you going?” 



“I don’t- I don’t know I just- I was dreaming and I thought-” None of it made sense, none of it made any sense.



A part of me felt like I might have still been dreaming but this felt too real. I could feel the throbbing from my hand going up my arm. Could feel pain blooming behind my left eye. The cold still held a firm grip on my extremities. Made everywhere my skin brushed my dad’s clothing feel like it was getting scraped by the thinnest shards of glass. Cooled the tears on my cheeks until it made my face sting. Could hear Fennel’s whiny bark faintly in the distance. Could feel the warmth radiating from my dad’s torso. Could feel his heart beating and the irregular way he was breathing. 



“It’s alright,” he let out a shaky sigh and I realized why his voice sounded wrong, he was crying too. “It doesn’t matter now.” 



Eventually he got me up and brought me inside. Again Fennel was my saving grace. Sat at the back door I’d left open behind me barking and whining until my dad woke up and went after me. 



Only that time Fennel hadn’t followed. 



Hadn’t strayed beyond the reaches of the left on kitchen light. 



Ana again tried to explain it away, some kind sleepwalking or waking nightmare. My brain processing my external surroundings but at the same time projecting my dreams onto them. 



And I was almost convinced. Had calmed down and let enough time pass to start believing that.



Until last night.



I woke up, this time in my room, but I couldn’t move. 



I’ve had sleep paralysis before, it usually happens when I sleep on my back so I try to avoid that. Sure enough, I was staring up at my ceiling. My chest tight and limbs frozen, my heart skipping a few beats. I tried to close my eyes, tried to just breathe and tell myself that it would pass. I just needed to go back to sleep and when I woke up again it would be over.



Then I heard it.



Breathing.



Breathing like there was a person standing in the corner of my room. 



I’m convinced my heart stopped. That kind of all consuming, overwhelming terror ripping through my chest that renders you absolutely helpless. As if I wasn’t already.



I tried to tell myself it was part of the sleep paralysis, that it wasn’t real. That I just needed to keep my eyes closed and wait it out. 



Then the whispering started.



The same whispering I’d heard before in my dream. 



Only this time I knew what it meant. I knew what it wanted.



‘*Look at me.*’



And I still for the life of me cannot figure out why, but I did. Almost like I had been compelled, maybe because I was so startled, but I did. I opened my eyes and saw pale blue staring back at me from the darkness. 



If I could have I would’ve screamed. Instead the sound just gurgled in my throat, suffocating me until I managed to force it the rest of the way out as a wheeze. My paralysis no longer an inconvenience but a death sentence. 



Those eyes were just like they had been in my dream, pupiless and glowing the way dogs do in certain lighting. Nothing but solid blue staring down at me, creeping closer. At the right height to be placed within a person's head, but I couldn’t make out any other features in the dark, not even the shape of their body. 



I felt tears well in my eyes, blinked them away rapidly as they blurred my vision.



There was more whispering but I couldn’t understand it this time. Just felt that icy cold dread unfurl behind my sternum. Forced to watch as they stopped at the side of my bed.



‘*Charlotte*’ 



I was going to be sick. I was going to be sick and die by asphyxiating on my own vomit but I’m certain that would have been a better way to go than whatever this thing wanted from me. 



I didn’t see it move but I felt it. Felt fingers like cold granite wrap around my wrist and draw my arm up. Felt the pressure of its hold ache in my broken hand. 



I wanted to scream, wanted to cry, wanted to plead, but all I could do was wheeze. Rapid and frantic as I watched my arm rise. My heart pounding so loudly in my own ears it was deafening. If that thing was still whispering or breathing I could no longer hear it.



There was an awful, tortuous moment of stillness. Of nothing but my own heartbeat and this thing’s cold grip.



Then there was a flash, a quick glimpse of something catching the light, then pain. 



It burned as it ripped into my forearm. Teeth sinking down and only stopped by the resistance of meeting bone. I felt blood well, warm and thick as it dripped from this thing’s lips and down to the bend of my elbow. Heard the soft, rhythmic dripping of it hitting my floor. Felt its tongue, cold and wet and smooth against my skin.



A light flicked on in the hallway, shining through the tiny crack under my door. I could hear Fennel barking, rasping and frantic. Could hear my dad’s bare feet against the wood floors.



“Lotte?” 



It ripped away, a gasp pulling from me as I felt the flow of blood thicken. Felt the direction of it change, dripping off my fingers as my arm fell limp over the edge of my bed. Saw pale blue eyes staring down at me, somehow knew they were full of rage before my dad swung my bedroom door open.



The room filled with light and I braced, expecting to be met with the reveal of whatever grotesque thing this was. 



But I didn’t even see the eyes retreat, they were just staring down at me one second, and then they were gone. 



Two things then happened in the same moment. My dad flicked the bedroom light on, and I regained control of my body.



I shot up, pushing myself to the edge of my bed, squeezing myself into the corner as a strangled scream tore from me. Like my body had simply been unable to release the action, forced to execute it now that I wasn’t frozen. I was gasping, heaving in an attempt to fill my aching lungs with air. My left hand gripping my right forearm and holding it against my chest, dull pain still throbbing there.



Fennel barked, pushing past my dad and crossing the room in a leap. Landing on the foot of my bed and only settling when he was curled up beside me. 



“It’s just us, you’re alright,” my dad tried to assure me, tried to talk me down the way he usually does when I have a nightmare, crossing the room to stand at the side of my bed. “It was just a dream.”



“There was something there,” I exhaled, eyes shifting to the now empty corner of the room. “I woke up and I couldn’t move and there was something standing there and it bit me-”



“Bit you? Jesus Lotte, what the fuck are you talking about?” My dad’s face creased with confusion, concern, disbelief, briefly turning to look at the empty corner before turning back to face me. 



“Look!” I held my arm out, ready to show him proof and instead felt my own mouth drop open in disbelief. 



There was no blood.



There wasn’t even a scratch, just a red, slightly welted curved line on the top and bottom of my forearm.



My dad reached out, carefully took my wrist and elbow in his hands as he turned my arm over to inspect it.



“You probably hurt yourself in your sleep, brain made up some dream to explain it. That’s what your therapist said last time, right?” My dad asked, looking at me expectantly, liking he was waiting for me to see the rationale in it.



My mouth went dry. I felt dizzy, unsteady, quickly glancing back towards the empty corner of the room. 



“There was- I swear I- how would I have even done that?” I frowned at him, gesturing to the angry red lines I knew would be bruises by the next morning. 



“I don’t know, kid, but it looks more like you pinched it somehow than got bit. I mean there’s no broken skin or individual teeth marks.” My dad rubbed a hand over my forearm before he dropped it.



Sighed and ran a hand over his tired face. 



“Maybe you hit it on your nightstand or your head board, I don’t know. But nothing bit you, Lotte, I promise. Just-” He stood there for a moment, frowning at me and Fennel before he said, “-keep Fennel with you. He seems to know when you’re about to… When something’s about to happen.” 



He bent down, pressed a kiss to my forehead and I felt his stubble scratch at my skin.



“Get some sleep, sweetheart.” 



He at least didn’t flick the lights off before he left. Just headed back down the hall to his room.



Fennel huffed, resting his head on my thigh and looking up at me with round brown eyes. 



I sat there like that for the rest of the night. Just cuddled up with Fennel, trying to convince myself that my dad was right. That it was just a dream, that nothing had actually happened.



It just didn’t make sense. It still doesn’t.



But I was ready to buy in, even just to get back a tiny bit of peace of mind. Was ready to forget the fact that Fennel somehow knew. Fennel somehow always manages to know when something is about to happen, when this thing is about to show up. 



Then, this morning, when I finally got up to let Fennel out, I saw one drop of blood dried on my floor. 



I don’t know what to do. Everyone around me is too biased. They’ll find someway to blame it on my *trauma*. If I tell anyone what’s happening they’re just going to try and rationalize it away, dismiss it as some kind of psychosis or mental break. 



So, that’s why I’m here, posting this. I need help, but I have no idea where to even start or what to do.



I know it sounds crazy, I do. But there’s something after me.
