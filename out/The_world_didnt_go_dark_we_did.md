It happened at 12:00 PM.
Not “around noon,” not “about midday.” No.
Exactly at noon. Every time zone. All at different times. That’s when the world stopped making sense.

I was eating a gas station sandwich in the break room. The lights didn’t flicker. My phone didn’t glitch. There was no siren, no boom, no warning. One second, I was biting into turkey and rubbery lettuce, and the next…

The world was gone.

But not dark, not really. I could still see my phone screen. The little LED on the vending machine still blinked red. My flashlight turned on just fine.
It was everything else that disappeared.

No walls. No floor. No ceiling. Just black. Not “lights off” black. No light. No reflection. No perception. Like someone had scooped out my brain’s ability to recognize the world and left me floating in the glowing corpse of what I used to understand.

I thought I’d gone blind—until I saw the outline of my phone still lit up in my hand. But even that was wrong. I couldn’t see my fingers holding it. Just the glowing rectangle, suspended in the nothing.

Then I heard Angela scream.



Day 1: The Fall

Everyone thought it was just them at first. Then they realized it wasn’t. All over town—hell, all over the world, apparently—people could still see light sources, but not what they touched. You could light a candle, but it didn’t illuminate your room. You could stare at a flashlight, but not what it pointed at. No glow on the walls, no shine in the eyes. You were just a floating light, trying not to trip over invisible furniture and fall into the unknown.

TV still worked. News anchors with candles in front of them reporting mass confusion while trembling. I remember one saying, “the sun rose today like a needle through the eye of the void.”
He said it wasn’t a metaphor. Then he started sobbing.

Planes fell. People crashed. Elevators turned into tombs. Within hours, fires broke out—people trying to light their way with open flame, only to realize that everything is very flammable and they can't tell where anything is.



Day 3: The Whispers Start

The lights started changing.

Not flickering, changing. That LED in my flashlight? It pulsed—softly at first, then like it was breathing.
People online said the glow of their devices looked off. As if something else was behind the light, watching through it. A presence. We started calling them "the silhouettes." Not because we saw them—God no—we just felt them. Standing where the light should’ve fallen, where it didn’t.

Sometimes when you move your flashlight, it catches on something that isn't there. Like it's hitting an outline your eyes can't process but your mind can.



Day 7: No More Mirrors

Mirrors stopped showing the source lights. You’d shine a flashlight into one and… nothing. No reflection. Just black.
Someone on a Discord said he saw himself blink. But he hadn’t blinked. He was holding his eyelids open at the time. Said the “him” in the mirror didn’t match his movements anymore.
And the mirror shouldn't have worked in the first place.

He deleted his account after that.



Day 10: The Children

This part makes me sick.

Some kids—mostly under five—can still see. Not fully, not normally, but they navigate better. Some draw pictures of “people behind the light” or “sun masks.” One kid drew her family’s house, but added a fifth member standing next to her dad. It had no face. No limbs. Just long, ink-drip fingers and light leaking out of its ribs like cracks in porcelain.

She said its name was “Mother Sight.”

Parents started using kids as guides. Then… as shields. Then… well. People get desperate. It’s why we stopped broadcasting locations.



Day 15: They Speak

Not in words. In patterns. Morse-code-like flashes from your LED light that everyone inexplicably understood. Radio static that syncs with the blinking of a screen.
I woke up last night to my flashlight flickering in a rhythm. I swear it said “DON’T MOVE.”
I didn’t.
Something brushed my cheek a moment later. Cold. Damp. Gentle. Like moss soaked in tears.



Today: My Last Entry

I can’t stay here. The light is getting thinner. I don’t know how else to describe it. Like it's bleeding out, getting stretched too far. I’ve seen faces in the glow now. Not human. Not angry either—just curious. Hungry. Familiar.

They know we’re adapting. And I think they don’t like that.

So I’m walking into the black. Just like the others. Maybe I’ll find something beyond this blindness. Or maybe…

Maybe the light never reflected anything. Maybe it just hid what was always there.
