Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/5dFf6pQVtW 

I want to start by apologizing for not replying to the few of you that commented on my first post. I assure you there is a good reason. Right as I hit post the whole park lost power. It was late at night and there was a considerable rain storm outside. I checked the time on my phone, it was 12:03 a.m. 

I am the only ranger that lives here on sight. I have a little cabin just down the trail from the main office building. I’m fairly certain that Phil doesn’t live here but he’s always here before I get up, but I never see his truck after dark. I can’t really blame him. This place isn’t exactly peaceful at night. You’ve got the screams from the old abandoned mine over on the east side, and despite the significant distance between the mine and my little cabin I can still hear them. I usually just keep music or a movie going in my cabin to drown it out. The screams aren’t a guaranteed thing, but they also don’t follow any kind of logic. Some nights it’s there, some nights it’s not. That’s not the only thing either. It seems whatever temporal wasteland this park occupies fosters more activity at night. 

When the power went out my cabin fell into inky silence. No screams that night. My fan, my T.V. and most importantly my fridge all shut off. The sound of the rain driving into the roof would have been relaxing if I didn’t have to do something about the power. My fridge is one thing, and honestly reason enough to go get the power back on, but more importantly the water pumps at the spillway shut off if there’s no power, and I suppose that’s a big deal. 

So out I went into that torrential downpour, armed with a flashlight, I should really get a gun. For whatever reason the generator that runs the whole park isn’t located anywhere near the main buildings. It’s at the very end of a mile long out and back service road at the top of a ridge. It’s still on the West side, thank God, but seriously it’s not easy to find, or get to. The distance is one thing, the rain is another, but the whispers, that was another thing altogether.

I’d heard about the whispers before. I guess Richard had a run in with them a few months back. He was pretty freaked out by them, and I have to admit, in that darkness, vainly attacked by my dim flashlight, and the rain, which soaked up most of that dim light, those whispers were pretty ominous. It’s not like anything intelligible, just vague languageless whispers. I think it comes from the trees, but who knows? I couldn’t focus on those right now, I had to get the power on.

When I finally reached the generator I began troubleshooting, trying to get it back on. I pulled the ripcord hard several times to no avail. Out of gas, of course. Why had I not thought of that before I ran all the way out here. Well, walked. I was told to never run through the park at night. When you take off running your imagination takes off with you and it tends to outrun you. Before you can catch up to it it's already reached out to grab you with big hairy, disturbingly ape-like arms. 

Also, why don’t we keep gas cans in a shed close to the generator? Like wouldn’t that be the obvious thing to have? So I began to walk back. The rain was starting to feel cold, and what was just a rain storm quickly became a thunderstorm. Lightning lit across the sky and a loud crack of thunder shook the earth beneath me. At least the thunder drowned out that whispering. 

Halfway back, my already failing flashlight finally gave out. That was the first time I’d ever been in those woods at night, with no light source to guide me. Usually you can at least see some light from near the office area, or the lodge, but with the power out it was true, natural, unadulterated dark. The only way I could see anything at all was via the periodic lightning flashes. There’s a point on that trail with a good enough gap in the treeline that you can, under normal circumstances, see the lake. Lightning flashed and I looked out towards it. That quick snapshot will always stick with me. That was the first time I saw Ricky. Silhouetted against the night, I saw the creature's long neck sticking out of the water as the beast swam around. He seemed to like the rain, and he did look exactly like the loch ness monster. 

I don’t know why seeing Ricky shook me up so much. I mean I see weird stuff here daily. The whispers I heard that night, Gary the forty foot croc, the talking crows, the squirrel pile, but seeing Ricky, that’s what finally made it all set in, it was like an encounter with a deity, a quiet, unassuming god, who cared nothing of the people who worshipped him, erected his graven image all across the park, and I have to say, I haven't been able to look at those signs, t-shirts, and stuffed animals of Ricky the same after that. 

When I finally made it back up to the rangers station I realized that I had no idea where any gas canisters were, and in the dark, there was really no way I was going to find them. Maybe one night without power wouldn’t be too harmful. No sooner had I decided to give up than I heard those whispers again. This time not inarticulate gibberish. This time they spoke to me. 

“Go back, go back, go back!” 

It was as if a thousand voices whispered at once. I felt dizzy for some reason. The whispers were closing in around me. 

“Run, run, run, run!”

They didn’t have to whisper that twice. I took off back towards the generator. Not really knowing why or what I would do once I got there. Even though the Whispers gave me permission I still felt my imagination overtake me on the road. Strange figures stood just off to the side, crouched behind the trees. I felt their nonexistent eyes watching me from all sides, and I began to get the sense that I was actually being chased. I ran harder, faster, the rain stinging my face. The whispers cheering me on. 

I can’t really explain this, but isn’t that kind of the whole thesis here; when I got back to the generator, there was a gas can there. I really didn’t have time to think about it very long. I filled the generator back up, gave that cord another forty or fifty pulls, and it fired right back up. I saw the lights by the rangers station and the lodge pop on through the woods. The Whispers stopped, and I began to walk back to my cabin.

 I got in, took my rain soaked jacket off, grabbed a towel for my hair, and returned back to my bed.
I grabbed my phone to check the time. It was 12:05.  
I really don’t know how to explain that.

Until next time,

Jimmy
