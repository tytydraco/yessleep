I wasn't always a vengeful ghost. 

I was a normal teenager once, living in a quiet suburb. I had dreams, goals, and ambitions. I was gonna work for Disney, I used to love drawing cartoons and getting up early every Saturday to catch Disney's One Saturday Morning. My first Disney movie? Hercules. It was the first one we saw in theaters, I remember being six years old and watching it on the big screen eating popcorn. It was great. After that, no paper was safe from me. I would grab all the spare paper I could find, like discarded bills or old magazines and doodle on them. I'd go through pens like they were candy. 

I was sixteen years old, when I was murdered on May 16th 2007. 

It was an ordinary day, and then some asshole came in guns blazing. Let me tell you, because holy crap. Daniel Levine, was the kid no one paid attention to, and y'know what? For good reason! He was a nobody! He said he did it because he was bullied, no he wasn't. He had friends, he had a girlfriend, kids said hi to him, in fact he bullied other kids. I remember he would come to school bragging about his hunting trips and making fun of the special ed kids. 

Did you know, he worshipped those guys from '99? Yeah! He did. 

He was also a racist. He once called a girl the N-word, because she turned him down. Who does that? He did that. They also blamed violent video games, for what happened. Let me tell you really quick, why that makes no sense. 

My boyfriend also plays those types of games. COD, Black Ops, all the first person shooter games? He also plays those, and guess what?! He didn't shoot anybody! 

Some people, want to bring up Mental Health, and yeah sure ok. We can do that...but, here's the thing about that. So many are trying to use it as an excuse, and not a reason. 'Oh he couldn't help it, he had mental health problems'. That's not an excuse! And people shouldn't be going easy on him because of it.

They wanna bring up Gun Control, and parents, and internet usage and....I am so tired. I don't care why he did it. I just care that he did. I can't go home anymore. I'm a ghost...literally. I try to talk to my parents, and they can't hear me or see me. My little brother cries, all the time and I don't know what to do except just not go home anymore. 

What aggravates me the most though, is not the fact that everyone blames everything else but him, or that conversations lead to nowhere, or that I can't go home. It's the people romanticizing him. 

You know the ones I'm talking about. 

'oh he would never hurt me, I can change him', 'He would have never shot me, because i'm sooo special', 'we have a bond'

And so much more. 

Just because Daniel, is white, skinny, cis, and has that stupid dark flippy hair. Girls want him. They don't care about me, or the other victims. He's their 'oh so special little meow meow' who can do no wrong'...'he had a tough life'...oh cry me a fucking river. If we as the victims are brought up? It's how we probably bullied him, or we didn't give him a chance. 

Fuck you. 

All of you. 

For giving grace and compassion to my fucking murderer, and not me. 

I was sixteen, I had my whole life ahead of me. Now none of that will ever happen...because of him...but I got him back. Hehehehe I got him. Did you know he shit himself when he died? Yeah...yeah he did haahahahaha. 

I've been dead for so long, and I can't go home...or move on...and he's still alive. They've made books, movies, plays...even a Netflix documentary about him. People write think pieces about him, girls throw themselves at him...it's not fucking fair. 

He was so scared. When he saw me in his cell. 

He thought it was a dream...but I wasn't. 

I don't know how he saw me. But I'm glad he did. 

I killed him. 

The last thing I ever saw was his face...and the last thing he ever saw was mine. 

I thought I would move on. But I didn't. I guess what I'm trying to say is, you all loved him so much. You all paraded him like some folk hero, an underdog standing up for the bullied. You all won't let the memory of what happened go. Every day there's a new podcast episode, a new TikTok...a new edit, a new fan...a new shooting. 

I won't tell you how I did it. All you need to know is, for everyone who thinks about him, for everyone who claims to love him, to feel sorry for him, to show him sympathy, and support. My hate will grow, and it will keep growing....I will find you. 

No matter where you go, no matter how far you are, no matter how long it takes. I'll find you, and I'll kill you. 

You want a fucking killer? Ok. I'll be your killer.
