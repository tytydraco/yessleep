**With the gig worker strike going on in India**, as a gig worker I want to share **two strange delivery experiences** that I went through. Sometimes customers make us do things beyond just picking up and delivering parcels, aprt from ask us to pick up extra items on the side during delivery.  
I don’t believe in God, supernatural powers, or devil-related things. But these experiences were strange — not because of anything paranormal, but because of how people and situations turned out to be.

**1) Amazon**

Amazon has two delivery gig recruitment systems: one through vendors and another through the Flex app. Vendor workers are mostly contractual and expected to show up daily, while Flex workers are freelance-type workers who can choose warehouse stations and book delivery slots whenever they want. There is a lot of internal politics involved. Sometimes Flex workers are deliberately given already-attempted deliveries with low success chances or far and isolated locations for low attempts, which affects our internal ratings. That struggle is another topic.

This incident happened during late deliveries, around **9:30–10 PM**. The location was on the outskirts, a dead-end street — not fully isolated, but quiet. There were a few houses on both sides. Some ladies were chatting outside street, & children were playing. I reached the delivery location, which was a typical **three-floor building.**  
There were no lights turned on in the house, and the cellar was empty with no vehicles parked. I usually avoid calling customers and just deliver directly if possible. I confirmed the address using the house number plate and the address nuber on parcel, then called the customer to confirm. He said it was the correct house and asked me to come to the **first floor** to hand over the parcel.

When I entered the building and opened the gate, I noticed strange staring looks from the ladies and children, but I ignored it. As I climbed the stairs, the entire street suddenly went silent. The ladies stopped talking, and the children stopped playing. There was no power inside the building; only dim light from a nearby streetlight. The stairs were dusty, but I didn’t think much about it.

When I reached the first floor, the balcony was covered with dust and dried leaves. There were no footwear and no signs of anyone living there. Still, like an idiot, I rang the doorbell even though there was no power. I knocked a couple of times. No response. I called the customer again & he was not picking up.  
That’s when I realized it was an empty building.

I came back down the stairs. By then, the ladies who were scattered earlier were standing together in a group, silently staring at me. The children were nowhere to be seen. When I looked at them, they pretended to continue chatting.

I went to my bike to check if anything was stolen from my bag, but all the zips were intact. Out of frustration, I called the customer again. He answered and said I had gone to the wrong house and that his house was a few houses away on the otherside.

As I pushed my bike toward his house, I could still see those ladies staring at me through my side mirror. When I reached the correct house and handed over the parcel, I asked him about the wrong address. He gave me a **weird smirk**. I didn’t think much about it then because I was in a rush.

After that, most of my remaining deliveries on that day were unsuccessful. Around **11 PM**, the warehouse manager called, scolded me for late deliveries, and asked me to return and hand over the parcels.

While riding back to room and thinking about what went wrong and I realized something disturbing: from his house, he could clearly see the abandoned building and what was happening there. He had deliberately sent me inside that house., my body suddenly felt cold. My hands and feet went numb. That was my **last day working with Amazon**.

From that day onward, I stopped having dreams for several nights. Sleep felt strange and empty. A few days later, I developed fever, which I initially thought was normal. But later my health deteriorated with bad headaches and balance issues while walking, especially severe at night. My eyes were red, and my vision appeared yellowish. Eventually, I went back to my hometown and was diagnosed with **typhoid**. The doctor couldn’t clearly explain the balance issues and said it might be due to weakness.

I don’t believe in supernatural or paranormal things.  
But what I felt around that house — the silence, the behavior, the intent of customer still gives me chills.  
That feeling is something I can’t forget.

# 2) Zomato (Popular Food Delivery App in India)

After that, I switched to Zomato. This second incident happened during a late-night delivery.

I reached the customer location and called him. He asked me to look for a **black gate house**, but there was none. I told him there was only a small old brown door entrance at the location. He asked me to enter the building. I got confused — like, *bro, don’t you know your own house?*  
It was a **two-floor old-style building**, which looked restored. There were no signs of people inside. Only the stair lights were on. The customer stayed on the call and asked me to use the lift. I was surprised because it was one of the smallest lifts I have ever seen — barely two people could fit. It was a manual swing door with a grill lift. There were no lights inside the lift, like no one had used it that night.  
  
Using my torch, I entered the lift. The customer asked me to go to the **second floor**. The lift was extremely slow. Through the small rectangular opening in the grill, I could see the first-floor door while going up.

When I reached the second floor, it was a penthouse. There were no lights, but many small green plants in pots, well maintained Garden. I explained this to the customer to confirm if it was the correct place. He asked me to go toward the balcony side near the lift. There were no lights, but some visibility from surrounding ambient light.

There was a large strange door with big ventilation openings on top, through which I could clearly see the ceiling inside the house. There were no lights inside. The door had only handles, no locks on the outside, which felt strange. The customer asked me to ring the bell. I told him there was no bell switch outside. He then asked me to open the door and keep the parcel inside.

As I was about to pull the door, I heard a **lady’s voice in the background** on the call, instructing him to tell me to knock first. I felt suspicious and asked if anyone was inside the house. He didn’t answer directly and again told me to knock. I knocked twice. No response.

On the call, I could hear the lady discussing something with another person. Then another guy took the phone and asked me to take a photo of the door and send it through chat, but there was no option to send photos in the app. They continued discussing among themselves.  
At that point, I felt something was off. I told them I would keep the parcel outside the door, marked it delivered, and disconnected the call.

Although i was in rush the lift was slow, While coming down, in that dark lift. Through the small rectangular opening on lift on the first floor lift door, I could see someone peeking through a door, watching toward the lift. That scared me.  
I came out, started my bike, and out of curiosity looked up toward the terrace. I saw a strange shape looking down at me, which froze me for a second. Later I realized it was just a **plant bush from the penthouse**, but by then I was already shaken and drove away from that area.

Not scary stories, just weird things some times customers made us do in India.
