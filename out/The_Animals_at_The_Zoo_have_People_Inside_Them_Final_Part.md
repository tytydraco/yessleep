My mind is moving a mile a minute. The implications are clear. Someone is impersonating me. 

What horrible things could they be doing under my identity? What awful crimes has my face seen? What atrocities have my hands committed? I can't stand the thought. 

I try to tear the mask apart, but whatever material it's made of is too strong. I try to destroy it over an open flame from the stove, but it doesn't burn either. I think about burying it, but they will likely just dig it up. 

I'm left with little choice. I hold it up in front of me, appraising the detail. The accuracy really is decent. If it's modelled after me, it should fit, right? 

If I wear the suit, no one else can. Nor can they steal it while I'm not looking. It's the only strategy I can think of. The only way to stop anyone else from getting hurt. 

The back of the suit opens with ease, basically unzipping itself. Like it wants me inside of it. An acrid odor of sweat and dead skin immediately wafts from the cavity. It seems our washing machine isn't all that effective. 

I tentatively slide one foot in, and then the other. The oily rubber is slippery and wraps tightly around my legs and stomach. Barely holding back vomit, I pause to collect myself, then venture further in with each hand. I tell myself I'm just putting on a pair of really long gloves. Gloves that are smooth and slimy. Gloves that will soon cover my head and face. 

My breath catches short; the suit isn't flexible enough for me to fully expand my lungs. It only allows for shallow, measured inhalation. As long as I don't panic, I'll be fine. 

All I have left to do is slide on the mask and zip it all closed. The interior folds of the face glisten expectantly; its inverted countenance beckoning my kiss. It must be done. It must. 

So I acquiesce. Surrendering myself to myself. 

For twenty seven days, I am the suit's miserable occupant. Just under the surface, a prisoner alone embraced in the dark. The blanketing blackness I used to seek refuge in is now hell. 

Every night, I wait for Dad to come home, but he doesn't. Nobody does. 

Only ants. Hundreds, thousands, millions of ants. They travel from far and wide, all on a quest to consume the fetid putrescence still lying outside my bedroom door. At least it doesn't look like Dad anymore. 

I must say, I'm envious. Right about now, I’d trade my eye for a feast that size, regardless of what it consisted of. The fridge and pantry have been empty for days. We always kept them so poorly stocked. 

How stupid. I can't believe my past laziness would be my ultimate undoing. 

No, I will not die here. Not like this. Not after all I've been through. The resolve to leave has finally been mustered. 

I stiffly shuffle towards the door, not really knowing what to expect on the other side. 

As it turns out, blindness. Not unlike my prison’s withering dark, the overabundance of light triggers the same hopeless absence of sight. 

As I grow reaccustomed to the garish sun, I squint about my surroundings. I see a figure across the street walking his dog. The dog is a puppet. 

This doesn't phase me, but I do take note that the owner’s skin is perceptibly askew like mine. He doesn’t look at me as I walk by, and I don’t take further interest in him either. We both have our own missions, I suppose. 

I know there's a food court nearby. Many people will be there, but that's the closest source of food. I pass an older couple seated on a bench along the sidewalk. The man is laughing at a story the woman’s recounting. Their voices are animated, but their mouths stay shut and their eyes don't smile. 

The food court is finally in sight. A group of teen girls stand by the entrance, posing for a selfie, all entirely expressionless. Their skin stretches tight yet sags simultaneously. Everyone here is inside a suit of their own. The natural progression of things. 

It doesn’t matter anymore; I just need food. I order a sandwich and sit at a secluded empty table.

I'm honestly quite proud of myself for making it this far. A month ago, I couldn't have been dragged to a place this crowded. I guess the complete lack of verisimilitude here prevents my usual agoraphobic response from triggering. 

As I lift the sandwich to my lips, I realize that my mouth hole won't open. The recent lack of use has caused it to fuse shut. I impatiently fumble with the mask for several minutes, but the lips just won't come apart. I'm going to have to temporarily unzip the suit. It terrifies me to show my real face here, but I must feed myself. 

I steel my courage and reach for the zipper on the back of my head. Nothing. I can't find it. It's gone. I try to keep my composure, but my heart rate is rapidly climbing and it's getting much harder to maintain shallow breathing. In fact, I can barely inhale at all. The suit is getting tighter and tighter. 

Only one thought bounces around my head. The one I've made sure to never think. 

“I am trapped in here, I’m truly trapped in here.” 

The suffocating claustrophobia I've spent weeks suppressing can’t be kept dormant any longer and erupts into pure panic. I lurch out of my chair and scream for help, but it's muffled even to my ears. No one looks up. I frantically grope about my head over and over; pulling out chunks of hair and tearing at my scalp, but the suit's thick fingers provide such little feeling and even less traction. 

My foot catches on my chair and I topple to the ground with a painful thud. I roll under the table, fetally curled, my tears mixing with the suit's foul lubrication. Perhaps I'll drown; that would be a mercy. 

I don't know how, but my blind scrabbling finally succeeds and I find the zipper at the base of my neck. With all my strength, I tear the slit open and unceremoniously slide out onto the floor. The freedom to breathe fully again conjures a quivering cry from my throat like a newborn. Naked and exhausted, I grab my sandwich and stumble to the exit, leaving my infernal mother behind.

I'm tired of fighting. There’s no point in delaying the inevitable. Honestly, whoever wants the curse of looking like me and living my life, they can be my guest. Take this hell from me. My face is yours. 

I drift aimlessly for weeks on the streets. I steal from grocery stores and eat out of the trash. No one stops me. No one sees me. My blessed invisibility has returned. 

As I wander along, I realize where I am. Right across from the zoo. 

Why not? Let's reminisce one last time. For Dad. 

I enter with only one destination in mind. The safari section. Where it all began. Inside the enclosure, I witness the most beautiful scene. A living, breathing, authentic zebra. 

It stands majestically in the sun, light scintillating off its stripes, its body proportioned to perfection. Next to the zebra stands a figure, feeding grain out of his hand. He turns to face the crowd. 

It's him. 

Or more accurately, it's me.

My doppelganger was here the whole time. The zebra gracefully nuzzles his chest. He lovingly strokes its mane. He looks up to me and shows the most genuine smile. 

He waves his hand in acknowledgement, but I know it's not for me. It's for Andy, who appears from behind me and happily waves back. He wears no mask; Andy’s smile is real. 

The two join in the enclosure, and they embrace. I walk away in silence. 

Did I ever really take off the suit? I can't remember. Maybe I'm still wearing it. Maybe I've always worn it, and I'm someone else entirely who has simply forgotten who he is underneath. 

Perhaps the one feeding the zebra is the real me. Or at least, he deserves to be. 

He brings joy to others. He uses his face for smiles and laughter. 

The old me never did that. The old me never existed, not really. 

My life hasn't been stolen; I never had one. 

My image hasn't been taken; it's been transfigured. 

I'm finally something that matters. 

Something beautiful. 

Something pure. 

I've never been happier.
