I looked back at the clean walls and wonder why the last family had left this place in a haste. 

It was literally luxury or at least it looked the part of luxury. I'm pretty sure this is just about as bougie as places get in a hood like this. 

Loud rap music blaring from four different directions outside of my front door, and a drug deal or two occurring simultaneously under two different sets of stairs. 

This house was definitely a beauty for what I pay per month. 

Hopefully none of my new neighbors stopped to say hi. It wasn't that I didn't like them, I was just not interested in being apart of anything. 

This place was perfect for a shut in like me. I could care less about the outside world, just as long as my home was safe. 

I walked in and immediately closed every curtain.

 Great!

 The local home warehouse store had already set up my new refrigerator I began placing my groceries in neatly. 

I took out all of the nuts I had and put them neatly into each jar with their names attached. I did the same to my raisins, grains. I grabbed my stacks of noodles and got to business unwrapping each of them and putting them into their own jar. 

I heard a shuffling sound. I stopped and looked back near the bathroom where the noise had originated. 

No movement.

Whatever that noise was, it could wait. I still had at least 10 hours worth of food to put away and some of the food had spoil maturity at 5 hours. So I had to rush that. 

It was when I was 3 hours in putting away the nicely sliced pineapple pieces. That I saw something dart from one room to another at the corner of my eye. 

I stopped what I was doing and let the pineapple pieces fall from my grip into the jar in the fridge. I stared, blinking like a maniac for a few moments at the dark open doors. 

Then I realized something more important but it should've been immediately obvious. Dark open doors. 

I slowly got up and stared at the window on the opposite wall. It was night already. Crap. 

I grabbed my phone and looked at my timer, I had 40 minutes left until it rang. It had already been 4 hours almost. 

I cracked my back moaning loudly and yawning all at the same time. 

It was times like these that made me feel like an old geezer, even though I was only 22 years old. 

At least most of my jars were put away neatly stacked on top of each other in the fridge, the other ones would have to go into the deep freezer. 

I walked over to it getting a weird chill up my spine. 

I looked back instinctively to see a gun raised at me. WOAH! when had that gotten there. Then the gun started moving as the person slowly revealed themself walking from the shadows. 

"Oh, Hi?" I said conversationly.

"Where's the money?" 
Said the angry, very built for business woman holding a gun that was pointed at my stomach. 

I looked at her and raised an eyebrow. Then I let out a loud Ha! "You making a funny?" 

She snarled clearly not seeing any funny. I continued smiling because why in god's grace would she think I would have money. 

"Look around and when you find money tell me. Or could you at least tell the money to call me sometimes it would definitely help a whole lot."

She snarled again "This isn't a joke, give me your valuables."

I laughed a loud Ha! Again except this time it surprised me too. "Sorry"  I said looking at her she straightened her gun. 

I looked down awkwardly "you could take whatever you'd like, honestly, I wouldn't mind." 

She slowly lowered her weapon "What's wrong with you? Most people literally pee their pants at the sight of a gun yet you don't seem-" before she could finish robbing me we both turned to the sound of a loud 'THWAP' something had fallen, super loudly. 

"Wha-" "huh" we both said. Now we both looked back at each other and then back to where the noise had come from in the bathroom. 

She pointed her gun that way, at least it wasn't at me anymore and then I let her lead the way. I followed behind feeling like a little chicken. 

I whispered to her "I haven't even started moving in officially I don't know what could be making noise in there." 

She glanced back at me anger still on her face. We both cautiously walked to the side of the empty bathroom. 

Then boom with a swoosh me and her turned the corner like trained army veterans.

Ok, the bathroom was supposed to be empty. That was until a projectile complimentary soap came flying right into my forehead. I felt it connect and made a loud pathetic "EHH!" noise. I quickly rubbed at my now stinging head, but that wasn't the main thing in the room.

The thing taking my attention and I'm pretty sure the very angry woman's too was the teenage looking boy tossing the soaps at the wall like he was bored and needed something to do with his hands.

I made that weird "EHH!" noise again at the sight and quickly wished the sound would disappear from my apparent vocabulary.

I heard the woman take in a large gasp before letting it go. "A kid?" She said like she thought it was going to be another robber.

"What? We're you scared your competition was also trying to rob this place too?" 

The kid finally looked over at us with a grace of uncaring I didn't know was possible quite yet. 

"What are you losers looking at?" 

Huh "Excuse me? This is my house.." I said exasperated. 

These two can't just come into 'MY' place expecting 'ME' not to care. 

Then the kid froze up with a look of shock on his face. "Y-You, you can see me?" He looked shocked, far cry from that uncaring grace he had before.

Me and the woman both stared at him a bit longer before we looked at each other confused and then back at him again. 

"Yes." We both said though mines came out a lot more annoyed sounding. 

"What? Did you think you were wearing camo?" I said trying for a joke. I could tell it fell flat on its face since they both had differing facial expressions but non of them read of laughter. 

I dropped my chin a little sulking. Well I thought I was pretty funny. 

"Whatever this is between you and your son, I don't care, I'm not done robbing you." 

I gasped "SON!" 
Then I pointed at him "That kid is not mines." 

She rolled her eyes "I don't care if you don't want to pay child support either." 

She walked off to probably go continue her robbing of my belongings. 

I sighed and then slowly dropped my pointing finger. Only to see the craziest smile of insanity on the teens face I'd ever seen on another human. 

"Hey, there buddy?" I said as if I were talking to a scared stray dog. 

"I'm not exactly sure what you're doing or how you got into my house. I just know I'm gonna have to ask you to leave." 

His smile of crazy stayed perfectly in place. Well this is weird. 

"You can see me..." He says again but this time it sounds darker. 

I shake my head at him like he was being stupid. "Obviously, like I said no camo, also are you here to rob me too?" 

I heard jars being moved and looked back at the woman taking stacks of my fruits jars. 

"Hey weird guy, and son.. I'm gonna... get going, I got business plans with another family, soon, ok." 

I fake smiled back at her trying to hide my obvious anger. 

"Great, hope that family you rob next on your itinerary, is more fortunate then me." I say waving her off. 

She looks at me and then just proceeds to walk right out the front door holding a few of my jars.

I look back only to see the teen now all up in my grill, smiling all insane like. 

I scream again like a man "EHH!" 

The boy starts to laugh, he better not have been laughing at me. 

"Wow that's some manly scream you got there." 

I rolled my eyes, "Well stop freaking me out and get out of my house, already."

"No," he said matter of factly. 

I raised an eyebrow "No?" 

He shook his head like now he thought I was dumb. 

"But this is my house." 

"So? And?" I sighed teens are so sassy and for no reason too. 

"I'm calling the cops." I said already fast dialing them. 

"Sure go ahead." Said the still smiling kid. 

I wrinkled my forehead "Hello, this is a 911 operator speaking?" 

"Yes, hello, I just moved into 'my address' and I was wondering if you could tell some cops to stop by mines there's been a robbery and a kid is here for some reason."

"Yes, I'll be sure to do that." Said the woman on the other side of the line. 

I heard some tapping on the phone and just listened while I watched the kid and his still stupid smiling face. He mouthed the words 'You'll see'. To me making me raise another eyebrow. 

It took 40 minutes before I heard the sirens and a knock at my door. I had gotten so bored I'd went back to fixing my jars into the fridge neatly. 

I opened the door annoyed and quickly hung up on the 911 operator. "Hello" said the man in the cop uniform. 

"Hey" I let him in, he stared down at all of my jars sitting by the fridge and deep freezer. 

"He's in here." 

The cop looked back at me and we walked to the bathroom. 

"Come here" I said to the teen, he got down off of my counter and walked over standing in front of me and the cop. 

"See? Who's kid is this?" I said annoyed pointing at the side of the teens head. 

The cop looked at me and then back to the boy and then back to me. 

"What, kid?" Said the cop looking at me now like I had grown a second head. 

"Wha-hu wha" I said probably sounding like a very weird and lost old man.

"THIS KID!" I said even more annoyed now. 

"There's no kid in here, your pointing at nothing." 

What?
I looked over to the still smiling boy.

Then the cop looked past us into the bathroom. "Unless you mean that mirror over there?" He was pointing at the direction my finger was pointing towards. Huh, I thought.

"Told you, moron" said the teen grinning. 

I looked between the two, if there was no one in the room besides me and the cop I probably looked like a crazy person. 

To save myself a trip to a mental facility, I told him it was probably a false alarm and that the woman who had broken in earlier had scared the daylights out of me so much so that I was paranoid now. 

When he left he looked back to my giant amounts of jars on the floor "Yeah, paranoid for sure" he said smiling at me like he was joking. I didn't find this funny. 

I probably just became a inside joke to his department. I sat down glumly. After the cop had left.

"What's got you acting like a sad romcom." 

Said the see through boy. "Why couldn't he see you?" 

The boy's smile disappeared and was replaced with annoyance. "There's no way you're this stupid?" Said the kid. 

I looked at him with nothing but confusion than I saw realization hit him "oh, you are." He said beginning to laugh. 

Whoever's kid this was, he was very mean, and insulting. 

I sulked some more. 
"I thought paranoid people like you were smart.. I'm a ghost." 

I felt my eyes grow wider. A what now. "A ghost?" 

He laughed some more clapping and slapping things one of which included the chair. It went on for longer than what was appropriate that's how I knew he was just doing it to be mean. 

"Ok, I'm dead, a ghost, a boo." 

"How?" 
 I said looking back at him. 

"He stopped laughing and frowned at the question. "Shut your face."

I nodded, "I'm not paranoid, I'm just neat." I said feeling slightly defensive.

He looked over to the jars "you don't say." 

"Well I don't." 

"What?" He asked.

I looked at him blankly "I don't say." He rolled his eyes.

Then I got the heebie-jeebies that I was supposed to get. I remember back to his terrifying smile from earlier and fear slowly crept in. 

This teen was a ghost, a spirit, whatever else words you can use to describe it. A boo as he called it.

"Do I spook you." 
"No,"  I said defensive again but now I wasn't really sure.
