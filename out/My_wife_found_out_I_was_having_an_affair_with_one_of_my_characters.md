I’m a writer. Not a good one but good enough to write a character I fell for and started an affair with.

Her name was Thelma Baker.

She was ordinary, and I made her increasingly ordinary as I felt myself being drawn to her, but it didn't help. Maybe her ordinariness is what attracted me to her in the first place. On some nights, I just couldn’t write anyone else.

Then my wife found out. I don’t know how. Maybe it was the way I’d phrased the character notes, or my expression while typing away at the laptop.

She demanded I stop writing Thelma Baker.

“No,” I said.

She wasn’t pleased, but what could she do? I can write anywhere—on anything. If I want to write Thelma Baker, I’ll damn well write Thelma Baker. Besides, how could I let Thelma Baker down like that? She’d been so lonely.

I cherished our writing times together.

A few weeks later my wife emailed me a link to a Google Docs file.

“What’s that?” I asked, opening it.

“My autobiography,” she yelled back from the kitchen, and just as I scanned to the end of the document, I saw:

*‘My autobiography,’ I yelled back at him from the kitchen.*

My wife was logged in, editing the document.

I saw her type:

*He scratched his head like an imbecile and stared with disbelief at his laptop screen, then thought, ‘What the fuck?’*

I scratched my head. What the fuck?

**WHAT THE FUCK!?**

*As I walked to the living room, he browsed to his stupid little writing folder and opened up the latest half-assed chapter of his idiotic book.*

I stared at the document—my document—and felt compelled to write

*a scene in which his favourite fictional slut Thelma Baker fucks the entire New Zork City police force, and loves it!*

‘“Oh, yes. Yes! Give it to me, boys!” Thelma Baker screamed in orgiastic ecstasy,’ I wrote, unable not to write it. ‘And she gave it to them good, reminding them how much better at sex they were than Norman Crane.’

Oh—no…

*The poor schmuck couldn’t comprehend that he’d been reduced to a character in his brilliant wife’s autobiography. The words* you are what you love *played over and over in his head. Then*

I wrote, ‘Thelma Baker ascended the police station stairs in the desperate realization that she’d been hoodwinked by a two-bit swindler with a small cock who didn’t know how good he had it with his wife. Once she reached the roof, there was nothing for her to do but—

“No!” I yelled,

*but I merely laughed at his misery.*

—slit her throat with the very knife author-loverboy had given her in chapter-whatever and, with her last bits of strength, threw herself over the edge.’

*SPLAT!*

*No more Thelma Baker.*

I started weeping, wailing

*, like a young child whose favourite toy had been taken away. He was pathetic.*

‘The End,’ I wrote,

understanding that I was now faithfully

*mine*

helplessly forever.

That was then.

This is now: her mind has degraded. She suffers increasingly from dementia. Perhaps worse. Sometimes, she forgets about her autobiography for hours at a time, forgets who she is and who I am; and in those blessed hours, I am free.

For years, I have plotted—to finally put my plan into action:

Together, we sat beside her computer. *Her blank unknowing eyes.* She opened the latest volume of her autobiography (muscle memory!) and I whispered in her ear: “Until, one day, my husband began writing his own autobiography. For the first time in decades, he wrote.”

And she wrote it.

How quickly I ran to my own computer! (My legs themselves propelled me.)

Created a new document.

‘My name is Norman Crane,’ I typed. ‘I am a writer. I have a wife. She smiled at me.’

And—would you believe?—beside me, the dumb sow smiled.

*Genuinely.*

And thus I knew the day of reckoning was truly upon me.

For I, a mere character in my wife's autobiography (a voluminous and humiliating history of my own involuntary submission to her), had managed to create, within that autobiography, a second autobiography: mine—autobiography within autobiography, world within world—and within that, my wife became a character of my own invention and (I hoped) manipulation! Even as I remained a character to her, she was now simultaneously a character to me. *Spin, heads, spin!*

The ramifications, possibilities and paradoxes hurtled past, as I pondered the exact manner of my long-awaited vengeance.

I didn't know how long she would remain out-of-it, absent, staring *through* her computer screen, pliant and vulnerable as a plant, but with every passing second, even as I felt my wrath grow, I also felt something else, something wholly unexpected—and so, of my own free will, I typed:

‘Although for long she had been afflicted by the ravages of old age, today—for reasons inexplicable to medicine or science—she was cured. Sharpness and clarity returned to her mind, and never again did she suffer from dementia or any other serious ailment.’

And when I looked at her, she was herself again.

My fingers slipped from their keys.

“Norman,” she said sweetly, “—what the fuck are you doing messing with my autobiography!”

She hit me, and I…

*I loved her.*

“You're going to get punished for this! Thought you could take advantage of me in my state!” she screamed, then glanced at her screen, muttered, “Oh, no you don't!” and backspaced the lines about my autobiography—

the haze returned to her eyes, she slumped in her chair.

And so I am, *cursed by my love for her [itself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane)*
