I have been working as a dentist receptionist 
 for 2 years now and it's been quite the ride.
 When I first started here I kept to myself I don't make friends easily so that left the outcome of me being alone at work almost every lunch break since I started here. The building where I work at is very crowded it's surrounded by a few shops that forms a U shape , a apartment complex with a Honchos take away resturant to the side and last but not least a car shop at the back with a alleyway filled with sewage water and oil, so not many wind or sun can come through windows from the back to the front leaving the work environment eerily cold even on summer days. I've noticed odd  things happening whenever I am alone at first I thought it might be my imagination or stress, but the more I spend time alone here the more I realized it was infact not my imagination running wild. 

When my coworkers go out to get lunch I stay behind catching up on some work or I practice my drawings. At first there were only noises like footsteps and doors opening and closing  do note that all the doors are locked except for the staff bathroom, the surgery room and the sterilization room  when I went to back to investigate I come across locked doors and not a person insight so my only plan of action was to ignore it and I did a pretty decent job until now. I had asked my coworker about the strange noices and she said that yes it does happen all the people that used to work here has mentioned it before and it only happened when you are alone so yet again the only answer was to ignore whatever it was.

 However things had gotten alot weirder I live in south africa and we have something called loadshedding it is a term used where our power supply company decides that it's time to switch off our power to save electricity but it causes more harm then good on that particular day we had just gotten our loadshedding and like I said there's no window's in the back except for the surgery and the bathroom, but with the buildings surrounding us and the alleyway behind it makes it kinda impossible for us to open the window in  the surgery without getting a strong smell that makes us want to puke our guts out so we close it for our own sanity leaving only the bathroom window open.

I had too much water to drink so I had to go to the bathroom I told my coworker to watch the front for me incase we get a patient or the phone rings. As I got to the bathroom closing the door something tried pushing it open with force at first I thought it was my coworker playing a prank cause they know I am afraid of the dark, but when I glanced through the opening I saw no one but endless darkness, my heart started beathing faster and I received chills all over my body the first thing I did was yell out " Not today buddy not today" and pushed the door shut locking it as I did so.

 I did my buisness while I was still in shock waited a few minutes before darting out to get myself where light is, I told my coworker what happened and she replied it might be the wind cause it was windy outside however the wind wouldn't push open the door from the opposite side where there's no wind nor windows and like I said before we don't get much wind or light back there and the question that lingers in my head incase it was just the "wind" why didn't it happen before ? cause we do get strong winds like this but it never made me fight with a door to close it. 

Today was the last straw hence why I am writing this to tell someone about it without them thinking I am crazy. My coworkers had just left leaving me on my own to do some work I couldn't do before because of  loadshedding. My desk is quite a bit on the tall side and with me being short I cannot see over it when I sit down and people don't see me unless I stand up. So while I was busy with work the front door opened and closed thinking it might be a patient I looked up  seeing no-one I shook my head and continued what I was doing when it happened again.

 "alright that might be the wind" I thought ignoring it for the second time that's when things took a turn the phone rang and I answered it only hearing heaving breathing fron the other line I wanted to disconnect it. Just as I was I about to disconnect it the door opened stayed open for a good 10 seconds then it shutted closed with so much force that the whole front door rattled startled by both the phone call and the door I stood up and that's when a loud scream from the phone made it's way through the building I dropped the phone on the desk and fell to my knees holding my hands against my ears it felt like it was about to explode. when the screaming noices stopped I slowly pulled myself up feeling dizzy and disoriented I glanced at the mirror above the desk I had blood dripping from my ears the call disconnected people walking outside like normal they didn't hear what I just heard I closed my eyes for a split second allowing myself to drift into darkness...

 I am currently at home still shaken by the experience I just got off the phone with my boss I had to take a few days off I think the stress of the past few days has gotten to me...
