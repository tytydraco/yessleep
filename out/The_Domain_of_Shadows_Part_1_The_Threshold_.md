[Part 2:](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/WVNMtpzFCk) 

Ethan had been acquainted with the darker corners of the internet. An afternoon university student and a good coder, by night he was an adventurer, deep-diving into forums, chat rooms, and the invisible parts of the web. For him, the dark web was not some hangout for criminals and black markets but a source of forbidden knowledge.

And so, that night, browsing through the threads of a certain dark web forum, he came across a thread simply entitled "The Shadow's Domain." Whatever the post was, it was cryptic; in fragmented sentences, it was very full of warnings:

"Do NOT enter unless you seek the truth. This is not a game. This is not a joke. Access only if you are willing to pay the price."

Ethan's heart raced as he scrolled through the comments. Most of them had come from users claiming that they had accessed the site, yet wished they hadn't. Some were claiming they were being haunted by voices while others spoke about shadowy figures now lingering within their homes. Several of the comments merely read, "Don't".

A link was there at the bottom, over Tor. Ethan Highlighted it into his clipboard; for a moment, he hovered over paste in browser, and then commitment: A black screen, then blood-red letters materialized:

"Welcome to The Shadow's Domain. Proceed?"

The cursor was blinking at him expectantly. Ethan's fingers hovered over the keyboard. The weight of the decision pressed upon him. Curiosity won out-as always. He typed "Yes."

The screen flickered. A voice, distorted, emerged from his speakers, whispering in a language he didn't know. The text on the screen changed, depicting a series of symbols and some sort of ominous countdown timer. Beneath it, a message read:

"To continue, you must invite the Shadows into your space. Turn off your lights and acknowledge their presence aloud."

Ethan laughed nervously. It had to be some kind of crazy prank. But his room was already in near darkness, and the adrenaline coursing through his veins made him play along. He reached over to his desk lamp and clicked it off.

The room plunged into darkness, save for the pale glow of his laptop screen. Ethan cleared his throat and muttered, "I acknowledge your presence.

For a second, nothing happened. Then, the temperature in his room plunged and his breath emerged in great, visible puffs; the hairs on his arms were standing on end. A soft hum filled his room-a hum that sounded like whispers laid over static.

The website reloaded itself, flashing up a live feed of his bedroom. Ethan froze.

"What the hell?" he whispered.

The feed was from an angle above him, but Ethan didn't own a webcam. He looked around the room, panic setting in. The whispers grew loud enough now to form coherent words.

"You invited us."

 

Ethan's gaze snapped back to the screen. On the feed now, he saw a dark figure looming behind him-twisted into impossible shapes. He spun around; nobody was there.

Whispers gave way to jeering laughter. On the screen, a single line typed itself in:

 

"This is only the beginning."

 

There was a knock on his bedroom door.
