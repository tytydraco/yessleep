I don't really know what to do in these kinds of situations so I'm writing this to get things off my chest, and to potentially help people who might unknowingly cross this town. I don't know what else to say to be honest, my mind is still in a bit of shock, so I'll just get straight to it.

I live in a fairly small and secluded town in the outskirts of New Jersey, where everyone practically knew everyone. The town was surrounded by woods in all directions other than the bridge that connects this hell into the rest of civilization. Looking back on it, all of this started happening when I was still young.

I have two childhood best friends. Or at least, I had two childhood best friends. One is a fairly tall and skinny guy that looks more like an oversized fig than a human; let's call him Zack. The other one is a short, red haired girl named Kimmy, who was manlier than me and Zack, combined most of the time. The three of us were known as the trouble seeking brats of the town. Rightfully so, as every night at exactly 11:00 PM we would sneak out of our houses to visit abandoned sites near our area and come home before sunrise. Most of the time there wouldn't even be anything slightly interesting. Those kinds of nights we would just scare each other with the scariest stories our little brain could come up with and goof off the rest of the boring night hours. But this night was different.

After sneaking out with little to no effort, we met at our usual meet up spot in a park near the church. We've ran out of abandoned places to visit  tonight so it was bound to be a boring night I thought. But Kimmy had other plans. 

"What if we go to the abandoned construction site not far from here? You know, the one that was supposed to be the third mansion of the Sander's?" Suggests Kimmy.

The Sanders are the people that started the town. They run most of the businesses and politics here among many other. Anyways, before I could speak Zack had already agreed to go. Not wanting to be left behind, I decided to join in.
Kimmy wasn't lying when she said it's not far, but the entrance sure wasn't what I was expecting. Kimmy brought us to a fenced area just before the woods. Me and Zack were confused at first, but Kimmy crouched down and opened up a cut-out part of the fence just big enough to barely be able to squeeze us in. Kimmy went first. Reluctantly, me and Zack followed suit. The trail was in the middle of the woods but not far from where we entered. Walking just a few miles in, we saw it.
A towering mansion with a yellowish white color presumably from decay, stands in front of us three little brats. It felt like we would be crushed to the bone if we even moved a muscle. The mansion is obviously beginning to be claimed by nature as well, but it still surprisingly stood tall. It looked to be about four stories high, and it had a huge gaping hole at the side of it where the mostly unfinished parts of the mansion, and some big chunks of broken concrete and rubble was.

Seeing the unfinished mansion in the middle of the forest was a sight to see. It was like a star gleaming bright amidst the dark void. It was captivating to say the least. And as to illustrate my point, Kimmy and Zack both let out an amused inhale followed by a short and subtle "woah".
It was certainly a dream come true to see such a treasure in the middle of the forest for us "abandoned places nerds", if not for one thing.

Something felt horribly off.

Not trying to be a subject of another long and painful teasing, I didn't say anything. Looking back, Zack and Kimmy probably felt and thought the same. Not having said a word to each other, we both went in from the front door to the mansion. The door let out a long and deafening creak as it shook violently whilst opening. It low-key looks like a whole horror movie scenario.
I could tell the three of us were already scared shitless, but we moved on. We pulled out our crank-flashlights, separated, and began searching from room to room for anything interesting.

We would occasionally shout to each other to let the other know where we were. We did this from time to time, until there was silence. I couldn't hear them both move, or shout their name and location. This eerie silence went for what felt like an eternity, until I decided to break the void.

"ZACK! KIMMY! YOU THERE!?" I shouted. 

No response. I did it again and again but never once got a response. I started searching for them in every room and every floor I could go but I didn't find any traces of them. Silence pierced my ears as I'm beginning to feel the weight of the situation. I started to tear up. As one final call I shouted-

"ZACK! KIM-"

My shout was interrupted by a sharp loud scream in the other room. It sounded like Kimmy! I rushed to find where she is, but instead I saw Zack at the doorway of the living room, his back facing me.

"Zack?" I asked.

He didn't look back, as if to not look away from something. I squeezed between Zack and the doorframe and looked towards what Zack was looking at. I saw Kimmy laying down on the ground as if she was covering herself from something. A look of pure terror and speechlessness took over her whole face whilst looking over the room. 

I finally put my eyes on what Zack and Kimmy were looking at, and saw over a dozen dead, corroding bodies, standing firm and looking at us with more life and glee than we had at that moment.

It's getting late now, so I might just end it off here, if I'm lucky, I'd be able to write another entry. Sorry to end the story so abruptly but, if I'm being honest I'm still not over Zack and Kimmy. I miss them both so much that I could die. Goodnight.
