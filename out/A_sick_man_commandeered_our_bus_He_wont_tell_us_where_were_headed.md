"We haven't stopped in awhile," said the woman across the aisle.

She'd never said a word to me before.

It's funny how that works. We shared this commute through the city every morning, and all I knew about her was that she liked paperback thrillers and wore a mauve peacoat when it was chilly out. We even got off at the same stop. I always headed left towards the shopping district while she disappeared into one of the corporate office buildings across the plaza.

I looked up from the word puzzle on my phone, startled. "Pardon?"

She took off her sunglasses, her dark eyes fixed on mine.

"Why haven't we stopped yet?" I looked down at my word search. I'd completed three entire rounds. Usually I barely got through the first before our stop.

Glancing up at the destination sign did nothing to calm my rising confusion. It flickered on and off, displaying North Fifth Street and Winston Ave interchangeably.

"I don't know," I admitted. "Weird." The woman snapped her novel shut and stood up with a huff, gripping the guard rails and weaving between other commuters as she made her way to the driver. He didn't turn around.

"Sir," she said, raising her voice over the shuddering of the bus. "You missed our stop. I have a meeting with a client that I can't be late for. Can you hear me?"

The driver said nothing. The woman stood there, arms folded, then dug her phone out of her coat pocket.

"This is ridiculous," she said. "I'm reporting this to your company." I'd thought it was a bit of an overreaction at the time. I returned to my mobile games.

I heard her wait on hold, transfer to another line, wait on hold some more, then finally lodge a complaint with the bus company. All the while, we still hadn't stopped. I noticed that other passengers were beginning to look uncomfortable and irritated as well. A couple of teens in school uniforms were huddled together in the back corner, whispering. The young mom bouncing her baby on her knee began to glance out the window, her brow furrowed. An older balding gentleman near the front tapped his cane against his seat impatiently, then stood up.

"Listen to the lady, gosh darn it," he shouted up to the driver. "We've all got places to be!"

I didn't know if that was true. I wasn't exactly yearning to get back to boxing to-go orders at the noodle place downtown during lunch hour. If anything this odd little diversion from my routine was a good excuse for a much needed break. Plus, it would make for a good story to tell to the guys at the shop tomorrow.

When the driver still remained silent, the old man made his way to the front.

"Alright, what's the big idea?" he said. "Look at me!" he grabbed the driver's shoulder and tugged.

At this point, the driver turned around. His face was pale, almost slimy. He looked ill, his eye sockets sunken. His hair was long and greasy, hanging in strips that fell into his glassy eyes.

He gave a wet choke that sounded like a curse, spitting up dark blood onto the old man's face.

Then, the driver fell into the aisle with a thud, narrowly missing mauve peacoat woman, who had just hung up on the bus company. He lay there with open, empty eyes. Dead.

Pandemonium broke lose. Everyone was screaming. The high schoolers pulled out their phones to document the situation. A businessman by the doors heaved like he might vomit. The baby started wailing. Some people shuffled out of their seats while others pulled their legs in, desperate to get as far from the body as possible. The bus gave a sickening lurch, throwing everyone off-balance.

I felt my breakfast rise in my throat and swallowed, heart hammering in my chest.

In the midst of the chaos, the woman in the peacoat stepped around the body, clutching the guard rails. If she was as terrified as I and everyone else on the bus was, she didn't show it. She looked around with narrowed eyes.

I approached her. She noticed and ran to meet me in the middle, heels clicking down the blood-spattered aisle.

"What do we do?" I asked breathlessly. She seemed to be the only one not actively losing their mind to hysteria. I trusted her judgement more than my own.

"Who's steering?" she barked.

She was right. Somehow, we hadn't crashed yet. I paused, standing up straight. The bus was now rolling down a smooth path while its passengers braced for a collision which that would never come.

I looked out the window. Outside, the city blocks had given way to wider roads. I saw an exit sign coming up ahead.

Simultaneously, the woman and I looked up towards the driver's seat. It was mostly obscured by the panicking crowd. We crept our way back up the aisle, avoiding the body.

Someone was sitting in the driver's seat. I went up ahead to see who it was.

The old man with the cane was steering the bus now, humming to himself. I was both relieved and perplexed. He looked over at me with a smile, his face still flecked with the dead driver's blood.

"You look like a responsible young man," he said. "Take over, will you?"

"I can't." I had never operated a bus in my life.

The old man jumped out of the seat and scurried off.

I dove into the driver's seat and grabbed the steering wheel, panicking as the bus lurched once more.

I fumbled and got it under control, taking all of my will and concentration to keep the massive vehicle heading straight down the lane. The man had directed us onto the freeway. Cars zoomed by on both sides. I don't believe in God, but in that moment I began to pray to something, my sweaty palms slipping on the wheel.

In the wide mirror above the windshield, I could see the back of the man's shiny bald head as he stepped to the aisle with open arms.

"Will you all SHUT UP?" he bellowed with a surprising ferocity for his frail form. "Losing your heads won't change a thing." The chaos paused, everyone turning to look at him in shock.

I kept my eyes on the road.

"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the tour of a lifetime," said the old man with the bravado of a ring-leader. There were noises of protest and confusion. The baby began to fuss softly.

"What is this?" the businessman spoke up boldly, breaking the tension. "A terrorist attack?"

A wet crunch echoed through the near-silent bus, like a watermelon smashed on pavement, followed by a chorus of shrieks and gasps. In abject horror, I realized that the old man had stepped on the dead driver.

"I already told you," the old man said. He sounded impatient. "It's a tour. How dull can you be?"

I wanted to leap up and do something, anything, but all I could do was drive. The old man cleared his throat.

"Now, first things first. If we're going to get to know each other on this little trip, we can't be buried in our cellular devices. I see you all typing, sending little messages. Can't have that. Give them to me, please." I heard a shuffling as most people complied out of abject fear.

"*Please*." He said more insistently. Glancing in the mirror again, I saw that he'd drawn a gun from his waistband and was pointing it at the women in the mauve coat.

She sat there, unsmiling. He cocked the gun.

She handed her phone over.

"Anyone else? Last call!" No one moved. Satisfied, the old man moved to stand at the front again.

"Now, let's go around. Everyone share their name and, oh what the heck, one fun fact about yourself."

While this was happening, I considered the bus's brake system. The thought crossed my mind: if I could just stop the bus, maybe we had a fighting chance. Or, better yet, if someone could distract him while he was giving his spiel...

"I'll go first," the man was saying cheerfully. "Call me Frank. Fun fact, I used to be a pastor before I found my true calling."

I scanned the freeway for a safe spot to pull over to the shoulder. Where would we even go if we made it off?

It was at this point I remembered: Frank hadn't confiscated *my* phone. As I tried to subtly fish for it in my back pocket without losing control of the wheel, I listened.

There were thirteen of us in total, not counting our kidnapper.

The woman in the mauve coat was a lawyer named Natalie.

The businessman, Ed, had three daughters at home.

Kim, the woman with the baby, was a forensic student at the nearby college.

The rest of the passengers continued to introduce themselves, but I tuned them out as I opened the message app on my phone and began to type one-handed, glancing up intermittently to avoid swerving.

I struggled with how to give our current location to emergency services aside from the general name of the freeway. I scanned the roadside for any kind of signage.

Then I saw it: *Rest Stop, 1 Mile*.

I sent my message to 911, hoping for the best.

Behind me, one of the high schoolers, Jackson, asked a question.

"Where are we going?" There was a long, measured silence. I gripped the wheel with white knuckles, waiting for the worst.

"A party," said Frank. "A birthday party." For who, he didn't say.

The rest stop came into view.

Now was my chance. As smoothly as I could manage, I switched lanes. I took the exit, tearing into the large vehicle zone. It was midday by now. The rest stop was relatively busy, with families and truckers ducking in and out of the main building to use the restroom and buy refreshments.

I engaged the brake with a deafening screech. A roar of panic rose as everyone was thrown by the sudden stop. Once things settled, people immediately began to clamber from their seats, slamming against the closed automatic doors and clawing at the emergency exits.

I saw something flash in my peripheral. Frank had turned the gun on me. I was cornered in the driver's seat.

"If you all leave, this man dies," he said calmly. I shook my head violently, dizzy with fear.

If the group sentenced me to death, they had a chance at freedom. If they spared me, who knows where we would be headed. He was offering a literal trolley problem.

I stared into Frank's weathered gaze, trying to seem braver than I was. One of his eyes was pure black, like an eight ball fracture. Somehow, I hadn't noticed that before. It seemed to be leaking a dark, viscous substance.

I noticed something else there, too. Desperation, I realized. He didn't want to kill me.

I opened the doors.

As I did, Ed, the businessman, tackled Frank from behind.

The gun went off.

I felt a searing pain across my face, my ears ringing from the pain and noise. I crumpled back against the window, head throbbing. My vision swam as I surveyed my surroundings.

The two men wrestled in the aisle. There was a bottleneck at the doors, but some people had managed to escape by now.

What follows is perhaps the least explicable of all the events I'd witnessed so far.

Ed grabbed Frank's head, shoving him to the floor. As he did, Frank's head simply... gave way.

It crumpled like a rotten pumpkin, splattering more of that viscous liquid across the seats and his suit.

Ed screamed, scrambling back and wiping the sick contamination from his body. A steam began to rise from his skin and suit.

Wherever the liquid had touched him, circles of pure, raw red were opening up on his flesh. In a matter of seconds, the tiny pockmarks turned to open sores which deepened like tunnels, until it looked as if he had been burrowed from the inside out. The air smelled rank, like turned meat searing on a grill. I was reminded of a shipment of bad pork I'd had to toss in the dumpster behind the restaurant, how the surface swelled with maggots. My stomach churned.

As quickly as Frank's head had come apart, it began to reform. Like a time lapse in reverse, the skull and skin rearranged themselves, shards of bones clicking back into place through some unseen means.

No longe restrained, Frank went for the door mechanism, forcing them shut again with a hiss.

I couldn't fight back. I didn't want to risk touching that walking mass of disease. He was sick in more ways than one.

I crawled from the seat as Frank took the wheel again, trying to avoid touching the pools of stinking liquid now leeching from Ed's twitching body.

I found my place on the bench and lay there to catch my breath. Natalie sat across from me, her knees tucked in. I wanted to say something, to apologize for not taking her seriously that morning. I didn't have the energy to muster up more than an apologetic look. She turned away, looking out the window. No one felt much like talking.

Next to her sat two of the high-schoolers, Jackson and a girl whose name I didn't know. At the back of the bus sat an old white-haired woman with a shopping bag, who also hadn't managed to make it out before the doors shut.

Five people, two bodies. One driver who I am now certain is not human, at least not anymore.

The bus lurched back onto the freeway, careening towards an unknown fate.

We were nothing more than its passengers.

\_\_

This happened two days ago. My temple is still throbbing where the bullet grazed my skin, but it's stopped bleeding. I have all but given up on emergency services coming to our aid. It's as if we've entered into some strange dimension where nothing can reach us.

Nothing but Frank.

We have only ever stopped to get gas or supplies a few times. There is a decrepit, filthy toilet system in the back alcove of this bus. We discovered it on the first day. The only food on board were the old woman's groceries. They quickly ran out among the five people. Now, we divide up whatever miscellaneous scraps Frank throws our way. He doesn't want us to starve. It's like he needs us to stay alive, for whatever reason.

When he leaves, the bodies watch us. Propped up in the aisle with vacant, glass stares.

I have seen them blink.

The other day, I heard Frank muttering to himself about directions. I think we might be close to our destination. The birthday party. I have a prickling in my stomach, almost like excitement. Maybe it's just my yearning for clean air untarnished by the smell of rot.

I can't be sure if my messages are making it out of this hell at all. I'm bored out of my mind, to tell the truth. I've never been one for road trips. So, here I am, shouting into the void to pass the time.

Just in case: it's a blue bus with silver stripes, plastered with some beauty advertisement on one side and an anti-smoking PSA on the other. Bus 6. If you see hands pressed to the glass, please set us free.

We're so very far from [home](https://www.reddit.com/user/3_Magpies/comments/1n1wlbl/3magpies_story_masterpost/).
