I felt like hell, and once again I didn’t get the sleep I needed. When morning rose, I had to remove a few reps from my workout because my head just couldn’t take it and I felt like throwing up. The first time in years that I couldn’t complete my routine.

 

I checked my messages and still got nothing back yet. I checked my other account, and I had gained around 4 followers, and my photo had 2 likes. Interesting. I took and posted another selfie just to keep the game going a little while longer, despite my internal objections. I was slowly figuring out the posing. I did a little strategic maneuvering of my free hand to push my boobs together so they looked more impressive. Things you don’t learn in the police academy.

 

“Jesus, Cole. You look like shit.” Gray greeted as I got inside.

 

“Thanks.” I answered wearily, shielding my eyes from the fluorescent lights.

 

“You weren’t up all night doin’ your online thing were you? I told you, don’t do that shit.”

 

“It wasn’t all night... I just have a headache, that’s all. Didn’t get the best sleep.”

 

“Alright well take care of yourself for god’s sake... Did you find anything out?”

 

“Not much yet. Potential lead, just waiting on a response.” I answered, rubbing my brow. “Weird interaction with an old homeless lady, though.”

 

“Huh?”

 

“Just... this old lady on the road after I left last night... She licked my window...”

 

“She... what?”

 

“Licked my car window... Said some weird shit... I don’t know...”

 

“...The fuck?”

 

“That’s what I said... But anyways, what are we doing today?”

 

“You want me to just breeze past that?”

 

“I’d like to if you don’t mind.”

 

“Alright... Well... you’re gonna have to start looking alive, because we got the search party organized. We’re heading out for the woods in a half hour. Only about eight of us, it was all I could pull. Couldn’t risk civilian volunteers in there after what happened to that goddamn goat, so we make due.”

 

“Ah, shit.”

 

“Get some fuckin’ food in you so you don’t keel over out there, huh?”

 

I didn’t even realize I forgot to eat again, but I guess he could see it on my face. I stopped for a bagel at Tim’s on the way there.

 

I arrived at the spot outside the woods and parked amid the slim selection of cars and police cruisers. Our entry point was close to the farm like last time. The sun was viciously bright. It wasn’t ideal to do a search wearing shades, but if I didn’t my head might explode.

 

After a few more arrived, Gray got out in front of the small crowd and projected his voice, laying out the plan. We paired off into four groups of two and each group took a section of woods. Given the size of the area, it was highly unlikely we would be able to survey it all but it was the best we could do for now.

 

Gray and I paired off for where we designated Sector C, and I handled navigation as best as I could. The first half hour of the search was brutal on my headache and general tiredness, but I was able to fall into a rhythm and the next hour flew by relatively easily.

 

We didn’t hear many reports on the walkie from the other teams, just general status updates, no findings. This was slowly beginning to feel like a fruitless venture.

 

“So...” I spoke up, trying to make time go faster. “What part of New York are you from?”

 

Gray laughed, “That bored?”

 

“Little bit... So, what? Brooklyn?”

 

“Yonkers.” He answered.

 

“So what’s good in Yonkers?” I asked casually as we continued to trek.

 

“Ah, not much if you were me. Spent most of my time out on the streets, off my shit on drugs, gettin’ into fights. I didn’t have the prettiest experience... Food was good though.”

 

I decided to follow up with the question that had been on my mind for days now, “How does a street punk from Yonkers end up in Greenwood as a fed?”

 

“Fed... You’re a total fuckin’ narc. I pray you never have to go undercover...” He mocked. “And I could ask you somethin’ similar, because you don’t make no sense to me.”

 

“How do I not make sense?” I volleyed, unsure of where he was gonna go with this.

 

“You wanna get into this? You want me to speak freely?”

 

I snorted. “When have you ever not spoken freely?”

 

“True... Alright so you used to be a guy, yeah?” Gray said, very matter of fact. I was completely thrown off my game by his bluntness. I got so used to people skirting around it, but I should’ve known better with this guy.

 

“Okay that’s enough speaking freely.” I jabbed back.

 

“No, no, no. Hear me out, it’s not what you think. I mean I get it in general, y’know? And that’s awesome and I’m happy for people. Let’s all live our best lives. But I mean you specifically, it doesn’t make sense to me.”

 

“Okay...” I muttered, very suspiciously. I made a subtle gesture for him to continue. How bad was this conversation about to be?

 

“Like, you wanted to be a detective. You wanted to work in law enforcement. Dreamed about it since you were a kid and whatnot, right?... That shit is one of the most men-heavy hyper fuckin’ masculine careers that there is. And you could’a just gone in there and done it no problem, you had that leg up, but you were like “Nah I’d rather do this as a woman. Not only that, but a transgender woman, which is a whole other thing in society these days. Oh, and then on top of that I’ll move out to the country with all the crotchety old bible thumpers.” and I don’t get the decision making there.”

 

“I mean when you put it like that...” I joked. I felt a bit of relief that his thoughts weren’t too out of pocket.

 

“And hey I don’t mean no disrespect.” Gray added, sincerely.

 

“Well... I don’t know. I don’t really have an answer, because it’s not really a ‘why’ thing? I just... AM a woman. I figured that out pretty early... You said I’d suck going undercover and that’s probably true, because I was basically undercover every day and it did suck, so I fixed it... And you were right, I’ve also always wanted to be a detective so... It may not be practical but that’s the hand I’m dealt. I didn’t want to give up what I love for who I am... As for why I’m here, I just like it here. I like the sky. I like the air... That’s pretty much it.”

 

I was a bit surprised by my own honesty. But he seemed to be asking in earnest, so I responded in earnest.

 

Gray stood back, gave a silent nod, and then simply responded, “Huh... Well alright, Cole.” I guess he got it.

 

“You still didn’t answer my question.” I said, changing the subject.

 

“Hah. I’ll tell you some other time.”

 

“What the fuck?” I snapped, half seriously. “I just told you all this uncomfortable personal shit...”

 

“Yeah, well, there’s a time and a place. We’re working now, for god’s sake.” He jabbed.

 

“You are a real... You are something else.”

 

Gray smirked. “I’m a professional... But I do wanna ask one more thing.”

 

“Oh well I’m not fucking answering now.”

 

Gray ignored me and went on. “I’m just wondering, like, are you happy with it?”

 

“Happy with...?”

 

“Your whole transition thing, you’re happy with it?”

 

“Of course. It’s the best thing I’ve ever done.”

 

“Okay... good. That’s good. It’s just... you’re kind of a mopey person, so I dunno.”

 

“What the f-... Why are you my mother all of a sudden?”

 

“I’m just sayin’, you went through all that to get here and you don’t seem happy.”

 

I let out an exasperated chuckle, “Of course I’m not happy! I have to work with YOU, motherfucker. I’m miserable. Life is still life. Plus I’m still dealing with murderers and creeps daily. You want me to smile while we’re out here looking for more decapitated goats? What about you? Why aren’t you happy?”

 

“Alright, see, that’s defensiveness.”

 

“It’s not defensiveness, it’s a stupid ass question. You don’t see me outside of work, you don’t know my life.”

 

Gray threw up his hands. “Alright, if you say so.”

 

“...And fuck you for making me answer another personal thing.”

 

We continued on as the sun rose from beaming directly in front of us to hanging over us and hiding amidst some generous clouds. Finally I felt okay enough to remove my sunglasses. It didn’t help much though, we weren’t finding anything.

 

A muffled crackling sound shot through the walkie-talkie. At first it sounded like it might be interference, or someone hitting the button by accident. Then it happened again, but this time amidst the static sounds were sounds of screams. Gray and I shot to attention.

 

Gray held the walkie up and began to speak. “What’s going on out there?”

 

A minute of silence followed. Gray and I looked at each other with matching expressions of concern.

 

“Officer down! Get over here, now! Need assistance! Sector A!” The man’s voice came shouting from the walkie.

 

I got us our bearings and we sprinted towards Sector A. It was going to be a hell of a sprint. The throbbing in my head returned almost immediately. I wasn’t prepared for this. Gray, for his size, held up fairly well.

 

My mind raced. What could have happened? It could have been an animal attack, but there weren’t much in the way of top predators out here. No, it had to be our person. Whoever strung up the goat’s head. Whoever has Harmony... Or maybe it was Harmony herself.

 

Finally, after about 15 minutes of dead sprinting, we arrived on the scene. One officer was slumped against a tree and the other was kneeling over him, administering some kind of care. Didn’t take long to notice the blood pouring from his neck.

 

“Fuck!” Gray exclaimed as we both rushed over to his aid. “What happened?”

 

“I didn’t see it.” The kneeling officer explained. “We were fanned out. Suddenly I hear a scream and...”

 

I knelt closer to the man, taking notice of his name tag. Donaldson. Then I took note of his condition. Deep lacerations on the side of his neck, along with a large, red discoloration on the opposite side of his face. Maybe some kind of burn. Below it, though... dripping down from his face. Candle wax.

 

This time it wasn’t hardened. It was translucent and liquid. It was still hot. What did it mean? Some kind of mark? Something ritualistic?

 

I needed to know what he saw, but there was no way he would be able to talk to us now. The pain and fear etched into his face was something I knew I would never be able to forget. But still I looked into his eyes and made sure he looked into mine.

 

“You’re gonna be alright, Donaldson. We’ve got you.” I said, with every bit of assuredness that I could muster. Hoping it would give him even an ounce of the comfort and calm he would need to be able to make it through this.

 

That’s not the reaction I got, however. Instead his pupils dilated, and then his eyes widened. He began to flail and let out a gurgling scream. He kicked his legs and pushed at me with his limp hands. He was scared... of me.

 

I stood up and created some distance. Gray shot a confused look back at me, which I returned. Why on earth would he be afraid of me?

 

I turned back to the seemingly endless woods with that question rattling around in my brain, but it was tossed aside when I saw movement. Far off into the woods, I couldn’t see what it was. Could have been a deer for all I knew, but my gut told me it wasn’t. And my gut is what I chose to follow.

 

Donaldson was being taken care of. The rest were on their way, and the paramedics were called. That situation was under control. I made my choice. I chose to run.

 

Gray yelled after me but I didn’t listen, and I knew he wouldn’t follow.

 

“Cole! Get the fuck back here! Do not go out there alone!” He called out into my walkie talkie after I left shouting distance. Once again I ignored it and pulled out my gun.

 

My head would not stop pounding, it felt like my brain was being shaken like a martini in my skull with every stride. But I had an advantage this time. They couldn’t hide in the dark. They could only run, and I was faster than them.

 

I didn’t see anyone but I heard the consistent rustling of trees far ahead of me. That was all I needed to know that I was moving in the right direction. But the woods were getting denser. I felt twigs and branches slice at my face and my clothes. It became harder to stay the course and suddenly the rustling of the woods was only coming from myself.

 

I continued running to the best of my ability until my head refused to bear it any longer. My vision got cloudy and narrow. I tried to power through, but in the haze my leg got caught on a low branch and I tumbled forward. My face violently collided with the bark of the tree in front of me and I collapsed in a heap.

 

The air was knocked out of me and my chest heaved with exhaustion. I pushed myself too far. My muscles were throbbing the same as my head and they were so weak, I was unsure if I would be able to get up. I could feel blood trickling down my face.

 

I held my eyes closed in a wince as the pain shot through my entire body in waves, but my head was the worst by far. I felt concussed. I didn’t dare open my eyes to the unforgiving light. I needed a few minutes in darkness.

 

My body decided I would need more than that, however, as I began slipping in and out of consciousness. It felt like minutes but it could have been hours. All I knew was that I slowly felt the warmth of the sun go away.

 

I felt something on my cheek. The softest caress of a slender and feminine hand. It almost didn’t feel real. I felt it before, in my dreams. Amidst the constant throbbing pain, it was comforting and nurturing. I still didn’t have it in me to open my eyes. One of my eyes felt heavier than usual, I could only assume it was swelling from the impact.

 

The caresses were slowly joined by a current of steady, warm breaths against my face. I could feel a presence mere inches from me. Their breath moving from my eyes down to my mouth, like they were studying me.

 

Then something warm and wet touched the bottom of my chin and began to slide up my face. Curving a path around my nose and up to my forehead. It was licking the trail of blood off my face. I couldn’t keep my eyes closed anymore, I forced them open.

 

The sky was much darker now, only a little bit of orange left, but there she was. Harmony. The girl I’d been looking for all this time, now inches from my face. She grinned at me with my blood in her teeth. Her left eye was missing, just like in my dreams, just like in the glitched footage; and she was deeply emaciated. Her skin was nearly grey.

 

I knew she was going to kill me. I saw it within her smile. What happened? How did that bright, cheery girl become this?

 

Her hands moved gracefully around my throat and began to squeeze. I looked deep into her remaining eye, desperate to find some semblance of humanity within it. But as her eye met mine, something changed. Her smile suddenly dropped. Her grip on me weakened. She looked almost confused.

 

I could only think of one thing. Donaldson. Why did they both look at me like this? I couldn’t understand.

 

Her smile slowly reformed however, and she began to squeeze again even tighter, only to be interrupted by a sound coming from behind us.

 

“Cole! Cole, where are you!?” Gray called out, exasperated.

 

Harmony released her grip and quickly skulked off into the woods. I had no more strength to give chase.

 

“Here!” I yelled out in a cracked voice in between coughs. I heard him slowly make his way to me.

 

He stumbled and collapsed in front of me, gasping for breath. It was clear she got away before he could see her.

 

“Jesus Christ, I’ve been looking all over for you!” He huffed. “What the hell happened? Why would you run off like that, you stupid-”

 

“I’m sorry...” I croaked. “Is Donaldson okay?”

 

“What? Yeah, we got him outta there. He’s in the hospital now, I’d imagine.”

 

“Good.”

 

“You look like you could use a trip yourself, Cole. Fucking hell.”

 

I attempted to sit up, “No. Just some ice and some ibuprofen, I’ll be fine.”

 

“Are you sure? What the hell happened to you? Who did that to your face?”

 

“A tree. But listen-“

 

“A tree?”

 

“Move past it. Listen. I saw the girl. She was right here. Right in front of my face. She looked... she wasn’t herself. Gray, she was missing her left eye.”

 

“What?”

 

I extended my arm. Gray grabbed it and gingerly hoisted me up to my feet. I struggled to find my balance, the world wouldn’t stop spinning.

 

“Harmony isn’t the victim here. We’re not just looking for a lost girl. Something’s been done to her.” I attempted to explain.

 

“Okay, slow down...”

 

The last bit of light faded from the sky and we were left with only the pale blues of the night. The dark sent a glacial chill coursing under my skin. I lost my desire to continue explaining. Not here. Not now. I only had one thing left to say.

 

“We have to get out of here.”
