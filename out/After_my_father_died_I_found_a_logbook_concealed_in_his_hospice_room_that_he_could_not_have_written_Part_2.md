Thank you all for your patience. 

This has been a trying few weeks, only to be unironically complicated by my own health going on the fritz. In spite of setbacks, I am trying to remain steadfast. I have already made the irreversible decision to disseminate John Morrison’s deathbed logbook, and I will try to suffer any consequences with dignity. I think I am starting to desire contrition, but, in a sense, it might already be too late. I may be irredeemable. 

I am jumping ahead a bit. For now, what’s important to restate is that I have already read the logbook in its entirety. As you might imagine, digesting the events described was beyond emotionally draining. And while that’s all well and good, if it didn’t matter, I wouldn’t bother dragging you all through the miasma with me. However, my investigation into the logbook also has some narrative significance in tying everything together. I hope that my commentary will serve to put you in my mind’s eye, so to speak. 

As a reminder, this image ([https://imgur.com/a/Rb2VbHP](https://imgur.com/a/Rb2VbHP)) is going to become increasingly vital as we progress. Take a moment with it. The more you understand this sigil, the better you’ll come to comprehend my motivations and, eventually, my regrets. 

Entry 2:

Dated as August 2004 to March 2005

*Second Translocation, subsequent events, analysis.*

*“Honestly, it reminds me a little bit of the time I did LSD,” Greg half-whispered, clearly trying, and I guess failing, to camouflage his immense self-satisfaction.*

*“Mom would have enrolled you in a seminary if she knew you did LSD before you were legally allowed to drink” I returned, rolling my eyes with a confident finesse - a finely tuned and surgically precise sarcastic flourish, a byproduct of reluctantly weathering the aforementioned self-satisfaction for the better part of three decades.* 

*Perched on the railing of my backyard deck, full bellied from our brotherly tradition of once-a-month surf and turf, we watched the sun begin its earthly descent. As much as I love my brother, his temperament has always been offensively antithetical to me - a real caution to the wind, living life to the fullest, salt of the earth type. To be more straightforward, I was jealous of his liberation, his buoyant, joyful abandon. Meanwhile, I was ravenous for control. Take this example: I didn’t have my first beer till I was 25. I had parlayed this to my boyhood friends as a heroic reticence to “jeopardize my future career”, which became an obviously harder sell from the ages of 21 to 25. In reality, control, or more accurately, the illusion of it, had always been the needle plunging into my veins. Greg, on the other hand, had fearlessly partaken in all manner of youthful alchemy prior to leaving high school - LSD, MDMA, THC. The entire starting line-up of drug-related acronyms, excluding PCP. Even his playful degeneracy had its limits. But every movement he made, he made with a certain loving acceptance of reality. He embraced the whole of it.* 

*“It scared the shit out of me, man. I mean, where do you suppose I got the inspiration for all that? I know it was a hallucination, or I guess an “aura”, but when you have those types of things, aren’t they based on something? You know, a movie or show or…?”. I was really searching for some reassurance here.*

*“Well, when I tripped on LSD, I was chased by some pedophile wearing kashmere and threatening me with these gnarly-ass claws.” Greg paused for a moment, calculating. “Y’know, I told that trip story at a bar two years to the day before Nightmare on Elm Street was released. Some jackanape must have overheard and sold my intellectual property to Warner Brothers. I could be living in Beverly Hills right now.”* 

*“Nightmare on Elm Street was released by New Line Cinema, you jackanape.”*

*He conceded a small chuckle and looked back at a horizonbound sun. Internal preparations for his next set of antics were in motion, judging by his newfound concentration. He was always attempting to keep the joke going. He was my favorite anesthetic.* 

*“I mean you kinda had your own Freddy,” Greg finally said. “No claws, though. He’s gonna get ya’ with his scary wrist string. I don’t think New Line is going to payout for that idea at this point, though.”*

*My pulse quickened, but I did not immediately know why.*

*After my first translocation, I had a resounding difficulty not discussing it at every possible turn. It was a bit of a compulsion - a mounting pressure that would build up behind my eyes and my sinuses until I finally gave in and recounted the whole damn ordeal. Lucy was a bit tired of it, but her innate sainthood prohibited her from overly criticizing me. Never one to kick someone when they’re already down. Greg was not cursed with the same piety.* 

*“I just think you need to make light of it - give it a tiny bit of levity?” He paused again, waiting for my response. I kept my gaze focused away from him and began to pseudo-busy myself by tracing the shape of a cloud with my eyes. We sat for a moment, my body acclimating to the foreboding calmness of the moment. The quiet melody of the wind through long grass accenting an approaching demarcation.* 

*“I think its name is Atlas, though.”*

*I still refused to look back. Truthfully, I futilely tried to convince myself that this was some new joke - a reference to some new piece of media I was unaware of. What pierced my delusion, however, was the abrupt silence. I could no longer appreciate the wind through the grass - that cosmic hymn had been cut short in lieu of something else. All things had gone deathly quiet, portending a familiar maelstrom.* 

*When I looked at Greg, he was still facing forward, his head and shoulders machinelike and dead. His right eye, despite the rest of his body being at a ninety-degree angle with mine, was singularly focused on me. I couldn’t appreciate his left eye from where I was sitting, but I imagine it was irreversibly tilted to the inside of his skull, stubbornly attempting to spear me in tandem with his right despite all the brain tissue and bone in the way.* 

*This recognizable shift petrified me, and I knew it was coming. Not from where, but I knew.*

*Atlas was coming.* 

*With a blasphemously sadistic leisure, the right side of Greg’s face began to expand. The skin was slowly pulled tight around something seemingly trying to exit my brother from the inside. This accursed metamorphosis was accompanied by the same annihilating cacophony as before. Laughs, screams, screeching of tires, fireworks, thousands upon thousands of words spoken simultaneously, crescendoing to a depthless fever pitch. As the serging visage became clearer, as it stretched the skin to its structural limit to clearly reveal the shape of another head, flesh and fascia audibly ripping among the cacophony, a single eye victoriously bore through Greg’s cheek.* 

*Atlas.* 

*And for a moment, everything ceased. Hypnotized, or maybe shellshocked, I slowly appreciated a scar on the white of the eye itself, thick and cauterized, running its way in a semicircle above the iris itself.* 

*But it wasn’t an eye, or at least it wasn’t just an eye. I couldn’t determine why I knew that.* 

*When had I seen this before?*

*With breakneck speed, my consciousness returned, and I had an infinitesimal fraction of a moment to watch a tree rapidly approach my field of view. I think within that iota of time, I thought of Greg. And in his honor, I made manifest a certain loving acceptance of present circumstances. I let go. Only then did I hear the sound of gnawing metal and rupturing glass, and I was gone again.* 

*I awoke in the hospital, this time with injuries too numerous to list here. Driving home from work, I hit a tree at sixty miles per hour. I was lucky to be alive.*

*With a newly diagnosed seizure disorder, I technically was not supposed to be driving to and from work. It was theorized that a seizure had led to my crash. I agreed, but that did not tell the whole story.* 

*When I got out of the hospital, I asked Greg if he remembered talking about LSD and A Nightmare on Elm Street on the porch with me years back, not expecting much. To my surprise, however, he did recall something similar to that. In his version, the conversation started because of how excited he was that Wes Craven’s New Nightmare just had come out on VHS. In other words, late 1995. Seemingly a few months chronologically forward from the memory in my first translocation.* 

*In the following months, bedbound and on a battery of higher potency anticonvulsants, I had a lot of time to reflect on what I would begin to describe as “translocations”. I will try to prove the existence of said translocations, though I am not altogether hopeful that it will make complete sense. Let me start with this:*

*The two translocations I have experienced so far follow a predictable pattern: I am reliving a memory. The ambient noise of the memory fades out to complete and utter silence, followed by Atlas appearing with his cacophony.* 

*I want to start small by dissecting one individual part of that: the auditory component. What I find so fascinating is the initial dissolution of the sound recorded in my memory. Seemingly, before the cacophony begins, the ambient noise of the memory is eliminated - it does not just continue on to eventually add to the cacophony. Not only that, its disappearance seems to be the harbinger to the arrival of Atlas. But why does it disappear? Why would it not just layer on top of everything else? Why is this important? To explain, take the physics of noise-eliminating headphones, shown in figure 1 (*[https://imgur.com/a/S6pHGhd](https://imgur.com/a/S6pHGhd)*).* 

*When sound bombards noise canceling headphones, it is filtered through a microphone, which approximates the wavelength of that sound. Once approximated, circuitry in the headphone then inverts* *that wavelength. That inverted wavelength is played through the headphone, which effectively cancels* *the wavelength made by the original sound.*

*Think about it this way: imagine combining a positive number and the same number but it is negative - what you are left with is zero. In terms of sound, that is silence. In the figure, my memory is represented by the solid line, and the contribution from Atlas is represented by the dotted line.* 

*What does this mean? To me, if we apply the metaphor to my translocations, that means* *Atlas is acting as the microphone.* *Some part of Atlas is an opposite, an inverse, of a memory. Of my memory.* 

*Inevitably, the question that follows is this:*

*What in God’s name is the inverse of a memory?*

End of Entry 2 

John’s car crash could not have come at a worse time in my adolescence. I think that was when I was the most disconnected from him. He was always introverted, sure. He was religious about attending his work and his paintings, yes since the moment I was born. But he wasn’t reclusive until I began middle school. Day by day, he became more disinterested. My mom interpreted this as depression, I interpreted it as disappointment (in me and his life). There were fleeting moments where I felt John Morrison appear whole, comedic and passionate and caring. But they became less and less frequent overtime. When he had his first seizure and started medication, somehow it seemed to get even worse. But when he had his near-fatal crash, I thought I had lost him and our disconnect had become forever irreconcilable. 

But as he slowly recovered, I began to see more and more of him reappear. Clouds parting in the night sky, celestial bodies returning with some spare, guiding moonlight. That period of my life was memorable and defining, but ultimately ephemeral, like all good things. 

Now, with that out of the way, we stand upon the precipice of it all. 

This entry, for reasons that will become apparent, left me unsustainably disconcerted. After reading it, I nearly sprinted off my desk chair to the trash can in my kitchen. I held the logbook above the open lid, trying to force my hand to release and just let it all go. To just allow myself to forget.

In the end, I couldn’t do it. Defeated by something I could not hope to comprehend, I sat down at my kitchen table, staring intently at the mirror hanging opposite to me. Focusing on my left eye, I acknowledged the distinctive conjunctival scar forming a crest above my iris. Seemingly the shape of the ubiquitous sigil featured at the top of post, while also seemingly a feature Atlas and I shared. A souvenir from an injury I sustained only one year ago. 

In that translocation, John saw my eye, or something like it. But in time, I would determine that is not what he actually recognized at that moment.
