I don't know where else to turn, so I'm posting this here. Although my hotel seems normal, there seems to be something going on in Room 333, and I can't get rid of the feeling that I'm not alone.  
  
When I travel for work, I usually stay in inexpensive hotels. I went to this old place last night, and it looked like it hadn't been updated since the 1980s. With a forced smile that didn't reach her eyes, the front desk clerk handed me the key to Room 333. It was supposed to be just another evening.

The moment I walked into the room, a shiver went down my spine. Although the hallway was normal, it was freezing. There was a heavy, unsettling energy in the air. I attempted to dismiss it, saying it was just fatigue.  
  
After unpacking, I heard the first whisper as I got into bed. It sounded so faint, like the wind rustling leaves. I wrote it off to being tired and dismissed it as my imagination. But after a while, the murmurs became clearer and louder.

I had trouble reading the words at first. It resembled an audio only conversation that was happening far away. But the voices got clearer as the night went on. Desperately, they were pleading. I strained to make out what she was saying.  
  
It sounded as though the voices were telling stories of sorrow, loss, and hopelessness. Their words made me feel as though the room itself carried the memories of all the people who had suffered there. The whispers carried tales of ruined loves, abrupt deaths, and regrets that persisted after death.

When I attempted to exit the room, the doorknob remained stuck. I became panicked when I realized I was stuck. The murmurs grew louder, their tone changing from sadness to rage. When I turned around, I felt a chilly hand on my shoulder, but nobody was there. An evil energy seemed to pulse through the room.  
Shadows danced on the walls as I sat on the edge of the bed, terrified. In the gloomy light, twisted faces emerged. The whispers continued, so I closed my eyes, hoping it was all a nightmare. They pleaded for relief, for someone to pay attention to their tales and feel their suffering.

After several hours, the first rays of dawn peeked through the curtains, just as I was about to give up. The whispers subsided over time, and the room's temperature stabilized. With ease, the doorknob turned, and I staggered out, completely unsteady.  
  
I had to share this even though I have no idea what transpired in Room 333. Although I don't believe in ghosts, I can assure you that whatever is in that room is real. The whispers are still there, just a little bit, in the back of my mind, and I worry they won't let go. Do yourself a favor and request a different room, or better yet, find another place to stay, if you ever find yourself in a hotel and they assign you Room 333.
