Hi, I'm Max, and whatever is going on here I don't even have words for. Growing up going to Catholic School, I always thought the things said about hell were a bit extreme. However, I think I may be there now. This may be hell, I don't know, I don't know what anything is anymore. I don't know how to describe what happened to my Brother, or Tatiana. I can't explain what the phone I'm typing this on even is. I guess I'm only typing this to warn other people, and maybe get some help.

It all started a few months ago Me and my friends I decided to take a trip to New York. It was supposed to be innocent. It was initially Tatiana's idea to go to Radio City Hall. Mikie had been the one to find this play called the Nine Circles that was going to be playing when we were in New York. It was meant to be an adaptation of Dante's Inferno. Or at least that was what we thought. My brother Nathan and his boyfriend Mac, as well as two of my other friends, Jeremiah and Elijah. We're also coming along. It was supposed to just be a nice trip. We were gonna have some fun.

When I had booked the tickets, it looked like the place was going to be packed. It was on the second-to-last day of our trip to New York.

The week before that had been fun. We had been to Times Square and to a bunch of museums that Tatiana and Mac wanted to see. Mikie had been asking me the entire week why Nathan seemed so tense around each other. It's nothing, me and Nate were close when we were younger, but then I went off to college, and things changed. It was nothing all that intresting. Mikie also got us all to go ice-skating. Then the second-to-last day got there, we wanted to be back at the hotel by midnight because we had an early train.

When we got there, it was Mikie who pointed out that the traffic leading up to the place was almost non-existent. It felt strange for a place that was supposed to be packed to have such little traffic. When we got inside, there was only one person on staff. When Nathan went to get something to eat. He said there was nothing, no vending machine, no one working at the concessions stand. It felt like there was something off.

When I went up to the one staffer, he looked strange; it felt like his smile was just a bit too big, his eyes never quite met mine. Then, when we walked into the theater itself, it was completely empty. Tatiana asked if I had gotten the time wrong, but I hadn't. I kept looking at the tickets like I was hoping the time would magically change, and it would all start making sense. The relief I had hoped for never did come. We all got to are seats, the tickets said the show would start at 8 PM; however, when I checked my phone and the time had already ticked over to 8:05. That was when the room went dark.

However, the darkness started to stretch, then the stage lit up. This group of people was on stage, it felt like one of them was staring directly at us. It was hard to make out their faces even though are seats were good. Mikie whispered to me that he thought he had heard something behind us. When I turned around, there was nothing there. However, when I turned back around, the stage had gone mostly dark. Then there was a silhouette before the light on the stage flickered back on. There was a woman with black hair and skin so white she looked like a piece of porcelain. It's what I assumed people who had no blood looked like; her hair was pure black. The dress she was wearing was floor-length and pure black there were slits that showed both of her legs, which were the same porcelain color as her face.

She tilted her head and held up three fingers. She slowly put the first one down, then the second, then the third. That was what seemed to start it. There was this sudden thud, and it took a few seconds before Jeremiah started to scream. When I looked over, this thing was on top of him. It was tall, and it had bitten into Jeremiah's neck. I flew out of my chair as I yanked myself backward. I tried to drag myself backward, keeping my eyes on Jeremiah. Everyone had started to yell.

There were more of those things; they were squatting on the edges of the seats before there had to be ten of them. I got a look at them, and they looked like something inhuman. Their skin was a shade of light red. Their feet looked webbed with three toes that had talons at the end. Their hands were like the feet, but with two fingers instead of three, with talons at the end. Nathan had fallen onto the floor and suddenly started screaming bloody murder, then he was dragged off, trying to grab onto anything he could, but it was useless; he was dragged into the aisle. Mikie, who had been sitting next to me, had grabbed onto my hand. I yanked away and started army crawling across the floor.

The sound of rustling of what I hoped was Mikie behind me. I turned around to look at the group, and Jeremiah had stopped moving. Elijah had gotten underneath the seats. Mac was standing in the middle of the aisle when he started yelling for Nathan. Tatiana, though she had hardly moved, she was just staring ahead. Then there was this sound like something flying overhead. Then Tatiana was just grabbed and started screaming. Something was holding onto her; it was whatever had made the flying sound. It had wings. I could see the wings overhead, they cast a shadow across the stage. Going back to crawling. I made it to the edge of the aisle. That's when the sound of that woman on stage yelled. "Bring me the rest of them!" Then I poked my head up slightly to see those things squatting on the edges of the seats start to leap forward. and rapidly start closing in on us.

I finished dragging myself forward and stood up to run into the aisle. I was standing in the third aisle. Looking back, they had arrived and all coalesced around Elijah, Mac, and Mikie. They picked Mikie up like he was a rag doll. The screaming had mostly gone quiet. The woman on stage was pacing. I slowly backed down the aisle. Then started running for the doors at the back of the room. When I got there, the door was locked, and I beat on the door. That was the mistake; it drew the attention of the women on stage and those things. "BRING THAT ONE TO ME!" It echoed through the hall, and I turned around. The entire group of those things was running down the aisle towards me. I couldn't see any of my friends on stage; I didn't even know where they were. The group was closing in on me fast. I turned and ran across the back of the room to the back of the 5th aisle, but they just spread out. I took my chances running down the hall towards the stage.

When I made it to the railing, I jumped it; those things were getting closer. Running onto the stage, that woman turned and looked at me, yet didn't move, just stared. I turned and ran into the backstage area. Those things were getting closer, but there was an open door at the end of the hall. Running in, the door slammed behind me. Then those things started beating on the door. This was probably it; there was no way out. I started looking through the room, trying to find a way out. There was a clothing rack, and I practically knocked the thing down trying to see what was behind it. There was a very large vent. I knew that crawling through a vent was dangerous; I would probably get cut up and not really get anywhere. However, I would take my chances with the interior of the vent then whatever was outside that door.

It was strange because it seemed like it had been set up; the thing was already half off its frame. I was able to squeeze through. I wasn't going to tear it off and risk those things following me. Inside, it all almost felt too perfect. There were no sharp edges, nothing that was stopping me, and the tunnel wasn't heating up. 

It took about twenty minutes before I got to a different vent ending. Busting it open, I climbed out, and it seemed like I was in a security office. That's where I found this phone; it's not normal, it will open apps, but anywhere the time is meant to be, it's just an infinite symbol. The phone also seems connected to the place's Camera system. I could flip through them when I got to the camera that showed the stage; there was a bed there now with two figures on it. The woman was pacing around the bed. Then she stopped and slowly looked at the Camera. It was like she was talking; however, it felt like it was in my head. "Don't be afraid, darling, please, come back, the kids won't bite, and I'm sure you want to see your friends." It felt like it could be condescending, like she was talking to a toddler, but that's not what it felt like to me.

It sounded inviting and warm, like something my Mother would have said to calm me or Nate down when we were kids. I slowly creaked open the door of the security office, and there was a sign that was just an arrow pointing me to the left. I decided to follow it; there was another that pointed for me to go right. There were more of the signs as I walked through the building. It seemed impossible large. However, I finally made it to what must have been an entrance to the stage as I walked up, the Woman was waiting and waving, she seemed so friendly and inviting. For a moment, my vision flickered. I could have sworn my Mother was standing there, not whatever that woman was. 

She gestured for me to walk up. "Come on, darling, I promise all the kids from earlier won't attack you, I've told them to treat you as a friend." 

Slowly, I crossed onto the stage, that group of things with the light red skin, and talons were back to sitting at the edge of the seats. Except they were facing the stage. My vision flickered again, and it looked like the entire auditorium was covered in blood. However, it was back to normal in less than a second. The woman gestured at me. "Dear, welcome, I've been waiting for you. Your Brother has been waiting for you." 

She smiled at me. It was the type of smile that the attendant in the lobby had when we first got here. I didn't want to look at what was going on on the bed. There was this terrible sense of dread that overcame me, but slowly I looked up. Tatiana and Nathan were rigid; Nathan was on top of Tatiana, not moving. I'm not sure if they were alive or even real. They looked like they had been sewn together at the mouth. Though that may have been because of a flicker in my vision. The rest of them was covered by a blanket I turned to look at the woman who was still smiling with that smile; however, it felt like it somehow had gotten bigger.

I started to stutter. "What-what's wrong with them?" was all I could manage. She smiled at me and then said in the most sickly-sweet tone I had ever heard. "Oh, dear, don't worry, they don't know what's going on. They don't even feel anything."

I had gathered the ability to form a more complete sentence. "How did you get them like this? Nate would never do this." Tears had started to drench my cheeks. The woman, she wasn't even a woman, that thing's face contorted into what I think was her imitation of concern. "Oh, I was just trying to make you happy, dear. Isn't this what you wanted?"

I started to take a few steps backward. She raised a hand. "No, let's fix this." She waved her hand, and Nathan and Tatiana were not lying on the bed anymore. Tatiana was on the floor. Nate was propped against the bed. Their eyes looked foggy, they still weren't moving, and they still looked rigid. "Is this better dear?" 

I turned around and started trying to run back into the depths of the building. All the concern and care that had been in that thing's voice was gone. "Get him, drag him back here."

There was this door open at the end of a hall, I must have been running for a few minutes. The sound of those things chasing me was all I could hear. When I ran through the door, I just started falling. There was nothing through the door, just empty space, until I hit the ground. I was honestly very surprised that I did hit the ground. I really thought I was just going to keep falling forever. However, when I hit the ground, it was like I was at an arcade from the eighties, one of the ones my parents would talk about. Going to when they were teenagers. There was no way this was actually real. There was no way there was an arcade underneath the biggest theater in America. 

I started looking around when a feeling of sinking dread overcame me. There was this snack counter, and I was able to hide under part of it, like a child hiding from the world under the sink. I started typing this post once I got under here, well, checking the cameras. It was quite surprising that the cameras I could see somehow included this arcade. It was about fifteen minutes ago when I heard footsteps. Checking the Camera it was her, that thing, whatever it is. It was pacing the arcade, before it decided to get onto a space and just keep watch. That's where it is right now, it's right above me waiting, watching, listening. 

I decided to check the Radio City Hall website, and there isn't a play called the Nine Circles anywhere on it. It says that tonight, a singer was supposed to perform at Radio City Hall. I keep thinking about what is happening to Nathan and Tatiana. And where are Mikie and Elijah? Part of me wishes Nathan was still here. He would know what to say. I really wish I had never bought these stupid tickets, it was supposed to be a fun night, but now I'm cowering under this counter, hoping whatever that thing is that is above me doesn't notice that I'm under here. I'll try to keep you all updated if I'm still alive in a few days.
