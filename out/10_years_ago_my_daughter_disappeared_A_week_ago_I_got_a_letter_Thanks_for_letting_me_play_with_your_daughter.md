 Notebook paper crinkled against my palm as I traced the lettering with my thumb. The shaky blue lines composed a barely legible sequence of words. Handwritten. *Amateur.* Crumpled scotch tape held a photo to the bottom of the page. The image depicted a single human hand on a steel table, bound at the wrist by a metal chain, fingers splayed wide. My new penpal had scrawled two words in red marker over the photo. “Tick Tock.” 

It was my daughter’s hand. I knew it in an instant. 

I never believed much in all that shit you hear parents say. About how much you’ll love your child after they're born, or that sixth sense some dads seem to have when their kids are in danger. It just hadn’t been my experience. But I tried. When Victoria was born, I pressed her to my skin the way the doctor said I should. I felt nothing. And no matter how much I tried, or how much I wanted to love her, I couldn’t. All I could think about was my work. So I wore a mask. But I think Jane, my wife, saw through it. 

I knew I wasn’t the greatest parent. But I learned a lot of things about myself when she went missing. And if anything “good” came out of that ordeal, it’s that I knew I loved her. And I would do anything to have her back. 

As I scanned the photo, I noticed not for one tiny detail. A smiley face drawn inside the “o” in the word tock. One eye was a dot, the other long and skinny. My heart surged into my throat.

A decade ago, a series of killings plagued my hometown. A few days after a young woman would go missing, the police would receive a note. Eight letters cut and pasted from magazines. Tick Tock, with a smiley face drawn into the “o” with the blood of the missing person. Once that happened, the police had five days. Each day, a new package would arrive with one of the victim’s fingers inside. After five days, the next package was her head. This sent the town, and Jane, into a full-blown panic. She wanted to move. I didn’t. I wanted to focus on my work. And no matter how much I told her that the killer wouldn’t target her, she wouldn’t listen. Then one day I came home from work and they were gone. Jane’s head showed up at the police station a week later. Victoria’s never did, thank God, but I could only assume the worst. 

It was too much to bear. I ended up moving halfway across the country to a small town in southern Oregon, near the coast. I abandoned everything. The house, my work, all of it. I found work working the fishing rigs and tried to move on. I kept to myself as much as possible. Whenever someone would ask about my past, I’d make something up. Ended up settling on an IT worker from Iowa that wanted something different. And I never once told a single soul about my life before. That’s how I knew it was real. Whoever killed Jane, whoever kidnapped Victoria, had found me. Stalked me. *Hunted* me. I didn’t intend on waiting for fingers to show up in my mailbox before I fought back. 

I snapped on a pair of latex gloves I had stashed in the cabinet under my kitchen sink. Leftovers from my old work. I always loved putting on the gloves. It was the one piece of that life I was too sentimental to leave behind. I grabbed a magnifying glass off my desk and set it next to me as I went to work, peeling the tape carefully from the page and separating it from the photo. I pinched the corners of the photo and laid it down in front of me as I grabbed my magnifying glass. I worked over Victoria’s hands first. Her skin was pristine. Pale. Beautiful. No marks anywhere. No blood on her fingernails. She hadn’t been fighting. The chain wrapped around her wrists was old and rusted, but her skin underneath was unbroken. No sores, no redness. That didn’t surprise me. Stockholm syndrome should have sunk its teeth into her mind years ago. But if that were true, why the chain? Why the dramatic display of captivity?

I moved my attention away from her hands and examined the blood stained photo when something caught my eye. I should have caught it sooner. Initials scratched into the surface. Small, but distinct. J.C., with a heart around it, scratched into the bottom corner of the table. 

Jane Carter. 

My wife. 

I tried to swallow my panic as a single question dug into my mind. Years ago, in my work, I liked to scratch the initials of my customers into the side of my table not so different from the one in that picture after our business concluded. It was a strange habit; I know. But my work was hard, so I kept them as a reminder of my success. And now the killer was mocking me with it. Telling me that table is where Jane died. And telling me they knew more about me than I ever knew. 

But I still couldn’t ignore the question still nagging my mind. In the very bottom of the photo, just at the edge of the picture, I could see a tiny piece of the skirt of the table, right where I would have marked the initials myself. I planted the magnifying glass on it. Initials. My initials. I could only see two. J.B. C.J. My handwriting. My table, in my house. Jane died in my basement. Right where Victoria was now. I screamed. 

I had five days, assuming the killer was kind enough to wait for shipping before lopping off fingers. It was at least a 48 hour drive to the rural Maine town across the country. More if the roads were bad along the way. I could get there in three or four if I pushed. I got in the car and drove for as long as I could, well into the night. I’d sleep in my car, getting maybe three or four hours before I was back on the road. Still, travel never goes as quickly as you’d like. Construction, road closures, bathroom and food breaks. 

I pulled up in front of my old house the morning of the fourth day, delirious from sleep deprivation. The house was in terrible shape. Shingles were missing from the roof, half of the gutter had fallen onto the lawn, and the front door was missing. Graffiti lined the walls of the house. I grabbed the knife I had stashed in the dash and stumbled out of my car. I pushed my half numb legs towards the entrance. I resisted calling for Victoria. I planted my hand on the inside of the door frame. Toppled furniture scattered about the room. I placed each step with care as I danced my way around the obstacles. The air was so still I thought my breath might give me away. I grasped my knife tight in my shaking hands as I slid my back against the wall and stepped into the bedroom. 

The bed had sunk in the middle. I slid myself towards the closed closet in the back of the room. I moved the knife up near my shoulder and readied myself to lunge at a moment’s notice as I grasped the handle to the closet. The rusted knob ached loudly when I twisted it. I cringed and swung the door open hard, my heart pounding in my ears. I slashed on instinct. Empty. 

I cleared each room the same way, with the same trembling paranoia. The bathroom. Victoria’s bedroom. The kitchen. Even the backyard. There was only one place left. The basement. I used to keep it locked from upstairs, but the handle was gone. The door groaned as I pushed it open. I took slow steps down the dark, narrow stairwell until I reached a steel door. In the top corner of the door, a dim red light attached to a camera eyed me. An electronic number padlock secured the door, the same I had installed 15 years ago. I pushed a shaky finger towards the buttons. 0-4-0-1. Click. The door swung open, revealing a dark, narrow hallway. 

I stepped forward. Motion sensor lights installed in the ceiling buzzed and flickered on. Blood stained items on hooks lined the walls. A hammer, a saw, sheers, and a lab coat at the end of the hall. Each step echoed as I approached the final wood door. As I drew closer, I noticed something nailed to the outside of the door. Fingers. Four. *I made it in time.* 

The door was ajar just enough to see a line of light peek out from behind it. I held the knife in front of me with both hands and took two deep breaths before kicking the door. It smacked against the wall as it swung open. Emotion swirled through me when I laid eyes on her. Ten years later. A grown adult. Hot tears welled in my eyes. My chin trembled as I tried to find words. She stood at the table, my table, with her back turned towards me. 

“Victoria!” I wasn’t sure if I was asking or telling or begging. Nothing felt real. She turned towards me. I saw her face. It was her. It was real. I dropped my weapon. 

“Hi, Daddy. You made it.” She smiled at me. I wept. She held a large, bloody butcher knife to her left hand, which was missing all but her index finger. “You’re just in time.” Before I could react, she shoved the blade down hard. I heard the bone snap as the blade swung down. She didn’t react, instead maintaining the same gentle smile, staring into my eyes. I didn’t know what to do. Part of me wanted to embrace her. Comfort her. Get her out of here. The other part wanted to run. 

She grabbed her severed finger from the table and shoved it into the breast pocket of her lab coat. “I’m glad you found me,” she said, still smiling. “I have a present for you.” Blood dribbled from her finger stubs and splattered onto the tiled floor as she walked over to a refrigerator in the back of the room. The same refrigerator I had used. Panic pushed into my throat. 

“Wait. Please, don’t open that.” I wanted to save her from my secret. But I knew she already knew. She flicked the door open, revealing three shelves lined with large mason jars filled with liquid. Her fingers between them, nails clinking against the glass until she came across one she had covered in gift wrapping. She grabbed it and walked over to me with easy strides, still smiling, and shoved it into my stunned hands. The wrapping said “world’s #1 dad.” 

“This one is special. I made it just for you.” I stared with horror at the jar in my hands. “Open it.” 

“Please don’t make me do this. I’m not like this anymore, please…” 

“Open it.” The words were stern. I stared at her with shame. Her smile widened. My hands shook as I dug a single finger into the wrapping. I peeled a strip off, revealing a familiar green liquid sloshing inside the jar. I peeled another, then another. Long red strands like tentacles made themselves visible through the gaps in the wrapping. My stomach churned. It had been over a decade since I had seen what I was about to see. I pleaded one last time. 

“Please…” She didn’t say a word. I peeled the rest of the paper off. Two human eyes. Beautiful, shining, familiar blue eyes, floating in the jar. 

“Say hi to Mom.” I was speechless. “I know how you liked them.” She took a step closer to me. I couldn’t look her in the face. “I did it just like you. I watched you so many times. It wasn’t hard. You’d never lock the door behind you. And you made the code too obvious. You remember what it is, right?” 

“Your birthday.” 

“My birthday, that’s right. How generous am I to be the one giving gifts today?” She giggled. “I memorized it. I’d sit in the back of the room, watching you work. Shears for the fingers, scalpel for the eyes, saw for the head. I didn’t understand it at first. It seemed so awful. So messy. And the screaming, god…” I could see it so clearly now. How sick everything I did was. Even how sick it was to make that door code my daughter’s birthday. 

“But it’s not just the screaming. It’s the way the neck sounds when the saw goes through it, which is so much harder than it looked, by the way. And the gurgles, and the rattles, and the gasps and burps. So much noise.” She reached inside her pocket and pulled out her severed finger, playing with it in her hands. 

“But I did it just like you. It took some practice, of course, but I finally got it down now. I’m sure it didn’t take you nearly as much practice to get it right. But I try, Daddy. I really do.” She took the bloody end of the finger and jammed it into my chest. 

“I’d even talk to them when you were away, you know. They’d beg me over and over to let them go. Just like Mom did.” She moved the finger like a pen, marking a bloody circle onto my shirt. “She was so confused, Daddy. Why didn’t you tell her about your art?” She finished the smiley face she was drawing on my chest in blood and took a step back to admire her work. 

“See? Just like yours.” She turned her attention to the jar still in my hands. “She had the prettiest eyes of them all, don’t you think? And now she’s with us forever.” She stepped back towards me and lifted my chin to meet her face. “Just like I will be.” 

A moment later, she had clamped her long, sharp nails into her eye. Blood squirted out between her fingers and splattered onto my face. She pushed hard. I heard the flesh rip. More blood. She couldn’t maintain her smile anymore. She screamed in pain as she made the last effort and pulled hard. A brief pop rang into the air, and I watched as her eye fell into her palm. Blood streamed down her cheek. She took a few sharp breaths, her remaining eye looking at her handiwork, before she turned her gaze back towards me. She smiled once more. “Your turn, Daddy.” 

She reached towards me. Her eye fell from her hand and splatted on the tile. I screamed and pushed her. She topped back to the floor, and I ran. Down the hall, up the stairs, and out the front door. I fumbled for the keys in my pockets as I stole looks back towards the front door. I grabbed them and flung myself into my car, not bothering to buckle before I had peeled away down the road. I stole one last glance in my mirror as the house faded out of sight. The last thing I saw was Victoria standing on the porch waving me goodbye. Smiling.

That was yesterday morning. I’ve decided I’m turning myself in once I post this. I’m reporting Victoria too. I went back a few hours later, and she was gone. I’m not the man I was. I see my sins. I don’t expect any of you to forgive me, but please. Help find Victoria. I don’t know where she went. She needs help. And please, if you see the smiley face, the one with the one long eye…[run.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldArchitect/comments/yv369y/thanks_for_being_here/)
