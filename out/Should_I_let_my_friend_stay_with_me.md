Five years ago, I sat at a table with Nate. At the time, he had a twinkle in his eye, a big smile on his face, and right when I was about to question why he called me here in the first place, he exclaimed;

"Jasmine! You have got to meet her - I swear she is the love of my life." I could sense his excitement across the table. 

"Hasn't it only been 2 dates so far?" I questioned. 

Nate was a successful data analyst, worked remotely, and had a lot going for him. Normally, he would be very picky with the women he chose to pursue, so this was completely out of the ordinary.

"You know those people that always light up a room? That's her - and she's incredibly down to earth. She's fit, actually wants to know more about the world, and she made the first move in asking me out on a date!" I could tell he was completely enamored with her, so I let him drone on about Jasmine for the rest of the time we were together. 

His suspicions of Jasmine being the love of his life were correct. Within 6 months, they were engaged, and then within a year they were married. After their engagement, I would check in on Nate occasionally, but after his marriage, he completely wiped his socials and was not responsive over text or call. 

I did not hear from Nate until last night. 

After a car accident, I had to go to the ER to make sure I had no serious complications. During the process of care, the nurse that was in charge of me, Alex, seemed shaken - but I didn't pay too much attention to it. It seemed as if she had a rough shift or was tired. Once I was waiting on my test results, she slightly closed the door to my area but there was a portion that was slightly open. Through that, I was able to eavesdrop on a conversation between Alex and another nurse. 

"One of my patients had burn marks and lacerations all over her body, her eyes were gouged out and tongue cut off, yet somehow she has managed to stay alive. I don't understand." Alex muttered. She was holding herself, as if to prevent cold chills from all over her body. 

"Is the patient unconscious?" The other nurse questioned. 

"When she was first brought in, she was trying to sit up and speak, likely in shock. But, I can't get her voice out of my head. It was as if she was trying to explain herself, but she started lashing out. For a moment, we were unable to hold her back, and she started to scream, even without a tongue, but worst of all, there was a sort of smile to her face?" Alex whispered. 

"A smile?" The other nurse was shocked.

"We had to sedate her. She's currently asleep and tied down. We are not sure what to do, we're trying to make sure the press doesn't get a hold of this story. We've assigned a social worker to the case by the chance this is a domestic violence issue, but I am not ready for this - I thought it'd be a quiet shift tonight." 

"What's the patient's name and room number? I can take care of her for a bit while you take a breather." 

"Jasmine, bed 6."  

My entire body went numb. 

I couldn't think of the implication - my brain did not allow me to. Here I was, sitting on a hospital bed after an accident - surely there was no way that was Nate's wife? It couldn't be. 

Shortly after, I was discharged. 

I live alone, and didn't tell anyone besides the insurance company that I was in an accident, largely because it was minor. But, I didn't expect any visitors, especially one waiting outside my door as I drove up the driveway to my house. 

It was Nate. He was asking for a place to stay. He said he's run into trouble. 

For now, I've offered to pay for a night in a hotel room under my name - but should I let him in my house? Could he be responsible for Jasmine's condition? Please help me.
