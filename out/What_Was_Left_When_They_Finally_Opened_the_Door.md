When I was a kid, my family friend, someone like an elder sister to me, told me a story. A story so dark, so unsettling, it haunted me for years. She said it happened in Baroda, India, at a medical college right next to her architecture college. It’s one of those stories you don’t forget, the kind that lodges itself deep in your mind and won’t let go.

this was back in the early 2000's. Back then, ragging was a brutal, merciless tradition. The seniors didn’t just haze the newcomers; they crushed them. But this time, they went beyond any cruelty I could have imagined.

A new girl arrived at the medical college, fresh out of high school, on her very first day, bright-eyed and nervous, carrying dreams and hope like any fresh student. The seniors saw her as just another target, “fresh meat” to torment. But instead of the usual hazing, they had a different, darker plan brewing.

For the whole day, they befriended her. They took her out, made her laugh, made her feel safe. They played the part of protectors, the ones who’d look out for her in this harsh new world. She let her guard down. By evening, she was comfortable, maybe even grateful.

But when night fell, the nightmare began.

The dorm rooms were single occupancy, with a peculiar design—a “meda,” (hindi word for attic) an attic-like storage space just above the room, separated by a partial wall that didn’t reach the ceiling. this is present in common Indian households, its used to store extra things. 

Unknown to the girl, the seniors had sneaked a dead body from the medical college’s lab into her room. Not hidden away. Not in a bag. Placed cold and lifeless, flat on the floor, just feet away from where she slept.

When she returned, the seniors trapped her inside. They pulled the power lines to her room, plunging it into absolute darkness. No light. No way out. They locked the door from outside, leaving her alone with the corpse in the suffocating silence.

She banged on the door, screamed, begged. But no one came.

The seniors had a rule—they were supposed to ensure she didn’t escape and then let her out eventually. But as hours passed, they forgot. They drifted off to sleep, leaving her trapped.

Inside that room, in the dead blackness, with the cold, rotting body inches away, the girl’s mind shattered.

Imagine hours alone in total darkness, the air thick and heavy. No sounds but your own ragged breathing, your heartbeat pounding in your ears. The faint, sickening smell of death growing stronger with each minute. The body beneath you—silent, lifeless, yet somehow… present.

Your mind begins to trick you.

Faint whispers? Shadows moving just out of sight? Cold fingers brushing your skin? The crushing weight of despair and terror pulling you deeper and deeper into yourself.

She clawed at the walls, clawed at her own skin, broke off her nails, banged her head. The fear became agony. The agony twisted into madness.

When the seniors finally remembered, the sun was rising. They rushed to the door and forced it open.

What they saw was incomprehensible.

The girl wasn’t on the floor anymore. Instead, she was crouched in the meda—the attic space above the room—her hair practically ripped out by herself, her clothes torn and smeared with blood—not from the body, but from her own frantic scratching.

Her eyes were hollow, sunken deep into her skull, staring without seeing. She didn’t speak. She didn’t react.

In her hands was a severed arm, torn from the dead body beneath her.

She was chewing on it.

Silently. Mechanically. Like something not human.

The room reeked of death and madness.

The police were called, but the college moved quickly to contain the scandal. The dorm was sealed shut, never assigned again. Media inquiries were quietly bought off. The girl was taken to a mental institution and vanished from everyone’s lives forever.

To this day, that dorm remains locked. an unspoken warning, a place where shadows linger and silence screams.
