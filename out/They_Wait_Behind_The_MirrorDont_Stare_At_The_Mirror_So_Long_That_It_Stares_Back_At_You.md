Part 1 (The Cracked Mirror) 

I’m not one to believe in supernatural things, but that was before it happened. I’m writing this because I need to get it out, and maybe, just maybe, someone will know what happened to me.

I moved into an old, rundown house a few months ago. The landlord was... odd. Thin, gaunt, with skin that seemed too tight for his bones. He never looked me in the eye when we spoke, only staring at my shoes as though he was counting something. I wasn’t really interested in any of that. The rent was cheap, and I didn’t care much about the history of the place.

The house had been empty for a while, but everything seemed fine at first. I unpacked my things, rearranged the furniture, and explored the rooms. Most of the house was standard—creaky floors, old wallpaper peeling at the corners—but one room stood out. The guest bedroom. It had this massive mirror on the wall. The mirror was the first thing I noticed when I entered the room—it was huge, almost floor-to-ceiling, and framed with dark, ornate wood. But the most unsettling thing about it was the crack.

A jagged line ran through the center, stretching from the top corner down to the bottom. It wasn’t like a normal crack, though. It was too precise. It almost seemed intentional, as though someone had carefully etched it into the glass.

I didn’t think much of it at first, but something about that mirror... something about it felt wrong.

A few days after I settled in, I started seeing things in the reflection. At first, it was subtle—shadows moving in the corner of the mirror, things out of place. I’d turn around, but nothing would be there. I thought it was my imagination, a product of fatigue or stress.

But then, I saw her.

It was late one night. I had been sitting in bed, reading, when I noticed a figure standing behind me in the mirror. At first, I thought it was my reflection, but then I realized the angle was all wrong. I wasn’t standing like that, my back wasn’t arched. And then, I saw her face.

She was staring at me from the reflection, her eyes wide, too wide, like they were stretched beyond what should have been human. Her mouth was open, but no sound came out. Just a deep, hollow void. I could feel her presence, like she was right behind me, breathing on my neck, but when I turned around—nothing. Nothing at all.

I jumped out of bed, heart racing, sweating. I went to the mirror and touched the cracked glass. It was cold. Too cold. My reflection was normal, but when I looked closer, I saw something in the crack. Something moving. A face.

I backed away, stumbling, and slammed the door shut. I couldn’t breathe. I could still feel her eyes on me, like she was still there, watching, waiting.

I thought I was losing my mind. I called the landlord the next day, hoping to ask about the mirror, but he never answered. I left several messages, but he never called back.

A week later, I noticed the cracks were getting worse. The line split further across the mirror, jagged and uneven. It was as though the mirror itself was... alive. And that’s when things started getting real.

I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of scraping. Like fingernails on glass. The sound was sharp and constant. I sat up in bed, my chest tight. The noise was coming from the guest bedroom.

I couldn’t resist. I had to go see.

When I opened the door, the mirror was alive. The crack had grown, jagged shards of glass seemed to pulse with an unnatural rhythm, like something was trying to crawl through. And there, in the reflection, was the figure. The woman. But this time, she wasn’t standing behind me. She was inside the mirror, staring directly at me with those unblinking, hollow eyes.

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move.

And then, she smiled.

It wasn’t a smile. It was a grotesque, stretching of her lips. Her teeth were sharp—too sharp. Her mouth opened wider, wider, until it was a gaping hole, and I felt something inside me, deep in my chest, pulling. Like the mirror was trying to drag me in. My heart raced, my pulse quickened. I wanted to scream, but my mouth wouldn’t open.

I was trapped.

I don’t know how long I stood there, frozen. I couldn’t look away. I couldn’t move. And then, through the reflection, I saw her reach out. Her hand was pressed against the glass, fingertips brushing against the surface, leaving deep grooves where her skin touched.

She was coming.

I ran. I don’t know how, but I made it out of the room, slamming the door behind me. I collapsed against the wall, gasping for air. My heart was pounding so hard, I thought it might burst. I couldn’t stop shaking.

I left the house the next morning, packed what I could, and never looked back. I tried to call the landlord again, but he never answered. The house is still there, standing empty. I’ve tried to forget it, tried to move on, but I can’t.

Because sometimes, when I close my eyes, I still see her reflection. I still hear the scraping. And I know she’s waiting.
