Have you ever been head over heels in love? I have and it did not go well.

I first met Sarah at an art class I was attending for college. She was perfect, silky brunette curls, almond brown eyes, and perfect coco butter colored skin. She sat down next to me before the art class began when people were still flooding in. Immediately I was flustered by her beauty, butterflies beating up my insides.

“Hey” I said in a shaky voice. 

“Hey” she said back her voice like music to my ears

We talked about our love for art for a solid 10 minutes before the teacher spoke up.

“You are here to discover your inner self. When you draw your inner self reflects onto the paper. This class will teach you how to figure out your inner self and the meanings of your drawings” the art teacher said in a wise tone.

I cringed a little at this, I always found this kind of stuff a little corny.

I guess I didn’t hide my cringing face very well because Sarah looked at me and giggled a bit.

The art class went on and by the end I had built up enough courage to ask Sarah out on a coffee date. She said yes and we went on our date.

After our first couple of dates I asked her to be my girlfriend and she agreed. We had a pretty stable relationship until one night.

That fateful night Sarah came home from work a little irritated. I didn’t pick up on the signs and asked her to make me a sandwich in a joking tone. She didn’t laugh though. She exploded at me. Screaming about how hard her day was and about how I was a rude ungrateful man. Me, taken aback by the situation, I asked her what I did wrong. She did not like this at all. She stepped closer to me and screamed in my face. As she screamed her eyes started bulging out of their sockets. Her face twisting with anger as hair grew all over her face. Her mouth dropped farther than any human jaw would allow and her canines sharpened as they stretched longer and longer. Her eyes turned red with anger as hair grew all throughout her body. Her body morphed into one of a huge wolf. She was transforming into a werewolf right in front of my eyes. 

I screamed as I got up and ran to the bedroom where the shotgun was located. I slammed the bedroom door behind me and frantically ran over to my closet and pulled out a shotgun. When suddenly I heard the loud screech of claws against my bedroom door. The door burst open and I shot right into the werewolf’s face. It screeched in pain and I shot again right in the werewolf’s heart. The werewolf slumped over and morphed back into my girlfriend. I fell down to my knees crying. “Oh god, what did I do?” I cried out. I cried on my knees for a while before I realized I had to get away.

I drove away from my house, I drove for hours trying to clear my head and process what I had done. I didn’t sleep that night. The morning after I turned myself in. I explained the story how I’m explaining it to you and they put me in a hold at the psych ward until they could confirm I had killed her. I was sentenced to 15 years in prison but I got out 5 years early on good behavior and them figuring I was mentally ill. As I'm writing this I’m one year out of prison. I don’t know what I saw that night but I know it wasn't Sarah.
