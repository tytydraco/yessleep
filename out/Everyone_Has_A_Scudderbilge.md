I was still very young in those days. I don't know if my mother knew I'd gone out--she was prone to a kind of pharmacological temporary amnesia come the dawn, and I saw her medications on the nightstand. 

I left in the woad blue quick of morning. Heavy mists still ghosting down the streets, gold and crimson and vermillion waves of fallen maple leaves or the leaves of half hollowed box elders, and through the fog I saw the toothless grimace of the baby boomer bungalows and garish two story gothic facades, and the antique wickerworks of ivy or wild grape wrapped full around slumbering stone gables, porches where copper bundles of drybone cornstalks leaned like dimwitted sentinels beside the squatting remnants of jack-o'-lanterns. It was probably seven AM. 

I remember gazing down the lane and seeing it there, crouched and pale and turned away. 

It was a creature. Naked. Humanoid. But not human--the proportions were all wrong, the limbs too long and the shoulders hunched strangely, almost batwing-like. 

But it was too far away, and when I saw it, it saw me. Stood, a giant of thing, and loped off weirdly with a cry. 

It was very quiet in my little corner of the city. I remember I stood there for a long time, just watching the place the creature had left empty. Then I decided to follow it.

I followed the sidewalk at first. Managed to catch glimpses of it as it dipped between organdy halls of fog. The big pines on the corner of Susan and St. Paul loomed over everything, watched ominously. 

At last I came to a strange little yard out front of a strange little bungalow house. Vines up every wall, like cobwebs on the windowpanes. The creature had loped through this yard, I'd watched it go, and when I saw that the front door was half open, saw the empty darkness inside, I knew I had to follow.

I followed.

I remember how everything changed when I got inside. How it was all dim gray light, the sickly slow misalignment of time, the way I felt as though I had to struggle through an invisible mire just to move. 

The house was empty. It was silent save the hum of electricity, of ancient wiring in these drab stucco walls. When I looked for portraits of the people who lived here, in the strange little bungalow house with the strange little yard, there were none; in many places I could make out the water stains where portraits used to hang, I saw frames without their photos, and I knew that I was too late for them.

In the den I saw an old TV set but on the thick bowled screen someone had stuck a yellow sticky note with the words scribbled in Sharpie, NO FOUND FOOTAGE OR LOST LITERATURE FROM THE MODS. 

I turned away, feeling seasick. It had already been a million years in this house. Maybe more. The light was blue gray in the windows.

Suddenly a voice. From upstairs--that dim and empty stairwell leading to a deeper darker room somewhere way up there, somewhere in the skies:

JOHN, OH PLEASE, WHERE ARE YOU. I'M SO SCARED IT'S COMING BACK FOR ME. OH PLEASE.

but there's no John here. I am not him. 

It's a woman's voice. Like she's sick, like my mother on a terrible binge.

I feel a dread wash over me I have never known before. I am still very young. I grip the banister, start climbing. I try to call out but my voice is so thick, my words drip off the tongue and don't come back to me. I want to shout to her. But instead a light flicks on behind me, so gold and warm and bright, so I turn back to look.

The kitchen, dim and empty a moment ago, is now awash in warm golden light. I can hear the tintinnabulation of hungry silverware. Children laughing. A man speaking.

When I walk in slow motion to peer inside, I see a family sitting down at the dinner table for a holiday meal. No one seems to be able to see me there watching them. They're a beautiful family. But there's someone missing, an empty seat--

Then I remember the creature. And I am frightened again.

Until I see the girl. She's my age, but I remember thinking she was so pretty. She's laughing and joking with her older sister and brother. Then she looks directly at me.

I realize she can see me.

Later on she slips away and tells me to come upstairs with her. I do. We go to her room, which is powder blue and bubblegum pink.

Am I... Your... Imaginary friend? I ask her. 

She has blue eyes and they flash when she speaks:

Yes. I think that's what you are.

Oh, I say. But my voice is still in slow motion. I feel very much like an imaginary friend. 

What... What is the pale creature, I say. Always crouched and... turned away? 

She says, Oh that? It's a Scudderbilge. 

What's a... Scudderbilge?

Her eyes flash.

You don't know what a Scudderbilge is? Everyone has one. You know, you've got a mother, father, sister, brother, and Scudderbilge. 

It scares me... So bad.

That's what a Scudderbilge is supposed to do, she sighs. 

I stay with the girl for a long time. Weeks go by. I wait for her in her room while she goes to school. I don't go to school anymore. I don't go home anymore. Her name is Sparrow. 

One night, with the freezing November rain on the rooftops, I notice all the lights go out in the house. Sparrow suddenly seems frightened. She lays next to me and whispers, 

Shhh. It's back. Don't say anything, don't make any sound.

We can its low gutteral murmurs, hear its sudden wails below. We hear it smashing things in the kitchen. We hear it tearing up the furniture. My heart is hammering in my ribcage.

Then it's at the bottom of the stairs. It growls.

I hate it, I hate it, she hisses. Oh no oh no oh no. Please no. 

I won't let it... Hurt you, I say. I rise from her waterbed. The shadows are blue and gray and I feel like the floor is the pitching deck of a ship. It's very quiet, save for the freezing rain on the rooftops. 

I am overwhelmed with terror as I descend the stairs. It's so dark and empty in the house. It hasn't been this empty in so long. 

When I reach the bottom step and look out the creature is gone. Then I hear it in the other room, rummaging in the kitchen. 

And now, from upstairs, there is the woman again:

JOHN, OH JOHN PLEASE HELP ME HEP ME--

drunkenly, her words broken and uncanny

HEP ME JOHN OH GOD PLEASE--

and the creature, growing closer now, wailing and murmuring, I can feel its rage...

They found me three hours north of the city in a tiny town called Esterday. Someone brought me into the Motley police station and claimed they'd rescued me from a strange place they called the Cry House, just outside the tiny desolate town of Esterday. When they set out to confront these people, everyone in the house was long dead. 

These are things I was told. The police claim I was kidnapped and gone for three weeks. They also claimed the bodies of my captors had been decomposing for at least that long, but I wasn't questioned more on what occurred there, in the Cry House.

I tried to go there, to Esterday. A few days ago. I finally felt ready. 

But when I came to the city limits, according to the GPS, there was nothing. There was no Cry House. No town at all.

It doesn't matter, because every night in my dreams, and they're realer than real, I am still there. In the dim empty bungalow house, with the strange little yard out front, way up in the darkened room with Sparrow, and every night the Scudderbilge takes another step closer, another step higher, and soon I will fall asleep to the creature there at the top of the landing, pale and crouched and turned away...

If anyone out there has any knowledge of this place, Esterday, please DM me. I don't understand how this place is on a map when it's not actually there?

Because I fear the Scudderbilge, as I'm supposed to. 

As we all should.
