"Hello Reddit! I(36M) am a newly single father, as my dearest wife had passed away. I am here to ask for help, for I am concerned for my daughter 
(15F). 

She recently started to behave how my wife usually behaves. Slowly, she changed her ways of walking, talking, doing chores, heck when she sometimes cooks, the dishes taste exactly how my wife does it. 

I've asked relatives, other online strangers,  my brother, who is a therapist, and they've all said that it's her own way of coping and I should give her the time she needs to heal."

Relevant comments:

Commenter: "It can be her own little way of coping and grieving your wife's death, but it does seem weird on the "dish part". Does your wife keep any cooking recipe journal?"

OP: "Nope, she simply remembers the recipe."

UPDATE 1

"Not sure if this is the right place to update, but, here we go. As much as I want this update to be sunshine and rainbows, it isn't. Her condition became more severe. 

She's now slapping me so hard (so hard that it's leaving a deep red mark for hours) for no reason whatsoever and berates me constantly. Please help."

Relevant comments:

Commenter: "From your last post, you stated that she is starting to act like your wife. Was your wife abusive? If so, did your daughter witness her being abusive to you?"

OP: "I cannot discuss that."

Commenter: "You are purposely leaving out information. I feel there is more than what meets the eye."

SECOND UPDATE:

"First of all, thank you for the overwhelming amount of support I've received. I tried to do what you've all suggested, but none worked. She's now locking herself constantly in her room, screaming. 

I am not only worried for her, but because of her screaming, neighbors are now calling the police on me, suspecting I'm abusing her (though they were proven false immediately) . 

Please help."

Relevant comments:

Commenter: "So, you said she was behaving how your wife acted, right? Does your wife do this back then? Did she witness it? More importantly, if my first question is correct, what was the reason as to why she screamed?"

OP: "I cannot discuss this."

Commenter: "You've said this multiple times to comments that ask questions that are against you. You're hiding something, right?"

THIRD UPDATE

"I am here to answer questions and give an update. 
First, no, I am not abusive, no more questions about that. Second, she is not abusive. That's all. 

My daughter's condition worsened. She is now laying in bed, not moving an inch. If I try to move her, she'll return back to her bed by midnight. She looks so fucking lifeless I can't fucking take it anymore. I need someone to help me right now."

Relevant comments:

Commenter: "I'm not religious, but I fear some entity has possessed your daughter, and I believe the said entity is your deceased wife. That could explain why your daughter started to act the way your wife acts. Though, there's one question I have, and it's why your wife is torturing you and your daughter. Did something happen between you three?"

OP: "No. She is not possessed by any spirits, she is especially not possessed by my fucking wife. Do not fucking bring that topic up again."

Commenter: "gng u killed her br js admitðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­"

OP: "Fuck you."

FOURTH UPDATE:

"I can't fucking take it anymore. This shit has been overwhelming me. 

I killed my wife. 

Is that the answer you wanted? Are you fucking satisfied? Don't even fucking start in the comments  "You psychopath!", because I had good reason. 

One fucking night, a few fucking hours I spent with her bestfriend and suddenly I'm the evil one? Just because I want new experiences, suddenly I'm the villian? She can lock herself in our bedroom, doing whatever bullshit for a week, but I can't lock her in the basement for a day?

I've spent every fucking minute of my life in this family, I put a roof on top of our heads and food in our stomachs, and I can't even do shit."

Relevant comments:

Commenter: The fuck? You are not only deranged for killing your wife AND posting it online, but you expect us to side with you? You expect us to believe your reasons are good enough for you to kill her? What the fuck."

FINAL UPDATE:

"My daughter woke up one day, hysterical. I thought she was cured, but no. She started screaming at me that I "killed her mother" and was threatening to call the police if I ever laid one finger on her. 

I tried to calm her down, but nothing worked. So, I grabbed the nearby beer bottle, and smashed it onto her head, hoping it'll knock her out and, maybe, give her the time she needs to think straight. 

She is not waking up. It's been two days since the incident and she hasn't woken up. I don't want to call emergency services because I'll be in trouble. Please help."
