I noticed it yesterday morning. Alone in bed, I awoke to feeling constricted by the bedsheets I had wrapped and rolled in the dark hours before the sun crept between the cracks in the curtains. With a clammy palm, I reached for my phone to check the time. 4:34 am. In the distance, I could hear the shower running in the guest bathroom and a melodic humming of a mans voice. 

Tom, my live-in boyfriend of 4 years, had developed a habit of getting ready for work in the guest bathroom in an attempt to not disturb my sleep. It didn't really matter, though. Any time he got out of bed, it woke me up. Not from the movement or commotion, but the absence. I can always feel it.

 That's what must have woken me yesterday morning, was the absence. After I had checked the time, I went to place my phone back on the nightstand when something struck me. The light from my phone screen shown through my fingertips. At first, I thought maybe it was an optical illusion with it being so dark in the room and the phone screen being so bright. I immediately picked the phone back up and held my hand to it. Surely I was going crazy. As I held my hand to the screen drawing my eyes up my sillouhetted wrist and palm, slowly up to my fingers and there, peeping through soft outlines of what was my fingertips is Tom and I,  smiling back at me from my phones lock screen. I dropped my phone and rubbed my eyes, reaching for the lamp on my nightstand. As the switch from the lamp "clicked" on, so did the front door slam shut, giving me a start. He usually says goodbye. Brushing this thought aside, I stare down at my hands in the now well lit room. Just the tips of my fingers are completely transparent. 

I spent the better part of the day obsessing over this fact. I research on the internet only to find fictional stories of such an occurrence. I couldn't reach out to friends or even a doctor in fear of being locked up in the loony bin. That is to say, if I had any friends left since Tom and I got together. Seems like everyone makes excuses these days. Tom arrived back home just after 2 pm, and plopped into the well worn, 1990's-maroon armchair and popped on his headset for another game of war. He usually says hello. I've just finished up getting ready for my shift at the restaurant, a small family owned steakhouse. By now, the whole of my hands were nowhere to be seen, and although I could not see them, they shook violently as I attempted to apply a full face for the impending dinner service. I shuffle into the living room, where Tom loafed in front of the TV, thumbs clacking away on joysticks and buttons. I asked, loud enough for him to hear through his one headphone-less ear, "Do you notice anything different about me today?" Through the corner of his peripherals, he flashed a glance and responded with a quick "No". Surely, he would notice if my hands were transparent. Maybe I am going crazy. I kissed his cheek and tried not to get between him and the screen and left for work.

 Dinner service was busy. I fell into the crowd of pulsing motion, and the air was full of woo's and booze. No one seemed to notice my missing hands. I carried a tray of steaming steaks and crab legs over to my table, and as I'm setting the plate down, I almost dropped everything and set the plate down too hard in front of the guest. I apologize as I look on in awe straight through my forearms to the tabletop. I was now invisible up to my elbows. Still, no one noticed. I hurried back to the swinging doors to the kitchen, only to be slammed to the side by the door as another server rushed out the door with a sizzling tray of food. Wind knocked half out of me ,  I beelined for the employee bathroom in the back of the kitchen and locked myself in. I tried for a short while just to steady my breathing. Then the flood of thoughts came surging through, in a heated panic. Why am I even here? Does it even matter? Do I even matter? I open my eyes to see myself in the mirror, staring back at myself, only just now I can see my whole outline has gone hazy. I am leaving. I am going home. 

I get in the car and head straight home without telling anyone. No one calls. No one texts. I think to myself that it's unusual and then brushed the thought to the side. I'm disappearing. I come home to find Tom passed out in the armchair, headphones knocked to one side and snoring heavily. I need a hot shower. As I step into the shower and notice, I have no feet. I sat for an immeasurable amount of time under the hot water until it started to wane and run cold. I heaved myself into bed where I sat naked, staring deeply into where my body should be, but isn't. 

It's morning now. Tom never came to bed. Everything is so quiet. My body is completely gone now. I can see that my surroundings are starting to fade as well. The quiet is almost soothing.
