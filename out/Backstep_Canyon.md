In the unlikely event that you happen to hear an unfamiliar noise that captures your attention, we kindly request that you approach the situation with immediate caution. We suggest thoroughly investigating your basement or seeking assistance from a neighbor within your apartment building. Additionally, seeking guidance from a knowledgeable individual and maintaining a calm and tranquil environment might prove to be beneficial.

We kindly request that you remain composed and refrain from unnecessary displays of alarm as we have established protocols in place to ensure your safety. If feasible, identify any available objects that may serve as temporary tools and patiently await the arrival of the Federal Bureau of Universal Knowledge (F.B.U.K.) authorities, who will promptly locate you and initiate a secure evacuation procedure. Find solace in a secure area, such as below furniture or inside closets, and conceal yourself until the evacuation is successfully completed.

In the highly improbable occurrence that you encounter a Soul Eater (vanator magicae), it is of utmost importance to expeditiously flee in the opposite direction. Under no circumstances should you engage in combat with a Soul Eater. If unfortunately cornered by such a creature, assume a protective position and make a large amount to alert other individuals of the presence of the Soul Eater.

We sincerely appreciate your valuable time and attention.

Warm regards,

Sherron Lux
