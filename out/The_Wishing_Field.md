They say the field behind St. Agnes listens.

I used to laugh at that when I was young, like everyone else who left town and never returned. Thought it was just the kind of tale old women wove into their quilting bees and Wednesday prayer circles. But standing here now—knees in the cracked dirt, the air heavy with heat, and whispering corn stalks—I can’t quite remember why I ever stopped believing.

It hasn’t changed. Same rusted fence. Same wooden sign, burned with the words “Speak True.” Same scarecrow with a burlap face and stitched-on smile, arms out like it’s begging for a hug or a crucifixion.

I lower my head and whisper.

“I want her back,” I say. “Please.”

The corn doesn’t rustle. The wind doesn’t blow. But I feel it—like the field inhales. And something deep in the earth… agrees.



Her name was Anna. My wife. Dead seven months this week. Cancer got her fast—like the good ones always go. I tried to bargain with God then, too. Promised Him everything. Sobriety. Church. The savings account. Nothing worked.

But I remembered the Wishing Field. And I remembered that rule everyone knows, even if no one talks about it out loud:

If the field accepts your wish, you don’t go back. Not ever.

They never say what happens if you do.



A week passes, and strange things start creeping in.

First, it’s the dreams—Anna, standing barefoot in the corn. Her eyes are the same green I remember, but too wide, too clear. She opens her mouth to speak, and all I hear is rustling leaves.

Then it’s the call. My neighbor, Caleb, leaves a voicemail.

“Hey, uh… you didn’t plant anything out back, did you?”

I haven’t spoken to him in years. I don’t call back.

Then, two nights ago, I woke up to the smell of fresh soil and something sweet, like overripe peaches or a body left too long in the heat.

So today I go back.



The sky is gray like tin. The field is taller now—at least six feet high. Corn shouldn’t grow this fast, not in March. But this isn't corn. Not exactly.

I climb the fence. My foot lands in soft dirt that steams faintly against the cold morning air.

The stalks part for me.

At first, it’s just the usual: long green blades, thick stems, and golden tassels swaying gently. But then I see it—low to the ground, between two rows—something pale, bulging from a cob.

I kneel down.

It’s a mouth. Lips just like mine. Split in the middle. Glistening.

I jerk back and fall, and the corn trembles like it’s laughing.

I keep walking faster now, and they’re everywhere. Hands curling from husks. Teeth nestled in silken yellow. An eye stares at me from between leaves—gray-blue, like mine.

I stop when I see the scarecrow.

Except it’s not the same one.

Its shirt is mine—my old flannel from the garage. Its face isn’t burlap anymore.

It’s mine.

The stitched smile has turned into a twisted sneer, and its head lolls like it’s trying to speak.

“What is this?” I whisper. “What the hell is this?”

A breeze kicks up behind me. It smells like her perfume. Sweet, floral, a little old-fashioned.

“I gave you what you asked for,” a voice says. It’s Anna. But not. The tone’s wrong—like she’s talking through a drainpipe. “You weren’t supposed to come back.”

“I—I didn’t mean to. I just—”

I can’t finish the sentence. My mouth is dry. My legs are locked.

“You were granted,” she says. “You were fed. Now you feed us.”

The scarecrow's head lifts. Its eyes—my eyes—snap open.

And behind me, the field rustles louder.

Something brushes my shoulder.

I run.

Branches slap my face. Stalks try to grab me. I trip, I bleed, I scream—but I don’t stop. I don’t look back.

I clear the fence and hit the road hard, palms skinned, knees shaking. I don’t breathe until I’m back in my truck with the door slammed shut.

In the rearview mirror, the field waves gently. Innocent. Like it never meant me harm.

But tonight, I catch my reflection in the bathroom mirror, and a thin seam is across my cheek. Like skin peeled back and sewn again.

Tomorrow, I’ll find more. Maybe in my mouth. My eyes. My hands.

The Wishing Field always takes its payment. And it grows what it’s fed.

Even if it’s me.
