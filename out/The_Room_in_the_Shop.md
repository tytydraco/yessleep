This is everything I know about the room in the shop – the room I can remember so vividly, but only in parts. The room that didn’t fit, that didn’t belong. The room that didn’t make sense. I don’t know what else I can do but send out this warning:

Most of the year, I’m away from my hometown to attend university. My town is like many other small ones – waning, on the way out, years away from its peak. Many people leave, and few enter. The streets are lined with dilapidated shops, open and abandoned alike. There are dry water fountains, street clocks frozen in time, and broken-down playgrounds. Most business happens in the supermarkets and shopping centers of the nearby town. You get the idea.

On my last winter break, I came back home for the holidays. My older brother came into town to join the family too, and we all helped set up decorations. It felt great being together again after our busy lives had driven us apart. While setting up the Christmas tree, my mom plugged in the string lights to check if they worked, but no such luck. After lunch, I volunteered to drive her to the home goods store in town.

As I drove through town, I noticed a derelict store with a broken sign above displaying its name, *Baby Baby*. And that’s when the memory came back – a small room tucked away in the back of a consignment shop. Walls painted blue as the sky reached up to a tall, dark, unseeable ceiling above. Clouds dotted along the walls just above my young body. Toys and books scattered the floor, which was painted green as grass. A children’s table with two tables. The memory felt nostalgic, but also gut-wrenching. I collected myself and ignored a sense of foreboding to continue driving.

That night, I made some tea and went to the living room to sit with my mom. With a Christmas special playing on the television, I had a minute to think over what to ask. Then, I asked in a high voice that grew lower, “Did you ever bring me to the Baby Baby store in town? When I was a kid, I mean.”

She considered what I said, then pressed pause on the remote. My mom gave me a look mixed with concern and surprise, “Oh. What- what makes you ask?”

“I saw it when we were driving through town. All I could think of was this strange memory from that store.”

“*Baby Baby* was there before your father and I first moved here, but you were young when it was still open. Everyone thought it would close down sooner or later. But then, more and more people shopped there. You see, the shop had become popular among the town’s children. The owner set up a room for kids to play in while the adults shopped. It worked, kids loved it and dragged their parents to go. As a matter of fact, after we went the first time, you practically dragged me to keep going.

“About a year after things started looking up for *Baby Baby*, something happened. Three children went missing, a boy and two girls. The police were following any leads and noticed that all three children were friends and visited *Baby Baby* at least once a week. When they went to investigate the store, they found that it had been closed since the missing child reports first came in.

“The police received a warrant and searched the place. During the search, they discovered a painted-over door. The bodies of all three children were found inside, drained of most of their blood.

“Listen, I didn’t think you would remember anything from that store. It’s a good time for you to hear this though. You probably have questions, but that’s all I know,” she finished, looking at me with care.

My head, slightly spinning, lay against the back of the couch. More memories came to my mind as she told me what happened at the store. I remember begging my mom as a child to go to the store, once crying when I found out we weren’t going. One time, I was in the playroom with another child, but the room’s walls were painted like a jungle. Instead of a table with chairs, a small slide sat against the wall. There were stuffed animals everywhere – monkeys, leopards, tropical birds, and snakes.

At last, I asked my mom, “So, it was the owner who did it? Did they find him?”

“No. He just… disappeared. Not a trace of where he could’ve gone. The case remains open.”

“Thanks for telling me this, it’s helped make sense of some of my memories,” I concluded. But it hadn’t. Later that night, I did some extra research on what happened at *Baby Baby*. The moment the police broke inside the room, an overwhelming smell of rotting flesh had emerged – as if the smell had been trapped, waiting to be released, unable to waft through the walls. Pictures showed a room much smaller than I remembered. An adult would’ve had to bend over to avoid hitting their head on the ceiling. The walls weren’t decorated at all, and the floor was concrete with broken and dirty toys scattered about. Other than that, the story my mom had told me had been basically right. They never found the owner, and no one bought the building from the bank. So there it remains.

The rest of my time at home, I thought about the room, dreamt about the room. I could feel something pulling me to the room, to get more answers. Finally, after Christmas, on the night before my flight back to my university, I couldn’t take it anymore. I took a walk. Dressed in multiple layers, my coat, hat, and gloves, I pressed through the cold and snow towards town.

I followed a back street to the rear entrance of *Baby Baby*. I found the wooden backdoor in decay, with a padlock attached, long ago broken. I pushed the door open, and stepped inside to take a look around. The shelves, bookcases, and racks were empty – whether from the bank trying to make lost money back or kids breaking in for a laugh and taking what they please, I don’t know. As I walked about the deserted building, memories kept coming. I had been here more often than I could have even imagined. I remember searching for toys to bring to the room to play with, and later asking my mom to buy it, if I liked the toy. That’s right, the room. I could see it from where I stood, tucked in the corner of the shop in the back of the children’s section.

The room sat boarded up with wooden planks, wrapped with old, fading police tape. I peeled some of the tape away and peered between the boards to see into the room. It looked exactly as my online search led me to believe it looked. But now I felt a sense of familiarity with the room, even though it had never looked so small, so cramped as it did now.

I came back a couple of hours later with a deck wrecker. Before I did anything, I made sure that nobody was around the back or front of the store. Then I took my new tool and tore down the wooden boards. The entrance now wide open, I stood back for a moment to glance inside as another memory came to my mind.

The room had appeared like a treehouse the first time I brought my childhood best friend. With three kids we didn’t know, there were five of us inside. Then something strange happened. The door disappeared, and what felt like a rainstorm hit the room. On the other side of the wooden planks that lined the room’s walls were the sounds of rain splattering. The five of us were all scared and clumped together in the corner – it all felt so unreal, nonsensical. Then we noticed that a trapdoor had appeared in the center of the room. I left the others to check it, to see if it could lead us out of the room. When I opened it, I saw a ladder leading down into a basement chamber. The chamber had been smaller than the room appeared even now, but far deeper, and at the bottom was a figure cloaked in the shadows of that dark place. The figure seemed human-like, but withered and old, with only several strands of long, white hair remaining on its head, toothless as it smiled up at me. Its eyes were blind, but it knew I was there.

The thing at the bottom of the chamber said nothing, just smiled at me with its dead expression. All the same, I could feel a strong pull to go down there. And I did. I left the other four scared in the corner of the room and climbed down. Its eyes, though blank, looked at me with hunger as I descended. Before I could get to the bottom, its naked form leaped up and grabbed me. From that moment until the end, I never stopped screaming. It latched its mouth onto the skin of my arm with an impossible force. Toothless… that’s what I thought. But three blades inside the back of its mouth cut small slices into my skin, and it drank from my blood.

Why did this vivid memory only come back now, when I was here? I tried to remember what happened after the attack that day. When I crawled out of the trapdoor, the arm that had been sucked was left with only a Y-shaped scar. Once back in the room, the trapdoor into the basement chamber was gone, and the door to the rest of the store was back. Now that I’m back here – I can remember, but back then I had no memory of what happened in that chamber. As if whatever that creature was could make memories fade to conceal itself. What if it could hide itself in memories just as it could hide itself in rooms? As a kid, I forgot that thing beneath the trapdoor, and kept coming back to the store, to the room. Who could even say how many times it fed on me.

Finally, firmly back in the present, I entered the room. My eyes noticed the bare walls first, and then I saw it, the trapdoor in the middle of the room. Another memory: my best friend and I exploring the room. This time it looked like the inside of a medieval castle, and was far bigger than should be possible. I almost vomited as I recalled, for the first time, what I did that day all those years ago. You see, the creature had a strong pull on me after that first encounter. I could feel what it wanted, and felt obliged to help it. So I led my best friend through the child-sized hallways of the castle until we arrived at the entrance to the dungeons – a trapdoor. I opened the trapdoor nested in the floor and told him to go in, that everything would be okay, that this would be fun. He relented and agreed to go. I’m sorry. I was only a kid. I watched what it did to him, listened to his cries for help, but I didn’t feel scared or worried or afraid – I felt happy.

Now, with my head low against the ceiling, I stepped to the middle of the room, bent over, and pulled the trapdoor open. It looked exactly as I remembered it, but there was no creature inside. The flashlight on my phone revealed blood stains covering the floor and scratch marks along the walls. Seemingly random at first, the scratch marks actually patterned the different ways the room had appeared to me, and I suppose to others. The drawings were rudimentary, but resembled a grassy landscape, a jungle, a treehouse, and a castle, but also a house, a savannah, a pirate ship, and a cave. Some I couldn’t identify, others I didn’t want to.

I’m back at university now, which is for the best. In the time since I've come back, I’ve thought a lot about the room. Here’s what I think: that room wasn’t always there. At sometime, either with or without the owner’s knowledge, that thing moved into the old consignment store. It fed on children and used other children to help it. That has to be why the store was so popular among kids. Whatever a kid could imagine, the beast would make real in that room. Beyond their blood, it fed on their innocent fantasies. It took and shaped memories as it needed to stay concealed and firmly planted in our small town. Then, whether out of a need to hibernate or because of its ravenous hunger, it killed three children. But the creature isn’t there anymore, it left just as so many others have left our town. The store still sits there, an artifact of some supernatural infection from days long past.

All I can do now is send out this warning. Please reach out if you have memories of small places that shouldn’t be, that don’t fit. Then we could… I don’t know… track it down? I’m sorry I can’t do more.
