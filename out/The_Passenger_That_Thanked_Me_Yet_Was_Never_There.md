It was already late at night when I left work.
The job paid well—well enough that the one-hour drive from my small rural town to the factory didn’t bother me.
But today… today had drained me to the bone.

By the time I hit the highway, my eyelids felt like they were made of lead.
The only thing keeping me awake was the roar of my old pickup’s engine as I sped down the poorly lit asphalt, the beams of my headlights slicing through the darkness.

My eyes almost slipped shut—

Until I saw it.

A silhouette.
Standing at the side of the highway.
Waving.

I hesitated only a second before pulling over.

As my truck slowed, the figure stepped into the light—a woman, mid-twenties maybe.
Her clothes were soaked in blood.
Her whole body shook as if she’d been left out in the cold for hours.

Panic punched the breath out of me. I fumbled with the keys, trying to restart the engine, but she was already stumbling toward my window.

With trembling hands, I rolled it down.

“A-Are you o-okay?”

“M-My ex… p-please… help me…”

Her voice was jagged. Broken.
She was crying—really crying. And leaving her alone out here wasn’t an option.

I swallowed hard.
“Alright. Come with me.”

She slid into the seat beside me, her breath fast and shallow. Blood dripped quietly onto the rubber floor mat as I pulled back onto the highway, heading straight for the nearest clinic.

Neither of us spoke for a long while.

At some point I glanced over.
She forced a smile through the pain—small, grateful, heartbreaking.

When my eyes returned to the road, my stomach dropped.

A black Dodge was tailing us.
Way too close.

She stiffened instantly.

“No… no, no…”

“Who’s that?” I asked.

“My ex…”

I slammed my foot down, pushing the old engine harder than I ever had. It groaned, shuddered—and then, with a violent bang, it died.

We rolled to a stop on the empty stretch of highway.

“Stay here,” I said.

I leaned back, grabbing the shotgun my dad always kept behind the seats for hunting season. I loaded it, shoved extra shells into my pockets, and stepped outside.

“Back off!” I yelled into the night.

Then a blinding white light exploded across the road.

It wasn’t headlights.
It was a spotlight.

My heart stopped when I saw the markings.

Sheriff’s cruiser.

Confusion washed over me. I lowered the shotgun slowly, feeling stupid and scared all at once.

“I—I’m sorry,” I stammered. “I just wanted to help her.”

The deputy stepped out, holstering his weapon as he approached.
“Help who?”

“The… the girl in the passenger seat.”

He frowned.
“Son, there’s no one in your truck.”

Cold washed over me.
I ran to the passenger door, yanked it open—

Empty.

The blood was gone.
Completely gone.
The seat was spotless. Not a hair, not a wrinkle, not a single trace she’d ever existed.

Except for a small, yellow Post-it, stuck neatly to the dashboard.

“Thank you.”
