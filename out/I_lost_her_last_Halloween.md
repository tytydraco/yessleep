  
  
It started with a phone call last Halloween.  My girlfriend Susan made videos as a side job/hobby, and she’d had the idea for Halloween to walk the eight miles from her house to mine, recording the walk and any trick-or-treaters or decorations she saw along the way.  While there weren’t any real bad neighborhoods between us, I was still a bit worried about her traveling so far alone in the dark.  She shut me up by pointing out that kids did it every year without any problem, so she should be just fine without a big, strong man to protect her.  I still didn’t like the idea, but I kept it to myself after that.  
  
She was supposed to get to my house by around nine, and when I got the call from Susan at eight, I figured it was her saying she was running behind.  And I had some smart comment ready for her, but it went out of my head when I heard her on the other end of the line.  
  
“What’s wrong?  Are you okay?”  
  
“Um, no.  I don’t think so.  I don’t know.  I…I think I’m being followed.”  
  
“Followed?  By who?”  
  
“I don’t know.”  
  
“Um, okay.  Well, where are you?”  
  
“I’m about four miles away.  I…I’ve started taking more turns to keep on streets where there are more people, so it’s slowing me down.”  
  
“Do you want me to come get you?”  
  
“No, I’m walking fast now, so I’ll probably get there by the time you got your car off the back street and got down here and actually found me.  There’s tons of people out, so you wouldn’t be able to move fast.  Plus, I need…just stay there and I’ll explain, okay?”  
  
“Okay.  I…why do you think someone is following you?”  
  
A pause and then.  “I saw this guy in a costume a couple of miles back.  Nothing fancy, just a black ski mask like a knock-off Jason and a black hoodie and grey pants.  No kids or friends, just standing across the street looking a little creepy, which I mean, by itself is perfect for Halloween, right?”  
  
“Right, yeah.  But he started following you?”  
  
“I…I don’t know.  This all sounds stupid saying it, but I need your help, so I’m going to go ahead.”  
  
“Sure, tell me.  What happened?”  
  
“So I saw him across the street.  And he was low-key creepy, but that was it at first.  But then…then he turned and looked at me.  Like…noticed me.  And all of a sudden, my skin was all pricked up and I felt my heart beating faster.  I was really scared, even though he hadn’t done anything.  I was already recording him by that point, and having that feeling made me want to record him more, like…for proof or evidence or something.  I don’t know.  But then he started walking across the street toward me.  I…I panicked and started walking away faster.  I went half a block and then I looked back real quick.  He wasn’t behind me.”  
  
I frowned down at my phone.  “Um, okay.  So he’s not following you anymore?”  
  
“No, you don’t understand.  I thought the same thing at first.  I still had that same feeling, that scary feeling like when he first looked at me, but I thought it was just nerves.  I slowed down a little, took some breaths, and I even ran back the footage on my camera so I could see him again on the video.”  
  
“And?”  
  
Her voice started shaking more as she blurted out the next.  “He wasn’t there!”  
  
“Like, you didn’t record him like you’d thought?”  
  
“No!  I have the recording from across the street where he was standing.  There were these three little girls dressed up like Alvin and the Chipmunks or something and they were supercute, so they stood out.  He was like fifteen feet from them.  No way he wasn’t in the frame.  And that’s before I started focusing on him.”  
  
“Then what…”  
  
“It’s like he’s been erased from it.  I can’t see him on it anymore, even though I know he’s there.”  
  
“Sue, if this is some weird Halloween prank, it’s…”  
  
“Stop!  Please…stop.  I swear to God I’m not joking.  And I need you to listen to me before I run out of time.”  
  
“Run out of…Susan, if you think you’re in danger, I’m coming and you should call 911.”  
  
“I don’t think that will help.  I’ll explain, just let me talk and do what I ask, okay?”  
  
“Fuck…okay, tell me.”  
  
“Okay.  So I knew I had recorded him.  And I had the footage he should be in, but he wasn’t there anymore.  It really freaked me out.  I wondered if he had gone invisible somehow, but that was crazy, and I’d seen him through the camera, so how would he not show up on the recording of what I’d seen?  I almost called you then, but I thought I was overreacting, so instead I just ducked into a pharmacy for a few minutes.”  
  
“Did you watch to see if he followed you in?”  
  
“I did, yeah.  I’d gone down one of the aisles and stood watching the front of the store.  No one went in or out that I saw, and after a couple of minutes I was starting to think I’d either lost him or that I really was going crazy.  But that’s when it happened.”  
  
I felt my mouth going dry.  “What happened?”  
  
“The cashier.  Some little old man up front.  I saw him look up from his newspaper and stare at the front door.  He waved his hand and said ‘No masks in the store, please.  Thank you.’  Then he nodded and looked back down.  Jeremy, there was no one there.  I could see where he was looking, and I couldn’t see a person there.  I hadn’t seen the door open after I came in, I hadn’t heard the electronic door chime it made when I came through, nothing.  But he was talking to someone, could see someone, that I couldn’t see anymore.”  
  
“Wait.  So you’re saying this hockey mask guy has somehow gone invisible for you, but not for other people, and now he’s stalking you?”  
  
“I…I don’t think it’s invisible really.  It’s like I’m blind to him.  That’s why I can’t see him on the video either.  But I’m hoping that you can.”  
  
“Well, maybe.  I mean I can look when you get here, sure.  But are you sure you…”  
  
“Listen to me.  You don’t understand.  This video recording…I have it set up where it’s streaming to my private folder on my livestream platform.  I was going to go through and edit it in the morning and post it tomorrow, but that doesn’t help me now.  If I text you the address and login, can you get on and watch the footage?  See if you can see him?”  
  
“I mean, sure, I can.  But can’t we just do it when you get here?”  
  
“No.  I can…fuck, I can still feel his eyes on me.  I need to know where he’s at and how far away.  I need to know if he’s getting closer.  And if I run, if I’m running away from him or towards him.”  
  
A shiver went down my spine.  “Fuck this, I’m calling the cops.”  
  
“No!  No.  It won’t matter.  They won’t believe me and they won’t find me in time.  I need you to do this for me.  Please.”  
  
“Shit…um, yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Tell me what to do.”  I felt my phone buzz as a text came through.  “Is this the…okay, going and logging in now.”  
  
“Okay, great.  You’ve seen me post stuff before, but just…when you get into my account, go to private folder and then livestream.  It should be filled with videos in fifteen minute blocks at first, but then starting ten minutes ago, it’s going to be in thirty second blocks instead.  Just sort by upload time to get the right order.”  
  
“Give me a second…okay, I’m there.  Do I go to the most recent one?”  
  
“Yeah.  Click it and a player should pop up.”  
  
I did as she asked and a view of the street filled my screen.  I could hear Susan saying “…can still feel his eyes on me…” and I was about to tell her it was working when the camera panned behind her.  
  
“Oh God.”  
  
“What is it?  What do you see?  Do you see him?”  
  
I did.  He was probably thirty feet back, walking directly behind her just as she’d described—black hockey mask and hoodie above dark gray workpants.  “Yeah…he…fuck, yeah I see him and he’s still following you.  He’s right behind you back a little.”  
  
“Oh fuckfuckfuck.”  
  
“You really can’t see him?”  
  
“No, fuck me, I can’t.  I mean, that’s footage from like a minute or more ago, but I’ve been looking back every few seconds since I left the pharmacy.  But that’s what you need to remember.  I changed it to uploading every thirty seconds while we’ve been talking.  Reduced the quality and bitrate some too.  Each thirty seconds of footage should take about fifteen seconds to upload where you can see it, so I’ll only have about a minute delay between the recording and you telling me what you see.”  
  
“Yeah, okay, I’m clicking the new one that just popped up.  You’re walking by that pizza place that sucks on this one.”  
  
“Sure, I just did that a minute or two ago.  Still see him?”  
  
“Fuck!  Yes, he’s still back there.  I think he’s walking faster, but he’s still back the same amount.”  
  
“It’s because I’m walking faster.  Trying not to run because I don’t know if he can run me down, and I don’t know if anyone can help me if he does.”  
  
“What do you mean?  If he gets any closer, you should start screaming and scare him off until I can get there.”  
  
“Jeremy, think about it.  If he can make me not see him, what else can he do?  Who’s to say he can’t make himself invisible to everybody around us?  Maybe me too?  I don’t know what he is or what he can do, but now that I know you’ve seen him and its all real, I have to be smart about it.  If I can get to you and we lock the door, maybe he can’t follow and he’ll give up.”  
  
“Yeah, I can see what you…New one, looking now.”  
  
“Okay, I tried to spend more time pointed backwards this time, so…”  
  
“You need to speed up.  He’s closer now.  A lot closer.  You...I think you need to run.”  
  
“Jeremy, are you sure?  If I run he’ll know I know and he may…”  
  
“Run.  Please Sue, run.”  
  
No reply then, just the jostle and rustle of her arms and clothes moving as she broke into a run.  Her breath growing louder and more strained over the tiny mic in her earbuds.  She had probably three miles left to go, but she was in good shape and was fast.  She could do it, and I’d keep watching to help her.  
  
The next video popped, and I watched as the man grew even closer before the camera began to twist and jostle as Sue began running away from him.  Even though she was probably scared out of her mind, she remembered to keep turning her camera this way and that, though mainly she held it pointing backwards now.  I called out that he was still behind her, walking fast but not running, at least not yet.  
  
“Oh…kay…Keep…keep watching…”  
  
The next one, she did another pan, but it was too jerky and the light was worse on that stretch of street.  I caught a glimpse of him further back, but that was all.  
  
“Honey, I know it’s hard, but try to keep it back and steady.  I can’t see him much in that last one.”  
  
“Kay…will…”  
  
The next one started being smoother halfway through, and I had a happy moment where I thought he was gone for good.  But the street was thinning out as it grew later, and I could still distantly see the area I’d glimpsed in the last video.  He wasn’t there either.  So either he’d given up or…  
  
I tried to keep the terror out of my voice as I called to her.  “Sue, try to look around.  I don’t think he’s behind you anymore, but just make sure…”  
  
“Ahh!”  I heard a soft thud and grunt from the other end of the line.  
  
“Sue!  What’s happening?”  
  
“I…I’m okay.  I just hit something…It’s dark down here and…what did you say?”  
  
Hands shaking, I started heading out to the street to get my car.  “I…just look around with your camera sweetie.  I’ve got the videos pulled up on my phone now.  I’m coming to get you.”  
  
“No, I don’t want him to see you!  Just stay and I’ll come there and you can buzz me in.   I…oh God.  I can feel him looking at me.”  
  
“Sue!  Just run!”  
  
“I’m afraid.  I…I think he’s here with me.”  
  
“I’m coming!  Just run!”  
  
Jumping into my car, I cranked it as I hit the button to play the next video file.  The first few seconds were her still running with the camera pointed back, and then her hitting something and falling to the sidewalk.   
  
“Sue?  Are you there?”  
  
It was in the last seven seconds that she lifted the phone to look in front of her.  It was there, towering over her, draining all the light from the world.  I screamed her name again, but I got no reply.  
  
I never found her.  Neither did her family or the cops.  I gave them a copy of the videos of course, but they didn’t believe my statement and the videos by themselves weren’t much to go on.  I think they gave up on it within the first month, but I’ve held out hope and kept working to find her.   Most of that has been just rehashing that night.  Replaying the memories in my mind and watching all the footage she took both before and after he noticed her.  
  
I’ve always known it was real.  Some people, even her own brother, suggested that maybe she just bailed on her life like people sometimes do, or this is some harebrained scheme to get internet popularity.  Except none of the videos are on the internet, and it seems most people have just accepted that she’s gone, like it’s easier to have her taken from the world than accept there’s something like the thing that got her in it.  
  
But I’ve always known.  First, Sue wasn’t a liar, least of all to me.  And I heard how she sounded, both on the videos but on our call too.  She was terrified, and despite trying to help, I failed her.   That’s why I keep forcing myself to hope, and every week I take the time to go through the videos again, wishing that I’d finally see something different.  
  
Last night I finally did.    
  
I should have known it was coming, of course.  I’d felt my skin prickle two days ago, and there’s been an electric buzz in the back of my head ever since.  Sometimes it’s stronger or weaker, but it’s never left since it’s started.  But it wasn’t until I sat down after work yesterday to go back through the videos—my Sunday ritual—that I saw the change.  
  
The thing that took my girl from me last Halloween?
