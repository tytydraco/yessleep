In the few months I had been in Bonifacio Grove, I had barely filled my room with the detritus of daily life. That made it easy to pack everything I owned back into my two suitcases and lug those into the hallway. I nearly bumped into Elise as I descended the stairs; she squeaked and scurried back from our almost-collision, clutching the strap of her duffel bag tight as she did.

Her terrified eyes lifted to mine. I glanced at her luggage and nodded in silent understanding. There was nothing to be gained from us staying in a house that regurgitated corpse heads up its sink.

The first floor was a chaotic chorus: Charles and Leo cursed as they gathered their own things, Sam was on the landline calling the cops, Anika shouted prayers and rebukes in the kitchen—Dominic watched her from the hallway, arms crossed and a frown set deep on his face. He turned as Elise and I passed him. “Where are you two going?”

“Out,” I said. “We’re leaving.”

*“Wait!”* Charles yelped as he dashed out his unit, a bag in tow. Leo tripped into the open right after him. “I’m going with you, I’m not staying here.”

I nodded—it was good to see that everyone was keeping their common sense about them—then turned to Dominic: “You coming with?”

Dominic glowered. “All my money went into rent, I can’t afford to go anywhere right now.”

My earlier irritation returned—just briefly, before I clicked my tongue and forced myself to relax. If I let my frustration get the best of me, I’d be no better than Dominic and his caustic temperament. “I’ll pay for it. Get your stuff.”

The man blinked, then grinned and bolted to his room.

“Anika, Sam!” I called out. “Let’s go.”

*“I rebuke the spirit that has come upon the house!”* Anika shouted back instead. *“For I have been given the power to trample on snakes and scorpions, and to overcome the enemy. I won’t let this mockery of my faith drive me out.”*

I paused in surprise. Charles dragged a hand over his face. “Let’s just *go,* man, religious nuts like her never listen to people.”

“But—”

“We need to *get out of here.”* He grabbed my sleeve. “We don’t know when the next freaky thing is gonna happen—do you really want to risk being here a second longer than we have to?”

My mouth pinched. I didn’t know my housemates that well, so I hadn’t considered one of us would deliberately stay in a situation like this. Ideally, all of us should leave, but Charles was right. We didn’t have the time to convince Anika when things could get worse any second.

I swallowed my trepidation and headed for the living room. “Sam?”

Sam looked up from where he was bowed over the landline, one hand holding the phone to his ear, the other fidgeting with the cord. He smiled uneasily and pressed the phone to his shoulder so it wouldn’t pick up his voice. “I’m just calling people to sort this out,” he said; a strange thing to say, I hadn’t asked for justifications on what he was doing. Maybe it was a habit of his, to constantly explain himself. “I don’t think it’s anything supernatural, I think it’s just…”

“A fucking head appeared in our sink, man!” Leo sprinted to my side. “How the hell do you think that got there? You think it just got swept up the drain?”

Sam’s smiled faltered. His knuckles bleached white as his grip on the phone and cord tightened.

“It looks—” Leo choked up. “It looks like my dead brother…you can’t explain that—”

“No, it’s doesn’t,” Dominic cut in as he emerged from his room, backpack in hand. “It…” He clenched his jaw, hard enough that I could see the veins on his throat. He looked away and put a hand over his mouth. “It looks like my dad.”

“No?” Leo frowned. “It’s a kid’s head. How the hell does it look like your dad?”

“What are you two *talking about?”* Sam asked this time, eyes blown wide. His stare was on me, but it was glazed, distant. “It doesn’t look like some grown man, that’s my little cousin.”

…something was wrong. I turned to Elise, who stood at the end of the hallway and was twisting the hem of her sweater. She sported Dominic’s same queasy look, trembling so hard she looked like she was going to collapse at any moment.

“Elise,” I called gently. “What…what do you see in the sink?”

She drew her shoulders up. Bracing, I realized, much like I did whenever I expected to get hit. “…my mother,” she said. “What…what do *you* see?”

My lips flattened to a thin line. Then, after a moment: “My little sister.”

My dead little sister, who passed years and years ago and had to have a closed casket funeral, and who apparently appeared as other people to my housemates. Maybe it wasn’t her haunting me then, maybe this was something else, something that exhumed things from the depths of our pasts, things that made us pale and tremble and shake and look like we were about to be sick.

The realization seemed to hit the others at the same time it did me. Charles swore under his breath. Dominic ran a hand through his hair and hissed: “Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.”

“We *have* to get out of here,” Leo hissed, then turned to Sam. *“Now.”*

This time, the man didn’t protest. He put the phone down and nodded.

All six of us left the house and headed for the bus stop. All the streetlights surrounding the tiny shed were busted, and the nearby bakery was closed, so we had to turn on our phones’ flashlights to find our seats.

I sagged into the plastic chair as soon as I sat down. Despite my relative levelheadedness in leading the others out, there was still a weight between my eyes and a woozy, light-headed quality to my awareness. Now that the adrenaline was dying down, the discomfort shoved itself to the forefront of my mind. I hung my head between my knees.

At least the road was void of screeching cars. Nothing to worsen my headache. The lack of traffic was unusual for Manila—the city was even more congested than Cebu—but Bonifacio Grove’s highway had always been strangely barren. The only vehicles I had ever seen pass were the scheduled public transport. Most of the time, the street was abandoned.

“Ryan.” Elise shook my shoulder. “The bus is here.”

I looked up. Pale blue light washed over us as the bus doors hissed open. I squinted at the sudden brightness.

The six of us got up and boarded, with me climbing dead last. The bus was completely empty, so the others fanned out and grabbed seats at their leisure, not bothering to stick close—save for Elise, who snatched my arm and turned me around so I was facing her.

She motioned to her forehead. “Did you hit your head somewhere?”

I blinked. “What?”

“You’re bleeding.”

I reached up. My hand caught something sticky, warm, and wet between my eyes. When I pulled it back, my fingertips were stained.

In the bus interior’s sickly blue light, my blood looked black. I shakily scrubbed the rest of it off my brow, and wiped my hands clean on my jeans.

“It’s fine,” I lied. “I must have hit my head somewhere on our way out. We were in a hurry.”

The rain came shortly after the bus began its lonely glide out of Bonifacio Grove’s neighborhood. Since I sat at a window seat at the very back, I pulled my window closed before I could get drenched by the downpour. The others sitting scattered rows away from me did the same to theirs; Sam stood and closed the rest of the unused windows.

“What do you think it is?” Charles suddenly asked. Even with the white noise of the rainfall outside, his voice easily carried in the empty bus.

“What, the storm or something?” Sam asked as he returned to his seat. “It always rains here.”

“No, I meant…” I could only see the back of Charles’ head, but the slight crack in his voice gave away his fear. “The thing. In the sink. What do you think it is?”

For a minute or so, we only had the storm to fill the quiet. Then, Dominic huffed. “Some haunted bullshit.”

“Why do we all see different things, then?” Leo, sitting up front, angled his body so he was facing the rest of us. “I mean, Ryan’s seeing his sister, Sam’s seeing his cousin…if it was a ghost, you’d think we’d all see the same thing, ‘cause it’s stuck there and haunting the place.”

“What, you suddenly an expert on hauntings, now?” Dominic crossed his arms. “Didn’t know there was a canonized body of knowledge for the supernatural.”

Leo opened his mouth, paused, then tilted his head in a *Yeah, you have a point* gesture, and nodded in acquiescence.

“Us seeing different things’s probably got something to do with it, though, right? Whatever’s going on in that house.” Charles ducked his head and rubbed his nape. “Then again, we’ve got no idea what the hell was going on in there, anyway.”

“Maybe something’s tying them together, all the people we’re seeing.” Sam similarly turned in his seat to face everyone else. He had that empty, but friendly smile on his face again. That seemed to be his default state, constantly trying to look as harmless as possible. “Something they all have in common that…whatever’s happening is making them appear to us.”

Another awkward silence in the bus.

Dominic shifted in his seat. My, uh. My old man kicked the bucket last year.” A pause. “Had a stroke and fell off the balcony. Leo mentioned that his brother was dead too, so maybe that’s—you know.” He clicked his tongue, then slid his attention to Leo like he was waiting for him to back up that statement up.

“…my brother got shot when we were in high school,” Leo admitted, shoulders hiking up. “The cops were doing a drug raid around the neighborhood, and he was at the wrong place at the wrong time. They thought he was involved, tried to arrest him; he ran and…”

He trailed off and stayed quiet. Dominic grunted and turned to the rest of us, stare landing on me, then Elise, then Sam. It stayed there, and Sam’s smile twitched to something tense, before it wilted completely.

“It was an accident,” he said. “We were just kids. Her mom had to run back to the store real quick and told us to wait outside. This van suddenly swerved into the sidewalk and I got scared and jumped away, forgot to grab her with me ‘cause I got startled.”

My stomach dropped. Even before Elise said her piece, I already knew the image of her haunting would already be dead as well. I searched for where she sat ahead of me, and when our gazes met, her shoulders slumped. She wiped her eyes with the heel of her palm. “My mom died of lung cancer.”

“…my little sister passed too,” I said, quietly. “When our town got hit with a bad storm.”

“So we’re all seeing dead people.” Dominic nodded with another grunt and turned to our last member. “What’d you see, Charles? You didn’t mention it back at the house.”

In the brief moment I’d listened to the others, I’d looked away from Charles. His back was still to me, so I couldn’t see his face, but I could hear his quick and shallow breaths over the sound of the rain, and see the violent trembling of his shoulders.

Sam got up and approached him. “You alright, man?”

He made a noise, as if attempting to answer but failing miserably to do anything but croak out something strangled. His hands leapt and grabbed the back of the seat in front of him, nails digging into the foam.

*“Me,”* he wheezed out, after a long, shaking moment. “Me, I saw *me.* My dead face.”

He swayed to his feet—to do what, I didn’t know—but lost balance and listed sideways into the wall. His shoulder hit the metal surface, but he didn’t even grunt in pain.

“I’m *alive,”* he said, curling into himself like a dying insect. “I’m alive, I didn’t die in…in some horrible storm, or an accident, or got sick or…”

He straightened abruptly, then looked at each of us with a feverish terror in his eyes. “I’m alive—right?” he asked. The desperation in his voice made my own hands shake. “I’m not dead. This isn’t some fucked up afterlife I’m imagining. *Right?”*

“Of course.” Sam slowly neared him, hands held up. When Charles didn’t react, he placed his palms on the man’s shoulders and guided him back to his seat. “Of course you’re alive, Charles. Otherwise, we’d all be dead too.”

I swallowed and dug my nails into the meat of my hands. The cut of keratin against flesh hurt—as it should, because I was alive, I was real, I wasn’t some ghost blindly wandering, dreaming that it was still alive.

The others and I stopped by five inns before we found one with a vacancy. A singular one with two beds, but nobody protested when I suggested we all sleep at whatever spot we could snag. Even Dominic just grunted and followed everyone to the room.

Elise claimed the bed closest to the door, while Dominic claimed the other. Leo shot him a side-eye, but shook his head and picked a corner to place his luggage in. Sam and Charles chose random spots to sit on and stretch their legs. I nudged the door shut with my foot and—

—looked up to find myself back in the Bonifacio Grove’s living room. The corner where Leo put his things in was now the corner where the shelves met at an angle. Sam and Charles sat on liquor brown floorboards instead of the inn’s teal vinyl floormat. Elise laid on one of the couches while Dominic laid on another.

*“Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those that trespass against us,”* Anika’s voice droned from the kitchen. *“And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”*

In my periphery, Elise brought a hand to her mouth to muffle a sob.

*“For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory…”*

We marched out of the house to find someplace else to stay three more times. Each time, we reached an inn, got a room, piled inside—and the moment the door closed behind us, we were back in Bonifacio Grove. After the third time, none of us bothered to pick up our luggage. Instead, we all sat on the couches and exhaustedly spaced out. I picked a window to target my thousand-yard stare at.

I was halfway asleep when Anika ceased praying in the kitchen and graced the doorway. “The cops came by earlier to check Sam’s call. I pointed them to the sink.” Her lips pursed. “They couldn’t see the head.”

…shit. I tiredly turned to properly look at her. She had her arms crossed and her eyes narrowed at the floor.

“They couldn’t see anything at all. They yelled at me for calling them about an empty sink.” She dragged her glare back up at each of us. “I had to suffer through that since you were all afraid. It’s just demons playing tricks on us. Nothing to be scared of when you have faith.”

I’ve never been a religious man. That was more of my mother’s thing. She went to church every Sunday, brought her tithes, sat in Bible studies, and volunteered in outreach ministries. The night the doctor told her my father’s kidneys had failed and it wouldn’t be long until he died, she sat by his hospital bed and prayed for his miraculous healing until morning. The next day, she went home for an hour to rest, then returned and prayed some more.

*“It is moments like these when it is crucial that we have faith,”* she told me.

The day after that, Father died. She cried harder than I had ever seen her, harder than when Father beat her so bad she couldn’t see out of her left eye for weeks. I couldn’t tell if her grief was because her husband had died or because God didn’t answer her.

“I’m going to call my pastor tomorrow,” Anika said. “This isn’t something that can be solved by leaving the house or calling the cops. This is spiritual warfare.”

“Will he be able to help?” Leo croaked out; he was sprawled over one of the single-seaters, arm slung over his eyes. “Can he do an exorcism or something?”

Anika scowled. “Don’t mock the children of God, Leo.”

“I wasn’t…” The rest of Leo’s defense sank into the muddy fog of my fatigue. The world faded, the lights dimmed, sound vanished as sleep pulled me under and left me dead to the world.

I awoke in the middle of an empty, run-down church. A dusty, broken altar stood up ahead; faded stained glass windows loomed tall behind it—the sunset streaming through them painted the church interior in fiery swaths of red.

At the front, Eyeless Mary twirled and danced. The light above her stained the pale colors of her robes scarlet. “Ryan.” She smiled. “Dance with me, will you?”

I scrambled away from the illuminated parts of the floor, shoes skidding and squeaking from how fast I backed into the shadows. I was glad for their unnatural darkness for once. The moment I stepped into them, I lost sight of my own hands, my own feet. I seemed to blend into the black; if not for the fact that I could still see and blink, I would have thought I’d lost my body to the dark.

Mary abruptly stopped dancing. Her arms dropped like weights to her sides, and her chin thumped against her bloody collarbone. With her facing away from the light, her entire form was in silhouette. Pinpricks shone from the depths of her eye sockets.

*“Dance with me, boy!”* she barked, voice no longer gentle and delicate. It sounded scraped out of her throat, guttural and gravely. *“DANCE!”*

I turned to run—and ended up right at the front of the church with her. I backed away with a yelp, but Mary took my hands and laced out fingers together. She stepped to the side in the beginning of a waltz.

“That wasn’t so hard, was it?” she cooed while I tried to yank my hands away. Her grip was unshakeable. “Didn’t your mother ever teach you manners?”

“I’m not—” My feet slipped as she dragged me into a pivot, and I nearly faceplanted right into her gored-open chest. “I don’t even believe in you.”

“Yes, it was your dearest Papa who did.” Mary nodded. “I can hear him praying to me for help from Hell, you know?”

I reeled back in horror, as much as I could with my hands still in her hold. “What do you want from me?”

She finally let me go and lifted a bony finger toward the back of the church. I turned to see what she was pointing at, but as with my last dream, the shadows around me had somehow worsened, turned solid and inescapable.

“The water, Ryan,” Mary said. The sound of rushing water suddenly reached my ears, roaring when there had been silence before. “Have no faith, and it will destroy you; have blind faith, and it will consume you; nurture rage, and it will unmake you; nurture passivity, and it will crush you; run from it, and it will cage you; hide from it, and it will hide you.”

Slowly, dark water crept into the illuminated patches of the floor. It sloshed against the bottom of the church pews, flooded to where I stood until it wetted my sneakers.

Mary’s nails dug into my jaw. She wrenched me down so I was looking at her. “Do not drown.”

Then, she violently smashed her mouth against mine.

I screamed as the stench of decay assaulted my nose and rotting flesh pressed against my face—a mistake, as Mary parted her lips and vomited slimy, decaying blood down my throat. I coughed and beat my palms against her shoulders to push her away, but she remained immovable, and my thrashing only caused the blood to spill from my mouth and onto my shirt, my jeans, my shoes—



\-



I sat up from the couch I was sleeping on, eyes wide, sweat beading down my face. My mouth hurt and my throat burned; I could still feel the wet, slippery texture of half-coagulated blood sliding against my gums, could taste the sour rot of it on my tongue. I gagged.

“…you okay, man?”

I looked up, still breathing raggedly. Across from me, Leo was frozen hallway through bringing a mug of coffee to his lips.

“…yeah.” I lifted the collar of my shirt to wipe my face of sweat. “I’m fine. Just a bad dream.”

If Mary even was a dream. The human brain could conjure up the strangest things, awake or asleep, under pressure or free from it. Mary could be my subconscious trying to figure out an answer to the thing in the sink and the constant loop back to the house. Mary could just be the stress getting to me.

The thought was as convincing as my excuse to Elise when she found my head bleeding on the bus. This was something else, I just didn’t know what. And with how scared everyone already was, I didn’t know if I should tell them, especially when this seemed localized to me. Why burden them with something I could easily carry? Everyone was dealing with enough shit.

Leo and I stared at each other awkwardly for a minute or so. Eventually, the man cleared his throat and took a sip of his drink. “Anika says her pastor’s gonna be here at ten,” he said. “So, um…you got thirty minutes to look presentable for guests, I guess. If you care about that sort of thing.”

“Thirty…?” I looked to the clock mounted above the television. True to Leo’s word, it was half an hour to ten o’clock—less, with the minute hand already two minutes past six. “Shit.”

“Sorry.” Leo winced. “We let you sleep ‘cause you looked really out of it.”

“S’fine.” I reached up to try and massage the tightness building in my forehead. It didn’t work. I groaned. “Anything else I gotta know before my thirty minutes are up?”

“Elise left.” Leo motioned his mug to the doorway. “Four times, actually. Ended up right back here each time. She’s out for her fifth attempt, but I don’t think that’s gonna do her any good.” He dropped his mug back to his lap and traced the handle with his thumb. “This house really wants us here, for some reason.”

He stiffened, abruptly, like he’d just had cold water thrown on him and it’d shocked him awake. He took a long sip of his drink.

“Sorry.” He grimaced. “I don’t know why I said that. That made it sound like this place is alive.”
