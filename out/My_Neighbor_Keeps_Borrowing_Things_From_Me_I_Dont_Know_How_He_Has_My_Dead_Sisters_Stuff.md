When my sister Ally died last year, everything changed.

We’d been close our entire lives, and her sudden death—hit by a drunk driver while jogging—left a gaping hole in my chest. My family fell apart in different ways. My mom buried herself in photo albums, my dad stopped talking about her altogether, and I found myself drifting, stuck in a fog of grief.

I sold my apartment and moved into a quiet cul-de-sac to start fresh. It wasn’t much—a small rental house with a patchy yard—but it was quiet, peaceful. Exactly what I needed.

The first time I met my neighbor, Daniel, he seemed nice enough. He was in his early forties, well-dressed, polite. The kind of guy who smiled too much but offered to mow your lawn before you could judge him for it.

“Let me know if you ever need anything,” he said, handing me a box of cookies. “Welcome to the neighborhood.”

I didn’t think much about him until the borrowing started.

It was little things at first: a cup of sugar, a screwdriver, some duct tape. He’d knock on my door every few days with an easy grin, always apologizing for the bother.

“It’s no trouble,” I’d say, trying to be a good neighbor.

But then it got… weirder.

One day, he showed up asking for a book. I lent him one of my old paperbacks without thinking, but when he returned it, he asked for another.

“You’ve got great taste,” he said, scanning the shelf behind me. His eyes lingered on the titles. “I bet your sister did too.”

I froze.

“How do you know about my sister?” I asked.

His grin faltered for a second before snapping back into place. “You mentioned her once, didn’t you? Or maybe I saw the photos in your hallway.”

It felt off, but I let it slide.

A week later, he asked for a blanket.

“It’s for my dog,” he said, shifting on his porch. “She’s old, needs something soft for her joints.”

I handed him one of the older ones I had stuffed in my closet.

When he brought it back the next day, I noticed something strange. The stitching along the edge—it looked like Ally’s initials.

She used to embroider her name into her blankets when we were kids, a habit she carried into adulthood. This one looked just like hers.

But that wasn’t possible. I hadn’t brought Ally’s things with me when I moved. I’d boxed everything up and left it in storage.

I shook it off. Coincidence, I told myself.

Two nights later, I woke to a noise.

It was faint at first, just a dull thunk from somewhere outside. Half-asleep, I ignored it, but then it came again—louder this time.

I crept to the window and peeked out.

Daniel was standing in my backyard.

He was holding something—a photo frame—and staring at it under the moonlight.

My chest tightened as I recognized the frame. It was Ally’s. The same one I’d placed on my nightstand.

I stormed outside, barefoot and shaking. “What the hell are you doing?”

He didn’t flinch. His eyes met mine, cold and steady.

“I didn’t mean to wake you,” he said. His voice was calm, too calm.

“Why do you have that?” I demanded.

“I borrowed it,” he replied, as if it were obvious. “It belonged to her, didn’t it?”

My stomach dropped.

“What are you talking about?” I whispered.

He stepped closer, his smile returning. “She was so kind, wasn’t she? Always lending things to people. Just like you.”

I slammed the door and locked it, my hands trembling as I dialed the police. They came and took my statement, but when they searched his house, there was nothing there. No blanket, no books, no photo frame.

“Are you sure it wasn’t misplaced?” the officer asked, his tone skeptical.

I wanted to scream.

The next day, I went to my storage unit.

The boxes holding Ally’s belongings were open. Some were empty, others rummaged through. Her things were gone.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept checking the locks, pacing the house, replaying Daniel’s words in my head: She was kind. Always lending things. Just like you.

At 3 a.m., I heard footsteps outside my window.

Then came the knock—slow, deliberate.

When I finally worked up the courage to peek through the peephole, I saw a box sitting on the porch.

Inside was Ally’s necklace—the one she’d been wearing when she died.

The clasp was broken, the chain tarnished, but it was unmistakable.

Beneath it was a note, written in neat cursive:

“Thanks for letting me borrow her.”

My hands shook as I read it.

Borrow her?

The necklace slipped through my fingers, landing on the floor with a metallic clink.

That’s when I smelled it.

Faint but unmistakable—earth, damp and rotting.

And beneath it, something worse.

The lingering scent of Ally’s favorite perfume.
