The first time I saw the silhouette in the photo, goosebumps ran down my skin. It wasn’t the kind of fear when something jumps out of the darkness, not the panic before a cliff’s edge. This was different. It was a premonition of disaster. A terror as old as the darkness itself.  

We had ventured deep into the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, just ten miles from the Alberta border. This was the kind of place where satellite signals died, and the only sounds were the wind, the crunch of snow, and your own breath. Maps here were more of a suggestion than a guide. We had come under the pretense of elk hunting. At least, that’s what we told ourselves.  

There were four of us—me, Doug, Marcus, and Terry. And Doug’s dog, Cub—an old but sharp husky, sensitive as night-vision gear. We weren’t novices, just overconfident idiots. Years of hunting, survival, the silence of the woods behind us. We knew cold. We knew solitude. But we didn’t know we’d gone too far.  

The idea to set up trail cameras was Doug’s.  

"To track movement," he said.  

Mostly for elk, or so we thought. We mounted them along the trails, near water, on the ridges. Evenings were spent reviewing the footage by the fire, sipping whiskey and swapping stories. The hunting wasn’t great—just a couple of deer.  

But on the fourth day, something changed. One of the photos showed something… foreign.  

At first, we just stared in silence. A grain.

Black-and-white night shot. And yet—there it was. A figure. Large. Upright. Standing on two legs. Its back was turned, but its shoulders were broad, its posture hunched. Long arms, a massive torso. A tree stood nearby—giving us scale. At least eight feet tall. Needless to say, the hairs on my neck stood straight up. 
 
"Maybe a bear standing on its hind legs?" Terry muttered.  

"Bears don’t have proportions like that," Doug said, zooming in.  

Its head was conical. No neck. Arms nearly reaching its knees. Marcus didn’t say a word. He just stared, then whispered:  

"We go there tomorrow."

Looking back, I know now it was a terrible idea. But we were too sure of ourselves. And yet, that night, I didn’t sleep a wink. None of us did. Every sound outside felt alien—the snap of a branch, a gust of wind. The woods were no longer neutral.

They were watching.  

At dawn, we followed the trail. Snow fell softly, not fully covering the ground. And then we saw the tracks.  

They were enormous. Seventeen, maybe eighteen inches long. Flat, with distinct toes. Five toes. No claws.  

Doug crouched silently over one.  

"Definitely not a bear."

The tracks moved in a straight line. Too straight. The thing was heavy—deep imprints. It wasn’t wandering. It knew where it was going. Along the path, we found trees snapped at human height. Not fallen— broken. By hands.  

As we walked, I couldn’t shake the eerie feeling… like something was watching the back of my head. I’d turn—nothing. But the sensation never left. A chill ran down my spine when I asked the others—they all agreed. Something was following us.  

We stayed silent. Dusk thickened, and we decided to turn back. But the feeling of being watched never faded. Then came the sounds—a branch cracked to our left, and my heart nearly stopped. We raised our rifles, scanning the trees. Nothing.  
Back at camp, Cub wouldn’t calm down. He growled, whined, paced between the trees. We tried to soothe him, but he sensed what we couldn’t see.  

That night—something came close.  
Around 2 AM, we heard footsteps circling the tents. Snow crunched under heavy steps. Something breathed hoarsely. Doug flashed his light—nothing. Just trees. Just shadows. But the air smelled of wet fur and decay.  

By morning, one of the cameras was destroyed. The metal casing wasn’t bitten—it was crushed. By hands.  

Fear gripped us, but so did stubbornness. We didn’t turn back. God, we were idiots. Terry suggested trying to lure it—like Yeti researchers do. Knocking on wood, shouting. Marcus tried it: three strikes against a tree. A dull echo rolled through the slope.  

Thirty seconds later—three knocks in return.  
We froze. I couldn’t believe it was real, but those three answering knocks still haunt my nightmares.  
That night, I swear to God, I saw the silhouette among the trees. The same massive shape, watching us, blending with the snow. I blinked—it vanished, as if it had never been there.  

It was freezing, yet sweat beaded on my forehead. Paranoia clawed at me— we need to run. Something was circling camp. Snow fell from disturbed branches. No doubt—it was close.  
Cub broke free. His leash snapped—he bolted into the woods, barking with unnatural fury. We chased, but he was faster. His barks faded.  

Then came the roar.  

Not a bear’s. Something deeper, sharper, like years of rage finally unleashed. My ears rang from the primal scream, my heart hammering.  
We burst into a clearing. It stood at the far end—huge, shaggy, eyes reflecting our flashlights. And in its grip—Cub. Torn apart.  

Doug screamed and fired. The shot echoed, and the creature snarled—then vanished into the dark.  
We stood, rifles ready, hearts in our throats, as Cub’s blood soaked the snow.  

This was no longer a hunt. It was war. And now, no doubt remained: this was really a Yeti.  

At dawn, we packed—no cameras, no extra gear. Just guns. We followed its trail. It had killed Cub. Now we sought revenge. We might’ve looked confident, but we were terrified. Every one of us felt its gaze, making our bones tremble.  

The forest resisted. Snow thickened, visibility near zero. But we pressed on—what else was there? None of us could say "Let’s turn back," though we all wanted to.  

The first attack came at dusk.  

A log crashed down beside Marcus. Then another, nearly hitting me. They say your life flashes before your eyes when you face death. As that log flew past, I didn’t see my life—I saw my death. It would crush me, leave me suffering for minutes. But it missed.  

We scattered, firing blindly. Chaos—shouts, snapping branches, roars from all directions. Somehow, we broke free. Or so we thought.  
It chased us back to camp, hurling rocks and branches. The blizzard worsened—I could barely see. Yet… when the wind stilled for a second, I saw it—the Yeti, striding through trees, winding up to throw another rock. Snow blinded me again—then a scream. 
 
A rock hit Doug’s shoulder, knocking him down. The force was brutal—no doubt his shoulder was shattered. We dragged him back to camp, thinking the Yeti was gone.  

We were wrong.  

Camp was already destroyed. Tents shredded, supplies scattered. One rifle—snapped in half. Just like that. From the moment we saw it in that photo, we were never safe. It was the better hunter. 

We took turns sleeping. Cold seeped into our bones. Doug groaned in pain. Every forest sound frayed our nerves. By dawn, Terry was gone.  
We found him in the woods. Dragged through snow, bones broken, skull crushed. Done by hands. With force. With intent.  

Doug fell to his knees, sobbing. Marcus stood with his back to us, muttering. We had to leave. But we kept going.  

Every step was harder. Trees closed in. Light faded. The wind carried voices—sometimes Terry’s, sometimes Cub’s barks. Were we going mad? Or was something mocking us?  

Our food ran out as we hunted the monster. Doug worsened, unable to hold his rifle, but he kept walking, swearing revenge for Cub and Terry. I had no hope left.  

Twice, I turned—some primal instinct—but saw nothing. Yet I knew. It was near. Watching.  
And then we found it.  

Late afternoon, another clearing. It stood by a frozen stream, dipping its paw into an ice hole, washing its fur.  

We opened fire. Bullets struck—it jerked, roared, then charged.  

It was fast. Unnaturally fast. Doug was first. One hit—he flew into a tree. The crack of his spine. Marcus and I kept shooting, watching its white fur stain red.  

The Yeti grabbed Marcus’s head. Despite my terror, I rushed forward—and saw its face clearly for the first time.  

It was almost human. A massive lower jaw, slightly open, revealing jagged teeth. Then it looked at me. Straight into my eyes. A gaze I’ll never forget. Eyes full of hatred.  

I fired. Again. Again.  

It fell, writhing, making sounds like crying. Its eyes flooded with blood before its last breath.  

Then—a squeak.  

Behind the bushes, two small silhouettes. Shaggy, wide-eyed. Infants. 

It wasn’t hunting. It was protecting.

It didn’t kill for blood. It was saving its own.  
And we— we killed it.  

Doug wasn’t breathing. Marcus swayed, covered in blood. I stood, lowering my rifle, staring at the dead Yeti. I glanced at the two small shapes… and dropped my gun. Forever.

Now, as I write this in an abandoned ranger station—where the signal barely reaches—I keep thinking of that first photo. It was walking away from the camera. Not toward us. Not hunting. It was leaving.  

We came to hunt. And found what should’ve stayed a legend. It saw us as a threat.  

Now I see its eyes in my dreams. And the infants—in the bushes. They saw me. They remember.

One day, they’ll grow. And they’ll come for me—right to my doorstep.  

And I don’t know if I’ll fight back.
