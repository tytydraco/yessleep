I was a 30 year old woman and I had just lost my husband to a tragic accident. I was devastated and felt incredibly lonely in our empty home. I thought that getting a dog might help fill the void and provide some companionship.

I did some research and eventually found the perfect pup - a sweet and playful golden retriever. I named her Bella and brought her home. At first, everything seemed normal. Bella was a joyful and loving dog, always eager to play and cuddle with me.

However, after a few weeks, strange things started happening. Bella would often stare at me with a sad and mournful expression, as if she was trying to communicate something to me. She would also whine and pace around the house, as if she was agitated or distressed.

One night, I woke up to the sound of Bella barking and growling. I got out of bed and followed the noise to the living room, where I found Bella standing in front of a mirror, staring at her reflection with a fierce and menacing look in her eyes.

I was startled and confused, but I tried to calm Bella down and bring her back to bed. As I turned to leave the room, I caught a glimpse of my own reflection in the mirror. And that's when I saw it - the face of my husband, looking back at me with a sad and mournful expression.

I gasped and stumbled backwards, tripping over Bella and falling to the floor. I couldn't believe what I was seeing - was it really my husband, or was it just my imagination playing tricks on me? I was terrified and didn't know what to do.

In the end, I decided to get rid of Bella. I couldn't handle the strange and frightening events that seemed to be connected to her presence. I knew it wasn't fair to the dog, but I couldn't bear the thought of living with that constant reminder of my husband's death. I found a new home for Bella and tried to move on with my life, After I got rid of Bella, I thought things would return to normal. But I was wrong.

One night, I heard a loud crash and woke up to find that my bedroom window had been smashed. I was terrified and didn't know what to do. I fumbled for my phone and called the police, but before they arrived, I saw something moving outside the window.

It was Bella - or at least, it looked like Bella. But she was twice as big as before, with glowing eyes and sharp teeth bared. She was growling and snarling, and she seemed to be staring right at me.

I screamed and backed away from the window, but it was too late. Bella - or whatever it was - leaped through the broken window and charged at me. I tried to run, but my legs wouldn't move fast enough. I could hear the creature's hot breath on my neck as it chased me through the house.

I don't know how I managed to escape, but somehow I made it out of the house and into my car. I locked the doors and started the engine, speeding away as fast as I could. I didn't stop until I reached the police station, where I collapsed in tears and told them my story.

They didn't believe me at first, but when they went back to my house, they found evidence that something had indeed broken the window and chased me. They never found the creature, and I never went back to that house again.

I never learned the truth about what happened that night, but I knew one thing for certain - I never wanted to see Bella, or any other dog, again.
