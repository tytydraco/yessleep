I should have left that first night.

That’s what I keep telling myself now, every time I replay it in my head. I agreed to take the job no one else wanted. The job that brought me here, scribbling by the weak glow of my phone, while faint voices echo down the corridor.

The orphanage had been closed for nearly thirty years. The State shut it down after an “incident” everyone in town avoids mentioning. But it was never torn down. It just sat there, at the end of Willow Lane, collapsing into itself like a corpse nobody bothered to bury.

I was hired by a historical preservation group to act as caretaker, to keep squatters out, stop vandals from breaking windows, prevent any fires. Easy money, I thought. At least until I found out no one had lasted more than a week.

The first day was fine. Dust, broken furniture, peeling wallpaper. The place reeked of mold and rust. But the more I walked the halls, the more… wrong it felt. Like the air itself was heavy.

Then I found the toy room.

It was locked, but the old brass key still hung from a nail beside the door. Inside, the air was dry, stale — like a tomb. The walls were lined with shelves, and on them sat dozens of toys. Mostly dolls, but also stuffed animals, wooden horses, tin cars.

And they were pristine. Not dusty. Not faded. Just… waiting.

I remember thinking: someone must be taking care of these. Which was insane. No one had set foot in there for decades.

That night, while I tried to sleep in the caretaker’s room, I heard it. A whisper.

At first I thought it was just wind in the vents. But it grew clearer. Words. Children’s voices. I followed the sound down the corridor, until I was standing outside the toy room.

The whispers stopped. I don’t know why I went in. I should have turned back. But I opened the door. And every single toy moved.

The dolls on the shelves had turned, all facing me. The stuffed animals had toppled forward, glass eyes catching the moonlight through the cracked window.

I froze. Then one of the dolls opened its mouth. Not much. Just enough for a faint, dry voice to slip out:

“Don’t forget me.”

I told myself I was tired. Hallucinating. Stress, maybe mold in the walls. I didn’t tell anyone. I needed that job. But the toys didn’t stop.

Every night, the whispers returned. Sometimes words, sometimes laughter. They spoke names, dates, fragments of phrases.

“Liam fell in the well.”

“She locked us in the dark.”

“Don’t tell the headmistress.”

I started writing them down. Then came the dreams. I saw the orphanage alive again, children running through the halls, crying, laughing, fighting. I’d wake with their voices still echoing in my ears. Sometimes I saw their faces, just for a split second before I opened my eyes and they matched the toys. Exact replicas.

By the fifth night, I realized the whispers weren’t random. They were memories. I wasn’t just hearing voices. I was hearing what happened to them. On the seventh night, I made my mistake. I answered.

“I hear you,” I whispered to the toy room. “What do you want?”

Silence.

Then, all at once, every toy’s head tilted toward me. The sound of plastic and porcelain grinding like bones.

One doll, a boy in a patched jumpsuit, pushed himself up on stiff legs and staggered forward. His painted mouth moved.

“Set us free.”

The others began to chant. At first soft, then louder:

“Set us free. Set us free. Set us free.”

I slammed the door shut.

The next morning, I tried to quit. I called the number the preservation group had given me. It rang once, then dissolved into static. I tried again. Same thing. I sent an email. It bounced back.

That’s when I realized: I hadn’t seen a single soul since I arrived. No supervisor. No neighbors. No passing cars. It was as if the world outside had gone silent, leaving me trapped in the orphanage alone.

And the toys were getting bolder.

They no longer stayed in the toy room. I found them in the hallway, lined up neatly outside my door. A teddy bear sat on the stairs, staring at me. A porcelain girl waited in the bathroom mirror.

Wherever I turned, they were closer. And the whispers…they weren’t secrets anymore. They were commands.

“Pick me up.” 

“Hold my hand.”

“Look at me.”

The more I obeyed, the stronger they became. When I finally picked up one of the dolls, it breathed. I felt its tiny chest rise against my palm.

That’s when I finally understood. They weren’t toys. They were graves.

Each one was a child who had lived here, and died here, trapped inside their last belonging. Forgotten, just as they had always feared.

Last night, they showed me what “set us free” really means.

I woke to find them gathered around my bed. Dozens of them, their painted faces glowing in the moonlight. They climbed onto the mattress, their tiny cold hands pressing against my skin.

The boy in the patched jumpsuit crawled onto my chest. His porcelain mouth opened far too wide, and a black, smoke-like substance poured out. It reached for my mouth. My nose. My eyes.

And then I understood: they wanted bodies. Not to escape the orphanage. To wear us down. To live again.

I fought, thrashed, managed to tear them off me. I ran. But no matter where I went, they were there. Always waiting. Always whispering.

And tonight… they’re louder than ever.

I’m writing this in the office, door locked, phone nearly dead. But the whispers don’t stop.

Now they’re telling me things. Things they shouldn’t know. My secrets. My guilt. The mistakes I buried. They know everything. And they’ve promised me something.

If I let them in — if I give them my body — they’ll take the memories I can’t bear to keep. They’ll make me forget. They’ll set me free.

I want to say I won’t do it. That I’ll fight. That I’ll burn this place to the ground if I have to. But the truth? I’m so tired.

So if you find this, if you come looking for me at the orphanage, don’t open the toy room. Don’t listen to the whispers.

And if one of the dolls looks at you with my eyes…
