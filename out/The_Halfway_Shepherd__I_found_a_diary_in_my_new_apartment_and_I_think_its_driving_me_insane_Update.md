Hello all! After talking to my therapist, he thinks it's a good idea to catalogue what's been going on, "give your mind some space to breathe" as he put it. So, here I am, writing everything out so my brain feels less busy. If anyone is interested in what's been going on, I'll leave a link to my original post down below. I took some time to familiarize myself with the apartment and my neighborhood, looking for work and some friends. For only $700 a month in the city, it isn't too bad! I have a little corner store I can get groceries from,  a dog park I can go to, and I found a rec center I can hopefully make some friends! Things are looking up for sure, despite my parents breathing down my neck about grad school. As far as the weird diary I found, though, I hate to say it's been getting worse. I put it down for a few days after my random mindless reading episode, hoping I'd just forget about it. I immediately started feeling ill, though. Tossing and turning all night, stomachaches, the works. The worst was the tremors, though. The whole next few days after reading from it, I kept getting what felt like tiny electric jolts all the way through my body. I looked gray my mom told me, and nothing I was doing would make the sensations go away. I tried to sleep it off, and I think I slept something like 14 hours straight. You know when you wake up from a nap and you can't remember what year it is, where you are, that sort of feeling? I woke up with that. It sucked. My room still isn't really furnished yet either, so the creaky floorboards were sounded especially freaky. Nothing to soak up the sound I guess. I was definitely wigged out. It didn't help that the creepy diary was sitting on my bedside table too.

I really didn't want to read it, but not having many friends or family nearby has been a bit boring ya know? It was something to do, I guess, especially because I couldn't sleep anyway. So yeah, I read more of it, and you know what? I felt a little better.  I'm not much for horror writing, but it was like I was in the zone, like when I'm studying and feeling productive. I got to what I thought was a decent place to stop, just as the birds started chirping outside. I feel like at this point I'm more curious about it than I am spooked by it. But, more than anything, I am BEAT. I'll leave what I read again, mostly for me but also for anyone else interested haha. Gonna take a nap, hoping I'll be able to sleep better knowing I'm following my therapist's advice.

xoxo -- Mason

“P-Please, help me, I-I don’t know where–” 

I held my hand up impatiently, beads of his rose-colored mucus already dirtying more of my floor. To my surprise, he obeyed, his mouth clamping shut with a hollow thud, mustache twitching anxiously. I swallowed my annoyed sigh, lips pursed and brow furrowed at the Cats’ carelessness. Pinching the bridge of my nose, I tried to exhale the annoyance away, my free hand dancing swiftly through the air. A beautiful leather recliner sprang to attention from behind my desk, achy coils shaking themselves awake as it floated toward the man. I shambled toward my desk with effort, ducking under the chair as it descended awkwardly before its now-shrieking recipient. That haze of indifference lowered over me once more, the rhythmic thumping of my crutch grounding me for long enough to make it to my desk. I parked myself on a creaky wooden chair behind it, resting my crutch against the bookshelf robotically. The backpack collided with my desk in a muffled *PFFF*, a thin layer of dust creating streaks of light as my gaze shifted back to my first Overnighter. His squealing abruptly stopped, his mangled face settling on a silent scream as I gestured for him to sit. His bathrobe clung to his shoulders stiffly, a pungent mix of coffee and fresh cut grass releasing from his shirt as my recliner adjusted to his weight. His eye flitted about the room in discontent, his meaty, calloused hand anxiously whipping thin gray hairs out of his face. I wondered how long I could draw out the tension; like a delinquent schoolboy, the man sat in quiet anticipation, desperate to hear his punishment so the anxiety would leave him. Most who find themselves sitting in a pool of their own blood are much less still, let alone attentive. Despite his own eye socket drooling cherry red viscera, all he could muster in the moment were steady, stifled whimpers. I was almost impressed, the feeling lingering long enough for my phone to tear through the silence:

“Hello! Overnight Profile #1: 

Name: Albert “Al” Clancey

Age: 67 years, 5 months, 27 days

Nationality: American

Religion: Christian

COD: GSW to the Eye (L)”

*Coulda guessed that one, Phone.*

“P-Please,” he stammered, “I-I don’t know who you are, but I have to find my boy–”

I raised my hand once more, a huff of protest caught on his lips. “He’s here too. Somewhere, I’m sure,” I said in weak reassurance.

A flash of hope appeared for the Overnighter, his dread halted momentarily. His weathered rosy cheeks had smudges of dirt hiding beneath the blood, a choked sob echoing in the room. After a pregnant pause, I watched his face contort slowly, those same dirt smudges peeling free as a scowl morphed his face. 

“T-They had him by the throat,” he muttered weakly, his lone eye forcing out a steady stream of tears. “He was so scared–”

“They’re gone now, Al. You’re safe here. He is safe, too.” My eyes shifted unconsciously to the floor, a new pool of blood and pulp forming. 

“A-Are you sure? How can you know? I don’t even know who you are, I don’t know where I am, I-I-I don’t know where that random cat went–”

I shushed him for a third time, agitation mixing with his confusion like salt and water, threatening to boil over. “I can look him up,” I answered flatly, trying to coax his anger back. “Look, if I go here. . .”

I turned my phone to face him, my makeup hot against the office lights. I navigated through the scrawling list of names, Al’s eye desperately trying to process them all. It took a few minutes, but I instinctually paused over a name, Al’s face softening in response. 

“Profile Name: James Clancey

Would you like to Continue? ”

“No,” I said, my voice drifting into the room hoarsely.

Al’s shoulders relaxed, his mustache burying his mouth. His gaze shifted to me, a lone brown eye staring through me, glassy and thoughtless. As if ripped back to reality, his fingers raced up to his empty socket, delicately tracing the line of crimson down to his jawline. A new wave of fear pulled the color from his face once more, his already pallor skin taking on a new gray hue. 

“Wh-What happened to me?”

Despite the answer staring back at me from my phone, I gathered there was more to that question than just, “you got shot in the face, Al”. Tangling my leg with the chair’s legs, I leaned forward onto the backpack, my elbows digging into the faces within. 

“What do you remember?” I offered.

“J-James told me he’d be right back.” His lips retreated into his mouth once more, his tongue flicking moisture from his moustache onto the hardwood. “He. . . It was only a few minutes at most, I’m sure of it. Those damn Virmani twins, I kept telling him not to hang around that crew!” A curtain of anguish surrounded Al, a new batch of sobs ripped from his beet red face. “If only I wasn’t so damn sick! I’d’ve been able to actually do something! His deadbeat, sack of shit father was probably out stuffing coke up his nose again too, not like he cared about his boy at all.” He spat a glob of pink mucus onto my floor in indignation, the mere mention of the boy’s father seemingly rejected by his mouth.

I shifted in the chair, my leg twitching reflexively. *Almost there, Al*. 

He paused, eyes glassy and wet. “I h-heard. . . shouts. A gunshot. I remember being angry, sad, sick. I remember getting my robe caught on that fucking screen door Mark said he’d fix, the bastard. I-It was cold outside, oh God James was probably so cold. . .” A stifled sob escaped once more, Al wringing his hands as more blood pooled at his feet. “H-He looked so helpless in that Virmani boy’s hands. I-I didn’t know what to do, what could I have done? I tried to get help, I really did! When I turned to run back inside, though, my stomach started to hurt real. . . real bad. I heard another shot, and then. . . and then. . .”

A rush of bewilderment crossed his face, the clouds in his eyes parting as shock began to set in. “I-I don’t remember. Why can’t I remember?” His sweaty hand pushed hair from his forehead once more, gently trembling as he affixed it to his temple thoughtfully. Despite his shock, there was an air of ease about him now; a foreign sense of calm descended over him, as if his sudden amnesia stole the fear away with his memory.

“T-There was a cat I remember. I don’t remember where it came from, though. Oh god, my little Jimmy. . .” As quickly as the calm came, it vanished instantly, his face puckering in effort. Unable to delay the sadness any longer, Al scream-cried in the recliner freely, pink phlegm flying as he mourned his grandson. Grief has a strange sense of humor; sometimes, once you feel like you’ve gotten it all out, grief makes it sit, festering and underripe. Just when you think it's passed, that’s when it hits you, and it hits you hard. The pain, the fear, the sad, and sometimes even joy come avalanching out in a cesspool of disorganized emotion. Grief’s one of those things that is too foreign, too complex, too extravagant for the brain to handle all at once – hence the “Five Stages” and all that. Despite all of its intensity, its cruelty, its crushing weight, I couldn’t help but respect it. Chaos unlike anything imaginable, it had a surgical precision when it came to stripping away the soul. All you’re left with is a blank slate, nowhere else to look but straight ahead, into the future. Breathtaking. Predictably, I admired its ability to get the job done.

The numbness surrounding me held firm as Al belted out waves of heart wrenching wails, twinges of leg pain pulsing in time with his grief like a cruel metronome. The feeling anchored me once more, bits of stray mucus dotting my desk. A broken soul laid bare before me, steadily breathing cold life into this stagnant office, yet I’m cursed to be grief’s cruel accomplice. *I’m sorry Al, I really am. It’s time to move to the future, though.*

“You’ll have time to grieve Al, I promise,” I croaked, softening the cries lightly. “Unfortunately for both of us, however, we have to get you processed.”

A fresh sputter of frustration belted out from Al, stray mustache hairs releasing silently as he rocketed to his feet, hands slamming onto my desk. “You haven’t given me ONE straight answer since I’ve been here, while I’ve been dumping my entire life story for you. And for what?! I didn’t sign up for no fuckin’ therapy session; you’re gonna tell me who the fuck you are and where the fuck we are RIGHT. NOW.”

His face a few inches from mine, I could feel his hot breath and spittle spreading over my foundation, his burly hands smudging the pristine desktop in rage. “Alright Al, alright. You’re right. You and I both want nothing more than for you to leave and for me to never see you again, right? Then let’s get rolling okay?” I cleared my throat, Al’s knuckles relaxing ever so slightly. With apprehension, he released the desk, his flushed cheeks jiggling as he plopped back into the recliner. 

My eyes flutter closed for a moment, my composure shifting back to its typical, bureaucratic authority. “Do you, Albert Clancey, affirm that you died on September 19th at 23:17?”

Silence.

“Guess I thought my eye was just swollen shut. . .” Limply, he nodded.

“And do you, Albert Clancey, wish to pass on as a Christian?”

“Ain’t got any other choice, right?”

Silence.

“Y-Yes, I would.” 

“Last bit, I promise: would you, Albert Clancey, wish to pass on your life’s experience in order to shape future generations?” *Please say no.*

“As long as my boy’s alright like you say, it don’t matter.” His cheeks sagged morosely as he wheezed out the answer, the last bits of grief finally falling away. *Thank you, Al. I don’t think I could’ve started today with that*.

“Very well then. I have all I need from you; as of this moment, Albert Clancey, you are officially processed. Your patience and respect are duly noted.” My mouth felt dry, my lips already cracking from the overhead lights beating down. *Woof. One down*. Before either of us could relax, our fated interrogation concluded, my phone breached the silence yet again with an echoing buzz.

“Overnighter Albert “Al” Clancey: Complete!”

“Remaining: 138,205”

Blinking slowly, I covered my phone with the bag, silencing my all-too-cheery assistant. Lips drawn tightly, I motioned for Al to stand as his color slowly returned, his bloodstained cheeks taking on a warmer hue. *I wonder if they were that rosy in life*. I ushered him to the door cordially, a trail of his bloody footprints forming next to me as we shuffled to the far end of my office.

“Y-You’re takin’ me to see Jimmy, right?” Distress bubbling up inside him, Al looked like he was caught between reservation and candor, lingering bits of anger trying to strengthen his voice. I’ve been in the business long enough, though, and spoke through his facade.

“It isn’t up to me, Al. Either my Cats or Vivi will clean you up, fix your bleeding.” I apologized for the wounds, my crutch thumping noisily alongside our stroll. “If you go out these doors again, you’ll be escorted to Vivi. From there they’ll take care of you. Thanks again.”

“But is he safe, truly?”

I paused at the doors, their glass doorknobs shining eagerly. “Truly.”

Al’s demeanor finally shifted, a contentedness now emanating from him. It lasted long enough for me to motion for the door, a streak of panicked uncertainty welling up in him through shaky breaths. My office doors stood expectantly, the gold inlay slightly shimmering. His eye jumped between me and the doors, the sense of foreboding freezing him in place. With as much reassurance as this face could muster, I flashed him a hollow smile, my free hand feebly attempting to push the door open for him. I mouthed the word “magic” as the office doors creaked open, a gush of cold air escaping from behind them, threatening to knock me on my ass. My crutch catching me harshly, Al replaced my hand on the door, a similar smile cloaking his unease. He tested the cold with his leg, a ripple of frigid air subtly refreshing the stagnant office.

“T-Thanks for the, um, processing, I guess. Miss. . .”

“Mori,” I answered. “Just Mori.”
