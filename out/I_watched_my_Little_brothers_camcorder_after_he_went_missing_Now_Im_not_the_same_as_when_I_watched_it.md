Growing up in Guadalupe, I was never particularly fond of the big city. Everywhere I went, crowds followed me as if I were a celebrity. Waiting in lines, being forced to swim through crowds, it felt like hell. Luckily, 45 minutes away in Castle Creek was where my cousins, two male twins (Evan and Eli), lived in the forest. Every time we’d all go, it was like I had won the lottery. It was quiet, no long lines, and it felt like heaven. That fateful day, we went to their house so that my little brother, Jac, could film his 6th-grade movie project for school. 



When we pulled into the driveway, Jac had practically teleported into their house so they could film the movie in their backyard. They had me be the camera guy for about  30 minutes until I went inside to get them some orange juice, as I was also completely out of breath from following them, my hands trembling from the amount of running I had to do to follow them. As I was getting the juice out of the fridge, I heard a bloodcurdling scream.



I ran outside where they were, but they were nowhere to be found. I ran inside to tell my parents, and they were frantic. We searched everywhere on their 5-acre property, but they were nowhere to be found. Three weeks and an amber alert later, they were found mutilated at Soprano Valley State Park. The two nine-year-old boys were found disfigured so badly that I puked on the spot. My little brother was on a noose, hanging from a tree near a small creek. Let's just say I was traumatized by what happened to be the goriest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. They found the camcorder next to my little brother. I found the camcorder and decided to play it. 



It was very grainy, like those old VHS tapes my grandma used to make us watch at night. Their voices were playful and full of life. Then, the screen went dark, the same blood-curdling screech I heard while I got their drinks they never got to taste. The screen lit up, and I saw them running from something, their faces looking like they had seen hell. Then, it cut to a black screen again. The words “I can’t save them” flashed on the screen. Some eerie music started playing, sending chills down my spine. 



Then the video cuts to the face of a sorta humanoid creature, its shadowy figure scarred me for life. I then saw the two twins getting tortured, their screams of terror, their skulls being cracked open, this thing pulling their brains out. Picturing that made me throw up. All of a sudden, I see my little brother on the screen, his face slowly distorting while screams of terror run through the camcorder’s tiny speakers. It then cuts to my little brother, hanging there on a noose. 



To this day, I still get those haunting flashbacks from when I saw that video. These things give me so much trauma, I can’t watch a horror movie without leaving the room. I never wanna watch anything like that ever again.
