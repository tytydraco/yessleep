Ok, first, a bit of context: my uncle had a wife who died years ago in a fire.

Her name was **Beverley**.

The circumstances around her death were odd. Apparently she was meeting up with someone at the time. There had been whispers about a possible affair... Lots of people thought my uncle probably had something to do with the fire, but no one could prove it.

I never spent much time with Uncle Reid. He's always seemed a bit... *off* to me. Something in the eyes. A bit unhinged. Always watching...

Anyway, a few weeks ago, my uncle dies. I won't go into the details, but I will say he left a note. It basically said that he had enough of living with himself and the horrible thing he did. *Yeah*...

Ok, so, yesterday, I'm cleaning out his house to sell it. I'm moving an old cabinet and I see something poking out of a piece of broken plaster behind it. I pull at the plaster and it comes away easily. I find what's been hiding there: a file folder.

I open the file and inside I see a typed transcript from a recording. It said-

Actually, I think it'll be easier if I just copy it out for you. I really want to hear what you guys think about it. My mind has been reeling since I found it. I took a photo and sent over to the police, but now I am worried I made a mistake...

Here it is:

**CONFIDENTIAL**

**PROPERTY OF LANGLEY POLICE DEPARTMENT.** 

**Interviewee:** ***Unknown*** **(Un)**

**Interviewer: Detective Beverley Yang (DY)**

**Location: Jefferson Farm, Langley**

**Date: December 12th, 1993**

***Following material is a transcription of a recording pulled from Officer Yang’s personal recorder after it was recovered from the Jefferson Farm fire:***

*——*

**DY:** It is 3:46 am on December 12th 1993. This is Detective Yang. I am entering a warehouse on the abandoned Jeffrey Farm lot. I am with-

*(Un) No. Don’t say my name.*

**DY:** This won’t be shared with anyone outside my team. You have my word.

*(Un) I don’t know your team.* 

**DY:** You trust me, right?

*(Un) Of course.*

**DY:** You can trust them. 

*(Un) I just- I don’t want to be traced back to this. These people- (pause)*

**DY:** What is it?

(Un) *Did you hear that?* 

**DY:** What? 

(Un) *Over there.* 

*(pause)*

*(Sound of muffled banging in the background.)* 

*(Un)* *Oh, no, it’s ok. Just the wind hitting the door there.*

**DY:** Do you think you’re in danger? 

*(Un) (Sharp intake of breath) Just don’t say my name. Please, Bev.*

**DY:** Alright. I won’t. 

*(Un) This way.* 

**DY:** Why are you talking to me? If you think it is a risk?

*(Un) Because, what I saw here… it didn’t seem right. Someone needs to know. Someone has to look into it. Who better than you?* 

**DY:** What did you see? 

*(Un) I told you, I need to show you- You need to see this first. I don’t think you’ll believe me otherwise.*

*(Footsteps walking)*

*(Un) Sorry, I didn’t ask about Reid's mum. All this is- how’s she doing?*

**DY:** She’s… the doctors aren’t hopeful at this point. I just wish there was something we could do. 

*(Un) Yeah, same. Give my best to Reid. Ok, right over here.* 

*(Footsteps walking)*

**DY:** *Look.* 

**DY:** Oh my god. What is this? 

*(Un) I heard them call it The Aquarium.* 

**DY:** Who’s they?

*(Un) The people that were here. People in blue suits and in lab coats. They came first. With security for both. Armed. With big guns. The two groups shook hands. They were serious. Very business-like, you know. Some tension. But at the same time… I think there was some excitement too. That’s what they called it, this room, the aquarium, when they were inspecting it together. They wanted everything to be perfect.*

**DY:** The aquarium… For the record, I am looking at a large glass- *(sound of knocking on plastic)* Correction, a plastic box. A room. There are chairs positioned around it. Facing in. 

*(Un) The people took their seats there. On this side, the folks in blue suits, and on this side, the ones in the lab coats. Watching. Taking notes.*

**DY:** Watching what was happening inside? 

*(Un) Yes.* 

**DY:** For the record, the box, the aquarium, it has a door. There’s lock on the outside. Inside- it looks like it was set up for a fancy dinner. There are flowers all around the room. There’s a small table with table cloth. Place settings for two. Candles. Burnt down. There are some dinner plates with some food still left on it. Is that….?

*(Un) Blood. Yes.* 

**DY:** There’s blood on the table cloth, on part of the dinner plate. And… there is a blood soaked napkin on the floor. What happened? Who was inside?

*(Un) After they all sat down, a girl was brought in. Teen looking, maybe 18. She was wearing a nice dress. She looked dressed up. Ushered in by armed security and a man in a blue suit. She was put inside the box. The man spoke to her a bit in… I think it was Japanese. Not sure. They had microphones inside, see there. So people out here would hear inside. Then he left and locked the door behind him.*  

**DY:** Did she look scared?

*(Un) No. She looked excited. Then, a woman in a lab coat came in with a boy. He looked around the same age as the boy. Before he entered the room he stopped and spoke with the woman. It was in Hindi so I knew what they were saying. I was outside, there. See that crack?*

**DY:** Yeah.

*(Un) So I had a good view and could hear some of what was going on. The boy was telling her he wasn’t sure about this. She told him just to meet her and see how it goes. He nodded and squeezed her hand. She was maybe in her 70s, but… I don’t know. It was short, but there was something to that hand-squeeze. It looked intimate. The others, they wouldn’t have been able to see it. You could just see it from this angle. The woman opened the door for him and he went in. The door was locked behind. Everyone watching went quiet. They were all watching closely.* 

*(pause)*

*(Un) Did you just hear footsteps?!* 

**DY:** Hello? Is there anyone there? 

*(Pause)*

*(Un) No. I think I’m just nervous. Hearing things. Ok….where was I?*

**DY:** The boy had just got put in the aquarium. 

*(Un) The girl and the boy stared at each other for a bit. Then they shook hands. They said how great it was to finally meet. Almost unbelievable, the girl, Lin, said. They introduced themselves. The girl said she was Lin. The boy said he was Eric. Lin said that she had only ever heard him referred to as The Other One until then.* 

**DY:** *The Other One?*

*(Un) Yes. That’s what she said. Then they sat down to dinner and chatted a bit. They spoke mostly in English to each other. And a bit in Hindi and the other language. I really think it was Japanese, but I don’t want to give the wrong information. They both spoke perfectly. In English and Hindi at least. No accent or anything. They both mentioned that they didn’t get much opportunity to dress up. They both seemed smart, for teens, you know. The girl especially.* 

**DY:** How so? 

*(Un) Something in the way she spoke, and the way she carried herself. She seemed, they both seemed… different.* 

**DY:** *Different?*

*(Un) Odd. The girl seemed… intense. After a little, she poured wine for them both. She raised her glass and said “to us”. The boy raised his glass, but then pulled back. It looked like he was panicking. He said he couldn’t do this. He stood up and went to the door and called out a name, Helen. That’s when I saw the girl pick up her knife.* 

**DY:** *Her knife?*

*(Un) Yeah, her steak knife. While the boy was calling for Helen. Maybe Ellen. The woman, the one who brought him in, that must be here because she stood up for a moment, but then sat back down. She shook her head at him. The girl told the boy that their teams negotiated a strict non-intervention for this first meeting. She said it was a big deal. For them. I heard one of the women wearing a lab coat say “they will never understand how big”. The boy went back to the table and then- Does it seem quiet to you?* 

**DY*****:*** *Yes. The door’s stopped banging. The wind’s stopped.* 

*(Un) Oh. Yeah.* 

**DY*****:*** *And then the boy went back to the table-* 

*(Un) Yes. He sat down and apologized. Said it was a lot to take in. He said he thought Lin as lying until they showed him her files. The girl said she didn’t see any of his files. Then the boy asked her if they told her what they want. I could see some of the watchers look at each other. Nervous maybe. The girl said no one had told her anything. But she knows what they want. It’s obvious, she said. “They want us to fall in love.”*

**DY:** *So this was some kind of organized first date?* 

*(Un) Right. So then, the boy tells her that he can’t do that. He can’t fall in love with her. He loves someone else. Then, it happened so fast, the girl leapt across the table and jammed the knife into his throat. The boy looked confused. He pulled the knife out.*  

**DY:** That’s where the blood is from?

*(Un) Yes. It was horrible. It was spurting out, he was gurgling.*

**DY:** What did they do? The people watching?

*(Un) Nothing. Nothing. They just sat and watched. And took notes.*

**DY:** So they just watched him die? 

(Un) They watched… The girl just sat back and watched.

**DY:** What? That’s horrible. 

*(Un) The boy took the napkin and pressed it into his neck. Then he wiped the blood away. Wiped it away and… even from over there I could see. The wound was healing. It wasn’t a moment before it was gone. He used some water from his glass to clean up the rest of the blood from his neck. But he was healed.* 

**DY:** You’re telling me there was a boy in there that was stabbed in the neck and he just healed?

*(Un) Yes, I know it sounds- but it’s true. It’s true. I saw it happen.* 

**DY:** You sure you’re remembering things properly? Shock can do weird things.

(Un) *The boy was alright. He was stabbed through the neck. He was bleeding. It was bad, and then it wasn’t. He was perfectly fine.* *And I saw all these other people just watching taking notes. They didn’t look surprised at all. Slightly annoyed, but not surprised.* 

**DY:** *And how did the girl seem?* 

*(Un)* The girl smiled said “I had to see. To know for sure.”

**DY:** She knew that was going to happen? 

(Un) I don’t know. She said that it has been so long, she had given up hope she would meet someone like her. 

**DY:** Like her?

*(Un) Right. She said that she always thought if she met someone like her she would be happy. That she wouldn’t be alone. But suddenly she feels sad. That he has had to suffer like her. That he will have to. She looked out to the people watching and said “they want so badly what we have.” The boy said “They want us to have a child.”* 

**DY*****:*** *So that’s what these people are really after. A baby like them.*

*(Un) Yes, the girl said that they hope it will unlock their secrets. Then she looked at every one of the people gathered as she said: “They think immortality is a gift. But they don’t know they’re searching for a curse.”*

**DY:** Immortality. If they really are immortal then… Do you smell smoke? 

*(Un) Yeah, yeah, I do! There!*

**DY:** Get to the door. Quick! 

*(Un) It’s locked! Try the other.* 

**DY:** Locked. There’s someone outside! 

*(Un) Help! Please! We’re trapped in here.* 

*(Sound of gunshots)*

*(Un) Oh my god! It’s them.* 

**DY:** They’re getting rid of the evidence. 

*(Sound of gunshots)*

**DY:** We need to take cover. Now!

*(Sound of recorder falling)*

**DY:** Follow me! Into the aquarium! 

*(Sound of gunshots)*

*(Sounds of muffled voices)*

*———*

*Note: There were no bodies recovered from the fire. The whereabouts of Detective Yang and the unnamed source is still unknown at this time.* 

\--------------------------------------------------

So, what?!? What *is* this?!?

This is weird... right!?

I always thought Uncle Reid seemed off, but- well, of course he seemed unhinged, *right*? Of course he was always watching. He knew there was more to what happened to his wife and he was looking for the answer.

I have so. many. questions! How did my uncle find this file? Is Beverley even dead? And *IMMORTALS!?*

And the note Uncle Reid left- When my mum read it she said that she didn't believe her brother could've killed Bev. She was adamant. I thought it was denial. She didn't believe that he wrote the note.  She compared it to other things he had written. I thought the writing looked the same. But mum pointed out the swoop of the one "y" was different. At the time, I figured , you know, he was in a bad place, of course one "*y"* may be a bit different. But now... What if someone knew he had found this file? What if someone didn't want him to know about it?

When I handed the file over to the police, I wasn't thinking. Now I am! Now I'm thinking that was a mistake!

What do you think? Should I be worried?
