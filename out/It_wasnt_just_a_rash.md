It was one of those rare Saturdays that I had nothing going on. Though I wasn't much of an outdoorswoman, to fight the boredom of a long summer day inside, I went on a hike.

I say *hike,* but what I had planned was nothing more than a walk through the woods on the edge of town. Still, it gave me something to do.

Bag packed, I hopped into my car and parked near the trailhead I'd seen from the road countless times.

The warm air surrounded me as I stepped into the shade of the dense forest. I savored the forest air in deep breaths. The only sounds were the wind rustling the leaves and my own footsteps.

*The peace… the seclusion… I had made the right decision.*

*At least I thought.*

Despite being my first time hiking, the thrill of it all had me feeling adventurous. So when the trail passed alongside a glistening lake (that I never knew even existed), I did something very unlike myself.

I stripped down, folded my clothes neatly on a nearby log and waded into the water for a swim.

The sun was bright; the water startlingly cool.

I swam for maybe twenty minutes, drifting through the center of the lake until I felt I was pushing my luck. Surely, someone would see me before too long. I climbed out of the water and let the sun dry me off. I got dressed, and finished my hike.

I felt accomplished. Like maybe I'd become the sort of person who went hiking.

On my drive home, I noticed the rash for the first time: a red spot circled by inflammation, raised slightly, about the diameter of a quarter. It looked like a bite. I called it one, dismissed it as one, tried not to inspect it too much.

But the next morning, it was larger.

The red circle had widened to the size of a golf ball, slightly raised above the rest of my skin. Not itchy. Not painful. But impossible to forget. Over the next few days, my hand kept moving back to it—drawn there subconsciously, lingering on a growth that felt inert until—once or twice—it didn’t.

By the end of the week, the rash was nearly the size of a baseball. Darker red now, bulging, almost taut. And I would swear I felt it move.

That’s when I went to see Dr. Rodney.

He was a jolly man—unassuming, habitually kind, the sort of doctor you don't mind visiting. I believed he’d prescribe a cream and send me off with mild reassurance.

The face he made when he saw my leg indicated otherwise.

“Hmm,” he said, leaning in to inspect it more seriously. “Let me check something just to be sure.”

He returned with a device that resembled a magnifying glass. But where the "glass" would have been, there was a round screen.

When he swept it over my leg, he muttered a single word, low, almost to himself: “Corrid...”

Then he looked at me.

“Riley,” he said, and the jolliness was gone. “Have you been swimming in Gem Lake?”

I hadn’t known the name of the lake. But the fact that I was being asked told me I probably was.

“I went swimming in *a* lake last week,” I said.

“*RYNECORP* really needs to do something about that mess,” he muttered, pacing once in a tight circle. “You’ve been infected with a parasite called a Corrid.”

I looked down at my leg, at the swollen red membrane, trying to picture what was growing underneath.

“Can you get it out?” I asked.

He shook his head solemnly. “That’s part of the bad news. Corrids wrap themselves around important anatomy. They can do catastrophic damage when disturbed.”

He must have seen the terror in my expression, because he softened a bit, leaning in.

“Oh, but we *will* take care of it,” he said. “Here’s what I need you to do.”

And he told me the rules:

Pack your bathing suit in your car.

Do not shower. Do not enter any water whatsoever.

When you feel the *urge*—the pull toward a body of water so strong you can hardly resist it—that means the corrid is almost ready to emerge.

When that happens, call me immediately. Come here. No matter the hour.

I tried to ask more questions, but Dr. Rodney was light on answers. I think he was trying to protect me. But all it did was give me more to worry about in the days to come.

I tried looking up "Corrids" on the internet, but the search came up dry. Whatever was inside me, it wasn't common.

As if I could, I tried my best to live as normal in the days to come. But I spent an inordinate amount of time staring at the lump on my leg—which was taking on more revolting properties by the day.

Besides continuing to grow and moving much more regularly, I could now see a black mass pass across the surface of the lump every so often. It took everything within me not to cut the thing out myself. Almost anything would be better than remaining a home to this mysterious and revolting creature.

Though the days dragged, by Monday afternoon, I felt what Dr. Rodney said I would—the urge to get into a body of water. It came on subtly at first, but as soon as I detected it, I got changed into my bathing suit, hopped into my car and sped over to Dr. Rodney's office. But by the time I pulled into the parking lot, the urge was so severe that I almost plunged myself into the fountain in front of the building.

I didn't even stop to think twice about how strange I must have looked heading into a doctor's office in my bathing suit.

Dr. Rodney was waiting for me in the lobby and led me into a back room. There in the center of the white-tiled exam room was a large metal bathtub already filled with water.

"Get in," he said.

I didn't need the instruction. I don't think I could have lasted another moment outside that tub. The draw was so strong; I had never felt anything like it in my life.

"What do I do now?" I asked, turning to Dr. Rodney, but only in time to see the door slam behind him.

My heart skipped a beat.

"Hello?" I shouted.

But a small slot in the door opened, and Dr. Rodney's face appeared on the other side.

"I'm sorry, Riley," he said. "But there are certain liabilities that prevent me from being in the room with you. Contamination risks and… other dangers. But I'll be right here walking you through every step."

I wanted to argue. I wanted to jump out of the tub and bash open the door. But it's not like my body would even allow me to do that.

With a defeated sigh I said, "Fine. What do I do now?"

"The corrid will soon emerge. It releases a powerful anesthetic, so you won't feel a thing. But whatever you do, don't disturb it until it has full exited your body."

I did my best to remain calm. Deep breaths.

I felt the corrid moving rapidly inside me, but the lump remained sealed.

Soon, however, something began to poke at the apex of the mound on my thigh. The skin grew taught as something black pressed hard against it from inside.

It broke through, releasing a thin strand of blood into the water.

I shuddered and squirmed, but couldn't look away.

Soon a thin, black, wormlike appendage was slithering through the ever-widening wound. I grasped the edge of the tub in a desperate effort not to reach down and yank the thing out of me.

It just kept coming. Long, slimy and fluke-like, it wriggled out of my thigh with painstaking slowness.

My nerves were shot. I heaved deep, nervous breaths as my eyes were locked onto the thing emerging from my body.

It may have been two feet long, or longer, before the last of it slipped from my open wound.

I freaked out, reaching for the corrid which was gliding through the water near my knee, and tried to toss it out of the tub.

It was a mistake.

The thing, which had until now moved slowly and lazily, stiffened up at being touched and in a flash, recoiled back and bit me in the arm.

I managed to toss the thing onto the tile floor, but not without ripping a large gash out of my upper arm where its mouth had attached. Bleeding from my arm and my thigh, I scrambled out of the tub and toward the exit.

"Let me out!" I shouted, banging on the door.

"I can't open the door while the corrid is still alive," Dr. Rodney said calmly.

I turned around and froze.

The corrid was changing form. While it appeared in the water to be a long wormlike creature, the corrid actually had limbs. Four black appendages split off from the center of the thing. Two of them functioned something like legs, while the other two wriggled wildly up near its gaping mouth.

It hissed and snapped its jagged teeth at me, but didn't come any closer.

"There's a bat on the table over there. Kill the corrid and this will all be over."

I rushed over to the bat, keeping my eye on the monster before me, expecting it to strike at any moment. But it remained planted in place.

Shaking, I stepped toward the corrid, bat raised over my head.

It snapped, it flailed, but it didn't approach.

Just as it was near enough to take a swing, it pounced, far faster than I could have expected. My swing missed, and it latched onto my calf. Pain shot through my leg as I tried to shake it off with a kick. But it held on.

I struck at it wildly with the bat, hitting myself as often as I hit it. But eventually something worked, and the corrid released. That's when, with as much strength as I could muster, I brought the bat down squarely on the awful thing. It shrieked and feebly tried to writhe away. But my next strike fell. And then another.

Greenish goo splattered from the corrid as I bashed the motionless heap in a terrified frenzy.

Finally, shaking and out of breath, I dropped the bat and burst into sobs.

Dr. Rodney was by my side shortly after.

"I'm sorry I had to surprise you like that. I didn't want you to worry too much beforehand. But you did a great job."

I responded, but I doubt it was decipherable through my hysteria.

"Let's get you patched up," he said.

Fifteen stitches later, I was walking out of Dr. Rodney's office on my way home.

And while I'm happy to be corrid free, my mind still goes back to that lake. Every once in a while, the urge rises in me to go back for [another swim.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MattBenjamin/comments/1p1itsv/clearview_master_post/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
