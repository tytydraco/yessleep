It began on what seemed like a typical Friday evening. My partner, Tom, was having his farewell evening from work, celebrating his transition to a new job. I remember watching him get dressed, smiling and excited about the night ahead with his colleagues. I had no concerns; Tom had always been loyal and truthful. We parted with a kiss, and I wished him fun.  
  
After he left, I decided to spend a quiet night at home. We texted briefly after his arrival, but as the party got underway, our communication ceased. I thought nothing of it and went to bed early.  
  
Around midnight, I woke up and realized Tom hadn't come home yet. It was unusual for him, but I tried not to worry. To distract myself, I reached for his tablet on the bedside table to read a book I had recently downloaded. When I turned on the tablet, his social media account was still open, and I saw a live feed from the party. Curiously, I began scrolling.  
  
At first, it was normal pictures â€“ Tom with his colleagues, laughing, drinking. But then a photo caught my eye. It showed Tom dancing closely with a work colleague, Emma. Their gaze at each other was intense, more than just friendly. My heart started to race. I scrolled further, each new picture and video revealing more of their intimacy. The last video showed them getting into a taxi together, apparently headed to her apartment. I was shocked and felt my trust in him shattering.  
  
I texted Tom, asking where he was, but got no reply. I lay awake all night, unable to sleep, my thoughts racing. What did this mean? Was everything we had a lie?  
  
The next morning, Tom came home. He looked tired but otherwise normal. I immediately confronted him with the images. His expression shifted from surprise to horror as he realized I had seen everything. He tried to play it down, said it was just harmless flirting, that nothing happened. But the images and videos told a different story. We argued, tears flowed, words we couldn't take back were spoken.  
  
The following days were an emotional whirlwind. Tom kept apologizing, insisting it was a one-time mistake, that he loved me and would do anything to make it right. But every time I looked at him, I only saw the images of him and Emma. I couldn't understand how he could do this, how he could so recklessly gamble with our relationship.  
  
I moved in with a friend to get some space. The nights were long, filled with tears and questions. What had I done wrong? Could I ever trust Tom again? Should I give him a second chance? The memories of our time together now seemed tainted by the events of that night.  
  
In the weeks that followed, I talked to friends and family, seeking advice and comfort. Tom continued to write to me, pleading for a chance to explain, to show that he had changed. But I wasn't sure if I could go back, if I could erase those images from my mind.  
  
Now, several weeks later, I'm still faced with this decision. On one hand, I miss the good times with Tom, the moments when we laughed and made plans for the future. On the other hand, I feel hurt and betrayed, unsure if those memories are enough to overcome the pain of that night.  
  
The decision still lies ahead, but I know I need to take time to make the right choice for my future.
