I am writing this minutes after attempting suicide. Despite my hypoxia-addled mind, I believe that the events which have just transpired need to be detailed and shared with the masses. The world needs to know what I have just seen.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I went about it as I usually do. I committed a strangled genuflect– acting as my own personal papist and executioner.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Through the ink-like darkness pooling into and obscuring my vision, I saw it. It looked like a biblically accurate angel if it was made out of kaleidoscopes (and if those kaleidoscopes were made out of stained glass portraits of a lion’s maw). I felt a wave of deja vu wash over me, recalling the hallucinations I experienced after overdosing on cough syrup.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That’s not the scary part though. Crowded around it were overlapping apparitions writhing and sobbing on the ground. It was upon squinting that I realized these ghosts were familiar. My world began to spin as I came to understand that these ghosts were me, all of them in varying states of misery.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And It was devouring them, carnivorous teeth spinning like windmills.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was so startled by this that I remained kneeling in frozen terror– poised like the executioner’s next kill– only capable of watching and witnessing the horror of the events transpiring in front of me. Hot tears dripped down the burst capillaries in my cheeks and soundlessly hit the ground. It felt like my entire life had been leading up to this one horrifying moment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A memory came to the forefront of my mind, of playing video games with my younger brother– one of the only times I can recall feeling no anxiety or despair. It was due to this recollection that I could no longer hold back the choking sobs inside my throat, and it was because of my tearful coughs that It, the specter, finally noticed me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It opened Its many mouths, and with a voice that smelled like petrichor and weather vanes it warbled, “You Should Stay.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ears burning, I wordlessly nodded my head.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You Should Stay.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I don’t know what you mean,” I said dumbly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do You Promise To Stay?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I stared at my gored corpses scattered across the floor like shattered Christmas ornaments.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That’s The Vestiges Of Your Misery.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In my mind’s eye, I remembered myself coming home from school on a rainy day, tracking mud into my house because I forgot to wipe my boots off on the mat.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I Am Sustained By The Misery Of Your Species.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Strangely I began to recall a Wikipedia article I had read about suckermouth catfish. Highly demanded as bottom cleaners in the Aquarium Trade.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I Want You To Know That I Am Grateful For The Feasts You Have Granted Me In Your Life. Out Of Everyone I Have Attached Myself To, You Have Managed To Live The Longest, Even In The Wake Of Such Bountiful Despair.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I think my terror hit a plateau at some point during this, and somehow this gave me enough confidence to cough out, “...what? Are you killing me?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

From Its’ kaleidoscope maws, there erupted a sound like a thousand hummingbirds' wing beats. I assume this was as close a proximation as It could come to a laugh.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Would You Destroy Your Favorite Restaurant? It Is In My Best Interest To Eat, So It Is In My Best Interest To Keep You Alive. I Attached Myself To You Not Parasitically But Mutualistically. Creatures Like Myself, Misery Feeders, Have Subsumed Your Race Much Like How Plant Cells Absorbed And Became One With Photosynthetic Prokaryotes. You Have Evolved To Have A Capacity For Misery Beyond That Of Any Other Species On This Earth, And My Species Has Evolved To Subsist Off Of That Misery Solely."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Like coral and algae."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Exactly. How, I Ask You, Would Such Miserable Creatures As Yourselves Be Able To Persevere If There Were Not Some Outside Force Keeping You Alive?  How You Long For Self-destruction, How You Yearn To Vanish Yourselves.  Even Now, My People Are The Sole Force Standing Between Billions Of Lives Lost To Suicide. Every Week We Narrowly Stop A Government Official From Annihilating A Neighboring Country.

Every Month We Meet Here In This Room–

And I Stand Between You And Death Every Time.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After hearing this I began to feel like my blood had been carbonated. I passed out, but before completely losing consciousness, I thought I could feel a hand stroking my cheek. That brings me to the end of my recollection. I think it is critical that we acknowledge these deities, and that we attempt to understand them before we are forced to.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Though, I think really all I want is for other people to know what I know now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even now I can feel It feeding. I’m sure if you try, you can too.
