I sat there facing the hypnotizing yellow light coming from the lamp. The mild sound of pots and pans coming from the kitchen, while my wife samantha cooked. We had been married for 10 years, however she never stopped looking the way she looked to me when I first met her.

Our house was pretty modest. It was in a suburban area with a pretty food neighbourhood and sort of like the ones you see in classic american movies. I had a good job as a banker and made ends meet pretty well. Samantha also worked as a cop but left after we had our daughter 'Cathy.'

Speaking of her, as i was sitting in my chair near the fireplace, I heard a shriek and saw Cathy run towards me crying and shrieking. "Hey what happened?", I said to her.
She came running and sunk straight into my arms crying.
After she calmed doen a little I asked her again,"If you won't tell me what happened I can't help you." She sniffed back her snot and said in broken words,"Mr muffins broke." Mr. Muffins was her favourite teddy bear, wheni checked him he seemed to have his sewing removed.

"Ohh, it's nothing that can't be fixed, mom will fix it after making dinner. Isn't that right honey? I said to Cathy, later talking to Samantha. "Sure honey." She spoke out of the kitchen.

It was a happy moment, I mean not I liked my daughter crying, but i always wanted to live in a house where everybody loved one another after my broken childhood.

And then it all came crashing down.

A loud sound of glass breaking came from the window near the front door. I quickly covered Cathy's mouth and ran to Samantha leading them both into the master bedroom. "Wait here." I said to them. Samantha objected but I knew i had to check this situation out.

I grabbed a knife out of the kitchen and hid behind a wall, crouched, watching over the thief who was dressed in all black.I didn't charge, I was scared over the fact there could be multiple people here and they might possess a firearm. 

Adrenaline was rushing through me, every nerve in my body was heperactive, my senses were in hyper alert mode and in that moment of sheer rush, I felt it. A sudden  tap on my shoulder, I swung back with my knife holding hand, followed by a shriek.

There lay the corpse of my daughter with a knife in her neck and it all came running back to me.

I had killed my daughter again.
--------------------------------------------Ã—------------------------------------------------

I had done this before, All of it. This moment was two years before my death, the utter shock made me not realize my daughter laying before me. It all went the same after that, Samantha and I couldn't hold it together, she blamed me and I blamed myself. Why was I experiencing the worst moments of my life again.

I pushed myself away from the world and two years later as per the script, jumped of the 13th floor ending my miser-

I sat there facing the hypnotizing yellow light coming from the lamp. The mild sound of pots and pans coming from the kitchen, while my wife samantha cooked. We had been married for 10 years, however she never stopped looking the way she looked to me when I first met he-

Wait no, I remember it now. A chance, from the heavens, This my chance to straighten my life, a fucking time loop. I can do this.

Cathy came crying towards and I quickly grabbed her and samantha and locked them in bedroom, and by the dot the sound of a window came crashing in, I now knew that where he was going to be, so I took the strategic position behind the kitchen door and waited for the burglar to arrive, I waited and waited but he never came and then a sharp pain in my head as my world went dark

I woke up feeling nearly dead, I tried to touch my head but realised that both my hands and feet were tied together.
As my vision slowly came together what I saw was my worst nightmare and more in reality. There sat my wife and my daughter killed in a way which I'd rather not describe.

I screamed at the horror in front of me as the sounds of sirens loomed in the background. The cops had arrived but they could piece together nothing from the broken man I was at that moment, why not kill me. Why.

Two years later I killed myself the same way.

And there i was facing that yellow light again.

I tried many times, I have honestly lost count, but no matter what I try, it never seems to work. The burglars always come feom different areas and manage to surpise me.

I have stopped trying, even leavimg the house didn't work, and my wife and daughter were shot in the car.

I don't know what to do.

The same yellow light blindinig my face as I felt my carpet for who knows, which hundreth time.
I was tired, I decided to fight this time, I would not have this torture again and as the familiar sound of glass started ringing my ears, I felt Cathy's arms cling to my legs, as the man dressed in black walked towards me.

I charged towards him and was pushed back with equal force as he grabbed my daughter. "WHY WONT YOU KILL ME!!" i screamed at him. He remained silent.

Tears flood my eyes as I saw him grab my daughter. "THIS IS...", my words trailed of as I smiled. A wave of realization hit me accompanied by laughter. "So thereis no forgiveness to even accidents huh." I smirked.

That night I laughed as the burglar killed the girl in front of me.
