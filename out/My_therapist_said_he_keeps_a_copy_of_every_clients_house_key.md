I’m writing this because I need to get it out. I don’t know what this is, exactly — a warning? A record? Proof I still exist?

Maybe just a way to convince myself I’m not losing my mind. Because that’s how it works, right? That’s how they get in. Not with violence. Not with knives. With questions. With the slow unravelling of things you *thought* were solid.

I started therapy a while back after a rough breakup. Classic stuff — panic attacks, shame spirals, waking up at 3 a.m. convinced no one would ever love me again. Dr. N was recommended by a friend. Said he was calm, “unusually perceptive.” That turned out to be true — *too* true.

He looked the part: mid-40s, soft voice, kind eyes, beard like a high school philosophy teacher. The office was beige and quiet, just a ticking clock and that faint smell of something herbal — not flowers, something older. Something you’d find in a drawer that hadn’t been opened in decades.

At first, he was exactly what I needed. He never interrupted. Never pushed. Just asked the right questions at the right time. A few sessions in, I was telling him things I hadn’t told anyone. Things I hadn’t even formed into *words* before.

That’s what makes this so hard. He didn’t feel dangerous. He felt *safe*.

Until one day, he didn’t.

It was session fourteen. I remember because I’d just started to feel like I was making progress. We were talking about my fear of home invasion — not just the fear, but the rituals. Triple-checking locks. Leaving the hallway light on. Sleeping with a flashlight under my pillow.

He smiled and said, “You know, I keep a copy of every client’s house key.”

He said it lightly. Like a joke.

I stared at him.

He smiled again. “Just kidding.”

But there was a pause after that — the kind of silence that doesn’t land right. Like he was watching to see how much I believed him.

I laughed awkwardly. Said something like, “Guess I better start locking the windows, too.”  
He didn’t reply. Just wrote something down for the first time ever in our sessions.

I should’ve walked away then.

Over the next few weeks, little things started happening at home.

At first, I thought I was just being forgetful. I’d come home and my shampoo bottle would be in the wrong place — not fallen, just rotated. The lid unscrewed a little. Once, my toothbrush was damp at 3 p.m. I hadn’t been home since morning.

Another time, the fridge door was open just a crack. Nothing missing. Nothing spoiled. Just... open.

It never escalated. Nothing loud. Nothing obvious. Just *wrongness* in the small details.

I started testing it. Taped a single hair across the crack of my bedroom door. Sprinkled talcum powder by the entryway. Left a glass of water on the counter and measured the meniscus. I didn’t tell anyone — not even Dr. N. I wanted to be sure.

The hair would be gone.  
The powder scuffed.  
The water level — lower, by millimetres.

So I changed the locks. Bought a triple deadbolt system, self-installed. Didn’t tell my landlord. Didn’t write it down. Didn’t even mention it aloud in my apartment.

Next session, he smiled and said, “Feeling safer at home now?”

That was the last time I saw him.

I stopped showing up. Ignored his calls. Blocked the clinic number. I thought I was done.

But a week later, he emailed me.

>

There it was again — that phrase. *Safe at home.*

I moved the next month. New suburb. New number. Didn’t tell friends the address. Scrubbed myself off every online listing I could find. Bought blackout curtains and a door jammer. I even covered the peephole with tape.

It worked. For a while.

Then yesterday, I checked my letterbox.

Inside was a plain white envelope. No name, no stamp, no return address. Just my unit number in block letters. My *new* unit number. One I never gave out.

Inside the envelope was a single key — my key.  
Taped to a sheet of blank paper.  
And written underneath, in tiny, careful handwriting:

***You forgot to give me your spare.***

I haven’t gone to the police. What would I even say?

*“My ex-therapist mailed me my own key and I’m scared he exists?”*

They’d ask how he got the address. I wouldn’t have an answer.  
They’d ask for proof. I don’t have any.  
They’d ask if I was still taking my medication.

And maybe that’s the point.

Because I think this was never about therapy.  
It was about access.  
Conditioning.  
Compliance.

I thought the sessions were for healing, but now I think they were rehearsals.  
Every question was a prompt.  
Every silence was a test.  
Every “joke” was a blueprint.

And when I stopped showing up, it didn’t stop him.  
It *activated* him.

Since the envelope arrived, small things have started again.

The blinds shift positions.  
A spoon I never use ends up in the sink.  
My razor is slightly damp in the morning.  
Once, I woke up and the light in the *closet* was on. I haven’t opened that door in weeks.

Last night, I was going through my drawer and found something that wasn’t mine.  
A folded piece of paper between receipts and expired coupons.

It was a printout of my original intake form from last year.  
Date-stamped. Signed. My handwriting.  
But under the notes section, in red pen, was something new:

**Client Case File #0042 — Complete Acquisition.**  
**Progress: 92%.**  
**DO NOT INTERRUPT CYCLE.**

And then, scribbled beneath it in shaky black ink — my own handwriting, but… wrong, like I’d written it in a dream:

***I consent.***

That’s not how this ends.  
It’s how it was *meant* to end.

I thought I escaped him.  
But now I think the only reason I still exist… is because he’s *not finished yet.*

And tonight, as I write this, I just heard something in the hallway.

Not a creak.  
Not a thump.  
A *click.*  
Deliberate.  
Mechanical.  
A key.

Turning in the deadlock.
