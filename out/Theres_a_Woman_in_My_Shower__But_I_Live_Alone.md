It started innocently enough. I came home from work late last night, exhausted, to find the bathroom light on. I hadn’t left it on—I’m meticulous about turning off lights to save on the electric bill. But I brushed it off, thinking maybe I’d just forgotten in my rush to leave that morning.  

I didn’t notice it at first. I didn’t notice *her.*  

The sound of the shower running woke me at 2 a.m. At first, I thought it was the pipes. My apartment is old, and strange noises are part of the charm (or so the landlord says). But when I got up to check, I saw steam pooling out from under the bathroom door.  

I froze. I live alone.  

The door handle was warm to the touch. I hesitated, every nerve in my body screaming for me to run. But curiosity—or maybe stupidity—got the better of me. I pushed the door open.  

The mirror was fogged over, and water streamed down the shower curtain. For a second, I was ready to laugh it off. Maybe I’d turned the shower on accidentally earlier in the night. Maybe—  

Then I saw the shadow. A figure behind the curtain, silhouetted by the bathroom’s faint yellow light.  

“Who’s there?” My voice cracked, sounding far less intimidating than I’d hoped.  

The shadow didn’t move. It just stood there. Watching me. Or waiting.  

I grabbed the heaviest thing I could find—a bottle of shampoo—and yanked the curtain open.  

The shower was empty. The water was still running, pouring down on the spotless porcelain. But there was no one inside.  

Heart pounding, I turned off the water, shaking so hard I could barely grip the handle. When I looked up, the mirror was still foggy, except for one spot. Four words were scrawled there, written in the steam:  

“Why did you look?”

I stumbled back, nearly tripping over the bath mat. I hadn’t noticed before, but the air in the bathroom felt wrong—heavy, oppressive, like the moment before a thunderstorm. My instincts screamed at me to leave.  

I bolted out of the bathroom and locked the door behind me, though I wasn’t sure what good it would do. My hands were trembling so much that I dropped my phone twice before I could dial the police.  

The dispatcher sounded calm, almost bored, as I explained that someone had broken into my apartment. “Stay on the line,” she said, but her voice faded into static.  

Then I heard it.  

The shower turned on again.  

This time, the sound was different. It wasn’t just water—it was humming. A soft, melodic tune, eerily cheerful, coming from behind the locked bathroom door.  

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen. My mind raced as I backed toward the front door, my eyes glued to the bathroom. But as I reached for the knob, a thought stopped me cold: what if *it* was already outside?  

The humming stopped.  

And then, from the other side of the door, came a knock. Soft at first, then louder.  

“Come back,” a voice whispered. It sounded distorted, like it wasn’t quite human.  

I did what any sane person would do. I ran. I didn’t stop running until I reached my car. I didn’t even lock the apartment door behind me.  

When the police arrived, they found no signs of forced entry. My bathroom was dry, the mirror spotless. They chalked it up to stress and a vivid imagination.  

But I know what I saw. I know what I heard.  

I’ve been staying at a motel since then, trying to convince myself it’s over. But last night, I woke up to the sound of water dripping. There was steam on the motel mirror.  

And written in the condensation were the same four words:  

“Why did you look?”

This time, there was something else beneath it:  

“You can’t hide.”
