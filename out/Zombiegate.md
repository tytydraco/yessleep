Sold my soul - You walked away - Haven't seen you since that day...

-Dion from The Bronx

My real Dad, not my parallel universe Dad, had been a Dion & The Belmonts fanatic. That's when we watched screens. Now they watch us back. But old New York City is almost past the bleachers in The Bronx, not that Yankee Stadium is where it was. Everything changes. Including Brooklyn. Where I was having another argument about:

Zombiegate

Yesterday at 3pm:

Vera: It's coming through.

Me: They be the correct pronoun, Vera.

Vera: Really, You wanna start up with that shit?

Me: (stifling a giggle...): Get the flameblower.

Vera pulled out a blood spattered handkerchief from the left cheek pocket of her 1978 vintage Jordache jeans.

She looged up a bloody lulu and hacked enough epithelial lung wad into the handkerchief. She pulled a fifth of rye from the other pocket and took a belt.

Vera: That's the first sensible thing you said since... she trailed off. Not 30 seconds Vera came out, red  firewoman hat, the whole regalia with all the paraphernalia the destroyer of the undead demands; tight jeans and all.

CANNIBAL HANNIBAL CANNIBAL

I looked at the Zombie. His face was all jacked up. He looked like my narcissistic Grandma who loved to beat me at chess when I was five. Man, you take your hand off the piece, that's it. No go-backsies with Grandma, she had this fucking jade choker, too. But that's another story.

Vera said: Stand back Jack. It's about to get hot!

I did and it did and they did. In fact, that Zombie started to get the shimmy shake, and I could see our reality and the parallel universe where my brave Knight like got your back Dad, I never met always showed up.

But nope, And then, right behind my Zombie Grammy, was my real world Dion doowopping douchebag of a deadbeat Dad. Man, where'd they dig him up. I tell you, never fall for a Zombie hunter. Zombies can't be seen by everyone. They're that chill. They're that real-time chowder head trying to make your life miserable. You know the one. Dial 1-800-ASSHOLE

It's fucking really like Dr. Strange except when you die you done. So, all things being equal...

**FIRE IN THE HOLE**

The heat is on. Grandma and Poppa Zombie woof got their Zombie asses flamed up.

8 months ago. Shitty landlord complaining about fixing my one ton security gate by the window by the fire escape.

Timmy: Why you need this thing?

I had insisted on it when I moved in twenty-five years ago. I looked at the small one bedroom. Not much to see. A stuffed kangaroo and her pal Joey. A sad ass dried up Charlie Brown Antichristmas tree. Beat up leather couch from the twentieth century. Bedroom looked out on a busy corner across from a garden. I liked trees. Unlike Zombie relatives making unwanted visits.

Me: Timmy. Why do you have to know? I want it. That's it. Fix it.

There must have been something in my voice. Walking through Prospect Park in the real world 1970s and reminiscing,

1975: Big ass kid appears out of nowhere.

GIMME YOUR WATCH.

Me: Bye bye, Mickey mouse watch.

That's why I wanted a fucking gate. But who knew.... Who knew?

They worked on Zombies. So, if you're having a Zombie problem; you know the one. Those soul fucking sucking creatures only you can see. The ones who wait until you're Pappy is sixty-five and can't see so good no more. So, they give him a Mickey Mouse watch. They don't punch him in the beak like I got punched though. They let the forty years of his life they sucked from his Harrow marrow.

Never give in. Never, never, never, never, never, never...

-Churchill to the Harrow Class

And that's where Vera came in. Tight jeans, zippo and gasoline; if you know what I mean - she's my rock & roll queen.

Vera: (Which one?)

This was an inside joke by now due to the Zombie infestation that had been plaguing me since childhood. It's like that Rowdy Roddy flick They Live. Pronouns just worked out on that one. One love. But Zombies disturb the cosmic piece.

Es no vale la pena.

Brooklyn v. Zombies

Vera: Hey, fuckface. I asked which one.

The Zombie dad of mine lost a finger trying to reach behind the slats.

So Vera was obsessed with the 1970s. That's why the Jordache jeans and you don't know the half of it. But she fucking was a very violent person. She controlled it which I liked. But you could tell, she had some deep down grouchies.

And when a Zombie, who I thought only sad lonely me could see she jumped in front of one and pulled fucking what looked like Bear spray or mace for giants out of her trench coat and the fucking Zombie turned fetid tail dripping brown and ran.

Me: Holy shit. You see them too?

Vera: Never saw one before but they were like a hotdog left in the sun a week in Texas July.

Vera: Earth to fuckface. Which song?

Me: Disco Inferno.

Vera smiled. Fire in the Zombie hole.

I watched my Zombie relatives grow hot, make a fuss and finally combust. Smoke gets in your eyes.

Vera: You were looking at them funny, fuckface? What's up?

Me: Looked like my real world family of origin.

Vera: Shit. Did you want to cook them yourself?

Me: Nah.

I took the Zippo from Vera's hand and lit one up and took a drag. I held it a long moment and then let out a plume reminiscent of a tombstone.

Me, continuing: Nah. Nobody does it better.

Vera: Looking me up & down like a pork chop. Get in the bedroom fuckface.

And that's why, if you live with a window with a fire escape get a security gate. A heavy metal one with slats to shoot the flames in. Believe it or not the flames burn in the real world, the parallels and the Zombies feel that shit. Support your local Sheriff of Zombietown.
