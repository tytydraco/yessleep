I was always a sickly boy. I never really excelled in sports or any kind of physical activity in school, but I always assumed I wasn’t built for it. Some kids had speed or strength. I had… nosebleeds and dizziness.

My father wasn’t too happy about that, not because he didn’t love me, but because he didn’t understand. He grew up in a family where you worked hard, you toughed things out, you didn’t complain. When I wheezed halfway through a mile run or came home with bruises I didn’t remember getting, he’d just stare at me with that tight look around his eyes. Not angry—just confused.

I think it scared him that his son was proof that weakness wasn’t always a choice.

My mother tried to bridge the gap between us. She’d sit beside me on the couch with an ice pack while Dad paced in the kitchen. She’d press her hand to my forehead, brush my hair back, and whisper, “He’s just worried,” like that was enough to make the room stop spinning.

They took me to the doctor constantly. I remember the smell of antiseptic better than the smell of our living room. Blood work, scans, allergy tests—everything. I lost track of how many times a nurse wrapped a rubber tourniquet around my arm. They never found a single thing wrong with me.
“Perfectly healthy,” they’d say, while I sat there with purple bruises blooming on my ribs like ink stains.

Sometimes Dad would drive us home in silence, gripping the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles went white. Other times he’d mutter, “There has to be something,” as if willing a diagnosis to appear.

As I got older, it got worse. The migraines came first—sharp, pulsing flashes behind my eyes that made me feel like someone was tightening a clamp around my skull. I’d curl up in the dark of my bedroom while Mom rubbed slow circles on my back, whispering that it was just stress, or hormones, or growing pains.

Then the nosebleeds. They’d start suddenly, dripping onto my shirt or my homework before I even felt the warm trickle. More than once my teachers sent me to the nurse because they thought someone had hit me.

Breathing got harder too. Sometimes it felt like the air was too thick or too hot in my lungs. Bright lights made my head pound, so I spent most of my time in dark places—quiet libraries, the back corner of cafés, empty classrooms after everyone had gone home. Darkness felt kinder. Softer.

One evening, when I was sixteen, I collapsed in the hallway after standing up too fast. Dad caught me before I hit the ground. I remember his hands shaking as he lowered me onto the couch. He kept saying my name, over and over, like he thought I’d slip away if he stopped.

For a while after that, things settled into a routine. A painful one, but familiar. I almost forgot what it felt like to be normal.

Then a few weeks ago, something changed.

It didn’t feel like sickness anymore. It felt like… heat. Like someone had lit a thin fuse just under my skin.

It started in my arms—just a faint warmth at first—but last night it flared so suddenly I thought I’d burned myself on the stove. I looked down and watched a bruise form on my forearm. Not fade in. Form.

A dark burst under the skin, spreading like spilled ink.

I hadn’t hit anything.

The nosebleeds got worse too. Not constant—just violent. Short, sharp bursts that left metallic-tasting clots in the back of my throat. I had one in the shower yesterday and watched the water turn red around my feet in swirling ribbons.

But tonight… tonight was different.

I woke up choking on the taste of iron. I sat up, wiping at my nose, expecting the usual mess. But when I flipped on the light, the blood on my hands wasn’t the normal dark red.

It was almost black.

Thick. Sticky. Like oil.

And the moment the light hit it, my skin started to burn—really burn—like the blood itself was heating up against me. I dropped the tissue and backed into the corner of my room, turning off the light as fast as I could.

I’m sitting here now in the dark because it hurts less when the lights are off. My arm is throbbing where the bruise spread earlier, and I swear I can feel the heat moving—slowly—climbing up toward my shoulder.

I don’t know what’s happening to me, but something is wrong.
Something is happening inside me.

And I think… I think it’s getting worse.

I knew no medical expert would know what was happening, so I turned to weirder sources. Not magic websites or anything like that—just old forums, genealogy threads, odd corners of the internet where people talk about “unexplained physical conditions.” I reached out to a few so-called experts, and even some older family members who knew more about our history than my parents ever did.

I wasn’t expecting anything real.

But I found something.

Apparently, there were a few cases on my mother’s side—very old ones—where people had symptoms like mine. Most of the family notes called it a weakness or “bad blood.” A few old entries mentioned possession or curses, but I figured those were just old-time explanations for illnesses they didn’t understand.

Then I came across one ancestor in particular. He’d kept a journal, and someone in the family had scanned a few pages years ago. The handwriting was barely legible, but one part stuck out:

He described his blood turning dark. Burning under his skin. Bruising that spread without cause.

He wrote that someone had “marked” him after an argument in a tavern—no details, no proof, just fear written in messy ink. He called it a blood curse, but he never explained how he knew. It could have been superstition, or guilt, or just a drunk man’s paranoia.

I don’t know what to believe.

The journal said the blood reacted badly to heat and light. That’s the part that keeps replaying in my head, because that’s… that’s what’s happening to me.

But it doesn’t explain anything else. It doesn’t say how it started, or if he survived, or if he found a way to stop it. It just ends. Abruptly.

What am I supposed to do with that? Apologize on behalf of a man who’s been dead for centuries? Track down a stranger he wronged? Perform some ritual from a journal that didn’t even bother to list one?

I honestly don’t know.

So I’m hiding in my room.

I keep it as cold as I can, and I only go out at night. It lets me hold myself together just long enough to feel like a person for a little while—long enough to remember what normal used to feel like.

But even now, even in the dark, even in the cold… I feel like I’m burning from the inside out.

And I don’t think I have much time left.
