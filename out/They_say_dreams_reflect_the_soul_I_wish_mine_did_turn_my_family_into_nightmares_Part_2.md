Part 1
—

I’d been staring at that flower on my nightstand for some time now. After every blink, a new worry that it would move was heavy in my tired eyes. But it did not, only its silent indication spoke to me.

My hand found my forehead as I rubbed at it, desperate to wipe away the stone under my skin. It soon moved to my stomach as it growled and pinched at me, telling me it needed food. Yet as I got up, I found myself seeing my two girls, the way they sounded the way they smelled. How happy they had been when all I did was walk through a door.

Hunger wasn’t the only pain in my belly. It wasn’t the pain I cared about.

I shut my eyes, spending the next hour for a return to that world I wanted so desperately to be real. A dream in a dream.

When I finally drifted off, it was different. There was no cloud to reveal it’s insides. Only a bleak house, with no one inside.

Still, I was fully aware I was in a dream. It was our home, but a side of it I had not seen until then. Where would usually be curtains full of sunlight drizzling into the kitchen I stood in, was now dark as the second before drifting off to sleep. “Olivia?” I called out to it, “Billie?”

Nothing came in reply, just the shadow creeping across my senses, laughing at me, taunting me where I stood. The ringing in my ears persisted in its attempt to fill the void until it was broken. Through the entryway in front of me, into the living room, something had moved. A slow, steady squeaking, following behind it as small sounding as a rat in a wall.

A single chair had moved across the floor, pulled by an invisible force somewhere in that room. It was being nudged slowly, inches at a time turning to feet until it reached the middle of the entryway.

As soon as I could realize the large wheel under the back rest, the lights flipped on. Something launching at my face where the chair once was. Something contorted, ugly, and small. I knew it had been Billy by the flowers covering her body. Patches had been scattered throughout, gone to the plague that had befallen her for a glimpse to the little girl beneath.

All my addled mind could do was force myself to the left, narrowly avoiding her attack. I landed on the floor, desperately trying to get back to my feet before the scuffle of little limbs could reach me again. When I did, I could see she had stopped, crouched on legs that seemed too many. The flowers on her body beginning to wilt and fall off one by one, then all at once.

A deep rumble sounded from where she loomed, radiating from somewhere in her chest. Her face now visible, I could see how much it had changed. Gone was a little girl I grew to love so fast. Now was a monster, its face drooping as if made of wet clay. As pale as what lay around her feet.

For a second, the idea of running to embrace her crossed my mind. The nightmare in front of me still the shape of Billie as she started towards me.

I ran in the opposite direction, unsure as to where I was going. The hurried, heavy foot falls coming behind me drove me up the stairs. All the while my head convincing its thoughts to change, morph this dream into what it once was, how it used to make me feel. Not this fear being strung along the many veins under my skin.

I cursed as I slammed the door to my bedroom, the bang that vibrated the entire wall making me realize how close she was.

As I stood, pressing myself against the entrance, a crack split from somewhere on the other side. It was a deep, sharp sound, like a homerun with a baseball bat made from a femur.

My breath had caught at this, making me recoil back the second time it happened. The third break drew me back a few feet away, as a sharp hiss that sounded like it came from multiple little spots from the thing behind the door. Motion brought my eyes down to the short crack below the door where hundreds, thousands of string like dark veins wiggled towards me.

The shock had tripped me, my back hitting the floor as those reaching things moved closer and closer. Before I knew it, they were at my legs, puncturing my skin, one by one like pins and needles hooked throughout my muscle. Any attempt to flee, to pull away was met with a tight drag closer to the door and a guttural scream from my throat.

I yelled, trying my best to wake myself from this rouge nightmare. It felt like my skin was being pulled off the bone as more of those thin veins punctured my leg.

Trying to reach forward and wrench them away only caused some of them to latch onto my hands, my fingers, my wrists. Drawing blood up my arms and across the hardwood floor.

My tear-stained eyes managed to look up, the door completely gone, the invading blood vessels no longer there.

“Asher?”

Olivia had been there, a terrible look on her face. She had been only in her nightgown, a light silhouetted between her legs from a lamp behind her. 

“I miss you Asher, help me-“

She was cut off by the form jutting out from the right. My eye’s bulged at the sight of it, launching itself at her, disappearing somewhere on the other side.

The sounds of ripping, shredding so loud it drove me back further into the room. Olivia’s scream followed each sound of her flesh being torn apart. Stumbling, my legs hardly working as they unconsciously moved towards the single window in the room. Knocking over some piece of furniture with a loud crash that my frightened mind refused to acknowledge, I ripped the thin curtain to the floor.

Leaning my elbows on the windowsill, the only thing keeping me upright, I prepared to jump out. My body stopping as I really looked at what was before me. The trees were gone; there was nowhere to grow from. Only another room, unfathomably large, the kind of light that only the absence of a sun could bring.

Then, the only thing that could be more horrifying than ears filled with screams of agony, was silence. The muscle under my skin continued to shiver with an intensity I have never felt in my life. Before I could comprehend what my house had sat in, the silence drove my attention behind me.

A long, excruciating moment passed where nothing happened, broken by what hit the floor in front of me. My wife’s body had been covered in crimson blood; the places missing flesh had been gushing more into the quickly formed pool around her. Her eye open, staring right into my own.

Her head split open vertically with the same gut-wrenching crunch from before, the hollow insides now into view. More of those wiggling veins erupted from where her brain should be. They scattered from her, shooting hundreds of thin tethers at me as they latched into my skin.

The invasion of my body sent a terrible yell through the room; it mingled with the hissing of the things still spilling from her head. I spun onto my stomach, trying with everything not to be pulled in. Which happened to be nothing more than scratches into the floor with what remained of my fingernails. The more force in which I pulled, the more the muscles in my legs began to rip, separating one strand at a time until the hissing from the monster crescendoed its peak.

I was being consumed into the hole where my wife’s thoughts used to lay. God only knows what form I took in them. What would she think of me now, would she think the same as I think of myself?

Unable to fight anymore, I had been pulled in just above my waist, my legs now gone to the cavern below me, each inch I moved was accompanied by more of those veins. All the pain left me as Olivia’s head clamped down, snapping what was probably my spine.

The next thing I knew, I was gasping for air.

I was covered in sweat, laying in my bed. The visceral pain in my legs making me rip the blanket from them. What I thought would be a sea of blood turned out to be the land of pale, dry skin. Not a drop of crimson staining my sheets.

I'm not sure how long I had stared at them, the stinging sensation slowly wearing off until they inevitably did not feel real anymore.

My chest still heaving, I took one swipe with my arm. The resulting crash singing its broken song throughout the room. I cursed, a vicious string of anger leaving me as I looked at the broken picture frame on the floor.

I stared at the grinning, happy mouth as pieces of glass shrouded the top of her face, the rest of my body bubbling up the hopeless feelings I've harbored for so long. Few people know what it feels like to need something so dear to you, only to be blocked by a barrier indescribably impenetrable that no matter how you twisted the circumstances it would never fall. No compromises, nothing but the dust on the picture frames to lure you into a web that doesn’t fix the pain.

I just feel so lost, so angry.

And I can't stand it.

I haven’t been sleeping very well since then. I'm not sure how many times I've seen the same numbers on the clock on my desk, but I get scared whenever they get close to midnight. I don’t eat much either, more than I did when I was living in my dreams, however. Food doesn’t really have any taste to it, like I'm eating wet lawn trimmings.

When I stepped outside, it hit me just how long it had been since I've stepped into the sun. The sky, endless with no horizon the higher you look seems almost scary in my bleary eyes.

Every time I go to the grocery store I pretend like I'm okay for the strangers I'll probably never cross again. A woman with glasses and curly black hair almost bumped into me on my last visit. I apologized, walking away not knowing if she was real or all in my head. Now I can’t bring myself to go back to that store on the off chance I see another stranger to give me hope I know is not there.

Being awake, aware of the sights before me wasn’t what I had been really missing. It's what was not there, the empty spaces. The empty everything.

I’m so tired. My baggy eyes feel heavy whenever I don't blink and the dry air doesn’t have its chance to penetrate them.

And sometimes, I find myself sitting in my car, an empty plot of land as my scenery. Trees surround the spot where a house should be, where a turn of a page would’ve taken you through the eyes of a storybook fairytale.

The only thing alive was the rain sprinkling the earth around me as I opened the tiny wooden box in my hand. Inside was its metal contents, divots wrapping around the cylinder and the fingers reaching to touch them. I cranked the side just enough to play a few notes, then shut the box to read the inscription on the lid.

I closed my eyes, leaning my head on the seat behind me. Her smell had all but gone from the car now, nothing but a neutral, familiar scent I've remembered as my own. Some of her stuff was even still in there, collecting dust like everything else. I opened my eyes to see something floating through the rain, landing just on my windshield. It took a second for my eyes to focus on it.

It had been nothing but a single white feather.

My seat groaned as I moved closer to it, then up to the sky. Nothing but clouds covering the sun. I leaned back, cranking the engine to life and letting the a/c hit my face.

But just as I put it in drive, I looked up, my foot frozen on the break. No longer was the area empty and deserted, what now sat surrounded by trees with a house. Its roof curved like a witch's hat; the roof of the house we never got a chance to build.

I left my car, my eyes never leaving the building in front of me until it was cut off at my car's door. Even before my foot, now sticking out to the gravel outside had driven me out, I could see that the house was gone.

All I could do is rub my tired eyes, hoping beyond rationality that it would come back when I looked once more.

But there was nothing but a dream.
