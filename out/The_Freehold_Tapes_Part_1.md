My name is Sam, and I’m an audio archivist for the New England Historical Society. It’s not a glamorous job. Most of my day is spent in a sound-proofed, climate-controlled room in the basement of our building, surrounded by machines that most people haven't seen outside of a museum. I take old, decaying media such as swax cylinders, 1/4-inch magnetic tapes, obscure vinyl formats and I digitize them. I clean them up, restore what I can, and make sure their contents aren't lost to time. Mostly, it’s oral histories with fishermen, recordings of local political speeches from the 50s, stuff like that. It’s quiet, meticulous work. I like it.

Sometimes I think how I might be the last person to listen to such voices. I hope not. Makes me wonder when my voice will be last heard.

About three weeks ago, my supervisor, Dr. Albright, wheeled in a cart with four cardboard boxes on it. They were dusty, stained with what looked like mildew, and smelled of damp earth and decay.

“New acquisition,” she said, handing me a clipboard. “Handle with care. These are… delicate.”

The manifest was brief.

I’d heard of Freehold, but only in whispers. It was one of those strange little blips in New England history. A small, intentional community founded in the deep woods of Maine in the late 1940s by a charismatic preacher named Silas Wentworth. They were isolationists, wanting to live a “purer” life away from the corrupting influence of the modern world. For about thirty years, they did just that. Then, in the winter of 1978, they just… stopped.

A state trooper went out to check on them after months of no contact and found the entire settlement abandoned. Houses were empty but for rotting food on tables. The generator was out of fuel. No signs of violence, no bodies, no notes. Just… gone. The official story was that the community had disbanded, likely moving on to join other communes out west. But the local stories were darker.

And now, the only voices left from that community were sitting in four cardboard boxes in my studio. My job was to listen.

The first week was tedious. The tapes were in terrible shape. I had to bake them, which is a process where you literally heat the tape at a low temperature for several hours to temporarily fix the binder so it doesn't shred itself on playback. Even then, the quality was awful. Hiss, static, dropouts. But I started to get fragments.

Most of the early tapes were what I expected: recordings of Reverend Wentworth’s sermons. He had a deep, resonant voice, but his words were unsettling. He spoke constantly of “The Covenant” and “The Treeline.” He wasn’t a Christian preacher in any traditional sense. He seemed to worship the woods themselves, or something within them.

The first tape that made me pause was labeled “Community Meeting - 10/12/1965.” It was a recording of Wentworth addressing the townsfolk. The audio was clearer than most. I’ve transcribed the relevant section below.

Reverend Silas Wentworth: …and so we must be vigilant. Brother Thomas has asked why his chickens have been taken. He asks if it is a fox, or a bear. It is neither. It is a tax. It is a reminder. The Covenant requires a tithe, not of coin, but of vitality. Of the warmth of a living thing. The Treeline is not a wall; it is a membrane. It is the skin of our protector. And our protector grows hungry.

(A nervous murmur from the crowd.)

Wentworth: Do not be afraid. Fear is a wasted meal. We are safe here, safer than any soul in the cities of men. We need only abide by the terms. We give what is asked. We do not look into the deep woods after sundown. We do not answer a voice that calls our name from the trees if we do not recognize it as our own kin. We do not take from the forest what it does not offer. These are not suggestions. These are the pillars of our survival. Brother Thomas, your chickens have kept us safe for another month. You should be proud.

(Silence. A woman begins to weep softly in the background.)

Wentworth: Sister Agnes, your tears are an insult. They are a salt that stings the soil. We rejoice in our arrangement. We are the keepers of the quiet place. Now, let us pray. Let us thank the soil for its patience and the trees for their silence.

I sat back in my chair, the headphones feeling cold against my ears. A tax. A tithe of vitality. It was folk religion, obviously. A way for a charismatic leader to control a superstitious, isolated population. Still, it was creepy. The way he said “The Treeline is not a wall; it is a membrane” sent a shiver down my spine.

I kept working. More sermons, recordings of town festivals, children singing unsettling nursery rhymes about "Old Man Root" and "The Whispering Birch." Then I found a tape that was different. It wasn't labeled with a date or event. Just a single word: “Testimony.”

It was a woman's voice. She was speaking in a hushed, terrified whisper, so close to the microphone that her breath fogged the recording. The tape was badly damaged, full of static and strange warping sounds, but I managed to isolate her voice.

Unnamed Woman: …my name is Eleanor Vance. My boy, Daniel, he’s… he’s gone. It’s been three days. Silas said he broke the Covenant. He said Daniel went past the old stone marker near the creek. He said Daniel… answered.

(She breaks down, sobbing. The sound is distorted, raw.)

Woman: Silas told us not to look for him. He said what the woods takes, it keeps. He said Daniel is part of the tithe now. But last night… last night I heard him. He was calling for me. From the trees. “Mama,” he said. It sounded just like him. My Daniel. But… it wasn't right. The way he said it. It was… stretched. Like the word was too long for his mouth.

(A long pause. Only the sound of tape hiss and something else. A low, rhythmic clicking sound in the background. I thought it was an artifact from the tape damage at first, but it was too regular.)

Woman: I didn't answer. I put the pillow over my head and I prayed to a God that Silas says doesn't live here anymore. I heard it all night. “Maaaamaaaa.” Calling from the dark. It’s not my boy. It’s just his voice. It’s just a lure. Silas says it’s a lure. Oh, God. The woods want in.

After I finished digitizing that tape, I packed up early. I didn't want to be in the basement anymore. As I was locking up, I thought I heard something from the speakers on my workstation. A faint clicking sound.

I told myself it was just feedback. Just the sound of old machines settling.

I have another hundred tapes to get through. I’ll post an update when I find something else. I need to know what happened to these people. I need to know what they were paying a tax to.
