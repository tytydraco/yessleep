The house was a steal. That should have been the first red flag. A three-bedroom craftsman with a wraparound porch for less than the cost of my cramped two-bedroom apartment. It was in a quiet, secluded subdivision called "Maple Creek," where all the lawns were impossibly green and the neighbors waved with all five fingers.

The HOA president, a woman named Carol with a smile as bright and hard as a porcelain doll's, met me on my first day. She handed me a welcome basket with a bottle of cheap chardonnay and a single, laminated sheet of paper.

"We're so glad to have you, Mark," she said, her eyes crinkling in a way that didn't seem genuine. "We're very relaxed here at Maple Creek. We don't have rules about lawn height or fence colors. We only have one."

She tapped a perfectly manicured nail on the laminated sheet. On it, in a large, friendly font, were the words:

**Rule #1: If you see a pet that appears lost or in distress, do not approach it. Do not feed it. Do not let it into your home. Go inside, lock your doors, and ignore it until it has gone.**

I laughed, thinking it was a joke. "What, are the raccoons organized crime around here?"

Carol's smile didn't waver. "It's not a suggestion, Mark. It's the only thing we require of you. It is for the safety and harmony of the community." Her tone was light, but her eyes were deadly serious. It was the first time I felt a chill in the warm afternoon air.

For the first month, it was perfect. Quiet. Peaceful. I almost forgot about the bizarre rule. I’d see people walking their dogs on leashes, cats sunning themselves on porches. They were clearly owned, clearly where they were supposed to be. The rule seemed like a weird quirk from a bygone era.

Then came the storm last night.

It was a real gully-washer, with thunder that shook the windows and rain that came down in sheets. It was around midnight when I heard it, a sound that cut through the noise of the storm. A pathetic, high-pitched whine.

I peered through my living room window. Huddled under the eave of my porch, shivering and soaked, was a golden retriever. It was beautiful, with big, sad eyes and a leather collar, but no tags. Every time the thunder cracked, it would press itself against my door and cry.

My heart broke. The laminated card was sitting on my counter, and Carol's words echoed in my head. *Go inside, lock your doors, and ignore it.*

But how could I? It was just a dog. A scared, lost animal. What was the worst that could happen? I’d be breaking some stupid, arbitrary rule from a power-tripping HOA president.

So I did it. I opened the door.

The dog practically fell inside, shaking a puddle onto my hardwood floor. It looked up at me with such gratitude, nudging its wet head into my hand. I got it a towel and a bowl of water, and it immediately settled down on my rug, letting out a contented sigh. I felt a wave of relief. See? Just a dog.

I fell asleep on the couch watching TV. I was woken up a few hours later by a sound that wasn't the storm.

*Knock. Knock. Knock.*

A slow, deliberate knock on my front door. The rain had stopped. The dog on the floor lifted its head, let out a low growl, and then, strangely, trotted to the door, its tail giving a single, lazy wag.

I looked through the peephole. Standing on my porch was a man. He was tall, impossibly tall, dressed in a neat, old-fashioned suit, like a door-to-door salesman from the 1950s. He was smiling, a wide, friendly smile that showed too many teeth, all of them perfectly straight and white.

I opened the door a crack, my hand still on the chain. "Can I help you?"

"Good evening," the man said, his voice smooth and pleasant. "I do apologize for the late hour. I believe you've found my dog?" He gestured with his head toward the retriever, who was now sitting patiently at his feet, looking up at him.

"Oh, yeah, he was out in the storm," I said, my relief making me feel foolish for ever being scared. "Glad you found him."

The tall man's smile widened, stretching his face in a way that felt unnatural. "He has a habit of getting out. He's a bit of a rascal." He leaned forward, his eyes, dark and unblinking, locking onto mine. "But he's very good at his job."

My blood ran cold. "His... job?"

The man chuckled, a dry, rustling sound. He reached down and patted the dog's head.

"Of course," he said, his gaze never leaving mine. "His job is to find the kindest person in the neighborhood."

He straightened up, his towering frame seeming to block out all the light from the porch.

"Thank you so much for your hospitality," the man said, his smile finally reaching his eyes, which now glinted with a terrifying, hungry light. "He likes you very much. He's decided he wants you to meet the rest of the family."

My mind screamed at me to slam the door. *Slam it, lock it, run!* But my body wouldn't obey. I was a statue, my hand frozen on the door. The man's smile never faltered as he gave the door a gentle push. The brass security chain didn't snap or break. It stretched, elongating like taffy with a soft, metallic groan before falling away, limp and useless.

"There now," he said pleasantly. "That's better."

He didn't enter. He simply took a step back and gestured with an open palm toward the street. It wasn't a command. It was an invitation. And for reasons I can't explain, I found myself stepping out onto the porch. The golden retriever trotted ahead of us, its tail held high.

The air was different out here. The storm had washed everything clean, but the world felt muted, like I was looking at it through a pane of smoked glass. The streetlights cast long, distorted shadows that seemed to writhe and twist at the edges of my vision. As we walked, I noticed other things.

A sleek black cat emerged from beneath a hedge, its eyes glowing with a faint phosphorescence. It fell into step beside the retriever. A few houses down, a parrot was perched on a mailbox. It didn't squawk or speak; it just swiveled its head, tracking our progress in perfect silence. They were all moving with us. An honor guard of silent, watchful animals.

I looked at the houses we passed. Through their big picture windows, I could see my neighbors. They were frozen in place, like mannequins in elaborate dioramas. One family was sitting around a dinner table, forks raised halfway to their mouths. In another house, a man was stopped mid-stride, one foot hovering over the floor. They were all facing our direction, their faces blank, their eyes wide and vacant.

"Don't mind them," the tall man said, noticing my gaze. "They're very good at following the rules."

We were heading toward the end of the cul-de-sac, to the oldest house on the block, a large colonial that had been dark and seemingly empty since I'd moved in. As we got closer, I could feel a low vibration through the soles of my shoes, a deep hum that seemed to emanate from the house itself.

The golden retriever led the procession up the walkway and sat patiently before the heavy oak door. The other animals formed a silent, semi-circle behind us, their eyes all fixed on me.

The tall man walked to the door. It swung open before he touched it, revealing nothing but a deep, impenetrable darkness inside. The low hum grew louder, resonating in my bones. It sounded like a purr. A gigantic, hungry purr.

The man turned to me, his smile as wide and terrifying as ever. He gestured into the blackness.

"After you," he said. "They've been so looking forward to this."
