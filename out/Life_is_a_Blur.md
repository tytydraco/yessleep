I don’t know how to begin to tell the horror I’ve been dealing with lately so I’ll start from the beginning. A little over 3 years ago my sight went fuzzy so needless to say learning to adapt to a new world that is constantly out of focus has been very difficult. In order to adapt to my new world I had to turn my phone blind mode on so anywhere I touch on my screen it repeats back what I’ve touched then from there I double tap to select it, the camera works similarly but it has a cool feature ( at least I thought it was cool) on it is it will tell me when a face is detected and how many faces there are, so this is where the problem started. 

A little over 2 weeks ago I was trying to take a selfie ( I live alone) to send to my gf when I turned on the camera I heard the normal “One face in frame” but before I took the picture I heard “Two faces in frame” thinking that maybe my gf was surprising me I call out her name and reach for hand but I hear nothing and feel nothing next to me. Feeling a little worried, I think that maybe the camera made a mistake. I turn it back on and I hear the usual “One face in frame” I snap the photo and send it to my girlfriend. A week later I had chalked up the first instance as a mistake and I went to take another photo and hear “One face in frame”. I go to take the picture when I feel a presence next to me and hear “Two faces in frame.” Slowly the hairs on my neck begin to prickle. “Hello?” I feebly call out into the fog. I see a blur cross in front of me. Terrified, I called out my girlfriend’s name “Rachel!?!” The blur comes back and stands in front of me. I hear and feel its breath, “Two faces in frame” sounds and the blur dashes off into the fog. Scared out of my mind I call my girlfriend, she rushes over and searches my apartment. Finding nothing she calms me down and spends the night with me. 

This leads us to today, I woke up in a cold sweat already feeling on edge. I could’ve sworn I heard a voice but I didn’t hear anything now, my apartment was dead silent. Believing it might’ve been my dream, I try to go back to sleep when I hear “Two faces in frame.” Frozen in fear I hear my phone repeat, “Two faces in frame.” The lights click on and slowly I look towards my phone when I hear again “two faces in frame.” In the now illuminated fuzz, I see 2 figures silhouetted from the light. “Two faces in frame.” My phone repeats. The lights cut off and I’m plunged back into darkness. I hear footsteps then silence, suddenly I feel and hear the breath of something hovering directly above me. My brain goes blank and all I hear and feel is this creature's breath. “Two faces in frame.” Sounds off again but this time it sounds deafened and skewed. A car horn goes off and I hear every person or creature dash out of my room. I get up, run, slam and lock my door. I grab my phone and jump into bed. As I’m typing this I hear them slamming on my door. I hear the voices of my family and my girlfriend coming through the door.
