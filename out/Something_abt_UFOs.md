The next morning is Monday, the day of the feast of Saint Garfield, the holy day of capitalism, and I’m not at work. The air smells like ozone. I’m wearing minimal makeup and my hair in a loose ponytail. Quinn and I are standing in front of restaurant I think it’s supposed to be open but no one is in there, dark booths and a locked door. Above us, the clouds seem too close and too dark. 

“I thought this place was open.”

“It’s one hundred percent not open,” I say. 

“Do you have MysterEat on your phone?”

“Yeah.” I say and open the app. The load screen says it spends its time dreaming of  finding restaurants for terminally undecided individuals. When I open it it’s already asking if it has permission to sync my account with my friend. 

I say yes and it reads my location and places I’ve been. The software hums and learns all it wants to know about the two of us. It asks to use our cameras, our microphones, to see our pictures. Why does it want to know everything in exchange for the name of a restaurant? 

Who does it sell all of our information it takes? How can advertising information be so valuable that an entire economy seems based upon what links I’ve clicked and when I’ve clicked them? 

Or does it want to know all of that for another reason? 

Does all this go into a ledger somewhere, a book filled with all our kinks and desires, our disgusts and our daydreams, waiting to be read someday by everyone? Our browser history is a sort of saint Peter at the gates. 

The app tells us to go a twenty four hour noodle place: Noodlesomnia. It’s only a few blocks away so we walk, the streets full of everyone, a spring jitteriness in the air pollution air, boys walking past us in white crocs and high shorts, girls with bright make up and dead eyes. We glide through the brunch peacock crowds as anonymous as egg avatars on Twitter. The wind is rushing like it has to be everywhere at once and the sun high and directly above is an overwhelming, inescapable force. There are no shadows on the concrete. It’s a dead zone. 

There’s a person on cardboard on the sidewalk who asks us, anyone, everyone, for money. Everyday there are more people on the street while somehow every square inch of the surrounding area is being flattened and transformed into new real estate developments where one bedroom condos go for one point two million dollars while people sleep on cardboard in the capital of America. I pretend to not notice the person on cardboard and so does Quinn. We keep walking. 

In the middle of a sea of people, waiting to cross the street, I scan faces to see if I recognize anyone. Men try to make eye contact with me but I flick away from their gaze, feeling like I’m on a dating app and not swiping. 

“I’m sorry I vanished on you yesterday.” 

“It’s okay. Stuff happens.” 

She texted me this morning, asked to met for breakfast and hadn’t said anything else. 

“So, I’m on the sixth floor.” 

I stop walking. 

“Shut up.”

“I’m for real,” she says.  “Keep walking.” 

“Oh. My. God.”

“Dude, I know.”

“Is that what happened the other day, when they grabbed you?”

“Yeah, I thought I was getting fired.”

“I thought they were going to kill you,”  I say. “Take you to a black site, torture you, I don’t know. Anything seemed possible.”

“That could still happen, I suppose.”  Her voice isn’t her typical fried monotone. Instead there’s a hint of emotion. I don’t know what happened to her, but something did. 

“Quinn. I can’t believe this at all.”

“It feels unreal.”

“So what happens on the sixth floor,” I realize I’m whispering. 

“I can’t tell you,” she says, smiling, not looking at me.

“Are you joking?”

“I signed a NDA.” 

“We all sign things. Terrible things! All the time. Have you ever read the terms and conditions to things you agree to? It’s terrible.”

The walk symbol glows and we enter the intersection. My phone says we’re two minutes away from the noodle place.

“I get it, I do. It seems crazy we can’t talk about it. But whenever you come up, then we can.”

“What do you mean?”

“Exactly what I said. At some point you’ll be up there with me and then we can talk.”

I feel cold in spite of the humidity. 

“As soon as some leaves and they have an opening. Then it’s someone from the fifth floor who gets called up. I’m sure it will be you.” She’s casually watching the crowds, like she’s looking for someone. Or maybe making sure no one is looking for her.

“Why do you think the person left?”

“Which person?”

“The person who left the sixth floor. Why would you leave?”

The app dings. Corner of Florida and 11th. Noodlesomnia. 

“I don’t know. They must have had a good reason.” 


******

Inside, it’s antiseptic industrial chic with exposed metal and laminate flooring. A timer starts in my head for when it will look dated and absurd. 

The menu is complex, with multiple options and a bafflingly long list of protein substitutes, and displayed on an LED screen behind the monitor of a remote cashier. They look happy and relaxed, wearing a headset, living in a different time zone, in a different hemisphere, being paid the smallest amount possible. 

Quinn steps forward to order and I check my phone. On a photo app I see people living completely fake lives, their faces smoothed out through vigorous digital editing, their surroundings a near simulation of existence. Thinking about what Drew was saying earlier, staring at their non-real lives thinking that maybe the reason he thinks people online aren’t real is because for so many of us right now reality feels very user dependent.

****

“What did you get?” I ask her as we walk to our seats. 

“Vegan Mei Fun. You?”

“Thai peanut with tofu. I hate how they have so many options here. It makes me feel like no matter what decision I make I’ll be disappointed.” 

“People like choices.”

“Do they?” We get to our table. “I don’t think they do.” 

“Maybe if you give people lots of lousy options it distracts from the fact that there isn’t one good choice.” She sits down across from me and grabs a wad of napkins. There’s a little placard that says the napkins used to be trees only take what you need. Provide the object to be used but tell everyone there’s a problem. Offload the responsibility. 

“Make people feel like if we made better decisions as consumers we’d be happier.” 

“So we make more decisions.” 

“Buy more things.”

“Repeat and happiness follows.”

She takes a bite. The emotion she had outside is gone again. She’s back to monotone vocal fry. I wonder if that version of her is just a mask, versus the other way around. There must be a reason society is obsessed with superheroes who all have secret identities.

“So on the sixth floor do you —“ I began but she cuts in. 

“I don’t mean to be rude but I really don’t feel like talking about it, and I can’t keep saying I can’t talk about it to you,” I say, in a kind of clipped rush. 

“For sure. I don’t mean to drive you crazy, it’s just —“

“I get it. I’d do the same to you. But I wanted to talk to you about something else anyway. My dad called me this morning,” Quinn says. 

“I thought you weren’t taking his calls?”

“I wasn’t. My therapist told me I should practice non-contact with her but he called from a blocked number.” She pushes her hair out of her face. “I never should have picked up.” 

“Nothing good has ever happened from answering a phone call. What did he say?” 

“He doesn’t really say anything. He rants. He’s into ranting. He’s a ranter. Ranting about bible verses, celebrities, underground tunnels. We haven’t talked in months, but it’s the same things he used to say. There’s a conspiracy, a darkness is on the land, but a new day is coming. He wants me on his side. The usual, really. Brain worms.”

“It’s not his fault he believe that stuff,” I say. “People spend a lot of money trying to get people like your dad to think stuff like that.”

“I know it’s not his fault, but at the same time it is? I mean, we’re all responsible for decoding the world.”

“This isn’t the world he was born into,” I say. 

Behind Quinn someone gets up to throw away their trash and her eyes dart nervously in their direction. She turns back to me, points with a chopstick. 

“I want to tell him he’s nuts — and he is, he believes in things that are batshit crazy — but he isn’t wrong that things aren’t normal anymore. Information has become  weaponized and everything has been turned into information. He thinks he’s in a war, and he is, but it’s not the kind of war he thinks it is. He’ll never understand it. And I can’t just say, hey you’re wrong, because that feeling he gets, that there is something under the surface? He’s right. There is something there.” 

“He’s wrong about what it is, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t anything there.” 

Quinn grew up with her mom in dad in Michigan, an hour and half way from Ann Arbor. She was an only child, he was a loan officer and her mom a paraprofessional for an elementary school. They had a house with four bedrooms and four bathrooms, even though that was too navy bathrooms and too many rooms for three people. She had a My Little Pony birthday party every year until she turned seven and her mom stumbled upon Brony culture online. Then she started having Elsa theme parties. 

A year after that, in 2009, her dad lost his job selling adjustable rate mortgages for Americans who wanted to buy bright and shiny McMansions but now couldn’t. His drinking, long a casual hobby, became a dedicated action for him, an Olympic sport. Their living room became instead his sort of battle station, his fortress of solitude where he sat on the couch and drank watching cable news television. The  at high volumes. The house begin to lose its sense of self. Never a big fan of Obama, he starred becoming militantly anti-Obama, wondering darkly about his citizenship. Was he a real American, he’d ask eight year old Quinn.

I’m not sure, she’d say. He’s the president so I think he’s an American?

I don’t even know if he was even born in America, her dad would say. He’d finish his beer, go to the kitchen, grab another. 

You have to be born in America to be president, eight year old Quinn would say and he’d nod, take a few drinks. 

You do, he’d say, but I think he’s lying. 

They moved soon afterwards, because they also had an adjustable rate mortgage and their house was under water. 

What does that mean, Quinn asked.

It means we owe more on the house than it’s worth, her mom, perpetually frazzled and persistently medicated on anti-depressants, said. 

I thought it meant there was going to be a flood, Quinn said and her dad laughed. 

One day there will be, Quinnlet, he said, finishing another beer. One day. 

They moved into a townhouse that only had one and a half bathrooms that was in the same school district but felt different. She had a long bus ride now and listened to emo songs on her commute. 

In high school her mom died. A drunk driver ran a red light. She was dead before quiin and her dad got to the hospital. 

At that moment she realized that not only was nothing guaranteed in life, life could also be terrible. 

When she told me that story — racing to the hospital, worried her dad was drunk driving her there but numb to the ironic potential until getting there, walking into the registration desk, her dad saying her mom’s full name — Eleanor Abernathy — not mom — the nurse’s face, then the doctor walking out, his mustache, his combover, his glasses with faded brown frames and his bored monotone as he said she was dead  — I broke down. It was junior year, we were living together, in Pittsburgh, a few months after we had been able to return to campus, after COVID restrictions had loosened. 

She reached out to comfort me, saying she hadn’t meant to upset me, saying she knew about my dad (everyone knew about my dad) and how hard it must be to hear about something like that. I pushed her away and said I was sorry, that I hadn’t meant to get so upset, a tourist in someone else’s grief, but I didn’t tell her the reason I was crying.

It wasn’t about my dad dying in a car crash at two am in California, his car traveling over ninety miles an hour on a desolate stretch of road outside of Monterey, colliding into a shoulder rail without once touching the brakes, the car a fired rocket into the pacific, him likely dead even before the car landed. 

No, it was remembering being in the car with mark almost a year ago, him visiting me, driving into Pittsburgh,  merging into another lane to go through the tunnel and the car in the other lane appearing out of nowhere. The collision, the noise, the shattered glass across the floor of the car. His face when he said I was alive. The way I felt when I touched my bleeding check and said, am I? 

“He talked to me about your dad,” Quinn says and I’m jolted out of my thoughts. 

“Really? What did he say?”

“He said your dad found aliens but it turns out they were really angels coming to save America. That’s why he was killed.” She leans forward a little across the plastic table. “Did he really believe in aliens?”

“One hundred percent. He thought they were real and coming here or maybe that they had already been here. He had zero doubts.” 

“If aliens were real, they would never come here.”

“Why?” 

“Isn’t it obvious? Why would they want to come here? The world’s ending.”  

She finishes her drink and then her eyes go wide.  

“Jesus,” she says. “I just thought of something. All these crazy people calling your mom?”

“Yeah?”

“What if one of them was my dad calling her?”

We both stare and I don’t know who starts laughing first but in a rush we are both guffawing, slapping the table. Quinn is able to speak first: 

“Excuse me, ma’am, I believe our daughters are best friends and you are a devil worshiper.”

“Has your daughter “ i wheeze out and then can’t continue. 

“Your daughter,” gasps Quinn, “I think they know—“

“They’re in the plot,” I manage to say and then both of us are incapable of speech, laughing until crying while fellow diners ignore us completely. 

*****

Later, we go to work. Take the elevator up together, Jacob’s Ladder all around us, me to the fifth floor and then she keeps going. 

I log into my computer. Immediately the alerts start. Post after post of hurt people, dying animals, abused children. I delete and send warnings and flag things. Are the people in these videos dead? I watch one where a man in ruined clothing sings while bleeding from his neck. Someone is shouting instructions to him from off camera. I flag the image as “gore,” as “violence” as “inappropriate.” I try to will myself to forget the image. I try to tell myself I didn’t see it. 

If the man in that video is dead (and he must be) is this eleven second long clip of his dying his ghost?

More alerts, more atrocities. I keep clicking, keep wondering how so many people exist who want the world to see things like this. 

Or his ghost my memory of that moment? 

I’m trying to lose myself in data. Let the waves of information break over me until I’m in the green room, the space you can ride in the wave, water all around you, but you some how not in the water. 

The man on the elevator didn’t really say my name, I tell myself again. He just said something that sounded like it. I tell myself I can believe me. I can trust me. 

An alert flares. Someone posts a live streamed mass shooting from a few years ago. Thirteen kills, the caption reads. I flag it, mark it for deletion. Terms of service, I type. feel nothing at all.

I leave late, catch a car home. The driver is talking to someone on Bluetooth the entire time. Headlights from other cars splash against me on the inside. I open  my phone, text my mom. She’s at a friend’s house, having dinner. I look at my feeds. Someone I don’t know is missing. I’m not friends with him but multiple people I know are. I look at his face, his page, the algorithm feeding me posts about him, pictures of him, people asking for help. Last seen, last wearing. As I scroll through the raw desperate grief I’m trying to decide if I recognize him. He looks familiar but in a way so many people do. Everyone blends together and then something happens to us our social media turns into a digital space for people to plant flowers and say how much they miss us, how much they care. 

Outside the window the landscape looks like it’s on repeat: upscale grocery store, gym, juice bars, phone store, refurbished industrial-esque condos. Then juice bar, phone store, upscale grocery store, gym.  It looks like reality is spamming itself. Repetition. Capitalism glitches. After a ten minute ride I’m at my apartment building. I get out and the driver continues his conversation with digital ghosts as I walk in, take the elevator. My hands shake as I unlock my  door.

Lights on. I walk over to the futon in the living room and reach under it, fumble until I feel something rubber banded against the metal bars of the frame. 

I pull out an old flip phone with a piece of paper taped to it. I open it, and see that there's still charge left. I dial the number written on the paper. 

“Hey,” I say when someone picks up. “I need to talk.”

“Tomorrow, time N, place T,” someone says then a beep, then a dial tone. 

I power off the phone and rubber band it back to the frame. There’s a paper there with letters and numbers. I look for N and then T, stare at them till I’ve memorized it then crumple up the paper. 

Walk to the sink. 

Turn on the water. 

Flick the switch so the garbage disposal starts to spin. 

I drop the paper with the phone number into the steel teeth of the knives and it disappears, going from existence to nothing at all as I watch.
