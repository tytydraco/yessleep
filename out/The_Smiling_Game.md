"Smile for me," the girl in 14B whispers through paper-thin walls. She's been whispering it for three hours now, ever since the power went out in our apartment building.

I know her name is Sophie. I know she's eight years old. I know she disappeared six days ago, which is why I almost called the police when I first heard her voice.

Almost.

But there was something wrong with how she said those words. Something wrong with how the whispers seemed to come from inside my own head as much as through the wall.

"Smile for me," she giggles again. "Like how mommy smiled. Like how the man with the long fingers made her smile. All the way up to her ears."

The emergency lights in the hallway flicker, casting strange shadows under my door. I check my phone again â€“ still no signal. Outside, the city is a void of darkness. No streetlights, no car sounds, no signs of life except the occasional distant scream.

"I can teach you how to smile properly," Sophie says, closer now, as if she's standing right beside my bed. "The man with the long fingers taught me. It only hurts for a minute. Then you smile forever."

I know I shouldn't look. But I do.

Sophie stands in my doorway, though I never heard the door open. Her smile... God, her smile. It stretches literally from ear to ear, the skin split and peeled back to reveal rows of teeth that go all the way to the back of her skull. Behind her stands a figure so tall it has to bend nearly double to fit under my ceiling. Its fingers drag along the floor, leaving wet marks that gleam in the emergency lights.

"See?" Sophie says, her ruined face moving wrongly. "The Smiling Man fixed my face. Now I can smile pretty for pictures. Want to see my pictures?"

Polaroids begin sliding under my door, hundreds of them, more than could physically fit through the gap. Each shows a different person mid-transformation â€“ their faces being stretched by those impossibly long fingers, their screams turning into permanent grins.

I recognize some of them. The neighbors who've gone missing over the past week. The police who came to investigate. Sophie's mother, her eyes wild with terror as her face is carved into an eternal smile.

"Everyone's playing the smiling game now," Sophie says. "The whole building. Want to see?"

I hear doors opening up and down the hallway. Footsteps. Dozens of them. The wet sound of stretched skin and exposed teeth.

"Even the people who tried to run are smiling now," Sophie continues. "The Smiling Man can reach so far with those long fingers. He can reach right through phones, through cameras, through screens..."

My phone lights up. One bar of signal. A text message appears:
"ðŸ˜Š"
Then another: "ðŸ˜Š"
And another: "ðŸ˜Š"

Photos start appearing â€“ selfies from everyone in my contact list. In each one, their smiles stretch wider, wider, impossibly wide...

"Don't worry about deleting them," Sophie giggles. "The Smiling Man already sent them to everyone they know too. And those people sent them to everyone they know. Right now, millions of people are learning to smile properly. Isn't it wonderful?"

My laptop screen flickers to life despite the power outage. My phone's camera opens on its own. In both screens, I see my own face, but something's wrong with the image. My reflection is smiling, even though I can feel that I'm not. The smile grows wider as I watch, the skin beginning to split...

"The best part about the smiling game," Sophie whispers, her breath cold against my ear, "is that once you start playing, you can never, ever stop."

I feel long fingers wrap around my head from behind.

"Smile for the camera," Sophie says. "You're about to go viral."

The emergency lights go out.

In the darkness, I hear the wet sound of skin tearing, feel something pulling at the corners of my mouth. My face burns as it stretches, stretches, stretches...

But Sophie's right.

It only hurts for a minute.

Then you smile forever.

And the game spreads.

If you've read this far, you've been playing without realizing it. Check your phone's gallery. Look at your recent selfies. Has your smile been getting wider? Can you feel the skin around your mouth starting to get tight?

Don't worry. The Smiling Man's fingers are gentle at first. By the time it really starts to hurt, you'll be too busy smiling to care.

After all, everyone's playing now.

Can you feel your lips starting to curl?

That's okay.

Just smile.

Smile.

S m i l e.

Don't look behind you. Those long fingers are already reaching for your face. But if you smile wide enough, maybe it won't hurt as much when...

Oh.

You looked, didn't you?

Well then.

Let's play.
