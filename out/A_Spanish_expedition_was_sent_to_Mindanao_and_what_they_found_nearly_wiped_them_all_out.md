I was fortunate enough to take part in Sargento-Mayor’s expedition to clear the northern coast of Mindanao of the barbaric Moro pirates. I must admit that I was very grateful to join this expedition and get out of Manila. Ever since my arrival to this Pacific colony, life has been nothing but boring. Sometimes I felt that I have been tricked into going here, as the career of a military officer in these infernal islands lacks the glory and excitement one would see while serving in Europe or the trade ships crossing the Atlantic.

The monotonous life of garrison duty offered no moment of action for me and my fellow officers. The soldiers below us may enjoy the taverns and brothels outside the city walls, which many of them frequent nightly, but us gentlemen have nothing but lonely drinking parties in our quarters. Not even the extravagant feast thrown by the Governor-General excites us anymore.

That is why the expedition was received well by us, as we were presented with an opportunity to make a name for ourselves against the Moros.

The Moro threat has been a thorn in our endeavors in these islands for decades now. Every year, they send out great pirate fleets to attack our settlements, with some contingents reaching as far as Luzon. However, this season’s attack seemed to be worse than the previous ones.

Throughout this year, these savages have been pillaging our settlements in the Visayas islands, burning churches and taking natives captive in order to be sold into slavery. This caused panic and fear to both the European and native population of the islands. Such fear has gotten to the point that the towns in southern Luzon kept on reporting that Moro war fleets were appearing on their coast, despite no attack actually befalling them. 

Infuriated by these raids and the chaos and disruption it was causing on the peaceful lives of the population, the Governor-General decided to finally resolve the issue by sending a strong military force to ensure order and protection for the settlements and ships in the area. The expedition was to head for the northern coast of Mindanao, where the pirates often escaped to, and pacify them. This coast offered many riverways that led deeper into the interior, where their settlements and strongholds lay. It was often considered as a sanctuary by the Moro raiders, but now the Governor-General was determined to make a demonstration to show that it was not beyond the divine reach of his Majesty, the King of Spain.

My company of fifty arquebusiers was chosen to join this expedition, along with a fifty man company of halberdiers under Captain Don Pedro. However, the bulk of the expedition was to be composed of five hundred native levies from Pampanga, which was split into five companies, each under the command of trusted native chiefs. This expedition was to be led by the Sargento-Mayor, who had much experience against the Moros, for he had taken part in various expeditions to subdue the inhabitants of Mindanao in the past.

On March 1st, all soldiers and men took part in mass to bless our expedition and receive the divine protection of the Lord. Then, after taking part in a feast that the Governor-General prepared for us, we boarded twenty champans that had been allocated to us for the expedition. Once we were all loaded, we were once more honored by the inhabitants of the colonial capital, as they cheered our departure and wished us good fortune.

My arquebusiers were distributed among the twenty vessels of the expedition, in order to provide adequate firearms for each one. The waters to Mindanao were always hostile, with the occasional Moro pirate lurking in wait. Due to this, it was essential to have arquebusiers ready to aid the small cannons that the champans were already armed with. 

I myself boarded the flagship of the Sargento-Mayor, who was good company and graced me with his spare time by telling me stories of his previous encounters and exploits in Mindanao. Having never been to that island before, I was deeply engrossed at the knowledge he shared.

It was during this sharing of knowledge that he warned me of the dangers these islands hold.

“There are beings that lurk beyond God’s light there.” He told me. At first I thought he meant the hostile natives. However, I would later learn that there are threats more dangerous than natives in these islands.

After five days of sailing, our expedition arrived at the island of Pintados to receive further provisions. While there, we received news that two days before, a Moro raiding fleet attacked some villages in the southern end of the island. Because of this, the Sargento-Mayor ordered the hasty loading of supplies, in order for us to depart as soon as possible in hopes that we may intercept the Moro fleet. Despite our haste, after two days of circling the waters south of the island, we found no enemy ships. Realizing that the enemy must have slipped past us, the Sargento-Mayor ordered us to continue our journey to Mindanao.

By March 9, the expedition had arrived at the island of Cebu, where we were joined by ten caracoas and three hundred Visayan volunteers. With our large formidable force, we then sailed southwards towards the island of Mindanao.

On the night of March 10, the fleet approached the northern coast of Mindanao. We managed to land without resistance and quickly established a camp at an area that had a small natural harbor. Natives from nearby villages soon flocked towards our camp, as they observed from the treeline of the nearby jungle.

At first they were afraid of us, fearing that we came to bring them harm. However, eventually, some dared to approach us. After communicating to them through Father Rodriguez, who accompanied our expedition due to his knowledge of the languages used here, we were able to convey to the locals that we were only there to punish the pirates and if they would be willing to assist us in our endeavor. 

Impressed by our numbers and superiority in weaponry, many of these natives, especially the young adults, quickly volunteered to be our guides. Meanwhile, the village chiefs offered to supply us with food, as long as we promised to protect them from the monsters. Assuming that they meant the pirates, the Sargento-Mayor agreed to this and ordered contingents from the Pampanga levies to garrison their villages.

The next day, after making sure that our camp was well fortified, and after forging good relations with the nearby villages, the Sargento-Mayor led out a strong force to locate the camps and villages used by the hostile Moros. In his force were me and forty of my arquebusiers, the whole halberdiers company of Captain Don Pedro, and three hundred warriors from Pampanga. Meanwhile, the three hundred Visayan volunteers were left behind at the camp, in order to protect it in the event the pirates snuck past us and made a daring raid against it.

Marching out early in the morning, we were led by a young local guide, who boasted great familiarity on all the paths throughout the whole island. Taking us along a jungle trail, he warned us to stay alert, for evil creatures lurked in the area, watching our every move.

Although I did not believe that there were such creatures roaming the jungle, I still kept alert and told my soldiers to do the same. I could cast doubt on the possibility of evil creatures, but I would be a fool to think that the hostile Moros were not watching and waiting to ambush us.

At many moments during the march, we were forced to halt and fire our arquebuses at figures we saw hiding behind trees. All of us officers believed that these were enemy scouts trailing us, counting our numbers and gauging our strength. However, the murmurs from the lowly soldiers told me that they believed that these shadows were more than mortal men. They feared the warning given by our guide and allowed it to rot their heads and hearts. I simply shook my head at such ignorance, as I feared a sudden Moro attack more than a creature that did not exist.

By noon we halted our march at a portion of the trail that split into two directions. Consulting with our guide, the Sargento-Mayor, through Father Rodriguez, asked him where both directions led. 

The guide said that the path to the right led towards a river crossing, but warned that the river was guarded by a Moro fort, which was protected by an earth and wood palisade and armed with a considerable number of cannons. Meanwhile, the guide advised us not to take the route to the left, as it was known to be dangerous.

When asked if it was dangerous because of the ground it went through, the guide admitted that the ground in that trail was actually easy to pass through and would lead to another river crossing that was undefended. However, creatures called the Tigbanua inhabited the land along the trail and were known to prey on those who dared enter their territory.

After hearing the tale the guide said, me and Don Pedro could not resist but laugh at its absurdity. The Sargento-Mayor though was not in the same light mood as us and was annoyed at the guide’s attempt to dissuade us from taking a safer route. Immediately, he dismissed the guide and had another local lead us. 

At first, this new native seemed hesitant and almost unwilling to lead us through the trail on the left. It was only after he was reassured that a handsome payment awaited him if agreed did he finally relent. Even then, I could see an expression of fear in his eyes as he stood ahead of our column.

Moving along the new trail, we once again kept alert and ready to meet a possible enemy ambush. But none came and we assumed that due to their superstitious beliefs, they did not expect anyone to take this path. Despite this, our progress was still slow, as we kept on seeing shadows peaking through the trees and undergrowth, watching us as we went by.

It was during one of these halts that I spotted something strange. Recalling it now, I can still feel a chill run down my spine.

Looking towards the direction one of my arquebusiers unloaded his shot, I tried to see if what he fired at was a mere scout or a gathering enemy force ready to attack. Due to the thickness of the vegetation in the area, it was easy for any man, or body of men, to conceal themselves.

Eventually, I was about to give up on the effort and inform the Sargegento-Mayor that it was another false sighting and that we should continue the march. However, as I was about to turn my head, I saw a lone figure running in the distance. 

Placing my attention towards this figure, I noted that it was running away from us. This relieved me, as it must have meant that it was a scout heading back to his camp and not an attack ready to charge us. However, my sense of relief was suddenly lost when I noticed something strange about him.

The figure’s neck was extremely long, almost as long as his entire body. As I kept my attention towards him to make sure what I was seeing was true, the head of the figure twisted backward, so that his face was turned towards me. 

However, instead of turning left or right, the head moved upward until it was facing towards the rear. Seeing this made me jump back, as I ended up staring at the single yellow eye and terribly toothy smile of the figure. 

Panicked, I turned to one of my arquebusiers and asked him if he saw the figure too. When he asked me where, I pointed towards the direction I had been staring at, but it was now gone. Searching, I did my best to locate him, but he was nowhere to be seen. Unable to find any other sign of movement, I reluctantly gave up and informed the Sargento-Mayor that we were safe to continue the march.

During the rest of the march, I could not help but think what I had seen. I began to question myself and I pondered if my eyes had deceived me. A strong sensation in my heart told me that what I witnessed was true. But none of the men in my company said they saw anything during that halt. The fact the figure bent its head in an impossible manner also told me that I must have misinterpreted what I saw.

Eventually, I convinced myself that the fatigue I was enduring during the march was draining my senses to the point that a mere man running away was projected as something else.

We continued to move until sunset, when the Sargento-Mayor ordered a halt for the night. Asking the guide where we were, the local estimated that we were halfway through the trail. He said that if we moved quickly in the morning, we would be at the river crossing after a few hours' march. 

Satisfied with this information, the Sargento-Mayor dismissed the guide for the night and shifted his attention towards the organizing of a camp. Knowing that enemy scouts had been lurking in the sidelines all throughout the march, the Sargento-Mayor feared that they may have alerted local forces about our presence in this trail. If that was the case, then a hostile Moro force may have been sent against us and could conduct an attack while we rested for the night. 

In order to prevent ourselves from being caught by surprise, the Sargento-Mayor made sure to post men along the perimeter of our encampment. For the first watch, me and twenty of my arquebusiers would man the perimeter until midnight, where we will be replaced by twenty other men from my company.

Tired from all the marching, but unable to complain, I quietly nodded my acknowledgement of the order and moved to place my soldiers in appropriate positions that would screen the camp from attack. As the sun settled down the horizon and turned the jungle dark, I made sure to check each position my soldiers occupied, making sure that they were there and alert.

I would conduct such inspections every half hour until midnight approached. As the time for the changing of guard duty neared, I decided to conduct one more check on the men currently on the perimeter.

Visiting each one, I told them to keep their eyes open and that their replacements would soon come. I was nearing the last man on my route, I heard a sudden rustling from the ground in front of his position. Hearing the same sound, I saw the silhouette of my arquebusier stiffen, before going alert and pointing his weapon towards the direction of the sound.

Realizing that an attack was possibly coming, I drew my sword from its scabbard and prepared to stand next to the lone arquebusier in order to support him. However, before I was able to get close enough, a tall silhouette suddenly emerged from some tall grass and rushed towards the soldier in front of me.

Following the silhouette as it moved, I looked on with frozen fear as it resembled the form that I had seen during the halt. Seeing it move again, this time closer to me, I realized that what I saw earlier had indeed been true. 

Watching in complete horror, I felt myself unable to move, as the silhouette charged the arquebusier and tackled him to the ground. So fast was the movement that the soldier was unable to discharge his weapon before being shoved to the ground. 

The only warning he was able to give was the screams of fear he made, as I watched the unknown figure arc its long neck towards him and bury his head on the man’s neck. Hearing the pained cries echoing from him, I was able to briefly conquer my fear and urge myself forward to help a fellow man.

Gathering the remaining bravery within me, I readied my sword and advanced towards the creature that was attacking the fallen man. Raising my weapon and preparing to swing it down the long vulnerable neck of the evil being, I was about to attack when I heard a loud hiss to my side.

Turning towards that direction, I instinctively stumbled backwards when I saw another one of the creatures emerge from the tall grass and make its way towards me. Staring at it with fear, as the dim light of the Moon illuminated its form, I was able to see its large yellow eye stare at me with hunger, as its broad mouth gave me a smile that revealed its sharp teeth. There was no doubt that one bite from this foul beast would be able to tear off flesh.

In a brief moment of panic, I considered making a cowardly retreat. To turn back and run to the camp seemed to have been the best chance for survival for me. However, I quickly decided against this, as it would expose my back to my attacker. Instead, I decided to stand firm and, despite the fear within me, meet the charge.

The creature was running with its neck forward, as its head led the way. Waiting for it to get closer, I nervously stood my ground and rightly gripped my sword. 

Once the head of the creature was only a few feet ahead of me, I suddenly ducked down, allowing it to pass above me. Then, without hesitation, I stabbed my sword upwards towards its exposed neck. I had to use a lot of my strength in the thrust, as its skin was thick and hard to penetrate. Despite this, I was able to firmly place my sword in it, causing the beast to stop and let out a long hiss of pain. Keeping the sword in its neck, as its blood dripped all over me, I then began slicing through it until half of its neck was cut open. With a final hiss of pain, the creature then fell to the ground before dying.

Ignoring the blood that now soaked me, I got up and immediately glanced towards where my arquebusier had fallen earlier. However, it was already too late for him. Looking towards his direction, I could see the silhouette of the creature tear through him. With its long neck and arms, the creature ripped him apart, throwing limbs all over the jungle. There was nothing I could do now to help him.

Taking advantage of the distracted state of the remaining creature, I decided to retreat and run back to the camp. It was my intention to quickly reach camp and alert the men there of what had just occurred. But, as I was heading back as fast as I could, the sound of arquebuses suddenly firing caught my attention.

The burst of the weapons erupted from nearly everywhere and it soon dawned upon me that the whole perimeter guard was opening fire. For a moment I felt dread build up inside me. We were being attacked from all corners. The question was, was it the Moros or was it more of those terrible creatures? Deepi within me, I prayed it was the former.

As I got closer to camp, I could hear men shouting. Clearly the whole camp was awake by now. However, among the screaming was a sound that instantly disheartened me. It was the hissing of the creatures. To make things worse, I heard numerous hissing sounds coming from where the camp was. 

Upon reaching the edge of the camp, I quickly saw that what I feared was indeed occurring. At least a few dozen of the creatures had entered camp and were causing havoc. 

Everywhere I looked men were being attacked by the beastly creatures, who rushed all over camp, hungry for flesh. Trying their best to defend themselves, some of the soldiers had successes and were able to bring down their attackers. Most, though, were not as lucky, as they were tackled, bitten, and torn apart by the evil beings.

Realizing it was foolish to charge into camp without a plan, I held back for a moment and hid behind some thick underbrush. Observing from my position, I tried to locate the best place to head to. Ideally, I needed to find where all the soldiers were rallying.

This proved to be a difficult task, as it seemed that everyone was fighting their own battles.

From one corner of the camp, Father Rodriguez could be seen moving left and right, as he held out a banner that displayed the divinity of the cross. Despite the fear evident on his face, he bravely held out the banner against the creatures that were surrounding him. Unfortunately for him, these beasts cared not for our Christian symbols. Ignoring the banner, they charged at him and bit chunks out of his body.

Meanwhile, at another corner of the camp, I saw the Sargento-Mayor swing his sword against a beast in front of him. Bearing no armor on his body, I realized that he must have been asleep in his tent when the attack occurred. Due to his skill with the sword, he managed to evade an attack by the creature and stab it on the chest, thus successfully taking its life. But he had no time to celebrate his victory, for another creature rushed him from behind and bit him on the arm. In one swift move, the beast yanked his arm off, causing the man to fall to the ground. The creature then dove its head towards him and began tearing him apart.

Looking away, I did not have the courage to watch such a brave and respected man fall in such a gruesome way.

Only a few soldiers managed to gather and form up, but that did little to save them.

Near the center of the camp, some halberdiers were able to form a wall that held back the creatures in front of them. However, their flanks were too exposed and it did not take long for a few of the evil beings to rush them from the sides.

Other groups of men decided that a last stand was not the best idea and instead formed up to charge out of camp. The levies from Pampanga, led by one of the native chiefs, were one of these groups, as they fought their way towards the jungle. Although they were not successful in killing all the creatures that went after them, they at least managed to keep many at a distance.

Eventually, this group disappeared into the darkness, as a saw few of the creatures head towards the same direction.

Watching the chaos unfold before me, I wondered if I should head into the camp and rally the few remaining men, or if I too should leave while I could.

I was caught up in trying to decide what to do when I felt something tap me on the back.

Thinking that it was one of the beasts, I immediately held my sword out and prepared to defend myself. But to my surprise, instead of the hideous beings, I saw a native staring at me, fear and panic obvious on his face. It took me a while before I realized that the native in front of me was the first guide we had hired, the one who told us not to go down this trail.

Looking up at me, the native spoke in a tongue that I could not understand. For a few seconds I stared at him, wondering what he was trying to say. Frustrated at my unresponsiveness, he tried to gesture towards a path in the jungle. At that point I realized what he was trying to say.

He was trying to point out an escape route.

For a moment I hesitated to take it. I felt ashamed at the thought of abandoning the expedition. Glancing back to the camp, I saw that there were still a few men remaining. Desperately, these men tried to stave away the creatures. Despite their bravery, I realized that it was a hopeless cause. Their deaths were already sealed. But mine was not yet final. I still had an opportunity to survive.

Turning back to the guide, I noticed that he was no longer standing beside me. Instead, I could see his silhouette rushing towards the path he had pointed to.

With a heavy heart, I ran and followed him.

By morning, me and the guide found ourselves back at the crossroads that we had been at the previous day. Joining us there were a few other survivors from the camp, including the warriors from Pampanga that charged out, although they were fewer in number now. Among those missing was their chief.

All in all, there were around a hundred survivors from the massacre, with me being the only officer that remained.

Resting throughout the morining to regain our strength, we did our best to keep a watch out in case the creatures or the hostile Moros came out to attack us. To our relief, we were left to ourselves, although there were some sightings of a few creatures observing us from behind some trees and rocks.

By noon, I led the remaining men back to our camp near the shore. Arriving just before sunset, we were greeted with shock and confusion by the garrison we had left there. Captain Jose Enriquez, the European commander of the Visayan native volunteers, asked me what had happened. Exhausted and demoralized, all I could tell him was that we were ambushed by demons.

The next day, the men we ordered to garrison the nearby villages returned to camp and reported that they were forced to leave due to unrest from the locals. Word of our encounter in the jungle had reached them and they were angry that we had stirred the monsters. The locals now demanded that we leave so that we would not cause any more problems to them.

After consulting with Captain Enriquez, we both decided that to leave and return to Manila would be the best course of action. With our expeditionary force greatly diminished and low in morale, we would be unable to continue the original task of pacifying the pirates.

Abandoning the camp, the remaining soldiers of the expedition embarked on the boats and began to sail away. 

As we moved further and further from the shores of Mindanao, I gave one last glance towards it and prayed I would never see it and its evils again.

Upon our return to Manila, I was immediately taken to the Governor-General for questioning. After recounting the terrible events of that night, the Governor-General stared at me in disbelief. He then berated me for lying and told me that I was merely making excuses to cover up my cowardice.

Desperately, I tried to defend myself and told him that, under my honor, everything I said was true. He simply shook his head at this.

“You have no honor, Señor. You abandoned your men, and you abandoned the Sargento-Mayor. Now they are dead and you are alive to face your punishment.”

With that I was arrested and imprisoned under the charge of abandoning my post For five days and nights, I was left isolated inside a cell in Fort Santiago. As I sat there alone, I could not help but remember the Governor-General’s accusations. At that point I wondered if I was indeed a coward. There was no denying that I had abandoned the men in the camp. 

Initially, I had defended what I did by convincing myself that there was nothing I could have done to change the events that occurred. I had told myself many times that even if I was there, instead of watching from the sidelines, the camp would still have been overrun by those creatures. But as I sat alone in the cold damp dungeon beneath the fort, I could not help but feel guilty. Cursing myself, I realized that I should not have allowed my fear to control me that night. I should have fought beside the soldiers in the camp. I should have protected Father Rodriguez. I should have joined the Sargento-Mayor and covered his back. Their deaths may have been my fault indeed. 

At that point, I accepted my failure and knew that the only path left for me was execution.

However, as fortune would have it, I was eventually released on the fifth night of my imprisonment. As it turned out, the few survivors of the battle were also interrogated by the Governor-General, and each one of them stated that my claims were true. In fact, I was told that many of the survivors hailed me as a hero for leading the remains of the expedition back to safety.

With the testimonies of the other survivors matching my own account, the Governor-General was eventually convinced that what occurred, despite being unbelievable, indeed occurred. Upon my release, the Governor-General personally apologized for the doubt has casted upon me. He then promised to compensate me for the inconvenience that suffered through and that I would be given a new company to command as soon as the latest batch of replacements arrived from Mexico.

Once that was resolved, he then informed me that I was to remain quiet about the events that occurred that night. He explained that the colony was still in a state of panic over the continuous pirate raids that were occurring. This panic was affecting the way of life in these islands, as settlements kept on demanding for soldiers to protect them, while fishermen and traders were too afraid to sail in fear of being abducted by the pirates.

The Governor-General believed that if news of the creatures in Mindanao spread, then it would cause even more panic that would further cripple the colony. If such an event were to occur, it would reflect badly on him, the highest official in the colony, and the friars and influential citizens may demand for his removal

Quickly understanding what he was trying to convey, I wholeheartedly agreed and assured him that I would not talk about the events of that night to anyone. After having just been released from the dungeon, I was not going to dare disagree with the Governor-General and give him grounds to imprison me again.

A few days after my release, I was surprised to have a sudden visit from a few of the European soldiers who survived the battle in Mindanao. Arriving at my quarters and presenting to me a sword, they told me that they were grateful to me for having led them away from the jungle and the creatures that lurked there.

They then recounted that since they saw me covered in so much blood after the battle, they believed that I must have slaughtered many of the creatures that night. They then said that nobody else among the survivors had bloodied themselves more than me.

Unsheathing the sword they presented, I saw that its blade was engraved. ‘Cazador de Monstruos’, it proclaimed.

Embarrassed, yet grateful, I thanked them for the honor they bestowed upon me. They merely smiled and said that they thank me for leading them out of the cursed land of those creatures.

Now I sit here in my quarters and write this, the sword on the table next to me. Its presence torments me greatly. Although the Governor-General and the soldiers believed that I was a hero, I knew that I was nothing more than a coward. 

I did not deserve that sword, nor the title it proclaimed. 

I should have died in that jungle. I should have been punished for my cowardice.



\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



This document was kept hidden within our family’s personal archives. My grandfather created these archives in hopes of ensuring that our family history would not be forgotten. Collecting every document our bloodline has ever made, he made it his life’s mission to preserve the rich history of our name. He was proud knowing that future generations of the family would be able to read about ancestors and learn of their deeds.

Having alway had an interest in my family’s history, especially our involvement in the colonization of the Philippines, I asked my grandfather if he had documents about it. To this, he smiled and told me that this particular document was one that would be to my liking.

Yet, after going through it, what I read merely opened up more questions to me. At first, I wondered if what my ancestor had written was true, if he really did encounter creatures in those jungles. It seemed so unlikely. 

At first I couldn’t believe it and thought that my ancestor merely delved into fictional writing. My poor old grandfather must have mistaken this work for a truthful account.

However, as I looked around my grandfather’s personal library, I couldn’t help but notice something displayed on the corner of the room. Moving towards it, I looked on with shock, as I realized that what I read must have indeed been a truthful recounting of events.

What I saw was a long glass box, with an unsheathed sword inside of it. On the sword was an engraving that read: ‘Cazador de Monstruos’. Monster hunter.
