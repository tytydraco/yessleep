Many people asked me, "Zizy, why do you like to explore mystical and haunted places with boys? You're cute and sexy like an adult magazine model."

First of all, I take offense to being called ‘like an adult magazine model.’ I don't know why. Maybe it's because it makes me seem like I have no skills other than selling my body. In fact, there are a lot of adult magazine models who have many other skills, such as music or business. Secondly, those two statements are completely unrelated. Why do beautiful and sexy adult magazine models can't, or are not allowed to have hobbies or skills that guys do?

How sexist!

There were actually five of us, three men and two women. However, Erika, the other woman, never joined us in the field. She mostly takes care of the before-after, such as scouting locations, finding out information related to the data and history of the locations we will explore, then editing photos and videos for later uploading to social media.

Well, yes, she's a scaredy-cat too.

Erika never had a problem reading a book or watching a horror movie alone in the middle of the night. But when it comes to visiting strange places, even if she comes in a group, she'll always say, "no, thanks!"

But Erika was always on stand-by at the same time we were exploring. From behind the laptop in her room, she provided us with the additional information we needed. Admittedly, such an exploration could have ended badly. And it was Erika's job to be the first to call for help, an ambulance or the police, if things did go south. Or Feroz, the supernatural expert who was our mentor, if things, you know, ‘went south.’

Therefore, it's no wonder that Erika is barely recognized by our fans. Moreover, she rarely appears in our behind-the-scene photos and videos. This is because even in our behind-the-scenes sessions, she chooses to be in charge of holding the camera. Well, basically, Erika doesn't really like being in front of the camera. Even though my friend can actually be said to be beautiful and sexy like an adult magazine model.

Uh, one second. Why am I being sexist myself?!

Anyway, that's why our exploration videos only contain the four of us: Me, Rashka, Alex, and our beloved, unappointed leader, Kao Yun. Unappointed, because, despite every one of us agreeing to follow his direction, he refused to officially take the role.

And then, speaking of our battle gears, all four of us are equipped with DSLR and go-pro cameras respectively. Yep, we're professionals!

"The Crying Mansion? Whooo... Sexyyy\~" muttered Alex as Erika handed us the sheets containing data and historical information of the location we were going to explore later that night.

"Sexy how, you mean?" Rashka asked, sipping the warm chocolate in his cup.

"I don't know,  man. It just sounds sexy to me. The name. It sells. The Crying Mansion," Alex replied with a chuckle.

"An uninhabited house. It's spacious and grand. It has four floors, including one underground. After ten o'clock at night, residents around the mansion often hear crying sounds from inside the house," Kao Yun said slowly, while flipping through the sheets of information in front of him. "Interesting, but," he continued then as he turned his gaze back to Erika who was standing not far beside her, "haven't we ever explored anything like this before, Er?  I mean, a location where you can hear crying coming from inside."

"The one whose video we called 'Orphanage of the Phantom Children'?" I asked to confirm the location Kao Yun was referring to, it was a former orphanage, which took care of children up to the age of twelve. And the case is not just the sound of children crying. The sound of children laughing, the sound of children talking, playing, and running around is also heard there. Day and night."

"Yes, that one!" replied Kao Yun affirmatively, "but it's similar. There are voices in the empty building."

"It's not just a voice, Yun," Erika said, "read it all the way through!"

"It's not just the sound?" all four of us said at the same time as we turned our heads and looked at Erika intently, as a signal for her to explain instead of us having to read everything one by one.

Erika's facial expression looked a little annoyed, as if to imply, "Yeah, why did I print out all the documents if I'm the one explaining them in the end?" But this wasn't the first time the girl with the cute face and round glasses had gotten that look from the four of us.

"The courtyard is huge," Erika began to explain, "the distance from the roadside to the main house is relatively far, which normally would not be heard. But, anyone who passed by the house at night would have heard those crying voices very clearly. It wasn't like the wailing of children, but more like the sound of sobbing and crying. The sound of an adult crying. And it sounded like there were many different voices. A mix of male and female voices of different ages."

"The thing is," our friend continued, "the owner of the mansion is an eccentric man who is not married and has no children. From the history I know, during his lifetime, he lived in that house alone. He was almost never seen leaving the house, let alone interacting with the neighbors. Nor was he ever seen receiving guests, except..."

"Except?" asked Rashka.

"Except for the delivery men who come by a box car," Erika replied, "it's said that the man who owns this mansion likes to collect paintings. He buys antique paintings from all over the world to be displayed in his house."

"Ooooo... The house is filled with antique paintings?" Alex exclaimed excitedly, "It must be creepy in there."

"Then, there was one of the residents who happened to live not far from the luxury house, trying to fly a drone over a fence that was unusually high, almost like a fortress," our colleague continued, "just to take a peek at the window. Something that obviously can't be done by just standing outside the fence. And you should know, the drone's lens is equipped with a heat detector."

"He wanted to see if there were still humans living in there?" I asked.

 "Yep!" replied Erika quickly.

"Crazy!" Rashka exclaimed excitedly, "so, what did he find?"

"If he wanted to," Erika continued, "he could have smashed the glass of the house with his drone to explore inside the house, but he didn't want to get into trouble, so all he tried to do was fly his drone as close as possible to the biggest window in the house, and fire his flashlight and heat detector in there."

"Carry on!”

"The flashlight from his drone could not show the whole house clearly. It was too dark. But from what it could illuminate, it seemed that there were indeed framed paintings lining the corridors of the house. But, what the heat detector fired by the drone saw was unexpected."

"Did the heat detector pick up any life in there?" asked Alex, piqued by curiosity. "Yep!" replied Erika, "and not just one or two. The heat detectors detected living creatures in there, in numbers impossible to count. It almost filled the whole house. As he flew his drone a little further away, hoping that the drone's camera could capture a more complete visual of the house. You knew that when the drone was close enough to the window, the detector captured too much heat. He wanted to know how much heat was detected from the entire house."

"Is it many?" I asked, my heart pounding.

"Too many! He couldn't count the number! It seemed to fill the house from the basement to the top floor. He couldn't explain what was in there. But what he found at least explained how many crying voices could be heard over and over again."

I saw Rashka and Alex rubbing their hands together. Both of them seemed very excited about exploring the 'Crying Mansion'.

"Surprisingly," Erika continued, "these heat detectors usually detect 'heat' in the form of silhouettes. So, if a human or animal is caught by the detector, it would appear as a silhouette of a human or animal. But this one is different. What the heat detector saw was a reddish glowing ball of light.

"For additional information, the man who flew the drone into the mansion did so in 2016. And it was confirmed that the last time local residents saw the owner of the mansion leave the house, to pick up a package of paintings, was July 13, 1920. Since then, no one has ever seen him. He could have died inside his house. But, because of the unusually high fence that rises like a fortress, and the fact that the owner never interacted with anyone other than the delivery man,     no one wanted to, or dared to go in to make sure."

"So you're saying that since 1920 until now the house has been completely untouched by outsiders? And the whereabouts of the owner of the house cannot be confirmed because no one dares to enter?" asked Rashka.

"From the information I got, yeah!" replied Erika firmly.

"Those crying sounds," Kao Yun said, "when did they start? I mean, did they start only after the assumed death of the owner of the house, or..."

"Well, here! You'll love it!" our friend said excitedly, "the crying noises have started every night, after ten o'clock, even when the owner of the house is known to be alive. That's why no one dares to go near."

"Yo! Let’s go, guys! Let's gooo!" Rashka exclaimed excitedly as he tapped the table in front of him with the palm of his hand.

We wasted no time. As soon as it started getting dark, we drove our car towards the weeping mansion. The road in front of the house was not big, it was still in a rural area. It was therefore a stark contrast to see such a large mansion compared to its neighbors' houses, which were not even the size of the mansion's yard. Perhaps because of the legend of its creepiness, even though it has been decades, none of the surrounding residents have built their houses close enough to the mansion. The closest neighboring house to the mansion was at least a hundred meters away. Something natural, I guess. I mean, who wants to hear strange crying noises from an empty house, all night, every day?

We parked our car in an empty lot right next to the mansion. The grass was quite tall, and there were some big trees that could cover our car while we explored. Well, as if anyone cared that we'd broken into the haunted house.

With the equipment we had brought with us, we managed to climb up the wall of the mansion, which was just as described in the document Erika had shown us: unusually high, like a fortress. As soon as our feet landed on the inside of the house, we immediately activated the cameras that we had attached to our clothes. That way, the recording process would start immediately, and at the same time, Erika, who was watching from her home computer, could monitor our condition. As I said earlier, in our explorations, bad things could happen in there, and it was Erika's job to take rescue measures from the outside when they did.

"Wow!" Rashka exclaimed as we arrived at the inner side of the fence, "This house really looks magnificent and luxurious."

The house was indeed as it was described. Honestly, I was amazed by its splendor and luxury as soon as I landed my eyes on it. It was very large, with an aristocratic architectural design, making it seem antique and expensive. From where we were standing, we could clearly see that the house did have three levels up, and there was a very large balcony on the second floor, just above the terrace.

Because the surrounding streets were deserted and the closest distance to the neighbor's house was at least a hundred meters, plus it was already ten o'clock at night, we felt a strong sense of silence in there. And because of that silence, we could clearly hear the soft voices coming from inside the abandoned mansion. The eerie sounds that were the reason why we were there at that time. The sounds that we planned to be the centerpiece of the title video of our exploration that night.

"Huh? The legend is not a joke, is it?" said Kao Yun with a grin.

"I didn't expect the sounds of the sobbing to be heard this clearly from out here," I muttered back. We heard the crying voices very clearly. So clearly, we could tell that it wasn't just one, two, or ten people. The sobs sounded like they were coming from dozens, if not hundreds of people. There were sobs from women, men, the elderly, and even children, echoing each other. It was soft but very clear. I have to admit, I got goosebumps. The sound of those sobs sounded bitter and frightening.

"Those crying voices sound like... What is it called... I lost the words..." muttered Alex as we stepped closer to the porch.

"Like ghosts who are trapped in a place and can't leave, even though they want to?" said Rashka as he took out a prying tool from his bag, which he would use to force open the front door of the mansion.

"Yeah. Something like that. But not exactly. I just can’t put my finger on it..."

The closer we got to the porch, the louder the strange, eerie crying sounds became. Rashka started prying the front door open, and, crick! There was a sound that signaled he had succeeded.

"Zizy, as always," Rashka said to me, gesturing with his hand as if inviting me in, "ladies first."

"Thank you, gentleman," I said as I pressed the sole of my shoe against the door and pushed it so hard that the front door of the weeping mansion burst open.

The outside of the house was still quite bright because it was illuminated by the moonlight, which happened to be shining brightly that night, not covered by clouds at all. But the inside, because it had not been lived in for a long time, was pitch black and stuffy. Electricity and water must not have flowed there for decades. Quickly, we turned on the lights on our headlights, and lit the flashlights we held in each of our hands.

"Do you see it, Er?" I asked Erika, who had been online since we arrived earlier through the microphone on my communication device.

"Yep!" she replied briefly from the other side.

The first thing we did upon arrival was to shine our flashlights around the lobby of the mansion, trying to get a sense of what was there. It didn't take long for us to realize that the room was filled with paintings framed in golden-colored frames with artistic patterns. All the paintings we saw there were of people. There was not a single painting of landscapes, objects, or animals. All we saw were paintings of humans, in various costumes, ages, and characters. Some of the objects in the paintings looked like Europeans, others looked like Asians, of various ages. As far as we could see, all the humans in the paintings were dressed in the style of the 1900s, whether the paintings depicted Europeans or Asians.

The more we walked inside, the more clearly we heard the sounds of sobbing.

"Is it just me, or do these crying noises sound like they're coming from nearby? I mean, like... so close...," Rashka asked in a whisper. "I hate to admit it, but, well, I feel that way too," I said, "why the hell is that?"

"From past experience, it usually means that there are supernatural beings nearby," Alex said.

"And usually, we should have started getting 'attacked'," Kao Yun adds.

"The funny thing is," I said, "with the sounds of crying this close and loud, somehow I don't feel any signs that we're about to be attacked."

A split second later, I heard a click, like the sound of a light switch being turned on, and a moment later, blip! Some of the small lights around our room suddenly turned on. The four of us were shocked to death, and reflexively, looked around.

"Huh?! The lights are on?!" I muttered.

"Uh, sorry guys, I accidentally pressed the light switch," Rashka said as he pointed to the light switch that was not far from his hand that was touching the wall beside him.

"But this house should be empty, Rash," Kao Yun said.

"In the case of the orphanage we explored a while back, it still has an owner who takes care of the building. It's not surprising that there are still lights on," Alex continued, "but this house should have no owner. At least from the information we got, the only person known to be the owner should already be dead."

"Died in 1920, or thereabouts," I said, "today is 2023."

"Maybe he actually has relatives?" asked Rashka.

"If there really are relatives who take care of this house so that it is still installed with electricity, why is this house stuffy, dusty, damaged and full of cobwebs? It's as if no one has taken care of it for decades," I said again.

"Nothing," Erika said suddenly, from the other side of the communication device, "I've checked everywhere, even going as far as visiting the residents around here to ask further. I mean, if there really is an owner, even if they don't live here, we still need to ask permission to conduct our exploration. Just like we did with the orphanage exploration last month."

"And? Not a single relative?" Kao Yun asked Erika.

"According to the head of the neighborhood, there is none," our colleague replied, "all residents and homeowners in this area must be recorded, for the census and other things. There is no information about the owner of the house."

"In fact," Erika continued, "when I wanted to ask permission to explore the house, the head of the neighborhood specifically and explicitly stated that he didn't care if anyone wanted to break into the strange mansion. 'Go ahead and jump over the fence if you can. I, and the residents of this neighborhood, don't care about that creepy mansion. But, you're on your own. What happens to you in there is none of my business,' he said."

"Then it's valid, this house is empty?" asked Rashka to make sure. "Valid," Erika replied briefly.

"So who pays for the electricity?" I asked.

"And water...," Alex said quickly, turning the faucet on the sink not far from where he was standing. We simultaneously shifted our gaze to where Alex was standing. As soon as Alex turned the tap, water poured out of it.

"No kidding!" I exclaimed in a half-whisper, "if there's electricity and water, then there should be people!"

"Sometimes homeless people like to sleep in empty houses. They don't care if it's haunted or not," said Rashka again stupidly. "Yes, the homeless may sleep here, but then they also pay for the electricity and water? Rashka is sure has a brain!" I scolded with annoyance.

"Zy!" exclaimed Kao Yun as he nudged my arm, since I happened to be standing closest to him. When I turned to him, he signaled with his eyes to look up, towards the ceiling of the house.

"Shit! Guys! Look up!" I signaled Alex and Rashka as I look up.

The ceiling of the house is exceptionally high, probably around five or six meters. It looked like a typical grand building from the Dutch colonial era. Because of its height, we didn't realize it right away. And because some of the small lamps had suddenly turned on, we had enough light to see a lot of things inside the house. It wasn't too bright, it was dim, but it was enough for us to see around even without a flashlight in our hands. We thought that the paintings of people, were just lining along the walls of the house. The two sides of the walls of the house that were almost covered by paintings of various sizes were already strange enough, then we had to discover that not only on the walls, but the paintings were also displayed attached to the ceiling of the luxurious house. Almost the entire surface of the ceiling of the first floor of the mansion was covered by antique gold-colored framed human paintings of various sizes.

"What kind of person would display a framed painting to the ceiling of a house like that?!" Kao Yun exclaimed in astonishment.

The heads of the four of us looked up at the ceiling, trying to observe the paintings displayed up there facing down. The sounds of sobbing could still be heard softly but clearly enough. It did sound like the source of the sound came from near us. Then I realized something. With my forehead furrowed in curiosity, I slowly stepped closer to the row of paintings on the right side of the wall. I shone my flashlight towards the human faces painted there, framed with golden frames.

"What's wrong, Zy?" asked Kao Yun as she approached me. "Don't you feel it, Yun?" I asked.

"Feel scared? Yeah, pretty much," he replied.

"No! No!" I argued, "look at the paintings on the wall," I said to the three of them as I shone the flashlight in my hand on each face in some of the paintings, one after the other. "Do you feel it?" I asked the three of them again, "why do the sobbing sounds sound like they're coming from inside the paintings?"

For a few moments, none of us made a sound, just staring at the paintings in front of us, occasionally looking at each other in astonishment. We all agreed that the sobbing sounds did indeed seem to be coming from inside the paintings.

"Guys!" said Kao Yun, inviting the three of us to continue our journey. A few steps into the lobby of the house, which was absurd in size and grandeur, I realized that Rashka wasn't with us. Kao Yun and Alex were walking ahead of me, so as the one who was walking behind, I turned my head back. I saw Rashka staring at one of the paintings. It wasn't the one we had been looking at together. Another painting not far from the previous one. His head seemed to be leaning forward, his forehead wrinkled. He looked like he was observing something.

"Rash!" I called as I swung my flashlight at him.

"Oh, sorry!" said Rashka as he ran over to me. "That painting was weird," he said as he walked back beside me.

"The one we saw together earlier?" I asked.

"No, not that one. I mean the one I saw just now, before you called me."

"What's so weird about it?"

"So far, the paintings that we have seen, are dressed in 1900s-style clothing."

"Yeah. So?"

"The painting I was talking about, a painting of a young man, looked like he was about our age. His style of clothing is like the style of clothing of the current years. T-shirts, leather jackets, jeans and sneakers."

"In the 1900s there were also t-shirts, leather jackets, jeans and sneakers," Alex said without looking back.

"Indeed. But the silver necklace in the shape of the *Power Youth* logo emblem didn't exist in the 1900s," said Rashka. *Power Youth* is a community of adventurous young people that was first formed in 2017. The *Power Youth* community logo is in the shape of a shield, in the center of which there is a picture of a tree whose trunk and branches form the letter Y.

"Don't joke around," Kao Yun said calmly.

"Seriously, Yun. I'm not joking. I didn't bring my necklace, but I have it, so I remember the details of its shape and design."

"Okay, let's say that these paintings are not only from the 1900s, but there are also paintings from the current years, but how can a young person our age have his paintings displayed in this house? There's no way," Alex commented while occasionally swinging his flashlight left and right.

"Yeah, it's still impossible, Lex," Erika said from the other side of our communication device, "remember what I said earlier, that the last confirmed sighting of the owner of the house was on July 13, 1920. 1920, guys. There's no way he's still alive in 2017 to make a painting of someone wearing a *Power Youth* necklace."

"But I'm pretty sure it's the *Power Youth* necklace," Rashka insisted.

"Alright, alright. We'll check again while we're going out of this house later. We still have a long way to go. It will be too late in the morning," Kao Yun finally intervened.

"You guys will definitely nag me, tell me not to joke around, but I don't know why after seeing the painting with the *Power Youth* necklace, I suspect that the owner of this house might still be alive," Rashka said again quietly.

"There's a door," Kao Yun said as she pressed the doorknob in front of us and opened the door. The lobby *of* the mansion seemed to end there. At the end of it was a wall devoid of any decorations or paintings, except for a wooden door in the center.

When the door finally opened, the four of us were stunned to see what was behind it. In contrast to the lobby, what appeared behind the door in front of us was a narrow hallway, only about 2 meters wide at most. Along the walls on the right and left sides were paintings in the same style as the ones we saw in the lobby of the house earlier.

After Rashka, who was walking at the back, closed the door, we resumed our journey, walking down strange narrow hallways with blood-red wallpaper on the walls.

"A house this big, but behind this door is only a narrow, maze-like passage?" I wondered.

"The interior of the house was modified to look like a labyrinth," said Alex.

"For what?" I asked again.

"Good question," replied Kao Yun, whose answer did not answer my question at all.

"I can't help but think of the psychopathic serial killer who modified his house to look like a maze to trap his victims," Rashka said. I didn't want to say anything. Rashka had always been the one who made the most inappropriate comments at the most inopportune times.

Soon, our journey came to a halt as we came to a four-way intersection. We tried to explore with our flashlights and eyes, what might be in the hallway in each direction. Apart from the paintings perched on the wall, we glimpsed other bends and intersections along the hallway. So, for some reason, the owner of the house modified the interior of his house so that it became like a maze.

In situations like this, we tend to follow where Kao Yun decides to go. Hence when Kao Yun decided to turn right and go down the hallway on our right side, we all immediately followed without asking any questions.

"Oh, what's this?" I looked back at the sound of Rashka's voice. It looked like his foot accidentally nudged something on the floor. Something that looked like a wallet. He bent down and picked up the wallet from the floor.

"A wallet?" muttered me, Kao Yun, and Alex almost simultaneously.

Rashka, on the other hand, looked curious and unfolded the wallet. He was obviously looking for an identity card that would allow him to identify whose wallet it was. The wallet obviously looked quite new. At least it didn't look like it was from the 1900s.

"OH MY GOD?!" Rashka exclaimed loudly as he jumped back and accidentally threw the wallet and the ID card he found so that it fell back on the floor.

"What is it, Rash?" asked Kao Yun as he approached him.

"Do you remember the painting I saw earlier, the one of a young man I said was wearing the *Power Youth* necklace?" Rashka asked, staring at the three if us with a look full of terror and fear.

"Yeah...," the three of us replied simultaneously.

He bent down and picked up the fallen ID card. Then, with a look of utter horror on his face, he pointed to the photo on the ID card with the tip of his index finger.

“Th... This guy... It was this guy...,” he said in a trembling voice.

  The three of us were choked up.

"Are you sure?" asked Kao Yun.

"Sure! Absolutely! His face, and haircut are exactly the same as the one in the painting I saw earlier. I was looking really closely at the painting because I was trying to confirm if what he was wearing was really the *Power Youth* necklace."

The three of us approached Rashka, and observed the identity card he was holding. The name on the card was written as Elliot Landorf, born on December 7, 1995. On the identity card was a piece of written information that it was printed in 2018.

"Are you sure?" asked Kao Yun again, "I mean, maybe this guy just looks like him."

"Uh, I don't know," Rashka replied, "maybe he looked alike. But he looked insanely alike, you know.  And still, isn't it strange that there's one photo and one painting that both contain the faces of people who looked alike, if not the same guy, in a place like this? Besides, if there is a wallet containing the identity card of someone born in 1995, whose card was printed in 2018 left here, then..."

"That means, even if this person is not the same person as the one in the painting, he was once here, in this room. Somehow, he lost his wallet here," I said.

"Give me all the information on the ID card," Erika said swiftly from the other side of the communication device, "so I can track the latest news." I photographed the ID card that Rashka was holding and sent it to Erika through our chatroom.

While Erika tracked down the information we provided, we continued our search. We took the wallet with us, which Rashka put into my bag. Our attention was momentarily distracted when we passed a painting whose frame was much larger than the others we had seen. It depicted an old man, tall and thin, in his fifties, with a bushy, curved moustache, typical of the moustaches of old European men, in the style of the painter Salvador Dali. He was wearing clothes in the style of the 1900s. I observed that the background of the painting was like the lobby of the house we were walking through, complete with painting frames perched on the walls, behind the man.

"Is this the man who owns this house?" I asked.

"Looks like it," Alex said, "I saw this exact painting just before the intersection."

"I think there is also one of these paintings in the lobby of this house," Kao Yun adds. "Why would the owner of this house keep so many paintings of himself in so many places in this house?" asked Rashka. We decided to put those questions aside for the time being and continued our exploration.

Down the narrow hallway, we walked hand in hand. Kao Yun walked in front, Alex right behind him, and then me, and Rashka was the one at the back of the line. Along the way, we passed several other intersections, but still decided to continue walking straight. I was distracted again when we passed another intersection, and again saw the house-owner's self-painting. The exact same painting.

Somehow we felt disturbed Aand uncomfortable with the presence of the painting. But we ignored it and continued our exploration.

Not far after passing the last house-owner's self-portrait, I suddenly felt something strange. Rashka should have been behind me, and therefore I should have heard the sound of his footsteps behind me. The only constant sounds in the hallway were strange sobbing sounds that seemed to be coming from inside the painting perched on the wall. Even so, the sounds were quiet and faint enough, at least in the place where we passed, that I could still hear the sound of our own footsteps.

However, ever since passing by the last house-owner's self-portrait, it felt like I no longer heard the sound of footsteps that should still be behind me.

The sound of Rashka's footsteps is nowhere to be heard!

I instantly looked back, and I swung my flashlight left and right, then straight down a hallway that I didn't know where it ended. I didn't see my friend at all. Not even a trace of him.

Rashka has vanished into thin air!

"Lex! Yun!" I exclaimed frantically, "Rashka's gone!"

My two friends who were walking in front of me immediately turned around. The expressions on their faces looked just as shocked as mine.

"Where's Rashka?" Kao Yun exclaimed worriedly.

"Rash!" we took turns calling out to Rashka. But there was no answer.

"We just passed an intersection," Alex said, "maybe he took a wrong turn?"

"Yeah, no way," I said, "we're walking slowly! I'm only a few steps ahead of him too.

There's no way he didn't see me and took the wrong turn!"

Panicked and worried, we went back down the path we had come, until we arrived back at the intersection, with the house-owner's self-portrait that we had seen last time. Then, as Alex and I looked around in the passageways at the intersection, I saw Kao Yun visibly gasp in shock as he stared at the house-owner's self-portrait, right at the intersection of the maze.

"Guys! Come here!" he called, as he pressed his hand to one of the spots within the house-owner's self-portrait, above one of the paintings in the background.

"Shine flashlight to my hand!" he said. Alex pointed his flashlight where Kao Yun's hand was. "Okay," he said, "I don't want to lead opinions. I'm afraid I'm wrong, then you guys are being suggested by my words. But the background of the house-owner's self-portrait right here is the lobby, right? With his strange paintings perched on the wall."

"The painting I'm pointing my finger to," he said as he placed his index finger on one of the paintings in the background illuminated by Alex's flashlight, "whose painting is this, you think?" We both got closer, and tried to observe the painting Kao Yun was referring to. A painting within a painting. The painting showed a close-up pose of the person being modeled, about shoulder-length. Hence, even though the painting in the background was not very big, we could see the face painted there clearly. A face that was very familiar to us.

Rashka's face.
