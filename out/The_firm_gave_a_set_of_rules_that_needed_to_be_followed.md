Once upon a time, Mary, a worker, had just accepted her dream position at a prestigious law firm. The company was situated in a rural area, encircled by thick forests and undulating hills. Mary was eager to begin her new job, but she had no idea that it would be a nightmare come true.

Mary was given an odd set of guidelines to follow while working at the company on her first day. She had never seen rules like those, so she was surprised. They included things like never leaving her desk after dark, never speaking to anyone in the copy room after 5:00 PM, and never looking directly at any of the senior partners. Although Mary found the rules strange, she decided to abide by them on her first day because she didn't want to upset anyone.

Mary didn't initially observe anything unusual. She worked in the office for the majority of the day, typing up legal paperwork and conducting research for the senior partners. However, strange events started to occur over the course of the weeks. Even though Mary was aware that nobody was supposed to be in the copy room, she would occasionally hear strange noises coming from there after dark. Out of the corner of her eye, she would catch glimpses of people moving down the hallways, but when she turned to look, nobody was there.

Mary followed the rules despite her growing unease, hoping that everything would return to normal eventually. But then, one evening, she made the error of staying past bedtime to complete some work. Mary noticed a strange whisper coming from the copy room as the timer struck 5:00 PM. The whispering grew louder and more insistent despite her attempts to ignore it. The lights in the space flickered briefly before going out.

Only Mary's own breathing provided any company as she was left in complete darkness. She made an effort to approach the door but was unable to see anything. She became aware of footsteps coming from behind her at that point. When she turned around, nobody was there.

Mary frantically searched for her phone and lit the flashlight. She noticed something as the beam of light illuminated the space that made her blood chill. Strange symbols and runes were written all over the walls, and there were unidentifiable objects strewn about the space. 

Mary abruptly became aware of a voice whispering in her ear. It said, "You broke the rules." You must now pay the price.

Mary made an attempt to flee but soon realized she was entrapped. There was no way out because the door was locked from the outside. With whatever was in the copy room, she was all by herself and in the dark.

When the senior partners showed up at the office the following morning, they discovered Mary's lifeless body lying on the floor of the copy room. The strange symbols and objects in the room were enough to give them the chills despite the fact that the cause of death was never discovered. 

The peculiar set of rules Mary had been given on her first day at the company were never mentioned again after that. However, rumors persisted that something evil was waiting to capture anyone who dared to flout the rules in the law firm's hallways. The truth about Mary's fateful night in the copy room is still a mystery to this day.
