A crazed shriek echoed from a distance. Like a horn during an air raid, it moved me into action. I was imbued with a newfound energy. I knew there were things I had to do if I wanted to survive. And I had to take advantage of the sunlight while I had it. For a split second, I questioned if I even wanted to survive. Was it even worth it? I shook the thought away and got moving. 

My priority was to take care of my ankle. I tore strips from a pillowcase and wrapped them around my ankle, holding it in place. One of two T-shaped legs from the ironing board made for a crude but good crutch. 

A trip around the house ensured each window was locked and the curtains were drawn. Turning on the tap over the kitchen sink confirmed the water was still running, at least for now. I took inventory of the food items. I separated the canned food from everything else. What wasn’t canned and previously cooked was ruined by the lack of a working refrigerator and boiling temperatures. The same applied to the raw meats. I had amassed a decent number of cans of Campbell’s Chunky Soup. Julia bought them from the grocery store for nights when she pulled extra hours and couldn’t cook me dinner. Unbeknownst to her, Ada had filled that void. Hence the small stockpile of cans. A few apples, bananas, carrot sticks, a head of lettuce, a handful of bran flakes cereal, half a jar of peanut butter, and two bags of chips rounded out the rest of my reserve. There was still some orange juice, which I consumed quickly. The water was bottled, and I had enough that I could stretch it for a while. If I had to drink straight from the tap, I could. If I don’t go near another person, I won’t turn. I decided the tap would be the last resort.

I spent a great deal of time scrubbing both the kitchen and bathroom floors. The blood had caked onto the tiles, rendering them stubbornly difficult to remove. I emptied my only can of air freshener in the two spaces to stifle the foul odor that lingered. After that, I managed to find two flashlights in the house. I kept one with me and the other on the kitchen counter. 

Not knowing if the water would cut out, I drew myself a bath. Despite the lack of hot water, I welcomed the bath as it countered the heat baking the house. Hitting the water felt like a release my body was begging for after the past twenty-four hours. The water coaxed the trapped tension from my body. I hoped the temperature would at least stifle the swelling of my ankle. I tilted my head back and closed my eyes. The throbbing in my ankle forbade me from fully relaxing.

Sitting in the bath allowed me to finally think about what transpired. Yesterday, I had a wife. I’d like to think I had Ada, also. Now, I had neither. For all I knew, I could be the last sane person in this community. In this city? Country? The thought of that frightened me. If there were indeed other survivors, could we even help each other? How far apart do people have to be to not turn? I was with two people—two opportunities to turn. Why didn’t I become one of those things? The scene of Mason and his wife played over and over in my head like a movie reel. The desperation and sorrow resonated in his voice. But there was more to it. There was something else. There was regret. Regret requires knowledge of a consequence that resulted from an action or inaction, whether intentional or not. What did Mason do or not do to feel this regret? What did he know? The scene ran through my mind again. He mentioned the water. Was that the key? He worked with Julia at the purification plant. Was something in the water? I drank the water in some form regularly up until about two months ago. Then, I consumed only bottled water. It wasn’t cheap around here, but we could afford it. Julia insisted on herself drinking the local water. It was the product of her team’s hard work. Did I not turn because I didn’t drink the water? How much, if any, did Julia know about this?

The more I pondered, the more questions I had. I quickly lost track of the time, prompting me to drain the water from the bath. The last thing I needed was one of those things busting into my house while I was in here. And the thought of me soaking in this water didn’t help to convince me to stay.

It seemed like the minute I stepped out of the bathroom, my skin was pebbled with sweat. My oversized t-shirt clung tightly to my body. No open windows in this weather rendered the house a hot, stale oven. Now, I was without ice or an electric fan, but that was the least of my worries. 

That night, I finished some leftover pasta in a half-empty Tupperware container. My stomach did not call for it, but I had to pack in as much energy as possible. I double-checked the coffee mug on top of the fridge and headed to the living room. Laid out before me on the coffee table was my flashlight, a large kitchen knife, and a section of an old pipe I found under the kitchen sink. A slight sparkle of light flickered from a nearby candle Julia kept in the house for power outages. I sank into the couch and tried to sleep as much as my ankle would allow. Staying in the living room allowed me to hear the coffee mug if it was knocked off the fridge. If an intruder entered my house, I wanted to react as quickly as possible. But I honestly didn’t know what that reaction would be, and I hoped I didn’t have to find out.

My new diet in the immediate days following consisted of fruit, vegetables, cereal, and chips. When that had run out, it was one can of soup per day. I divided the soup into three portions—breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The soup was devoured quickly each time. When your body is deprived of the nourishment it needs, your brain does not rebel against food at an undesirable temperature. I sipped on the water conservatively throughout the day and saved a swallow for the night to rinse my teeth after brushing. 

To fill my days, I dove into the books I gathered through the book exchange program Ada managed for our community. She funneled me all the good ones and didn’t mind that I provided nothing in return. I tore through them voraciously. Never in my life had I read that quickly. Dialogue did not exist here anymore, so I was craving to hear people speak, even in text. I was utterly engrossed in the stories that whisked me from my woeful existence. I didn’t want to leave the New York reigned over by Don Corleone or the cell in the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane that housed Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Anywhere was better than here.

In the afternoons, I squeezed in daily workouts to keep myself active and my muscles engaged. I was mindful of my injured ankle and did what I could despite it—pushups on one foot, squats with the help of my crutch, and stomach crunches. With my extreme daily caloric deficit, I was spent after each workout. The weight flew off me. Thick layers of fat thinned to accentuate the definition of my muscles underneath. I was reminded of my twenties when fitness was a priority in my life. I knew this was the best I would look before my worst. This was the peak of the roller coaster before it all went screaming downhill.

I don’t recall when I lost track of the days. Perhaps it was after I finished my last book. The very exercise of tracking the days gone by kept me anchored to my old life and to sanity itself. Knowing how many days it had been since *that* dayallowed me to clearly define when life was good. Drawing on the good times from my memory bank was like drawing water from a well in the middle of the Sahara. To relive them was to experience some semblance of solace. But at some point, my mind succumbed to the devastating monotony and resigned. Every waking minute was so routine there was nothing unique that set one day apart from the next. Staring up at the ceiling with insomniac eyes, all the days felt like one eternal day. The concept of time had diminished down to the lighting of a candle when it got dark and snuffing it out when it got bright. My world was now like a barren desert land. The peaceful quiet was a disguise for the unmerciful death that would eventually find you. Occasionally, one of those things would scurry by outside like a viper traversing the sandy void. A reminder of the killer roaming the land. Its tracks were soon covered up by displaced sand in the passing wind as if it was never there at all.

One day, I decided to try a new activity to break the monotony. I unfolded a stiff chessboard and set up its pieces. Moving a white pawn to e4, I initiated the match. I spun the board so the black pieces faced me and responded with a pawn to e5. The chessboard spun twice more as dueling knights made their moves. More spinning. Two opposing bishops slashed diagonally mid-board. More spinning. A white knight pushed forward, leaving an open line to its queen that was immediately taken by a black bishop. Yet, some more spinning. The white bishop positioned mid-board slashed across again, this time one space from the black king at f7. Two more spins of the board. The black king moved forward to e7. This was countered by the other white knight to d5. Two white knights were now stationed beside one another. Checkmate. 

Through muscle memory, I had completed the famous Légal Trap—a trap that necessitated the sacrifice of the white queen to be victorious. I harkened back to the times I used this gambit on Julia during our matches. Her eyes would light up with glee when she took my queen. The light was soon snuffed out when she realized her king was trapped with no escape. I relished beating her in chess because she was much stronger than me intellectually. We never spoke about it. It was just something we knew and accepted. But I always had her in chess. In a multitude of scenarios, I was able to spring the trap on her. But what was I doing here at this moment? I was merely playing by myself. How can I possibly label anything a victory now when I played into my own hand? It was not a trap. It was just a series of moves I knew to make because I knew what was coming. There was no separate opposing consciousness that challenged me. No one reciprocated playful trash talk. No one so annoyed with consecutive losses but still demanded another match, knowing they’d lose again. I was alone in every sense of the word.

A guttural yell escaped from the depths of my soul. There were no words. It was just an audible explosion of suppressed emotions. A flick of the hands upward and the chessboard flipped multiple times. The finely crafted pieces flew in every which way, all over my living room. My chest heaved. But then, it quickly stopped from a sudden realization. It was the first time in countless days I had vocalized any sort of noise. The very sound of my voice surprised me. It was steeped in anger and frustration, yes, but it was alive. There was life. It was then that I made up my mind to leave this place.

Connecting our little community to the central village was a long, winding road. We had made the thirty-minute drive when we first arrived here. Julia made multiple trips as required by her work. Never having the desire to see the village, there wasn’t ever a point for me to join her. That trek was now my passage to salvation. At least, that is what I hoped and idealized. I imagined a group of medical personnel—unaffected by our contaminated water—whisking me away and fixing me back up.

I opened my suitcase and loaded it with every can of soup I had. Roughly three-quarters of my bottled water made it into the suitcase as I had to make room for other essentials. I threw in some clothes, a flashlight, the kitchen knife, and the can opener. It all made for heavy luggage, but I needed everything. The sight of the suitcase made me mourn what I had and valued. This was now my life, reduced to a 60-liter Samsonite. 

Carefully, I moved the curtain of the window by the front door just enough to peer outside. The coast was clear. What I couldn’t see was where I needed to go—roughly fifteen feet to the right of the front door, where our car was parked. Because Julia was one of the senior and vital scientists working at the purification plant, she was assigned a Toyota RAV4 for her trips to the village. It was stationed in the carport at the side of the house opposite Ada’s. With one last gander out the window, it was time to move.

I unlatched the deadbolt and opened the front door. The fresh air greeted me like a flaming blanket, but it wasn’t any worse than what was inside. I dragged the suitcase across the threshold and quickly locked the door. If things went sideways, I would need to return. 

My focus was getting to the car, but I could not ignore the scene around me. It was crystalized chaos. Each piece of the grand destruction was frozen in violence and anarchy. And it was as silent as the remains of a warzone. I moved quickly.

Every prick of my crutch against the uneven pavement made a noise—*puck, puck, puck—*that reverberated down the quiet street. My anxiety rose to near-crippling levels. I pictured one of those things coming around the corner, called by the sound. The almost rhythmic hum of the suitcase wheels rolling on the cement only encouraged me to move faster. As I neared the car, I hit the button on the key remote and heard a muffled click. To be expedient, I disregarded the trunk. I opened the rear driver-side door, lifted the suitcase onto its side, and pushed it onto the rear seats. Then I jumped into the driver’s seat and set my crutch beside me. The engine rumbled to life as I turned the key. Its sound was magnified in the silence. I threw the car into drive. My left foot depressed the accelerator.

The car had a herky-jerky start as I got acquainted with left-foot driving. It eventually smoothed to a passable drive. 

*I’m doing the right thing*, I told myself. Getting out of town and going into the village was the right course of action. What was I going to do in my house after the food and water had run dry? Wither and die? That was no plan. This felt right. Taking my chances at finding hope and civilization again was the right plan. Immediately after that, I wondered if I was only lying to myself. Was my recurring assumption that the whole world had gone to hell a correct one?

As I neared the through road, I looked at the destruction in my rear-view mirror. The sun was on its descent, which only made the scene more ominous. I was relieved that I was leaving it all behind. The houses that flanked both sides of me soon transitioned to large, imposing trees—signaling the mouth of the road. A huge breath of relief escaped me as the car cruised along.

I heard the sound before I felt it. It was a sharp, high-pitched whine. Then, my face stung from the shards of exploding glass. I heard it again. A softball-sized hole appeared in my windshield beside the one before it. More glass cut into my face. Instinctively, I spun the wheel to the left, taking the RAV4 straight into the base of a tree. My chest crashed into the steering wheel, knocking the wind out of me. I heard the noise again, this time behind me. The rear passenger side window shattered. Glass punched the side of my face as I wheezed. I threw the car into reverse and stomped on the accelerator. The car pulled swiftly backwards. My left foot awkwardly pressed on the brake, and I slammed into my seat. I steered left again before hearing one of the rear tires explode like a grenade going off. I was practically standing on the accelerator. The car swiveled left and right. I gripped the wheel tight to keep it straight. The car shot forward in the direction in which I came. There was one more loud thump behind me. I felt the ground beneath the tires vibrate. My destroyed community rapidly appeared before me once again.

The unforgiving screech of steel on the pavement echoed loudly as I drove back into town. It felt as though I was driving with a fire alarm bell strapped to my car, announcing my return. The rear sagged and hopped intermittently. I knew there was only one place to retreat to. I hightailed it home.

Who the hell was shooting at me? And why? That was my only way out of here. Now, it was no longer a possibility without getting killed. The sensation of glass hitting my face lingered. I was flinching so much I didn’t see it in the evening dusk. I was about a block away from my house when the silhouette of a person ran in front of the car. My remaining headlight caught just enough for me to see it was a man. He put up his hands as I slammed on the brake. It was too late. The car skidded and hopped on a narrow sidewalk. The airbag deployed in front of me and nearly knocked me out cold. All I could see were flashes of white clouds. I blinked slowly, trying to clear the blur in my eyes. I stared at my hands until they came into focus. The sounds around me returned like someone had turned the volume dial from low to high. Then I heard the wailing. The man squealed like a warthog being disemboweled by lions. His fists pummeled my hood in anguish.

“Back up! Back up!” he yelled.

I pushed down on the deployed airbag enough to see over it. I had driven straight into the front of a house, pinning the man against it with my car. His legs were crushed. The tiny ray of light from my car deflected upwards, showing the awfulness before me. 

The man kept banging on my hood until each fist looked more lethargic than the last. Then, they were more like taps. The man looked drunk with pain. His head and torso dropped onto the hood. My hand reached for the shifter to reverse the car, but I stopped myself. I knew what was about to happen. The man’s head snapped up. His hands shot forward at me. In the dark, his eyes looked like they were glowing red orbs. That terrible scream escaped his lips. 

I was thrown for such a loop that it took me a few beats to realize his screams were not echoing. There was another voice delivering its wretched scream. I turned my head and looked out the passenger window. Down the block—from the same direction I had come—was another one of those things. And to my horror, he sprinted towards us. 

In the tight quarters, I frantically battered the airbag with both hands. It deflated enough for me to shift my torso. I pulled the door handle and tried to exit the car but could not. In my panic, I forgot I was still in the grip of the seat belt. Through the passenger window, I saw the thing continue to barrel towards me. I looked the other way and saw my house. It was not that far, but could I make it, especially with my ankle? I told myself I had to try. The seat belt slithered away with a click. With my left foot firmly planted on the pavement, I stood out of the car. I reached back in for my crutch when I saw the thing just mere steps from the car. There was no way I’d make it now. 

I dove back into the car and slammed the door. The thing jumped onto the hood of my car, leaving dents. He crouched down and glared at me with his flaming eyes. He let off another shriek and darted his head into the cockpit. I moved left just in time to dodge his bite. The loud clamp of his teeth rang in my right ear. The airbag was now flaccid. Spittle ejected from his mouth and dribbled down my neck. He darted in again, this time with both his hands. His fingernails burrowed into the right side of my face. The small shards of glass dug deeper into my cheek. He dragged his fingernails downward along my neck. I screamed in agony. 

The thing trapped between the house and my car let out a howl. He yanked at the second thing’s legs. The second thing fell flat against the hood with his head dangling in the cockpit. My instincts took over from there. I reached over and grabbed the passenger seat belt. Quickly, I drew for more slack like it was my literal lifeline. I wrapped the shoulder strap once around the second thing’s neck and buckled it. I pulled the belt taut. The second thing had a dreadful look of surprise before snapping his teeth defiantly at me. He narrowly missed. Even within the constraints of the seat belt, his powerful strength granted him some range in movement. It was a matter of time before he pulled the latch clean from the buckle. I escaped from the car, forgoing my crutch. 

I didn’t need to look back to know what was happening. Those things sounded like two feral cats with their tails tied in a knot and slung over an electrical wire. I just ran. I ran as fast as my pain tolerance would take me. Whatever healing may have happened to my ankle in the passing days was undone in seconds. I just focused on my house to numb the pain. *Just get there*, I said to myself. I kept my eyes on it through the darkness. It got bigger and bigger with each excruciating step. An overwhelming sense of relief washed over me as I hit the front door. I fished the small bundle of keys from my pocket and fumbled it. With only the aid of the dim moonlight, I struggled to find them. I swiped both hands across the ground like I was cleaning the area. I scolded myself. How could I have screwed up so badly after having made it back home? Some breathless seconds passed that felt like forever. I heard the furious battle on the hood of my car wage on. Finally, I felt the metal against my hands and scooped it up. My fingers groped each key until I felt the one with the triangular bow. With one hand on the lock for guidance, the other inserted the key and turned. I cranked the door handle and tumbled into the house.

Sleep was impossible that night. I had never come so close to death. The very thought of that was like a drug that stapled my eyelids back and kept the lights on in my brain. To make things worse, the throbbing pain in my ankle returned with a vengeance. The cuts on my face burned. 

At the first sign of light over the horizon, I was up on my feet. With the help of the remaining ironing board leg, I stepped to the window beside the front door and peered out. There was nothing outside my door. Still, I cautiously cracked the door open. I had to position most of my body outside of my house to see down the street. With one hand still clinging to the doorknob, I craned my neck for a better view. The RAV4 still pinned a set of legs against the house, but the torso was gone. So, too, was the second thing I tied to the seat belt. The green car was now a healthy shade of crimson in the front. I could see the rear driver-side door agape, providing a good view of the empty backseat. My suitcase was gone.

I hobbled over to the kitchen and saw the yellow flashlight standing vertically on the counter. I must have forgotten about it in my hastiness to leave. Resting on the kitchen table was the bottled water I could not stuff into my suitcase. I considered my dumb luck.

I was downing some water when I heard a splash in the pool. I moved to the window beside the refrigerator barricading the back door. To reassure myself, I glanced at the coffee mug still balanced on top of the fridge. Through the window, I could see my patio dining set and pool chairs were now either moved or tipped over, giving way to a view of the undulating water. Someone or something must have ventured through my backyard during my attempted escape. On the far side of the pool was a dark object floating in the water. It looked to be contained in a translucent bag. 

A load of questions ran through my head, paramount among them—what in the world is that thing? It certainly wasn’t mine. I considered it to be a trap—a lure of some kind to get me outside. But who would do that and why? There was nothing to gain in taking me or my house. There were blocks of houses just like mine. My curiosity got the better of me. I decided to retrieve it. Or perhaps I came to grips with having no plan yet again, and I saw this object as a possible catalyst to change that.

I removed the coffee mug and dragged the fridge away from the back door. I hadn’t eaten anything substantial in days, so I didn’t have to move the fridge far to slip through the door. I surveyed the area on the other side. It was clear. Reaching the pool was quick as my backyard was not sprawling. Quietly lowering my crutch, I picked up the skimmer net from the concrete. A few twists extended the handle to the max. I dropped the net into the pool, guided it over to the object, and scooped it up. There was a noticeable weight to such a tiny object. Drawing the net back to me, I gripped the translucent bag and scurried back into the house with my crutch. The fridge and coffee mug returned to their positions. 

Looking at the wet bag in my hands, I realized it was a Ziploc pouch. I peeled the seal apart and pulled out the object within. It was a blue rubber ball the size of a large orange. I rotated the ball in my hand, looking for anything unusual, but it was just a plain ball. Confused, I placed the ball on my table with the Ziploc and heard the crunch of paper. The seemingly innocuous sound stopped me cold. I raised the bag to eye level and saw a folded piece of paper inside. I unfolded and flattened it against the table. Scribbled in the middle of the paper read the following:

*You alive in there?*

*If so, toss it back to me.*

*We can help each other.*

*Your neighbor from across the alley.*

*—Roy*

My heart was thumping so hard it sounded like a percussion drumline. I read the note five times in a row. My brain grappled with it each time. Isolation had consumed my existence, and yet, here I was, holding a piece of communication from an actual human being. On top of that, it was from the man I referred to as Willy. The same man who had never projected anything less than disdain towards me at each encounter. A complete practical stranger. He now alluded to us helping each other. I was immediately skeptical. How could I possibly trust him? Heck, how could I trust anybody when law and order was dead? And did I even want to help him? 

It didn’t take much thought to soften my stance on the latter question. I had no food, one foot, a plummeting body mass index, and a mind inching towards insanity. Help suddenly didn’t sound so bad. Perhaps Roy was in the same boat. Maybe whatever he felt about me was thrown out the window when he, too, was losing it all. It couldn’t get much lower for me and probably for him as well. I decided to respond. 

On the back of the same piece of paper, I wrote:

*I’m alive but injured.*

*No food and little water.*

*How can we help each other?*

*—Don*

Standing in my backyard—no more than three feet from the back door—I launched the Ziploc pouch containing the ball and note towards Roy’s property. It arched in the air over the alleyway and landed short of Roy’s pool. The ball within the pouch bounced a few times before coming to rest. I kicked myself for the unimpressive throw. To retrieve the pouch, Roy would have to walk beyond his pool and almost to the alleyway. Not a good first step in building his trust. 

I barricaded the back door again and left the kitchen. My back was glued to the front door. Still not knowing what was considered a safe distance, I wasn’t taking any chances. A while later, I heard splashes in quick succession. I went into the kitchen and looked out the window. Floating in the pool was a black fanny pack and four soup cans. Roy was not in sight, so I moved quickly back down and out to the pool. I retrieved the fanny pack and cans with the skimmer net.

I dropped the soaking fanny pack and soup cans onto my living room coffee table and stared at them. My paranoia visited me again. Was all this a part of a sinister plan? Coincidentally, the soup cans were of the same variety Julia had bought for me. I was unsure of what to do. Suddenly, a sound from the fanny pack tore through the silence. I jumped like a bomb had gone off. My crutch rattled off the floor. The sound resembled that of interference when an antenna TV picked up a poor signal. The noise continued until I heard what sounded like muffled speech. I zipped open the fanny pack, and there—within a plastic bag—sat a Motorola two-way radio. I picked it up and inspected it. It was battery powered. Underneath the radio was a small rectangular metal box. It was dented, and its color had begun to fade. Plastered across the top was a sticker that read BATTLESHIP.
