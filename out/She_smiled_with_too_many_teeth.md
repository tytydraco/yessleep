While writing this, my fists won’t stop hurting I can’t tell if it’s the grip or the fear or the way I know she’s behind me. I don’t want to look. I already know what I’ll see...


I didn’t notice it at first. Honestly, I thought I was just tired too many late nights, too much coffee, and too many hours staring at screens. But then she showed up. At the train station. Just standing there on the opposite platform like she’d been waiting for me. Normal clothes. Normal face. Except when she smiled. There was something off not dramatic, not obvious  just this... stretch. Like her mouth opened a little too wide. Like it wanted to keep going. The worst part is, no one even noticed. That's why I started to think that I was just tired.


But after that incident something happened that changed me.. 

After showering I looked myself in the mirror, the smile was there again.. behind me.. I looked back, 𝑛𝑜 𝑜𝑛𝑒 was there. 

After the mirror, I stopped trusting reflections. 

It’s not like I stopped using them completely you kind of can’t. But I found ways to avoid really 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔. Brushed my teeth while staring at the sink. Got dressed using shadows. Put lipstick with half eyes closed.

I didn’t talk to anyone about it. Not even Ethan, my roommate, and we’ve lived together since college. He wouldn’t get it. No one would. 

And for a while… I managed. A week, maybe. She didn’t show up. Not in windows, not in crowds. I thought maybe that was it. A sleep-deprived hallucination, a weird subconscious loop. Brains do that, right? You see one odd thing, your mind keeps reusing it. Dreams get in the way of real life. I Googled it. Made sense. 

Then one night I caught her in a Zoom call. 

We had this late client meeting, everyone tired and quiet. I wasn’t even speaking  just watching the tiles shift around. Then for half a second, the screen glitched. It froze, just a flicker, like a connection stutter. 

And there she was. In my square. Right behind me, over my shoulder.. Just barely there. Blurry, like motion blur. But I recognized the hair. And the shape of her smile. 

I turned around in my chair so fast I knocked over my coffee. Nothing was there. No shadow, no noise. Just my jacket on the back of the door. 

But when I looked back at the screen, three coworkers had gone quiet. 

“Hey,” one of them said. “Who was that just now? Behind you.” 

I just ended the call. 

I didn’t sleep the night after the Zoom call. 

Every time I closed my eyes, I could feel her behind me. Not hear 𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑙. Like warmth that didn’t belong. Like breath on the wrong part of your neck. 

The next morning, I checked the video recording. We always save client calls, just in case. I scrubbed through it frame by frame, holding my breath. 

Nothing. 

No glitch. No figure. Not even the coffee spill. 

I started crying, not from fear. From 𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑏𝑡, I could handle a ghost, honestly. Even a stalker, somehow. But this? Not knowing whether my brain was betraying me? That scared me more than anything. 

I made an appointment with a neurologist. Booked a psych consult. Started journaling. No mirrors, no reflections, no photos. Just words. "𝑆ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑 𝑎𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝑡𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑦." "𝑁𝑜 𝑜𝑛𝑒 𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒 𝑠𝑎𝑤 ℎ𝑒𝑟." "𝑀𝑎𝑦𝑏𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑚𝑒 𝑢𝑛𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔" 

The night before my appointment, I found something under my pillow. 

A tooth. 

Perfectly clean. Not bloody, not broken. Just… placed. Like someone had tucked it there, gently. 

I haven’t lost any teeth. Not mine. 

I didn’t scream. I didn’t cry. I just sat on the edge of the bed holding it, cold in my palm, and thought: 𝑊ℎ𝑎𝑡  𝑖𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑛𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟 𝑔𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑡𝑜 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑝? 

So I did something drastic. 

I booked a room in a hotel with no mirrors. I packed only what I needed. I left my phone. I left a note for Ethan,  just a “taking time away” kind of thing. Nothing dramatic. I don’t want people thinking I’m a threat to myself. 

I’m not. 

But here’s the thing: I’ve started pulling my own teeth. 

Not all of them. Not at once. Just one, every few days. Cleanly. Carefully. It's not hard if you ice your gums and know what you’re doing. 

Because I think that’s what she wants. 

She keeps smiling at me, even now, and 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑒 𝑖𝑠 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑡𝑜 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒..
