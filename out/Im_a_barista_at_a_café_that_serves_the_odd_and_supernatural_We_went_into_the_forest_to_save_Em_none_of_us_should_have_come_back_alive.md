I work at The Drowsy Spectre, a café positioned in a place that shouldn't get any business. No human business, that is. But the store was closed and for the first time, we went to them instead. Into the forest, where nearly all the odd and supernatural customers come from. Usually a lot of weird stuff happens, but weird has given way to violence. What I have to say won't weigh much on you if you're new, so if you are, check[ this](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/z473tt/i_am_a_barista_that_serves_the_supernatural_find/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) out.

\--------------------------------------

First off, my leg is messed up pretty bad. I have crutches to get around seeing as I can't put *any* pressure on my destroyed foot. Honestly, the doctors were not sure if it would heal right. Fortunately I have Selene and she thinks she can rebuild it. But... it'll hurt. That is worth having my foot back, though. It is a waiting game now. Once the healing process is well-underway, she will do whatever it is she does.

But I know that isn't what you're here for. You want to know what happened in the woods, if I found Tom, if I saved Em. I'm going to start a little before the beginning, when we all met at the shop to expand the protection the necklace provides. Usually it protects one person for between three to five minutes, just long enough for a quick trash run. Richard has a box of some sort, one that he can activate if the store needs to be closed for any reason. Now I don't know what exactly the point of The Drowsy Spectre is, but it *needs* to run. Like Selene said in the last update; two humans, one forest sprite, and one who has seen the great beyond. For some reason, that stops the plague of the supernatural from spreading (that is what I have pieced together).

So the box, when it runs, mimics that same thing. There are all sorts of markings on it that Selene won't translate, though I believe she knows their meaning. Shapes lined atop each other, lines dashing through like strange hieroglyphics. I don't know how long it can run with the shop closed, but Selene turned it off anyway. She opened the box and it stopped glowing. Inside was a brilliant blue gem, large enough to fill my palm. It was warm, which I hadn't expected seeing how cold it has been lately. This was Christmas night, mind you. What a way to spend the holiday.

When I held the gem and the necklace, the necklace glowed. "So long as you have both on your person, it should work." Selene explained. "But I have no idea how long. If it starts to dim, you need to come back."

"But if we haven't-"

"I don't care if you haven't succeeded. It won't do me any good to have Em dead *and* almost all of the staff too." She took a deep breath. "Look, just don't die. You have a good heart and there are those that would eat it out there. Don't get killed, New Guy."

"I think it is time for a new name." Barrow stated. "He's not New Guy material anymore."

"I suppose not." Selene thought on this, then smiled. "Hero it is, then."

I couldn't help but smile too. "I like it."

We packed necessities, but only enough for a night. That was another rule, one that Selene imposed on us so greatly that I was second guessing my heroic plan. "Don't stay out after sunrise. You need to be able to see the café before the sun touches it."

"Or what?"

"I can't say. I just... can't. Don't let it happen."

Vague, but vague was often more frightening. "We won't."

She bid us farewell. Barrow, John, and I. We left her with Em, who slept still as a corpse on a cot in her office. The store would have no protection, none at all, and she would have to stay there and keep Em safe. Keep the building safe. No rules to protect her, no magic box maintaining peace throughout the café. This entire plan was a risk even for her, but I saw what she could do. She's been through worse, I am sure.

The forest was far too dark to see in even though the sun had yet to set fully. I was wearing a decent jacket, but my face was still exposed. The chill that snaked through the trees froze my nose instantly. John lifted his shirt over his nose in a makeshift mask, but Barrow marched on without notice. The fire still burned in the distance, the only light against an overcast sky. It was so bright that it casted orange hues upon low-set clouds, a spotlight for our trio to follow. It was silent, which I hadn't expected. Despite the necklace, I assumed all manner of wicked things would be creeping up on us, just out of our flashlight's beams, waiting for the necklace to fail so that they might strike.

The necklace had a good range since it was boosted, probably the size of the café, so either beings were there in the darkness and biding their time, or we walked alone. I am not sure which of those is better. Somehow, being completely alone in such a haunted place is more chilling than not.

"There." John whispered, his flashlight catching something far ahead. "Something big. It's gone."

I couldn't see anything, but I was certain who watched from a distance. I knew a giant, we all did. But the necklace would protect us, otherwise Tall Ben or something else would have snatched us. We pushed on, forced to cross the path that John saw the giant make. He wasn't there, of course. The protection spell drove him off. Not too far, I'm certain. An overwhelming sense of being watched drove all of my hairs up. Not just my neck, but my entire body. It was more than just being cold, my very bones felt like they were beginning to freeze from the threatening gaze of predators.

I could no longer stand the silence. "Is DeGuire out here?"

John didn't answer right away. "Probably. I don't know."

"Can I ask why he bought a candle?" I was certain that was a sensitive question, but curiosity and the need for sound in the silence forced it out. "What did Amber tell him?"

"He's married." John answered his flashlight dancing through the trees, as if he thought his brother would come upon them. "Or was? Her name is Payton. She was very sick and he wanted to trade his life for her's. Trade the sickness."

"And that worked?"

"She's still alive. But... but she has forgotten all of us."

That was awful. "So he saved her life and she just ran off? No thanks? Nothing at all?"

"Not like that." Barrow answered. "The café stands on a rift of some kind. This forest is a plane between two worlds, an endless place between the finite. The café is in both the plane and the world you know. So, when we stay too long in The Drowsy Spectre, the world might forget us."

Was I forgotten? Thank god I write these updates. "She didn't know who he was, but he made the sacrifice anyway?"

John was quiet. "Yeah."

"But he is still alive, though. He didn't die from a sickness."

When John answered, his eyes wouldn't meet mine. "I don't know, I've never seen anyone but him light a candle. Who knows how they work."

"Do you have other siblings?"

"None that remember me."

The conversation was growing all too depressing and it didn't seem fair to dig up John's trauma, especially in such a dangerous and terrifying place. I just don't know the guy at all, though. Barrow, however, I had known for about a month now and I still knew very little of him. "At the risk of sounding rude; what are you, Barrow?" He didn't answer. "Selene said the shop needed two humans, a forest sprite, and one that has seen beyond. That has to be you, right?"

"I'm dead." He confessed plainly. "That is the short of it. I'm not alive, not like you and John."

"That's why you can't feel?"

"No." Barrow shook his head. "I wish it were."

More mystery. "But you've seen what happens after?"

We kept moving and I waited. He delivered. "I have."

"And?"

"It sounds like a cop-out, but it can't be put into words. A great presence, an eye that saw all of eternity." He was cut off by the crunching of leaves. Something was out there, which was no surprise.

But the voice was. "I forgive you, John." A female voice said. "Your brother forgives you. Come see him. It can be like it was, like brothers again."

"Who is that?" John asked.

"That's a pretty bad lure if you don't even recognize them."

John laughed nervously. "Y-yeah."

"Hey guys." Another voice whispered from up ahead. "You're getting close. Look, it is dangerous. Toss that necklace to me and I'll get Tom for you."

"Not gonna work, Ben."

The giant sighed. "Come on, man. You know how fast I am! I'll be fine!"

"I'm not worried about you."

My flashlight caught him. He towered into the trees, as tall as the pines that climbed high above. "You should be." He sneered, seeing his plot foiled. "I'm just trying to help." Then he sped away into the dark, dodging the trees with such grace, not making a single sound as his feet landed on dry leaves.

Tall Ben wasn't wrong, though. We were getting close. I could see the fire billowing through the trees, engulfing a building. It would do no good if Tom was dead when we found him. Can't question a dead person. Well... I guess I just did, but Barrow was a unique case. "Hey, is that why your name is Barrow?"

Barrow glanced at me. "What?"

"Because you died. You know, Barrow."

"No, that is just my name."

Huh. Odd coincidence. As we got closer, I was able to see that there was more than one building in the clearing. It looked like a school of some sort. Maybe an old church? I am not sure. We came to the tree line and weighed our options, trying to come up with a plan. If we went in, would that force Tom to leave? Or did entering buildings just extend the protection to the building? That wouldn't be good because we *needed* Tom.

"Well then one of us has to stay outside." Barrow stated. "They will be safe. Since we will be in a building, we won't have to worry about Tall Ben. We're all smart enough not to fall for his tricks."

"But there is more than Tall Ben out there. Who knows what is inside, living with Tom. Who knows what Tom can do. What if he takes a picture of us?"

"He has, plenty of times. It has never had any effect on any males."

"I'll stay outside."

I looked at John and saw Tall Ben on the opposite tree line, giving me a thumbs up as if he were part of the team. "Are you sure?"

"I'm not risking anything. If you think about it, I am getting the best deal. I'll be safe with the necklace."

That was true. "Then you stay. Barrow and I will go in and find Tom."

It was decided. The main building was long and 'L' shaped, we approached the end of the shorter end which were the main doors. A sign over the door titled it 'Fourth Society of the Empty Eye.' So it was a cult of some kind, I guess. The handle turned and the door opened freely, squeeking to announce our arrival.

I handed the necklace and gem to John, which lit up his jacket with blue light. "If something goes wrong, call for us."

"I should be saying that to you." John placed the jewelry around his neck. "Hey, we haven't spoken much. I've been... quiet ever since my brother got taken. You're a good guy, I think. When we get back, we should talk more."

"Yeah." I nodded. "Humans got to stick together, right?" I nudged Barrow, who shrugged at the joke. "Come on, you saying you can't even laugh?"

"No, I can." He slipped through the door. John's eyes were on Tall Ben, who stood clearly in the treeline, lit by the fire that burned a storage building. "I work in the kitchen so I don't see much of him. Haven't even heard him speak until today. God, he is tall" .

I gave him one last reassuring nod before I followed after Barrow. No more protection, down one man. I keep calling this journey a plan, but we were all playing it step by step. There were plenty of windows lining both sides of the entry hall, which was incredibly short. I am average height, about five-eight, and my head nearly brushed the ceiling. It opened up as we went on, but not by much. Whoever built the structure must have been rushed or had a tiny budget to make it so short.

A kid ran past me. They were so fast that I barely noticed them. Silent footsteps carried them into a room on our right, then two more kids dashed after them with playful laughter. I glanced at Barrow, who looked equally as perplexed.

"Oh, don't mind them."

A woman stood in one of the open rooms on our left. It looked like an apartment of some kind, with an old couch and a wall-mounted tv. I could see the edge of a counter as well, possibly a kitchen. She wore a loose nightdress, one that our flashlights pierced through. She leaned on the doorframe and crossed her arms.

It was the damn spider woman again.

"No." I answered her before she asked.

She opened her mouth and smiled, her face a bit red. "I didn't even ask anything." Her spider eyes were gone, as were her spindly legs. If I am honest, she was striking. I couldn't look away from her face. "I'm better now. I was... cursed, I think. But look at me? Normal. Back to normal."

"Want me to bite her?" Came a whisper from my jacket, one so low that only I could hear. I shook my head gently, wishing to keep Silence's presence secret. Yeah, I brought the snake. She insisted she go.

"You do look better." That caused her to blush, but Barrow slapped my arm. "What? She does. She isn't spidery anymore."

Something crashed in her room, followed by joyous laughter. "Quiet down, kids!" She shook her head, a playful grin on her face. "Past dinner time for them. I swear, I can't keep all these little ones on any schedule." She had something in her arms. "This doesn't even put them to sleep anymore."

Was that a lute? I don't really know.

"Come on, Axel." Barrow took a step away from the woman. "We're wasting time."

"Oh? What are you guys looking for? Maybe I can help."

"Someone. How can you help us?"

"The entire place has cameras. I've got lots of eyes, watching everything. I can pull them up on my computer, if you want."

"Axel." Barrow warned.

I looked at him, ever the idiot. "What? Tom might be on one of them."

"Oh, Tom. The camera creep. Is that who you are looking for?"

"Do you know where he is?" This entire quest just got a lot easier.

She nodded, her smile so warm. "He has a few hiding spots! Please, I am so bored here, let me help you!" The woman disappeared into her room and, without thinking, I stepped inside after her. Barrow was quick on my heels and tried to grab me before I went in, but I was already through the doorway. He shut the door immediately behind me as I went inside. I was focused on her, so I let him guard the door.

And I didn't die. As promised, she was at her computer typing away. "How do the cameras still work? The lights don't." Then again, her computer was on so there was power of some kind. "Is there power?"

"Not that kind." She murmured, typing away. Then I noticed that the computer *wasn't* on. The screen was black, but she was hitting the keys with a fury. I came closer to see what she was up to and only then noticed the webs. Thick silk ran from under the keyboard and up the wall, dancing into the corners and out the many holes within the room. Each key shook a different strand, all playing notes like the softest of pianos.

"My children will be back soon, they will have an answer for us." She turned in her chair. I've been so lonely all my life and being near her just... filled that void, I guess. Her face reddened more when I couldn't break from her eyes. "Maybe I can play you a song while we wait?" The lute was in her lap. "I haven't had company in ages!"

I heard distant, muted banging. Someone's voice. But I really didn't want to offend the woman, she was so kind to me already. "Sure, why not? Tom can wait a moment."

She invited me to sit on the couch, so I turned to Barrow and gestured for him to follow. He wasn't there. Incredibly rude, considering what this woman was doing for us. "My friend can be insensitive at times, sorry."

"No trouble. It can just be you and me."

I liked that. "I feel so awful that I haven't asked for your name?"

"Ramata. But you can call me Jo."

"Jo." It sounded nice. "Well, Jo, what will you play?"

She leaned one leg up to get comfortable. Too comfortable, considering how sheer her nightgown was. Then she plucked the strings. I cannot remember what tune she played, nor even what the notes sounded like. All I know is that it was beautiful. Not in a false way, like I only imagined it being good. No, it was truly a tune that would lull any man into a blissful sleep. The lullaby had my eyes heavy, so much so that I closed them in her presence. I was so warm inside, so comfortable, like a first date with a friend you've been waiting on for so long. Only, I just met her. She was so kind as to hold me close in an embrace, like a mother rocking to sleep an exhausted child. So great were the troubles of recent weeks that I let myself fall into that embrace, fall so deeply into sleep that perhaps, for once, I might feel rested.

A thump woke me, the music stopped.

I was staring at the ground, suspended in the air by something warm and soft. I couldn't move anything but my neck, upper shoulder, and feet. I was wrapped so tightly that even breathing was a chore, but I got by with the air I caught. The spider woman from the shop crawled down from the ceiling, which was *much* higher than the halls outside, and stared at the door. Her lute was on the ground, as if she had dropped it when startled.

"AXEL!" A voice, heavily muffled, shouted from the other side of the door. A thump, thump. Someone was trying to get in. Barrow, obviously. I went in without him, he hadn't shut the door behind me! He was trying to stop me, then trying to come in after me! How was I so stupid, to fall for such a simple seduction?

I didn't know if I should shout and alert Ramata that I was awake. She crept without making a noise, all the way up to the door. Her upper body was a woman, naked and covered by thick blankets of black hair. She had arms for legs, ones so thin that I barely noticed the fingers at the end. They gripped the floor so gently, thumbs grasping stands of spider silk. Eight human arms in place of spider legs and abdomen larger than her body, one that ended in a small mandible that had a thick strand of webbing.

One that led directly up to me. I was spider food.

"He's mine." She yelled through the door, her voice entirely unchanged. If I didn't have eyes on her, I would have thought she was truly protecting a soulmate from a threat. "Go away, he loves me!"

"Let him go." Barrow shouted. "Or I will make a wish."

That got her attention. "You have the doll?" Then she laughed. "No, no no. Surely not. Even if you did, you'd be a fool. Let me alone with my love, we are meant to be together!"

"I will!" He swore. "Let him out!"

She glanced up at me and saw my open eyes. Her face was still the same, so gentle and inviting. Her eyes black as night. "You want to leave me?"

But her spell was broken. "Yeah. I don't want to be food."

"I wasn't lying, love. It is past dinner time and my children are starved. They have not eaten in so long."

It was then I noticed the little bodies in the room. Some still looked like children, but others were in the same form as the woman. Long, thin arms ending in horrifying, tiny hands. Some skittered about when spotted, little fingers carrying them up the walls and into the ceiling.

"I... I will let you go, but they will go hungry. My children..." She sobbed. "They always go hungry."

As promised, she got me down. She tore away at the silk with her normal arms, breaking it away as if it weren't stronger than any kind of glue. Then I was on the ground, little strands of spider webs dancing about, stuck to my face and clothes.

"Go to your friend before starvation outweighs my desire to live."

I obeyed and opened the door. It wasn't locked from my end. Barrow held an old doll in his hands, one made of cloth with little button eyes. He looked entirely indifferent at my survival, but still pulled me out of the room. For once, I was thankful for his apathy because it spared me the scolding I was due. He tucked the doll into his jacket and drew a deep breath.

"No more distractions, you wasted a lot of time in there."

"I almost died."

"Yeah, you did."

We pushed on. The cold was even more unforgiving now that I was warmed from the spider's trap. It had been very comfortable there, were my life not at stake. Tall Ben watched us from the windows, appearing oddly short. He was just a little taller than me, actually. When I made eye contact, he waved and put a finger to his lips as if he were sneaking about with us. Did he actually think we were friends, or was this some odd trap? He killed Keith, not me. That was not *us*. Finally we got to a place without windows, where stairs led downwards into some kind of basement. There was laughter down there. Creepy laughter, clearly from a man.

Barrow and I began our descent. There was light down there, coming from a room down one of the long halls. The staircase ended at a crossroads of three halls; the laughter and light came from the left. I could see a door that was cracked open, a dull bulb let enough into the hall that we could turn off our flashlights.

We approached the door to hear a one-sided conversation. When I was close enough to look inside, I saw the bald head of Tom standing near a large mirror. "You just have one of those voices where you say something and everyone turns their head." Was he talking to himself? "I mean it!" More of his laughing. "You are my sunshine in the morning, even on a cloudy day! You have such a bright smile, you just light up the room!"

He laughed away and turned slightly, a genuine smile wide upon his face. I got a look at the mirror and saw Em, just as she had been before he took a picture. She leaned against furniture in the mirror, awkwardly waiting for whatever Tom had to say next.

"We should eat together, like a date. We don't have to call it that, though. Obviously we are just friends. For now, that is." More laughing. I hated that laugh. "There are too many guys working at the café these days. You're outnumbered! You should ask Richard about that. People love pretty faces."

He lifted his head when she didn't say anything. "You look really uncomfortable. That whole thing that happened with your leg? I can't imagine how you feel." Tom put some plates on the counter. "I got rear ended a few days ago getting some groceries. I am still pretty upset, it bent up a perfectly good car.

"I think we could both use a hug." He began moving in the direction she was standing in the mirror so that his reflection approached her. "I could really use a hug, Em."

Yeah, that was enough waiting. Barrow and I stepped inside, which startled Tom. "W-what are... how did you?"

"Let her go." I demanded. "Let her go right now!"

"She wants to be here! We're friends! We've been talking for *days*!" Em began crying hysterically upon seeing her rescue. "Aren't we friends? Don't we have something?!"

She shook her head, full of rage. "No! No we aren't! I want out!"

"You said-"

"So you wouldn't hurt me!"

Tom swallowed, then lost his smile. "I won't let her out. I can't, it isn't something I can do. So just let her be happy here and go on your way. I can take care of her, you know. I love her."

"Let her out." Barrow echoed my command. "There has to be a way."

"There isn't. She's dead, okay! I just have her spirit here so she doesn't move on! Your friend died and I saved her!"

"She died because you stole her!" I shouted. There was a lamp nearby, one of three in the small apartment. I lifted it over his head. "YOU!"

"And you'll finish the job? You can't let her out! You can't, otherwise she will be fully dead!"

There had to be a way. Laura was a ghost, one that left her body and possessed a fly instead. There *had* to be a way to do the same thing. "You moved her from the camera to the mirror! How did you do that?!" The lamp was ready to fall on his head. I wanted to hurt him. "How?!"

"Tell us or I will break it." Barrow threatened. He had the camera in his hands. "I will."

"No, don't!" Finally, Tom sounded afraid. "Don't break it! I swear, I promise on my own life and any god, I cannot put her back!"

For a moment, Barrow only stared at Tom. Then he lowered his arm, about to set the camera down. "You are certain?"

"Yes, I am. I moved her to the mirror by sticking her photo to the back of it. A mirror is just an image, after all! That won't work on bodies. I have... I have tried."

"Then we have no need of this." He slammed the camera onto the table, shattering the lens. Snapping plastic, exposing electronic parts within. Then he crushed it again, before Tom could cry out in pain.

"Please, please! That is my only-" Smash, smash. Tom began to weep. "My camera..."

"It is okay, Tommy." A woman's voice, one that was so soft and gentle. "It'll be okay."

"No, no it won't. I can't just buy another one."

Ramata crossed her arms and leaned against the doorframe. "If you need someone to talk to, you can come to my room. We can sit on my bed and talk about whatever you want." That smile, so overwhelming. "Come on. You don't need that camera to make friends."

"I... I suppose we can talk." He looked at Barrow and I. "I certainly don't enjoy this company." We did not stop him as he pushed past us.

"Upstairs. On your right, towards the front door. Second to last." She called after him as he hurried towards her apartment. "He will do. Much more fat than you, my love. Tom has been a meal out of my reach for so long, that camera has captured many of my daughters throughout the years. My sons are much too small to harm him. Thank you.

"And, Axel?" She smiled. "Promise I won't eat you next time." Then she left, following Tom. "Wait up! I need to make dinner!"

Em was standing close to the mirror, her eyes red and face stained. "I didn't think anyone was coming. He kept trying to... trying to..."

"Its okay." Barrow stopped her. "We are going to get you out of there."

"How?" I asked.

He hesitated. "We can take the mirror to the shop and ask Selene. She must know something."

"And if it breaks on the way?"

Barrow moved his jaw as he thought. "I can't risk that. She'd be gone." He stared off at nothing, as if he had a plan that he hated more than anything. "There is... one way." Then he fished the doll back out of his jacket. "One way."

"No, Barrow. There has to be something else."

"There isn't."

"There must be!"

"What is that?" I was in the dark. "I am confused."

Barrow gripped it tight, then looked up at me. "It is a curse. My curse." He looked back down, resisting the urge to tear it apart. "It grants wishes, but at a terrible price."

"But we can wish her back into her body?"

"Not we." Barrow placed the doll on the kitchen's counter. "You."

"What?"

In silence, Barrow stared at the cloth toy. "I made a... loophole. It is cursed to be at my side for all eternity, begging for another wish to be made. Torturing me at all hours until I make my next wish." Unlimited wishes didn't sound bad. "But it hurts people. The wishes are not good. I could wish for a friend, only to have someone's entire family die so that I was the only one left for them to speak to. It is an evil thing. A curse."

He held it out to me. "One that I must pass to you, if you want her free."

I didn't want a curse. "Why can't you make the wish?"

"I made a wish to trick it. I can't make any more wishes with it. It was a bluff I made with the spider." Again, he held it out. "But it is stuck to me until someone else asks for it. Only then can I give it away. I have to grant your wish."

"But I will be cursed?"

"Yeah. It isn't pretty."

"But it can be tricked?"

"It only begs for another wish when the previous one is granted. Find a wish it cannot grant and it will be stuck forever."

"And what did you wish?"

Barrow stared at the doll. "I wouldn't tell, otherwise you may try to do the same thing."

"Why don't we just destroy it afterwards?"

"Because it comes back. It is a part of you once you make your first wish. It cannot leave, not even if you die."

I looked at Em, who was waiting in the mirror. She wanted out, but she did try to enslave me. Why would I encumber myself with a curse for her sake? Em saw that look in my eye and let out a long breath. "Don't do it, Axel. Don't. I've seen what it does to Barrow, but he can't feel. You can. It isn't worth it."

She wasn't worth it? No. Selene said I had a good heart and that the forest would try to eat it. I wasn't going to let it. "It was your father that made you do it, I know that. I know you don't want to hurt people. I... forgive you."

More tears. Em covered her mouth and looked away, which is when Silence decided to make her appearance. She slivered out of my jacket so that her head was showing. "And I don't even remember what you did to me. But if it gets us out of here, then I forgive you too." Then she looked up at me. "But not you. You almost got us eaten."

"I didn't make you come."

"You brought the snake?" Barrow asked.

"You found the snake?" Em was entirely surprised.

"Her name is Silence. And yes to both of you, obviously." It took strength, what came next. I had to work myself up to it, override my survival instincts that told me it was a terrible idea, what I was about to do. "Em, I forgive you, and you do not owe me for this." Then I turned to Barrow. "I wish that doll was mine."

Em slammed her fists on the glass. "NO!"

When the doll entered my hands, it was warm. Very warm. It started to burn, so I put it down. My hands felt like fire even when it was gone. "What is going on?" I backed up. Pain. Random pricks all throughout my body, inside me, in my head. "What do I do?!"

"Make the next wish!"

"What do you want, Axel?" The doll whispered. "Anything at all. Make a wish."

"Put Em back in her body!"

"Done." The pain vanished, Em was no longer in the mirror. "Next?"

I started heating up again. "Make her well! Healthy, like she was before Tom came!"

"Done."

Again, the heat reset but started climbing.

"Think of something that will take a long time. Something it can't do, something impossible!"

"Break my deal with Rykar."

Barrow shook his head. "That won't work! You can't wish to undo a wish!"

"What is the Pillar King?!"

It hesitated as the heat vanished. "King of Flesh, the Eye of Gold. The Leader of All Men. Next?"

"The more wishes you make the slower the fire comes!"

I'd have to make a lot, it was coming back fast. "What is the Eye of Gold?!"

Again, it took a second, as if it did not enjoy the question. "The Witness of Flesh, one of many Watchers."

There had to be something that it couldn't do. "Show me!"

"What?" It asked.

Barrow titled his head. "It's never done that before."

"Show me the Golden Eye!"

"Done."

The room vanished and I was in a field. The grass was up to my knees, greener than any I had ever seen. Above me was an expanse of black sky that went on for eternity, covered in stars that seemed to breathe with life of their own. Then, from the deepest part of the sky, came a brilliant golden light. It was clothed in storm clouds that swirled about it, like a hurricane only larger than the world itself. The golden light became a colossal eye, dismembered from a body. As it came closer, I saw that the gold was infected by a deep red, coating half the eye in crimson. The pupil watched closely, curiously, and then it stopped approaching.

The winds of its storm were so distant, and the ocre-red lightning within thundered so loudly that I could hear it from an impossible distance.

"It is seen." The doll began pulling me back to the room.

"Speak to it. I wish you would say something to the eye."

"No."

"You can refuse a wish?"

"Your wish cannot force me to speak to another."

It was getting hotter. "I wish to stay until I say otherwise." The scene solidified again. "What should I call this god? I wish to know what is proper."

"The God of Ocre. The Gardener."

Again, the heat reset. I stepped forward. "Oh Gardener! You are the Witness of Flesh! Will you accept a sacrifice?!" I shouted, assuming it was far too distant to hear me.

Black tendrils approached the ground, like tornadoes from a great storm. Bloody flesh fell from the sky in shapes that resembled creatures. They struck the ground and gurgled, trying to breathe with their malformed lungs. Gross.

Something that looked like a large man landed near me. Its stomach was a mouth. "What would you offer, o' Fatewriter?"

"This doll." I held out the cursed toy.

"This is not a gift, Fatewriter. Give to me a promise, and I will take this thing from you."

The mouth was so wet when it spoke, as if it hungered for my flesh. "What promise?"

"Sweet things, Fatewriter. Whisper to me sweet promises of what you will do for me, and I shall take this burden from thy flesh and spirit. For I am the Gardener, the Eye of Gold and Crimson. The flesh and spirit are mine to witness."

The eyeless woman told me to write. "I will write."

"So sweet." The mouth smacked. "But what shall ye write?"

"What would you have me write?"

"Mmm. Of the world you see, in your dreams. It is a true one. Speak kindly, and say you will write."

"I will."

"The taste of your words are pleasant, o' Fatewriter. I shall have this thing you have brought." The doll began to burn, but I could no longer hear it. "So sweet are its screams. Ah, it is so good on my ears. I would hear more of this. Goodbye, Fatewriter."

With impossible speed, the eye vanished into the dark sky. The fleshy things remained, groping about on the ground and eating the grass as if starved of any nutrients. I only remained for a moment before I too was taken away, back into Tom's room. I stood with Barrow, my hands empty. The counter was empty too; the doll was gone.

"What... what did you do?"

I was making way too many deals lately. "I got rid of the doll."

"How?!"

"I asked a higher power."

"Huh." He shrugged, indifferent. "I guess we can leave."

Thinking it was over since Em was saved, we went to the door all too casually. When we stepped past Ramata's door, we heard sucking sounds. I guess Tom was being drained. Ew. John was at the door, inside the building. That should have driven the cryptids away. As we got closer, he lifted his hands to reveal the dim necklace and gem.

"Guess it didn't last long." He shrugged, handing the necklace and gem to Barrow. "Good thing Tall Ben can't get in, right?"

Only, he left the door open. A slightly taller person than me, maybe six-two, swung open the outward rotating door. "The building is on fire, get out!"

It was Tall Ben, I knew the voice, but John wasn't used to it. In a panic to not be burned alive, he obeyed instantly. The moment his arm left the doorway, he was snatched by the wrist. As Tall Ben stepped backwards, he got taller and taller.

"This guy and I are going back to my place. Now, are you two going to be good friends and come with?"

Barrow leaned over. "He will kill us all."

"I know."

"Is it bad that I wish you still had the doll?"

"Careful." I replied, worried it might come back. "Let him go, Ben. Please. You already got meat."

"Don't need meat. I need a friend." He stared a moment longer, but I had nothing. "Very well. Let's go, fella. I've got some games we can play."

Quicker than I could blink, Tall Ben was vanishing into the trees. I heard John cry out to his brother, but he did not say his last name.

"Dan! DAN!" The young man cried out. "DAN!"

And suddenly Dan was there, at the treeline, watching Tall Ben take his little brother away.

"I'll take your place!" John's distant scream echoed. "I'll take your place!!"

With that, his cries went quiet. Dan turned to face us, only his eyes were no longer yellow. He was... normal. Tall Ben appeared once more, grabbing him by the waste. "NO MORE TRICKS!" He roared, waving him at us. Dan screamed., but Tall Ben reached the height of the trees. What could we do? "COME OUTSIDE!"

I couldn't let the forest eat me. I had to do something, so I took a chance and stepped out the door. Maybe Ben was a friend, maybe he could be reasoned with.

There was no time to react. He reached to grab me so fast that I could not have cried out before his fingers gripped my leg. Only, he did not pull me into the air. Instead, he dropped Dan and cried out. Tall Ben covered his eyes, screaming in pain, before tumbling away into the night.

"Now how do you expect to hold your end of the deal if you are dead?" Rykar tsked. "Try to get yourself killed again, and you're mine. Right now, you are more useful alive." He glanced at the sky. "But I do like a good race. You are stressed for time. I think dawn is soon."

How had so much time gone by? Was I *really* in the spider's room for *that* long?! "We have to go!" I yelled at Dan, helping him to his feet. Barrow followed after me as we raced the daylight.

"Thanks for the trade, Dan. I'm excited to work with your little brother!" He laughed as we ran away, not having any time to entertain his taunts.

The sun lit up the sky, coming closer and closer to the trees as we dodged bush and branch. I almost hit a tree, tripped up, but recovered quickly. We were down to seconds, I couldn't afford to fall. Fire in my legs, worse than what the doll delivered. My lungs burned, my head throbbed, and my throat did not agree with the frigid air I breathed in. But I moved faster, I had to move faster, the sun was starting to touch the top of the trees!

Then the shop came into sight. It was snowing lightly when I saw that beautiful café. We were safe. But the windows were shattered, a door hung loosely by a single hinge and the other was nowhere to be seen. Selene stepped out and hurried over, quickly noting John's absence.

"Where is Kitchen Boi?"

I was suddenly thankful that Selene didn't use real names. "Gone. He's gone."

"DeGuire?"

“Whoa whoa!” Barrow put up his hands. “He’s back!”

“Oh!” Selene covered her mouth. “Your name is yours, Dan DeGuire. I do not own it. People have to stop introducing themselves to me when we meet.”

“That is how meeting people works.”

“How’d you get him back?”

I opened my mouth to answer, but I was gone. Everything was black. Had I passed out?

Suddenly I was back in the field. The grass was so soft. Above me, the eye was gone but the fleshy things still labored along. They wandered aimlessly, looking for anything to feed their bellies. Well, some of them didn't have bellies. They wanted food, I think. That assumption came when I felt teeth sink into my lower leg, gnawing at my ankle. Digging deep, all the way to the bone. I tried to kick it off, but another leapt and grabbed my side. I could feel my flesh being stripped away, slurped down the throat of an abomination. I screamed, but there was no one to hear me. I was only food, meat and bone, and I would be satiate the same.

Then, as suddenly as I left, I was back in the parking lot of the café. Blood poured from my wounds and Selene was calling an ambulance. I couldn't stay conscious, not with that much blood on the ground. Sleep found me, so I rested.

And that is it so far. I recovered, but my right foot is super messed up. It took a few days to get back to health, I was nearly dead from blood loss when they got me to the hospital. Now I am back on the floor, wondering if the new DeGuire was out there. If he was being tortured by Rykar, if it would have been best to let Tall Ben have him.

Also, why did I go back to the plane of The Gardener? I don’t have a doll to give me answers. Maybe Selene knows.

But that is not a decision I can make. I can't go back. I've made so many deals in the last few days, I don't know who I owe what. So, if you meet a devil, find a special doll, or are visited by an eldritch God of Flesh, do me a favor; don't make any deals, just go on your way. They are more trouble then they are worth.

Oh, and Merry Christmas. Happy New Year too. I hope yours was better than mine.
