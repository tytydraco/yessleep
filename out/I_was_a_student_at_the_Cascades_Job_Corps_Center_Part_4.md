The red-lit tunnel stretched endlessly before us. The deeper we went, the more the walls changed as cement gave way to metal, the dim emergency lighting casting long shadows over sterile, industrial corridors.

At the end of the passage was a door. Unlike the others, this one was reinforced steel, a keycard scanner mounted beside it. But someone had left it unlocked.

Or maybe… they wanted us to find it.

I pushed it open.

Inside, the office was unsettlingly clean. A large desk. Filing cabinets, meticulously organized. Medical equipment lining the walls. A laptop sat open, casting a dull glow over the papers beside it. The old Department of Labor insignia was stamped across some of them, but most had a different logo.

“‘LifeSkills’? What’s that?” I muttered.

Andre, clasping his arm in pain “LifeSkills is the company which the Department of Labor contracts with,” he explained “but… their dropping the contract soon.”

Sitting behind the desk at the back of the room was a man, sitting silently, who we hadn’t noticed at first.

Tall. Late fifties, maybe early sixties. Silver hair combed back neatly. His suit was expensive, but he wore a lab coat over it, as if he couldn’t decide which role was more important. His posture was composed, his hands folded before him. But his eyes cold, piercing blue, studied us like specimens in a petri dish.

“You’ve been busy,” he said.

I could hear Tony’s breath hitch behind me. Lex shifted his weight, subtly readying himself for a fight.

The man sighed, as if this was all a mild inconvenience. “Breaking into restricted areas. Trespassing in classified facilities. I expected more from you.” He glanced at Kelsey. “Especially you, Ms. Brooks.”

She stiffened.

“Who the hell are you?” Lex demanded.

The man considered the question before answering.

“My name is Dr. Everett Vance,” he said finally. “I oversee operations here.”

Kelsey’s hands curled into fists. “Operations? You mean the people you’re torturing? The ones you’re experimenting on?”

Vance didn’t flinch. “You use such dramatic language,” he said. “Experimentation. Torture. No, Ms. Brooks. What we do here is research.”

A cold weight settled in my gut.

“What kind of research requires kidnapping people?” I snapped.

Vance tilted his head slightly. “I think you misunderstand the nature of this place.” He gestured around the room, as if the answer was obvious. “You were all so eager to believe in the illusion. Job Corps. A second chance for the underprivileged. Training for the workforce. Stability.” He smiled, “But what is this program, really? Government-funded housing. Cheap labor. Young people with no connections, no safety net, no one who will ask questions if they were to go… missing. We have a system that takes in those with nowhere else to go and repurposes them into something more… useful.”

I clenched my jaw.

“You’re using the students,” Tony murmured, horror creeping into his voice.

Vance nodded, as if explaining a simple truth. “We all use them. LifeSkills. The Department of Labor. Even the corporations that “hire” from these programs.” His gaze flickered toward the medical equipment. “The difference is, my work acknowledges reality. This system is built to produce workers, not people. You are not here to thrive. You are here to be made compliant.”

Lex’s voice was low, dangerous. “LifeSkills is behind all of this. Why are they dropping their contract with the Department of Labor”?

Vance exhaled sharply, as if annoyed by the question. “LifeSkills is a business, Mr. Carter. A business that thrives on perception. Their investors expect results. Workforce development. Rehabilitation.” He waved a hand. “But my research? It does not produce profitable results. Some subjects… fail to adapt.”

He meant *die*.

“Not to worry,” Vance sighed “We will simply pack up and resume our research elsewhere.”

Tony narrowed his eyes. “Then why do it? If it’s not profitable, what’s the point?”

Vance studied him, as if mildly impressed by the question.

“The problem with capitalism,” he said finally, “is that it still relies on cooperation.”

He turned his laptop towards us and tapped a key. The screen flickered, showing images of former students. Not in their homes, not out in the world, but locked up in holding cells. All of them had a thin scar along their foreheads, resembling the one we saw on Rachael. They looked… lifeless, like their souls had been drained.

“Despite every economic incentive,” he continued, “people resist. They unionize. They strike. They sabotage. They rebel. Even those at the bottom, those with no other options, still find ways to defy the role they’ve been given.” He gestured toward the screen. “My work seeks to remove that defect.”

A pit formed in my stomach.

“You’re not just experimenting on them,” Kelsey said, her voice almost a whisper. “You’re trying to make them… obedient.”

Vance inclined his head. “Compliance is efficiency, Ms. Brooks. Imagine a workforce that never questioned its conditions. That never demanded higher wages. That never dreamed of resistance.” He exhaled, almost wistfully. “You cannot beat disobedience out of people. You cannot threaten them into submission forever. But you can rewire the process before it begins.”

He gestured toward the medical equipment. “We are refining techniques that will, in time, make disciplinary measures obsolete. A worker who cannot conceive of rebellion will never need to be subdued. A workforce engineered for efficiency will never demand rest. If perfected, this process could eliminate conflict entirely.”

I felt sick.

You’re not making workers,” Lex said, voice low and furious. “You’re making *slaves*.”

Vance sighed. “How very dramatic.”

Kelsey stepped in “Does… does the Department of Labor know about your ‘research’? There’s no way they let you get away with this.”

Vance chuckled “The DoL is one of our biggest contributors! What? You actually thought they cared about the conditions of the workforce?

“They’ll throw a bone every now and then, just enough to prevent people from realizing the truth” Vance continued, “but at the end of the day, they are interested in the same thing we are. A profitable workforce.”

Tony stepped forward. “What did you do to  Rachael?”

Vance raised an eyebrow.

“The girl outside,” Tony pressed. “What did you do to here?”

For the first time, Vance’s expression changed. A flicker of something, curiosity, maybe even mild amusement. “Ah. *Rachael*.”

He leaned against the desk, steepling his fingers. “I suppose you could say she was one of my more successful subjects.”

Kelsey’s breath caught. “What the hell does that mean?”

Vance glanced at one of the monitors. The screen flickered, cycling through security feeds throughout the campus. “Her body rejected the treatment,” he said simply. “She lasted longer than most, but ultimately, she was not viable.”

I swallowed hard. “Is she going to survive?”

Vance tilted his head slightly, as if deciding whether the question even mattered. “Not for much longer.”

Tony’s jaw clenched.

“We can still save her,” Kelsey said quickly. “We can get her out.”

“No,” Vance interrupted, his voice sharp. “Even if she were stable enough to move, even if she somehow survived the next twenty-four hours, where would you take her? A hospital?” He chuckled, shaking his head. “You think I operate alone? That this facility is the only one of its kind? That there aren’t people in high places ensuring this research continues?”


A buzzing sound filled the room.

I turned just in time to see the laptop screen flicker, then the security feeds changed.

Students. Walking the halls. Going about their day.

Then the image changed. A different hallway. The exit.

Security officers. Dozens of them.

Vance had already called them.

“We’re taking Rachael,” Kelsey spat at Vance, “and we’re getting the hell out of here.”

“You think you’re leaving?” Vance asked in a curious tone, “and do you really think she can be saved?” Vance turned towards me, grinning.

My stomach dropped.

A knock at the door.

Then another.

And then the handle started to turn.
