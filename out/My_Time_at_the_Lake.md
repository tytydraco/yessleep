I came out here to get away. I came out to this boat to get away from everything and now it just won’t let me. I know this is confusing and I know I already sound crazy but I just need to talk to someone, ANYONE about what's going on and I don’t even remember why I came out here so while I explain my situation to you I’ll try to put the pieces together myself. Let me start from the beginning. Last thing I remember before the lake was getting a text from my friend Rob, or Bill, or something with a B, he reached out and told me about some boat he was trying to flip he got from an estate sale, “a real beaut he said” I remember him having an accent. In the process of him selling it he needed someone to go out to stay on it until it was sold and fix anything that was wrong with it. I don't remember if I asked why he couldn’t do it himself but either way I told him I would go out there for him. 

A few days after that I took the five hour drive through the endless desert out of town to get to the lake the boat was left on. When I pulled into the marina’s parking lot there were only two or three other cars there, they were old and didn’t look like they had been touched in months. I grabbed my bag and walked onto the dock as I felt the scorching heat beat down on me. As I approached the marina I walked under the cracked paint of  a rickety sign made from the kind of old wood you find in the desert that looked so worn and so warped you could feel the splinters just by looking at it. The sign said “Welcome to Waitly Marina” Walking down the dock I  passed pier  after pier after pier, finally reaching pier five. While this marina was nowhere near full the boat I was going to stay on was as far from the entrance as possible and had no other boats docked around it. I stepped onto the front deck and picked up the key from under the doormat which appropriately said “Welcome aboard!”. I unlocked the sliding door and stepped inside. I looked around and was pretty impressed with the size of the boat, it was split into two sections: an upper deck and a lower deck. 

The upper deck had a small kitchen that wasn’t too bad ignoring the rotting food in the fridge, the filthy pots and pans in the sink, and the trash can overflowing with beer cans, the steering wheel which no surprise didn’t even budge, and a couch that looked to have been used as a bed and was unfortunately going to be my bed. The lower deck was a lot more eerie, it was a hoarder’s wet dream, crates and boxes everywhere but strangely out of place was a table covered with newspapers and not books, almost like some kind of research station. I ignored the junk and immediately went to check if this thing had air conditioning. I was starting to feel noxious from the heat, fortunately with one flick of a switch I heard the air come on. Once I was settled I called my friend to tell him I made it out but there was no answer, so I left a message.
“Hey man, I made it out. Keep me updated with what the word is on selling this thing ahead of time so I can find somewhere else to stay. Talk to you later, bye”.

That night I was fixing the sink since it wouldn’t drain while I was trying to clean the feast’s worth of dishes whoever was here left but then I heard a knock at the door. I stood up and slowly approached the window and looked through the blinds. Some tall, lengthy guy was looking around the front deck for something. I slid the door open and asked, “Can I help you?” he stopped what he was doing like someone who just got caught committing a crime. 

“Oh uhh, no sorry I work for the marina, I was just curious to see who the new captain was.” His attempt to joke was not amusing. 

“Well you met him so…” I said as I gestured for him to get off the boat, as I turned to go back inside he stopped me, “ You don’t know who he was, do you?” 

“What?” I responded. He almost looked like he was trying to hide his excitement as he walked towards the edge of the deck, “The last guy who lived here, real creep, no one really got to talk to him much but from the things I heard” he paused and turned back towards me, “I wouldn’t want this thing” I would be lying if I said that didn’t get to me a little but I responded, “Get the fuck off my boat.” 

He stepped off the deck onto the dock and walked into the blackness that surrounded the boat. I walked back inside and felt incredibly uneasy. As all of a sudden I felt like something was watching me but not some passing feeling like the one you get when you wake up from a nightmare or the one you get when you're home alone and the cloths in your closet are shaped a little too much like a shadowy figure staring at you but more like there was something right behind me… breathing down my neck.

The next day I slept well into the afternoon and woke up convulsing and covered in sweat it felt like I had something scratching its way out of my stomach and I fell off the old scratchy sofa onto the hardwood floor and crawled over to the trash where I vomited up this blackish sludge with the consistency of cottage cheese, it had these little golden flakes sprinkled through it. I was taken back by the sight of it at the time. I didn't think much of it either because of me just waking up a few seconds prior or if I even really saw it, I don't know, like I said before I can't even  trust myself anymore. 

After an hour or so I was able to wake myself up a little more, sadly where I was lucky with the air conditioning working I was not so fortunate in the shower having running water. I decided to call my friend again and again no answer, “Hey man, it's me again, just waiting to hear back from you, I texted you a few times and you never answered so I just wanted to see if there was any updates with selling the boat but anyway call me back” I left the message while I paced around the lower deck. After hanging up I put the phone down on the table of what looked like the research station of whoever was here before me. The table was decorated with old torn newspapers, notebooks splayed out with missing pages, crates and chests made from peeling wood and rusty nails, and above the table was a fishing map of the lake the boat sat on scribbled with markers and a crudely drawn legend. Looking down at the table a greenish leather bound book stood out to me. It had the texture of tight, stitched skin and its shade of green did not look like it was dyed but more of a sickly color. Against my better judgment I lifted the book and began to flip through the pages but before I got a good look at any of the what seemed to be crudely drawn images a folded paper fell from between the pages I picked up the paper and unfolded it, it was a zoomed in part of the map and it looked to have the similar scribbles as the larger maps on the wall. I had nothing better to do on the boat so since the map showed somewhere relatively close to the doc entrance I decided to go investigate. 

After reaching the spot where the map was leading to I was disappointed to find nothing. I was surrounded by sand and beached tires that were at some point used as buoys but there was something that stood out to me, a large generator on a platform that was sinking into the sand. I walked over to it and I saw something under its platform, a small chest similar to the ones back on the boat. The chest was much newer than the things on the boat but in not much better condition, it had been wrapped in rope holding creepy looking red crucifix to it and the rope had been tied in a way of preventing it from being opened even if you could get the lock off, I had never been a superstitious person before then so I wrote it off and carried it back to the boat, despite its fishy smell.

By the time I got back to the boat the sun was starting to go down. I stepped into the boat and put the chest onto the table at the center of the upper deck, looking around I found a knife to cut the ropes off the chest causing the crucifix to fall onto the table where I noticed they weren’t red it was blood, or at least it was supposed to be from the little jesus’s head to his knees he was covered in blood and his face looked like he was screaming not the usual sad look on most crucifix. Even though the lock wouldn’t budge after a sturdy pull the hinges it was attached to came loose enough to pop off with my hands. Before opening it I saw crosses carved into the box, this finally stopped me for a second. I looked around and wondered if this was safe, sure I wasn’t religious and I didn’t believe in all the superstitions but maybe I should take the warning. All of a sudden in a blink I was holding something, the chest was open and I was holding a statue or idol? I don’t know what you would call it. But it's hard to describe what it was of, it looked like a lengthy thin man sitting on a cube curled into himself but his feet were the talons of a hawk and leather dragon wings were folded behind him as they hung down the back of the cube, but the face looked mostly human. Its eyes were closed and it was missing ears but its nose was that of a bat and its mouth looked like a splayed open flower that's opening reached all the way down the creature’s throat.

I was mesmerized by it but I was quickly snapped out of it as I felt a distinct three knock in the ground below me. I moved the table and dragged the rug under it away from the center of the room and now in its place was a trap door with what looked like small golden flakes in large burn marks around its edges where it met the rest of the floor. I knelt down to the door. I didn't even notice it was almost pitch black as there was no more sun to shine in through the windows. I slowly lifted it open and a bright red beam shined from inside the trapdoor. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. Barbed wire shot from the light’s origin and wrapped around me cutting into my skin as it tightened around my wrist and my neck. I felt blood start to drip from my hands and run down under my shirt as they tightened. Then once again, I woke up. 

I woke up the next day on the floor of the upper deck once again covered in sweat and coughing, I heard a knock at the door. I thought it was that dock worker snooping around again, I told him to stay off my boat after he tried to scare me. He insulted me. He threatened me. HE WAS HERE TO HURT ME. I thought about this as I stood up and stomped towards the door and I quickly forgot it as I forcefully slid open the door to see her standing there with her dark curly hair and in a nervous voice she said, 

“Hey you.” It was Sahra. Sahra is my girlfriend. I think we broke up. Quickly I straightened myself out and stepped to the side as I invited her in. “How have you been Lou?” I was dazed and couldn’t focus on what she was saying, I only then remembered what happened the night before. “Lou?”

 “Yeah, sorry” I came to again, “How are you?” I tried to smile, “Are you ok? It’s been weeks since I’ve seen you. You kind of just stormed out after we fought.” She was visibly uncomfortable. “It wasn’t like you.” I started to remember more from before I came to the boat. “Wait weeks? I’ve only been out here for a couple da…” I cut off my thought as I looked past her I saw him, that fucking dock worker was standing on the deck, he was smileing and waving through the window. That piece of shit was taunting me and I sprinted out the door throwing it open but as its frame slid across my vision he was gone, I stepped out onto the deck and looked around like a mad dog panting almost growling. Sahra followed after and asked “Lou what's going on?” that's the last thing I remember hearing, I know she kept trying to get my attention but I couldn’t hear her. She tried to grab my hand but I snapped and screamed at her, “Don’t fucking touch me!” she stumbled back and looked at me in fear as tears started running down her face. She turned around and walked down the dock as the sun set.

I went back inside and looked down at the exposed trapdoor, I ignored it and went into the bathroom as I looked into the mirror and saw the scars from the wire across my neck and up my forearms. I walked into the lower deck and saw the green book, this time I flipped through it more focused on seeing something, what I thought were scribbled drawings were clearly now some kind of ritualistic depictions of sacrifice, some “Blood Eagle” type shit. As I looked through the book I heard singing from behind me on the wall on either side of the bathroom door where two singing fish both started singing “Bad Moon Rising” but quickly stopped. Then after a few seconds they turned back to me and said in unison, “Gift from god.” they started chanting, “Gift from god, gift from god, gift from god!” I ran to the upper deck and saw a shotgun leaning against the wall, I grabbed it and pointed it towards the lower deck but out of nowhere this giant hulk of a figure stood in front of me and in a quick motion took the gun out of my hands and kicked me to the floor I looked back up and both the figure and the gun were gone, the boat started to shake as I began to hear banging on the roof like I was at the center of a hail storm. As I curled into a ball praying for the first time in my life for this to stop, and then it stopped and it was quiet I cautiously stepped outside onto the dock. From the small spotlight from the deck of the boat I can see the deck and the roof of the boat are both covered in fish still flopping. 

I look down the dock into the darkness, and the shadows creep closer as I feel my feet become cold and wet, I am sinking into something, some dark red sea of death and I begin hands pulling me down deeper. I was beginning to drown but I felt a flat surface. I begin to kick and push on it and when it finally gives in I climb out of the trap door and crawl across the floor soaking wet. At that point I realized I would never leave this boat. I slept on the floor that night as I cried myself to sleep.

Over the course of the next day I woke up in the study, I woke up to knocking again, this time more assertive than aggressive. The sun burned my eyes and I was barely able to get to the door without closing all the blinds first. When I finally slid the door open, shielding my eyes as they adjusted. I saw someone about my height wearing a blue shirt as he stood behind a taller broader shape wearing a large hat and the glint of a badge on its waist, “Mr. Williams…”. The taller one said, “I’m Adam Green, I’m with the county, may we come in, I have a few questions about Sarah Adelaide .” I let the two in. 

The man in the blue walked past me barely acknowledging me as he was annamered by the upper deck of the boat and as I went to sit down the deputy or sheriff or whatever stood in front of me and opened a small notebook. 

“I would offer you something to eat but I don’t really have much to eat,” I said. The tall John Wayne type ignored my offering and asked, “When was the last time you saw Ms. Adelaide?” “Yesterday I think? Why is everything ok?” I ask as I feel a sudden pounding in my head as I put my face in my hands,

“We don’t know anything yet sir…” He ignores my question “She was reported missing by her roommate a little over a month ago,” I felt a chill, “last anyone heard was that she was coming out here looking for you” I looked up from my palms and asked, “I’m sorry, did you say a month?” 

He took no time to respond “Yes sir, it’s been a couple days since we got the call but the owners of the marina called about an abandoned car, long story short were here now, when was the last time you heard from Ms. Adelaide?” I struggled to think, “I thought yesterday but I guess I’m a little confused” 

“It seems so what was your relationship with Ms. Adelaide?” He was rude, and inconsiderate “She is or was my girlfriend, wait why did you say was? Do you think something happened to her?”  He scribbled something down. He thinks I did something to her.

“No sir, your neighbors mentioned overhearing an argument one would assume a disagreement your neighbors could hear would end any relationship the two of you might’ve had.” What the fuck does that mean? “Yeah we had a fight I guess I loss my temper” 

“Did your fight have anything to do with you purchasing the boat?” he asked “No, I’m just watching it for a friend.” He finally looked up from his notes and looked at the man in blue “That’s not what I have here Mr. Williams…” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Mr. Williams, this boat is under your name, this boat is yours.” My heart sank, I looked between the two of them. “You seem pretty confused Mr. Williams, give me a call if you think of anything.” He gave me a paper and then two of them walked out past me but the man in blue stopped.

“It’s pretty crazy finally seeing the inside of this place, normally we’re not allowed on the residents boats, the last guy who lived here was a creep.” I responded “I’ll keep that in mind next time I see the other guy I’ll keep that in mind.” 

“Other guy? Which other guy?” I attempted to joke “The other dock worker, the one without the baby blue uniform.” The dock worker stared for a second “Right… Have a nice day Mr. Williams.” 

I didn’t move for the rest of the day. Not to lock the door after they left. Not for hours until I heard knocking coming from the lower deck. I stood up and stormed down the stairs looking for something in the research area, anything to tell me what the hell is wrong with this boat, and then I looked up and locked eyes with that goddamn statue. I grabbed it and marched towards the exit and as I stood at the edge of the dock and looked down into the palm of my hand where the visage of that mutation and without second thought I threw it out into the darkness of the lake, it disappeared into the shadow but it made no splash. I stood there for a second waiting as I felt stillness like the whole world stopped spinning, like the lake I stood on was now waveless. I took a deep breath and tried to take in the last bit of peace I would ever experience as the stillness was interrupted by the thunder of sprinting footsteps on the dock quickly approaching me, at the last second I turn and I am tackled onto my splintered dock as a familiar tall lengthy man crouches above me as he bashes the same idol I tried to drown into my face while I feel the bones in my face crack on the shaped stone. Eventually I fell limp and only felt my collar being pulled as I was dragged across the dock back onto my boat. My eyes were swollen shut and I was choking on my own blood but I could hear him throw open the trap door, he said “Look at it, it’s beautiful, it’s perfect our lord of flies shines his light for you and you are ungrateful.”

I gained enough strength to reach into my pocket and find my keys. I put each of them in between my fingers and stood to my feet as I threw myself towards where I hoped he would be and luckily I felt the keys stab into his side between his ribs. He grabbed me by the throat and slammed me onto the floor as my head hung off the edge of the floor into the trapdoor. I was able to break his grip and head butt him as I felt a tooth sticking out of my forehead. I climbed on top of him and began punching but as my vision slowly came back the punches I threw became more violent. My vision was then clear and I saw him covering his face, I pulled his hands back and began to bash my head into his face over, and over, and over, and over. I finally pulled back my head after god knows how long and as his blood run from the tooth dentend in my forehead past my broken nose into my mouth and touch my tongue I felt my jaw begin to break and reshape as my teeth grew into jagged fangs and once again I plunged my head into his neck as I tasted his blood and began to drain the life from his body. Where he saw himself as a profit of some primordial deity living in this lake, he was really a sacrifice to the birth of me, a new god. 

The next morning I woke up with my nails stabbed into the ceiling as I hung perched facing the door, finally being greeted by once again a knock. I crawled across the ceiling, dropped onto the upper deck, and opened the door to see Adam Green. “Good morning Mr. Williams, may I come in?” I stepped out of the way welcoming him in. As he stepped in he started with, “I thought I would come back to see if I could ask you a few more questions, you seemed pretty out of it yesterday sir.” 

“I guess I was” I didn’t care about what questions he had, I just wanted to wait for a chance to bite. “This is a nice boat sir, you know my dad had one just like it, I've been meaning to do something with it for a while now” “Is that right” I was getting eager, I started drooling as all things in my vision that wasn't him began to blur, I was so focused it was like I could see the blood pumping through his veins. “Yeah, the family spent a whole year livin’ out here…” He hung his head as he reminisced, once again I felt my jaw crack and my teeth grow. I opened my mouth as I prepared myself to bite, until he asked his first question. “Have you checked the trap door?” I felt a chill, 

“The trap door?” 

“Yeah we had one on ours, the whole reason we spent so long out here was because our house burnt down at the beginning of the summer so in a way of saying the breaks not ruined my parents took us out to live on the lake for a couple months but a couple months turned into a through the winter…” I gave a suspicious look as I noticed his hand holding the gun on his hip,

“... but once it started heating up one day we woke up to scratching from under the floor and a rancid smell, it didn't take long for my dad to check the cargo and the second he opened it, it was like looking into a nightmare. A family of rats must've gotten stuck in there over the winter but there was one left eating the rest of them, the size of a small cat clawing and screaming on top of a pile of fleshy bodies. We spent the next two days filling trash bags of rat bodies and throwing them overboard.” 

“Why are you telling me this, what's your point?” He unclipped his gun, keeping it in  its holster,

“Because Lou the second you opened the door today I smelled the same thing I did all those years ago, call it morbid curiosity but I'm pretty sure you got something bigger than some inbred rat down there.” Then in a stern voice he said “Open it.” I stood for a second looking down at his gun then back up to him before pulling away the old rug and kneeling before the cursed splintered wood of the trap door. I looked up at him and said “Witness” I stayed staring at him as he quickly pulled his gun and a horrified expression came across his face. 

“What the fuck?!”

I turned away from him and looked into the trap door as I saw Sarah laying in the darkness of the trapdoor, her clothes were soaked in sweat and her neck was covered in bite marks like a dog attacked her. She was barely alive as her eyes were barely open and she had small jolts of movement. 

“No… No, I couldn’t do this” all the new power I felt was gone as I felt shock and disbelief,

“Lou put your hands behind your head, now!” I was taken out of my shock as I stood up and stumbled towards the lower deck, 

“Lou stop!” Mr. Green shouted seconds before I felt a bullet tear through my ribs and burst out the front of my chest. I fell down the stairs and crawled across the floor of the lower deck and out the back door onto the rear deck. I used all my strength to stand on my feet and felt the sun beginning to set. I stood there using the railing to support my weight. From behind me I heard “Lou stop, get on your knees and I'll help you…” Mr. Green stood there in the doorway with his gun pointed at me “...you're losing a lot of blood” I looked down at the puddle of blood I was now standing in. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and charged the marshal. Just as fast as I stepped to him I felt two more gunshots tear through me as I went over the railing into the water.

I sunk at first, deeper and deeper into the darkness, until I saw a light above the surface. I swam towards it fighting to get out of the water, I was just about to reach the surface before I began to feel hands pull me down, yanking on my clothes and grabbing my ankles and as I swam I kicked and punched the aggressors I felt the water begin to boil but once I broke the grip I made it to the surface and I climbed out of the opening of the trapdoor back onto the deck of the boat.

I am trapped here, I don’t know how I got here or what is going on but this is hell this boat is an infection and it has cursed me, every time I try to get off this dock I end up in that boiling river of hate. All evidence left of the marshal's visit is a trail of blood across the boat and bullet holes that look to have scared a long time ago. Whatever you do, don't come look for me. Who knows how many people it's done this to already but I won’t let it happen to anyone else. I'm going to try to start a fire and let it sink into the lake. I don't know what will happen to me but I'll be the last monster this thing creates. For your own good stay away from Hoover Lake, stay away from Weightly Bay, and for the love of god don't step on pier five.
