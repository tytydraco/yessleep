Deep in the woods located in the interior of British Columbia Canada harboured darkness and utter tragic events one after another, people ended up going missing, people that have given up and had many worried and yet some not at all. Many locations within the interior had forgotten and lost tombs or what most would call them abandoned mine shafts, some buried deep under rubble and what is now developed land and cities. Others weren't in the same boat however, deep within mass water routes lied hidden places of what I refer to as hell itself, to begin this tale is like painting an absolute picture of the situation and what transpired during the years of 2013 - 2015.

2013 March 21st:

A report came in to a local ranger office near a Revelstoke Forrest that two local hikers had gone missing over two weeks ago and were reported to be in the area after RCMP officials found an abandoned vehicle belonging to the missing persons. These two hikers happened to be having marital issues reported by officials after the fact and found threats of killing themselves while searching through old twitter post from the couple, this put them as high risk and needed to be found as the family of the two were very concerned at this point.

The ranger who received the report remembered that the car that was found had only been there for two days which meant the hikers couldn't be far. After a search that lasted to the 23rd the couple was found, the bodies were barely recognizable as they looked like they had been deceased long before two days ago when the car first appeared near the Forrest. The woman had knife wounds all over her body well only the head of the male was found, the rest of the body was never found and the womans genitalia was mangled as it seemed she was sexually assaulted with a large object before or after death. The reports of the event were only released at the time to the family and left as is.

2013 April 14th:

The RCMP at this point had no leads, no male body and seemed like cold case already, as April went on only on the 14th did the case develop as the male body was found but nowhere near the original location of the deceased. The body was found near Creston BC nearing the Alberta border, except one small detail was missing. The man's body seemingly complete was actually harvested of all his vital organs, autopsy reports concluded that it was done with extreme precision, no blood lose till the organs were harvested and all while the deceased was still alive. This left law enforcement in horror of what had happened, this again was not reported to local media and an investigation was now underway to catch an unknown killer.

Conclusion of Part One:

What one doesn't know always peaks an interest, as the curious normally encounter negative fates of utter darkness and regret. All things aside I have more to tell of these stories to spin about this tale, the disclaimer I provided will be in all parts as more will apply to others as this goes on. 

Have a good night ðŸŒ’
