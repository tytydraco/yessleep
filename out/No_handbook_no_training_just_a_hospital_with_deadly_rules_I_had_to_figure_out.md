Hospitals aren’t just for the sick and dying. Sometimes, they hold things that should have been dead long ago.

I learned that on my first night.

My name is Claire. I had just graduated from nursing school, and after what felt like an endless search, I finally got a job at Hospital. It felt like a dream come true. The stress of job hunting was over, and I could finally start my career. More importantly, I could finally support my mother.

She had been sick for a long time. Not the kind of sick that comes and goes, but the kind that slowly steals a person away, piece by piece. She could no longer speak, and her body had grown frail. The medical bills piled up faster than I could count, and the extra income from this job would help us both. I thought she’d be happy for me, relieved even.

But when I told her about the job, something changed.

Her expression twisted, not in anger or sadness, but something deeper. A kind of fear that I couldn’t quite place. Her already weak hands trembled as she reached for a pen and a scrap of paper. I stepped closer, holding my breath as she wrote, each stroke slow and deliberate.

When she turned the paper toward me, my stomach dropped.

"Don’t go."

That was it. Just two words. But those two words made my skin prickle with unease.

I tried to ask her why, but she only shook her head, slow and deliberate. Her eyes, sunken yet full of emotion, locked onto mine. She wanted to say more—I could feel it—but the words wouldn’t come.

I forced a smile, pretending it didn’t bother me. “Mom, it’s just a job. It’s a good hospital. I’ll be fine.”

She didn’t look convinced.

I told myself it was just her illness. Maybe she was scared of being alone. Maybe she was confused. But deep down, a small part of me knew it was something else.

Still, I ignored the feeling. I needed this job. We needed this job.

So, against my mother’s silent plea, I started my first night.

Night shifts paid more, so I signed up without hesitation. I figured it would be easier, quieter. Less chaos, fewer people. Just a few patients to check on, some paperwork, maybe a few emergencies here and there. No big deal.

But the second I stepped inside, I knew something was wrong.

The air was heavy, unnaturally still, like the hospital itself was holding its breath. The lights overhead flickered, not in the usual way fluorescent bulbs do, but like they were struggling to stay alive. The hum of the electricity was low, almost like a whisper.

The scent of antiseptic filled my nose—normal for a hospital, but something about it felt... off. Too strong. Almost like it was covering something up.

I took a deep breath and shook it off. First-day jitters. That’s all.

Then, I met Nurse Alden.

She had been working nights for years, or so I was told. She was tall, unnaturally thin, with pale skin that almost looked translucent under the hospital lights. But the thing that stuck with me—the thing that made my stomach twist—was her eyes.

She never blinked.

Not once.

I tried to introduce myself, to be polite. “Hi, I’m Claire. It’s my first—”

She didn’t let me finish. She just gave me a slow, almost robotic nod, then turned and walked away without a word.

Weird.

But I was new. Maybe she was just like that. Maybe night shift nurses were just... different.

I was assigned to restock supplies first. Easy enough. I wheeled a cart down the dimly lit hallway, past rooms where machines beeped softly, their screens casting a faint glow. The quiet was suffocating, pressing down on me like a weight.

And then, I heard it.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

A soft, deliberate knocking.

I froze. My breath caught in my throat.

It came from the window beside me.

The fourth-floor window.

There was no balcony. No ledge. Nothing that could be outside.

My first instinct was to turn and look. My hands twitched, my body tensed. But before I could move, I caught something in my peripheral vision.

Nurse Alden.

She was standing at the end of the hallway, perfectly still. Her eyes—those unblinking eyes—weren’t looking at the window.

She was looking at me.

Expressionless. Silent. Watching.

And then... she smiled.

A slow, knowing smile.

My stomach turned. Her smile made me uneasy.

She was staring at me—too intently.

As if this was a test.

As if failing would cost me my life.

I hesitated, confusion creeping in.

She had heard it too. 

I knew she had. But she wasn’t reacting. She wasn’t checking. She wasn’t concerned.

Why?

I wanted to ask, but my throat felt tight. Instead, I did what she did. I gripped the cart and kept walking, forcing my feet to move even as every instinct screamed at me to run.

That was when I learned Rule #1.

If you hear tapping on the window, do not look.

I tried to shake off the unease, but it clung to me like a second skin. No matter how much I told myself it was just nerves, that nothing was actually wrong, my body didn’t believe it. My hands were cold. My breathing felt too shallow.

I kept my head down, focused on the task at hand. Restock the supplies. Finish the rounds. Keep moving. That was all I had to do.

The halls felt too empty. The overhead lights buzzed softly, their flickering creating strange shadows on the walls. Every now and then, I thought I heard faint whispers—just beyond my hearing, just enough to make my pulse quicken. But every time I turned my head, the hallway was empty.

I forced myself to ignore it. It was a slow night. That was all.

Most of the patient rooms were empty. The few that were occupied had sleeping patients, their machines humming softly. Nothing unusual.

Then I reached Room 307.

Something about it made me pause.

The door wasn’t closed all the way. It was open just a crack, like someone had stepped in but never left. The dim light inside cast a sliver of a glow into the hallway.

I swallowed, hesitating.

Maybe someone forgot to close it properly. Maybe a doctor had just been in.

Or maybe… something else.

I stepped forward and peered inside.

A single bed. White sheets, slightly rumpled. The room smelled faintly of antiseptic, but there was another scent beneath it—something stale, something old.

An old man lay in the bed. His skin was gray, almost blending into the pillow beneath his head. His chest rose and fell in slow, shallow movements.

For a second, I thought he was asleep. But then—

His eyes snapped open.

I froze.

His gaze locked onto mine, wide and urgent. His lips parted, and when he spoke, his voice was dry, cracked, barely above a whisper.

“Water…”

I took a step forward.

“Please…” He pleaded again.

Instinct kicked in. He needed water. Of course, he did. His voice was hoarse, his throat dry. It was my job to help. I reached for the pitcher on the bedside table, my fingers brushing against the cool glass.

That’s when I saw her.

Nurse Alden.

She was already in the room.

I hadn’t heard her come in. I hadn’t seen her enter. She was just… there.

Standing beside the bed.

She rested Her hand gently on the old man’s forehead.

His entire body went rigid.

His breathing hitched, then stopped altogether. His lips, which had just been pleading for water, parted in a silent gasp. His fingers twitched once—just once—before falling still.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe.

Nurse Alden whispered something—words too soft for me to hear.

And then—

The old man let out a long, rattling sigh.

And just like that… he was gone.

The room was silent.

I took a shaky step back. “Did he—?”

Before I could finish, Nurse Alden turned to me. Her face was unreadable, her expression like stone.

She looked me dead in the eyes and said, “Keep walking.”

Something in her tone made my stomach clench.

I didn’t argue. I didn’t question.

I left the room, my legs moving before my brain could process what had just happened.

But as I reached the doorway, I hesitated. A sick, twisting curiosity made me glance back—just once.

The bed was empty. 

There—on the bed—

The dead man wasn’t there.

The sheets, which had just held a frail, dying man, were smooth. Unwrinkled.

As if no one had ever been there.

My heart pounded in my ears. I swallowed hard, trying to steady my breathing. Maybe I was imagining things. Maybe I was too tired. Maybe—

But when she left the room, I went in.

I checked his monitor.

No heartbeat. No breath.

His body had left life. He was gone.

And… There was nobody there.

That’s when I learned Rule #2.

If a patient in Room 307 asks for water, say no.

I was shaken. My hands trembled as I gripped the supply cart, pushing it down the hallway with stiff, robotic movements.

But I couldn’t leave. I still had hours left on my shift.

So I forced myself to focus.

Do the rounds. Keep moving. Act normal.

But then—

I saw something impossible.

At the far end of the hallway, near the dimly lit exit sign, someone was standing.

Someone facing me.

Someone wearing the same uniform.

Same posture.

Same tired stance.

Same face.

My face.

My breath caught in my throat.

It wasn’t a reflection. There was no mirror.

It was me.

It stood still, its head slightly tilted, as if just noticing me.

My legs felt like lead. My chest was tight.

Then—its mouth moved.

I couldn’t hear the words. But I knew it was speaking.

And it was speaking to me.

A cold, suffocating dread settled over me. My pulse hammered in my ears.

I wanted to move, to run, to do something—anything—but my body wouldn’t listen.

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw her.

Nurse Alden.

She was behind the desk now, half-hidden in the shadows.

She wasn’t looking at it.

She was looking at me.

Waiting.

I didn’t speak. I didn’t move.

And then—

The thing that looked like me slowly turned.

It walked toward the stairwell.

But the door didn’t open.

It just… went through.

I finally exhaled, my breath shaky and uneven.

That was when I learned Rule #3.

If you see yourself in the hallway, do not speak.

You might be wondering why I’m listing all these as rules.

I don’t blame you.

But I remember what happened when I was eight years old.

My mother used to work at this very hospital. She was a nurse, just like me. And sometimes, when she couldn’t find a sitter, she would bring me along for her night shifts.

I was too young to be afraid of hospitals back then. To me, they were just another place—quiet, full of beeping machines and the scent of antiseptic. A place where my mother worked, where people got better.

But there was one night I will never forget.

I had fallen asleep in one of the empty patient rooms.

It was small, with a single bed and an old, buzzing lamp that cast strange shadows on the wall. The sheets smelled like bleach, and the air was cold in a way that made my skin prickle. But I was a kid. I curled up under the stiff blanket and drifted off, listening to the distant hum of hospital equipment.

At first, everything was fine.

Then—

I felt it.

A breath against my ear.

A whisper.

Soft. Too soft to understand.

But it was there.

My eyes shot open, my heart pounding so hard it hurt.

The room was empty.

I sat up, my breath shaky, my little hands clutching the blanket. I wanted to call for my mother, but my throat was tight. I rubbed my eyes, trying to convince myself I was imagining things.

And then—

I looked toward the doorway.

And I froze.

There was a woman standing there.

Or at least, something that looked like a woman.

She was tall, her frame thin, almost stretched. Her hair was wild, tangled in thick knots that hung over her face. But it was her eyes that made my stomach twist.

They were hollow.

Dark.

Like something had scooped them out, leaving nothing but deep, empty pits.

She didn’t move. She just stared.

Then—

She smiled.

Her lips stretched too wide, her teeth yellow and jagged. The corners of her mouth kept going, stretching past where they should have stopped. And then—

She laughed.

Loud. Sharp. Wrong.

Not the kind of laugh that belonged to a person. Not amused, not joyful. It was something else.

Something broken.

I couldn’t breathe. My tiny fingers clutched the sheets so hard they ached.

I wanted to run. I wanted to scream.

And then—

She took a step forward.

I whimpered, scrambling backward until my back hit the cold wall.

I forced myself to speak, my voice barely more than a squeak. “M-Mom?”

The woman’s smile widened.

Her head tilted.

And then she whispered—

“You’re trapped.”

Tears burned my eyes. My body shook with silent sobs. I squeezed my eyes shut, praying for my mother to come.

Then—

The door handle rattled.

I gasped, my eyes flying open.

The woman was gone.

And standing in the doorway—

Was my mother.

I didn’t hesitate. I ran straight into her arms, crying so hard I couldn’t breathe.

She held me, stroking my hair, whispering that everything was okay.

When I finally calmed down enough to speak, I told her everything.

The whisper.

The woman.

The laughter.

Her eyes.

She listened patiently, nodding, letting me pour out my fear in rushed, breathless words.

And then—

She sighed.

She didn’t tell me it was my imagination. She didn’t laugh or brush it off.

She just pulled me closer and whispered, “It was just a nightmare.”

I wanted to believe her.

I tried to believe her.

But I knew the truth.

It wasn’t a nightmare.

It was real.

And now, years later, as I prepare for another night shift at this hospital, I can’t shake the feeling that she’s still here.

Waiting.

Watching.

So if you’re reading this—follow these rules.

Because I don’t know if I’ll make it through the night.

I needed a break.

I needed air.

My hands were shaking. My head felt light, like the walls around me were pressing in. The air in the hospital was always cold, always sterile, but tonight—it felt suffocating.

I just needed a moment to breathe.

So I headed toward the nurse’s station, hoping for a second to collect myself.

Then—

I heard it.

The elevator.

A soft ding echoed down the hall, cutting through the silence.

I stopped.

It was nearly 3 AM. No visitors. No late-night deliveries. No reason for anyone to be using the elevator.

But I still told myself it was nothing.

Maybe a doctor had finished paperwork. Maybe a janitor had pressed the wrong floor.

That’s what I told myself—until I saw the doors open.

And no one stepped out.

I felt my chest tighten.

The hallway was empty, stretching long and dim under the flickering lights. From where I stood, I had a clear view of the elevator, its metal doors yawning wide.

But there was nothing inside.

No doctor.

No visitor.

Just open doors and a dark, empty space.

I waited.

A few seconds passed.

The doors didn’t close.

That was wrong.

Hospital elevators had a timer. If no one stepped out or in, the doors should have shut by now. But they stayed open, like something was inside.

Like something was waiting.

I should have ignored it.

I should have walked away.

But then—

I heard it.

A faint shuffle.

A movement from inside.

Like something shifting. Something pressing against the walls.

I didn’t see anything—

Until the lights inside the elevator flickered.

And for just a fraction of a second, I saw them.

Hands.

Too many of them.

Pale fingers.

Gripping the walls.

The ceiling.

The floor.

Clinging, stretching, curling into the shadows like spiders.

And then—

The doors began to close.

I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding.

But just before they shut completely—

A hand shot out.

A hand that wasn’t attached to anything.

Pale skin, stretched thin over fragile bones. Fingers curling, twitching against the cold tile floor.

I heard the soft thump as it landed just outside the elevator.

Something inside me snapped.

I turned.

I walked away.

Fast.

I didn’t look back.

I didn’t stop until I reached the nurse’s station, my heart slamming against my ribs.

Then I saw her.

Nurse Alden.

Standing at the end of the hallway.

Watching.

Her expression was unreadable. But after a moment, she gave a small, slow nod.

Like she already knew.

Like she had seen this before.

That’s when I learned Rule #4.

If you hear the elevator ding but no one gets out, walk away.

By now, I wasn’t questioning things anymore.

I was past that.

There were rules. I had learned them. I had followed them. And as long as I kept following them, I would make it through the night.

That was all that mattered.

I just needed to finish my shift.

That was my only goal now.

But then—

I saw it.

A door.

At the end of the hallway.

I stopped cold.

I had walked this hallway a dozen times tonight. I knew every door, every turn, every flickering light.

But this door?

It wasn’t there before.

It was wrong.

It didn’t match the others. The color was slightly off—just enough to make my skin crawl. The handle looked too old, rusted, like it had been there for decades. The air around it felt heavy, like the hallway itself was holding its breath.

And the worst part?

It wasn’t on any floor plan.

I had seen the maps. I knew the layout. There was no room behind that door.

It didn’t belong.

I should have ignored it.

I wanted to ignore it.

But I couldn’t.

Something pulled at me, a quiet, invisible force that made my fingers twitch toward the handle. It wasn’t curiosity—it was need.

Like the door wanted to be opened.

Like it was waiting.

Then—

I heard a voice behind me.

"You don’t want to do that."

I jumped, spinning around so fast my breath caught in my throat.

Nurse Alden.

Standing there. Watching.

I swallowed hard, my mouth dry.

"What’s behind it?"

Her head tilted slightly.

Then, in that same unreadable tone, she said—

"You don’t want to know."

And the way she said it—

I believed her.

I let go of the handle.

I stepped back.

And I never looked at that door again.

That’s when I learned Rule #5.

If you find a door that wasn’t there before, do not open it.

At 6 AM, my shift was over.

I grabbed my things, keeping my head down, trying to shove everything out of my mind. The tapping on the window. The old man in Room 307. The elevator. The door.

I told myself it was over.

I made it.

But as I turned to leave, Nurse Alden appeared beside me.

"You should stay," she said.

My stomach twisted.

It wasn’t a question.

It wasn’t even a suggestion.

It was a test.

I gripped the strap of my bag, my knuckles white. The air around us felt heavy, thick. Like the walls were listening.

I shook my head. "I'm going home."

For the first time all night—

She smiled.

"Good."

And that was the worst part.

She looked pleased.

Not disappointed. Not annoyed. Pleased.

Like I had passed.

Her smile lingered as I turned toward the exit. I forced myself to keep walking, my feet moving faster than before.

But something made me look back.

Nurse Alden was still there, standing by the door, watching me.

Smiling.

I stepped outside.

The sun was rising, its soft golden light stretching across the empty parking lot. The air was cool and fresh, nothing like the stifling atmosphere inside.

I exhaled, relief washing over me.

Until I looked back at the hospital.

The windows were dark.

Too dark.

As if the building itself didn’t want to let the sunlight in.

And in the lobby, standing just beyond the glass doors—

Nurse Alden.

Watching.

Smiling.

I turned away quickly, heading for my car. The relief I’d felt was gone, replaced with a cold, creeping fear.

I had to leave.

I reached for my keys, my hands shaking—

Then I froze.

She was at the edge of the parking lot.

The same blank expression.

The same cold stare.

But now—

That empty smile was new.

I spun around.

She was by the emergency entrance.

I turned again.

She was by the ambulance bay.

Then—

The second-floor window.

Everywhere I looked—

There she was.

Too many of her.

Too. Many.

My breath hitched. My vision blurred. My fingers fumbled with the keys. I needed to get inside the car. Now.

I finally got the door open, jumped inside, and locked it.

My heart was slamming against my ribs, my breaths short and shallow. I gripped the steering wheel, forcing myself to look up—

And my blood ran cold.

She was standing right in front of my car now.

Just inches from the hood.

No movement.

No blinking.

Just watching.

Her lips moved.

I couldn’t hear her, but I didn’t need to.

I knew what she said.

"See you tomorrow."

That’s when I learned the last rule.

The life-saving rule.

If Nurse Alden asks you to stay, say no.

I slammed my foot on the gas pedal.

And I never looked back.
