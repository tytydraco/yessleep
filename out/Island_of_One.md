I don’t know why I’m writing this. There’s no one left to read it. Maybe I just need to see the words, to prove to myself that I’m still here—that I’m still me.

If you find this, leave. Don’t stay. Don’t listen. And whatever you do, don’t look at the water.

The island wasn’t always like this. I remember the market, the docks, the church bells ringing on Sundays. The children used to race barefoot down the sand-packed roads. We were small, but we were alive.

Then the gulls disappeared.

That was the first sign, though we didn’t know it at the time. At first, no one noticed. Then the fishermen started coming back with empty nets. The water was still, too still, like something beneath it had swallowed everything whole.

The insects went next. Then the goats. One morning, we woke up, and there were no sounds but the wind.

Then the people started changing.

It wasn’t a sickness, not really. No fevers, no coughs—just silence. The first ones to go were the ones who lived closest to the shore. I saw old Mr. Harlan standing in his front yard, staring at the ocean. He didn’t blink. Didn’t move. His mouth kept working, like he was whispering something to himself.

I asked him what was wrong. He turned his head just slightly, like he was listening to something I couldn’t hear.

And then he walked away.

Straight down the path. Past his gate, through the sand, into the waves. The tide rose up to his knees, then his waist, then his shoulders.

He didn’t struggle. Didn’t even look back.

And then he was gone.

We searched for him, but no one ever found his body.

That was the first one. The next day, there were three more. The day after that, seven. They all walked into the water the same way—slow, calm, as if answering a call only they could hear.

I tried to stop Mrs. Liao. She was my neighbor, always bringing me fresh bread. When I saw her standing at the shore, I ran to her. Grabbed her arm, shook her, screamed at her to wake up.

She turned to me then.

She looked like herself, but her eyes… her eyes were empty.

She whispered something. The wind stole the words before I could understand them. Then she smiled—just a small, quiet smile.

And she kept walking.

I stayed inside after that. Locked my doors. Boarded my windows. I stopped answering when people knocked. At night, I heard footsteps outside—soft, careful. Pausing just beneath my window.

I stopped looking.

Then the knocking stopped. The voices stopped. The whole island went silent.

For days, I didn’t leave my house. I lived on old bread and dried fruit. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw them—the way they walked, the way the sea swallowed them whole.

When I finally worked up the courage to go outside, I found the streets empty. Shops stood open, doors swaying in the wind. The boats were still tied at the docks, rocking gently in the tide.

But there was no one left.

Just me.

I thought maybe I was safe. That whatever had taken them had missed me. I should have known better.

The first night alone, I woke up in my doorway. The door was open, wind rushing in, my bare feet wet with seawater. I didn’t remember getting up.

The second night, I woke up standing on the path leading to the shore.

Last night, I woke up with my toes touching the tide.

Something is calling me. I hear it when I sleep. A soft whisper, curling around the edges of my dreams. I think I know now what they heard.

I don’t know how much longer I can fight it.

If you find this, please—don’t listen.

Don’t look at the water.

And if you see me walking toward the sea, don’t try to stop me.
