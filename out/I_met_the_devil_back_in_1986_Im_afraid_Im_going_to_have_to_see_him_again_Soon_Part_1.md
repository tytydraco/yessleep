I was eighteen when he came to me, scritch-scratching on the windowpane of my bedroom on the second floor of our house on York Street in the dead of night. I had to answer for what I'd done, to settle up for my wicked deed.

When I'd met him the day before and traded him my soul, I thought that ended it. But there’s no even-Stephen or all-square. You're never settled up, not with him.

\*\*\*

It was 1986, and I'd been out hunting with Eddie Volin. Eddie was driving deer toward me, down off Morrison Hill, which is where the big bruisers holed up in the dense poplar growth when they took a break from chasing does during the rut when the moon was full.

Eddie had flushed a corker - two sixty if he was a pound, at least that's how I remember it. But memory is a funny thing that way, isn't it? You think things are bigger than they were, and when you revisit them, with the benefit of years, they seem impossibly smaller. The acres of your front yard were nothing but a twelve-foot patch of crabgrass from the curb to the porch.

I had seen the big bastard coming and lifted my father's old .30-06 to my shoulder and fired, and it struck flesh, but it wasn't the twelve-pointer. The bullet sliced through Eddie's neck, and he coughed, choked, and wheezed as his blood spilled out onto the dying foliage beneath his body.

I had seen the buck in my scope. I was sure of it. But when I lowered my rifle, he was gone. I wrestle with that all these years later. What I can tell you for certain is this – I saw it. Whether it was there is an entirely different matter.

I ambled toward Eddie, too shocked to cry. I heard blood gurgling in his throat as he coughed out his last breaths.

"It's okay," a voice said, and at first, I thought it was Eddie. But the voice was placid, with a distance that sounded like it was talking to me through a thin wall, a couple of prisoners whispering so the guards couldn't hear.

I turned to find who or what the voice had come from, and it was a man seated on a log. His hair was white and slicked back with something as oily as the smile on his lips. He wasn't old because there wasn't a wrinkle on his skin.

It was as if a surgical glove had been stretched over his head and vacuum sealed. The corners of his eyes and mouth appeared like invisible fingers were pulling them back. He wore a white apron over a flannel shirt and drab pants, and the apron was covered with blood splatters.

I asked him who he was, and he said, "You may call me Ulric," which seemed an oddly formal way to put it.

"I live 'round here and make my living from the woods, just as your daddy and his daddy and his daddy did," he said.

He took a piece of leather from an apron pocket and unfolded it. On it sat a plethora of sharp, rusted, and medieval-looking tools. I felt myself tense, but I didn't want to step back and betray my fear.

Instead, I looked at Eddie, who had ceased making any noise, though I thought I could still faintly hear that gurgling sound.

"I'm a taxidermist, and I cut 'em for a double sawbuck, a good old Andrew Jackson that's right, but that ain't the real price, no no no, no-siree, the price I charge…" he trailed off, then, lowering his voice conspiratorially a bit, "the price I charge it's not in money, you understand my meaning, dontcha, boy?"

I nodded slowly and licked my lips, but there wasn't a drop of saliva in my mouth to moisten them.

He took two short knives with hooked ends and scraped them together, creating a piercing, high-pitched sound. His eyes were a milky blue as if clouded by cataracts.

"Now I'll slice and dice, and I'll throw his soul in," he said, cackling again, only louder this time. He said it to the cadence of the Big Bad Wolf, issuing his warning to the Three Little Pigs.

He rocketed violently up off the log to his feet, then was in front of me, sticking the tip of one of the knives into the blaze orange of my hunting vest.

"We got ourselves a deal, bucko?" he asked, and I could see the clouds in his eyes swirl like the animation of a winter storm on the six o'clock news.

I nodded, then he reached into the pocket of his apron and, pulled out a pair of rusty crucible tongs and lifted them toward my nose, and I did my best not to flinch.

I felt them poke into one of my nostrils and wasn't sure they would fit, but Ulric didn't seem to have a problem stuffing them up there. It took some probing, but he started to pull at something, and out it came.

Pinched between the end of the tongs was a carrion beetle, the kind of bug that feeds on the flesh of the dead. He took it between his gnarled fingers, popped it into his mouth, and chewed.

“Oooh, that’s a smoky one, coal-fired, oh you bet,” he said.

I could taste it, too, and it was like eating sulfur. I saw yellowed teeth as he chomped on it and heard its thorax crunching.

He walked over to the body and knelt, lowering his mouth until it was close to Eddie's. He parted his lips, and I saw the beetle crawl between them and into Eddie's mouth.

Eddie's skin began to rise and fall as if something were alive inside of him. Beetles, hundreds, thousands, began to devour him from inside out, poking their heads out of his flesh, and soon there was nothing left.

His body was gone. The only thing that remained was the mushroomed round I'd fired into him.

I turned to look for Ulric, but he was gone too. I scooped up what remained of the bullet, then backtracked to find my shell casing. Then I went home, and when I got there, I went to my room, fell facedown into the pillow, and cried for Eddie and what I'd done.

\*\*\*

Eddie would often hunt by himself, and it was just as likely that he'd been out there alone as it was that he was hunting with me. And wouldn't it be like some Masshole up here looking to get a real deer and not one of those jackrabbit-sized bucks they have down south to shoot a local and leave him for dead?

When the tears were spent, I went to Eddie's house with the rifle slung over my shoulder. I knocked on the front door, and Mr. Volin answered. I asked if Eddie might like to go out looking for a deer

before dark came, and Mr. Volin said he'd already trudged out the backdoor with his .22 shortly before legal shooting hours.

He hadn't seen hide nor hair of him since, and maybe he'd managed to get himself a buck and was having trouble dragging it out. I thanked him and went home, and my father's beef stew didn't go down easy.

He was home because the mill was on strike that fall and had started cooking since my mother had taken the cancer and died that spring. *Taken it.* That’s how my grandmother used to say it before it took her. As if it were a conscious choice, like plucking something off the shelf at Aubuchon's Hardware.

At the table, my father looked at me with suspicious curiosity. He could smell it on me, I thought. So I excused myself and went back to my room.

I crawled into bed, stared out the window across the river, and saw the stacks of the paper mill belching out their plumes, the tallest of them with a blinking red cyclops eye, shrouded in smoke from the shorter ones.

I heard the hollow, rapid thumps of logs falling off a conveyor into an empty metal hopper without a discernible pattern, pounding rapidly like an irregular heartbeat. And when the ten o'clock whistle blew at the fire station, I was still awake. It sounded like the bleat of a foghorn from a ship in dense fog.

My great-grandfather had come over before the Great War, as the old folks called it, and at first, had worked the log runs when the town was something out of the Old West. Gunfights and saloons, stabbings, brothels on every corner. When the paper mill opened, more immigrants came. Acadians from Canada, the Lithuanians, the Irish, and the Italians.

When he got home from the Pacific with a mangled leg and a 50% disability, my grandfather got a job on the number ten paper machine. When my father got back from the Ia Drang in '66, with no external wounds but plenty on the inside, he went in, too.

I had a legacy, and it was twelve bucks an hour, time-and-a-half on weekends.

\*\*\*

The scritch scratch scritch scratch at the window in the middle of the night woke me, the hooked end of the knife moving across the pane, beckoning me to make a decision.

"Are you gonna play keepsies, my boy? Or will you passiton?" he asked, the words merging together.

Passiton.

It replayed in my mind.

Passiton.

I understood what the bargain was now. Oh, I traded my soul, but it didn't end there. Would I keep the evil he’d given me? Or would I passiton?

Because that's how it works. Evil deeds beget evil deeds, and so on, and so forth, up and down, and back and forth through the ages. We swallow it and let it consume us. Or we passiton.

As I pressed my pillow over my ears to drown out that sound, I thought back to a Bible verse I remembered from school about Jesus being tempted by the devil. It was from Matthew. I knew that only because that was my name.

I mouthed the words silently to myself:

Away from me, Satan.

\*\*\*

When Eddie hadn't returned that night, Mr. Volin called the sheriff, and in the morning, the game wardens brought a dog in, and a search party of locals was formed. Since the mill was on strike, plenty of men were out searching the woods.

I joined because he was my friend, even though I knew they'd never find him. This went on for days and then a week, the missing posters yellowing on telephone poles, but eventually, people lost interest. The kids at school stopped talking about him. The general consensus was that he'd been taken by the Man In The Blue Van. You know what I'm talking about if you spent time in the 80’s.

And each night, there was that sound at my window, his voice hissing at me. "What'll it be, boy? Are you gonna keep it all for yourself like a good little piggy? Or are you going to send it along?"

The week before Thanksgiving, I felt myself growing weaker. A few days after that, I couldn't get out of bed. I hoped it was just crushing guilt, but deep down, I knew better.

My father barely noticed what was happening because he spent most days on the picket line at the lower gate of the mill and his nights on a barstool at the Silvertone, which he and his buddies had unofficially dubbed "Strike Headquarters." Wink wink.

The night the vomiting started, I mustered as much strength as possible to get downstairs and try to eat something, Saltines at least, anything to settle my stomach. I was maneuvering around the kitchen table when I saw the Sun Journal unfolded to the local section, and a headline caught my eye.

For the first time since I squeezed the trigger, I felt a jolt of something. Hope, or maybe it was inspiration, or maybe even desperation.

Instead of heading for the cabinet, I pulled on my parka and boots. I grabbed a flashlight and shuffled into the woods behind the house, up toward Morrison Hill.

He was sitting there waiting for me, his apron fresh with blood.

"I didn't have you made for a passer, no-siree, no, no, no, I sure didn't. Thought you were like your mother, I sure did, you bet," and he cackled that cackle.

My mother. He saw the look on my face and smiled, revealing those yellowed teeth. "You remember Charlie Ginoux, don't ya?" he asked.

Of course. He was a local guy who shuffled around town with a cane. He had a limp. Kids would whisper it was because he'd been taken prisoner in Korea and the Chinese had sliced his Achilles.

My father assured me that the closest Charlie Ginoux had ever been to China was face down in a pupu platter from the Far East, #15 substitute fingers for wings.

Charlie had been out walking, as he always was. It must have been eighteen months now. He'd been struck by a car out on Route 2 late at night. Charlie didn't drive, which was probably a good thing for all concerned. But he had been hit and left for dead.

"Your father never told you, did he? He probably figured you couldn't handle the truth that your mother liked the bottle more than she liked just about anything else, including you. And she thought it might be a good idea to go slaloming home through those notches up past Three Pools. Maybe she was headed out to get her pussy filled up by Jake McDonald, a little sucky sucky action. She liked that on the side, she sure did – "

"Fuck you!" I shrieked, cutting him off. "That's fucking bullshit."

He stuck the hooked end of his knife between his front teeth as if trying to dislodge a piece of meat.

"You know it isn't. Why didn't she bother to have the treatments if she had cancer? Why did she lock herself up in the attic and wither into nothing, turning away all visitors?"

I didn't want to believe any of this, but I knew it was true. He was a Master of Lies, but maybe they aren't lies. Sometimes, they are the things we can't face.

He saw that I was starting to accept this and nodded approvingly.

"Your daddy begged her to pass it. He threw himself on the floor and begged her. He even begged for her to pass it to him. But she wouldn't. She was strong…and you?"

I swallowed, mustering my courage. Though it wasn't courage, was it? It was merely girding myself to face my own cowardice for what I was about to do.

"I want to pass it on," I said.

\*\*\*

After telling him I wanted to pass it, I felt better. I didn't feel like puking. My color looked better when I saw my face in the mirror, and my strength had returned. A burden had been lifted.

You may not believe this next part, but it's there for you to look up in the papers. Given the last decade or so of our great American experiment, I suppose it's a bit more believable.

But that was the month that the Klan came to town. That's right, the KKK. This wasn't some segregated town in Mississippi or Alabama. Sure, there was the casual racism tossed around. While that's a distinction without a difference, the Grand State of Maine has always been a bit more progressive, at least in my biased view.

I'm not saying it was all Kumbaya. There was a big Klan presence here around the time all those immigrants started to arrive. But now? The racists mostly kept it to themselves, lest they be called impolite.

But the Klan at the time was struggling to stay relevant, and any port in a storm, they figured. And believe me, there was a storm. The strike was ugly. Civil War shit, brothers against brother, union against salaried, union against scabs. The bars (and we had the most bars per capita of any town in the northeast. You can look that one up, too) were a bucket of blood. Most places stopped serving bottles and pint glasses and went to plastic cups.

Again, don't take my word for this. Look it up in the back issues of the Sun. You'll find accounts of shotguns fired through pickup truck windows and Molotov cocktails tossed on front porches. Ugly stuff.

And if there's one thing the Klan likes to prey on, it's divisiveness. "Othering" is another thing my daughter has taught me about, and the Klan was pretty good at exploiting that. There was a lot of othering going around during the strike.

But when the Klan came, people pulled together. They lined up on Congress Street and watched them march through town, and everybody crowded the sidewalks to tell them they weren't welcome.

Sure, they had about a dozen or so locals join up with them to march, but that was it. The rest of the people jeered them. Booed them. Spit at them. Some threw rocks. Now, I'm not saying that was the right thing to do – but sometimes it's the only thing you can do.

I wasn't there, though, to see that. I had to watch it on the news and read about it in the papers. Because I was out at the Cote farm, and I was waiting.

The article on the kitchen table made me realize that maybe, just maybe, it would be okay if I could pass this thing on to someone who deserved it. Someone who had it coming.

Now given what I'd done to poor Eddie – and again, I'll throw myself at the mercy of the court and plead that there was a Goddamn monster buck in that scope – that Grand Dragon Homer Harlon Graves by way of Springdale, Arkansas had it coming a lot worse than I did.

This guy was old enough to have been in some real shit. You don't rise up the ranks of the Klan in the Deep South in the 50's and 60's because you're compassionate. No, sir, you need a few lynchings notched in the old belt. At least, that's what I told myself.

\*\*\*

The night before, I had got in my beat-to-shit Nissan pickup and drove out to the only motel in town, the Purple Iris. I knew that's where they'd be staying.

I sat in the shadows with the rifle across my lap and waited. I wouldn't need it, but I had it along just in case. Shortly after ten o'clock, a caravan of trucks pulled into the lot. I slid down in the seat and peered over the dash.

I tried to make out their faces in the lights outside each room but couldn't. Then the driver's side door of a big old Ford swung open, and a hulking giant of a man got out.

That was him. I recognized him from the pictures in the paper and how he towered over the others. I saw the reflection from the lights off his bald head, which confirmed it.

I watched him shuffle toward the main office, hauling a duffel bag. I felt my fingers run along the smooth, oiled barrel of my grandfather's gun. Felt the urge to jump out of the cab and take him down right there.

But that wouldn't work. That's not how any of this worked. I couldn't do that. I had to pass it on.

\*\*\*

My sleep was light and fitful, though there was no scritch scratching at the window. I woke at 8:00, slinking past my father's bedroom. Heard him snoring, sleeping off the beers from Strike Headquarters.

I didn't eat, knew I couldn't keep anything down, and wanted to be sure I was out of the house before my old man was awake.

I grabbed a Moxie from the fridge and went to the truck. I took my backpack from the closet on the sun porch. I had packed it the night before, and it had everything I would need. The canoe was in the bed of the truck.

The truck started hard as it always did. I drove through town with the sun cresting the mountains, unsure where I was going. The temperature was in the forties, and a heavy mist rose from the river, where it met the smoke from the mill stacks.

I decided to pull into the church parking lot next to the rectory. I listened to 102.9 out of Portland, the "rock and roll blimp," as they were called.

Smoke rose from the chimney at the rectory, and I realized why I had decided to park here. It was an unconscious need to absolve myself. I had been pretty lapsed since I went to the public high school and stopped attending Mass entirely after my mother passed.

But still. Old habits die hard, and you can never wash off any of that ingrained Catholic guilt. So I took a deep breath and got out of the truck.

\*\*\*

I sat across from Father Richard in the living room of the rectory, a fire crackling on the hearth. He sat with his legs crossed, wearing a black sweater, his white collar poking up around his neck.

"Now, what did you want to see me about, Matthew?" he asked.

He was a good shit. My lack of attendance at church never had anything to do with him. He was older, wasn't above cursing – though he never took the Lord's name in vain – and famously liked to have a belt or four after dinner. And there were never any whispers about him the way there were about other priests.

I told him that I would like to make a confession. He nodded and asked how long it had been, and I wrinkled my nose, trying to remember. I lied and said a couple of years, though I am sure it had been at least five when I went to the parish school.

He looked at me, eyeing how my hands fidgeted in my lap. I asked him if someone, not me, confessed something to him that was criminal – was he required to report that to the police.

He flattened his mouth and inhaled through his nose, figuring that this wasn't a generic question and that I was the criminal in question.

He sighed. "I'm explicitly forbidden from reporting anything I hear in a confessional. I would, however, encourage the party to turn his – or herself – into the authorities."

I nodded slowly and committed to myself that after I did what was needed, I would turn myself in and admit what I'd done. That was a grand lie of self-delusion. I realize that now.

"I'd like to make my confession," I said.

Father Richard nodded and stood up, motioning for me to follow him to the front room, where there was a confessional booth. As we were walking down the hall, the doorbell rang.

From around the corner, a voice squawked out, "DING DONG." That was Rudy. Father Richard famously had an African grey parrot that had a vocabulary of over eight hundred words and phrases.

When we were back in school and a message needed to be brought over to the rectory, we would fight over who got to do it because that meant being able to whisper "Fuck you, Rudy" to the bird, to which he would return a, "Fuck you, boy" to us.

Father opened the door as I stood behind him. I nodded to Rudy, who was in his cage, but his attention was on the door.

Standing on the porch was a bald, hulking man in a leather jacket. The jacket was covered with patches that played all the greatest hits. 1488. SS. Nazi skulls with lightning bolts. It was Homer Harlon Graves in the flesh.

He smiled at Father Richard; the old priest balled up his fists, and his body shook.

I learned later that this was part and parcel of how these guys operated. They'd go into a town and

provoke. They wanted attention, and the only way they got it was by working people up into a furor.

With Father Richard, it worked. He started to sweat. "You…you…" His breaths quickened, and he jabbed his finger toward Graves.

"You…you…you get the fuck out of my rectory," he wheezed.

With this, he collapsed, grabbing at his chest. I was stunned for a moment, then went to him as Graves let the storm door close. I lifted my eyes from Father Richard and saw Graves through the glass, his eyes staring down at me.

The look was the same that I had seen in the eyes of Ulric, the devil in the woods.

After I called the ambulance, I sat there on the floor, stroking Father Richard's hair, telling him the lie that he was going to be okay.

As I waited, Rudy squawked out over and over, "Get the fuck out of my rectory, get the fuck out of my rectory."

\*\*\*

The ambulance came and took Father Richard to the hospital. It was a widowmaker, and he never regained consciousness. I never did confess.

I reasoned that was the universe's way of telling me I didn't need to confess my sins. If you break it down, that's some pretty fucked up logic. Father Richard croaked, so you don't have to admit the horrible thing you did.

Pretty messed up, right? But that's what guilt will do to you. The excuses you create in your mind are limitless and unending.

I thought I should maybe go up to the hospital, but one of the paramedics who knew my older brother Dennis shook his head at me, and I got the message – he wasn't going to make it.

I looked at my watch and decided that I should get going even though it was early. I drove out of town and past the falls, whitewater cascading down through the granite gorge. At the top of the hill, I took a left and headed down the South Abbot Mills road, the blacktop snaking along the winding river.

Five miles out, I pulled the truck over and parked it on the soft shoulder. I got out and listened. I couldn't hear anything save for the wind rustling fallen leaves. When I was sure a car wasn't coming, I hauled my father's Old Town canoe out of the truck bed and dragged it into the thick underbrush.

I slung my backpack over my shoulder and grabbed the tip of the canoe with both hands. I used my back to break through the brambles, the boat easily sliding down the slope toward the river. Prickly vines jumped up and caught on my flannel shirt, but my forward progress would rip them off when I backed up with sufficient force.

I finally broke through, and the river was there. It was calm here, right on a big, almost hairpin bend, five miles above the dam and falls. It was a good three hundred yards across. I squinted at the gently sloping fields on the other side and saw a big red barn with the words COTE DAIRY on its side.

I looked upriver and then down. I wasn't sure what I expected – the last river barge had come through about forty years ago. The coast was clear, and I slid the canoe into the water and reached for the paddle that was slid beneath the bow seat.

I stepped in.

\*\*\*

I was across the river by noon, the canoe hidden safely in some bushes. I crawled on my belly up the bank with the paddle in my hand. At the top, I parted the waist-high grass in Gerry Cote's back forty. It was quiet.

I assumed Gerry and his family were down in town. I wasn't sure if they were partaking in the parade through town or if they were just observing. Either way, he was the one who had invited them here, and they would have their little celebration here on his land.

I slunk back into the bushes and rolled over onto my back. The sun was warm for November, and I watched cotton ball clouds float past. Even with what I'd seen at the rectory and what lay ahead, I was relaxed. I closed my eyes, and I dreamed.

I was back in the attic. Back where my mother was, where she stayed in those final months, away from us as the disease ate her alive. It wasn't the cancer. I knew that now. It was something far worse.

Years later, when I heard the old North Carolina State coach Jim Valvano deliver what amounted to a deathbed speech at the ESPY Awards, I was struck by his words. He said, "Cancer can take away all of my physical abilities. It cannot touch my mind, it cannot touch my heart, and it cannot touch my soul."

That might have been true. But this thing. The thing that I had to pass on, the thing that my mother refused to give to someone else – it took all of those things. It inhaled and devoured them, and it chewed them up.

In my dream – and it wasn't a dream, it was more like a home movie. Because it wasn't something my subconscious came up with. It was what actually happened on that day.

My father had told me I should go up because it was getting close to the end. I stepped into the attic. I saw her body there, gaunt and skeletal, her eyes sunken. She smiled, and I could see the ligaments in her jaw constrict beneath her tracing paper-thin skin.

She looked at me, and I wasn't sure if she knew who I was. I ducked my head so I wouldn't bonk it on the rafters. "Well, aren't you a big cocksucker," she hissed at me and laughed. But it wasn't her laugh. It was the laugh from the woods.

I looked at her and saw a bony foot protruding out from the bedsheet. I lifted the sheet to cover her toes, but the bedsores stuck to the sheet. I shuddered, then heard a ca-chunk. I lowered my head and saw a chain.

I followed the links with my hand, and under the sheet, it led to a shackle around her ankle. The skin beneath it had worn away to reveal bone.

"Do me a favor while you're down there?" she said with a cackle. I lifted the sheet, pulling despite the bed sores sticking to it, and saw that she was shackled on both ankles and wrists.

I slowly moved my gaze to her face, and when our eyes met, she violently flung herself upward with an unimaginable force that drew the chains taught, straining at the bolts in the floor they were secured to.

I screamed.

When this happened, I had run from the attic and never saw her again. She had died the next day. But now, my eyes snapped open and I was staring into the inky darkness of late fall dusk, the first stars beginning to wink into view.

My heart felt like it would tear out of my chest, and I gasped for air. When I had calmed down - not much, but enough to function - I looked at the Casio on my wrist and pushed the button that illuminated its face. 5:48.

It didn't seem possible I was out for that long, but...

I listened and heard voices. I rolled onto my stomach and crawled on my belly to the edge of the waist- high grass, where it gave way to the mowed field.

There were two dozen of them, and they were wearing their robes. They had on those conical hats that would be comedic did they not represent incarnate evil. The hoods with the eyeholes that covered their faces weren't pulled over their heads yet.

I saw about fifteen people watching the Klansmen as they prepared a cross propped up on one of its horizontal ends. They were wrapping it in burlap and dousing it with lighter fluid.

I slunk back undercover a bit because I had a little time. I unzipped my backpack and took out the mini flashlight inside. I clicked it on and held it between my teeth. Inside, I saw the folded white of the bedsheet. I realized that the sheets had probably covered my mother in the attic.

This hit me in the gut, but I didn't have time to wallow because there was a noise behind me. Hushed whispers, grass being trampled. I rolled over onto my back, taking the flashlight from my mouth. Before I could shut it off, the beam went straight up and caught a flash of something - someone.

It was Jesse.

He froze, and I realized he couldn't see me with the light in his eyes, so I clicked it off, "It's me, it's me," I said, trying to keep as quiet as possible.

I could hear him exhale. He crouched and came to where I was lying, carrying a duffel bag.

"We snuck in by the road and cut a hole in the barbed wire fence. There's a hundred people out there protesting, and cops and everything."

I nodded. "You got the stuff?"

He unzipped his bag, and inside, there were cherry bombs, packs of M80s, and two slingshots. "Twenty- five bucks worth; that's all my paper delivery money."

"I'll pay you back, don't worry," I said, but Jesse didn't seem concerned.

“Kyle Arsenault's went around on the other side of the field directly across from us, and Gerry's over there somewhere," he jerked his thumb toward the south side toward the road.

I was the one who had gently suggested all of this, so you would think it was my show. But the guys had taken it and run with it. I'd told them I was going to get there early and "do some recon," and in their excitement, no one probed too deeply on that front.

Did I feel a touch guilty? You bet your ass. You'd have to be an asshole not to. I had got my three friends together and told them we would launch a sneak attack on the Klan's cross burning. Now, I didn't tell them what my own selfish motivation for this was.

But I reasoned – which is code for "lied to myself so I'd feel less guilty" - that the guys wouldn't have a problem with a bit of rabble-rousing in the form of launching fireworks at the fucking Invisible Empire. None of them were as fired up for this as Jesse, considering…well, considering that he was the only black kid in high school.

As I sat there assessing my guilt, Jesse's eyes fell on my unzipped bag. He saw the white cloth protruding from inside.

"Matty..." He stood up. "No man, I swear -"

"What the fuck, man?" he said.

"Jesse, I promise -"

He looked into my eyes and saw the fear in them. He touched his fingers on the starched bedsheet, then pulled them back as if merely feeling them was enough to burn the flesh from his fingers.

"What's the deal, man?" he said.

I didn't have a good explanation, so I settled on the truth.

\*\*\*
