I'm an ex-criminal so is my wife. I'm originally from a country with a really bad crime rate and lots of police corruption. My former boss was as bad as they come and I did some illegal shit for him because I looked up to him. He was like a father to me and a lot of others. Mostly I just collected debts and kept girls at the brothel in line. That's how I met my wife she was like the other girls at first foreign, unable to speak the native language, I thought she'd disappear like so many others in a few months but unlike most was smart knew how to adapt.

Within about six months she was fluent and a year after that the old madame was dead and she got the job. Two years after that we became parents but not in the usual way. The boss killed one of the girls I heard about that happening but first time I saw it well heard it. My boss told me to wait outside and thirty minutes later I hear screaming.

Another guy and I went in and saw the body and the boss covered in blood. We soon found a little kid no older than maybe 3 or 4. She was hiding in a closet and the boss wanted her dead I convinced him not to said she'd forget everything even her mom when she got older.

He put a gun to my head and asked if I'd take responsibility should he end up regretting letting her live. I told him I would. He took a minute to decide and said I better keep the girl on a tight leash.

I brought the girl home with me to my wife then girlfriend. My Wife was not happy about it she was never good at showing compassion or looking out for anyone not herself. In hindsight I think she only got with me as a form of protection or something. I convinced her to go along with it I told her if she couldn't love the kid just treat her like the girls at the brothel and put on an act.

The little girl didn't speak for the longest time. I think she was so traumatized she blocked everything out. She just started acting like we were her parents out of the blue, I didn't know her name so I named her after her mom, her mom's work name anyway. 

A year later things were going well my wife and I were married. Then my gang gets hit the boss died and the girls were all slaughtered. We got lucky because we were with the kid and not important enough to get hunted down. Still I told talked my wife into leaving the country with me I didn't want to take chances since that's how lots of people end up dead.

So we took the kid, and I took some money I knew had been stashed. Then we started over in the U.S. As far as anyone else knows we're just a young couple with a kid.
