If I would have known that this second phase existed, I would never have taken part in the survey. 


I guess that’s why they don’t tell you about it. 


I was right, I won’t keep you waiting.


I was looking at the survey that I had taken, complete with the answers that I had given. 


The final question, the fourth question had been highlighted in that terrible yellow and the text had been set to bold.


I looked back to the roses, my brain was so scattered I felt like I just zigzagged around my kitchen all night, but I knew I needed to find the note that the delivery girl mentioned. 


An easy find. I made my way back over to the roses and held them to inspect, but a small rolled up note untucked itself and fell to the table.


Hands shaking, I took a breather before I looked at the note, it was just two lines long. I steadied my hands.


*“One out of three”*, in neat handwritten ink pen was the first line, talk is cheap, lies are expensive.” was the second.


*One out of three, talk is cheap, lies are expensive.*


My head pulsing, the jigsaw coming into clear view as opened my laptop and typed the website address in. Again, immediate redirection to the google document where I went straight to entering the password.


*1993*, I was in. 


My vision wobbled, locking in on the yellow part of the survey. The fourth and final question. 


It read: *“if an intruder were to enter your home without your consent and threaten your life, if necessary, would you use deadly force to prevent them ending your life?”*


I had answered **yes**, which had set in stone just below the question, definitely one of the most regrettable tickbox decisions I have ever made. 


The lady at the coffee shop, the man-on-the-highway, Ryan and Katie. They were questions one through three. 


The self defense one was the only question left. 


Question four. 


Killing a murderous intruder is the last‘hypothetical’ situation posed from by survey. The only one that had not yet been realised in some way. But if we had completed three of the ‘questions’, why did I only get ‘one out of three’?


It hit me.


*Flash.*


I had been tested .


I had lived up to my word on only *one* of the questions. 


I had said that I *would* help someone on the side of the road.


I had said that I *wouldn’t* help anyone cover up a bad deed..


 I had said that I *would* try and reunite a person with their lost valuables.


Only one of those has been demonstrably true. 


Three times, my word had been tested. Twice, it failed.


The google document. *Focus*. 


I studied the questions again to see if there were any clues hidden in this version, anything that could help me make this all just *stop.*


The wording on every question read exactly the same as the first time I’d seen it on Reddit. Word for word. 


I studied the page I noticed one very big difference between this document and the one I saw the first time around. Page two. 


The first document only had one page which was identical to page one of this new document. 


I’m certain that the document only had one page the first time, I remember it vividly — it struck me as someone who has written these kinds of research questionnaires before that this one was *so* short, *so* brief. 


It opened with a short paragraph at the top thanking the participant and asking for full honesty in exchange for their anonymity.


Underneath the introduction, the four questions were listed just as I have phrased them here with a small space under each that held two tick boxes — one for **yes,** one for **no**. 


It finished with a fleeting expression of thanks for the honesty and the time taken to complete. That was it. 


It’s not uncommon for research surveys to be upwards of eight or nine pages, with one or two often dedicated just to explaining the aims of the research and explaining any rules. 


This one page-er was such an anomaly that I actually went to look for any missing pages and skim the post I’d found it on where multiple comments mentioned “wishing all surveys were this short!” — I was reassured.


I didn’t think about it. 


I just thought I’d complete the survey and be glad that I could pat myself on the back for taking thirty seconds to help someone with their project. 


I hovered my mouse over the second page and I took a deep breath, as I exhaled, I clicked. I closed my eyes. 


Another inhale, *1, 2, 3.*


Eyes open. 


*Flash.*


*”Thank you for your participation in part one of our survey.* 


*The purpose of this survey is to provide some data to support or challenge some of the ideas and conclusions we come to around a number of topics including;*
*Participant’s perception of self and how that may influence own grasp on the reality of the self,* 
*Honesty and how the participant chooses where and when it is appropriate to be dishonest.*
*Participant’s motivation to appear righteous over authentic, even when offered anonymity and absence of consequence.*
*Other topics may also be explored given the psychological applications that this research has potential toward.*


*”A small number of participants may be subjected to the second phase of the study which includes an exercise in which the participant is asked to* *re-assess and if necessary revise their answers after a series of practical exercises.”*


Practical exercises? 


*Practical exercises.* 


The jigsaw, complete. 


I knew that all of the pieces were right in front of me; lined up all nice on the table in the form of flowers and a business card, glittered by the white glow of my laptop. Everything was right here, in perfect order.


But, the jigsaw was somewhere in my far-off peripheral vision and I just could not see it clearly. No matter how much I tried to see, it remained distorted. 


Until it didn’t. 


It all snapped into view.


*Flash.*


My far off, distorted perception now central and clear. 


The research wasn’t focused on the answers that I had given on the survey. 


They didn’t care which way I swayed when it came to big moral decisions, I could have answered either way and it wouldn’t have mattered. 

What matters to these people, is whether I am being honest. 


If my *actions* match my *answers.*


They want to know if my dishonesty is a product of an attempt to deceive *them*, or if I am deceiving *myself*.


I had been chosen for the second phase and I had failed two of the three tests that had been posed to me so far. 


My brain was grating, had these researchers been responsible for my flat tyre? Had they made sure I’d be late for work— heightening the stakes for when I found the highway man?


Had someone been on a mission to appeal to my brother’s wandering eye? 


When I finally looked at the group chat, the boys had met up after work at a local bar to push happy hour to its limit. I was supposed to go, but it hadn’t even entered my head. 


After work, all I could think about was the business card in my jacket pocket.


A few of the boys sent ‘wish you were here’ type photos at the happy hour, followed by some ‘you’re missing out, dude’ type photos at a strip clip an hour and a half later —
two starring Ryan.


I checked the times, my brother called to warn me about Katie’s call 25 minutes after the ‘look at us, we’re at a strip club’ selfies. One could say he is quickly persuaded.


Had someone that I know had something to do with this? Someone must know an awful lot about me to have facilitated all of these tests.


Yet, I never even gave my name. 


I shifted my focus to the more immediate problem that illuminated my table through my laptop screen. I could figure *‘who’* ,*’why’* and *’how’* out later, right now I needed *‘what’* and *‘when’*, ideally.


The second survey. The laptop.
There specifically, the part of the survey that had been highlighted in obnoxious yellow. 


The fourth question and my answer to it. 


The fourth question presumably still awaited its exercise and the clue from the question — given what I know about the first three, tells me that if there was a practical exercise, it was a threat. 


To my life. In my home.


I know that they know where I live, the flower delivery girl knew my address and I’m sure she’s not the only one, they obviously know far more than I do. 


There’s just one test left.
