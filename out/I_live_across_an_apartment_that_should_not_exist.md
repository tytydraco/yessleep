I live in a one bedroom apartment in the part of the city where workers live, there are maybe a 100,000 in the area so it gets a little congested sometimes. My apartment is on the quieter side of that because my windows look out to more apartments and not the busy shopping district. I would look out at the other apartments and see what normal people do when they are home. The apartments across range from 2 to 3 rooms per apartment and its for the higher earners.

I work as an assembly factory worker so my daily task is picking this thing up and placing into a bigger thing and on and on, needless to say it’s the most tedious job in existence. In this city no matter how educated you are there are only menial jobs that will hire you.

Across from my apartment is one place I cannot get out of my head and it soon became my obsession, it’s a two-bedroom apartment that looks normal during the day but at night it’s darkened state was hypnotic. I noticed it the first time when I was going to work and just like every other apartment it looked normal but the furniture looked out of place. The stood closer to the window to get a better look and could make out the simple pieces of furniture like the sofa was like those country thatch style and the dinning table looked like it was made from left over wood. I was woken from my trance in trying to make out all the furniture by my phone alarm, I rushed to work and made a note to check the place better once I got home.

I arrived home late due to some issues, once home I rushed to the window to check the place I was looking at in the morning and found the lights were off and I could not see in that darkness. I was disappointed and decided to have dinner and sit next to the window in case the resident came back from work like me. The more I looked at the apartment and its darkened state the more I kept getting pulled into the void. I finished my dinner and cleaned myself off and tried to get some rest only to find myself back at the tiny table next to the window staring at the apartment. The darkness was addictive and I could not get enough, I kept asking myself why was I so attracted to it. Nothing made sense so I tried to sleep and check it in the morning.

The next day I was Sunday so I decided to have another look and found that it was as I had found it the other morning. I tried to see what kind of furniture there was in that place and the more I looked the faster time passed and before I knew it, it was 7pm and the lights went out and the darkness returned. This went on for months and still I could not get that place out of my head, then it happened.

One day, after I finished my dinner I was again looking at the apartment but to my surprise the lights were on. There was a figure standing with their back to me, I could not see much but I could figure that the person standing there was a child. I tried to squint and hopefully and get a better look but there was nothing I could make out. She just stood there, I sat on my chair just staring down at her willing her to move and maybe look up at me. As time passed my eyes began to strain and I was falling asleep, I closed my eyes just to give them a rest for the second and next when I opened them the lights were out and it was dark in that apartment. I stood up and tried to figure out what was going on and when I turned to go to bed I saw her outside my bedroom window, the same hair and dress. She was either floating in mid air or. I stood there looking at the figure, she did not move and then next thing I knew she was inside the room and her feet were floating above the floor and coming for me, I panicked but couldn’t scream. My mind raced and I tripped over something and I fell. I woke up in a panic only to notice it was dream and it my phone alarm was ringing, it was 5 am and I needed to get ready to go to work. I was soaked in sweat and when I looked across to the apartment and I froze, she had now turned and was looking at me.

I washed up and basically ran out of the apartment, the rest of the day was a blur for me. I was dreading to return home and did not want to face whatever I saw that night and yet some part of me wanted to know more. I did not know who I could ask about the place and neither did a friend who lived near me, I told her about everything and she looked at me like I was losing my mind. I did not want her to get caught up with the whole thing so I told to leave it as I walked into my apartment, she was behind me as I opened the door. I was looking at her when I opened the door and her face told me that there was something in my apartment, her eyes grew large and she looked like she was about to scream. I looked inside and there the figure I saw hanging from the light above, her hair was parted and I saw the face now. A bloated face of a teen girl, blue skin and mouth that looked like she was beaten before being hanged. My mouth went dry and the world seemed to drown under water, I was drowning and I could feel the scream from the friend behind me.

Her hands were outstretched to me, beckoning me to go to her.  I felt like I was walking towards her now, my feet on auto just moving forward. What happened next I cannot say but my friend told me that I was in trance walking towards the figure, my hands were outstretched to her. Just as I reached her my was being enveloped by a black cloud and it was like as if there was a swarm of mosquitoes covering me like a blanket. I did not know all this was happening to me, while that was occurring to me a few people came over to see what was happening and when they saw me being consumed by the black cloud one of them grabbed a can of deo and turned it into a flamethrower. The fire helped chase the black cloud but it left me in a coma.

Speaking to my friend in the hospital, she told me that my apartment was boarded up. No one was allowed to enter, a priest had tried to exorcise the place but he said that the spirit was now latched onto the apartment and would not leave. I was, maybe, a minute from being consumed by the spirit if the fire had not stopped it. I was lucky and right now I am recovering from almost losing my life to something I cannot fully explain. If you happen to find such an apartment near your place, I ask that you ignore or you might not be ask lucky as me.
