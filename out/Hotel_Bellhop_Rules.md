June 8th -------- This is just supposed to be a normal senior trip for our high school graduation, but as soon as it starts turning into a mountain. I had a erie feeling about this trip, as it starts to drive towards Hotel Bellhop, the driver was laughing crazily and crashed the bus into a tree.

"Ow" "Ouch", many students in the front sustained bad injury because of the crash, but students in the back row didn't feel anything. The driver was mysteriously missing as he was seen laughing last time before crashing the bus into a tree, "Hey, where did the driver go" Tyler said, "We haven't found him, didn't you guys see him in the front", "No" most said.

As soon as the Medical Members clean their wounds, we head into the hotel and sign up for our rooms. I got room code #609, its near the 7th floor that has recently been locked up for no reasons, as we started signing up our ID the hotel receptionist started giving us a list of rules in a paper, it reads
