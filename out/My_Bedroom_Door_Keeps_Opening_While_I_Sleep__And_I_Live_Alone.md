(This isn’t a story I made up. Or if it is... I’m still living in it.)

I live alone in a small apartment just outside the city. Nothing fancy — one bedroom, paper-thin walls, and old pipes that groan like they're in pain every time the heat kicks in. Sometimes, it sounds like... whispering.

I’m a light sleeper. Always have been. I triple-check everything before bed.

Front door? Locked. Knob twisted, deadbolt turned, chain latched.

Bedroom door? Shut. Fully. I can’t sleep if it’s even a crack open. It makes me feel watched — like something might be standing just beyond it. Waiting.

Then three weeks ago, I woke up at 3:14 a.m.

The bedroom door was open.

Not wide — just a few inches. Enough to see out into the hallway. Enough to imagine someone might be standing there, perfectly still.

I told myself I’d forgotten to close it properly. Maybe it didn’t catch. Maybe it bounced back.

But the next night? It happened again.

And then the night after that.

By the third night, I was sure. I’d shut it. I took a photo before I got in bed — door closed, handle turned, timestamped: 11:06 p.m.

But in the morning?

Open. Same small gap. Same feeling like the air had shifted. Like something had been there.

That’s when fear crept in.

I changed the locks. Installed a new deadbolt, even added a floor bar. I wedged a chair under the bedroom doorknob. I slept with a knife under my pillow.

None of it helped.

Every night, I’d wake up.
Every morning, the door was open.

So I bought a motion-sensor camera. Cheap, from Amazon. I set it up in the hallway facing my bedroom.

That night, I barely slept. The air felt… heavy. Like the room itself was waiting.

At exactly 3:41 a.m., I woke up. No noise. No movement. Just that sensation — the one that makes your hair stand on end. Like something was watching me. Not malicious. Not kind. Just interested.

The next morning, I checked the footage.

Normal. Nothing moved. No one came in.

Until 3:39 a.m.

The door opened. Smoothly. Slowly. Without the handle turning.
Then — just for one frame — the video glitched.

A figure stood in the hallway.

Not quite human. Not quite anything. Blurry. Warped. Like the camera couldn’t decide what it was seeing. The pixels shimmered, rippled — like heat on pavement.

Then it vanished.

The door continued to open.

I watched that moment over and over. I should have saved the footage. Backed it up.

But instead, I deleted it.

Not because I was afraid of what I saw.
But because I felt like… it saw me back.

Last night, the door opened again.

That doesn’t even surprise me anymore.

But this morning, there was a glass of water on my nightstand.

Full. Crystal clear. No condensation. No fingerprints. No water ring. Just… placed.

I didn’t get up. I didn’t leave my bed.

And I live alone.

I stared at it for a long time. My hands shook when I finally touched it. The water was ice-cold. As if it had just been poured — by someone else.

Tonight, it was different.

There was a folded blanket at the foot of my bed. Soft. Clean. Not mine.

And my wallet?

Gone.

No signs of entry. No mess. Just… missing.

I don’t know what’s happening. But it feels like something is watching me. Learning me.

It gives. It takes.
It’s trading.

First, it opened the door.

Then, it entered the room.

Now, it’s leaving gifts.

And taking things I value.

What scares me most isn’t the thought that I’m being haunted.

It’s that something is trying to be invited in.

Not all hauntings are violent. Some are patient.

Some wait.

Some earn their place.

Maybe even... trying to be kind.

But why...?
