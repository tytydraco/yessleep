This happened just a few nights ago, and even now I can't stop replaying it in my head. I don't care if it sounds insane—something was in that river. And I don’t think it was human.

For some background, I’m an 18-year-old guy. That night, I was hanging out with three of my friends—ages 17, 18, and 19—at a quiet spot near a riverbank. It’s one of those chill places people go to watch the sunset, crack jokes, and escape the chaos of home for a while. But there’s something about this river. The older folks in our area say it’s cursed—or haunted. My mom, especially, is very religious and always warned me never to go near it after dark.

We never really believed that stuff. That night changed everything.

We were sitting by the edge, talking and laughing, when we started hearing strange noises coming from the water. At first, it sounded like ripples or maybe frogs, but it didn’t sit right. The longer we sat there, the weirder it got. The sounds became heavier… like something breathing or slithering just beneath the surface. And then the air shifted—it felt colder, heavier, and dead silent around us, like the world was holding its breath.

Then we saw it.

A dark figure started to rise from the water. No boat. No flashlight. No fishing rod. Just… a person-shaped silhouette emerging straight from the river.

We all went dead quiet. For a moment we tried to rationalize—maybe it was a fisherman? But there are no houses on the other side of that river. No trails. No paths. That side is just thick, empty forest. And who the hell fishes alone, after sunset, in complete darkness, with no light?

We stared, frozen. The figure didn’t say a word. It just stood there for a second, then started walking toward us. Fast.

Not running. Just a fast, deliberate walk like it knew exactly where we were. It didn’t stumble, didn’t make any sound—just moved with this quiet, terrifying confidence.

That was the moment we all bolted.

None of us said a word. We just turned and ran like hell, stumbling through the dirt path back to the main road. None of us looked back. No one even thought about pulling out a phone. It was like something ancient inside us just screamed: RUN.

But the weirdest part? It didn’t end there.

When I got home, I was still shaking. My shirt was damp with sweat. And then, out of nowhere, I got this crazy, sudden craving for singara (a spicy fried snack, like samosa). It didn’t make sense—I hadn’t eaten all day, but this craving hit so specifically and so hard, it was unnatural.

Before I could say anything, my mother turned toward me, eyes serious, and said:
"You’ll crave fried things tonight. Don’t eat them."

I froze.

I hadn’t said a word about the craving. Nothing about the river, either. And yet, she knew. She always believed in spirits, in river devtas and hungry ghosts. She believes that when you encounter a spirit, especially near water, it can leave something attached to you—and it feeds through cravings, especially for fried or rich foods. She made me promise not to eat anything oily, and lit incense in front of the tulsi plant right after.

I followed what she said. But something still feels… off.

I don’t know what we saw by that river. I don’t know what it wanted. But I do know this: I wasn’t just scared. I was chosen—or maybe just noticed.

If you’ve ever had something follow you back from a place like that… tell me what you did. Because I don’t think this is over yet.
