In my mothers house far away from the nearby town, there lay a mysterious relic of our family lineage. Within the old formica kitchen dresser unit, which possessed a comforting musty but not unpleasant smell, sat A jar of unopened jam. 

This jar of jam had always been around for as long as I remembered and definitely for as long as I was tall enough to see into the pull down frosted glass cupboards. 

The unopened jar sat patiently residing in the right-hand side of the kitchen cupboard, its label fragile and delicate. 

This forbidden cooked fruit always intrigued me and one day when I was little I stood up on my tippy toes and reached into the cupboard, my shoulder over stretched and my fingers pinching at the glass trying to get it in my grasp. 

As I managed to grab the jar and began to drag it towards me, I could feel the delicate and ancient label flutter in my hand, as brittle as a dead moth…but no sooner than my little reaching hands had grabbed onto it, I felt myself being wrenched back into the kitchen. 

My mother delicately and silently took the fragile glass from my hands and placed it back in the right hand side of the cupboard and closed the cupboard door, its magnets connecting with a satisfying click. 

I was about to ask why I couldn’t have the jam when her face said it all, I never reached for the jam again and it sat undisturbed in it's prison of the sideboard. It continued to live in my mothers cupboard for what seemed like an eternity. 

I got married, I had a beautiful daughter, my father died, I got divorced and yet, the jam remained. Still sat in the cupboard, a strange family heirloom.  

No one could fathom why our mother held onto the jar, nor what secrets it harbored, but it persisted throughout time immemorial, its contents untouched and its origin concealed.

As each woman in our family succumbed to the inevitable march of time, the jar remained. No explanations were given, yet an unspoken agreement bound us to the posterity of the jam. 

Of course, the day inevitably came when my mother passed away. As I'd grown older and become consumed with my own life, the jam had slipped my mind but as the last of the boxes were being taken out and the sound of the vacuum was whirring away, it dawned on me...

I left the jar sitting in the right hand corner of the cupboard for days until eventually I had no other choice but to deal with it. 

The small house was caught in a wind storm which had caused the power to go out, just my luck on the final moving day but I persisted. I found a pack of unopened taper candles under the stairs and a box of matches. Mum was always prepared in an old fashioned way that I just hadn’t inherited but I was pleased she was because I at least had some light to help me get the final few jobs done. 

As the house seemed to breathe with the wind rattling through it’s now almost empty bones, I did one last sweep of the kitchen…”The Jam” i thought to myself. 

I unclicked the magnet and pulled the glass door open, there it sat on its own, lonely and forgotten. 

I thought, well, mums not around to tell me no this time and so I swiped the jar, picked up a teaspoon from the sink, the last one saved to make a necessary cup of tea, and I sat down on the brown carpeted floor, the jar clutched tightly to my chest. 

The label on the front of the jar was so thin and fragile, it had almost taken on the texture of a wasps nest now and it was in danger of disintegrating entirely. It fluttered in the wind which had managed to sneak in through the gaps in the windows. Even precariously close to the candle light, I couldn't discern whatever was once written on it, the front had completely faded away to a thin line of disintegrated ink. 

I stared at the jar one last time and defiantly twisted the lid. It made a satisfying pop. 

The family heirloom, passed down through the generations was now sullied. I, a curious great-granddaughter, dared to defy the unspoken agreement and finally opened the age old family jam. 

I sat and thought about just how much trouble I would've been in had mum still been around so I mouthed a silent sorry up towards the ceiling to try and placate my sudden pang of guilt but the temptation was too strong and the jam smelled heavenly, not stale or musty as I'd expected but like the sweetest strawberries that had ever been grown. 

I lifted up the spoon to taste this divine antique, as I did so, a chilling wind, stronger than anything the storm outside had given thus far, swept through the kitchen, extinguishing the flickering candles, plunging me into darkness.

As I sat in silence, clutching at the jar, in the dimness, a hiss seemed to engulf me and a wispy, shadowy figure emerged, its presence permeating the room with ancient sorrow. I froze, my hand gripping tighter around the jar, the spoon dropping out of my other hand, clattering to the ground. It was in that moment that I realised that the jar held not just an ancient preserve but the lingering essence of a long-lost ancestor. The fragile label which finally gave up, fluttered down, landing upon my boot, as it did, it revealed on the back that there was the name of a forgotten soul.

As I sat terrified on the floor, I could feel the presence leaning over me, lurching for the jar. I felt a wetness drip on my hand which was unmistakable, the splash of tears. 

Then it came to me. This wasn’t just forbidden jam, this was made with the tears of a grieving widow, one from my family. It suddenly all rushed through me, like a tape on rewind, it was in my blood, the pain was too much to bear and my heart winced in pain and I began sobbing uncontrollably. 

I then realised, this was no ordinary jar of preserves, this was made with the truest love there ever could be, the people we came from, the lost love which bound them, her tears were all that was left of it. She didn't know how to save it but to make it into something nurturing, loving, sweet, preserved. With each passing generation, our family kept a spectral pact alive, all of us were bound by the haunted jam that transcended time and mortality but in which kept the heartbeat of the family alive. 

Without it, there would be no us.

And so, as the wind whispered through the darkened room and the sounds surrounded me to a deafening crescendo, I secured the lid. As I did so, the candles spluttered back into flame and the sound of the howling wind stopped. 

I stood up, dabbed the tears from my face and took the jar home with me where I placed it in my own kitchen cupboard, on the right hand side and closed the door. I hugged my daughter and quickly placed a new label on the jar, on the back I wrote her name.
