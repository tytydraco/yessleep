It’s always the same ocean.  
  
I find myself floating in the same spot, in the same sea, over and over again in my dreams. And it’s always idyllically peaceful, at first. The water is warm and tingly, as if the entire ocean is carbonated. It feels good, the bubbles on my skin and the docile waves gently rocking me as I float in place. It’s easy to float, as all the little bubbles push me upwards.

The calm, peaceful waters stretch out in all directions for as far as I can see, blending with the pink and gold horizon, which paints the sea in the same colors.  The glowing orange sky is laden with cotton-candy-colored clouds, which all taper off into darker blues, and eventually to a night sky full of stars, directly overhead.

I always want to stay here. But I know it won’t last.

 

They say when you have a lucid dream, you can control things. That you’re the master of all you see. But that hasn’t been the case for me. I become well-aware that I’m in the same dream only a few minutes into my blissful float, and the same sinking fear returns, seeming to pull my body downwards along with my spirit. I have no control, only memories of previous times in this dream. I cannot wake myself up. I cannot escape from it. I can only hope the outcome is different this time. That the excruciating pain can be avoided by doing something different.

 

So far, it’s been utterly useless. As the sky grows blacker, dark heavy clouds roll in, and the sea changes from a warm, tingly gold to a still, black surface. That always surprises me. I would expect with the heavy clouds that a storm would be coming in, that the winds would pick up and the sea would become turbulent.

But something much worse happens.

All movement in the sea ceases. The waves stop completely, and it’s like swimming through a black glass surface. An awful stillness comes over the whole ocean, like something very big is about to happen. The air feels alive, electric. I know that the change coming to the sea is by far the worst of all, and my window of opportunity to swim is very limited.

I’ve tried swimming in different directions each time, but it doesn’t seem to matter. I always end up in the same place. I’m not even sure if I actually am going in a different direction each time or not, because there’s no sun in this dream world. Even at the beginning, when the sky is painted like a sunset, the sun isn’t visible, so there’s no way to tell which direction is which.  I always just pick a random direction and start swimming.

Eventually, the white lighthouse comes into view, emerging from the dark horizon. The search light is never on, but it’s also never so dark that I cannot see the ivory tower against the overcast skies. I can feel the change in the sea intensify as I approach; a wriggling, slimy feeling that tells me I’m almost out of time.

Usually my fear-propelled swim allows me to make it to the tiny, rocky island that the lighthouse stands on, before the sea completely transforms.

The still, black waters of the sea always metamorphosize into twisting, churning black sludge. Soon, it isn’t water at all, but an endless seascape of black snakes; their shining, slithering bodies intertwining with each other in an endless, squirming dark mass.

I can still remember from somewhere that snakes represent all kinds of things in dreams, from fear of decisions, to symbolizing toxic things or people. But in this place, even knowing that it’s only a dream, the snakes are all too real. They don’t seem to simply be metaphors. I can smell their musky, greasy stink, practically taste it in the air. Each of my senses register them as snakes, and in one way or another, they are always the reason I that I die.

 

The first few times, I would stay too long in the pleasant, happy, bubbling waters. The sky and sea would still turn dark around me, and all would turn to snakes, even though I hadn't moved. And I would feel all of it.

Thousands upon thousands of vicious bites punctured my skin as I sank into the endless depths of the slimy black coils. Each new depth would alert hundreds of new snakes, which in turn would sink their fangs into every inch of my body, tearing flesh and pumping in burning venom. Opening my mouth to scream is always a mistake, as a snake will find its way inside and bite the insides of my mouth. I can feel the venom quickly flood my veins, but the anticipated release of death that I long for is always too agonizingly slow.

A growing numbness and sense of distance from my own body starts as I continue to sink down into the slimy, vicious mass, before I suddenly realize I’m back in the warm, fizzy waters of the sea. It feels almost as if my spirit is taken from one dying body and placed in another.  
  
Often the change between of the worst pains imaginable to being completely pain free in a pleasant environment is so jarring, that I forget to start swimming again, and the entire scenario repeats itself before I can make it to the lighthouse.

 

This isn’t just a repeating dream I have every night. I wish it were that merciful. This is a dream I cannot escape from. I am here, in this endlessly repeating dreamscape, for what feels like forever.

I don’t know what this is, nor am I able to remember how I got here. I have a general idea of my life before, but it’s all fuzzy, like trying to remember a dream after you wake up.

Right now, I have three theories about what’s happening to me, all of them equally disturbing.

The first is that I am simply asleep, trapped within a dream time that feels far longer than real time. While that might not seem so bad at first, it has brought me to the realization that it’s possible I will suffer for what feels like months or even years, only to awaken for the day with little or no memory of what happened. Then each night, I fall asleep and once again embark on this nightmare.

The second theory is I’m in a coma, lying in a hospital bed somewhere. That would help explain the unusually vivid sensations in this hallucinatory world. I also wonder if perhaps when the sea is warm and pleasant, if that’s the doctors giving me pain medication, and the excruciating pain that wracks my body when the snakes attack is the feeling of it wearing off. I don’t remember being in any kind of accident that would have landed me in a hospital, but then again, I don’t remember a whole lot of my previous life.

The third theory is that I am dead. Perhaps this is the afterlife, or some kind of purgatory. This theory is most plausible to me when overlaid with the events that transpire after I enter the lighthouse, but then, it also seems to strengthen the sleeping and coma theories as well, so I really don’t know.

 

The question now is, does it really matter? Every action I’ve taken since coming to this nightmare always ends with me falling into the snakes despite my very best efforts. I don’t know if there is really a way out of here, or if some great entity functioning as a jailer continues to toy with me, offering me false hope before taking it away.

 

Either way, I don’t have a choice, because the snakes will consume me faster if I do nothing.

 

I have searched the tiny rocky island on which the lighthouse sits, which is barely larger than the lighthouse itself. Many times during my careful searches, individual snakes have leapt out of the black sea and bitten me, immobilizing my body until I helplessly tumble in. And each of my outside searches has revealed the same thing, that the island is only a slab of jagged, sharp rock, with barely enough room between the lighthouse and the sea for me to make a full circuit.

 

Inside the lighthouse, on the bottom floor, is where I spend most of my time. There is a wooden desk, a chair, and a lantern hanging on the ceiling overhead. Two sets of stairs follow the curve of the tower walls. One of them leads to the top of the lighthouse, while the other leads down into a basement, carved deep into the rocky slab.

 

If I follow the downward spiral of stairs, I’ll come to find a thick wooden door. It guards the basement, and it's locked with a heavy iron bar, but the lock is on the outside of the door. If I lift the bar and enter the basement, I find it's smaller than the first floor of the lighthouse, with only one thing in it. A large, locked wooden chest. I do not have the key, and I haven’t found one anywhere so far. Which is probably a good thing, because whatever is inside the box is not good.

It’s a person, but I don’t know who. They’re screaming in rage.  
  
I can hear the pounding of fists against wood and see the chest rattle and shake. I’ve tried to talk to whoever is in the box, but they don’t converse with me. The bellows of fury continue at the same pace, as if I were not speaking at all. Nothing I have done, including screaming back and kicking the box has gotten their attention.  
  
This being a dream of some kind, I also have a certain knowledge. Things I definitely know, that I would not have any way of knowing in the real world. And what I know for certain, is that whoever is in the box wants to hurt me. Whoever it is, isn’t just evil, but also very strong and extremely intelligent. If I were to let them out, they would find ways to make my experience here even worse.

Not that getting eaten alive by snakes over and over again is an ideal existence, but at least I do have some respite here in the lighthouse. I can, for a time, not be in pain. I have time to think, to try to work out what to do, to solve this nightmare.

I just know that if I let whoever is in the chest out, they will still be out the next time I die and come back. They may prevent me from getting on the island at all, or find newer, even more painful and tortuous ways to kill me.

And even if I wanted to, I can’t let them out. So I avoid the basement most times.

If I follow the other set of stairs, they take me to a wooden door high up along the wall of the lighthouse. Opening the door, I find myself on a balcony outside.

Up high, the wind is strong and fierce, which is odd because there is absolutely no wind at sea level. I’ve tested it many times, stepping out onto the fierce wind-whipped balcony with murderously black clouds rolling in overhead, then running downstairs and stepping out to the rocky island, where the wind is completely still.

   
The huge light on top of the tower is electrical, despite the lighthouse itself seeming to be of an older design that used fire. If I flip the switch on the back, it will turn on and slowly start spinning, illuminating the endless, black, writhing snake-sea below.

There is nothing to be seen on the horizon. I can see for miles and miles, but the squirming sea and the billowing black storm remain perfectly flat against one another, no structures, islands, or ships in sight.

I could stay up there, or down in the lighthouse’s first floor, and I often do for as long as I can. The problem is that after some time, the sea starts to rise. Or the island starts to sink. I really don’t know which is happening because both would look the same to me. The endlessly wriggling surface of the black sea begins to slowly, inexorably, head towards the top of the tower.

Staying inside means watching the individual snakes slide under the door and through the cracks until the entire front caves in under the immense weight. My tortuous death inside the tower is like falling into the sea itself.

If I stay on the balcony, I have to watch the slowly rising flood of snakes creep towards me, anticipating the feelings of once again being covered by thousands of venomous fangs.

More recently, I have discovered a response that I can stimulate from the world around me, though I do not understand it.

Pointing the lighthouse beam at the sea does nothing, but if I managed to find a gap in the clouds, even a small one, and point the light beam through it, something truly remarkable happens.

The light beam itself will change from a straight, smooth column to a set of stairs, made of light.

I have tried so many times to climb this incorporeal staircase, only to fall into the sea of snakes every time. There isn’t even a millisecond where I feel the stairs are holding my weight. I cannot feel them anymore than I can feel a beam of light.

But it’s something.

When I first discovered the way to make the staircase, I was overjoyed. I thought I had finally found my salvation. Now I see it as a cruel joke, a way to further my misery by offering a false hope.

But it must *mean* something.

Right now, I’m working off the theory that if I do something in particular, the staircase will become solid enough for me to climb. I have no idea what I need to do, but I keep searching for the answer. In fact, writing all this down is one of the things I’m trying. I found a pen and a few sheets of paper in the back of the drawer inside the desk. Perhaps writing out my story is what I’m supposed to do.

But as I have been writing this, something has occurred to me. I remember from somewhere that you cannot read printed words in dreams. I don’t know for sure if this is true, but I remember something about how the brain cannot handle reading written words inside of a dream it’s currently creating, yet I can still read my own writing perfectly.

Combined with the ultra-sharp sensations I have from all five of my senses, I’m starting to craft another theory about where I am. I wonder, that though this world doesn’t seem to make sense in the way the physical world would, perhaps I am also not entirely within my own mind.

What if my spirit has become separated from my body, either when I fell asleep or was knocked into a coma, and was then pulled to another dimension, where my darker subconscious fills the space I see? Maybe I’m creating a continuous feedback loop of my own subconscious fears, a kind of hell of my own making, and yet it’s real. What would have been my dream, but only a dream, is now powering the reality of this very real dimension.

 

I don’t know for sure and will probably never know if I can’t find a way out of here. But as I near the end of the paper available to me, I have discovered there is also a glass bottle with a cork in it. It too, was in the back of the desk drawer. I don’t know if I missed it each time I checked previously, or if it appeared there because I have done what I needed to do by writing this out. The only thing I have left to do is put the paper in the bottle and throw it far out into the sea of snakes.

 

If this is all in my mind, then no one will ever be able to read this. But if someone somehow ends up reading this, if my message one day makes it through from this world to yours, it will confirm my last theory. That this place is somehow a real dimension, not a metaphysical, subconscious mind-trap, but a place with very real, physical things. That somehow, we are all in danger of being trapped in here when we lose consciousness, perhaps losing all memory of the trauma when we awake, but nonetheless experiencing eons of torture, loneliness, and hopelessness every time our spirits and bodies separate.

 

If that’s the case, and one day you find yourself in the same place I have, then I hope you can remember what I’ve done. If you find yourself in a warm and pleasant sea, start swimming. I don’t think it matters which direction, just swim as fast as you can. When you come to the lighthouse, remember the trick to creating the stairs of light. I don’t know if writing this message has something to do with perhaps making them solid enough to climb, or if the screaming, evil entity in the basement chest has something to do with it too. This is my first time trying any of this, so I guess I’ll see. If it fails, I don’t know if the glass bottle and paper will re-appear. If they do, I’ll write updates on what’s happened.

Good luck to you on your own journey, I have to go now. The sea is rising.
