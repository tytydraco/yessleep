Well I went to bed at 11:00 last night, and woke up at 2:00. I received a call from Sgt. Harrison telling me to come down to the station. I arrived at roughly 2:30 AM. I will admit I took a couple minutes of personal time to stop by the gas station and grab a can of Grizzly Wintergreen and a Monster, I quit about 10 years ago but I feel like it’s gonna be one of those days. 

The two officers sent to investigate Jake’s property were Trooper Davidson, and Sgt. Ramirez. Ramirez went to investigate the house while Davidson went to investigate outside the property. Ramirez found Jake sitting in the kitchen table with a lit candle and his M1911 as well as a cup of coffee and he appeared to sharpening an old hunting knife. Both officers were alerted to the panic alarm of the police cruiser and sound of shattering glass. Ramirez reported hearing gunshots and yelling from behind the barn as well as an “ungodly shrieking”. Here is the following radio transmission from the incident.

*Car alarm and shattered glass*

Davidson: “What the fuck?”

*footsteps*

Davidson: “Sir what are you doing in this property you are trespassing.”

Suspect: *unintelligible*

Davidson: “Stand down.”

Suspect: *Unintelligible*

Davidson: “What the hell are you wearing what the fuck stand down, get back, final warning.” 

Suspect *unintelligible*

*Gunshots and a crunching noises*

Ramirez: “Ramirez to station [Redacted] we have and officer down, suspect is nowhere to be seen one civilian in protective custody all available units please come to assist at [Redacted].”

Harrison and I arrived shortly after the incident as well as another officer of whom I’m not familiar with. Davidson was in rough shape and had to be airlifted to the hospital in Salt Lake. Jake insisted on staying at the ranch so Harrison and myself elected to stay with him throughout the rest of the night. Ramirez and the other officer went home. One thing I would like to note is that the other officer had arrived at the scene about 5 minutes after Harrison and I did. Both Harrison and Ramirez commented on an awful stench around the area around the time of the third trooper’s arrival.

After Ramirez and the other trooper left, the three of us, myself, Harrison, and Jake. Went into the house while Jake went to bed. Harrison and I took shifts throughout the night and when morning came I woke both of them up and took Jake to the station for protection. On the way back we received a transmission that Ramirez was found dead, tore to pieces on the side of the road about 5 miles from the farm. Jake about had a heart attack hearing that saying that the god damned nazi skinwalker killed Ramirez. Now it’s all starting to make sense. Ramirez was a good man and we just let that happen to him. I mean sure we were all tired but how did we not notice that unidentified trooper was the enemy. This is really starting to creep me out.

One more notable thing happened today, Jake stated that Otto had grown more powerful and was now unable to be killed by saying his name. He also pulled out an old tobacco tin that was full of old SS buttons. He said that they were trophies of his kills and he thinks that they are what’s been attracting Otto to harass him. We are currently working on a plan to try to kill this bastard before the feds get involved and try to take over. Jake thinks we can use them as bait. We are planning on taking a trip to the local Navajo Reservation to see if we can get some help.

Trooper Micheals has joined the team as well, we sent him out to a local church to get our service pistols blesses a priest, Jake said it would be an extra precaution. Speaking of which I have really enjoyed getting to know Jake, he also had some useful information about the case. You remember the picture in the first post right? The one with him and a woman? That was his wife, Emily. She went missing in 1946 when Jake was out of town. They never found the killer but they found parts of her scattered around Southern Idaho. It’s also worth mentioning that lots of Jake’s livestock has been murdered throughout the years until he retired in the late 1980s. We are planning on going back to the farm to check out his trophy case, he claims he has some useful “tools” that he took off some less than benevolent characters during the war. 

I’ve also been doing some of my own research on the matter at hand. I think I’m going to invest in some white ash and silver weaponry. Davidson is still in the hospital and we have no idea what’s going on there but we can only hope he’ll recover.

We are a bit short staffed over here but we have made contact with the local sheriffs department who are sending support to ensure we have at least 3 officers on the property at any given time. We also have people looking into Davidson’s body cam footage to see what might have happened. There is no information on Ramirez however, his body cam was destroyed and there’s no evidence except that he was mutilated beyond recognition except for his badge and pistol. Detectives are looking into the third trooper as well, if it’s a skinwalker then this was obviously a real officer who fell victim to a walker. But it makes me feel uneasy how it came in possession of a cruiser of ours.

But it’s starting to get late and we are all beyond tired, except for Jake of course. He is starting at the wall muttering abou my “you nazi bastards” and “you took everything from me I’m going to do to you like I did to your buddies back in Germany”. He is very energetic and healthy for a 100 year old man who smokes a pack of cigarettes every day and seems to be driven by hate and revenge. Anyway I’m going to call it a night and I’ll update as soon as I get more information on Davidson’s well being and any more information on the  Ramirez incident. Good night.
