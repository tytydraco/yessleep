Some call him the Grinning King.

Others know him as the Merry Reveller, or the Mirthmaker.

By most accounts, though, he is named Rictus.

Are you familiar with the stories?

My cousin told me the legend, originally. They say that if someone wrongs you, crosses you somehow, does something cruel, and you want to seek retribution, you call out to Rictus. You summon him.

*How* do you summon him?

I won’t dole out particulars, not in a forum like this one. The summoning, you might guess, can be dangerous, and you don’t want to post that kind of information publicly. It’d be like sharing the instructions for building a pipe bomb. Just irresponsible.

There’s a catch, too: If you ask Rictus to take revenge against a particular someone, and then it turns out your justification was contrived or unfair or deceptive somehow, the retribution reverts back onto you.

I know this because I made the mistake of summoning Rictus myself.

Here’s what happened:

It was the first weekend of spring break. My family has recently relocated to a new city. My dad had undergone some shake-up with his job, which required us to move right in the middle of the school year. I was still finding my footing at the new school when a group of other girls invited me to an afternoon pool party.

I had expected a small gathering, but it ballooned up huge, a whole slew of kids trickling in over the course of hours. The host was this girl named Ashley, and though her mom was there supervising, several of the kids spirited in vodka and started spiking their cans of soda and their bottles of lemonade.

Soon things turned unruly.  

Now it just so happened that my mom and dad were out of town that weekend. They had taken my little brother to a basketball tournament. Largely because of that, I didn’t spike my beverage. I had to drive myself home that evening, plus I was paranoid of getting wasted and spending the night alone at our new residence getting sick or puking.

But as the afternoon wore on and tons of these kids got tanked, I let slip that my family was away for the weekend, and my newish friend Danni started joking about how we should all go back to my place that night to continue partying.

No way was I gonna allow this.

As you’re probably noticing, I’m naturally cautious. Why? Because I’m one of those people who *always* gets caught. I don’t know if it’s some kind of karma from a previous life, but whenever I get slick or try to bend the rules, I get busted. Happens every time.

But one guy present at the party, this dude Miles, he heard Danni talking about how my house was sitting empty and he started badgering me to let them all come over there for a house party. He was blitzed, and he just kept going on and on about it, really pushing me, well past the point where it was funny. Still, it made no difference to me how hard he pushed–it wasn’t happening. Because to reiterate: I *always* get caught. My parents, they have a way of finding out when I try to pull any kind of shenanigans. In this instance, I figured a neighbor would call or text them to gripe, or maybe the cops would show up in response to some noise complaint, something like that.

So I told Miles no.

He pushed and prodded, and badgered and bullied, but I kept right on telling him no. The whole thing sort of ruined the party for me.

Pretty quick after that, I drove home. Alone, sober.

That night at the house, well after dark, the power went out.

I was there by myself, groggy with that sun-blasted feeling you get after a day by the poolside. I was sitting in my room, playing a tower siege game on my phone and iMessaging on my laptop, when the lights went off, the wi-fi cut out. All that routine hiss and hum of an electrified home, that white noise of modern domestic life, it died suddenly.   

The situation was freaky.

I thought about calling the cops. Wasn’t this the type of ploy used by serial killers before they infiltrated your property? I’m pretty sure I’ve listened to true crime podcasts about this sort of thing. But in the moment, it seemed like that might be overkill, phoning the cops.

In hindsight, I should have done it.

Instead I wandered downstairs and peeked outside. The lights were on at all the surrounding houses. Only our home had lost power.

So I decided to leave, bug out entirely. No way was I gonna wait around for some serial killer to come slithering through a bedroom window.

Where did I plan to go? Can’t say for sure. A friend’s house, maybe? Except I didn’t really have any reliable friends in the area. I just knew I couldn’t stay there, diddling around in the dark as the threat grew. I didn’t care if the house got ransacked and robbed; I just didn’t want to be present when it occurred.

So I put on my sneakers, grabbed the car keys and zipped to the front door.

As I opened it, as I stepped out to the porch, a hail of objects came flying out of the blackness.

It was confusing and startling.

The items popped and splattered. They exploded against the door, the wall, the pillar. Goop spewed. Slime spat all around me.

Eggs.

They were eggs.

I’d walked right into an ambush.

One of the eggs thunked against my leg. Yolk dribbled, wet against my calf. Another hit my shoulder. A third popped against my head, the glop dripping and drooling down my neck.   

I retreated back into the house and managed to slam shut the door. Several more eggs smacked and burst outside.

I stood there, shuddering, dripping in goo, until the barrage stopped. This was all some vicious prank, and the pranksters had gone.

I dropped down to the floor, my back against the door, and started crying. The panic, thumping and hot, ratcheted the sun-blasted feeling till it seemed like my skin was burning.      

I didn’t text my parents. I didn’t message any friends from my old school. I was too embarrassed to tell anyone what had occurred. Why had I blabbed my mouth at the party about my family being gone? Why had I ventured outside after the power went out? So stupid. 

Rancid with raw egg glop, I climbed into the shower, quaking under the steamy spray. When I had finished and towel-dried my hair, I blasted YouTube videos on my cell phone until I fell asleep on the sofa.

The next morning, emboldened by the light of day, I went outside and located the breaker box. The master switch had been flipped off, killing the power, and I reactivated it.

The pressing question, though: Who had done this?

Surely it was someone who’d known I was staying there alone. Other than my immediate family, no one but the kids at the pool party possessed that knowledge.

*Miles.*

The answer seemed obvious: It was Miles who had pranked me. Maybe a couple others had assisted, but Miles had obviously spearheaded it.

I stewed alone in the house that whole day, and the stories of Rictus, the lore and legends I’d heard whispered at slumber parties and campfires over the years, they came flooding back to me. I started dashing off texts. I poked friends, and then friends of friends. Anyone who had ever mentioned to me their knowledge of the entity and the summoning procedures. I kept my questions vague, open-ended, so they wouldn’t grasp my intent.

Like I said, I won’t divulge details. It would be reckless of me, especially considering what came next.

But I’ll tell you this much: I staged the rite the following night when my parents were still away with my brother.

I summoned him, all by myself.

I called out to the Grinning King, and he came to me.

I performed the invocation in our basement playroom, the lights off but for a bunch of candles. I had disconnected the smoke detectors, and when he manifested, when he appeared amidst the smoke, raising himself and standing amidst the haze, I couldn’t see much of him. Only fleeting impressions. I had the vague sense of redness. His garb was the stitched-together motley you sometimes hear mentioned in the stories. At least I think so. In truth, I was too distracted by what I could see of his face. True to his name, he wore a rictus grin. Frozen there. The skin pulled all taut across his skull.

I think he was trying to speak, but with his face convulsed in that rigid smile, his words came out in wet slurping sounds. I couldn’t understand him. My mind, too, had become sort of unhinged, like some part of my brain was trying to wall itself off from what I was seeing.

Rictus, moving in the creep of smoke, went rattling around in the bins of my brother’s old toys. He came out with a bucket of little plastic letters, the kind that children use to practice their spelling. He was improvising some method to communicate with me.

There were shudders wracking my entire body as I watched him array the first message.

*WHO CROSSED YOU?* he spelled on the nylon carpet.

Even in the low flicker of the candles, I could see his grinning face watching me. He was awaiting my answer.

So I told him.

I mentioned Miles by name. I stuttered out the whole story–the pool party and the power outage, the prank with the eggs.

Have you ever spoken with a demon before? Assuming that’s what he is, of course. No one seems to know for certain.

He heeded my story, his lips dewy and moist, breath husking. When I blundered into silence again, he raised the sharp prong of a finger and sifted letters on the carpet. He spelled one more message.

*DO YOU KNOW MY TERMS?*

I nodded yes, told him I had heard from others how he operates. I knew the conditions of our arrangement. You tell him who has wronged you, and what they did. If your cause is just, he will claim revenge on your behalf. But if your cause isn’t righteous, or if you lie, misrepresent the situation, seek to manipulate him, the revenge blows back on you.

I knew the risks, and I accepted them.

The smoke seemed to eddy. It shifted the candle glow. I lost him in the winding tendrils, and then I realized he had vanished entirely. Was he off to punish Miles that very night? I couldn’t say.

The next morning, I came to understand my folly.

In a group text of kids from my Algebra class, someone mentioned the pool party. Then someone else commented on the drinking, and another someone chimed in about Miles. Too much vodka for him, apparently. He had puked in the bushes leaving the gathering. He had tripped and face-planted trying to get to his buddy’s car. That same friend picked him up and foisted him into the passenger seat and drove him to the hospital, where the doctors pumped his stomach. They even kept him overnight for I.V. hydration.

Reading all this, I felt like the blood had leaked from my body.

I went cold, drained-out.

Miles had been in the hospital, you see, when the power went out at my house. He couldn’t have been the person hurling eggs at me from the darkness.

I had directed Rictus to take vengeance against the wrong person.

If your cause is righteous, they say, Rictus will seek retribution on your behalf. But if your cause is wanting, if you lie or manipulate or misdirect him, he visits the revenge back on you.

You follow my predicament?

By pointing Rictus toward an innocent, I have invited the harm back on myself.

So I need to know: What will he do to me? When will he do it?

Can anyone tell me?

In my shame and my haste, I made a terrible mistake.

What should I do?

I can’t stand the waiting. The dread of expectation.

It’s nerve-rattling, all of it. The trauma of the original prank. The burden of secrecy. The uncertainty and the paranoia. 

The waiting, though, that’s the worst part of all.
