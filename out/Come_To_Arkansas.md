I feel I may die soon... these are my last words but I have to warn people...I don't want anyone to suffer as I have and I can't let this fungus spread. Stay away from the forests In Arkansas. 

I had always loved the forest. There was something about the way the trees swayed in the breeze, the way the sunlight filtered through the leaves, that made me feel at peace. But that all changed when I encountered the creature.

It was a beautiful day, the kind of day that makes you want to be outside and procrastinate on studying for my college exam. So I decided to take a walk through the forest, to clear my head and enjoy the beauty of nature. But as I walked, I started to notice something strange. The trees were withering, the leaves turning brown and brittle. It was like something was sucking the life out of them.

At first, I thought it was just a natural occurrence, something that happened from time to time. But as I continued to walk, I noticed that the decay was spreading. The grass was turning yellow, the flowers were wilting, and even the air itself seemed thick with decay. I could smell the feint scent of petricor and rust. The taste of iron was slowly pooling in the back if my throat. 

I thought i heard a feint cry in the distance next to a large oak tree that was most certainly dry rotted. It's branches hung low and was covered in soot and a light green goop. The smell of rot was really strong so I covered my nose. The scream gotten louder and sounded like it was behind the tree I was staring at. I turned to see behind it and that's when I saw it. 

A strange, pulsating mass of fungus, growing on the side of a tree. At first, I thought it was just a harmless plant, but as I got closer, I could see that it was alive. The tendrils reached out, pulsing with a sickly green glow, and I could feel my skin crawl with revulsion.

I tried to back away, but it was too late. The tendrils lashed out, wrapping themselves around my arms and legs, pulling me closer. I could feel them burrowing into my skin, their touch like a thousand needles piercing me all at once. 

The pain was unimaginable. It was like nothing I had ever felt before, a searing agony that threatened to consume me. But even worse than the pain was the feeling of decay. It was like the creature was sucking the life out of me, as if it was consuming my very life essence. I could feel my lips crack and body twitch. 

I don't know how long I was there, trapped in the creature's grasp. It felt like an eternity, but it could have been only minutes. When it finally released me, I stumbled away, my body wracked with pain and exhaustion. At the time I didn't think twice why I was let go I just wanted to seek help. At this time I couldn't even believe what happened. It felt so surreal...

But the worst was yet to come. As I stumbled through the forest, I could feel the decay spreading through my body. My skin was turning black and flaking away, my hair falling out in clumps. I could feel my muscles wasting away, my bones turning brittle.

I knew I was dying, but even worse than that, I could feel the darkness spreading through my mind. It was like the creature was infecting my very thoughts, consuming my sanity and leaving me a mindless husk. It was telling me to find help and to spread it's love.

I don't know how I managed to make it back to civilization. It was like some primal instinct drove me forward, pushing me through the pain and exhaustion. But when I finally collapsed, I knew that I was beyond saving, beyond help. 

I can feel the fungus spreading through my body, consuming me from the inside out. I can feel my mind slipping away, my thoughts becoming jumbled and confused. But even worse than that, I can feel the creature's influence spreading through the world. As if everything I saw was dying but that couldn't be reality could it? I was angry beyond reason at this point yelling at God. 

Everywhere I look, I see decay. The trees are withering, the flowers are wilting, and even the air itself seems thick with corruption. It's like the creature is infecting everything I come into contact with, spreading its dark influence throughout the world. I had to stop it so I took my bag with my laptop and hid in the forest get away from people. I don't want people to end up like me. I toyed with the idea of maybe sacrificing some poor schmuck instead of me. But I couldn't do that...

I don't know what will happen to me when I die. Maybe I'll just be another victim, consumed by the fungus or maybe something else will happen. I can feel the fungus's influence growing stronger within me, like a dark seed sprouting in my mind. It's like it's preparing me for something, like it has a purpose for me beyond just consumption and decay.

I don't know what that purpose is, but I'm afraid. Afraid of what I might become, of what the world might become under the things influence. How do I stop this thing?

As I lay here, feeling my body decay and my mind slip away, I can only hope that others will heed my warning. That they will stay away from the creature, avoid its touch at all costs. But I fear that it may already be too late. That the darkness has already taken hold, and that nothing can stop it now. Why does this have to be me? Why do I have to be chosen by this thing... God why..

I can hear the screams of the dying, the sound of flesh decaying and bones breaking. The sound of my skin tearing and muscles snapping.  It's a chorus of horror, a symphony of decay. And I know that soon, I will join them.

But even as the darkness consumes me, I can't help but wonder. Is there a way to stop the creature? Is there a way to fight back against the darkness? What will my mother do when I'm gone? 

I don't know... I have to accept this now. This is how it must be...But I....I...I want to tell you...I'm loosing my...grip...you...must at all costs...Come to Arkansas and visit the beautiful forest. Please, come and bring your family it's amazing out here!
