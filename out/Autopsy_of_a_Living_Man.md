“He’s perfectly healthy,” Milo said of the dead man.

I perused the file. Everything was in order, apart from the lack of heart rate and brain death. There was no cause to be established.

“I’m sure something will come up in the autopsy,” I said.

“It has to,” he said, “Men don’t drop dead of nothing.”

The scans turned back nothing. No foul play—at least none that’s obvious. Toxicology is clear. Not even the suggestion of a cause.

“Bet it’s heart attack,” I said.

“Bet it’s a stroke,” he said.

“Surely you would have caught that on the MRI?”

“Whatever.”

“The usual?”

An hour later, I had the table set. The man’s body laid in front of me. Mid 40s. A head of black hair with a widow’s peak shaped at the front. By almost all means, he looked perfectly normal.

Five hours later, I was done and had little to show for it. I rolled my head back as I scrubbed down. Exhausted and replete with confusion. A man died of nothing. A first in my 20 years of taking apart bodies.

I returned home. Sarah met me at the door. Dinner was ready. It was lovely.

We laid on the bed shortly after. I took her into my arms.

“What’s your biggest regret?” She asked.

“That’s a little deep for a Tuesday night,” I laughed.

“No but seriously,” she said, “What’s the one thing that if you were to die right now, you would think, ‘fuck, wish I could’ve done that differently’”.

“How am I dying?” I asked.

“That’s beside the point,” she said, “Seriously.”

“Okay,” I said, “This one time when I was a child, I went fishing at the local pond with a bunch of friends. One of them, Charlie, thought it would be funny to jump in and have a swim. She didn’t account for how cold the water would be.

“The shock set in. Then the reeds wrapped around her leg. We thought she was joking. But she died. I always think I could’ve done something. If not save her at least try and help her.”

“Fuck,” she said, “That’s awful. I’m sorry about that. But you were just a kid.”

“Yeah,” I said, “It is what it is.”

“You want to hear mine?”

My morning routine ran smoothly. Breakfast, shower then brush teeth. I ran the brush over both sets of teeth. Gentle but thorough. I spat the toothpaste out and heard a clang on the ceramic sink. When I looked down, a small object was heading toward the drain. I caught it before it disappeared.

A tooth. My tooth. A canine from the top left side. My gum looked fine. No bleeding when I spat. It had just flown out.

I called in sick and set an emergency appointment with my dentist.

“Your gums look fine,” he said, “No signs of gum disease or damage. No rough play, I assume. The tooth isn’t rotten. It shouldn’t have come out.”

“But it did,” I said, “There has to be a reason.”

“Sure,” he said, “But there’s nothing I can find from observation or xrays.”

I sighed, “I want a second opinion”.

None of the dentists around town found a problem. None of the one’s out of town either.

“Hey,” Milo said, “Where were you yesterday?”

“Sick,” I said.

The hospital canteen hosted few people. I usually take the quiet times. Milo follows.

“Yeah well I read your report,” he said, “Really found nothing?”

“Yeah.”

“Nothing at all?”

“Uhuh,” I said.

“Wow,” he said, “But there’s gotta be something right? I’ve gotta get my 50 bucks somehow.”

I poked my food with my fork. That morning, another tooth fell out. My dentist refused another appointment. And so did the others.

“Any news on identifying the body?” I asked.

“Nope,” Milo said, “Not a single call or nothing.”

“You think someone will call?”

“Fuck if I know,” he said, “Anyway, foosball table is free. Let’s play a game.”

Later, while writing a report in my office, I threw up into the trash can. It was bloody. A few minutes later, while in the disabled toilet, it happened again. I pulled off my stained t-shirt and the skin on my gut had turned a dark green.

I called in sick again. Went to the emergency room the next hospital over. A doctor examined me.

“There’s nothing wrong with you,” he said.

“The fuck do you mean?” I said, “I spewed up blood and my fucking flesh is decomposing.”

“I don’t see the problem Mr…”

“Doctor,” I said.

The next doctor I saw also found nothing wrong, instead referring me to a mental health professional.

I awoke the next morning with my left leg unable to move. It felt dead and stiff. Sarah tried to move it to no avail. The muscles would not relax and the leg wouldn’t bend. Although I could see clearly that the skin was purple and bruised, my wife attested that it was clear.

I called in sick and the doctors at the ER found nothing wrong with me. It took two days for the stiffness to fade. When it did, the leg was weak and I required a walking stick.

My boss called me into his office.

“Are you okay?” he asked.

“I’m fine,” I said.

“No, you’re not,” he said, “I’ve been getting calls saying you’re in and out of other hospitals about something they can’t find.”

“I’m having problems and they’re not doing their jobs right,” I said.

“Are you sick?” he said, “We can get you seen here.”

“No, no,” I said, “I’ve had enough of being assessed only to be told I’m nuts.”

“If they can’t find anything physically wrong with you, then what other choice do they have?”

My good leg hopped up and down. I knew where this was going.

“Take a few days off…”

“No.”

“...just to get your head straight.”

“Don’t do this.”

“It’ll be for the best.”

I returned home to a cold house. Dinner wasn’t prepared. I found Sarah hunched over the dinner table. Documents were spread out beneath her.

“Is it true?” she asked.

“What?”

“Is it true?”

There were photos, screenshots of text messages and little love notes. I didn’t have to lean in too much to figure out what they were.

“Yes,” I said, “It is.”

Sarah cried.

I knew it was best not to comfort her.

“It arrived in the mail,” she said through sobs, “I can’t believe you’d do this to me...to us!”

“I’m sorry,” I said.

“Who is she?” she asked.

“She was a nurse,” I said, “Fairly new to the hospital.”

“What’s her name?”

“Emma,” I said.

“Is she still working with you?”

“No,” I said, “She left a few months ago. I haven’t seen her since”

I slept on the sofa that night. Sarah worked the next day. When she returned home, I apologized. She accepted, said that she had the day to think about it and couldn’t go on like this.

Last night I dreamed of Charlie. In the dream, I was her. The vine wrapped itself around my foot. It pulled me beneath the water’s surface. The water filled my lungs within seconds. The distorted figures above water flitted back and forth. I could hear their muffled laughs.

I died alone.

The next morning, I woke up in my bed. I could hardly breathe. It felt like my lung had collapsed. Maybe it had.

Sarah had called in sick to work. Said she had to take the day off to prioritize us. We stayed home all day, mostly chatting and watching TV.

A call came through the landline late in the morning. I picked up the call.

“Did you receive my package?” the voice came through before I could speak.

“Who is this?” I asked.

“Did you receive my package?”

I leaned in close and hushed my voice. Didn’t want Sarah to listen.

“Who the fuck is this?”

The person on the other end sighed, “Did you receive my package?”

“Yes, I did,” I said, “Now who is this?”

“There will be another today,” she said, “Unless…”

“Who the fuck are you?” I insisted.

“Do you want your wife to find out about the girl you left to die?” they asked, “The one you killed?”

I leaned in closer to the wall, “Don’t you dare.”

“$20,000 is all I ask for,” they said.

“What?”

“Meet me at Carl’s Diner in the city at 4:00pm with the money,” they said, “Don’t be late.”

They hung up.

I arrived at the diner at 3:30pm. The person on the phone didn’t show up until 4:00pm exactly. I didn’t recognize them. They could’ve been any random person off the street. How they knew alluded me.

They carefully sat down opposite me.

“You got the money?” they said.

I gestured to the duffle bag, “All there.”

“Good,” they opened the bag and rifled through the notes for 10 seconds.

I looked them up and down looking for anything remarkable. Other than a small scar on their right hand, there was nothing.

“That’ll do it,” they made to leave the diner.

“Hey,” I said, “What about our deal?”

“Oh,” they turned around, “I already handed your wife everything before coming here. It’s out of my hands now.”

They walked away without another word.

“Hey!” I called, “Stop!”

I shot out of my seat only to trip from my weak leg. The impact on the ground took the little breath I could muster out of my decaying lungs. By the time the waitress and a random bystander got me to my feet, the mysterious person was long gone.

It took me a while to return home that night. Mainly from circling the neighborhood a few times. By the time I pulled up, it was already dark.

I found Sarah at the dinner table again. Her eyes were damp and swollen. There were documents on the table again. This time the images were graphic.

“What did you do?” she asked.

I told her.

Emma required medical help out of state.

The protection we used had failed.

I couldn’t risk it.

She begged me.

I said I’d help her.

Do it myself.

She said I couldn’t.

That I’m not that kind of doctor.

I said I’m good at removing things discretely.

Said I’m her only shot.

Said it was all I could do.

She agreed.

We met out in the woods.

She was anxious.

I was too.

I gave her some whiskey to ease the nerves.

I drank some too.

I went in slow.

Everything was going fine.

Until it wasn’t.

Blood pooled out.

A lot of it.

There was nothing I could do.

I panicked.

Too far for a hospital.

She begged me.

There was nothing I could do.

I left her.

Sarah left me.

Now I’m alone.
