“Alright, listen up,” Sean called out, slapping his palms against the nearest cubicle wall with a sharp *thwack*. His tie was loose, and his shirt sleeves were rolled up to his elbows.

“Management says we’re behind on the quarterly projections,” he continued, dragging out the word ‘management’ like it physically hurt him. “So congratulations, we’ve won a glamorous evening of spreadsheets, client calls, and whatever’s left of the coffee in the breakroom.”

“Fantastic,” Mia muttered from her desk, propping her chin on her hand. She twirled a pen absently, her brown hair pulled back in a messy ponytail. “Just what I wanted for Christmas.”

“At least we’ll be celebrating together,” Ryan added, flashing one of his trademark grins. He had perched himself on the edge of my desk, fiddling with his perfectly knotted tie.

I glanced at the clock. 8:47 p.m. The big digital numbers were glowing red against the off-white walls. I sighed, letting my eyes wander towards the window. Just outside, the city was a beautiful blur of frost-covered buildings and blinking traffic lights. Snowflakes were gently tapping against the glass.

Sophia spoke up. “Are we seriously doing this?” She was leaning back in her chair with her arms crossed, her dark eyeliner smudged slightly from rubbing her eyes. “Didn’t they just push this deadline up *again* last week?”

“Corporate wants what corporate wants,” Sean replied, throwing up his hands in surrender. “And we don’t really get a vote on it.”

“Speak for yourself,” Arjun piped up from a nearby cubicle. “I’ve got tickets to the Packers game tomorrow. No chance I’m staying late and missing it.”

“Dream big, Arjun,” Mia teased, her lips quirking up into a half-smile. “We’ll be lucky if we get out of here before midnight.”

Behind me, the printer sputtered to life with a mechanical *whirr-click*. It began spitting out pages slowly, as if it was resentful for the extra work. I grabbed the fresh stack of hot paper, thumbing through them before handing them off to Sofia.

I yawned and returned back to my desk.

“You’re quiet tonight,” Ryan said, nudging me softly with his elbow. “You good?”

“Just tired,” I replied, my voice heavier than I intended. “Feels like we’ve already been here forever.”

“Because we have,” Mia said, standing up to stretch. Her chair slid away in protest. “Seriously, what time is it? Is it still Monday?"

“It’s Tuesday,” Sean called out without looking up from his laptop. “Welcome to the future.”

By 9:30, the breakroom was running low on coffee, and the vending machine had officially eaten its third dollar bill of the night.

“This thing’s a scam,” muttered Daniel, kicking the vending machine with a dull *thunk*. He was the newest hire, still full of the kind of naive frustration the rest of us had long since buried. “Seriously, how is this even legal?”

“Consider it your initiation,” Sofia said, smirking. “Everyone loses money to that thing at least once.”

“Twice if you’re me,” I added, earning a laugh from Mia.

*SKRRRR-CHUNK*.

The sound of the printer jamming brought all of our conversations to a halt. We all turned to look at it, as if we were expecting it to apologize for the interruption.

Sean sighed dramatically and pushed back his chair. “Of course. Of course, it jams now. Why not?” He stomped over, yanking open the printer tray with a sharp *clack*. “Jeez—Who was printing *War and Peace*?”

“It was me,” Arjun admitted sheepishly, raising a hand. “Client files. They wanted physical copies of everything. I didn’t realize it was... well, that much.”

“Dude, this isn’t 1998,” Sean shot back, tugging at a crumpled wad of paper jammed deep in the machine. “Tell them to use a PDF.”

As Sean wrestled with the printer, Mia turned to me, leaning on the edge of my desk. “So,” she said, smirking, “what’s your bet? Is Sean going to fix it, or is he going to make it worse?”

“I give it five minutes before he wakes up IT,” I said, matching her smirk. 

“Hey, I heard that,” Sean called over his shoulder. “And for the record, I’m very close to fixing it.”

Just as he said it, the printer groaned loudly and spat out a mangled page covered in black streaks. Sean posed, holding it up like a trophy. “See? Progress.”

Mia shook her head. “I’m still going with ‘makes it worse.’”

The joking helped, even if only for a moment.

Just as Sean moved on to fiddling with the toner cartridge, the overhead lights flickered once, then twice. A faint *buzzing* filled the air, and everyone looked up instinctively.

“Old building,” Sofia muttered, rolling her eyes. “You’d think with the rent they charge for this place, they could afford to keep the lights on.”

“I think it adds character,” Ryan quipped. He leaned back in his chair, balancing precariously on the two rear legs. 

“Awesome,” Daniel said. “My new workplace has character.”

Within a few moments, the lights eventually steadied.

“I need some coffee,” Mia announced, “Anyone else?”

“Please,” I said. “And grab me one of those protein bars from the cabinet if there’s any left. Please and thanks.”

“I’m on it.” Mia gave a small two finger salute before heading off towards the breakroom.

Sean finally stepped back from the printer, his hands covered in black toner smudges. “Okay, we’re back in business,” he declared, pressing the power button. The machine beeped once, then twice, before spewing out a single blank page.

“Once again, progress,” Sean said with a grin.

The breakroom door creaked open, and Mia poked her head out, holding up an empty coffee pot. “Okay, who’s the monster that left this empty and didn’t start a new one?”

Sofia raised her hand. “Guilty. Sorry. I didn’t think we’d still be here this late.”

“Well, now I’m suffering for your crimes,” Mia said, disappearing back into the breakroom.

A few minutes later Mia returned, carrying a steaming mug. She tossed me a knock off multigrain bar. 

Right when I caught it, the office phone on Sean’s desk rang. We all paused, exchanging glances.

Sean frowned, picking it up. “Hello? ...Nope, no one here by that name. Wrong number.” He hung up, shaking his head. “Who even calls an office landline this late?”

“Telemarketers, probably,” Daniel offered.

“Or ghosts,” Ryan said in a mock-spooky voice, wiggling his fingers.

But the phone rang again, this time at Sofia’s desk. She stared at it for a moment before picking up. “Hello? ...What? Sorry, I think you have the wrong number.” She hung up quickly, her expression uneasy. “That was weird. Same thing, someone asking for a name I didn’t recognize.”

“Maybe it’s the client,” Arjun suggested. “They probably screwed up and sent the files to the wrong department.”

“It’s not even one of our numbers,” Sofia said, holding up the receiver. The tiny display screen showed a string of unfamiliar digits.

Sean shrugged. “Whatever. Just ignore it. They’ll figure it out eventually.”

But then another phone rang. And another. One after the other, in no discernible pattern. The shrill *RING-RING* bounced across the office like an offbeat symphony.

“Okay, this is officially creepy,” Mia said, clutching her coffee mug with both of her hands.

I glanced around the room. The phones weren’t just ringing, they were flashing with strange symbols. Random sequences of dashes and dots, like some kind of binary code.

“What the hell is that?” Sofia said, staring at her phone.

“No clue,” Sean muttered, leaning over to look at his. “Maybe IT’s running a test or something?”

“Who tests phones at ten at night?” Ryan asked.

The phones stopped ringing all at once, leaving behind the deafening sound of silence. A few moments passed with all of us just staring at each other.

Then the printer beeped again. This time, it spit out a single page. Sean walked over and grabbed it, furrowing his brow.

“What is it?” I asked.

He turned the page toward us. It was blank except for a single word printed in large, bold letters: *HELLO.*

“Okay, who’s messing with us?” Sean began waving the paper around like it was evidence in a trial. “Come on. This has an office prank written all over it.”

“Wait. Something’s... Wrong,” Arjun said, his voice unusually quiet. He was staring at his monitor, his fingers hovering above the keyboard.

“What do you mean, ‘wrong’?” Ryan asked, leaning over his desk.

“My screen just froze,” Arjun replied, gesturing at his monitor. “But it’s not like a regular crash. Look.”

We all crowded around him, peering at his screen. There wasn't an error message, but his desktop monitor had turned completely black. Every few seconds a faint, flickering static line ran across the monitor like an old television set.

“Is it the network?” Sofia asked, glancing at her own screen.

Before Arjun could answer, her computer screen blinked in response, then it followed suit. Her monitor displayed more faint, writhing static lines.

“Alright, now I’m officially freaked out,” Sofia said, backing away from her desk.

One by one, the monitors across the office started being filtered by white-noise and static lines.

“Seriously, what the hell is going on?” Daniel’s voice cracked.

“Power surge, maybe?” Mia suggested, though she didn’t sound convinced.

“Power’s still on,” Sean pointed out. “The lights are fine. This feels more like... I don’t know. A hack?”

“Who would hack *us*?” Ryan said, looking incredulous. “We’re not exactly high rollers.”

“Okay, I don’t care what anyone says,” Daniel muttered, grabbing his bag. “I’m out. This is too weird.”

“Sit down,” Sean snapped, his frustration flaring. “You can’t just bail. We still have to finish this project.”

“Finish?” Daniel gestured around the room. “The computers are fried. How exactly are we supposed to finish anything?”

Sean opened his mouth to argue, but the words caught in his throat. He looked toward the far side of the office, his expression shifting from irritation to confusion.

“Wait, where’s the exit?” Sean asked, his voice soft.

“What do you mean, ‘where’s the exit’?” Mia said, turning to look.

The glass doors leading to the elevators and stairwell were gone. In their place was a smooth, featureless wall that blended seamlessly with the rest of the office.

“No way,” I whispered, standing up and walking toward where the doors should have been. My fingers brushed against the wall. “This can’t be right.”

“Let's check out the emergency exit,” Sean said, his tone soft, nearly silent.

We wandered toward the red-lit EXIT sign in the corner, but when we reached it, the door beneath it was gone too. Just another seamless wall.

“What the actual hell is happening?” Mia asked.

Sean pounded on the wall where the door should have been. *Thud. Thud. Thud.* The sound was dull with no indication there was any empty space behind it.

“The windows,” Sofia murmured, her eyes scanning the office. “There should be windows here. Where are the windows?”

She was right. The large windows that normally lined the east side of the office were gone, replaced by more of that smooth, featureless surface.

“Okay, deep breaths,” Ryan said, holding up his hands. “Let’s not jump to conclusions. There’s got to be an explanation for this.”

“Yeah? Like what?” Daniel shot back.

The room felt colder, the faint hum of the AC now joined by an occasional *crackle*, like static electricity building in the air.

I walked back to my desk, instinctively reaching for my phone. It was dead, the screen just as black as the monitors.

“Anyone else’s phone working?” I asked.

A chorus of murmurs followed as everyone checked their devices. Nothing. No power, no signal, just dead.

“This doesn’t make sense,” Arjun muttered, “Buildings don’t just... change.”

“We need to stay calm,” Ryan said, though his voice wavered slightly. “Like I said, there’s got to be a logical explanation. Maybe it’s–”

“It’s what?” Mia asked, incredulous. “Ryan, we’ve worked here for three years. The walls don’t just—”

*BZZZZZZZRRRT.*

The sound ripped through the air like a live wire, making us all jump. It came from the printer again. Slowly, we all turned to look.

The top tray sputtered out a fresh page, crisp and white. Sean hesitated, then stepped forward to grab it. His face went pale as he read the single word printed on it:

*STAY.*

For a long moment, no one moved. Then the lights flickered again, plunging the room into brief darkness before snapping back on.

“Okay,” Sean said. “Somethings wrong.”

“Is this some kind of joke?” Sofia broke the silence, her voice tight. “Who’s doing this?”

“Nobody’s doing it,” Mia said, pacing. “You saw what happened to the doors, to the windows. That isn’t... it’s not possible.”

“Yeah? Well, it feels pretty damn real to me,” Daniel snapped, slinging his bag over his shoulder. “I’m not waiting around to find out what happens next.”

“Where are you going?” Ryan asked, stepping in front of him.

Daniel hesitated, the weight of Ryan's words settling in. He glanced around the office, the oppressive silence broken only by the occasional *tick-tick-tick* of an analogue clock pressed somewhere against the far wall.

“Then what do we do?” he asked, his voice softer.

“We stay calm,” Ryan said, though his eyes betrayed him. “We figure this out together.”

A sudden metallic *clang* echoed from somewhere deep within the office.

“Did you hear that?” Sofia whispered.

“Yeah,” I said, my throat dry. “It sounded like it came from the conference room.”

Sean grabbed a heavy stapler off a desk. “Alright, stay here. I’ll check it out.”

“You’re not going alone,” Mia said firmly, picking up a large paperweight.

“Fine,” Sean said, glancing around. “Anyone else?”

Ryan and I exchanged a look before stepping forward. “Strength in numbers, right?” Ryan said, forcing a weak smile.

The four of us moved cautiously toward the conference room, our footsteps muffled by the cheap carpet. Sean reached the door first and pushed it open with the stapler. The door swung inward with a low *creak*.

“Anything?” Mia whispered.

Sean stepped inside, squinting in the dim light. He tried to flip the light switch but nothing happened. “I don’t—”

The overhead projector flickered to life with a *pop*, casting a faint blue glow across the room. Static filled the screen, accompanied by the familiar high-pitched *whine* of an old tape spinning.

“What the hell?” Sean muttered, looking towards the projection.

The static on the screen resolved into a grainy image of a man sitting at a desk. He was dressed in 1970s office attire, his wide tie crooked, his hair disheveled. His hands were trembling as he typed on a clunky typewriter. His face was pale and drawn, dark circles hollowing his eyes. On the desk beside him, a bottle of pills lay spilled, its contents scattered.

We watched in horrified silence as the man reached for the bottle, his movements sluggish. He hesitated, his fingers trembling, before tipping the pills into his hand. The image froze as he raised them to his mouth.

“Was that...” Ryan began, but his voice trailed off.

The screen flickered again, and a new image appeared: a woman wearing an 80s suit, it rested stark against her petite frame. She was sitting in the breakroom, her head in her hands. A cup of coffee sat untouched in front of her, the steam curling upward. As the camera zoomed in, we saw her tears streaking her heavily rouged cheeks. She stood suddenly, opened the cabinet, and retrieved a bottle of cleaning chemicals. The screen froze as she unscrewed the cap.

“Oh my God,” Mia whispered, covering her mouth.

The projector clicked again, this time showing a man the office knew. John Stevens. His desk was cluttered with energy drink cans and takeout containers. He stared blankly at a glowing monitor, the bags under his eyes almost purple. He raised a box cutter, his hands shaking, and pressed it to his wrist. The screen froze just as the blade bit into his skin.

“These... these are people who worked here,” Sofia mumbled. “I knew John. Our office was closed for a while week after he…”

The projector whined, the images blurring together before the final one appeared. It was the office as we knew it, but something moved at the far end of the room.

It took everything we had to see through the grainy footage. But the thing was tall, skeletal. Its translucent, grayish skin stretched tightly over a warped, angular frame. 

The static shifted and we could see its torso. There was what looked like an exposed ribcage, wrapped in glowing wires that sparked and hissed. 

Eventually the figure began to studder forward, and as it got closer to the camera we could make out its face. Or lack thereof.

It's head resembled a warped, featureless monitor, with a jagged vertical crack down the center that pulsed with a sporadic green light.

“What the hell is that?” Ryan whispered.

The creature tilted its head toward the camera as if it had heard him. The crack in its head widened to reveal jagged, oily protrusions that looked like broken typewriter keys. 

“Turn the projector off!” Sofia shouted.

Sean ran over to the device, slamming his hand against the buttons, but the footage kept rolling. 

The screen erupted into a kaleidoscope of broken images: dead-eyed employees, tired hands fumbling with nooses, guns being loaded, razors being raised. And just as the dozens of workers were about to complete their show for us, everything stopped. 

The projector shut off with a loud *pop*, plunging the room into complete darkness.

“Step outside” Sean muttered. We listened and left the conference room.

“What happened?” Daniel asked.

Mia opened her mouth but before she could say anything, the sound of distant typewriter keys filled the room: *click-clack, click-clack*. It was joined by the rhythmic beeping of a fax machine. 

We turned as one, our eyes drawn to the far end of the office. 

What we saw is hard to explain. The air had hummed and whirred. The empty space was contorting around itself and sucking in the nearby oxygen, creating a visible distortion in the room.

Then, within that whirling mass, a form began to flicker. Its presence warped the air around it, spreading an awful scent of burning plastic.

Then it stepped out. It was the same thing from the projector screen.

Four long arms ending in needle-like fingers clicked together, gripping the nearby carpet around it as it pulled itself forward. Black ink dripped from its clawed hand with every lurch.

“What do we do?” Sofia murmured.

The creature tilted its head toward us, the green light in its facial crevice flickering brighter as it fully manifested. 

Then it opened its jagged mouth and spoke a single word in a distorted, metallic voice:

*“Work.”*

The creature then lurched forward with a horrific screech, its limbs jerking like a camera flash. The ink trailing behind it hissed and bubbled, spreading across the carpet.

Sofia screamed and bolted, running toward the breakroom.

“Wait!” Sean shouted, but it was too late. The creature twisted unnaturally, its segmented arm snapping forward like a whip. The claws at the end of its hand clamped around Sofia’s shoulder with a sickening *crunch*. Her scream turned into a strangled gurgle as the creature yanked her off her feet and dragged her toward the nearest desk.

“Oh my God,” Ryan gasped, stumbling backward. 

The creature slammed Sofia onto the desk with a bone-rattling *thud*, scattering pens and papers everywhere. One clawed hand held her down while the other reached for the computer tower beside her. 

The green light in its head flared brighter as it jammed its claws into the machine, ripping out cables and circuit boards with unfettered precision.

“Please!” Sofia sobbed, thrashing against its grip. “Help me!”

The creature ignored her. With a grinding mechanical *whirr*, it plunged the jagged wires into Sofia’s chest. Blood sprayed across the desk as she screamed, her back arching in agony. The wires pulsed and twisted, snaking their way under her skin. Her fingers clawed at the air, twitching as her body convulsed violently.

“Do something!” Mia cried, tears streaming down her face.

“I—” Sean stammered, still clutching the stapler in his trembling hands. “I don’t—”

Sofia’s screams stopped abruptly. Her body went limp, her eyes wide and glassy. For a moment, I thought she was dead. But then the thing let her go.

After a few seconds her body began sputtering. Her movements were stiff and jerky, her head lulled unnaturally to the side and looked at us. Her mouth opened, and a garbled, static laden voice emerged: “Stay with us.”

“No,” Mia whispered, backing away. “Oh my God, no.”

The creature turned toward the group, the green light in its head flickering rapidly. Sofia—if it was still Sofia—stood up beside it, her movements eerily synchronized with the creature’s. The cables and wires from the computer tower were sparking faintly from her chest as she stepped forward.

“Run!” Sean shouted, grabbing Mia’s arm and pulling her toward the nearest cubicle.

The office descended into chaos. People scattered in every direction. Arjun was the only one left frozen in place.

The creature saw him and let out another piercing screech, its claws whipping through the air as it lurched forward. Arjun tried to duck, but the creature’s claw caught his leg, sending him sprawling onto the floor. “Help!” he cried, clawing at the carpet as the creature dragged him backward.

“No!” Ryan shouted, grabbing a chair and hurling it at the creature. It hit the thing’s angular head with a loud *clang*, but the creature didn’t even seem to notice. Its claws dug into Arjun’s torso, lifting him off the ground as if he weighed nothing. It slammed him onto a desk and began tearing apart another computer.

We didn’t wait to see what happened next. Sean, Mia, Ryan, and I ducked behind a row of cubicles. “What do we do?” Mia whispered, her voice trembling. “We can’t just leave them!”

“We can’t fight that thing!” Sean hissed. 

“We can’t just—” Mia’s voice broke as Arjun’s screams echoed through the office, followed by a grotesque *squelch* as his flesh began to be rearranged.

I peeked over the edge of the cubicle. I saw the creature's claws move with mechanical focus as it fused Arjun’s body to the shattered remains of a monitor. Blood dripped onto the desk, pooling around the tangled mess of cables and broken glass. Arjun’s head twitched violently, his eyes rolling back into his skull. When his mouth opened, a distorted voice spilled out: “Stay.”

I ducked back down, my stomach churning. “It’s—”

A loud *bang* cut me off. We all turned toward the sound. Daniel had grabbed a fire extinguisher and was swinging it wildly. “Come on, you son of a bitch!” he screamed, his voice cracking with desperation.

The creature snapped its head towards the young man, its crack flaring open exposing its gnarled teeth-like protrusions. It moved fast, its clawed hand slicing through the air with a sharp *whoosh*. Daniel’s voice was cut short as the claws tore through his side.

“Move” Sean pleaded, shoving us toward the far side of the office. “We need to keep moving.”

We scrambled over overturned chairs and scattered papers, the sounds of the creature’s claws tearing through flesh echoed behind us.

As we rounded a corner, I took one final glance back. The creature stood in the center of the office, its ink-stained claws dripping as it loomed over Daniel’s lifeless body. The twisted forms of Sofia and Arjun flanked it, their movements stiff and unnatural, their mouths repeating the same garbled phrase: “Stay. Stay. Stay.”

I refocused on my friends, our hearts pounding as we pressed forward. 

“This way,” Sean barked, leading us toward the far side of the conference rooms. 

“We can’t keep running” Mia cried, clutching her side.

Sean skidded to a stop. He looked almost feral, but when he saw Mia his face softened. “You're right. You guys keep moving down the hallway.”

“What are you talking about?” Ryan snapped. 

“I’m not saying I’ll fight it,” Sean said, his voice low,  “But I’ll lead it away. You three—find another way out. There’s gotta be something.”

“No!” Mia shouted, grabbing his arm. “We’re not splitting up! That’s insane!”

Sean pried her hand off. “Listen to me. We don’t all get out of this unless someone slows it down. I can do that. I'll put my old track star talent to some good use.”

“Sean, don’t—” I started, but the words died in my throat as a piercing *screech* cut through the air. The creature rounded the far corner, its warped form illuminated by the green flicker of its head.

“Go!” Sean shouted, shoving Ryan toward the next hallway. “Now!”

“Sean!” Mia screamed, tears streaming down her face as Ryan dragged her away.

I hesitated, torn between running and staying, but Sean gave me one last look—a mix of fear and determination. “Go!” he yelled again, louder this time.

I turned and bolted after Ryan and Mia, my chest tight with guilt. Behind us, Sean picked up a chair and hurled it at the creature with a feral yell. The chair shattered against its angular head with a *clang*, and for a moment, I dared to hope it worked. I heard him sprint away.

But then came his scream—a raw, guttural sound.

We somehow stumbled into the breakroom, slamming the door shut behind us. Ryan jammed a chair under the handle. Mia collapsed onto the floor, sobbing into her hands.

“What now?” Ryan asked, “What the hell do we do now?”

I looked over the room. There, at the far wall, was something we hadn’t seen yet: a window.

“Is that real?” I asked.

“I think so,” Ryan said. “It’s a way out.”

The glass was large and covered in frost, the city lights beyond filtered into the room. For a moment, hope flickered in my chest.

“What if it’s another trick?” Mia asked, her voice tinged with panic. “What if we jump and it just—”

The creature’s mechanical screech echoed through the hallway we had just left, I could already hear the metallic grind of its movements lurching closer.

“We don’t have time to argue,” Ryan said. He grabbed a chair and hurled it at the window. The glass shattered with a deafening crash. Shards of the window pane scattered across the floor and glittered like ice in the dim light. 

A rush of cold air overtook the room, sharp and biting, but it felt real. It felt freeing.

“Go on.” Ryan shouted, pushing Mia forward. 

Mia hesitated for only a second before climbing onto the windowsill. The wind whipped through her hair as she looked back at us, tears streaming down her face. “Are you sure this is—”

“Just go!” Ryan yelled. “We’ll be right behind you.”

One by one, we climbed onto the sill. The city stretched out below us, impossibly far away. We looked for any type of fire ladder, but the building was flat. The fall down would be fatal for us. 

We heard the door in the office shatter. It was quickly approaching the broken window.

“Together,” Ryan said, his voice steady despite the fear in his eyes. “We jump together.”

Without another word, we leapt. 

The cold air rushed past us as we plummeted, the wind tearing at our clothes and filling our ears with a deafening roar. The ground rose up to meet us, faster and faster, and just as we were about to hit—

I woke up.

I was back at my desk. Everything was pristine, untouched. The lights were steady, the air quiet.

I blinked, disoriented. Papers sat neatly stacked beside my keyboard, untouched. My computer screen was on, displaying a spreadsheet I didn’t remember opening. The digital clock had 8:47 p.m. displayed. 

I heard a gasp. “Mia?” I whispered, turning to her.

She was at her desk, her tear-streaked face lit by the glow of her monitor. “I... I don’t understand,” she said, her voice hollow. “Was it a dream?”

Ryan sat a few desks over, staring blankly at his screen. “It felt real,” he muttered. “It was real. I know it was.”

We exchanged uneasy glances, each of us struggling to process what had happened—or hadn’t happened. But the longer we sat there, the more the mundanity of the office crept back in. The steady hum of the HVAC system. The faint *tap-tap* of a keyboard. The familiar glow of fluorescent lights.

I wanted to say something, but my body moved on autopilot. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my mind blank.

The silence was broken by Mia’s chair creaking as she shifted. “We should... we should get back to work,” she said softly, almost to herself.

I opened my mouth to argue but found no words. Mia sniffled, wiping her eyes. Her fingers trembled as she began typing. Ryan followed, his keyboard clacking steadily.

I stared at my screen, my reflection distorted in the monitor’s glass. The green glow of a spreadsheet flickered slightly, almost imperceptibly.

In the corner of my eye, something moved—a faint shadow, like the flicker of static. I turned, but nothing was there.

I placed my hands on the keyboard and began to type.
