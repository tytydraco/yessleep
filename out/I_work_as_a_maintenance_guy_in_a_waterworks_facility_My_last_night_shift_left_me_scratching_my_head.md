I work in a waterworks facility in Ni≈°, Serbia as a maintenance guy. My job mostly loops around crawling inside pipes and vents to remove blockages, as well as making sure that the water filtering system works as it should. I have 2 shifts that change every day. A day shift and a night shift.
There is also another guy with the same job as mine, but he works when i don't. (If i work the day shift he works the night shift and vice versa)
During the night shift there are only 5 personel in the facility, since the system functions basically by itself, and there are 3 people to be there just in case there is a malfunction, me to fix that malfunction, and a security guard.

Yesterday i came to the facility just in time for the night shift and everyone that works the day shift. I got into the building and put on my work suit. It literally passed like about 10 minutes and one of the pipes immediately got clogged. To make matters even worse it was at the lower levels, which meant that it will be a lot colder than if it was on the high or ground levels. 

But, it was either that or inability to afford food, so i didn't have much choice. I crawled into the maintenance passage and made my way to the clogged pipe. The sight of clumped up junk with the junk juice dripping out of it really isn't a pretty scene to look at, as you can guess. I impaled the clump with my cleaning tool and it dissolved into the water and went to the filters.
I was making my way out of the pipe when i heard (in my native language) 
"GAHHH WHAT THE FUCK?!"

I recognized that voice, it was the security guard, my friend, Jovan.
I crawled out of the pipe and ran to him.
He was in the main lobby and had a tight grip on his gun. He was pointing it to the glass exit door.
I asked him what's wrong and he said "Look at the door.". I looked at the door and i saw, something, i saw something, alright. 

It was leaning on the locked door like a dog waiting for his owner to get out of the house, but it was far from a dog, at least i think so. It had black fur, and it was so skinny that it looked like it's bones could crush under their own weight, it had jade green eyes and the head shaped like that of a dog's, but humanoid arms with skinny, short, fingers that were pressing onto the glass with mild force.

I was trying to think of an explanation, what it could be, when i heard: 

"Please.. let me in... it's cold....."

It was coming from the creature, it sounded like there was no air in its lungs and that it barely managed to even say that.

Then Jovan yelled out "Who are you?! This is a restricted area!"

The creature was silent for a moment, it tapped on the windows 4 times, and then said, in the same way as before "Please... I'm dying...."

Jovan visibly got more agitated, and shouted "GET OUT OF HERE OR I'LL SHOOT!" with even more loudness in his voice than before.

The creature recoiled in surprise and fear, before nonchalantly but alertly crawling off out of sight.

Keep in mind that the exit door, where the creature was, was perfectly lit, and we could see it perfectly. When it spoke, it didn't move it's mouth at all. It just kept staring at us with the look of apathy in its eyes. It's voice was audible but there was no movement from the thing. 

By the time the thing ran off the other 3 workers rushed to the lobby we were in. And asked what happened. 

Me and Jovan couldn't say at the moment, we were frozen in fear.

Jovan suddenly regained confidence and tried to sound chill, and told them what happened.
We decided to call our manager and tell him what visited us.
He told us to call him and the cops if it came again.

It never did, at least not at work.

Jovan told me today that he saw it again in his frontyard when he returned home. As soon as he got out of his car and the thing saw him, it screamed (if you can call it screaming) and ran off into the nearby forest. 

I would upload the camera footage but i don't have access to them, once again, i am only a maintenance worker, and Jovan can't give it to me since he isn't allowed to distribute camera footage.

I will update you if it returns again. And i will try to get a fotograph or a video of it.
That's all for now, i guess.
