The weirdest thing is happening in Los Angeles and I don’t know who else to go to without being looked at as if I’m crazy. So here goes, Reddit.  
  
I was driving from class to work on Monday. There was traffic on the 405, which is obviously a normal thing in this city, and I was jamming out to music as I finally made it to my off ramp. As I belted out some Sabrina Carpenter and waited for the light to turn green, I looked at the Prius in front of me and the driver was staring at me in his side mirror with the biggest grin on his face. I'm not famous and didn’t think I was being that ridiculous with my jam session so I don’t see a reason for the direct prolonged stare. I don’t know, maybe I was extra ridiculous or perhaps that guy’s coffee just kicked in? But the light changed and everyone (including him) started driving. But Mr. Prius never looked away from me via his side mirror and never stopped smiling. Actually, now that I’m thinking about it more, I don’t know if he blinked. Whatever was going on, I stopped singing and focused on getting away from him. I moved lanes, then he moved lanes to resume being in front of me again, grinning and staring. Eventually he made a right turn and I continued straight, but he never stopped watching me.  
  
It was capital W, Weird. But this is a big city and people are strange. I shook it off, eventually. My commute home was uneventful, though my head was on a swivel the entire time.  
  
Tuesday he was there again, long before the exit ramp. Silver Prius, strange man grinning and staring in his side mirror at me. I moved to the right, switching lanes as soon as I registered who it was. He switched too. I moved back to the left lane and pulled some moves I am not proud of to get around him. This is a city of nearly 4 million people and we were on one of the busiest freeways in the world; even if we have similar commute schedules it is odd to really notice the same car twice. Especially if that car is a silver Prius. Regardless, I got myself away from him. Except in the car I was behind now (also a silver Prius), the driver was staring at me through the rearview mirror and grinning that unblinking grin just like Mr Prius 1. It was not the same person (\*yeah, of course it wasn’t, OP, it’s a different car.\* But I’ve seen strange things on this subreddit so I wanted to clarify). After a mile of this, two more lane changes from myself and equal countering moves from Madam Second Prius to stay in front of me, and them never looking away, I took the next exit and used surface streets to get to work. Once again, my commute home was uneventful.

Today (Wednesday) really ramped up. On my way to work I counted no fewer than 14 silver Priuses with drivers staring directly at me through mirrors. Never straight on. Always through a mirror and always with a wide grin. I called my partner and talked to her until I made it into my office because I was so unsettled. This time none of them changed lanes with me when I maneuvered, but no matter what I did, I found myself behind another Prius with another grinning driver who never looked away from me.  
  
I counted 22 on my commute home.  
  
When I got to my ground floor apartment, I poured a whiskey. I don’t normally drink during the week but it was my indoor version of touching grass. I needed something, anything to ground me. My girlfriend called me right after I poured it about 20 minutes ago though, so I haven’t gotten a sip in. We don’t have a parking garage or lot at our place and she said the entire street is lined with silver Priuses, except for my old blue Toyota Camry. She can’t find anywhere to park.  
  
Redditors, I am terrified. I opened the blinds to look out and every Prius has a driver in it grinning at me through their mirrors. I can’t see anyone directly as every one of these 30 cars is parked in just such a way that the driver is blocked from view. But I can see them all through the side mirrors and every one of them is widely grinning while they stare at me. Even the cars that would logically be facing me have parked with their trunks to the apartment, on the wrong side of the road if you will, and are watching through the side mirrors. I don’t even know if its legal to park like that here.  
  
I just realized I can’t hear any birds or any traffic or any neighbor’s conversations. The AC hasn't kicked on since I got home. The refrigerator hasn't rattled once. The last sound I heard was my girlfriend’s voice 20 minutes ago. At least the last words were “I’ll be home soon. Well, as soon as I walk from wherever I find to park my car. I love you.”  
  
Wait. That was a car door slamming. No that was thirty car doors closing.
