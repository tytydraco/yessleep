Audrey and I weren't exactly close friends. I mean sure we'd shared a couple of classes last year, chatted a bit since we were stuck next to each other in geometry, but it wasn't much more. This year we were lab partners in Dr. Karper’s class so we exchanged numbers but the conversation hadn't extended further than “Hi” and “Is this Audrey?” followed by “Yup” and “Cool”.

Something odd happened last Tuesday, however. I was at work, bored out of my mind behind the counter. I was watching two of my classmates, completely baked, trying to pump gas. I was just waiting for them to realize the large “OUT OF ORDER” sign over the screen on the machine. Just as the one kid pointed up to the piece of copy paper we'd put up on the pump hours before, I felt a buzzing in my pocket.

Of course I knew it was my phone but considering my boss was working the night shift with me, I didn't want to take any chances. My parents would've killed me if I'd lost this job. In my head it was probably just a scam call anyway. I didn't have anyone I knew who would call me after 11pm on a Tuesday. 

I didn’t check my messages until I got home that night. I threw my work vest on my bed and shut the door behind me, collapsing into my desk chair as I did almost every night these days. I pulled my phone from my pocket and swiped through all the notifications I’d missed. Most of it was the same garbage my friends would always send but there was one that caught my eye. A new voice message from Audrey. I had to double take, honestly a little taken aback. We didn’t have any homework due, no project that needed discussion either. Essentially, unless she had somehow fallen in love with me that night and had to confess her feelings, she had no reason to be calling me at 11:16pm. And considering she already was dating somebody, I could safely rule that theory out.

Swiping away my friend's usual junk messages, I immediately went to call back Audrey, quickly jumping to the conclusion that I'd forgotten some school assignment we were supposed to do that night. The phone rang and I impatiently tapped my foot, leaning back on my desk as I waited for her to answer. She never did. I'll admit now it was extremely unlike her but in my own exhaustion from a long, tedious night at work, I didn't think enough of it and collapsed into my bed. I didn't think of a lot that night. Most importantly, I didn't think of listening to the message Audrey had left me.

When I woke up that morning, it wasn’t from the beep of my alarm clock or my mom’s incessant knocking. It was chilled air seeping through my bedroom window. I rolled up in a ball, trying to grasp whatever warmth I could from my bedsheet and blanket but to no avail. I didn’t realize where the cold breeze was coming from, begrudgingly sitting up to try to investigate. It was still dark, the moonlight shining in through the window. My eyes locked onto the window across the room from me. It was wide open, the curtains gently swaying from the draft that had been flowing in. 

I stared at it, puzzled. I almost never opened that window. In fact in my entire life, I could only recall two moments that window was ever opened. One was when I thought my Lego airplane could fly. The other was when I tried handing my dad lemonade as he was power washing the house. Neither ended very well. I cautiously stepped out of my bed, swinging both my legs out and begrudgingly standing up. I yawned as I shuffled over to the window. I examined the frame, the glass, the lock, anything that could have somehow let the incessant late autumn air into my room and disturbed my sleep. I shut the window, sliding the lock into place having failed to find the culprit. I jostled it a couple times to ensure it was secure before swinging around head back to bed. As I did so, something caught the corner of my eyes.

It took a few moments for my eyes to adjust to the darkness that enveloped the majority of my room but I could clearly make out a figure on the futon across from my desk. I froze in my tracks, my mind immediately jumping into fight or flight mode. My heart started to race as I tried to think of what the hell I was even going to do. My phone was still in my bed, if I tried opening the bedroom door it would make too much noise. I couldn’t even tell if they were awake, it was too dark to tell. They could have been staring right at me, spotlighted by the moonlight coming from the window. Then the figure shifted, sitting upright and seemingly wiping its face. It sniffed and snorted, as if it had been crying. Then it spoke.

“I-I’m sorry Charlie. I… I didn’t want to wake you up but… I didn’t know where else to go. I was scared. I-I am scared.” The voice said.

I knew the voice anywhere. It was Audrey. I never thought that Audrey Sheppard would be in my room, let alone be sleeping on my futon. We had a pretty platonic relationship and again, she had a boyfriend so even if either of us wanted more it would make things… ugly. But here she was, sad and scared. She looked awful. Her hair was a mess and it seemed she had scraped her arms climbing in through the window. She had dried tears down her cheeks and her eyes were tired and washed out. I switched on my desk lamp and immediately went to her side.

“W-what the hell happened?” I asked. She put her head in her hands and tried to hold back tears.

“My dad… s-someone took my dad…”

“Wait what? A-are you serious?” I asked, finding her statement a little hard to believe. Audrey had always been a pretty grounded person. In our boredom during geometry, there would be more than a few times we’d discuss hypotheticals to try to pass the time. I generally would think of the more far fetched answers and Audrey tended to be more realistic with hers. She always seemed to ruin my fun. With that in mind, I immediately knew she was in fact serious.

“Y-y-yeah… I-I mean… I could hear everything. He sounded… he sounded so scared.”

“Alright listen I’m sure there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation for whatever happened. M-maybe you’re mom-”

“She had nothing to do with this.” Audrey snapped, shutting down my suggestion quickly. She took a deep breath. “Besides, I didn’t see a car.”

“Then who the hell was it?” I questioned. Audrey hesitated. 

“Well it… it looked like a man was in the hallway. I-I never saw him, just his shadow against the wall. The lights were off anyway. I-I was so scared Charlie. I couldn’t move. I didn’t move, not for an hour maybe. That’s when I called you.”

“And of course I was stuck at work with Roger all night. Fuck I wish I answered that call now.”

“I-it’s ok, really. I mean it’s not like our calls have really ever been about something fun.. o-or important honestly.” She tried to break a smile. “It’s always complaining about Dr. Karper while struggling with chem assignments. I’m not sure I’d risk my job just to hear that.”

“Hey come on, those conversations are fun in their own right.” I argued, trying to lighten the mood a little. She broke a smile for a moment and shrugged.

“I guess so.” Audrey admitted. 

“C-can I ask um…” I paused, questioning whether I should ask what had come to mind. “Why didn’t you call the police? O-or anybody else, honestly.”

Her face quickly sank back into reality, the fear returning to her eyes.

“The cops… they told me to call back if he didn’t show up in 48 hours. Two whole days. Said they can’t file a missing person’s report before that time period had been reached. A-and who else would even believe me? Carl is a great guy and all but I honestly think he’d call me crazy if I told him everything that happened.”

“Audrey, you haven’t even told me everything… I mean what exactly did you hear?”

She didn’t respond, just staring at me with her sorrowful blue eyes. She looked down, playing with her fingers for a moment before letting out a sigh.

“I-it started with the crying. I-I could hear him sobbing. Then… I heard him dragged… out of bed, fucking violently down the stairs…” She paused, trying to contain herself. “F-fuck sorry I um…”

“Hey listen it’s alright, we can just wait until the morning if you-”

“N-no it’s ok.” She took a deep breath. “I could hear every single hit his head took on every single stair. I-It’s like it was intentional… I-I even counted our staircase afterward. 15 steps. 15 bumps. And when he reached the bottom… I heard a crack. T-then… then a scream. He was slid across the wood floor and outside. His screams became distant… so distant it was almost as if I was hearing it in my head instead of outside. I was completely frozen… I-I seriously thought it was a nightmare. The last thing I heard… it must’ve been a full minute afterward… was the door slam shut. A-and I’m telling you Charlie, it was such a strong slam it knocked pictures off the wall. T-there’s still glass at the bottom of the stairs.”

I didn’t respond, I mean honestly how could I have? What I had been told was ridiculous, it was crazy, it was insane. But this was Audrey. It wasn’t some lunatic. And we weren’t in New Hampshire State Hospital. This was Hillsborough. The only claim to fame we’d ever had was being the childhood home of Franklin Pierce. But who is anyone kidding? Nobody could even remember what number President he was. Or that he was a president at all, honestly.

“Y-you don’t believe me… I-I’m so stupid I should’ve known this was-”

“Audrey,” I interrupted her, “I… I don’t know what happened to your dad. But I know you wouldn’t lie about this. I believe you… despite how fucked up this all is.”

She quickly wrapped her arms around me in a tight hug, resting her head on my shoulder.

“You have no idea what that means to me, Charlie. T-thank you… god thank you so much.”

We both quickly realized that as the first rays of sunlight began to lighten the night sky, we’d have to go to school that morning. And because my parents wouldn’t exactly approve of a girl they’d maybe met twice staying over in my room without their knowledge, we both thought it best that we get out of the house before they even wake up. That landed us in the parking lot of Hillsborough Diner far before either of us would normally dare wake up. I gave Audrey an old sweatshirt from my closet to cover up the tears made in her t-shirt from the climb up the tree and Band-Aids for the numerous cuts on her arms and hands. She owed us a fresh box.

Sitting down at the counter, the diner was surprisingly busy for six in the morning on a Wednesday. It was mainly commuters, naturally. Most were just grabbing a cup of coffee or a quick meal before heading to the bus stop down the street or jumping on 202. The waitress, a young woman probably in her mid twenties handed us menus with a peppy smile.	

“You guys are up pretty early, school doesn’t start for another hour or so if I remember right. Pull an all nighter for a project?” She asked. Audrey and I exchanged exhausted looks, turning back to the waitress and simply nodding. It wasn’t worth it to even attempt explaining our night. She laughed.	

“Well you look like zombies, no offense. So maybe I can get something to help you wake up?” She suggested, starting to pull out her pad and pen.

“I’ll just have um… some pancakes… and tea.” Audrey answered quietly.

“French omelet I guess and just uh… orange juice if you have it.” I followed. She quickly scribbled on her pad and stuffed it back into her pocket.

“Coming right up.”

We watched her walk back into the kitchen, pushing the doors open and letting them swing shut behind her. 

“I-I don’t know how I’m going to do this, Charlie.” Audrey admitted. “I can’t just pretend everything is fine.”

“I know but think about it this way… at school it might be safer.” I let out a sigh. “I never thought I’d be actually advocating to go to school but if… if there is someone or something out to get you or me or anyone, being in a bigger group would make it less likely something happens. A-and there’s more people to help if it does.”

“I guess you’re right.” She replied softly, looking down at the counter while twisting her silverware in her fingers. “I’m just scared.”

“Me too.” I admitted quietly. “I-I mean I honestly didn’t want to bring this up but um… you know what, nevermind. It’s stupid.” I quickly shut myself down. Audrey’s head shot over to face me, intrigue in her eyes.

“W-what? What didn’t you want to bring up?” She asked almost desperately.

“I-it’s nothing really. It’s du-”

“Charlie, what is it?” She cut me off, her voice stern. “I-I need to know. If it could help figure out what happened to my dad, tell me. Please.” She insisted. I didn’t immediately respond, almost scared of her reaction. She’d either think I was an idiot for suggesting it or she’d actually consider it. Either option I didn’t like the thought of.

“Well um… you moved to Hillsborough freshman year, right?” I started.

“Yeah, why?” She responded quickly, her words sharp. I hesitated to answer.

“I-if you’d grown up in town. And I mean like grown up since pre-school, kindergarten, that kind of age, you’d have heard of Hillsborough's urban legend.”

“Urban legend? What the fuck are you talking about?” 

“It’s a local story, you know. Like Bigfoot or the Mothman, jersey devil, that kind of thing.”

“Yeah I get what an urban legend is Charlie. What does it have to do with what happened to my dad?” She replied, almost annoyed at my dancing around the topic.

“N-nothing, honestly. It’s just a story.”

“Well I want to hear it. I don’t give a shit if it’s just a story.”

“Alright, alright. Jesus, it’s not even a real story. I-I don’t know if I even remember the whole thing. I probably haven’t heard it since 7th grade.”

“You totally do, come on out with it.”

“Fine,” I groaned.

Hillsborough is a boring town. I’ll be the first to admit it. But like most boring towns, the people who live there tend to try to find ways to make it interesting. To put it on the map, make a name for themselves. I’m not sure who came up with the story of the Weeping Widow but whoever they are, they were a bit messed up in the head.

During the first world war, the winter of 1917 to be more specific, a young bride of a Contoocook Cotton Mills worker got a knock on her door which she feared more than anything. Two army officers handed her a letter that her husband was dead, probably blown to pieces by an artillery shell or machine gun fire. People forget how gruesome world war one could be.

She was heartbroken, the love of her life stolen from her far too soon. Their home, isolated from town at the base of Thompson Hill, was now a prison where she would only be reminded of the world she lived in before her husband had been killed. She stopped seeing her friends, family and soon stopped leaving all together. For weeks people thought she had gone and left town along with the memories of her lost love. However, they were wrong. The widow walked from her home, now disheveled, starving and aggrieved. She walked into the center of town, uncontrollably crying with dark black stains around her eyes. Then, in broad daylight, jumped from the Hillsborough Bridge into the Contoocook River with the whole town watching.

Some people have been more brutal with the details than others, but for us as kids it was kept pretty PG. Nobody knows what happened to the body. Honestly there is no record of the event even happening. But the story became that of folk lore. A ghost story of a lost widow you could hear quietly sobbing through the woods. A feeling of being watched when walking alone on a dark empty street far later than you should be out. An angry spirit hell bent on snatching you up and dragging you down with it to steal your soul. That was the real impact of the Weeping Widow. Another monster story, meant to keep kids home in bed at night. 

Throughout the decades a few disappearances in the state forests kept the story of the Weeping Widow alive, some superstitious people attributing those very real tragedies to a ghost story. As a kid sometimes I’d think about the version of the story my mom or dad had told me, or the more graphic version I’d heard in the lunchroom at school. A sense of unease would come over me as I walked home from school. Or maybe while hiking with my friends I’d hear or see something seemingly nobody else did. But as we grew older, the story slowly lost its punch. It had gone from a terrifying tale parents used as a scare tactic to a high school bonfire story I’d heard told on more than one occasion lightheartedly. I even remember a few seniors went on a hunt one Halloween to try to get a picture of the Widow. Ultimately we all grew up, monsters weren’t real after all. 

When I’d finished telling the story, or the latest version I’d been told of it, Audrey looked at me with a bit of disbelief.

“H-how the hell have I never heard this?” She wondered, “I seriously can’t-”

“Audrey, stop” I cut her off. I let out a sigh, “It’s a story. A local folk legend. Please don’t tell me you’re actually considering this a possible explanation.” She didn’t respond, her eyes looking down at the counter almost with shame.

“I-I just want *any* explanation, Charlie.” She admitted, crossing her arms. 

“I’m sorry… so do I. But this is… this is not it. You of all people should know that.”

“I know… I know. I-it’s ridiculous.” She tried to tell herself. “Let’s just… stop talking about this right now. I don’t… I can’t think about it anymore.”

As if on queue, our waitress returned with two steaming plates of breakfast classics. We ate quickly, barely taking breaks between bites. It had felt like I’d already been up a whole day, I couldn’t even imagine how it felt for Audrey. 

After eating, we stepped out of the diner and into the crisp morning air. I dug in my pocket and pulled out my car key, the amber lights of the little gray sedan flashing as I tapped the unlock button. The car wasn’t exactly a chick magnet but it was free after all, and who turns down something that's free?

Audrey and I buckled in and I started up the engine. It puttered to life and I threw the shifter in drive. I looked over at her for a moment. She seemed deep in thought. She hadn’t said more than a few words since I told her the story of the Weeping Widow. I was worried about her. And I’d been kicking myself for even mentioning the damn legend in the first place. 

“H-hey are you alright? You haven’t spoken since we ate.” I asked, deciding to break the silence as we rounded a corner onto the aptly named School Street. 

“I uh… I’ve just been thinking about everything I guess.” She replied, still not fully present as she stared out the window.

“You’re still thinking about the Weeping Widow.” I concluded. She didn’t respond, just kept her eyes on the moving greenery outside. “We need to start thinking seriously, Audrey.”

“I’m being dead fucking serious, Charlie. What happened to my dad… I can’t fucking explain. There’s nothing, no logical explanation for why or how it happened.” She took a deep breath. “Listen, if you don’t want to keep going in this direction with me, that’s fine. But after school, I’m going to go to the library and see if there’s anything about those disappearances you mentioned. O-or about the Widow herself. Just… just anything to help.”

I swung the car into a parking spot in the student lot and slid the shifter in park. The car rested and I shut off the engine, pulling the key from the ignition. Then, I turned to face her.

“Look, I-I’m not leaving your side. You roped me into it, now you’re stuck with me. For better or for worse. I honestly doubt we’re going to find anything at the library but… who the fuck knows. Maybe I’m wrong.” I insisted. 

“R-really? You’ll come with me?” She asked, a bit of surprise and a hint of relief in her voice.

“Yeah. The fact that you came to me of all people last night for help… I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night knowing I just abandoned you when you needed my help.” I admitted. Her face brought out a small smile.

“Thanks, Charlie. That um… that means a lot.”

As we walked through the doors of Hillsboro-Deering High School, a strange feeling hung over me. Everyone was oblivious to what had happened last night. And yes, of course they would be. Neither Audrey nor I had said a word to anybody. Despite that, it still felt as thought we were hiding something. We had to pretend that everything was fine. I’d never had to fake how I acted on an everyday basis. And as the doors shut behind us, we both had to relearn to be ourselves.

“I’ll catch you in class, I-I see Carl at his locker.” Audrey told me, separating from me as she weaved through the morning rush to reach her boyfriend. Carl Pearson was Hillsborough’s future baseball team captain. He’d always been surprisingly nice, ever since we were kids. I wouldn’t say I was ever exactly friends with the guy but he wasn’t that typical athlete either. He and Audrey had started dating at the end of Freshman year and they seemed happy together. Today however, one half would be genuine while the other tried desperately to be.

I was knocked out of my own daze by Ben, one of my best friends. He’d probably tried texting me a hundred times since last night but I didn’t even bother trying to respond. 

“Charlie, what the hell dude where have you been? Didn’t you get any of my texts?” He asked with a bit of playful annoyance in his voice. It took a minute for me to answer, my mind starting to slow as the lack of sleep was finally catching up with me.

“I um… y-you know I had work, man. Roger would’ve fired me.” I tried to explain.

“Oh yeah, but what about after? Kyle and I went out to the pond last night. You missed out dude, these seniors brought a full 24 pack. It got crazy.”

I tried to crack a smile as if I was honestly interested. “I’m sure it was, I-I guess I was just really tired last night.”

“I get it dude, it's all good.” Ben assured me. “You know what was the craziest part though? We heard some actually scary noises out in the woods last night. Sounded like nothing I’ve ever heard before. Then again, I had a couple in me already.”

My eyes widened. “W-wait, what? When did you hear those sounds? Where did they come from?” I asked a little frantically, losing my cool quickly.

“I-I don’t know, man. It was kind of late.” He stopped to think for a moment. “After ten if I were to guess. Probably came from up at Thompson Hill. That’s where those rednecks live around Kimball Corner.”

I didn't want to believe it but there was no denying it was a damn perfect coincidence. My brain ran a million miles a minute as Ben looked at me a little confused.

“A-are you alright, Charlie?” He asked. “You look like you saw a ghost.”

“It’s been uh… I-I had a rough night. That’s all.” I admitted, suppressing my thoughts. He smirked.

“I saw you walk in with Audrey Sheppard this morning. What was all that about?” He asked slyly. I rolled my eyes.

“Come on man, we've already had this conversation. She just um… needed a ride this morning. Something about her dad not being able to take her.” I tried to explain. He laughed.

“Sure buddy, whatever you say. I wouldn’t want to get on Carl’s bad side either.”

I shoved him playfully, “You can be such a dick sometimes.”

“I know, I pride myself on it.” He admitted.

The school day felt longer than any other I could remember. After first period, I felt like a zombie, roaming aimlessly through the day and simply existing to fill my seat. In chemistry, Audrey and I didn’t say a word to each other the entire time. She dozed off at least three times and I was becoming dangerously close myself. Dr. Karper didn’t seem to notice as our seats were in the back row but I had designated myself as the lookout just in case. 

When the day ended, Audrey was waiting for me at my car. She yawned as she leaned against the hood, arms crossed. Her eyes were heavy and her expression tired.

“That was…” She started.

“Awful” I finished. “Do you still want to-”

“Absolutely.” She cut me off, answering before I could even finish my sentence. Without another word, we took our seats in the car. I started it up, the engine’s hum filling the cabin as we pulled back out of the parking lot and onto School Street.

The Hillsborough Library wasn’t far from the school, then again everything in town was fairly close together. Within only a few turns and a couple more minutes, we’d parked behind the old building. The library was housed in a huge old yellow Victorian, with white trim and a stone brick foundation. A sign hung from the stairs of the long wrapping porch that read “Fuller Public Library” along with a sagging banner that used to display “Book Fair” but now much of it was illegible.

The entire school day I’d been in a daze, thinking about what Ben had mentioned to me before the first bell. It had to be just a coincidence but I also had to admit, it scared me a little more than I would’ve liked. The thought of mentioning it to Audrey made me even more worried she’d completely accept that a monster had stolen her father for seemingly no reason. But despite my reservations, I knew I had to break the news to her.

“So um… after we split up this morning” I started.

“Yeah?” She replied, pushing open the tall wooden door into the library’s main lobby.

“I-I was talking to Ben and um… he was out late last night at the Pond and well” I paused. Audrey gave me a confused look. “Well he said that they heard some… sounds coming from up on Thompson Hill.” Her tired expression immediately switched.

“D-did they say what ti-”

“It was after ten. At least that was his guess. He didn’t really describe what he heard but it seemed like whatever it was really freaked him out.” I admitted.

“Charlie y-you know that almost perfectly lines up with-”

“You don’t need to remind me. I just don’t want you to jump to any conclusions. It’s weird, yes but that’s assuming that anything about a local folk story is true.” I insisted.

“I know, that’s why we’re here anyway. So um… where do you think the town records would be?” She questioned. I shrugged.

“Beats me, I haven’t been in this place since middle school. I guess we could ask somebody at the desk.” 

The lady working at the checkout desk seemed ancient, as if she had sat in that same spot for a hundred years or more. This building was her domain and she was simply giving us the privilege to roam its halls. She watched us approach without lifting her head, her eyes tracing our path as we approached her. She spoke to us in short bursts, her words quiet but being heard loud and clear. She was skeptical when we asked to see Hillsborough’s records, like we were asking to see the crown jewel of her treasure hoard. With a bit of convincing from Audrey however, the old lady reluctantly agreed to take us to the records room. 

She hobbled off her chair and grabbed a comically large ring of keys. They jingled in her hand as we slowly followed her up the stairs to the second floor of the converted mansion. Reaching a solid dark wood door, she stopped short and began fishing for the right key. With a look of satisfaction, she took an old iron key and stuck it into the lock of the door, twisting it as the door opened with a satisfying click. Instructing us to lock the door when we left, she gave the room a long scan with her eyes before leaving us alone on the second floor. 

The records room was not large, likely an old bedroom when the building had been a house. Now it was a plainly painted room littered with filing cabinets, computers and scanning machines. We split the small space in half, trying to compile as much information as we could about the town’s urban legend. To be honest, I’m not sure exactly what drove me to dig through countless files for what was starting to feel like at least an hour. Audrey’s purpose was clear but my own I couldn’t quite place. I wanted to help my friend, that was obvious enough. But I suppose my own curiosity was starting to get the best of me. And in the back of my mind, a doubt was starting to grow about how confident I was that nothing of the story was true. Perhaps I’d just told myself so many times it wasn’t real, I simply started to believe it.

We’d occasionally snatch a document from one of the drawers or save a file on the computer but much of what we found had very little to do with the Weeping Widow. Audrey compiled everything on one of the open desks, laying out the documents in a rough chronological order in record time. Sometimes I forgot how smart she was and more importantly how lucky I was to have her as a lab partner. I’d be screwed without her.

We looked over everything, trying to put together some kind of pattern. Most of the documents were old, black and white newspaper clippings long yellowed and curling in the corners. Audrey had focused on trying to find any mention of the story from 1917, the supposed date of the event itself. I was more interested in putting together the missing persons cases I remember my parents telling me about. 

There was seldom mention of the Weeping Widow by name minus a couple of opinion pieces dating from the 1970s as well as a “Weird History” section of New Hampshire Magazine dating from the late 1990s. But after looking over everything, especially taking notice of the missing persons cases, lost hikers and uncovered remains, we both started to notice a pattern. We searched up the victims, some being Hillsborough residents along with a couple of tourists or travelers. They mostly lived very different lives, some from very different parts of the county and all from different times in the past century. But one thing was the same amongst them all. They had all lost their husbands or their wives.

Audrey looked up at me with a sense of fear in her eyes as we both came to that same conclusion. I gave her a confused reaction.

“W-what are you so nervous about? Doesn’t look like there's been a case like this in twenty years. It’s a weird coincidence, sure but-” I started nonchalantly, tossing one of the files onto the table.

“My dad… my dad was-*is*… he is a widower” She admitted, sinking into the chair behind her. “My stepmom Debra… she died when I was 13. That’s actually why my Dad moved us to Hillsborough. I guess he couldn’t stand living in the same house they’d shared together.”

I didn’t respond, quietly taking a seat next to her. Audrey quietly started to cry, overwhelmed with more emotion than I could imagine. I tried my best to comfort her, my own thoughts racing a thousand miles a minute. This still had to be just a big coincidence. It had to be. Monsters aren’t real. This is Hillsborough, not Transylvania. But I had to admit, I was curious. I wanted to say I knew the Weeping Widow wasn’t real. I wanted to say it without a shadow of a doubt. But somewhere deep in the back of my mind there was a doubt. And it worried me.

We didn’t stay in the records room much longer. We’d copied whatever documents we found important enough and quickly went for the exit. The sun was fleeting in the sky as we made our way back to the car. We each pulled open our respective doors and sat down, the whistling wind outside being snuffed out as we encased ourselves inside. There was a long silence, both of us having the same thought but clearly nervous to admit it to each other.

“We have to look for it.” Audrey finally spoke, a measure of insistence in her voice.

“W-what?” I asked in clarification.

“The Widow’s house. W-we need to rule it out. Let’s be honest, if we don’t just go up there and prove to ourselves that there’s nothing in that forest, it’s going to be in the back of our minds forever.” She explained. I knew she was right. But I also knew she didn’t really believe what she was saying. And neither did I.
