MateA: "Hey, how about we go on a walk right fucking now, a little bit of movement never hurt the old bones before and I'd just looooove to sleep in tomorrow without any feelings of guilt..."

MateB: "Yeah, I'm not sure day drinking was the best idea but, I guess, I appreciate how honest about your personal issues you are, mate!?"

MateA is in the process of buttoning up his brightly blue winter coat, dude loves his flamboyant fashion: "Come on, we'll get a headstart on our New Year's resolutions, everyone dreams of losing a little bit of weight, right? We could get both of us up to well beyond 10k steps while simultaneously reducing our risk of falling asleep ahead of time!"

MateB: "..."

MateA: "This is what I'm talking about, you dopey fuck!"

MateB: "Alright, alright, whatever gets you to shut the fuck up.'

Both of them get ready for a hike in the nearby forest. There hasn't been a ton of snow but the frost settling on the lands has been abundant in recent times. Objects seem coolly crisp during most of the day, faintly illuminated by the glow of icy covers, but as of now, as the sun lazily sets, they appear to be bathed in warm honey, coagulated in the embers of an indescribablly snuggly fabric of light.

They take a walk in this late afternoon.

MateB takes a swig from a bottle of herbal liquor, as he walks alongside his pal: "I don't get how this is supposed to help me stay up, but I do get how it's supposed to help me stay here."

MateB hands the bottle over to MateA who takes an equally deep gulp: "Yeah, it's nice! I'm a genius only uhh, I don't know."

MateB: "You don't know? You don't know? When did you start being insecure?"

MateA: "..." 

MateB iis starting to feel a bit uneasy, he can't quite make out what is wrong with the winter wonderland surrounding him or what might be on his friend's mind, but, he's somehow sure the issue lies within the former, perhaps only because his friend's might is generally vacant.. but the shadows, they

They are both startled as they hear a howl from somewhere ahead of them, followed by a series of sparks decorating the deepening, cerulean colors painting the heavens.

MateA: "MOTHERFUCKER"

MateB: "Yeah, I don't get why they would start shooting their shit this early on, either... and in this wilderness, too!"

They keep on walking, meeting no one. Meanwhile the saturation is shifting from warm to cold.

MateB:  "Okay, now I'm reeeeally sure day drinking wasn't a smart idea, could you guess what my stupidly drunk brain might think might be off about those trees over there?"

MateA: "You're thinking the shadows are patchy."

MateB: "...Did you mix something into these drinks? I might have to kill you for that, my friend, those shadows are so fucking wobbly, I don't like that."

MateA: "Yeah."

They keep on walking, their ability to compare their present environment to reality as they know it continually decreasing.

MateB: "Man, I'm feeling sluggish"

MateA: "The shadows are tugging at me."

MateB:  "This was your idea! I hope you won't carry those lazy excuses over to the new year, buddpal!"

The darkness now possesses a pulsing character, ever so often the moon's reflection upon a particular spot suddenly wanes, replaced by blackness on the ground and hollering fire in the sky. The two Mates have had a lot to drink and pay it comparatively little mind.

MateA: "We need an ambulance"

MateB: "Yeah, passing out in the forest on the first day of the new year wouldn't fit in with your agenda, right?"

MateA: "Oh, piss off!"

MateA is no more.

MateB staggers to a halt, fireworks now shrieking in a feral, almost infernal chorus way above his head, darkness pulsing, consuming the bright flesh of the land. He, like a primordial fly trapped in viscous insanity, is frozen in what he sees as the universe's seizure.

MateB: "..."
