It was a Friday. I was alone and stupid. The lights were bright. Somewhere, there was music. Next to the bar sat a woman. A brunette with legs like chopsticks. She sipped on a gin and tonic. Her dress was red and shone brightly.

"What are you doing here?" I asked.

"Waiting for men like you."

She was of a stunning white. I ordered a drink for her and sat down.

"You come here often?"

"I practically live here," she answered.

She was bubbly, charming in every way. She held her hands in mine, attentive to every word I said. The night was moving along. I felt strong, attractive even. The bartender watched us. She wanted to kiss me, I could feel it. Her lips reached across my neck. I closed my eyes.

"Nina!" the bartender screamed. "Do that again and I will kill you."

He was a man of small stature, old and wrinkly. Still, a danger lingered. The woman turned around. Blood ran across her mouth. Suddenly a stinging pain shot up my neck.

"You just bit me!" I screamed.

The woman ignored me.

"We have to eat," she accused the man. "This human food is not enough. We need blood."

She pounced. The next moment I was on the ground. Her hands had grown to claws. Her skin was as pale as glass. It was all too much for me. She was strong. Her breath flared across my neck. Soon she would get me.

Her eyes were bloodshot, wild like a tiger's. Her fists pounded against my stomach. Across the room the bartender raised his arm. Somewhere behind this fog of pain, the man held a chair in his claw. The monster sank her teeth in. The man threw the chair. Then there was nothing but a loud explosion. Thousands of splintered wood pieces flew around me. The woman cried out in pain.

The smell of charcoal infected the air. The monster was beaten, unconscious from the crash.

"This one time I helped you," the man said, lending me his hand. "But this woman has tasted your blood. Now wherever you are the Finnigans will be."

His gaze was sorrowful. There was guilt on his face. What was there to say? I had witnessed the impossible. Now I must carry on.

I made my way through the debris. I didn't dare to look back. The streets were long and empty and normal, more so than they should be. The pain was immense. Soon my house was getting closer. I needed rest. I needed time to process what I had witnessed. Instead, only steps away from the door, I noticed a grey cylinder block that had appeared right next to my home. A tall sign that read: The Finnigan's. She was winking at me. The demon saw me. It was on its chase.

"Now wherever you are the Finnigans will be."

Every day she gets closer. I can hear her knock against the windows, scratch at my door. There's nowhere for me to go. I beg for your help. Has anyone else been to a bar with that name? How can I escape the vampire sitting inside of it? Am I done for? Save me. You are my only hope.
