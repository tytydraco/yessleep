CW: addiction, mention of physical & sexual child abuse

\*\*\*\*\*

I found Theo as I had before, curled up under his covers, shaking and crying.  I sat beside him and tried to gather him in my arms.  This time, though, he pulled away.

“What’s going on, buddy?” I asked.

“I dreamed…” he sobbed, “I dreamed I woke up, and you were gone!  And then… and then… The Uglies came back and took me away!”

The Uglies.  Alyssa told me he’d used that phrase before - she thought he meant the foster family he’d lived with before the group home.  Alyssa didn’t know much for sure, Theo hadn’t been assigned to her then, but other social workers told her The Uglies were sketchy and possibly abusive.  

“Kiddo, I’m not going anywhere,” I reassured Theo.  “I’ll never abandon you.”

I reached for him.  He withdrew from my touch.

“But you already did!”

I kicked my legs onto the bed and lay beside Theo, giving him plenty of space.  I tapped my pocket six times, though my lighter wasn’t there.  Theo had me dead to right.  One day, I’d need to explain to my son I’d chosen the uncomplicated euphoria of heroin over the rough, tedious, but endlessly rewarding joy of raising him.  

I met Sakura at a house party in San Diego.  We bonded over shared needles and Johnnie Walker.  One night, bored and strung out on lines of good-quality cocaine, we drove all night to Vegas, lost our gas money at The Venetian, pawned her earrings, and got married by Elvis in a little chapel with plastic flowers.  I loved Sakura like I didn’t know it was possible to love anyone.  My love for her was pure, deep, warm, and sticky like honey.  

Sakura could hold her liquor - when she woke up puking, she went straight to the CVS for a pregnancy test.  Those two little blue lines did what nine combined attempts at rehab couldn’t: they made us get clean and stay clean.

At least for awhile.  

Sakura found a job in the kitchen of a Japanese restaurant; I washed dishes and picked up labor gigs off Craigslist and stood outside Home Depot with Mexican guys who taught me everything I knew about construction.  At night, we’d curl up and talk about the future. Sometimes, we’d kick around names: Olivia, Midori, Caleb, Kendall, Sebastian. 

She didn’t know that, as we cuddled and daydreamed, I was already using again.

I’d intended to stick to dealing.  Honest work didn’t pay well, and we were about to have another mouth to feed, and I still knew lots of people.  But I’m the sort of guy who can’t resist getting high off my own supply.  Using kept me in a fog, dulled the edges of the world.  It dulled my senses, too - enough so that I fell for an obvious sting, courtesy of the State of California.  

When I was first locked up, Sakura wanted nothing to do with me.  I couldn’t say that was her worst decision.  But she softened as time wore on.  We started exchanging letters; she’d send photos of Theo.  Then one day, when Theo would’ve been about two years old, the letters stopped coming.  I thought Sakura took Theo and left town - again, it wouldn’t have been her worst decision.  It was my old public defender who eventually gave me the news.  

Sakura was dead.  An aneurysm burst in her brain.  

And Theo had no one.  

\*\*\*\*\*

I’d texted Alyssa a few times.  Finally, that Sunday, she replied.  We met at the same park we’d used for visitations and, as Theo dug a hole under the slide, we sat at the picnic table and talked.

“Tell me about Bronwyn,” I said.

Alyssa smiled sheepishly.  “Yeah… I’m sorry if I got you in trouble.  That outburst wasn’t exactly professional.”

“It’s fine.”  I didn’t want to tell her *why* I was so suddenly curious about Bronwyn.  

“She was my first charge, out of school,” Alyssa said.  “This adorable little five-year-old girl.  Her parents both had serious mental issues.  Mom passed, a do-it-yourself thing.  Dad tried, but he was schizophrenic and had absolutely zero support.  But you wouldn’t know it if you knew Bronwyn.  She was the happiest, giggliest little kid - always smiling, even when she and her dad had to sleep under bus shelters.  She only owned one toy: this little teddy bear with a dress.  She loved that thing.

“The last time I saw them, Bronwyn’s dad was super hopeful.  He said he’d found a place in a shelter that specialized in parents with mental struggles.  It was called Lost Souls Refuge.  Then…”

“She disappeared,” I finished.

“I never saw Bronwyn again,” Alyssa confirmed.  “But… her dad did call me, one time.  I think he was having an episode.  He kept on repeating, ‘I have to save the children.’”

I thought back to that day in my house, the look of terror on her face when she’d seen those words painted under my table.  I understood now.  And I was scared, too.

“I looked into the place, Lost Souls Refuge,” Alyssa continued.  “It seemed… legit, I guess.  Registered 401c3.  I drove by the address the dad gave me - it was a real shelter, though it didn’t have many residents and it shut down soon after.  I only uncovered one weird detail, and it wasn’t exactly something I could go to the cops with.”

I nodded.  Alyssa took a deep breath.

“The shelter had once been a house that belonged to a writer named Perla Cuenca.  Remember those books I told you about awhile ago, with the mushroom circles?”

I did.  And I remembered she’d said those books had gotten dark.

“Well, Perla Cuenca wrote them.  Two books, supposedly for children.  I bought copies of both off eBay because I wanted to learn more about Perla.  She was a Cuban refugee, raised by her grandmother in Pasadena.  Her parents and siblings hadn’t been able to get out of the country - I’m not sure whether she saw them again in her lifetime.  Perla wrote about kids who had adventures with elementals.  You know, spirits associated with earth or wind or fire or whatever.  

“Well, Perla made some money off those books, then she got strange.  She inherited the house she’d grown up in and locked herself away there, became a recluse and, if you trust 80’s gossip, became a witch.  There’s some fan theories she… actually could communicate with elementals, and she’d enslaved them and forced them to work in her garden.  Some even crazier theories held she’d hire and kill gardeners and maids… because elementals, when trapped, need to feed on blood to maintain their human bodies.  She might’ve been the leader of a witch-cult, too.  Apparently the daughter of a neighbor was completely in thrall to her; the girl’s parents tried to get the police involved.  Perla died in 1989.  Her house burned down.  Though some people insist her body was found with no soot in her lungs and bruises all around her neck.  Here - I’ll find a picture of her.”

Alyssa scrolled on her phone, then handed it to me.  I wasn’t surprised.  But still, the confirmation drenched me like a bucket of ice water.  

The woman in the picture, Perla Cuenca, was the woman I’d seen in my dream.

“There’s some conspiracy theory that her elementals got free and killed her,” Alyssa said.  

*She’d gotten her comeuppance.*  

\*\*\*\*\*

I paced, and I tapped my pocket six times, and I paced some more.  

Alyssa left, off to visit a new charge in Panorama City.  Theo was still working on his hole.  I couldn’t put it all together.

Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.  *That’s because you’re thinking logically.*  Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.  *Let yourself believe fairy tales are real.*  

Perla Cuenca caught herself an elemental or two or three.  A lonely refugee, she wanted friends who’d never abandon her.  Elementals, when trapped, could be a lot of things: a friend, but also a servant, or protection against other, more dangerous supernatural beings.  Perla turned cruel and began mistreating her elemental friends-slash-captives.  So they broke free when Perla’s house caught on fire.  Or maybe, they set the fire.  One way or another, an elemental strangled her.  And then it… it flew away to Neverland? 

Or maybe, it - like Perla - became dark and angry.  Vengeful.

Perla Cuenca died in 1989.  Reverend Fletcher had his first vision in 1990.  

Maybe Perla’s elemental was The Grey Rock Ghoul.  Elementals feed on blood, required blood to maintain their human forms; Reverend Fletcher insisted the abomination of his visions was a shape-shifter that craved the blood of innocent children.  Alyssa said Perla may have had a cult of her own - or at least a neighbor girl who acted as her apprentice.  

As long as Reverend Fletcher was alive, he kept The Grey Rock Ghoul at bay.  

Then he died.  And the Grey Rock Ghoul, now unopposed, was free to snack on all the child blood he wanted - aided and abetted by Perla’s witch acolytes.  

And how does one ensure an endless supply of child blood?

Open a preschool.

\*\*\*\*\*

Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.  *Theo is fine.*  Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.  *They haven’t hurt him yet, they won’t hurt him today.*  

I didn’t want to take Theo back to All Souls Preschool ever again.  I’d intended to go back only once, that Monday, to collect my last check and announce my immediate resignation.  But Theo begged me to let him return.

“Please!  I’ll do anything you want!  Please don’t take me away!” he cried, on his knees, little hands clasped.  “I’ll never ask for anything again!”

Groveling always turned me to mush, even when I was dealing.  So I took Theo to school.  I retreated to the church.  And I tried to focus on patching my first hole while my mind raced like a bat on meth.  

*If The Misses really are cultist-witches who follow the teachings of Perla Cuenca*, I thought, *and they really intend to sacrifice the kids to The Grey Rock Ghoul, then why has nothing happened to the kids for the three months I’ve been here?*  

Maybe I’d launched myself too far into outer space.  Accusing three biddie schoolteachers of being child-sacrificing witches seemed like something a 300-pound neckbeard who lives in his mom’s basement and on Reddit would do.  But I couldn’t deny the tornado of weird I’d been spinning in for weeks.

Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. 

Perla Cuenca - a writer I’d never knew existed - appearing in my dream like a fucking celebrity cameo.  The symbol on the wall, roasted ghostbuster Reverend Fletcher.  Elementals.  Bronwyn.  Kyle.  Those kids, darting around like roaches.  My freaky bout of sleep writing.  Save the children.  Winter, and her creepy song.  

*They all want to dance, but if you want to go to heaven*

*You’ll reach out your hand and you’ll dance with seven.*  

Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

*Seven.  Seven.*  

I figured it out.  And it brought me to my knees.  

They had six kids.  They needed seven.

\*\*\*\*\*

“Theo!” I screamed, forcing my way through the door.  “Theo!  Now!”

I found Miss Janice watercoloring with Anna Rae, Grace, and Peter.  Miss Annie sat at her desk, writing in a planner, while Winter, Jason and Corbin stacked legos.  Where was my son?

“THEO!” I shouted.  

“Jake!”  Miss Marin approached me.  “Keep your voice down.”

I barely restrained myself from decking her right there.  “Where’s my son?”

Miss Marin’s expression didn’t break.  “He’s resting.  I assure you…”

“THEO!”  I ran through the classroom, down the hall, to the room.

That room. The locked room Miss Annie had freaked out when Alyssa tried to open.  What did they keep in that room?  Images danced through my head: a moldy dungeon with manacles attached to the wall and rats squeaking from dark corners.  Saran Wrap and pooling blood.  Pagan symbols etched onto a sacrificial altar.  Battered dolls, meat hooks, piles of small human bones.  

I took ahold of the knob and wrenched it as hard as I could.  It didn’t budge.  I stepped back, squared my shoulders, and flung myself against the door.  

SLAM!  Pain shot through my arm.  

The doorknob turned.  The door opened.  And Theo stood in front of me, rubbing his eyes.

“Theo!” I grabbed my son, swung him up in my arms, and pressed his body tightly against mine.  

I looked into the locked, now-unlocked room.

Six little beds, each with a cartoon-themed comforter and stuffed animals.  Three larger beds.  Posters of children’s book covers on the walls.  Shelves of children’s clothes.  

Humiliation wracked my body like an earthquake.  My spiraling imagination crash-landed into reality, leaving me picking up the wreckage of my broken psyche.  Had I seriously convinced myself three middle-aged daycare teachers were planning to sacrifice my son to an imaginary monster created by a dead cult leader?  Sobriety, parenthood, membership in a functioning society - I clearly wasn’t cut out for any of it.  

Theo encased in my arms, I avoided Miss Marin’s unshakeable eyes.  

The last thing I remembered was a prick in my shoulder.  

Then blackness.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up with bugs under my skin.  Itching, itching, like it had when I'd detoxed and gone into withdrawals.  I couldn’t move my arms or legs.  I felt mosquitos settling on my shoulder, the night air against my cheek.

I opened my eyes.

My first realization: I was itchy because I was lying in sand.  My second: I couldn’t move because my arms were tied behind my back.  And third: I’d somehow been returned to the yard of All Souls Preschool.

I saw Theo.

Theo lay on one of the little plastic tables The Misses set up for the kids’ lunch.  He was motionless, his eyes closed.  I saw his small chest rise and fall, and for half a second, my sense of relief surged.  Until I saw the other kids.

They sat in plastic chairs on either side of Theo, in rows of three.  Their bodies were stiff as boards, as still as my son.  The faces of the three facing me - Winter, Jason, Anna Rae - looked like masks, their eyes glassy and unmoving.  They may as well have been dolls.  

I heard off-key humming.  The Misses appeared from inside the building.  I’d have thought they’d be wearing long, hooded black robes.  But they weren’t.  Just their same old schoolteacher garb.  Miss Annie and Miss Janice carried bowls.  Miss Marin - a long, sharp knife.

*No.*  I struggled against my binds, screaming against the gag forced in my mouth.  ‘

Miss Marin looked up at me and frowned.

“Oh.  You’re awake.”  She smacked her own forehead.  “Of course.  Addict.  We should’ve used a stronger dose.  Well.  I guess I owe you an explanation, don’t I?”

I writhed and screamed muffled curses.

“I’ll take that as a yes!”  Miss Marin placed the knife on the table and clasped her hands.  “When the three of us weren’t much older than Theo here, we began our training with a man named Roy Fletcher.  He was a great man.  He taught us to fight dark spirits, to protect the children.”

“He fought hard,” Miss Annie picked up.  “But unfortunately, he became possessed by an abomination known as The Grey Rock Ghoul.  And, with Reverend Fletcher’s body, the Grey Rock Ghoul stole my innocence.”

“He stole all of our innocence,” Miss Marin clarified.  “He’d lead us girls, one by one, to the little classroom - the one you so kindly cleaned up for us - and…”

Her voice trailed off.  She didn’t need to finish.

“Reverend Fletcher told us we couldn't tell anyone," Miss Janice said, "because if we did, The Grey Rock Ghoul would kill us all.  We tried to save him, but we weren't strong enough.  So we had to drug the reverend, like we drugged you, and set his church on fire.”

“But The Grey Rock Ghoul wasn’t gone!” Miss Annie said.  “We knew he was still hanging around, just waiting to possess someone else and steal more children’s innocence!”

Miss Marin pointed to the children, who remained living dolls.  Dolls that, I suddenly realized, weren’t breathing.

“They’re not real children,” she said.  “They’re elementals - spirits of the trees - wearing child-shaped costumes.  My neighbor, Perla Cuenca, figured out how to trap elementals.  My parents weren’t supposed to talk to her.  Reverend Fletcher said she was a witch.  But I loved my Aunt Perla, and she left me everything - including her spells.”

“We trapped six of them,” Miss Janice said.  “Young ones.  We made a circle, and we lured them with a rhyme.  They became our servants, and their task was simple: protect the children from those nightmarish things that would steal their innocence.  So long as the six elementals are under our power, The Grey Rock Ghoul is powerless.”

“But unfortunately,” Miss Marin cut in, “Nothing comes without sacrifice.  To keep them in this form, they require the blood of one child, every five years.  Just one.  To protect the innocence of all.  And we only take the broken ones.”

*The broken ones.*  I spat out my gag.  I should’ve been furious at that characterization of my son, but I found my anger had cooled to something resembling… well, pity.

“You’re delusional!” I yelled.  “The Grey Rock Ghoul didn’t steal your innocence, a perverted man did.  You're just blaming it all on this entity Reverend Rapist definitely made up, because that's easier than dealing with your trauma."

Miss Annie frowned.  I allowed myself to consider that maybe, just maybe, I’d gotten through to her.  

“Protection of innocence requires sacrifice,” Miss Marin said firmly.  “We all wanted our own families, but we sacrificed that to remain as guardians.  I sacrificed thousands of dollars Aunt Perla left me to fund this operation and pay your wages.  And you sacrificed your son to get high.”

She nodded at the other two.  They placed one bowl in front of each elemental-child.  

I looked around desperately, hoping an answer would reveal itself.  I noticed the slashed-up poinsettia trees were arranged in a perfect circle around the playground.  A Faerie circle.  

Six of them.  

Miss Marin picked up her knife and wiped it on the hem of her dress.  

*Lure an elemental into a circle*, Alyssa had said.  Perla Cuenca’s red flowers caught on fire.  Septima… Latin for seven.  The kids weren’t announcing their need for a seventh child.  They were calling out to Perla’s favorite elemental.  Save the children.  Save… *her* children.  *She was their mother.*

Miss Janice ran a finger along Theo’s slender wrist.

I tapped one tied index finger against the constricting rope.  Seven times.  *Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.  Seven.  Seven.  Seven.*

Something shifted.  My binds loosened.  I turned my wrists and slipped out of the knotted rope.  In one swift movement, I reached into my pocket and pulled out my lighter.  I flicked it and lunged for the nearest poinsettia tree.

“No!” Miss Marin screamed.

Through luck or by a higher power, the tree went up like a candle.  The fire spread to the second poinsettia tree, and then the third.  

The children began to shake.  Like puppets on a string, they were elevated into the air, arms and legs dangling.  Green mist formed around them, emanating from their mouths and ears, forming a thick fog around them and The Misses.  

I didn’t wait around for the finale.  I stumbled to my feet, dove headfirst into the greenish cloud, swung Theo into my arms, and ran out the back gate towards the parking lot.  As I ran, I heard screams.  Then three loud cracks, a series of snaps, then nothing but the high-pitched hissing of compressed air.  

\*\*\*\*\*

My fire picked up where the previous fire left off.  It flattened the church and the preschool.  A week later, the police dragged me in for questioning.  But their interest in me didn’t last long.

Because, buried at the feet of the six destroyed poinsettia trees, they found skeletal remains of a number of missing people.  Bronwyn Acevedo and her father, Ignacio.  A disabled foster kid named Kyle Wood, who’d disappeared in 2014.  More children.  Poor children, immigrant children, homeless children.  Broken children.  Kids who slip through the cracks all the time.

\*\*\*\*\*

That night, as All Souls Preschool burned, I ran with Theo down the hill to a 7-Eleven.  I convinced the sweet teen-aged clerk to lend me her phone, then I dug Alyssa’s number out of my emails.  Alyssa didn’t ask questions when she arrived to drive us home.  She just stared straight ahead as I sat, silently, in the back seat, holding Theo like I’d never let go.

Theo squirmed.  He opened his eyes.

“Daddy?  I had another nightmare.”

“It’s okay, kiddo,” I whispered.  “Go back to sleep, you’re safe here with me.”

He nodded and nestled into my chest.
