When my daughter Emma died in 2009, I thought the worst pain was over. I was wrong.

She was only ten. Hit by a drunk driver while riding her bike in front of our house. I don’t need to describe the hell that followed — if you’ve lost a child, you already know it. If you haven’t, thank whatever god you believe in.

The first voicemail came on what would have been her 24th birthday.

It was 3:16 a.m. when my phone buzzed. I was already awake — insomnia’s been my shadow since we buried her. I recognized the number instantly. It was hers. We’d kept her phone plan going for a while after her death, just to hear her voice on the voicemail. Eventually we canceled it. Or I thought we did.

The message was only a few seconds long:
“Dad?”
Then static.

I sat up in bed, phone shaking in my hand. I played it again.
Same thing.
Same voice.

Her voice. Not a glitchy AI sound, not some kid playing a prank — it was Emma, soft and confused, just like she used to sound when she woke up from a nightmare.

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night. I didn’t tell anyone.

The next night, it happened again.

“Dad… are you still mad at me?”
Static. Then silence.

I stopped checking the messages for a few days, thinking if I didn’t listen, it would stop. It didn’t. They came every night at 3:16 a.m. exactly. Always from her old number. Always her voice.

I finally gave in and listened to all of them. Some were whispers I couldn’t make out. Some were just sobbing. One night, she said, “I’m cold. It’s so dark here.”

I took the phone to the police. The officer was sympathetic, but firm — probably a scam, maybe some kind of sick hacking. They’d “look into it.”

They never called me back.

I contacted the phone company. Her number had been reassigned to a teenager in Wisconsin. I spoke to his mother. She said he hadn’t used the phone in months — he’d lost it. Around the same time the voicemails started.

My therapist told me it was grief, unresolved trauma. That my brain was playing tricks on me.

But here’s the thing. Emma said something in her last voicemail that shattered any doubt.

It was June 3rd — the anniversary of her death. The message was longer this time.
“Dad, I saw you by the bike. I tried to yell. I waved. You looked right through me.”
Then a pause. Then:
“Why did you pretend you didn’t see me?”

I hadn’t told anyone I visited the exact spot that day. Not my sister, not my ex-wife. No one.

I did think I saw something. A flicker in the corner of my eye — a small figure in a blue jacket, the same one she was wearing that day. But when I turned, nothing was there. I told myself it was my imagination.

Then came the final message. Two nights ago.

It was different. Louder. More… alive.

“Daddy. I’m not supposed to talk to you anymore. He’s getting mad.”

Static crackled like fire. Then I heard a new voice — not Emma’s. It was deep, and slow, and wrong. It said:
“Stop looking. You’ll see us soon enough.”

The line went dead.

I smashed the phone.

Yesterday, I got a new number. New provider. Burned the old SIM. Brand new phone.

And still… tonight, at exactly 3:16 a.m., the phone buzzed. One new voicemail.

From Emma.
