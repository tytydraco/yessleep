The rain thudded on the station roof in a relaxing beat. Since it was raining, that meant there wasn’t much to be done in the way of work. So the three of us who were on ranger duty that night decided to relax, order some Chinese food, and just hang out. Definitely not a bad way to spend an evening at work. And here in New Mexico, where the parks had both cooler climates to the north and deserts to the south, there was no shortage of impressive scenery.

Milo, Isaac, and I were sharing some takeout from a local place we frequented. It was as good as it always is, and after we’d finished, we sat around and chatted about nothing in particular. For some reason, the conversation turned to our backgrounds and how we arrived at being park rangers here. I had just offered my own story when Isaac turned to Milo.

“You’re very quiet Milo. Not fond of walking down memory lane, are you?”

It was a simple question. I’d also noticed Milo wasn’t a bit talker about the past since we started working together over the years. We were all in our late 30s by now, and while we’d all chatted plenty of times, there was still a lot we didn’t know about each other.

Milo paused while he considered the question.

“No,” he eventually said with a small chuckle. “I guess I’m not.”

“Nothing wrong with that,” Isaac offered. “To each his own.”

“I guess. I just don’t realize how little I talk about the past. Or that I never told you why I moved out here.”

No, he didn’t. And I didn’t push the issue. Just like I don’t push most people on what they don’t want to talk about. I’ve learned that no matter what people say they want to talk about, if they want to discuss something, they will. If not, forget it. And we all learned pretty quick that there were certain things Milo didn’t want to discuss. And that’s just fine with me. There are things I don’t particularly like to talk about. So Isaac and I sat there quietly as Milo wrestled with whatever it was the past meant to him.

“I’m originally from Virginia,” Milo said. “The southern side of the state. I liked it there. Have a lot of good memories there overall, but I moved out here, close to where the desert is, to get away from the woods. I love nature, but the woods are a different story. I like being able to see whatever is out there. That’s what I love so much about the desert. It is exactly what you see. Bad things can happen in the desert, but you know that upfront. It’s dry, it’s hot, and rattlesnakes and scorpions can be found there. The woods though? No telling who or what may be out there. I won’t deny I was lucky once because of the woods, but I was worried that was my one bit of luck. And it’s not good enough to be lucky in the woods once.”

He had a point there.

“So I left the area for good. I was a park ranger out there. I was still pretty new at the job when it happened. I remember it was a few days after a nasty thunderstorm. And it seemed freezing cold that night. Not that it actually was that cold, it just felt like it. The was a ton of fog that night, and it surrounded the trees. It was a very cool sight. Not that the woods out there weren’t always a sight to behold, because they were. Whether it was fall and the leaves were turning orange, or it was winter, and the trees were all coated with snow and ice, I always found something new to appreciate and behold. That night was no different. Because I appreciated what the woods could mean on a completely different level.”

“What happened?” I asked.

“I went out to the store. Just by myself. For some routine errands. I came back, and everything was quiet. But that was normal. It wasn’t until I opened the door to the ranger station and saw the whole place had been trashed that I knew something was up. Everything was completely destroyed, and my colleagues Billy and Howard were nowhere to be found. There was no sign anyone had been injured, but I could feel it in the air that something was up, and it wasn’t good. And while there are a lot of things I can’t quite recall about that night, I can tell you that I had never felt so alone or isolated, and I haven’t since.

“But the most frightening part was that I wasn’t alone. Not really. Because whoever was responsible was still out there. I just didn’t know where. Being out there in the woods, you realize sooner or later that it has been host to a lot of bad things, and you’re just the latest chapter. All the things people have done out there over the centuries, with nothing but the trees and scenery to watch. Well, I decided that the trees were gonna see me escape. And other parts of the scenery were going to help. So I picked up a rock and hurled it as far as I could to distract whoever was out there. I heard it thud a ways away. And while I was picking up a few more rocks for use later, I listened for the sound of someone going after it. When I heard nothing, I decided to take a few more steps. And then a few more. Then I stopped. And fell.”

“You fell?” I asked.

He slowly nodded. “I didn’t realize it at the time, but all the recent storms had caused some flooding. It had gone away by that night, but it had the side effect of exposing a pit in the woods that had previously gone unnoticed. And I fell right in. I didn’t fall far, but when it’s pitch dark out, you don’t know exactly where you are, and someone trashed the ranger station you work in and is out there in the dark with you, it seems like forever.

“I landed on a mix of hard rock and wet soil, so it wasn’t too bad. It was the darkness that was the worst. Even after I took out the small flashlight I had on my belt, it seemed so thick. But I had no choice but to keep going and follow the tunnel in the cave I’d landed in. It was small, and the edges were rough and damp, but it didn’t look like anyone had been in the cave I found myself in for a long time.”

The rain outside seemed to let up as Milo continued with his story.

“The cave seemed endless. Every time I thought I’d reached the end, there was another tunnel. On and on. And the longer I was down there, the more I started to get afraid. Afraid that I was stuck down there. Afraid that the other end would be boarded up. Or that whoever was out there would realize where I’d gone and would track me down there. So I did my best to ignore those thoughts and keep moving.

“I eventually came to an opening in the cave, but any sense of relief was gone when I saw that it opened up into a massive space, and it was filled with water. Water that I could barely see anything in even with my flashlight. The only way to get across it was by a narrow path that just barely reached the surface. A large section of the cave floor was elevated, and that was the part that made the path that remained above water, while the rest of the room seemed to be flat, and that’s where the water was. So, with no choice, I carefully started walking across to the other side, where the path went on far beyond where I could see.

“It was slow going. I don’t think I’ve ever been more careful walking across anything in my life. The path was just large enough for one person to walk across, and if I fell, I would go straight in the water, and I had no idea how deep it was. Or what was in it for that matter. So I took it super slow. Step by step. And gradually, I made progress. Even though one time, I took a step, slipped a tiny bit, and almost fell in the water. I caught myself, but it was a close call. Eventually, I made it to the other side of the cavern, and when I did, I had to stop and catch my breath for a moment. The humidity in the space was stifling, so I was drenched by then.

“But when I eventually kept on walking, the atmosphere got less damp, and it actually felt a bit cool in the other parts of the cave. And, as time went on, I felt I was actually moving upwards. Then, I could feel things start to get lighter and clearer, until I arrived at an opening in the cave wall and stepped through it. It took me a moment to figure out where I was, but I did, and I was shocked. Somehow, the cave had led me to an opening in the basement of the Rolling Springs Mall.”

Milo paused for a moment before continuing. “The Rolling Springs Mall was a local mall about 30 minutes outside of the town I grew up in. It wasn’t the closest one to where I lived back then, but it was close enough that I had spent plenty of time there as a kid. It was your typical blast from the past mall from the 80s and 90s that began to struggle once we arrived in the 2000s and closed in about 2005. A real shame too. It was such a fun place. But isn’t that how it always is?”

I nodded in understanding. “You got that right. We all have a mall like that in our memory.”

Milo chuckled. “No doubt. Using my flashlight, I could see that the basement wall was pretty flimsy, and the elements had gone a long way to break down the surface. The opening I’d stepped through was a tiny sliver in the wall you would walk right past if you didn’t know it was there, especially in the dark. And as I stepped outside of the basement and began to explore the mall, that’s actually when I started to get the most uneasy. So I kept a close watch on what was around me. Not that there was much to see. The mall by that point had been pretty well abandoned, with only the faintest remnants of the thriving retail center I remembered from years before. It didn’t take me long to realize that the first floor was boarded up tight. But then I remembered something; the mall was two floors. So I went to the escalators, which were situated right at the very center of the complex. As I quietly headed there, I remembered a fountain used to be right next to them. And I was right, but all that remained was the indentation in the ground from where the fountain used to be. But the escalators were still there, motionless and silent after all these years.”

Then he took a deep breath before continuing. “But as I started going up the steps, I suddenly felt so uneasy. Like I was being watched. I was beyond on edge as I climbed up the escalator, and I couldn’t wait to reach the top.”

Milo paused for a sip of water before he kept talking. “The second floor of the mall was wide, but it was easy to look around and see everything. This part wasn’t anywhere near as dark or boarded up as the first floor, so there was more natural illumination from the skylight here. I could see all the vacant storefronts sitting there silently. But one caught my eye. It was halfway down the corridor going to the left, and the security gate was pulled down in front of what was once the store entrance. If I recall correctly, the store used to be a bookstore. So, naturally, I took a second look. And when I did, I almost yelled in shock.

“It was my fellow rangers Billy and Howard who’d gone missing from the ranger station. I was happy to see them, but then I saw their expressions in the glare from my flashlight. They looked terrified. As if they had been expecting something, or someone, much worse. So I ran up to them, and saw they both looked a little beat up, but otherwise ok. They immediately told me someone had knocked them out and they’d woken up in there, that the gate was locked, and the person responsible had gone off somewhere.

“Since they had no idea when or if whoever had done this would be back, I grabbed some tools off my belt and fiddled with the lock at the bottom of the gate. I’d had some experience with this, as being a locksmith ran in my family, so it took a minute or two, but eventually the old lock clicked, and I threw the gate open. Then Billy and Howard rushed out of there before I led them down the escalator and towards the basement. We were halfway down the basement steps when we heard a slam from the far end of the mall, then another slam as the door at that end closed.”

Milo sighed deeply for a moment. “We all stood there quietly for a minute as we heard the thud of thick boots walking on the floor. They steadily went towards the escalator steps and began climbing them. That’s when we knew we had to silently slip into the basement and go back through the cave. We managed that ok, but as Billy climbed through the opening as Howard and I’d done, we heard a loud crash come from somewhere inside the mall and knew that meant whoever that was knew something was up. So we ran through the cave as fast as possible until we could all carefully cross the space that had been flooded. The three of us had all just made it across when we heard footsteps approaching from somewhere at the far end of the cave. So we all hid behind some rock formations and waited.

“It seemed to take forever, but in reality, it didn’t take long for me to see the footsteps belonged to a massive figure that was dressed in a ski mask and thick leather boots and carried a thick flashlight. I watched from where I was as the figure looked around before trying to walk across the room. Whoever it was didn’t get far, because I guess those boots weren’t exactly good on the narrow path, because the figure slipped right off and landed in the water with a loud splash. None of us moved as whoever it was swore and tried to get back onto the ledge. But as that happened, I heard something else. The sound of something moving quietly in the water. Then the figure started yelling in pain before they splashed frantically around. Then came more yelling, and thanks to the flashlight, which was floating nearby in the water, I saw the cause of the yelling. There were snakes swimming around nearby. Snakes that I recognized immediately as Cottonmouths, although they are known by other names. We all watched as the figure got bit several more times and tried to get out of the water. The stranger eventually succeeded, but the combination of being bitten like that, being soaking wet, and the adrenaline of the moment meant that after a few steps, the figure wound up falling and landing headfirst onto a nearby rock formation.”

Milo visibly shuddered at the memory and was quiet for a moment before he finished the story.

“We eventually got out and carefully maneuvered around the figure and returned to the mall. This time, we could see the entrance the stranger had gotten in and out of and used that to get out and get to a nearby gas station to call for help. We told them what had happened, and they found the figure, just where we’d left him. Between the snake bites and the head injury, the guy didn’t make it. But they did figure out later he was wanted in connection with other violent crimes in three neighboring states. I left that park soon after, and Billy and Howard did the same. Because there’s one thing about that night I still can’t stop thinking about. Know what it is?”

“What’s that?” I asked.

“Billy and Howard have no memory of seeing anyone else, and since there’s no evidence to the contrary, people say he acted completely alone. That very well could be true. Or maybe he had an accomplice somewhere, or someone else who was in on it. I’ve kept in touch with a few friends from back home, and people have been known to discuss rumors the stranger didn’t act alone. That could also be true. But that’s not what keeps me up at night. It’s the fact that regardless of if the guy in the ski mask acted alone or not, there are plenty of people out there just like that. Whether we know who they are or not.”

That was one of the most frighteningly accurate things I’ve ever heard.
