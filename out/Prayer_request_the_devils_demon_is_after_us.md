Last night I awoke to a weird sound coming from my daughter Rosie's room. When I turned on the camera it showed this [thing lying in the bed](https://ibb.co/F0Yp1h7). I got a screenshot and ran straight into the room. My poor angel was sleeping next to where I saw it, but there was nothing on the bed but her - no sign of it anywhere. 

I woke her up. She said, "Why awake Mommy?" I asked her if she saw or heard anythin'. She started to cry for a snack. I told her it was important that she told me everything. She just kept crying, so I took her back to my room and we cuddled in my bed. She fell asleep in my arms. I stayed awake for the rest of the night with the light on. I got to thinkin', and that's when it hit me that it had to be some kind of demon. Pastor Dan had been preachin' that the Devil's on the loose every Sunday for the past month. 

The first thing this morning I called Pastor Dan. He told me to send the picture. The moment he saw it he told me that it was a demon sent by the Devil and that we needed to leave the house at once, that we were already in danger. He told me to bring Rosie to the church.

It was too late, the Devil had already done some work. 

Right as we were leavin' I noticed a rash on the left side of Rosie's face, the same side where I saw the demon. It was like she had the Scarlet Fever or something. I asked her if she felt sick, and she shook her head. I gave her a kiss. That's when I noticed something was wrong with her eyes, they were kind of rollin' around in her head, you know? I slapped her cheek and she came to with a scream. I hugged her and told her it'd be OK. The poor thing was scared out of her mind, but I definitely wasn't gonna let the Devil get to her. 

I rushed Rosie to the car without grabbing anything other than my purse. The moment I plopped her in the car seat I noticed a strange smell, like someone had been smokin' there. I wasn't surprised when I turned the engine and it stuttered. Surely the Devil's work, tryin' to keep us there so he could reap our souls. I texted Pastor Dan. He told us he'd come right away. I grabbed Rosie from the car and walked across the street. When I looked at the house, all I saw were plain white walls. Just another trick from the Devil, tryin' to get us to go back inside where he'd laid a trap for us. 

Pastor Dan prayed for us immediately when he arrived, casting the demon away in the name of Jesus. I never felt more relieved. We sat in the front seat of his truck, I held Rosie in my arms. Everything felt normal. I looked at the trees out the window as Pastor Dan drove. I could feel the presence of God wash over me like I'd taken a bath in the baptism bowl or something. It was weird. 

That feeling ended when we pulled up to the church. Something looked funny with the building like the brick walls were stained in oil, like from a car. I told Pastor Dan and he told me that they had someone comin' out to give them a wash tomorrow. I couldn't believe it was just dirt, though. I felt somehow that the demon had followed behind me and was now in the church. I had no idea how that could happen though, the Devil wanted nothin' to do with the church. I thought that I was just terrified and overreactin'

I felt a little shiver when I carried Rosie into the lobby. Pastor Dan told me that there were some spare cots in the fellowship room for us to sleep on and that there'd be a hot meal that evening. In the meantime, he said we needed to be in prayer "like you've never prayed before." We followed him upstairs into his office, where he told us to kneel and face the wall. Rosie started to cry and said she was hungry. Dan called Anna, the secretary, to come and give her a snack. Rosie followed Anna out of the room. 

I knelt awkwardly facing the wall, trying to put the smell of my own sweat out of my mind. I wish I'd had a chance to shower, or at least change my dress. It was all dirty and here I was in front of the pastor in his suit. He always said that the Lord saw good appearance as Godliness. I forced those thoughts out of my mind, the only thing I cared about was keepin' this demon away for good. 

Pastor Dan began to pray fervently, then started to speak in tongues as he did in service, calling the Heavenly Angels for protection. I felt comforted and started to speak in tongues myself as the Spirit willed within me. It was good to feel the presence of God. I asked him why the Devil was after me, why I'd seen the demon, but I didn't get an answer. 

After we'd prayed for a while words like Beezle and Derrica started to pour from my mouth like a stream of sewage. These were the names of the most evil ungodly things that I could think of. They felt so dirty, like spiders crawling all over me. Then I burst into tears as I felt the Devil being expelled from my soul. They ran hot down my cheeks as I began to thank the good Lord Jesus again and again for his everlasting grace. 

Then Pastor Dan went silent. I opened my eyes. The room was almost dark, the last slivers of daylight slipping through the window. I became aware of sweat tumbling out of every pore of my body, even my dress was stained with it. Never before have I wanted a shower more than I do now. 

I wondered if the Demon was gone for good.

Pastor Dan put my thoughts at ease, reading my mind. "It's gone for now," he said, "but the only way to keep it away is to tell everyone you know to pray for you. If you don't, then not only will it return, it will stalk your soul to steal it from the Lord. They need to pray and call on Jesus to protect you."

"Thank you, thank you, thank you," I told the Pastor. I can't say enough how wonderful he was, truly a blessing. 

I suddenly thought of Rosie, she'd been gone a long time. I asked Pastor Dan and he said she was downstairs in the fellowship room. He said to pray with her. When I went down I saw her playing with a small Elmo doll. I gasped. Pastor said never to let our children play with toys that resembled beasts, or horrible things, that they were of the Devil. I asked her where she got it, and she told me that she'd gotten it at school yesterday. Could that have been the thing that brought the Devil to our doorstep? 

I told her to get rid of it at once. She cried and asked, "Why mommy?" I told her "Not now," and then said we needed to pray. She tossed it in the garbage and joined my hands in prayer. 

Please hear us, and pray for us, that we might keep this horrible demon away! We just want to go home and be at peace with the Lord.
