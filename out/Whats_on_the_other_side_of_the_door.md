 Hello, I’m sorry this might sound odd but to properly explain my situation to the best detail. I awoke, minutes ago inside what I have come to conclude to be a kitchen, someone’s kitchen where I found this laptop displayed accessible to this page only. I can feel a confining energy bouncing back upon towards me echoing a howl onto me. These walls radiate an uncomfortable energy. My breath shaking being cluttered and crushed by the feeling of angst being seeped through these walls. Along with this space itself being an oddity. I was presented with 3 plain vertically long white walls secluded from any pictures or paintings, an absence of windows or skylight, with one singular overhead ceiling light and centered at the farthest wall it lies demanding focus. A tall, cold, steel door. 

  Yet, the pantries, cabinets, and fridge were all full and I’ve also confirmed there's access to running water. They’ve given me access to food as well as water, but what happens when I’ve eaten all the food? After analyzing I determined that there's enough food here to last months. As  if someone has just returned from a trip to the store. Stuffed with high quality brands, white marble countertops. This room, almost as if it's flaunting its own wealth towards me, the kitchen of a wealthy man, it's like the kitchen of my dreams.

 Whoever the owner of this kitchen is definitely has been blessed by wealth. Still everything is odd, everything down this laptop itself. I can’t access any other apps, no common commands work to escape, I am only presented with this screen. My only option is to type, my only option is to wait. Wait, wait and see what's coming. I don’t know where I am, I can’t even remember how I got here, if anyone is reading this please send help, if anyone is seeing this please get me out of here. I don’t want- wait, I..no I can’t seem to remember my own name. 

 I can't seem to remember who I am, I can't remember a single detail regarding myself. My oldest memory goes farthest back to the few minutes ago where I had woken. As far as I can remember my very own existence goes furthest back to when I had woken up. The most I can remember is this room, the most I know is this feeling is this calling. The calling to the door. The cold steel door that glares back to me, its shadows stretching out to me, calling to me. It’s darkness inviting itself out towards me, reaching out to me pleading for me to come to it for me to accept it. The door, I can sense the evil emitting from it, the malice oozing from its cracks, the hate. How long will they keep me here? Will they ever let me out of here? I don't know what's going to happen to me, I don't know what lies on the other side. What's on the other side of the door?
