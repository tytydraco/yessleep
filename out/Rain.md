"It's gloomier than usual here," I sighed as I gazed out the window, watching the rain cascade down in sheets onto the pavement. I longed to see the sun again, to explore the nearby forest clearing with Dips.

"June! Have you taken Dips out for his evening walk?" my mum hollered from the kitchen.

"Not yet Mum! It's pouring outside," I replied, my tone weary.

"Well, go get his raincoat and take him out. He needs his potty breaks," she retorted.

I grumbled under my breath. The rain had persisted for the past week, and I was growing weary of walking Dips in the downpour. However, I knew he needed the exercise and fresh air. Besides, his antics always brought a smile to my face, especially when he stumbled upon unusual items left behind by others. One time, he discovered an old chest adorned with mysterious symbols, and I couldn't resist running my fingers over them, feeling chills run down my back before dropping the chest on the ground. It was such a weird sensation. I was snapped back to reality when I felt a familiar snout bop my legs. Dips must have really wanted to go to the loo if he brought his leash to me voluntarily. I ruffled his fur and let him know we would be heading out soon. After waving goodbye to my mum, I armed both Dips and I with raincoats to battle the relentless droplets.

The sky was dark and foreboding, and thunder rumbled in the distance.

We made our way down our usual route. Our city is fortunate enough to have sheltered walkways in certain areas, and Dips, being the Shiba Inu he is, disliked getting wet paws. I often rolled my eyes at his reluctance to cross small puddles. I looked up and saw his favourite bush.

"Okay, buddy, do your thing. I'll be here watching and protecting you," I said.

Dips ran over, almost pulling me away when he recognised his bush. I laughed.

"Sorry buddy, you must really need the loo," I whispered.

I stood there in the streets, staring and people watching while I waited. The rain had let up a bit. Great, it would be a nice change from the gloomy sky. I pulled out my free hand, palm up, to feel the rain. Maybe one day I will learn to love the rain, but that thought did not finish itself as the pitter-patter of the rain on my skin formed a pattern.

Drip, drip... Drip Drip Drip Drip.. Drip… Drip.

It could not be right, but there it goes again.

Drip, drip... Drip Drip Drip Drip.. Drip… Drip.

I stood there, palm up and dumbfounded. Was this mores code?

Dips' growl brought me back, and I immediately spotted a man dodging behind an alleyway just in front of me. My heart skipped a beat and I felt uneased immediately. I tugged at Dips’ lesh.

"Let's go home, Dips, hurry," I said.

I hurried home, practically dragging my poor orange dog along, luckily our usual pathways were along the main streets where there are people about. Dips seems to be rather corporative as his hurried steps matched mine, maybe he senses the danger too. My mind raced as I slammed the door. My heart sank, I could have sworn I have seen the loaming figure following me down the streets when I turned back a couple of times.

“MUM!”

“What’s wrong sweetie?!”

“There is a man following me back home when I took Dips out for a walk.”

Her eyes widen as she stood up to look out the window.

“Describe him to me honey.”

“Black… black stripped pants… and a… … hat, mummy I’m scared.”

“Oh darling, come here.”

She gave me a tight hug, whispering words of comfort as she kept a lookout for the stranger.

“Well, whoever it is, I think he is gone sweetie. Now, let us get you and old doggie there warm up, shall we?

I nod, staring out at the window. The rain is heavier now.

Drip, drip... Drip Drip Drip Drip.. Drip… Drip.
