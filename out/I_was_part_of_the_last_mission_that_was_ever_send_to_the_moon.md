I remember so much of what made our once blue planet so wonderful. The green meadows, the blue sky, the fresh air, the children playing outside. We were at home. This planet was our home and would be forever. God, how I miss it. We didn't think it was impossible for life to exist on other planets, and even if there were signs, there was no clear evidence. I had a dream to prove exactly that and became an astronaut. It was a long journey, but I managed to fulfill my dream. I never would have guessed that my dream would become a nightmare. I guess we can't foresee fate.

I was part of Apollo 18, officially the last crew to ever travel to the moon. We didn't know that there was another reason to send one last expedition to the moon, nor did we know that we would never return. When my feet touched the surface of the moon, it was an unsurpassable feeling of surrealism. I was actually on our moon. This feeling of happiness was overshadowed by a feeling of pure horror, fear, desperation and panic within just two days. We had to watch as an asteroid destroyed the Earth. Brought to safety from the end of the world and yet I would have preferred to have died on Earth with my family.

The rest of my crew was driven mad by the grief and despair. They took off their helmets outside the capsule to end their lives. Knowing that I am the last human in the universe, knowing that I am stuck forever on this rock of a satellite, knowing that my family, friends, everyone I loved is dead and my home no longer exists, knowing that I have nowhere to go to escape this nightmare. A depressing place where there is nothing but dust and rock. And then I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. Instead, I sit here in the capsule, watching my supplies run out more and more every day, waiting for death. Why am I so afraid of dying? The eternal void can't be worse than this.

Why was I brought to the moon to survive when there is nothing I can do? I feel like I'm losing my mind. I keep hearing a knocking at the door. It started out as a light tapping. Now it's a real hammering. I also hear Mitch's voice. He begs me to let him in. It can't be him. He's dead. Like everyone else. I saw him take off his helmet. Damn it, I'm really going crazy. I have to ignore it. My mind is just playing tricks on me. The knocking stopped after about three hours, which I spent lying in my bedchamber covering my ears. I don't know exactly how, but I manage to fall asleep, and when I wake up, everything is quiet.

I guess I just needed some sleep. Maybe I can make the best of my situation and explore the moon a little closer. I put on my spacesuit and step outside. I think I'm too mentally broken to be frightened by the large scratches on the door and the inhuman footprints in the dust. In fact, I'm curious to see where they lead.
