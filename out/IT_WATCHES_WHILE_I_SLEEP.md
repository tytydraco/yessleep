A shrill laughter broke through the silence of night like ice cracking across a frozen lake. The laughter reverberated throughout the hallway outside my bedroom door. It was coming from downstairs. It's probably just my wife up late watching a show because she couldn't sleep, is what I'd like to say, but i live alone, and my wife died five years ago. 

I reached into my nightstand and grabbed my pistol. I strained to listen for more laughter or the sound of movement, but neither came. After hearing nothing for several minutes, i started to get out of bed, looking towards the door, which was cracked open slightly. What i saw promptly haulted any further movement from my body. A pair of small, glowing, silver eyes hovered seven feet off the ground, peering through the crack. They were perfect circles with no pupil,reflecting light that wasn't present. Their uwavering and unblinking gaze cut through the darkness of my room like a razor. How long had they been there? How long had they been watching me? Was i seeing things or dreaming? These thoughts flooded through my head like a bursting dam. Speechless and petrified, i could only watch as they slowly drifted into the darkness. Which was followed by the erie creeking of the stairs. 

I propelled myself out of bed raising my firearm in the direction of the door while screaming "Whoever the fuck you are you better get out of here before i shoot you!" No response. I cautiously approached the door and gently pulled the handle inward. As it creeked open i reached into the hall to turn on the light with my gun at the ready. Light began flooding the hallway. Adjusting my sight to the change in lighting i noticed footprints. Not on the floor but on the wall, scattered in all directions.They looked like they had once been wet but dried and stained in place. I shifted my focus to the stairs at the end of the hall. I steadily inched my way forward towards them, gun raised. The light from the hall clung to the beginning of the first four steps then tapered off into black. I could only imagine what lurked in the shadows below me. I wouldn't have to imagine for very long.

A deep sinister laughter erupted from below. I barreled down the stairs only for the laugh to cut off midway. Standing stranded in a sea of darkness with my feet resting on the cold floor, i could see nothing. It was pitch black, not even light shone through the windows being cast by streetlamps out front. 

My pulse echeoed through my ears. Noticing the rapid rapid rise and fall of my chest i took a deep breath and tried to steady myself. "WHAT DO YOU WANT?" I yelled as sweat dripped from my pinky onto the grip of the pistol. I should have never asked. In my own voice something from the corner of the ceiling said "You know what i want."
