Two weeks ago, I lost everything I've ever had. I find getting into specifics unnecessary, but I stumbled into a position I'd always found inconceivable. One I regarded as many others do - with an attitude of "*That could never happen to me*". Well, through a calamity of terribly bad luck and equally bad decisions, it did. 





Whilst frantically looking for a place to live, a new job and receipt of the disputed paycheck that served as the final blow to the unravelling of my old life, I found myself sleeping under a constantly traffic-infested bridge alongside a dozen or so other homeless people. Even in this position, I thought myself different to those I shared a living space with. Not better. Just *different*. I would get back on my feet. This was only temporary for me. I couldn't stomach comparing myself to Ed, who had woken up to this view of unsightly concrete every morning for 16 years. Or to Lisa, who had done the same for 30, with her weathered face testifying to this depressing truth. Nor to any of the others who I never had the chance to speak with but could tell they had trod this path for far too long. 



It became my mantra, repeated as I migrated from coffee shop to coffee shop whilst hunting down a new job and as I struggled to fall asleep with my mind regret-tinged and senses attacked from every direction in their struggle to adapt to this new environment. 



"*I will get back on my feet*".



And, just as things were slowly beginning to come together, the man showed up. The ever-present noise of the traffic above and the hubbub of conversation around late-November campfires kept us from hearing the thud of his weighty cane against the concrete until he was within speaking distance. He wore an amalgamated uniform of a tattered, filthy suit jacket and tie with a bottom half of pristine, creaseless dress pants and freshly polished shoes. He enticed all who resided under that bridge with a single sentence, spoken in a voice tinged with a giddy anticipation: 



"*Tickets to Salvation, available to all for the small price of your worldly possessions*!" 



Heads perked up and eyes shot glances at others as his words settled in. People were quietly excited, but confusion reigned king. "*What is a Ticket to Salvation?*" an elderly man who remains a stranger to me asked. The man simply repeated his announcement. He did so in response to every question we had as if he were a broken record of unclear promise. 



And soon after, the first desperate soul took him up on his offer. It was Ed. He was one of the few under that bridge I had spoken to at length, in no small part because the early days of his now accepted reality were eerily similar to mine - and as such he saw a version of himself long departed within me. He'd always told me that this wasn't the bottom. That it could get worse. That I should never fall into the tempting trap of acceptance, no matter how long I tried and failed to recapture what I had lost. I only wish I could have given him some wisdom, or failing that merely some comfort, back. 



The man plundered over to Ed before he had even finished his indication of willingness: "I'll take one off your hands", and soon cast his eyes upon Ed's threadbare, stained mattress and the scattered collection of his belongings lying on it. The man handed Ed a scrap of paper and promptly struggled to drag the mattress alongside him. I asked Ed to take a look at his ticket, but his demeanour changed and he refused. The man, meanwhile, enticed the remaining residents with a walk of assurance and that same vow of salvation. 



And every single one of them exchanged their assortments of belongings for a ticket. I tried to, willing to try anything by this point, when he said something... different for the first and last time. 



"*I apologise, Sir, but you aren't ready yet.*"



And with that, before I could form the words to retort, he and all those except me under that bridge went the way of the wind before my horrified gaze. Their final expressions were at first of slight happiness before distorting into a silent scream as they vanished into somewhere that remains unknown. The places they stood, *lived*, suddenly vacant where they had seconds prior been inhabited. I never saw any of them again. 



I went to the police, the media, and anybody who might've listened. But my tales were simply those of a man with nothing left to lose. I didn't have any evidence they ever existed. I didn't know any of those people beyond their first names. I didn't even know where most of them came from. 



But I do know one thing. 



Nobody comes to save those who have been forgotten.
