Every family has traditions; some might be stranger than others. I find myself reflecting on my own family's traditions as the date approaches again. You see in my family, on someone's birthday, after they turn sixteen, something unique happens. They are taken to a special place, to the family labyrinth.

It always happens, we are taken there and not by choice. Yet no one physically brings us there, it's not some prison or punishment that our elders inflict on us, rather we just.... end up there.

The place is hard to describe accurately; it's like trying to remember every little detail of a particularly bad dream. Just mentioning it brings up memories I would rather leave buried. But I know I must recall those memories now, not just for this account, but to prepare myself for what will happen soon.

I have to remember the stone halls, the dark recesses of every twisting corner. I have to remember the impossible stairs, leading everywhere and nowhere, the feeling of escape being impossible. Worst of all the moving shadows that gather all around and the voices, some foreign, some familiar, all mumbling and whispering for release.

Many members of my family have been lost. To what end? I don’t know, I only know that in less than forty eight hours, I will be back there again, and I pray I will find my way out before something happens.

I won’t bother trying to run away; no amount of distance will make any difference. My cousin Francis was brought back last year, despite having moved to Norway to try and get away.

No matter what we do, or where we go, it will find us and pull us in.

To this day I don’t know if it's some kind of hereditary curse. Family records are vague as to when this bizarre process started. Allegedly this has been happening for over two centuries. I’m surprised and impressed that enough of my ancestors were able to survive until they were old enough for the strange phenomenon that whisks us away, to leave them alone.

The one saving grace, and indeed the only reason I have a family tree at all, is that when someone reaches the age of twenty six, the pull stops. At that point they are safe and never get pulled back in again.

So survival means ten years of anxiety and the terrible reality of the labyrinth waiting for us. Many are able to survive, but the worst part is not the fear after returning. The worst part is that many family members who were taken, never came back.

In order to comfort and assist the people that do return, our tradition is to watch over the family mausoleum. The ancient building is a gateway of sorts. It is the exit from that realm of impossible nightmare, back to the real world.

Those that survive always emerge from the mausoleum, shivering, exhausted, sometimes bloody or broken, but mercifully alive. They are the ones who were able to find the small glint of light that heralded a true exit and deliverance from their imprisonment. Then there are the others.

We all know that if someone does not exit the mausoleum shortly after their birthday, they will likely never exit again. There is no food or water to be had in the shadowy halls. Only a slow death by dehydration or starvation as you stumble to uncover a way out.

I consider the fate of my family members and shudder. It's a grim irony that we emerge from a mausoleum when we survive, yet in death, no one can be found down there. The place is connected somehow, but not in a direct physical sense.

Francis survived. He made it out, but he emerged just like all the others, despite having been thousands of miles away when he was taken.

You won't be surprised to learn that we approach birthdays with fear and reservation. No celebration, no party, just planning for the unpredictable and prayers for safe returns. We do our best to prepare, but not much can really be done. Nothing can be taken in, nothing can be taken out, besides the clothes on our backs.

I was terrified when I turned sixteen, I still can't believe I found my way out. I had no true way to tell how long I was gone, but apparently it was just under twenty hours.

The next two times were awful but I tried to do something to trace my steps, to ease the passage out for next time if I could. But each time it happens I never wind up in the exact same spot.

None of the markers I left my second year, were there for my third. No other trace of any other family members could be found either, at least not alive. No markers, clues, hints or totems on how to find the way out. The desperation to find escape, mixed with the claustrophobic and solitary search is profoundly unsettling, but we all have to endure if we ever want to see daylight again. Despite the terrible solitude of the experience, there are whispered stories of voices and shapes in the perpetual darkness. But none who have returned, can ever really say for sure.

I grow more anxious, considering the fate of my brothers, sisters and cousins. I sometimes wonder why our family would have so many children, knowing the curse that we are all destined to endure.

“The labyrinth is a test.” My father said. It is a curse, but it can be a blessing as well. Indeed the ones that survive all ten years, have moved on to become successful and influential people.

One day I asked my dad why we have to go, but he admits he doesn't really know. He endured his ten years and he hinted that he had almost died on more than one occasion.

He was not sure if he even wanted children after what he had gone through, but was convinced by his parents.

Despite his reservations he ended up meeting my mother and to her credit, she stayed with him and had a family, despite the very real curse they knew they would have to endure. I can still barely believe the stories of the people who marry into our family, but love makes you do crazy things I suppose.

I also remember asking my dad if the point of the labyrinth was just escape, or if we were supposed to do something or find something while we were trapped.

He did not know exactly. But he told me that many years ago someone once saw a secret chamber that was not an exit, but contained the source of this curse. Rumors sprung up around the idea and supposedly if anyone ever made it inside, the curse might be broken and the rest of us would be free.

It is comforting to think there could be a secret to help keep our family safe and end the nightmare we have endured all these years. But I have never seen such a room, no one else, at least in my generation has either. I know I cannot count on finding it, I know I have to do what I did the last few years and just survive.

I push the glimmer of hope for a possible end to the curse away for now. I know it's no use, all I can do is prepare myself, physically and mentally, for what comes next. My birthday is in forty eight hours and I don’t think I’m ready, how could anyone ever be ready?

As I consider my preparation, I am reminded of my cousin Jamie. His eighteenth birthday was two days ago and he has not come back yet. My brother Jake and I have a job to do. It's our turn to watch the mausoleum. We are hoping to see Jaime emerge soon. We watch and watch, and when we grow tired our father and uncle Ken will take over. I pray that Jaime is alright, people have returned after longer than two days, but for most, if they cannot return within the first twenty four hours, they never return.

We sit in silence at a small table set up near the mausoleum. Jake tries to distract from our grim duty and talk about a show he has been watching. I entertain the banter, but we both know how grim the circumstance is. Neither of us will say it, but we both suspect that Jaime is not coming back.

We wait for another few hours, biding our time but never leaving the mausoleum unattended. When Jake had to leave for the bathroom, I slip back into my reverie. I hopelessly consider any memories that might ensure my own survival, when I am pulled back into the labyrinth myself.

Before I can reminisce too long I hear movement. The stone door slowly opens and my heart leaps. He was alright, Jaime made it!

Then I look at the figure crawling on the ground, hunched and disheveled. It was Jaime, but something is wrong, something happened. He crawls along the ground because the legs he drags behind him look mangled and broken. I jump up and rush over to help and I hear his whimpers. When I look at his face I nearly scream, his eyes were missing, something removed his eyes! I call for help as loud as I can and try not to panic as I attempt to render what little aid I can for my injured cousin.

He made it back, but at what cost? My father arrives and then my uncle Ken. He screams as he sees the state his son is in. He holds it together long enough for us to carry him to the table and give him water and assess the entire, terrible scope of his injuries.

“Get Daniel down here now!” My uncle Ken growled and Jake ran upstairs to retrieve their eldest brother. My Uncle Dan is a doctor and is not normally required to use his skills to help us, but when there is a birthday he will often stay nearby in case someone does return injured. He finally arrives and sees the state Jaime is in. He shakes his head, admitting the ability to help is beyond his ability.

“We need to take him to an actual hospital.” Dan says as stoically as he can while looking at the ruin of Jamie's prone form.

Uncle Ken and my father leave to take Jaime to the hospital, which fortunately is not too far. No emergency call is made, less people less questions. I doubt I will ever know what story they will tell the hospital on what could have happened to leave Jaime in that state and I am glad I do not have to come up with it.

I think about what could have done that and I wonder if it will be there when I am forced to wander the halls of the labyrinth all too soon. Only one day left until I see for myself.
