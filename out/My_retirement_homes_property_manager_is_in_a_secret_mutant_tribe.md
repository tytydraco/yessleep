My wife and I moved into a fancy place for old people right before the pandemic. It’s a 55+ co-op for people like us willing to pay the HOA fees for an on-premises movie theatre, restaurant, golf course, and all kinds of other amenities that cost an arm and a leg.

We had almost a year to enjoy our new home before the coronavirus. Both of us were old enough to be at risk, but it was her lungs, not mine, that a respiratory infection collapsed. She died in our new home.

I still live here but, economically speaking, our co-op never really recovered from the pandemic. At one point, the trash blocked up every disposal chute in the building because the board didn’t have the money to pay maintenance men.

The building was in dire straits when the current owner bought it in an all-cash deal. The ink hadn’t yet dried on the transfer deed when new management showed up.

They turn things around very quickly.

I was happy that the hallways didn’t smell like garbage anymore. The golf simulator, pool, and sauna in my building all reopened, too.

But I did not care for the new property manager, Chance. He had oily, slicked-back hair like guys who chew toothpicks and live off the usury of payday loans. He wore a black wool suit, even when it was summer. The diffuse scents of carrion and oiled leather followed him wherever he went.

One day he asked me if I could meet him in his office to discuss an “opportunity”. In my experience, people who offer opportunities are looking for one themselves, and I was too old to pull up someone else’s bootstraps for them.

But after further reflection, I agreed to meet him. I was a retiree in a failing building and had no plausible excuse not to go.

“Please, please, sit,” Chance said. “Do you mind if I call you Irvin?”

“It’s my name,” I said, sitting across from him.

There was a very large vacuum-resealable bag of “edible insects” sitting on his desk. I’d never seen anyone eat bugs unless it was on television for a prize.

He saw me eyeing up the bag. “Do you want to try some?”

I said, “You know, I try not to eat anything that crawls.”

“Not even crabs?”

I frowned. “How can I help you, Chance?”

“Right down to business.” He dusted the dried insects’ seasoning off his fingers. It smelled like fish food. “I can respect that. My old man hated chit-chat, too.”

“Must skip a generation,” I said.

“Anyhow, there are some new changes that the co-op is making, and I wanted to get your input before the next board meeting.”

“I thought that your company buying the co-op meant you don't have to listen to the board.”

“Yes, that’s true,” he said, pulling what looked like an electric blanket onto his lap from below his desk. It was already seventy-eight degrees in his office. “But I think it’s better for everybody if we make a good faith effort to get on the same page.”

“Okay, fine. But I’m not on the board. What do you need me for?”

“You’re a veterinarian.”

I raised an eyebrow. I hadn’t been a veterinarian since the nineties. 

I’d mentioned my practice exactly zero times since my wife died. And there was a good reason for that. If a bunch of old biddies think you can fix their Malteses’ bowel obstructions, they will chase you to your doorstep till you do it.

“So?” I said.

Chance opened his laptop and something on-screen broadened his smile. 

“Did you write *Yearly Variations in the Ovarian Cycle of the Lizard Varanus komodoensis*?” He turned his laptop screen toward me so I could see. It was a PDF of the article I wrote for the 1975 Journal of Herpetology.

I was astonished. And, frankly, because all old men are lonely and desperate for someone to praise their past deeds, somewhat flattered. “Where’d you find that?”

“Listen, Irvin,” Chance said, turning his laptop toward him again, “you’re an important part of what we’re trying to do here.” He started scribbling on a piece of paper. “This is the address we’ll be meeting at, tonight at eight. I think it’ll be worth your time to come.” He handed it to me.

I was confused. What was happening? 

Chance’s desk phone rang. He picked it up and started talking like I was no longer there.

I left his office, having no clue what any of this was about.

•

It was a Chinese restaurant called Wū Lóng Eatery. And it was inside an actual pagoda. Its several floors built into a tower of multiple tiers with overhanging eaves. Close up, I saw the whole building was made of wood.

How had I not noticed a place like this? I’d been to this neighborhood a thousand times.

Inside, Wū Lóng was decorated in the Chinoiserie that you associate with socialites who ban people without costumes from their costume parties. A woman with the lithe frame and height of a model waited at a hostess stand with a red symbol carved into its wood front: 

恶

I’m not one to notice this sort of thing, but the hostess had a terrible complexion. Flakes came off of her face, neck, arms, fingers—everywhere. There was a single piece of dead skin in the unbroken shape of a whole ear hanging off of one of her earlobes. 

I was shocked, because other than her bad skin, she was good looking to a nearly extraterrestrial degree (you know the type, people so beautiful it’s frightening to speak with them).

“Irvin,” Chance called to me from just behind a lattice wood screen carved with fancy fretwork. He was wearing his same black wool suit, even though it was hot enough for a late-night swim.

I waved and walked over. “Quite a place.”

“Oh yes,” he said, placing his arm around my shoulder to bring me along with him, “Wū Lóng is an old haunt of ours. So few restaurants cater to our kind.”

“You mean property managers?”

“Ha! You’re a rascal, Irvin. Right this way…”

He walked me into a private room the size of a basketball court. The walls were all *shoji* screens with paper panes. He slid one of the *shoji* doors shut once we were inside.

Every surface was stone, and the floor sank down in descending rows of bench seating like in theatre in the round. It was an amphitheatre inside the floor. People with the same alien good looks and eczematous skin as the hostess filled every row. In the middle, at the very bottom, there was a wading pool filled with dark green water.

What was a room like this doing inside a restaurant? 

My instinct was to flee. But I’m far too old and far too well socialized to behave based on instinct.

“Come, Irvin, come, come,” Chance nudged me forward a little harder than I would’ve liked. A woman with arms as long as my legs pulled me down next to her at the top row of seating.

The woman flicked her tongue at me; it was as gray as it was pink and bifurcated as deeply as a barbeque fork. I tried to get up, but Chance gripped my shoulders from behind and bore down with his weight.

“What the hell are you doing?” I wasn’t screaming yet. But I would be.

The others in the amphitheatre swayed in circles in their seats. And they chanted. They chanted human syllables through inhuman vocal cords. I didn’t know the language but the words were loud and clear. They kept saying, “salah satu dari kami, salah satu dari kami, salah satu dari kami…”

A group trance.

“Hold him!” Chance screamed at the fork-tongued woman.

She slithered in closer and wrapped palm-frond arms around my narrow chest. She licked me as something dropped off of her face. It was a piece of dead skin the exact size and shape of her lip. It fell on the ground beside us, white and deflated like an empty cocoon.

She smiled and it was grotesque. It looked like she had livid gums with cactus spines trying to push through from underneath where teeth were supposed to be. She leaned closer. She whispered in my ear: “I’ve been laying my eggs asexually. All the boys die when they hatch. If we mate, then I can have a girl—she will live!”

“I want him!” Another fork-tongued creature hissed from below; it could have been either male or female, I don’t know.

“He’s mine!” A female screamed from a few tiers further down.

A very large male rushed me like a defensive end trying to sack a quarterback. His skin was scaled. His head was the shape of a brick, and his forked tongue was twice as long as the first female’s. He pushed her aside. He held me down. His hand swiped across my abdomen. I felt a sharp sting. I saw five parallel slash marks seeping red through my button-down shirt.

I started screaming. “Chance! Chance!” I couldn’t think of who else to scream for; at least he was someone I knew.

More of the creatures shook themselves out of their trance. Their bodies gyrated, limbs bashing the stone surfaces, their arms and legs spasming—a bizarre, copulatory dance. Their rhythm was as discomposing as physical violence.

The male wasn’t in control of himself, if he ever had been. He slashed me with his claw two more times. I saw my blood pouring out of me. “Oh my God! Chance! Please, anyone—someone help me!”

The male licked my face as he mauled me. Three females tore at my body trying to get me away from him. “No, no! It hurts, please, please…” I was being removed from consciousness by blood loss.

One of the females pulled me with her gummy, spiny teeth. She didn’t free me from the frenzied male, but bit off two of my fingers. Blood sprayed. The entranced group seemed to smell my blood. The copper penny scent snapped them out of reverie.

“ENOUGH!” The voice was a crocodilian bellow and an aged woman’s rasp.

My assailants scuttered away. The creatures who’d been bobbing and chanting suddenly sat frozen in their seats.

My belly was sore, wet, and warm. There were many deep gashes. The blood from my missing fingers didn’t gush as hard as when they’d been bitten off.

I looked toward the voice—in the wading pool, the surface clouded over with steam. I saw a body break through, saw a triangular head on an overlong neck between steep-sloping shoulders.

Chance was next to me now, roughly shoving my three attackers away and hissing at them. The three cowered before him. Chance was naked, though what he had between his legs was a reptile hemipene and not a human penis

The creature stepped up from the wading pool’s mist. When I saw her, I almost felt relief, because though her body had the squat limbs and elongated body of a lizard, she stood on legs; her flesh was the peach-blonde-pink of human flesh, and her silver hair was in fact silver human hair. And she wore a very human thing to wear—a skirted one-piece bathing suit in a floral print pattern, just like any grandma taking an Aqua Zumba class at the Y.

In my delirium, I almost laughed at the thought that popped into my head: “Komodo Grandma.”

“I have brought him to you,” Chance said, lifting me from under my armpits like he was picking up a baby. “The *ayah*. I’ve brought him to you, *Ratu Naga*.”

Komodo Grandma sucked through her teeth in disapproval. “For all the good it does me. The children have got at him! Do I need a disemboweled husband?”

“Husband…?” I was weak, barely able to speak, vision swimming. But I was still conscious.

She got on her belly and crawled up tier to tier. She slinked in right beside me. None of the others were as reptilian as Komodo Grandma. Was that why they cowered in fear of her? They were like hyperactive kids busting open a supply of paint in a rainbow over clean, white walls.

A black border was closing in around my field of vision. I smelled and tasted the iron of my own blood in the air. 

I struggled to breathe. Komodo Grandma placed her hand on my chest. The fingers on her hands were each almost exactly the same size as any other. Nails extruded from her fingers in actual claws.

“You’re dying,” she said to me. I could smell rotten meat on her breath. Her voice was all squall and groan. “I’m very sorry about that. The children are excitable. Especially because Chance—” she looked over at my co-op’s property manager with the superior look of a matriarch “—told them all about the lizard doctor.” She pantomimed conspiracy and spoke to me behind her claw, “I think they thought you were a lizard-in-fact who was also a doctor.”

“I don’t understand…” I coughed blood.

Komodo Grandma sighed. It sounded like someone emptying water from a slide whistle. “None of us really understand, Irvin. But here’s what you need to know for right now. You’re dying, and I can save you. But you have to become one of us.”

“I—”

“Don’t speak yet,” she said, the huddle of humanoid reptiles crowding in around her like campers listening to ghost stories around a bonfire. “You can say something when it’s to save your life.”

“My wife…” I didn’t want to, but I cried.

Komodo Grandma patted my chest. “...will always be your wife, Irvin. I’m just trying to save her husband. And maybe get something from you in return.” Her stubby, thick fingers pinched my wrist and she slide-whistle-sighed again. “Your pulse is going, Irvin. You’re going to have to choose.”

“What’s your name?” I asked.

“Tuti,” Komodo Grandma said.

“That’s a nice name. My wife’s name was Marybeth.”

“Okay, Irvin. That’s a nice name. Okay. But you’re losing a lot of blood. I can’t force you to choose, but I can’t save you unless you choose ‘yes’. This is what they mean when they say ‘under the gun’.” She caressed my cheek with her lizard’s paw. “So what’s it going to be, doc?”

I looked at Tuti, and saw a wonderful and ugly smile. I looked at Chance, holding his wool suit in his arms like a security blanket—when had he gone and got that? Everything was questions. The world was confusion, words were escaping. I saw Tuti’s tribe watch us with the anticipation of children watching mom cut the birthday cake. I thought of my wife alone in a hospital bed. I thought of the lockdown and no one at her funeral. I thought of our wedding and the vain arguments of our young marriage, the whole world in front of us and us unable to see it, because what young couple could? And I wondered what she would say to me now, my wife Marybeth, wondered what she’d tell me to do. I wondered. Then I closed my eyes… 

And I made my decision.

All hail Komodo Grandpa.
