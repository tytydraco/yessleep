“The Red Room”

By the third week, I’d stopped eating entirely. Not because I didn’t want to, but because I couldn’t. Every bite of food felt like ash in my mouth. Even water tasted wrong, metallic and thick, like it was laced with blood. The smell in the apartment had evolved into something that felt alive. It wasn’t just rot anymore; it was rancid, sulfuric, almost acidic. It clung to the back of my throat, making me gag with every breath. I called the landlord again. His phone was disconnected. Then, one night, I heard it clearly: a voice. It wasn’t the whispering I’d heard before. This was deeper, guttural, a low growl that rumbled through the walls. It said my name.

“Ethan.”

I didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt something watching me, its gaze heavy and oppressive, like a thousand invisible hands pressing against my skin. And then, the door appeared. The red door wasn’t just a door. It was a wound. The wood looked more like raw flesh, its surface slick with a thin layer of glistening blood. Veins throbbed beneath the surface, pulsating in rhythm with the low hum that filled the hallway.

It called to me.

The sound wasn’t a whisper anymore. It was a chorus, hundreds of voices overlapping, some screaming, some crying, others laughing in high, hysterical tones. They spoke in languages I didn’t recognize, yet I understood every word. “You belong to us,” they said. I tried to leave. I grabbed my keys and ran for the door, but the hallway stretched infinitely in both directions. No matter how far I ran, I always ended up back at the red door. I stared at it for hours, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might stop.

And then it opened.

The room was alive.

The walls weren’t just made of flesh, they were suffering. They quivered and twitched, grotesque faces pushing through the surface, their mouths stretching wide as they screamed. Eyes rolled wildly in their sockets, their gazes darting toward me before disappearing back into the pulsing mass. The floor was covered in a thick, black sludge that clung to my shoes and made sucking noises with every step. It smelled like sulfur and decay, the air so heavy with heat it felt like I was breathing fire. In the center of the room was the chair. It was worse than I remembered. The bones that made up its frame were now jagged and yellow, some of them still dripping with marrow. The seat was a patchwork of human faces, their features twisted in agony, their mouths moving silently as if begging for mercy.

But it wasn’t empty.

The thing sat there, waiting for me. It was no longer just a humanoid figure. It had grown. Its limbs were longer now, bending at impossible angles. Its torso was stretched and hollow, revealing a ribcage filled with writhing, black worms. Its face was still featureless, except for its mouth. Rows upon rows of jagged teeth glistened inside, some of them broken, others impossibly long, curling outward like the fangs of a serpent “Ethan,” it said, its voice a guttural snarl that seemed to echo inside my skull. “You came home.” I tried to turn and run, but the door was gone. The walls began to close in, the faces pressing closer, their screams merging into an endless, deafening wail. The thing stood, its movements jerky and unnatural, like a puppet being pulled by invisible strings. It reached out a clawed hand, and I felt something cold wrap around my chest.

“I’ve waited for you,” it said.

“For what?” I choked, tears streaming down my face.

“To create,” it hissed.

The floor opened beneath me. I fell into darkness. When I woke up, I was strapped to the chair. The skin stuck to my body, slick and warm, wrapping around me like it was alive. Veins coiled around my wrists and ankles, tightening until I felt my bones creak. The thing loomed over me, its mouth stretching impossibly wide as it reached inside itself. It pulled out a blade. The knife wasn’t metal. It looked like bone, curved and serrated, dripping with black liquid that hissed and sizzled as it hit the ground. It carved into me slowly. I felt everything. Every slice, every tear, every pull of my flesh as it peeled my skin away layer by layer. My screams echoed through the room, but they were drowned out by the sound of the walls laughing.

“You’ll be perfect,” it said.

I begged for it to stop. I begged to die. But it wasn’t interested in mercy. It opened my chest, snapping my ribs one by one. The pain was blinding, consuming, but I didn’t black out. I couldn’t. It reached inside me, pulling out my organs with a sickening squelch. My heart. My lungs. My intestines. It removed them all, replacing them with writhing masses of black worms that burrowed into my flesh, their sharp teeth gnawing at my insides. “Now,” it said, stepping back to admire its work. “You’re ready.” The walls split open, revealing a world of endless torment. The sky was red, choked with smoke and fire. Rivers of molten lava carved through the landscape, filled with writhing bodies that screamed as they burned. I could see them, the others. People I knew. People I’d never met. Their faces twisted in agony as they were torn apart by creatures that defied comprehension. The thing lifted me from the chair and carried me to the edge of the abyss. “You are mine now,” it said, its voice echoing with ancient power. “And you will help me bring others.”

It threw me into the flames.

I didn’t die.

I became something else. My body burned, twisted, reshaped by the fire. My skin turned black and cracked, my eyes replaced with glowing red orbs. My fingers grew into claws, my mouth filled with sharp, jagged teeth. I was no longer human. I was part of the red room. Now, I’m waiting. The door is still there, and it’s calling for someone new. When they enter, I’ll be the one to greet them. 

And I’ll make sure they never leave.
