I’m not sure how to start this post. For context, my 32m name is Thomas Blakely, and I moved to a rural town called Tarrahue about two weeks ago to begin working as an officer. Back where I’m from, there was a surplus of candidates for the relatively small city, so the call was given for surplus officers to take up positions in places around the state. Being a 32 year old with no other options or real experience in any other field, I didn’t really have a choice but to accept. I moved here with my 34f long-time girlfriend, Avery, and at first it seemed great, ideal, even. Tarrahue has that small-town feel, you know? The kinda one that feels like a simpler time, where everyone knows everyone else’s names. So when we got here, I was in high spirits! That is until, I came in to work for the first day to see an empty station, with a crumpled old note on the floor. I picked it up and started to read it, and it goes as follows.

Hey kid, congratulations on making it this far. You’ve just become an officer of the Tarrahue county police force. The name’s Deputy Blackwood and I will be in charge of your orientation. We’re a small town, but don’t let that fool you. Tarrahue can be a beast that’ll chew up and spit up kids like you if you ain’t careful. To get started I will run you through some basic, but essential, rules for the job.

Rule 1:

Keep a gun handy. Unfortunately, Tarrahue county ain’t supplied with firearms for every officer. Officially, we aren’t really supposed to use em’ outside of emergency cases, but ain’t no one gonna enforce that rule here, ‘specially not the chief. I recommend a small handgun, get’s the job done good enough. It’s essential to have one on you when engaging in active combat, as protecting the civilians comes before all else. And, should it come to it, to spare you the pain.

Rule 2:

Never follow the scream. Yes, ’the’ scream and not ‘a‘ scream. We say it here because you’ll know the difference when you hear it. We ain’t got no clue what it is or what it comes from, but it sure as hell ain’t human, at least anymore. Think of the scream like the lure of an anglerfish. Any officer I’ve seen gone to check it out ain’t been seen since. I mean, all except the chief that is.

Rule 3:

We all ignore the painting in the break room. If you value your life you’ll do the same. It was normal, at least at first. Brought in by Officer Thompson’s wife after he passed. Said his grandma made it home as a tribute, and that he’d want it to be here. Seemed pretty average at first. It showed Thompson from the waist up, clutchin’ white lillies. But it… changed. Whatever‘s holdin’ them flowers now, it ain’t him.

Rule 4;

always offer help to nightime visitors. we get them a lot here, and it’s almost always because they are in danger. they can be shy though, so invite them inside the station.

Rule 5:

Never use the stairs. We don’t have a second floor. I’ve seen countless good men go up, and when they come back, they come back in pieces. If you wanna claim the body of a friend who took a trip up the stairway, you can find em’ behind the building. I think that’s where the thing dumps it’s leftovers.

Rule 6:

If you meet anyone that calls themselves a member of the Grenville family, run. The entire family died of a gas leak in 2008, and what they left behind sure ain‘t friendly. If you do talk to one, and they invite you to dinner, it’s too late. You’ve been marked, and it’s a helluva lot better to end things on your own terms on the spot.

Rule 7:

Tip the janitors. Nobody got a clue who hired em’ but they sure as hell do good work. But they ain’t exactly what you’d call human, and if you don’t give em’ that tip you’ll face the consequences.

Rule 8:

The woods are not your friend. Nothing in Tarrahue is really, but there’s something in those trees that wants to see you suffer far more than the creatures that prowl the streets. Under no situation are you ever to enter them.

Rule 9:

If you see a shadowy figure in the corner of your eye, the best way to trick it is to stand perfectly still. After a few minutes it should move in to new prey.

Rule 10:

If you see a civilian sitting alone on the bench outside, ask em’ for their name. Be very careful, take note of how they tell you. Some things here can mess with your mind. Watch their mouthes. If they don’t move or open as they speak, tell them you have to respond to an urgent call and quickly get away.

Rule 11;

the broom close it what you’d call a ‘safe zone’. if in any danger, head directly there and tell nobody.

Rule 12:

At night, leave the door open. The strangers will be looking for places that are trying to hide. If they believe you’ve been harvested already they ain’t gonna bother you further. Same goes for the police station if you’re on night duty.

Rule 13:

Never enter the chief’s office without permission. It don’t take kindly to uninvited guests.

I s’pose that covers it for now. I‘ll be in to the station in the next couple of days or so to help you get your head ’round the job. In the meantime, I’m aware you’ve been assigned your daily beat check. Stick to the rules and you’ll be fine. Pleasure to have you aboard rookie.

PS. Before I go, I’ve noticed some rules have been altered. Ignore any rule startin’ with a semi colon or without capitals.

I didn’t know what to think about the strange note. It had to be some sort of prank. Maybe someone from the station had put it there to scare me. But it had such an unsettling sincerity to it. I decided to take a look around the police station to see if I could find any fellow officers that could shed some light on the situation. From were I was standing, in what I assumed to be the bullpen, there was nobody else here. But it wasn’t like the place had been abandoned. It was spotless, and well maintained. The desks were neat and each housed a collection of personal items, files, stationery, all the normal stuff that you would expect. I decided to do some further investigation. I’m a cop after all, and I might as well put my training to good use. I entered what I guessed was the briefing room. It was again, spotless and just as I would have expected. The desks were arranged single file in 4 neat lines that spanned to the very back of the room. I remember thinking how strange it was that such an empty place seemed like it was made to accommodate so many people.

After checking out several more rooms I made my way back to the lobby were I had first come in, to see if there was any sign of someone arriving from outside. However, as I stepped towards to outside doors I felt a cold chill run across my neck. I turned around to see a set of stairs behind me. Just like the note said, the stairs led right into darkness. I looked up and down the hall to make sure there was no-one else around. Once I confirmed that I began to ascend the steps, slowly, one step at a time. I was just about to place my foot on the top step, and enter the dark void that faced me when a shout came from behind me.

“What the hell do you think you’re doing?!” The voice cried.

Suddenly, as if a spell had broken I ripped myself away from the darkness and half ran, half fell down the staircase. A low, angry growl came from the top and the stairs faded away, as if they had never been there. 

“What the hell was that?” I asked as I stumbled forward.

“Damn rookies, always getting themselves into stupid situations,” she said, angrily, “Didn’t the note tell you not to take the stairs??”

Before me stood a tall woman, with dark skin and died purple dreadlocks that draped across her shoulders. She wore a deputies uniform, and had an air of authority around her despite how young she seemed.

“I-I’m sorry…”I started, “I don’t know what came over me, I-“

“Save it, it’s not entirely your fault. I know it can be hard to understand.” She pulled me to my feet and dusted my shoulders. 

“My name is Amanda Robinson. I’m a deputy here. You’re Blakely, right? The new recruit?” She said.

“Yeah, that’s me.” I quivered. 

Amanda sighed and shook her head.

“Figures Blackwood wouldn’t bother to show up. You’ll notice that he tends not to stick around, and neither do most of the others.”

“So why did you come in?” I asked.

“Because, unlike the rest of the staff, I actually care about the safety of my officers. I heard that you were starting and I couldn’t leave you by yourself.” She grinned, showing off a row of sharp teeth.

“Well, thank you for that at least. It’s nice to meet you.” I smiled.

“Likewise. Now, I recommend you take it easy. It can be hard to adjust and you might need some time. Go home.” She advised.

“Thanks, I think I will.” I replied, leaving.

As I walked away I thought back to the message I had received. It had sounded like a joke to begin with, but there was something about it that chilled my spine. And my encounter with the staircase had all but proved it. But if that was the case, why did it seem so unprofessional? Officer Robinson had been helpful I guess, but she was the only person there. Hell, I was greeted with a note and an empty building when I arrived. How could a town, apparently so plagued with monsters have such lax security?! However, just as I became lost in my thoughts, a man grabbed my shoulder and I spun around.

“Hiya! Haven’t seen you here yet, you must be new!” Said the man.

He wore a strained smile stretched across his lips as to not reveal his teeth. His eyes stared with an intensity that put me off straight away. There was something sinister about him, as if he was hiding a deep secret. He had short brown hair that curled slightly around his face and a moustache that covered both his upper lip and chin.

“I am. I’m Thomas, new police officer.” I replied with hesitation.

“Blakely huh? Well that sounds like a mouthful, maybe you should get a nickname! I’m Maxwell, Maxwell Grenville. Pleasure to meet you!” 

As he said this a chill ran down my spin. He grinned wide, baring sharped rotten teeth that oozed a viscous black liquid. His eyes burned into my soul, and in that moment I knew what it was to be prey. His grip tightened across my arm and his sharp fingernails dug into my skin. The note had warned me of the Grenville family, and as I gazed up into the face pressed close to mine, I could smell the death that sprung from his every pore. I tried to break free but he held me fast. As he spoke he leaned closer, his breath hot against my ear.

“It has been a long time since we have tasted fresh blood. You will be our meal tonight.”
