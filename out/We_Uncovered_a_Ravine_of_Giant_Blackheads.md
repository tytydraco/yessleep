Finding land was always the hardest part of owning a construction company.  Every time I seemingly found the perfect lot, I’d always find something that fucked it all up.  It was back to square one after that.  All the useful lots were usually taken by some greedy whippersnapper farmers that were left a little nest egg.  My small town was quickly growing, and adding new housing was critical.  Furthermore, with the budget heading on a one way trip to oblivion, I needed to find good land to buy.

While I sucked down my eighty-seventh-and-a half coffee of the day in a caffeine filled rage, I noticed a FOR SALE CHEAP sign sticking out on the soil.  Some old geezer sat right beside it with his rinky-dink rusty RV.

My workers and I hooted and hollered at our find from the cockpits of their excavators; our business would live another day.  We’d finally managed to hit the jackpot.

Or, at least I thought I did.Instead of being eager or excited about selling the land, his eyes were bloodshot, his lower jaw permanently stuck out in a troglodyte fashion, and his outstretched hand was shaking and rattling like a leaf.

Getting out of my truck, I waltzed over to the old man.  “How much for the land?” I said.

“Eighty bucks…” The old man croaked.

My eyes widened.  This had to be some kind of dream.  I shrugged at my workers.  “Why is the price so low?”

The geezer pointed off towards the northwest.  My eyes scanned a patch of…something.

Fissures and pits dug into a beige spot with some occasional splotches of purple.  Its edges were smooth, blending in with the grass in patches like the contours on army camouflage pants.  Its perimeter could not be determined, but it was at least 50 feet wide.  The indentations held a soup of dirt and backwash, making the whole mass resemble a giant partially eaten saltine cracker.

Mother nature liked to use our town as her pissing ground, so flooding, rain and washed up junk wasn’t uncommon.  But it didn’t explain how irregular the whole surface was.  That didn’t matter, though; even if the land was crap, I still could make do.

“It looks like a boring patch of sandstone.  That’s it?  That’s what you are so worried about?  You’ve got a deal!” I said to the seller.  Exchanging money for the land, he limped off to his RV and proceeded to floor it.

I turned to my workers.  All they did in response was exchange glances about the rock formation.  I rested my finger under my chin.

Kneeling on the ground to investigate the patch, I tugged at the surface.  A sheet of translucent material gummed up my gloves when I scratched the surface.  Peeling off a piece, I held it up to the clear blue sky.  Scratches marked its surface, leaving it chalky and brittle like talc.

Then, something caught my eye.  Pink rings covered the pits right where the semisolid muck breached the surface.  I crouched on all fours.  Sandstone could come in multiple colors and unique layers, but the sides looked…

Raw, slippery, and unnaturally shiny.

“Bring a jackhammer,” I demanded.  Someone came over, waddling with the heavy tool, plugging it in and activating the steel beast.

They shoved the drill bit into one of the pinkish borders.  With a switch flick, it activated, burring into it.  The worker grits their teeth, trying to steady it.  The liquid in the pores splashed around in mini tsunamis.  Suddenly, the ground shook underneath.  There’s no way it could have come from the jackhammer; the activity was much too intense.  I scratched my neck and stroked my beard.

It was nothing greater than a few small subterranean tremors.  The thing was, earthquakes weren’t common around here.  The town was in the middle of the Midwestern United States, completely away from any tectonic plates.  When the activity ceased, the pink walls didn’t have any dents.

Adjusting my hard hat, I facepalmed.  Sandstone would have crumbled with little effort.

“What kind of rock is this?” I thought.  The situation was just a minor setback, though.  More firepower was needed.  It was time to blow something up.

“Get the M80’s…” I ordered.

One of the workers brought a bag filled with the bombs. They almost resembled stringy worms jutting out of explosive, deformed apples.  I took out my cigarette lighter, picking out one of the M80s and throwing it into the middle of the pitting.

“Take cover!” I barked.  We dove away from the ravine, bracing for it.  Then, it blew up, sending the mixture of dirt and water skyrocketing to the sides and raining down in brown snowballs.  Getting out of my huddle, I investigated the results.  The ground rumbled once more, the tremors far more intense than before.

The dirt had jettisoned from the ravines and holes, but the surface itself still remained intact.  I groaned.  “Well, shit,” I muttered.  Pacing around the parameter of the flesh-colored stone, I thought up a plan.  The merged holes were large enough to fit some men inside, but they were too narrow to fit a scoop.

Then, one finally hatched.

“Bring out some slack lines!  I want the area cleaned and dug up by the end of the day!”“Yes, sir!”

\---

Ten men were sent into the pits, glowing bungee cords wrapped around their waists.  Each were armed with massive drills and a large bucket.  After a few hours of digging, the smell of rotting onions wafted deep within the pits.  When I looked down inside, the topsoil was completely removed, replaced with nothing but a steaming, yellow-white chowder.

“Did I just uncover a sulfur pit?”  I wondered.  Though our town was known for mining, we’ve never uncovered any rocks like these.  We were known for mining salt and coal, not sulfur.  Of course, running into unwanted sedimentary rock was normal in a mining operation.  When I took a closer look, my workers’ boots were sinking in…muck?  So much for my conclusion about sulfur.

Tying a rope around my waist, I repelled down for an inspection.  My boots squished the thick white tar, surrounding the sides of the wall.  I stuck my hand into the concoction and gave it a sniff.  Throwing it on the ground with a plop, I covered my nose in disgust.

“What the hell is that stuff?!  Smells like burning sweat socks!” I exclaimed.

“Should we continue our work?  Seems kind of sketchy.  I mean, this doesn’t look like much of a rock formation to me,” a worker asked.

I gazed at the rim of my hardhat.  “Ok, this obviously isn’t going to work out.”  I glanced up at the hot sun.  Raising a hand to my face, I try to make out if there were any other good sources of land.  All around us for miles were hundreds of corn farms.  Getting a permit to take the land a la eminent domain was out of the question.  That law-based bullshit would take way too long.  Even then, there was no way I could convince those other farmers to fork over some land.  My company needed profits and fast.  “Keep digging.  I’ll be gone for an hour.”

As I got into my car, I requested a right hand man to keep watch while I traveled to the nearest hardware store.  While I got back on the road, I caught another formation resembling the ravines and pits back at the main site.  I squinted at the formation, surmising about what to do with that section.  Maybe it was my chance to acquire even more land and possibly save the company?

\---

By the time I got back, the holes had doubled in size.  When I peered down into the pockets, all that showed up was a black void.  The fluids inside had drained away, leaving only a crust of dirt and that same creamy slime on the sides.  I tied one of the harnesses around me, attaching a cable from a winch to the front and attached a bright yellow flashlight to my hat.  I jerked my head to the side, demanding that others follow.

“Sir, I don’t think this is a good idea…” A coworker says, holding up a finger.

“This is the last place we can afford.  If we don’t get any profits, this company AND US ALL go under.  I’m not doing this for just myself.  I’m doing this all for every one of you!  So get to work!”  I snapped, pointing off to the other formation.  “And while we descend, send another excavation team to that other rock formation way over yonder.  Maybe that will help us find a way to get rid of this formation.”

Instantly, they all put on their harnesses and activated their lights.  I position myself over the edge of a hole, just big enough for me and one other to enter.  With a thumbs up, the winches unwound.  As I pressed my boots against the unknown rock wall, tremors resonated through the chambers once again.

Our lanterns pierced through the darkness, but still weren’t able to reach the bottom of the pits.  After a few minutes of descending, a greasy substance started to coat the walls.  I began sweating from the heat and moisture rising from the pit below.

Slowly, every one of us falls into the pits, scanning the surrounding area. One of the coworkers shone a light on the surface directly above us.  Growths resembling oversized tongues glistened with dripping unidentifiable substances.  Looking up, the ceiling glistened a fleshy pink color. Masses of semisolid substances gathered into lukewarm, gray pearls that stuck out and hung, similarly to disco balls at nightclubs.

Then, I put everything together.  The clear sheets of rock on the surface, the strange white liquids that filled the cavities, and the pink insides.

These were giant blackheads in the ground.  What else could it have been?  The liquid was pus, the sheets were dead skin, and the pink insides were pores.  I gaze up at the hole above, hyperventilating.  If I wanted to get rid of these, I needed to find the source and destroy it from within.  Only then would the land be saved.

Off in the distance towards the north, I could make out the opening of some kind of cave.  Pockmarks of light shone through newly excavated holes.  My walkie talkie vibrated.

“You are not going to believe this, but I think these aren’t rock formations.  They’re blackheads.” I said.

“Excuse me?”  The person on the other line paused.  “Now that I think of it, it sort of makes sense.  I knew something was up with the formations and all the crusty stuff.  There’s no way in hell that this formation is just boring old rock.  Should I explore the surrounding area?” The voice on the other line replied.

“Yeah.  Go ahead.”  I responded.  “Lower down some M80’s!” I shouted to the ceiling.  While I waited for the explosives, I signaled for the groups above to lower us deeper into the chasm.  My walkie talkie vibrates again.

“We seem to be on some kind of spongy surface.  It’s more moist than a shower loofa.  What about you?”

“Hang on a second, we’re all lowering down.”  I signal for the winches above to unwind slowly.  Warm air blows on my back, coating it in a cape of stench.  The lower we descended, the more concentrated it grew.

“We should have brought gas masks; the smell is nauseating down here!  Tell me what exactly do you see?” I say.  Before I knew it, a bucket of M80’s was dropped down on another line.

“Well the surface is mostly flat and the whole area is incredibly pink.  When do you think we should use the explosives?”

“Not until we find the source of the trouble.  Anything towards the mouth of the cave?”

I could hear rhythmic squelches and plops.  “Outside from some dripping stalactites and stalagmites, nothing seems to be out of the ordinary.”

Then, my back started to tingle.  Oxygen was replaced entirely by the festering, infectious smell.  It tore at my nostrils.  I wretched, casting my head aside in case if I needed to spill my guts.

\*Hisssssssssss…\*Something was brewing deep below my feet.  Droplets of an unknown substance burst in a manner similar to popcorn, bouncing in the heat.  Looking all around the shimmering, mucous void, suspicion ate at me like wasp larvae in a caterpillar.

When the realization hit, my stomach dropped.

“STOP!” I shouted.  Everyone’s line stopped in a blink.  They chattered amongst themselves, wondering what the commotion was all about.  From the quietness of the antechamber, I could hear bubbling and churning fluids.  They were no more than a meter away.  When I pointed the light downwards, I couldn’t find a bottom to the mysterious hot spring.  The surface just shimmered a sickly bile yellow.  I turned to my other workers.  Their heads began to wobble slightly.  My vision warped and melted while my eyes grew heavier than sixteen ton weights.

“Look out below!” A worker hollered from the top of the ravines.  Everyone came to an abrupt stop.  A hammer fell from above, plummeting directly towards me.  It shined in our torches.  It landed right into the fluids with a fierce hiss.  White foam grew from the bubbling pit.  When I stuck my hand in the fluid, it corroded and burned my skin.  Acid.

I hoisted myself up before dizziness could consume me.

*Ka-thump, ka-thump, ka-thump.*  “Hang on a second, I’m picking up something.  Let me investigate.”

Was that a heartbeat?  “Wait a minute.  I don’t think those are stalactites.”	The pink spongy surface, the dead skin, the blackheads, the vat of acid, the heartbeat.  This wasn’t a cave.  The whole stinkin’ thing was an *animal*.  And we were in its stomach.

My blood froze.    I could make out someone faintly lighting something.  Looking down at the acid pit and source of the mysterious noise.

I gasp.  “DON’T LIGHT THOSE EXPLOSIVES!”

“Is something wrong, boss?” A coworker replies on the other line.

Suddenly, the cavern mouth snapped shut.  A roar bellowed throughout the entire cavern, a horrid mix between an extraterrestrial shriek and someone’s throat being slit.   I shielded my ears from the cacophony.

Off in the distance, the ground rose and sloped, plunging my men all towards the acid.  If it wasn’t for the winch lines, they all would have been dissolved into bones.  Screaming echoes as everyone frantically wound themselves up.

“WIND US BACK UP, NOW!” I ordered.  My vision goes slurry in seconds.  I could barely make out my coworkers as they rose up to the surface.  Blurry flesh lines began to surround me.  They grew larger and wider by each passing second.  Another bellow rocked my eardrums.  I struggled to snap myself out of my lethargy and gripped onto the lines, desperately pulling myself away from the gas and towards any area with oxygen.  My line hoists me far enough from the gas for me to breathe.

Just like that, my vision cleared up.  I rubbed my eyes, wondering what the mysterious shapes were.  Shining my light on one of them, stomach walls began to converge in thick curtains directly towards me.  They scooted along the bottom of the lining, rumbling.  Fluids below churn like a violent storm.  The resonating bellows ripple against the converging walls.

“KEEP WINDING!” I yelled until I swore my throat would bleed.  I looked all around me.  Everyone else had ascended up the blackhead holes in time.  I forced myself up the cords even higher, hoping I would be able to dodge the structures closing in.

Scanning around, that same rotten smell started to rise once again.  Slowly, it grew more and more noxious.  I was being wound back up, so I wondered how this could be happening.

I lowered my head; the acid was rising.

“WINCH FASTER!” I hollered above.  Throwing my jack hammer away and getting rid of the extra weight, the winch increases in speed.

Then, with a *clank*, the whole hoisting mechanism stops.  My heart skips a beat. “What are you doing?!  Pull me out!”

“The winch is stuck!”

Everywhere around me, the walls continued converging.  Four corners of the walls were at least 30 meters away and gaining.  Their glistening sides made me hyperventilate in fear.

“Don’t just stand there!  Pull me out!”  I scanned all around, hoisting myself up even further.  Before I knew it, the flesh walls were only 20 meters away.  Up above the whole, everyone on the surface began to pull.  I grip on to the line, holding for dear life.  I let go only for a moment to throw a few M80s.  They blossom into an orange explosion in seconds, stopping the walls and making the beast howl in rage.

With that small window of opportunity, the rest of the workers yanked me out.  In an instant, we all hightailed it out of the area, away from the pissed off behemoth.

\---

When word got out that thing existed, everyone quickly abandoned our town, migrating elsewhere.  My construction company nearly vanished along with the rest of the town.  Thankfully, my loyal workers were able to stick along with me thanks to a lovely invention called a bank loan.  Eventually, I settled down in a nice urban city where I am writing this now.

In retrospect, rural living isn’t such a good idea.  With all that open space, no one can ever know what’s underneath the soil.  That is, until they see the blackheads.  And that beast was only in hibernation.

I can only imagine what would happen if it was [active.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreLegion/)
