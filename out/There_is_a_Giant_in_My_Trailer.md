I’m going to be specific about this. First off, no I am not on drugs. I’ve been clean cut for the past five years or so and I’m never going back. Second, I have no history of schizophrenia. Not in me and not in my family. I’ve even checked with a shrink, and I came out green. Third I’m not exaggerating anything. There's a giant, naked, human being in my trailer. Cramped up like a caterpillar in it’s cocoon, and yes, it’s a dude and it’s junk is touching my fucking mini fridge.

I’ve had this trailer for the most part of my adult life. I’m never much for stereotypes but I am one in a way. Poor family, high school drop-out, drug addiction, and homelessness, then trailer life. It’s still progress though, a reward for the countless odd jobs I did and the days I had without any hits of ecstasy. Something that’s given me hope for the future. This mobile home might be a sign of dirty poverty but for someone that’s gone lower than that, I’d say it’s a beauty. Which made things sour when he came over.

The first time it appeared was two weeks ago. It was a couple minutes past midnight, and I was on my couch doomscrolling, when I heard this deep moaning sound. It was very guttural like a war cry. Probably some pregnant racoon giving birth, I thought, didn’t want to handle one of those again. I decided to investigate, turning on the lights and grabbing the nearest baseball bat I had I crept towards the source. One foot over the other, slightly crouched, and holding my breath.

 You never want to spook a laboring racoon unless you’re a masochist. Slowly but surely, I made my way towards the noise, every step I took made the moans louder and more aggressive. I went through the kitchen, then my bedroom, and finally in front of my bathroom door, where the sound was the loudest. Taking a deep breath, I reached the doorknob and twisted it in a quick manner, then I got in with my bat held high and my spirits even higher, ready to face any racoon related obscenities.

There were no racoons, just the vibrating hum of my closed bathroom cabinet. The sound was now blaring out, stronger than ever. Slight hesitation made it’s way to my brain, but it was only slight hesitation. Opening the cabinet, I found wrinkled softness. My wall was turned into a tan wrinkled mess, a thin line splitting it into two parts. Then it opened, revealing a single blue pupil. The sound immediately stopped, no foreplay or nothing, complete silence flooded the room.

I tried ignoring it. I thought I was a goner, some subconscious break in my psyche. I visited the shrink and like I said I got off ok, even after mentioning the giant eyeball in my bathroom. I came back and another eye managed to make it’s way into my oven. Then the day after that I found a giant mouth where my sink used to be. It opened it’s gigantic lips and used it’s tongue to shovel me into it’s mouth but it’s a good thing there were knives around. This was the moment when I decided to call the cops.

 After numerous calls they decided to send one. A no nonsense type with a handlebar moustache and a sharp crew cut. You don’t need to know his name because he got eaten by the sink mouth. Blood got everywhere and the screams got so loud. I thought the whole trailer park heard but no one came around. Speaking of no one, not a single cop showed up after this guy. I called a couple more times and a couple more deaths later I decided to stop. 

Yesterday I found a giant ear in one of my kitchen cabinets and a giant schlong in my closet. I camped out after that. I posted a couple of videos of this online and there were no views. Today was when it got worse. I opened my front door only to be greeted by the same giant eye in the bathroom cabinet, only this time it was a pair of eyes. I circled around the trailer, and I found its position. The giant was lying on it’s side with it’s knees touching it’s chest and it’s butt facing the bathroom door.

I’m going to set up camp under a bridge tonight, far, far away from this monster. Not before I turn him into barbeque. Wish me luck.
