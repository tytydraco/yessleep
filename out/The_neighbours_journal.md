My friend’s neighbour loved long walks, especially at night. He always talked about there being a sense of calm and peace under the night sky. He used to write in a journal about the things he’d seen, wildlife, flowers, how the stars formed an image in the sky. 

But this one particular night, was not calm or peaceful, and his journal describes how walking alone can change a person, forever. 

Late one evening in February 2022, David decided to take a shortcut through the woods on his way home. He’d walked this path a hundred times before, but described in his journal that tonight the air felt different, and he couldn’t shake the sensation that he was being watched. He described the wind howling through the trees, and an unnerving silence following after each gust.

As he walked deeper into the woods, the sound of his footsteps seemed louder, almost as though they were echoing back at him. He paused for a moment, looking around, but all he saw were shadows and the faint outlines of twisted branches reaching out like skeletal hands. The path ahead was barely visible, and a thick fog started to roll in from the depths of the forest.

Suddenly, he describes hearing something— a soft, almost imperceptible whisper. At first, he thought it was the wind, but then it came again, this time clearer. “David…”

He froze. He described his heart racing as the whisper seemed to come from all directions, getting closer. He called out “Who’s there?”, his voice trembling.

The whisper stopped. Then, just as he started to turn back, something caught his eye—a figure standing motionless among the trees. It was a woman, her pale face hidden by long, dark hair. Her clothes were tattered, and she stood unnaturally still, her head tilted at an impossible angle.

David took a step back, his breath coming in shallow gasps. “Are you… okay?” he asked, his voice faltering.

The figure didn’t respond. Instead, she began to move—slowly at first, dragging one foot behind her. Her body jerked unnaturally, like a puppet on strings. Then, with a sudden lurch, she broke into a full sprint, charging towards him with terrifying speed.

David said he turned and ran, stumbling over uneven ground, his lungs burning. The whisper returned, louder now, filling his ears: “David… you can’t escape me.”

Panicking, he glanced back, but she was right behind him, her gaunt face twisted into a grotesque grin. He could feel her cold breath on his neck. Desperately, he pushed himself harder, his legs aching, but the woods seemed endless, the path stretching further, the trees closing in.

Finally, with a burst of energy, David broke into a clearing. He described the fog being thick, and the moonlight barely pierced through. As he collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath, he looked up—only to see the woman standing there, watching him. But this time, she wasn’t alone.

The forest was full of them. Faces twisted in agony, their eyes hollow, their mouths open in silent screams. Figures began to emerge from the trees, each one worse than the last. They circled him, their whispers rising into a deafening chorus. “You’re ours now,” they chanted in unison.

…

We reported David missing that evening as he didn’t return home and hadn’t made any contact which was unusual for him. However, an hour after we reported his disappearance, he arrived home.

His eyes were bulging, his pupils nearly covering all the colour of his eyes. Pale, cold, and his clothes were torn. 

Me and my friend stood there in shock. “David?? What the hell happened? Where have you been?” my friend said, fear striking through her voice. 

David answered “I just need to sleep”. He went straight upstairs to the spare bedroom and locked the door. We had no idea what to do. He was a wreck. I said I’d stay the night with my friend who was visibly shaken and upset at seeing her partner in such distress. In the 10 years I’ve known her, I’ve never seen her so upset and worried, and David. It scared the hell out of me. 

The next morning I woke up early, my friend was still sleeping and I let her sleep. Last night was traumatic and she needed to rest. 

I went to check on David.

As I knocked on the spare room door, I listened for any signs of movement but there was no answer. Maybe he’s still sleeping? I called his name but again, no answer. That’s when I decided to open the door and see if he was okay.

The bed was made, and had not been slept in. His journal was laid out, open on the bed with something written on one of the pages. “I am one of them now. My time is up. Read my journal. Do not look for me”. 

What the hell is going on??

I woke Kirsty up and told her David left a note and had gone. We called the police, explained what had happened when he returned home last night and they went out searching for David. 

…

It’s been three years. The police haven’t found David, we have had no contact, nobody knows where he is. He has simply, disappeared and all that is left is his journal and his explanation of what happened to him that night. 

David, if you’re out there, please, come home.
