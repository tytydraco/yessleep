Exactly the title. I'm being stalked and I don't know what to do. They are going to get me. It started about a year ago. I would notice these 3 men every where I would go. No matter where I went, no matter what I was doing I'd always see them at some point or another. They were never together, but always the same 3.

Now as you can probably guess I have gone to the police, I have told everyone I know, and I have taken some pretty extensive measures to make sure I'm safe. From multiple locks on my doors and windows, to only traveling by a friend. Who, thank goodness, is doing their best to help keep me sane. You see she has never seen them. It's as if everytime I look away they disappear. But she believe me non the less.

Over the year the distance between them and I has been getting shorter. At first they were far away enough that I could only make out the colors of their clothes, if at all. They always have on the same clothes. Now I can clearly see their clothes. The first wears a flannel shirt, blue jeans, and work boots. The second wears a button down shirt, slacks, and dress shoes, and the last wears a dirty wife beater, and jeans that look as if they are about to fall apart, no shoes just socks covered in holes. 

I can't understand it. Maybe it's because they have been following me so long but they seem familiar in a weird way. Like something in the back of my mind is telling me I know them, but I can't place it since I hadn't seen their faces. That was until a couple days ago. 

I was out with a friend to do some basic shopping, and gather stuff for a project I was doing at work. It was going pretty great until the well known, feeling of dread crept over me. I started to glance around to see where, and which one it was. There was no sign of them. I sighed thi king I had let the paranoia get to me. That was until I turned around. There stood the man in the dirty wife beater. 

He was a heavy set man, that looked like he hadn't bathed in years. His head was dented in on the left side where he had been struck by something. Blood slowly oozed from the wound, and i could make out what looked to be his brains. The fear that ran through me was almost paralyzing. I grabbed my friends arm, and ran out of the store. As we ran to the car she kept asking me what was wrong, or if I saw someone but the fear kept me running. 

As we made it to the car I told her what I saw. She had a look of sadness and sympathy. I turned to look out the window, and thats when I saw the man with the flannel shirt. He too, looked just as horrid as the other man. That lead me to assume the man with the dress shirt, would look the same. And I knew then why there was a sense of knowing them. I have seen them before. I screamed out for her to drive. She threw the car into drive, and we left. She had a very worried look on her face. She wanted to speak, but was hesitant. 

"Spit it out already" I told her. 
"Are you sure someone was there?" She asked as gently as she could. 
"Of course there was!! Why do you think I would make this up?!?" I yeld at her. How dare she accuse me of that. 
"Tracy, I looked... there was no one there." She said once again being as gentle as she could. 
"You don't understand. They shouldn't be here!!" I screamed out, tears flooding my eyes, and face. 
"What do you mean honey." She said with a confused look as she glanced between me and the road.
"This shouldn't be possible, they can't be following me." I cried.
"Please tell me what is going on Tracy, I want to help." She had tears and worry in her eyes. 
"They can't be following me because I killed them. I killed all 3 of them almost 2 years ago."  I was now choking on my sobs, and Candice's mouth hung open. She pulled the car over quickly, and jumped out. 

Why did I have to tell her that? Why did I have to ruin something so nice? Candice was my only friend. So I did what anyone in this situation would do. It's been 2 days and I haven't left my house. No matter what i do, they are at every window, and door. They are just waiting. Waiting for me to leave. Lightly knocking every few minutes. I'll look out my peephole every now and then, to be met with their dead eye stares. I dont think I'll make it much longer. I'm eventually going to have to face them.... especially now that Candice has joined in the knocking.
