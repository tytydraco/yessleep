It was close to noon when John and I rolled up to this desolate old house on the outskirts of town. A two-story building that looked like it’d been abandoned for years. Broken windows, a spotty paintjob, and a messy yard. Empty planters lined the walkway to the front door, and a smashed greenhouse peeked out of the back yard. A dry miscolored sunflower rested in one of the windows, and a pile of spray cans were piled up in the middle of the yard.

“So are we picking him up here, or…”

“No,” sighed John. “This is it.”

“You can’t be serious.”

“It’s not as bad as it looks.”

“Good, because it *looks* like you want to give me a sort of... mold respiratory infection.”

&#x200B;

John opened the glove box and handed me an old phone; the kind with buttons on it and a screen where you could count the pixels.

“If it all goes sideways, there is one number on that,” he said. “But try to get along. Evan can protect you better than I can.”

“What about the, uh blood work?” I asked. “We just gonna ignore that?”

“I’ll come by in a couple of weeks. You’ll be fine.”

I knew better than to argue. John always knew more than he let on, and if this was our best solution then so be it. I didn’t have to like it though.

“Just give him some space,” said John. “Don’t push him too hard, and you’ll be fine.”

“What’s… what’s his deal? What do I do?”

“Just introduce yourself and be respectful. You’ll be fine. And once you stop seeing headless corpses, we can discuss getting you back to the ranch.”

&#x200B;

There was no point in telling him no. Instead I just walked up to the front of the house. I watched John roll away, leaving me with a lot of questions and an old phone.

The front door was slightly mossy, and had chipped white paint. It was already about an inch open, but I decided to stick to John’s advice. I could be respectful and at least give it a proper knock.

I knocked twice, and something electronic crackled to life. A little red light turned on, revealing a cleverly hidden camera in the door frame.

“Hi, I’m looking for, uh… Evan?” I said. “I’m with John. Digman.”

“Please fill out. The questionnaire.”

It was a mechanical voice; probably generated from a text-to-speech program.

“What questionnaire?”

“Please fill out. The questionnaire.”

&#x200B;

I took a step back and picked up my phone. Not the old busted one I got from John, but my own. I hadn’t used it for some time, and I rarely got anything on it, but it was still with me. I had a new message with a link to an online form. How the hell it got through my spam filter was a miracle. How it found me was another.

I filled it out. Took me about 20 minutes in total. A lot of questions about my personal health and hygiene, but also a list of employers and acquaintances. It felt official, like someone had put a lot of thought into it. Maybe even government level.

“There,” I said. “You need time to read it?”

“Checklist process level green.”

“I’m sorry, what?”

“Please enter the kitchen. Sit down.”

The door clicked, and what sounded like a series of steel bolts clunked to the side. John was right, this place was more than it appeared.

&#x200B;

I entered a thin hallway. It was too small for two people to walk shoulder-to-shoulder, and it really felt like a rickety old building. But I was starting to get the impression that it was mostly just for show. The door had a solid steel core, with two-inch thick bolts locked into a solid frame. The floor didn’t buckle under my weight. No creaking doors.

I stepped into a small kitchen with a round table and two chairs. There was a plate and a coffee cup put out, but it looked a bit too… staged. Like everything had been propped up to appear like someone had either recently lived here or abandoned the place. For example, one of the kitchen drawers had been opened just enough so you could see it was empty, but the drawer itself couldn’t be moved; it was screwed tight. It was meant to look open.

One of the chairs was nailed to the floor, but I could sit down by the other. I could hear a small series of light taps coming from the cellar, stopping just outside the kitchen door. I looked over, but couldn’t see anyone. They were hiding just out of sight.

&#x200B;

“He… hell…”

A hesitant and quiet voice, followed by a violent cough.

“Hell-o. Hello. Hell…oe?”

He was testing the word. Tasting it. Adjusting his voice. It was vaguely masculine, but there was really no way to say for sure. Might be young, might be old. Could be anyone, really.

“Hello,” I said. “Did John tell you about me?”

“Irr… irrelev-ant. Irrelevant. Yes. Hello.”

“I’m sorry, what did you-“

&#x200B;

There was a short pause as someone took a deep breath.

“That which was formerly divulged is extraneous,” he said. “What is to come is the single element of consequence.”

It was as if something clicked. Like a computer successfully rebooting, or someone waking up from a long nap. The person outside suddenly spoke with perfect clarity and a very *human* voice. It was hard to pinpoint the issue of it. How can a voice sound so perfectly *human*? *Too* human?

“John said I might be able to stay here for a while,” I said. “Until things clear up. That you could-“

“Arrange an appropriate safeguard, yes,” he said. “I am well-informed.”

“So what do you want me to do?”

“Walk upstairs. Stay upstairs. All rooms are vacant.”

“That’s it?”

“Affirmative.”

&#x200B;

I got up from my chair, and there was a sudden rush of thuds; like someone scrambling to their feet.

“No! Not now! Wait!” he said. “Wait until… until gone!”

His voice changed. It turned younger and shrill. I just stopped as I heard him hurry downstairs. There was something strange about his walk. There was an uneven amount of footsteps.

I walked upstairs. There were four rooms, all pretty small. A bedroom, a bathroom, a study with an old Windows 98 computer, and a little guest room. There was an old box-like TV with a built-in VHS player and a small bookshelf full of tapes. All the classics, mostly Disney.

As soon as I stepped into the bedroom, an electronic spark came to life. There was a speaker in every room. Probably a ton of cameras as well.

“Call out to me if you are in distress.”

It was a different voice; a young woman. Almost sultry.

“I’m sorry, who’s this? You sound-“

“Yes, of course,” the voice said. “Pardon.”

&#x200B;

There was a short pause, then the voice returned. This time with the same tone it’d used in the kitchen.

“My name is Evan. I live here. I do not like meeting new people.”

“Thanks for having me, Evan. Let me know if there’s anything I can do.”

“Anything… you can do?”

“Yes, well… to help out. Around the house,” I said. “Just staying here feels a bit… moochy?”

“Will you provide me with samples?”

“Excuse me?”

“Do I have permission to collect samples?”

“What do you mean ‘samples’? Will it hurt?”

“It will not hurt.”

“Then, uh… sure. Least I can do.”

There was a short squealing sound, which was cut off as a finger was lifted off the broadcast button. Seconds later, Evan came back. This time with a slightly older, more composed voice.

“This pleases me.”

&#x200B;

That was my first day staying with Evan. It was surprisingly comfortable, even if Evan freaked me out at times. The house was just meant to look old from the outside, but the furniture was sturdy and brand new. Hell, the old box-TV could play blu-rays. The computer had some sort of homemade OS on it, something Linux-based. Had its’ own logo and everything; a cockroach splayed out like Da Vinci’s ‘Vitruvian Man’.

Evan brought me three meals a day. Perfectly balanced nutrition; fruits, vegetables, pasta, grains, and fish. A lot of fish. Sometimes chicken.

I took long showers and sometimes a bath. There was plenty of soaps and creams to try out. I felt like a walking rainforest most of the time. I watched old movies, surfed the web, and kept watch through the window. There was nothing out there. At least no headless corpses. Also, Evan cleaned up the pile of spray cans at some point.

&#x200B;

Time passed. After about a week we’d crossed into the month of April. I could feel myself growing restless. There’d been nothing coming for me, but I was having trouble sleeping. The reality of my situation had started to dawn on me. To be a Yearwalker. What would I even wish for at the end of the year? Could it really be anything? Would ‘a million wishes’ work?

No, I should stick to what I promised my dad. I really should.

I was sitting by the old computer looking out the window as the clock crept closer to midnight. It was only then that I realized there was something strange in the driveway.

&#x200B;

It was odd that I hadn’t noticed it before. I’d looked out that window a hundred times by then, and all of a sudden there was a small rocking horse just off the side of the driveway. It was definitely out of place. There had never been a playground on Evan’s yard.

“Evan?” I said out loud. “Are you seeing this?”

“*Seeing…* *what*?”

I recoiled. The voice wasn’t coming from the speaker system, but the hallway.

&#x200B;

I completely lost my cool. Looking back outside, there was nothing. No rocking horse, just a plain driveway. But even more so, Evan was standing just outside of my room. Out of view, like always.

“Sorry,” I said. “There was something, uh… out in the yard.”

“*Was it an intruder*?”

“No, more like a… a rocking horse.”

“*Does that correlate to the threat you have been facing*?”

“No, uh… those were different. Just keep an eye out.”

“*How far out*?”

I chuckled, but Evan didn’t.

&#x200B;

Over the next few days, I started noticing other strange things around the house. At first it was a rocking horse, then a small drinking fountain, a pile of tires, an apple tree. Just… things. It was making me question myself. Maybe I was starting to see things. Maybe I’d been locked up for too long. Still, I couldn’t complain; Evan was an excellent host, if a bit creepy.

Evan didn’t seem to notice the things I pointed out. Maybe he wasn’t paying attention, or maybe he was busy with something else. He spent pretty much all his time in the basement, which I had yet to see. Then again, I hadn’t even seen Evan.

&#x200B;

It all came to a head one night as I got up to take a leak. I walked past the study, only to notice a new set of curtains. Nothing special, but they were not there earlier. I paused.

Now, they could’ve been put up by Evan. He did fiddle around the house at times. But he must’ve done so recently, as those curtains looked brand new. I had been in the study just hours before. Peeking into the bathroom, I could see some new things in there as well. A few hairbrushes, some new shampoos, and a bathmat.

“Evan?” I said out loud. “Did… you put up some new things?”

“Yes,” a voice spoke over the speakers. “There have been several improvements in the bathroom for your convenience.”

“Only the bathroom?”

“Yes. Are you lacking a particular comfort?”

“No, I was thinking about the curtains in the study,” I said. “Did you-“

“Curtains?”

&#x200B;

For a brief moment there was something bulging behind the curtain. Something vaguely humanoid, with a glowing set of blue eyes. It moved. I only had time to inhale before all hell broke lose.

There was a sound, like an excited dog slipping on a hardwood floor. Not trusting the bathroom, I hurried inside the guest room. I could feel my heart racing as I slammed the door shut. Something started scratching.

“E-Evan?” I said. “Evan, are you-“

&#x200B;

Hands, grabbing me from behind.

Something pulling me back. Looking back on it, I can’t believe I missed the painting on the wall; it hadn’t been there earlier that day.

The guest room window had been opened, and I was pulled through it.

&#x200B;

It happened so fast. I fell from the second floor, only to land on something soft and vaguely humanoid.

I got up and looked down. I’d landed on what looked like a cushion. I was standing out in the yard, and there was no one there.

There was, however, *hundreds* of things.

&#x200B;

Garbage bags, an old carpet, stacks of bottles. Crates, iron rods, a tent, parts of a broken chain-linked fence. I heard something moving behind me, but when I turned there were just more items. An old couch, a tree stump, a cardboard sign for a bank downtown. The pile of spray cans were back. Everytime I turned around, I heard things move closer, and the items kept changing.

As soon as I looked away, it was as if they changed to something else. And when I didn’t look, they got closer.

Even the cushion underneath me changed from a cushion, to a wicker basket, to a deflated ‘happy birthday’-balloon.

I just kept spinning around, trying to keep my eye on everything all at once. My breathing was so shallow that it stopped, quickly making me light-headed. But no matter how fast I was, I could feel them closing in. Bigger items, coming ever so slightly closer. I was starting to see something eerily human in them. A vase with a pair of eyes. A poster that kept looking at me. Water bottles with vaguely threatening text.

Closer.

Closer.

*Closer*.

&#x200B;

Something stabbed me.

A sharp, painful brun, just to the right of my spine. About an inch deep, no thicker than a pencil. But to have your flesh severed… I can’t explain the pain. I almost fell forward as this bright, searing warmth burned me.

As I spun around, there was a lampshade right behind me. I heard something sharp pierce the air behind me, and I turned around in time to see a part of a broken column with sharp pieces of rebar sticking out.

Waving my arm back, I felt something sharp brush against the palm of my hand. On my left side, something pierced the skin under my arm. Something poked against my right knee, but couldn’t pierce the fabric.

Then, a large hand caught my hair. I was stuck.

They got me.

&#x200B;

I flailed with my arms, trying to push them off. Another stab in my left thigh, one more just off the side of my throat. And everything inched closer. I couldn’t close my eyes. If I did, there’d be nothing stopping them.

But it was too late.

“Please-“

&#x200B;

What happened was quick.

There was this awful smattering noise, like a silenced machine gun. A burst of air that flicked loose dust into the air, covering the area in a cloud. I could barely make out what I was seeing. There were no longer items around me, just silhouettes of people with bright blue eyes.

And *something else*.

Long tendrils reaching, ripping, tearing them apart. A pair of insect-like wings spread out in an X-shape. Innumerable eyes appearing all over a morphing, gibbous mass of claw, muscle, and spikes. And that awful chemical smell; the same I’d felt that first night of my Yearwalk.

The creatures were scrambling to get away, but they didn’t all make it. Some were torn to pieces, others were devoured. Bones snapped to the rhythm of death-squeals.

Finally, something let go of my hair, leaving only a severed hand behind.

&#x200B;

I curled up on the driveway. I covered my head and tried to drown out the screams.

So many screams.

Suddenly, it was all quiet.

All except for a heavy breathing. Half a dozen mouths panting for air, all at once.

&#x200B;

“*d o n o t l o o k,*” it said, voices speaking in unison. “*d o n o t l o o k a t m e.*”

I didn’t. I stayed down, shielding myself. I could feel my clothes soaking with blood, and not all of it was my own.

“*Can… can you walk*?” Evan asked, finding his voice again.

“Y-yeah,” I wheezed. “I-I’m bleeding.”

“*I know*.”

I looked up, only to see a perfectly normal person. An average adult male with short brown hair, black clothes, and brown eyes. Just like his voice, it was just slightly *too* human.

Then, he twitched.

It was just for a second, but I could see his clothes moving. I realized he’d wrapped himself in sort of a sort of hairy membrane. These weren’t clothes. That wasn’t even a head. It was all just… mimicry.

“*Don’t look*!” he roared, without opening his mouth.

I closed my eyes as he carried me back inside.

&#x200B;

He helped me get back to bed. I promised to keep my eyes closed, and he sat down to help bandage my wounds. I needed stitches.

“What… what was that?” I asked.

“Purebloods,” he answered. “Difficult things.”

“I’ve never seen anything like it.”

“Yes you have,” he added. “You have seen them, but not noticed them.”

&#x200B;

While he stitched up the wound on my back, I tried to fill the silence.

“You know what they are?”

“Yes,” Evan said. “We are similar.”

“You’re like them?”

“Half.”

He put medical tape over the wound and started working on the spot under my arm.

&#x200B;

“Evan, do you… do you know why they’re attacking me?” I asked.

“Yes.”

“But you’re not attacking.”

“I considered it.”

He didn’t miss a beat. I almost swallowed my heart, but he didn’t seem the least bit bothered.

“I’m glad you didn’t.”

“Yes.”

&#x200B;

Evan finished my stitches and walked out of the room. He was quick on his feet. Then again, he seemed to have more than two feet. As he got out of the room, I hurried to ask.

“Evan, why are you helping me? What are you getting out of this?”

There was a short pause as he considered his response. There were a few insect-like clicks as something tapped against the wall.

“I had a strange dad too.”
