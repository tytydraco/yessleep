Several years ago after a bad breakup, I decided to take a trip to Hawaii. 

While asking the locals about places I should see, I was informed about the Haiku Stairs (which was illegal to climb) and knew I needed to climb them.

 Located on the island of Oahu in the Ko'olau Mountain Range it had over 3000 steps. Built in 1942 during World War 2 by the U.S. Navy, it was part of a radio station that transmitted signals to the nearby naval ships.

Anyway, where was I? Oh, as I stated before once I made up my mind, I decided to hike the Haiku Stairs despite it being illegal. I was always the type of person who was up for a challenge.

It was maybe my fourth day in Hawaii when I was dropped off near the stairs. The day was relatively cool with the occasional rain but I wasn't going to let that deter me from my big adventure (which I would later regret).

I did some mild stretches before beginning my descent up the Haiku Stairs. Although climbing the stairs was illegal, I noticed several other people there besides me.

At first, my hike up the stairs was slow but eventually, I picked up momentum, and at around noon I finally reached the top. It was beautiful up there but the wind was ferocious nearly pushing me over the stairs. 

Of course, I took pictures but despite the lovely view I had to get back to civilization.

My climb down wasn't easy, though. My feet were sore, my legs hurt like crazy and I was exhausted.

Anyway, it was very late when I finally reached the bottom. I decided to camp out near the stairs for the night. Luckily, I brought my tent and camping gear and found a secluded area to camp.

After setting my tent up, I realized I was hungry so I prepped one of those meal pouches (which was surprisingly good) but afterward, I decided to go to sleep because I was extremely exhausted from my morning hike.

Two hours later I was awoken by the sounds of someone or something whistling.

"Who's out there?" I shouted but the whistling continued, I opened the flap of my tent, and the whistling stopped. Using the flashlight on my phone I aimed it into the trees and spotted a very tall shadow figure standing there.

"Hello?" I nervously said and that's when the laughter started which sounded hollow.

"Who's there?" I asked.

"Who's there?" it repeated in a voice that sounded much like mine.

I stood there for what seemed like an eternity unable to move but eventually, I regained my courage.

"If you don't leave, I'm calling the cops!"

"If you don't leave, I'm calling the cops!" it repeated mockingly.

That's when I decided to run, leaving all my gear behind.

I could hear it behind me, and its mocking tone caused me to run even faster and by 2 AM, I was finally out of the woods.

Looking back, I noticed the creature was now gone.

Eventually, I chalked up my experience to exhaustion that was until a couple of years ago while looking through my phone, I found some long-forgotten pictures from my hike and was shocked to find the tall shadow figure in every picture.

Whether you believe me or not, I'm here to tell you that there's a darker reason why it's forbidden for you to climb the Haiku Stairs. So, here's my warning to you never climb the Haiku Stairs ever...
