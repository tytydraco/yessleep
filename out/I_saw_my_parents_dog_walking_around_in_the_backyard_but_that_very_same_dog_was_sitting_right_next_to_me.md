This just happened a couple hours ago. I’m still pretty shaken up and wanted to post the story here in case someone can think of a rational explanation.

A little bit of background: I left my childhood home a couple years ago and moved out of state for work. I visit every few months, and I just arrived back in town for one of those visits today. I have a good relationship with my parents, and it’s always great to see them in person again. It’s also always great to see Judy, the little gray Schnauzer I grew up with. She’s about 17 now, but she’s still pretty spry and energetic, always racing around my parents’ little dirt backyard and barking up a storm at the slightest provocation.

Anyway, after I arrived, we ordered pizza and talked over the dinner table about my career, my dad’s retirement plans, sports, politics, all that stuff. I didn’t notice anything wrong then. Nothing seemed awry. My parents were chatting away. Judy was sitting patiently on the floor by my chair, watching me intently and wagging her tail every time I brought a slice of pizza to my mouth. Everything was fine.

Then, as we were finishing up, I heard a bark from outside. It sounded like Judy, so I instinctively glanced over at the screen door leading to the backyard, and to my utter shock, I saw a small gray dog- the spitting image of Judy- strolling across the dirt. The sun had begun to set, but I could still see the dog very clearly in the twilight, and under any other circumstances, I would have been certain it was Judy. The mystery dog had the same comically large “mustache” and much smaller “beard”, the same unusually short legs for the breed, the same long streaks of white fur- even the same asymmetrical ears, with one drooping noticeably more than the other. I saw it for probably a full ten seconds before it ambled out of view, and I was sure it was not some other Miniature Schnauzer- it was my dog, my family’s dog. It was Judy. But that was impossible, because Judy was still sitting right beside me, waiting patiently for scraps.

I looked at my parents, ready to make a baffled quip about what I’d seen, but the words died in my mouth when I saw that all the color had drained from their faces. They were so pale that, for a split second, I almost thought they were both having some sort of medical crisis- that’s where my mind automatically went, anyway.

I ended up stammering something to the effect of “Uh… did you guys see that?” My dad leaned forward very stiffly and explained to me in a hushed, grave tone that this had been happening for months. They had been seeing and hearing this doppelgänger dog in their backyard since a few weeks after my last visit. They had been staying inside at night and had even, they said, gone so far as to buy Judy a litter box so they didn’t have to let her out at night before they went to bed (although I’m not sure how adept she is at using it).

Sometimes it came several nights a week. Sometimes it stayed away so long that they were nearly able to put it out of their minds. Occasionally, it would scratch at the door and whine to be let in, and my parents would lock themselves in another room and hold Judy- the real Judy- tightly until the sounds stopped. Whenever they had managed to muster the courage to step outside and look for it, it was nowhere to be found- and the backyard of that house is not large. It doesn’t have any places for a dog to hide, nor is there any way a small dog could get into or out of it, at least not that I or my parents can think of.

The story certainly sent a chill down my spine, but I couldn’t quite figure out why my parents were apparently living in so much fear of a tiny dog. Sure, it looked a lot like Judy, and the resemblance had spooked me too when I saw it, but were they absolutely sure it wasn’t some other Mini-Schnauzer that somehow kept managing to break into their yard? Maybe I was just trying to rationalize the situation away (because deep down, I knew what I had seen), but wasn’t it possible it was owned by one of their neighbors? Why didn’t they dash outside as soon as they saw it and try to catch it?

My dad looked at me, and I could tell he was struggling hard with whether or not he should speak his mind. After a moment, he did, and I remember the exact words he said:

“Something about it just isn’t right,” he said. “It’s not a dog. Sometimes, when it looks at you… it smiles, and not like a dog would.”

Before I could fully digest that statement or ask for more details, I heard another bark. This time, it sounded like it was coming from the front yard. I glanced down at Judy. She didn’t appear to have registered the noise- but she’s gone a bit deaf in her old age, so that wasn’t surprising.

My parents and I definitely registered it, though, and I decided to seize the opportunity to go investigate. As I stood and walked to the front door, my parents begged me not to go outside. They said they thought it was dangerous, whatever it was, and they said they’d never heard it from the front yard before. The fear in their voices nearly stopped me, but I carried on, determined to get to the bottom of things. They were being absurd, I told myself. Surely this was indeed just some other dog who happened to look similar to Judy, not… whatever evil entity they had apparently scared themselves into believing it was. So I told them I would be right back and not to worry, and then I opened the door and slipped out into the night, trying to ignore my own trepidation.

The warm summer air felt heavy around me. I remember thinking it was like I was suddenly walking with a blanket draped over my whole body. I gently closed the door behind myself and walked down the driveway. A faint orange glow, an echo of sunset, still lingered in the sky, giving me a reasonable amount of light as I slowly moved toward the street. I didn’t see anything strange or hear any more barking as I scanned the area. I didn’t hear much of anything, in fact- it was very quiet out there, and the air was totally still. I came to a stop in the middle of the road, and after a few moments standing there among the growing darkness, I admit that I began to feel very, very creeped out. I walked up and down the street a few times, looking for a flash of gray and straining to hear that familiar bark, but after finding nothing, I headed back to the house.

The door was locked, which I initially chalked up to more paranoia on my parents’ part. I knocked, and after a few moments, the door swung open.

If I’d thought my parents were terrified before, that was nothing compared to the expressions of absolute horror on their faces now. It was as though I’d reappeared on their doorstep a day after they’d watched me die in front of them.

“What the hell are you doing back out there?” my mom hissed through clenched teeth. I was completely bemused and asked what she meant, the implications of the question’s wording not yet dawning on me.

My dad peered apprehensively into the darkness behind me, and my mom started asking me questions about my childhood- what I’d gotten from Santa alongside my rocking horse when I was five years old, what school I’d gone to in seventh grade, what my best friend’s name was in high school. I answered them all, growing increasingly alarmed and confused, and then finally she grabbed my arm and pulled me inside. My dad slammed the door shut behind me and locked it, and they told me what had happened:

According to them, I had already come back inside about two minutes ago. They said I had been acting a little odd- somewhat sullen and not very talkative- and had headed upstairs to my old room to “make a call”. They’d assumed I had gotten scared, maybe seen something I didn’t want to talk about, and needed some time to myself. But now, two minutes later, here I was again.

We all just stared at each other for a moment, and I could feel the panic growing between the three of us. Then my mom said she wanted to call the police, and my dad said he’d get his gun. I made some lame remark about how he’d better not shoot me. He quipped, “Depends which you is really you.” But his gun was upstairs and we’d have to pass my room to get to it anyway, so we decided to just go up there together and face whatever might be waiting for us in my room. We grabbed some knives from the kitchen, along with a fireplace poker, and up we went.

By that point, I half-expected to see an exact duplicate of myself staring at me when we rounded the corner into my room, but there was no one there. I immediately noticed and pointed out that the window was slightly ajar. I was sure I hadn’t opened it when I’d gone up there earlier to drop off my luggage, and my parents were adamant that they hadn’t touched it either. I firmly latched it and drew the curtains over it, and then we searched all the rooms upstairs, checking under beds and inside closets, leaving no stone unturned. There were no signs of an intruder- other than that slightly open window, which none of us could shake off. At one point, my dad started to ask me a question that I think would’ve gone something like “You didn’t climb out the window and go back to the front door, did you?”, but he clearly thought better of it and stopped. I don’t blame him for wanting to ask, but I know I didn’t do that- and I know they know I didn’t do that.

When we were done, we headed back downstairs and sat on the couch, all of us deep in thought. A minute or so later, we heard barking coming from the backyard again. My dad covered his eyes for a moment, obviously exhausted by the whole ordeal, and I think that’s when I decided that I HAD to get to the bottom of this for his and my mom’s sake.

And while we were sitting there, Judy, whose absence I hadn’t even noticed during our search of the house, darted out from under the dinner table. Her stronger ear stood at attention as she cocked her head and wagged her tail, gazing at us with evident curiosity. My parents’ stories and my dad’s stupid line about the impostor dog not being “right” must have been getting to me, because at that moment, I could have almost sworn she was smiling.

So that’s what happened. My parents have gone to bed, although I doubt they’re asleep. I haven’t heard any more barking, but it’s only been a couple hours. I’m sitting here on my bed with the lights on, looking for answers online and trying to stop thinking about that window, which is currently about five feet away from me. Do you guys have any idea what could be causing this? I did already tell my parents to buy a carbon monoxide detector and have the house inspected, but I’m not sure carbon monoxide could cause collective hallucinations like this. I don’t really believe in the supernatural, so I want to exhaust all other possibilities before I conclude it must be that. But either way, I don’t want my parents to keep living under siege from some unknown terror, and I certainly don’t want things to escalate even further than they did today. Any help would be much appreciated.
