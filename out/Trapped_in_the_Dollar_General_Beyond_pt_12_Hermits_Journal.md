Well, the rain is still coming down, and I'm sitting here watching it fall.

It's been a day since my last post, and I've been stuck here thanks to the burning rain. I've been enjoying your comments (sparingly, of course, since I don't want to kill my phone), but this morning I found something to occupy my time besides watching raindrops. I had completely forgotten about the other journal until today, but I found it again when I was looking for supplies in my bag. Somewhere between a bag of crushed chips and a honey bun, I found the smaller journal that I had found in the bag with Celene's journal. It was little more than a battered notebook and it looked like it had been through hell. I still had Celene's journal in the front pocket, I was still hoping to show it to Gale, but I had almost forgotten about this one.

I didn't have much else to do, so I cracked it open and started reading.

When I was done, I felt that the info was worth a little battery power to share.

The journal is from Jasper, another victim/traveler through the Dollar General Beyond.

Jasper, unlike the rest of us, wasn't looking for a way out.

Jasper was looking for someone, someone I had read about before.

Jasper was looking for his grandson, Jacob.

January 10th, 1991

That date is just a guess, but it's the best guess I have.

Jacob and I have been stuck inside this Dollar General Beyond for the last four days.

It all began because I had to use the bathroom. Jacob didn't want to come with me, he was a big boy and too old to go to the bathroom with his pawpaw, but five years old isn't really a safe age to just leave him outside while I do my business. So, we stepped in and, to our surprise, stepped back out into another Dollar General. I thought I might be having a senior moment for a second, but when we turned around and walked back through the door, we were in a Dollar General again instead of a bathroom. We found the doors locked and couldn't get anyone to help us get out, so we made ourselves comfortable until they opened the next day. None of the food packages were in a language I could read, but the food eats okay, and we didn't imagine we would be there longer than a night.

After four days, I have to believe we have slipped into some kind of Twilight Zone place.

Jacob thought it was funny when I told him we were stuck here, but I've started noticing that the food doesn't replenish itself. Jacob is building models and coloring, but the more I observe, the more I'm worried that we might starve here. I keep hoping we will wake up and find that everything is back to normal, but the longer it goes on, the less hope I have that will happen.

The story was a familiar one, at first. Jasper tested the place they were, looking for a way out, and Jacob kept busy with toys and things. The two were fine, at first, but I could definitely sympathize with Jasper when he talked about the food eventually running out. When I didn't know how the place worked, I had obsessed over how much food I would have before I ran out, and I knew how that weighed on a person. They stayed in the DGB for about a week and a half before the entries changed, and it all seemed to kick off with the disappearance of Jacob.

January 20th

Jacob is gone!

I woke up and he is nowhere to be found!

I have looked everywhere, in every conceivable place, but I can't find him.

I'm frantic, looking under every shelf and behind every box, but my grandson is just gone.

I don't understand where he went, or how he would have left. The doors never open, and no one ever comes or goes, but I do seem to recall something from the night before the longer I look for him. It was something almost out of a dream, something half-remembered, but I think it might be an actual memory. If it is, then I know what I have to do, but I don't really understand how to go about it.

Jacob woke me up saying he needed to go to the bathroom and I rolled over without thinking about it.

Is it possible that he went through the bathroom door and crossed somewhere else like we did to get here?

It looks like I'll have to find out.

I looked up as a loud rumble sent flashes through the sky outside. It had been raining for a little while, but this was the first time I had seen lighting. I didn't know if it signified anything, but it didn't seem to be affecting the rain at all so I went back to reading. I threw a little more kindling on the fire, the red stalks burning nicely, and went back to the journal.

It appeared that Jasper had begun traveling as he searched for his Grandson.

January 21st

Still no sign of Jacob.

I've been to three different stores, and I can't find him.

I did notice that in the store I came to some items were missing that he likes to eat, so maybe he moved on after eating a little. He's only four. I don't know what he's thinking. Maybe he panicked after going through it and didn't understand or something. I don't know, but I wish he would stop. I'm so worried about him, and it's not good for my condition. I'm kind of hoping to find one of these stores with a pharmacy in it, because, as it stands, I have enough pills to last me a few weeks, but that's it.

I have to figure something out in the meantime. This journal helps, but it's the only thing I have sometimes that tethers me to the present. I need my meds and I need Jacob, or I might have bigger problems than being stuck.

Pills? I wondered what pills he was talking about, but I also wondered how he kept his journal on him while traveling? Did he have some sort of innate ability? Maybe, as I guessed from the talk of pills, he had some kind of altered mental state that made his traveling possible. Either way, it was interesting to read about it from other people's point of view. I had enjoyed hearing Celene talk about her journey and hearing from the crazy old man now kind of made it even cooler.

January 24th (I think)

I've been traveling nonstop, trying to catch up to Jacob. I don't know how this works, but I haven't seen any sign of him in a while. The last time I went, I just collapsed in a store, and thank goodness it was a safe one. I went to one yesterday that was a cave and I found a creature living in it that almost got me. Thankfully it isn't very quick, or I'd be one dead old man.

I know that Jacob is out there, however. I will find him, hopefully, before it's too late.

He wrote a lot, and I realized that he traveled farther than Celene or I had. He talked about familiar stores, and stores I had never even dreamed of. He saw a Dollar General that was in a forest, the animals there wearing little vests and stocking shelves with products brought in by birds. He talked about a store where the products tried to bite you and seemed hostile. He talked about encountering Miasmas of his own, and how terrified he was that Jacob might have run afoul of them, and all the while I began to fear for his mental state. His writing got less and less coherent as he went, and I wondered what was going on with him?

Then I turned the page and a label fell out that solved one particular mystery. He had abandoned the dates by this point, but I could understand that. It was hard to tell dates and days when you were traveling, but he had laid the label in here like a book mark. Maybe he was afraid of losing it, maybe he just wanted to save this page. I didnâ€™t know, but what followed was enlightening.

I ran out of meds today. It doesn't seem to matter, they weren't helping. I need to find Jack, but I can't find any sign of him at all. Was it Jack I was looking for? I think so. He's just a little guy, he's going into third grade. I need to find him before his Cubscout meeting starts?

I don't know where I am, but it seems like I've been here long enough that it's hard to remember where I'm going or where I've been.

The journal helps sometimes. Reading it now it seems I'm looking for Jacob, not Jack.

Jack is my son. Jack is grown up, not a little kid. Jacob is Jacks's son, my grandson, and he's lost.

I'll sleep now, but I need to find him soon.

I picked up the label that had fluttered out and it turned out to be from a pill bottle. Donepezil was not a name I was familiar with, but the instructions were for the "Treatment of dementia symptoms. That explained a lot. If the hermit had been suffering from dementia then maybe his state had deteriorated over time and he had become feral. Traveling couldn't cure him, but it could help prevent the dementia from killing him. There was still so much about this place I didn't understand, but the longer I stayed here, the more I felt I had a handle on.

I kept reading, but it got bleaker the longer I went on.

Today I found a store where it snowed inside. There were snowmen wearing vests. They tried to get me, but I ran. No sign of Jackob.

Today I saw a store full of water, but I could breathe the water. It was fun, but still no Jacob.

Found a store made of candy. Jack would have liked it. Where did he go? I could have sworn he was with me when I got here.

The book was full of little passages like that. Just quick asides about where he was going and what was there. I made some notes in my own journal, jotting down stores to look out for in the future...if I ever get back inside. I think I will, but it's just a feeling. I didn't think I could get out until a few days ago, but here I am, in the Outside. I kept turning pages and reading passages, but it wasn't until I saw something about going back that I stopped and read what he'd written. It was the most coherent his writing had been in a while, and it gave me hope that maybe he had found his meds.

False hope, in the end.

Back home

Back where it all began.

It started when I traveled somewhere I probably shouldn't have. I don't know how long I've been moving, or how long I've been traveling, but I came across something terrible today. It was so bad that I may never travel again, even if it means that Jacob is lost to me forever.

Today I found the end of the stores, at least I think so.

I had been moving quickly between stores, feeling my mental stability eroding like a stone in a river. I was afraid that, journal or not, I eventually wouldn't be able to remember anything. Jacob, Jack, Rose, my home, my time in the Army, everything would be gone and I would just be a husk of myself. I kept going, not having any goal in mind, and eventually, I found something I shouldn't have.

I left a perfectly normal Dollar General, the only real difference being that all the products were written in a weird language, and came out onto a plane of perfect darkness. The floor floated like the tiles were levitating, and they glowed like a kid's nightlight. Between the tiles was nothing but darkness, above me was nothing but darkness, and amidst the shelves of rocks and weird fungi, I saw a multi-faced crystal that hung above the floor. It was green, an emerald diamond with so many facets that it made me dizzy, and I knew that I had to get it. It was important, too important to just leave here, but I have no idea how I knew that.

When I walked towards it, however, I saw something moving in the darkness and realized I wasn't alone.

It's hard to wrap my brain around, but the darkness there was so deep, so perfect, that the black creatures I have seen coming out of the ceiling sometimes looked like purple clouds next to it. They moved about in red eyes patrol, their heads moving fitfully to take in everything, and they were so big that I couldn't understand it. I went to the Empire State Building once when I was younger, right before I went to basic, and the smallest of them was bigger than it. The eyes swam in the sky, like meteors, and before I had taken a single step I was filled with an intense fear.

I took a step back towards the door, and when I did, I remembered something I hadn't thought about in a long time.

I remembered Jacob building things with Legos.

He built cities and buses, whole landscapes of bricks, and then he pretended to be a giant as he destroyed them with big, comical footsteps.

Looking up at these things, I felt like that must be what the little people saw as he boomed over them, and when I slipped back through the door, I came out in the store we had left.

I don't know how I did that, maybe it's something you can only do when you've come to the end? Either way, I think my traveling days are done. I don't know where Jacob is, I don't know what's become of him, but when I stand before that door and think about leaving, all I see are those towering creatures that lived in that dark place and I lose my nerve.

I don't know what I will do, but I know that it will have to be here from now on.

There were a few more entries that I could read, but most of it was unintelligible after a while. He drew pictures sometimes, but sometimes it was just streaks and half words and weird not sentences. His mental state fell apart after a few weeks or months or however long, and eventually, he just stopped using the journal at all. Who knew how long he had been here, but I knew how he had ended, and I thought now that it might have been a mercy. The old hermit, Jasper, probably would have thanked us for ending his suffering. Or maybe he wouldn't have, who's to say?

At some point, while I was reading this, it seems to have stopped raining.

I'm going to catch some zzz's and then keep moving.

I'll update you next time, my friends on the other side.

Until then, keep your eyes peeled for strange bathrooms in stranger retail chains.

See ya.
