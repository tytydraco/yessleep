It all began when I noticed a man following me on my way home from work. I didn't think too much of it at first, as I assumed he was just going in the same direction as me. But as the days went by, I started seeing him everywhere I went. He was always there, whether it was at the gym, the grocery store, or even outside my house.

Initially, he didn't do anything that alarmed me. He would simply watch me from a distance, which made me feel uncomfortable but not necessarily unsafe. However, as time went on, things started to take a turn for the worse. I began to find strange gifts on my doorstep - a single red rose, a piece of jewelry I didn't recognize, and even a lock of hair that I knew wasn't mine.

At that point, I knew something wasn't right, so I decided to call the police. Unfortunately, they didn't take me seriously. They told me that unless the man was doing something illegal, they couldn't do anything about it. I felt helpless and alone, as if nobody cared about my safety.

From that moment on, my life became a living nightmare. I couldn't sleep at night, always checking to make sure all the doors and windows were locked. I was constantly looking over my shoulder, fearing that he was always there. And then, one night, I heard a knock on my door.

I peeked through the peephole and saw the man standing there, holding a bouquet of flowers. I was petrified, but I knew I couldn't ignore him. I opened the door, my heart racing.

"Hi," he said, smiling at me. "I've been watching you for a while, and I just wanted to introduce myself. My name is Ken."

I didn't know what to do. On the one hand, he seemed harmless enough. But on the other hand, something about him made my skin crawl. Over the next few weeks, Ken became more and more persistent. He would call me at all hours of the day and night, leave notes on my car, and even show up at my workplace.

I felt like I was going crazy. I never imagined that I would be the target of a stalker. I was just a regular person living my life, trying to be happy. But all of that changed when Ken started following me.

I knew that I needed to do something. So I decided to take matters into my own hands. I started carrying pepper spray with me wherever I went and installed a security system in my home. Despite my precautions, I still felt like I was being watched. Every time I left my house, I would scan the streets for any sign of Ken. And every time I heard a noise in the middle of the night, I would wake up in a cold sweat, convinced that he was breaking into my home.

As the weeks went on, I became more and more paranoid. I knew that I needed to do something before it was too late. I went back to the police and filed another report. This time, they took me seriously, and they began to investigate.

One night, while I was sitting at home watching TV, I heard a noise outside. My heart started racing as I looked out the window, and I saw Ken standing there. I was terrified, but I knew that I needed to stay calm.

The police arrived soon after and arrested Ken. He was charged with stalking and harassment, and I was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief.

But even after his arrest, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease. I was afraid to leave my house, afraid to answer the phone, and afraid to even check my mail. The thought of Ken being out there, still watching me, still obsessed with me, was enough to make me feel like I was going crazy.

I tried to go back to my normal life, but the fear and paranoia never went away. I was constantly looking over my shoulder, jumping at every noise, and feeling like I was never truly safe.

In the end, I was left with a sense of trauma that never fully went away. Even though Ken was behind bars, I couldn't escape the feeling that I was being watched, that he was still out there, waiting for his chance to strike again.

But don't worry, I am currently undergoing treatment, and hopefully my therapy will help me heal from my trauma, and Ken won't be back in my life ever again.
