My sister was the first face I ever remembered. My very first word was “Lizzie.”

When I was a baby, Elizabeth sang me to sleep every night after my parents put me to bed. Her voice was soft and low, harmonizing beautifully with the whistle of the wind that found its way through the cracks in our old, tired house. She was everything to me, the first person to ever show me what love really looked like.

Our parents were ghosts. Not in a spooky way, but in that they were hardly ever present. They gave me the barest scraps of attention, enough to keep me breathing, sure, but never any hugs, no comfort, no affection, never offering any attention to show me I mattered.

Elizabeth filled that silence for me. While she held resentment towards them, she tried her best not to let me see it, at least early on. She always told me stories about a time before I was born, when the house was much warmer and a time when our parents smiled and laughed with her, gave her kisses and played with her. She always reassured me they were not always so distant. Though I never got to see those days, the way she talked about them and how her eyes always shimmered with a light in such a way they never could otherwise, she was always able to convince me that those days were real. I knew there would never be a time that I would get to experience it, but I still enjoyed listening to her describe it. Despite Elizabeth repeatedly assuring me that I was not the cause for their change in demeanor, I still knew I must be the reason.

I remember once, when I was maybe six or seven, I was running through the house, “bouncing off the walls like I was made of rubber” as my sister would say. Fresh from watching the new Rugrats Movie and high off the thrill, I was pretending that I was being chased by Reptar, running through our white-walled maze to escape his pursuit. The next thing I remember, I was on the floor with the color red smeared all over my hands. The pain in my forehead was instant and fierce. I started crying for Elizabeth, mostly from fear I think, but I certainly remember the sharp, stinging feeling and the coolness that followed the heat in the trail of blood running past my eyebrow.

My dad came in exasperated, being dragged away from the TV to my “incessant noise.” He wiped the blood off quickly and slapped a band-aid on me and left. Aside from telling me how loud I was being, he barely even looked at me. I knew I was just an inconvenience to them. I knew they wanted nothing to do with me.

Elizabeth shook her head at them. She knelt beside me, took my hand, and held it like I was the most fragile thing in the world. “You’re okay,” she said softly. “You’ve gotta watch where you’re going!” She pointed to the corner where I hit my head, and a small spot of red remained on the wall. I looked at it in shock, and she embraced me tighter, pulling my gaze away from it to comfort me until the sting went away. I don’t know why this moment was such a core memory in my head, but it was a moment I never forgot.

Years went by. Our bond grew stronger. My parents drifted away almost entirely once I was old enough to live alone. They practically forced me out the day I was able. But their silence and lack of affection eventually just felt normal to me, so it never really got to me as much as it probably should have. My mom only spoke three words to me before I left the house forever. The most affection I can ever remember feeling from her was in this moment. She put her hands on my shoulders and looked me dead in the eyes. “Let it go,” she said. She took her hands off me and turned away, shaking her head and looking at dad. He looked at her, then looked at me. He then disappointedly focused is gaze to the floor. They hated me.  

I still believed Elizabeth when she said they used to be different, but I never longed for it. The older I got, the more Elizabeth would open up to me about them. Trying to understand what truly broke them occupied her thoughts more often than she cared to admit. She broke down often, talking about how much she missed them. How they became hollow shells of themselves just a few months before I was born and never fully recovered. As with every time she spoke of them, she kept trying to convince me that it was never my fault, and that she even remembers them being overwhelmed with joy when they found out they were pregnant with me. She recalled that there was a brief year or so when she believed they’d actually come back to their old selves when I was born but reverted to their empty state around the time I started speaking. I always let her talk about it, but I never let her words convince me they ever gave a shit about me. That was more than enough incriminating evidence to suggest they couldn’t stand me. It was evident throughout my entire life that they didn’t need me, so I didn’t need them.  

Shortly after my 31st birthday, Elizabeth and I were tailgating in Forest Park just outside our hometown like we did every year at this time. The Fourth of July sky was turning the color of bruises, and we were ready for fireworks. We cracked our brewskis and sarcastically toasted ‘to family’ again. It was our thing, and we cracked our usual knowing grin. The first explosions painted the sky in a parade of light that made the bruised horizon feel surreal.

We were smiling, laughing, nudging each other when we were the first to spot the rockets as they shot up before they exploded. The night rolled on and we got shitfaced. The smell of gunpowder and sulfur filled the air, and we took it all in, feeling at peace. We watched as the final little rocket shot into the air. Slow and steady, it swam into the sky like a little guppy going upstream. We braced. Everyone around us braced. We all held our breath, waiting for the grand finale.

But it didn’t come. I looked up and everyone around me froze. Chatter had come to a halt, the wind stopped blowing and time stood still. I looked around, waiting for something to happen. Somewhere in that instant, it did. The explosion we were all waiting for… BANG. I hurriedly looked to the sky for the dazzling light display, but it was nowhere to be seen. I turned to look at Elizabeth in my confusion, only to be greeted with the worst nightmare my brain could process. Instead of the light filling up the sky, I watched as it left her eyes. She was dead before she even hit the ground. The world pressed play. Life stuttered momentarily, then surged forward. The muffled noises of everyone around began to fill my ears, and the sky lit up with the grand finale’s farewell burst into the sky. I looked up for help, eyes glazed over before I could so much as scream, but when I turned back to reach for Elizabeth, she had vanished.
