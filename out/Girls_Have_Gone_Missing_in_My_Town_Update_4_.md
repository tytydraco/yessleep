6:14 will forever be ingrained into my mind.

Marie and I went out hunting yesterday and Sunday. I regret everything.

Saturday was uneventful. I wore a bright orange vest while she wore her gray coat. I had joked that she'd get shot, and she just rolled her eyes and loaded her rifle. We set out shortly after noon, and before anyone asks, yes, I had salt, Holy Water in water guns, and iron. Hell, I even had some silver bullets that were family heirlooms. We walked for hours, talking about everything and nothing all at once. Around six, my mom asked when I'd be back, and I told her "before nine, at least."

Sunday was when everything went to shit. We got up earlier and drove out in her truck. The woods were silent, which shouldn't have been scary. However, the dead silence was louder than any baby crying or birdsong, and I couldn't take it after half an hour. I began talking, but Marie punched my shoulder and hissed at me to be quiet.

Then she took off like a shot and vanished into the trees. It took me five seconds to realize what had happened.

*Five fucking seconds*.

I ran after her as fast as I could, but I tripped on a root and fell into a ditch. The salt spilled from its bag, but I had to ignore it and keep going. That's when the mist set in. I ran and ran, but she knew the woods better than I do. The mist surrounded me, and it became hard to see anything. I was forced to stop and check my map, but the area looked unfamiliar. I should have known these woods, but God, it was like I was brought to a pale imitation of the place I call home.

"MARIE! MARIE, PLEASE! COME BACK! MARIE!" I remember screaming, but my words were drowned out by the silence.

**Bang, bang, bang, bang!**

Gunshots tore through the air, and I tried to make my way towards the sound. Some were louder while others for quieter and more frantic. No matter what I did, how many branches I pushed out of the way, how many times I screamed for my friend, she never stopped shooting.

I remember hearing the sound of a dog's whining, a strangled gasp-scream, then a yelp cut off but another gunshot. Blood dripped down from a branch, right over my head. I can still feel the blood, and showering repeatedly hasn't helped. When I finally managed to look up, I saw the body of a black German Sheperd. Beauty. Despite everything, I shot the branch down because I thought the Dollengangers would want to bury her. She's still in the woods, sadly.

The mist grew thicker, and I stumbled more and more. Blood ran down my face, and I still don't know when my nose started to bleed. I saw those massive hoofprints in the dirt, and that only made me speed up.

Marie started to scream.

Her voice was like a nightmare, something that wasn't human yet all too familiar. It was the scream she let out when Calla was reported missing. Even just the sound made me fall down and start crying because, fuck, I couldn't move. I couldn't think. Every ounce of strength was gone, leaving a primal fear behind.

It was 6:14 when she stopped.

I began to scream not too long after. I didn't recognize my own voice. It was a guttural sound that would make even the bravest person cry, and I moved like a puppet. My legs brought me to a clearing, and I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

Three colorless cocoons, slick with a green liquid that was not from this world. It smelled like sunscreen, candle wax, and pine sap. I watched with growing terror as two split open, and girls fell out. One was short and had black hair that stuck to her body. The other was taller and had light blonde hair. They were so unnaturally pretty, their eyes too big and limbs just a bit too long. The worst part? Watching as their hooves shrunk and twisted into regular human feet.

I dumped what little salt I had left into the Holy Water and fired at the two. It burned them a bit, so I kept going until there was nothing left. I won't forget their eyes. Even from afar, I knew they were wrong. Too animalistic, predatory.

I ran. Shit, all I could do was run.

It's now Christmas, and I have no idea what to do anymore. I'm done investig\\dfvgbbrwefcwafergtgrtgrthbtyhyuwxascdcregt6h7j76un123ERTYHJKMNBVCXZasdfghjn zAQWSE3R4T5YGRFECWXC BNTJY7IU6Y5TREWACS CV./'/..........,,,,,,,,,,,KJ6666666HGFDSQAA2qwerty77890-=-09877876t554rewxscvbnm,.,n baase
