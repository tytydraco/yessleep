I started working for Glenrock State Park three months ago. It was supposed to be an easy job—it's not some dangerous mountainous terrain filled with cougars and wolves, but a relatively flat expanse of deciduous forest.

That’s why I was surprised when, only a few days into the job, I got pulled out on a search and rescue mission.

Again, this wasn’t some dangerous terrain where lots of hikers went missing. I often saw young families with toddlers walking the mile trail to the waterfall. People would go for light jogs, have picnics and barbeques, bring their little ones to play in the stream. The surrounding towns were safe, the terrain was easy—the biggest threat we had was black bears. Which, don’t get me wrong, can be very dangerous—but still a far cry from cougars and cliffs and serial killers on the loose.

Anyway. The missing person was a young woman, about 20 years old. Her name was Heather Ricks and she had taken the red trail with her dog, a 3-mile loop into the forest. Again, like all the trails, it was an easy hike. It shouldn’t have caused any problems for her, assuming she had no underlying health conditions.

But she didn’t come home.

Her boyfriend had called the police, worried sick about her. He’d quickly ruled out all the other possibilities—she wasn’t the type to up and leave, they’d had plans the next day, he hadn’t heard from her by phone. No credit card activity.

She’d disappeared without a trace.

We began the search. Two other park rangers came with me—Donny, a young guy still working towards his degree, and Miranda, an older woman who’d been working here for years. We started off on the red trail together, scanning the woods for any sign of Heather.

I knew we were in for a bad time when we found her dog. He was roaming around about a quarter of a mile off the trail, panting and exhausted. Donny took him back to the ranger station to get him food and water. We searched the surrounding forest, kicking up leaves and scanning the bare trees, but there was no other sign of Heather.

Miranda swore under her breath.

“Dammit. Not another one.”

“Another one? Do people go missing here often?”

“We’ve had some bear attacks. Three in the last year.”

On that morbid note, we continued deeper into the woods. Around the halfway point, Miranda and I split up. She headed south, while I headed north.

“You got a compass, Mark?” she asked, when we started off.

“No. I have my phone.”

“Reception cuts out sometimes.” She dug in her bag and pulled out a compass. “I got a spare. Take this one.”

I took it, to be polite, but I didn’t plan on using it. The park was only about a mile or two wide—unless I found myself deep in a cave somewhere, I’d have reception at every point inside the park.

We continued in our opposite directions. Eventually, I came to a stream. I followed it as I continued north, watching the black water roll over the rocks. The soft gurgling, splashing sound calmed me—it sounded just like those white noise machines that’s supposed to help you fall asleep.

I pulled my phone out, just to check that I was going in the right direction.

And that's where things started getting weird.

When I opened Google Maps, the map didn't show a stream next to me. Generally speaking, the map schematic—whenever I'd used it—would show a little blue line where rivers and streams were. Even if they were relatively small.

I switched over to satellite view. Same thing—there was no cut or break in the sea of trees to show that a stream was there. It was just pure forest stretching out in every direction.

*I guess the trees are tall enough to hide it.*

I walked over to the stream. The black water lapped over the rocks, glistening in the light filtering through the waves above. My own reflection steered back at me, distorted by the rippling water.

I dipped my fingers in. The water felt slightly warmer than it should be—not by much, but here in November, I'd expect it to feel ice cold. Instead, it was only cool.

I shook my head and stood up. Then I continued further into the forest.

“Heather,” I called out, scanning the trees. “Heather, can you hear me?”

No reply. Just the birds chittering, the wind rustling the leaves.

I lost sight of the stream as I continued north. And then, about 20 minutes later, I did find something of Heather’s. My heart stopped when I saw it. A purple knitted hat, lying on the forest floor.

It was one of the items she’d been last seen with, according to her boyfriend. I had a whole list of things to look out for, things that might belong to her.

I took a photo and texted Miranda and Donny. When they didn’t reply right away, I decided to head further into the forest.

*Maybe she’s still alive. Maybe she needs my help.*

I continued forward, scanning the forest floor for her white puffer jacket, her pink sneakers. Anything that stood out against the mass of brown before me.

And about 10 minutes later, I did see another flash of color. I ran towards it, heart pounding—and found her jacket on the ground.

Except—there was something wrong with it.

Her jacket was laid out perfectly on the ground. It wasn’t bunched up or twisted or tangled, like you’d expect it to be if she’d gotten into a fight with an attacker. It was laid neatly across the leaves, without even a wrinkle.

*And it was zipped up.*

The cogs in my brain turned as I stared at it. *That means… someone zipped it up… after it came off her.* 

*Unless she took it off on purpose? Zipped it up and lay it there, to pick it up later?* But that didn’t make a lick of sense. It had been between 30 and 40 degrees all week, even at the warmest parts of the day. Nobody would voluntarily take off their jacket and leave it in the forest.

Which only meant one thing—

Someone had left it here.

On the ground.

*Deliberately.*

For us to find.

I lifted my gaze and scanned the trees, my heart pounding. The forest was silent now—too silent. I didn’t hear the calls of birds, or the rustling of leaves. It was just pure silence, ringing in my ears.

And then—

*Ding-ding-ding!*

I jumped about a foot in the air as my phone made a texting sound. Hands shaking, I pulled it out of my pocket. To see a text from Miranda.

*Go back to the ranger station immediately.*

As I glanced at the photo of the hat I’d sent her, I noticed it, too, had been lain perfectly across the ground. I quickly snapped a photo of the jacket and sent it over.

*I found her jacket. But it looks like it’s been… staged?*

Three dots appeared, indicating Miranda was typing a reply. Then:

*GET OUT OF THERE NOW*

*Snap.*

The sound of a stick breaking. I glanced up—and saw movement among the trees. I couldn’t see anything, between the crisscrossing trunks and overhanging leaves—just a flash of shadow, a flash of movement.

I broke into a sprint. A few minutes later, I pulled out my phone to make sure I was going the right way. It took me longer than I would’ve liked, but finally, I made it back to the trail. Even though my lungs were burning and my legs were aching, I forced myself to sprint back down the trail.

I didn’t let myself stop until I was at the ranger station/visitor center at the front of the park, panting wildly. Then I slipped inside and collapsed into a chair.

Miranda was on the phone with someone. She eyed me as I came in, and then continued to the unknown caller:

“Yes. Vacate immediately. Tell them—tell them it was another bear attack, and it isn’t safe.”

A pause.

“Let me know when you’re done.”

She hung the phone back up on the receiver and turned towards me. “We’re vacating the park. Can you set this up at the trailhead?”

She threw me a roll of yellow CAUTION tape, then handed me a red sign that read CLOSED.

“Uh, okay…”

“Donny should be here any minute. When you see him, tell him to help you clear out the parking lot. Davis and Jackie are clearing out the trails, so they don’t need any help there.”

I had a million questions, but I did as I was told. Donny came back just as I was hanging up the sign, and the two of us cleared the parking lot. Less than an hour later, the park was empty, the gate was closed, and the five of us were holed up in the ranger station.

Jackie, Davis, and Miranda seemed to know something we didn’t. They talked in hushed tones in the back room with the door locked.

Which left Donny and me, sitting in the main room with nothing to do.

“She doesn’t want us to leave,” I said, tapping away at a stupid mobile game on my phone. “Which is dumb, because we’re not doing anything here.”

“Still getting paid, though,” Donny replied. “Isn’t that a good thing?”

“Yeah, I guess.”

An awkward silence settled between us. Donny was about ten years younger than me, I think, and I wasn’t sure what I had in common with some Gen Z teenager. I wracked my brain for something to talk about—but came up empty.

“She didn’t tell you what was going on?” I asked again.

He shook his head.

“There’s no way it’s bears.”

“I think it’s some serial killer on the loose,” he said. “But they don’t put that on the news, because they don’t want people to panic. I mean, laying down her clothes all nicely like that, luring you out somewhere… that’s serial killer behavior, for sure.”

*Very helpful, Donny,* I thought sarcastically. But I kept my comments to myself.

I stood up and walked over to the window. It was starting to get dark outside; the sky had turned an intense shade of deep-blue, in the throes of dusk. All the crepuscular animals had begun to stir: birds flitting back to their homes, deer moving about. I reached up to close the curtains—

Something caught my eye.

*No.*

The CAUTION tape I had so carefully strung across the trailhead had been torn in two. The CLOSED sign lay on the ground. I squinted, my heart beginning to pound.

It had been fine twenty minutes ago, after we cleared the parking lot.

*Maybe it was just a deer.*

*Maybe a deer tripped over it and ripped it with its hooves…*

But as I stood there, staring out into the darkness, I saw something else.

A shape, just at the treeline, on the other side of the parking lot.

It didn’t move. I squinted, but in the darkness, it could’ve been anything: an oddly-shaped tree trunk, a fencepost, a bush. Still—the way my eyes immediately snapped to it—I wondered if it wasn’t there before.

If it was someone standing there.

I squinted—

The door creaked open behind me. I turned around to see Miranda, Jackie, and Davis walking into the main room. Donny stood up and began asking them about the bear attacks. I turned back to the window.

My blood ran cold.

The shape was no longer [there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)
