[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ot9vpt/downpour/)



The beast didn’t make a noise until the next morning. Shuffling, rifling, I opened my eyes groggily. The canvas bag I left at the door. At first I was surprised. Why is that still there? Then I blinked again and adjusted my eyes. There he was, that beast, making the first noise I ever heard from his lips as he crunched away on my chanterelles. I exhaled through my nose, throwing my head back into the pillow and looking up at the clouds through my fogged window. There was a seeping cold flowing flatly through the small lift that opened it. It made me shiver and sent me up into a sitting position, as I watched the dog turn his snout left and right, brushing away the canvas to reach further into the bag. I sighed, happy he was finally eating, but that wouldn't do for me. The woods called for me again, not out of malcontentious longing, but because of a pain in my stomach. What's left of the hares were gone, and there may very well be several waiting for me on the snares I laced along the trail.

So the routine was set, the die was cast, and the time to overcome my fears of trees and moss had come. A fresh dip into my bags of clothing heralded my departure. Fresh jacket, fresh pants, fresh sweater, spoiled muddy boots. For now my old pair of sneakers will have to do. I checked my phone. Off, but charging at 2%. Hopeful. The moment I opened the door that gale hit me once again. A gust of wind nearly folded my wrist back as I struggled. And then, it turned gentle. Calming. Ambient cool wisps brushed against my cheek and blew strands of hair behind me as I stepped down my stairs. The beast was behind me. He lumbered down them as well, his nose to the ground as he resumed what I figured was his favorite activity. I wondered if he'll go back to walking in circles, but for now I figured the freedom of choice was all I could afford him. So I didn't look back as I left the door open, leaving him to his whims. Yet instead, he followed.

I found my pace shortening as I neared the trees. They looked taller, demanding, rugged. The boughs and branches that would softly curve downward to envelop the floor now looked like twisting arms suffocating the light from the ground. And the ground was dead-- devoid, drowning. The grim wind that greeted me when I opened my door was pouring out of it like a floodgate, and every few minutes seem to recall and inhale that warm breeze coming from out of its grasp back in. I glanced behind me as I stood at the treeline. Five feet from me, the beast had stopped. And he was looking. That cloudy eye stared me down like a blizzard on the horizon. I froze, trying to stay calm. How did he know how tall I was? To look me directly in the eye, I couldn't see it, but I could feel it. My tongue caught in my throat as I swallowed a half-smile. "You're not coming then?"

The beast turned, putting his head low until his nose touched the grass. He sniffed his way back to the gravel, tracing circles as I disappeared into the pines. Despite the canopy, the storm felt harsher here. Droplets of water seemed to coagulate into deeper prospects that dripped slimily from the tips of boughs, hitting the ground with heavy thuds that drowned out the noise of the woods. Every step was wet, soggy, and required my full conscious in order to pull through to the next. A droplet splayed my cheek as I cleared a line of brush, finding my trail at last as I began to follow it down through the mist.

The packed dirt in front of me was a thin array of mud, winding as it drooped into a steep incline before flattening out, while armies of pines dangled over, covering the sky with sharp green needles that stabbed and prodded, all vying for the dominance of sunlight. They fell against my shoulders as I sidestepped my way down, the mud creasing my sneakers and making me wobble with each step. I didn’t find my first snare. Two bushy roots loomed low over the trail, making a perfect tunnel for which I laced my string. But it wasn’t there. I stepped over it and continued my muddy march. As I walked along, I heard the hum of the stream.

It came as a slight whisper, tickling the back of my ears. But as I made my way to the next snare, I found the hum of the wash increasing louder and louder the further I got through the trail. Being in a hungry daze and so close to my second snare, I gritted my teeth and walked on, following the path that seemed to directly lead to the torrent. As the reverberation of the river increased, I found it difficult to hear any sounds of the forest, as the storm surged. But there as I cleared the next pine stood my snare. And on it, a gift from the forest.

A hare dangled listlessly in the wind from the top of a root, its neck cracked and head drooping palely against the snare. I approached the forest’s gallows cautiously. Yellow powder crusted the thing’s lips, oozing like sap, and its ears scraped the black bark of the roots as it teetered back and forth. The thing’s fat bottom nearly touched the ground hanging there, with its white feet turned a sickly gray having stewed in a murky puddle below the trap. Its eyes were wide open in a haze of grey and brown, no pupil visible. Beggars can’t be choosers. I unceremoniously stripped my knife from my belt and cut the creature loose, stuffing it in my canvas bag with little thought other than relief that my luck wasn’t all bad. As I rested the bag against my chest, I felt the carcass against my heart, and both seemed to beat in tune.

But the ringing in my ears was nauseating, and I pressed on to the next snare. The hum of the river made the trail seem to vibrate, playing tricks on my eyes as I began to see it in two renditions. The vibrations made my feet numb, and the icy wind carried it up to my legs as I walked made of jello further and further down the path. Water fell all around me. My mind told me to leave while I was ahead, but a gnawing thought in the back of my mind convinced me that the ringing would only be worse should I head back. Yes, the stream was back where I came, and I was doing well to continue away from it.

Firelight bloomed in the distance. I recognized it as I would any other day. My ears were stifled but my eyes could see the burning rays of light through the shadows of the pines. I walked towards it, and the trail straightened into a simple path that seemed to overtake the roots that had previously dominated it. I treaded on, and the light broke through more and more trees until confusion overtook me. I saw the chanterelles. They burned in daylight. The grass I saw through the canopy gleamed like shining topaz, and glistening rays of light ignited the canopy in beautiful rays of gold. The storm had broken ahead, and I nearly broke into a run as I realized it. The hum grew sharper, and the pines parted like a curtain. The forest seemed to separate into a perfect circle, and a glowing pond of grass and white flowers bloomed under its radiance. The mushrooms formed all around the treeline, as if holding back the tides of pine and root that encompassed everything else.

And there, on a broken log in the back end of the clearing, was magic itself.

Cloven hooves dug into the grass, and muscled pink legs rose above it. Its waist was covered in dark brown fur with a belt of odd hide fastened across. The chest was bare, but its shoulders folded into the same dark hair. A bull’s tail swung back and forth in the sunlight. And atop its shoulder, a goat’s head. Two horns dug into its skull, riding to the sky as the grey bone burned like ivory in the light. The creature’s pupils were perfect rectangles, separated by its long snout and flashing in amber. My body froze as it stared at me. It crossed its hooves, fleshy hands gripping the dark brown calves. I tried to speak, but my voice caught in my throat, and the thing’s head tilted. It waited for me, not moving, hardly breathing.

“What are you..?”

The creature grinned, a set of perfectly square teeth bore all across its maw. Light green tinted in stains along the tips. No fangs, no front, just perfect white squares.

“I am an angel.”

The voice was like honey, deep and floral. A breeze blew as it spoke, and the smell from the stream permeated back into my mind while the wind carried it. The sun bristled at my nose, while rays of light burned away the downpour. It was as if I just removed a large coat, the feeling of freedom was intoxicating. I felt I could run a marathon as I took a step closer.

“You don’t look like an angel.”  
“I haven’t bathed.”

That smile again. I was so lost by the sudden vanishing of rain I had little conscience left to even process what I was looking at. I wiped my face and looked again. The angel’s side-facing eyes strained to look directly at me, with white chalk-like bags underneath each wrinkling as it seemed to squint. I struggled for questions, even words. My mind was a cacophony of fear and wonder as I pondered such an impossible creature. But the gnawing in the back of my head assured me that there was no other cause for this creature besides divine providence. I took a step forward.

“Why are you here?”  
“I live here.”  
“Why have I not seen you before?”  
“I did not want to be seen.”

Tears formed in my eyes. I shuddered in the light like a bug exposed to a torch.

“You are not real.”  
“Feel my heart, and know.”

I was standing next to the angel. My arm unfolded, and my glove was off, trembling as I reached for it. A tremor went through my hand as I felt its heat. My palm was on his chest.

Badum. Badum. Badum. Our hearts beat in sync. A tear fell from the pit of my eye.

“Why now?”

I removed my hand, but the beating of the celestial still quaked.

“I pitied you, human. I saved your life.”  
“Why?”  
“The beast of the woods hunted you as you picked my fruit. The fault was mine.”

The beast of the woods. The shadows in the pines. The raven. That creature stalked from tree to tree, chasing me as I fled in horror. I left that day in a suit of mud and stupor. But the raven. The angel’s slit pupils regarded me warmly.

“The raven?”  
“Mine own.”  
“And the beast?”  
“Mine enemy.”

I mumbled nothing. An exasperation of denial and confusion as I stood next to it. The angel smiled knowingly. The stream, the trail, the mushrooms and the forest. None were mine. All were the estate of the angel. I stood in his temple, and I felt small and insignificant in his altar. My bag twitched.

“What do you want from me?”  
“I want to help you.”  
“What will you do?”  
“I can return the one you love.”

I took a step back. The angel’s eyes followed. My eyes darted across the blue sky, and I stopped to watch a billowing white cloud float far above the storm. I looked down, and the angel awaited his answer.

“I have not lost anyone I love.”

Unblinking, the angel resounded a deep whisper.

“I’m afraid you have.”  
“Who?”  
“I did not see.”  
“Then how do you know?”  
“The beast took them.”

I tilted my head, and the angel did the same. He looked at me grimly, like a man would look at a dying animal. Pity. His pity filled me with dread. What had I lost? Although I was looking down on him, it was as if he stood 20 feet tall when I stared.

“I haven’t lost anyone.”

His countenance darkened. His eyes lowered and he roughly exhaled through his snout. The angel’s lips vibrated.

“Then go home, Jack. And I will see you again.”

I stepped backwards. And another. My feet were moving on their own. My hand raised to feel the angel’s heart again, but he was too far. I began to hear the rain. I turned my feet sideways to stop, but they straightened and my hips began to turn. The pines were ahead of me. The storm was pounding. I looked back, and it was all gone. My imagination. Definitely not. I began to run. My heart and my mind were shattered. The hum of the far away river and the beating of the angel’s heart still reverberated through my brain. I felt no pain in my body as I ran through the forest, dashing from tree to tree down the path like a wild beast. I loved nothing.

———————————

The corpse regarded me lifelessly. She was split in half. The seams of a small black jacket twisted unnaturally into a tangle of bright red flesh that dripped onto the wet wood. Shiny red teeth clumped with brain-matter atop her shoulders. Who was she? My mind was blistered. A pounding migraine roared in my skull. I stepped inside. The room was cool, and empty. For the first time in hours, it was quiet. The pestering storm halted at the door’s latch, and only the shriek of the chair accosted my ears as I sat down. I sat there for some time, listening to nothing. I stared at wood. Where was he? I looked behind me. The dog was gone, and I closed my eyes.

My thoughts drifted away. Vines, horns and slit eyes. Roots coiled around my throat. And I awoke in a gasp. I fell forward, hitting my chin on flat logs as my eyes drifted to the door. I laid there for some time, thinking of all I had experienced. I could not recall which was real and which was a dream. I pictured the beast, and the angel, and dead hare still on my back. I shuddered as my nail scratched at the wood. The door was red underneath.

Rosa.

I ran outside in a panic. The door clattered loudly behind me as I threw it open. There she was. Her legs calmly laid flat towards the railing. The rest of her was in two pieces.

I collapsed. Tears began to stream from my face, and my cheeks burned. My palm was covered in her blood. I placed my hand on her leg, and looked for anything resembling the person I had spent the entirety of my life with. Black hair, pale skin. So much blood. I sobbed.

“I love you, Rosa.” My words were a whimper. “I love you.” I wiped my face with her blood on my fingers. My only family member in the world reduced to a viscous liquid. The rain pounded on the wooden canopy. And all I could do was sit there. There was nothing to hold. My palm clawed childishly at her pants as I wept. My other smashed the floor as hard as I could, my nails biting into my palm as I struck the ground over and over and bawled. I remembered the words from before.

“I can return the one you love.”

The words formed in my head so vividly that I raised my eyes and my mouth went wide. The entirety of my vision was blood. A red vignette enclosed my eyes. I looked behind me.

He sat in the mud, in the pathway I had walked so many times before. His knees were pointed outwards, and his two hooves fit into each other like puzzle pieces. His palms were resting upwards on his lap. Water matted his fur and darkened his skin, and his horns dripped thick tears that pounded against the ground. The angel returned, but the rain persisted.

I shambled down the steps, stumbling and tripping as I approached it. Salt from my eyes filled with the taste of fungus swelling my tongue. I lurched towards the angel like a wretched, pained animal heeling to its master. The angel grinned as he looked up at me.

“I am sorry, Jack." His mouth contorted into a frown. "The fault is mine.”

My lips furrowed and I let out a pathetic mumble. I fell to my knees. The angel’s eyes regarded me merely a few feet apart. My bloody palm gripped mud and dirt tightly as I trembled.

“Can you bring her back?”  
“I can.”  
“How?”

I stared for some time at the angel, and then blinked. The pines vanished. The world seemed to collapse around me. The mud and dirt and grass all drowned. I turned back, but my cabin had vanished into a sea of grey water. All around me an endless abyss of shallow ocean, with no horizon in sight. The sky was a matte gray. The water shimmered in clouded gray light. I saw my reflection as I looked down. Bloody, filthy, wretched. The dead hare lay next to me. It twitched and blinked. I saw the reflection of the angel as well. Its toothy smile shimmered in a single ray of moonlight that struck the sea. I looked up at him again, and he was the entire world. Rain pattered his horns.

“You need only sign.”

The rain stopped around us. Puddles rippled softly into the sea and curled around my knees. I stared down at my visage again and sobbed. All was quiet, and the angel looked at his as well. The silence was so deafening I felt as if the entire world had ended, and I would simply vanish like the rest. But then the water moved again. It rose from the sea, rising upward into droplets as if the very storm had reversed itself. I watched in awe as bits of the gray torrent floated all the way into the sky, dissipating into the clouds. A pool of droplets began to congeal in front of me. Rising above the ocean, it formed a ball that swirled between us. And then it flattened. Flattened like paper as it unfurled and took color.

A sickly white hue of thin paper floated in front of my knees. Archaic, foreign black symbols stippled its flesh. My index finger began to bleed. I raised it to my eyes and saw a thin pinprick of dark crimson blood dripping into the sea. I glanced at the angel, who regarded me with a wide smile. A long black line pinned the end of the scroll.

“Only I can save her.”

My hand trembled. Only HE can save her. I was a powerless insect. The angel of the woods, come to free me from the beast. My tears of anguish began to form into tears of joy. I thought of Rosa. Her laugh, her smile, the way she pushed at my chest when she was mad at me. I remembered her heartbeat from my childhood as we slept together. Badum, badum, badum. I would give anything to see her again. I would give my heart and my soul just to see her laugh. I brought her here, to the woods, and to the beast. And I would have to atone for the sins. The angel would cleanse me.

I pointed my finger forward. The blood formed a small pool below me, and I reached for the scroll. A small tint of blood splashed the bottom of the paper, and its corner shriveled in response. The blood stopped as I reached to place my print.

And then my ears started to ring. A flash burned my retina, and all of reality seemed to blink in a blitz of light and sound. I felt something hit my chest. Pieces of rock or metal, shredded against my jacket and through my chest as I fell onto my back into the water. I coughed and weezed and rolled to my side as my bleeding hand gripped my stomach. My right hand bit into the ground, and for some reason, I felt dirt.

I opened my eyes, and there was pines. Pines and mud, my face burrowed in it. I gasped humid air as I tried desperately to take sense of my surroundings, and fell back onto my back.

There, standing over me, a dark silhouette loomed, eyes wide and mouth agape in a contortion of pure horror. I wiped my eyes with the back of hand and tried to make sense of the figure.

“Rosa?” I whimpered.

The figure stared down at me. No, much too big to be Rosa. It knelt down, and all I could see was a scared, worried face. I had seen that face before.

Something metal and cold was laid at my chest. Two large, fleshy arms reached under me, lifting me up into the sky. I laid limp against them. There was warmth, in my chest, then hot pain. Two massive bulky shoulders supported my dead weight. I looked up. I saw perhaps the squarest jaw I've ever seen.

“I’m so sorry, Jack I-“ His burly voice caught in his throat. “I didn’t know you was behind him I-I-I didn’t know!” Jona said in a worried drawl.

“W-what the hell was that!?” A shotgun rested between my legs as he carried me. The old man was jogging down the path, his words drifting away as I dreamed. I dreamed of a boat, of clouds and of shores. The rain pattered lightly against my face as I stared up at the clouds. It was soft, calm, and a warm breeze tickled my skin and combed my hair. I opened my eyes truly for the first time in ages. The trees glowed brightly in the autumn haze. The sky was a foggy blue that covered the road in a plethora of pale colors. I smiled softly and looked up at Jona.

“Hang in there, buddy, we’ll be there soon.” I drifted my head downward and looked forward.

A lone beast plotted the road ahead of us. An old, blind dog, nose to the pavement, limping briskly through the warm fall rain. His nose sniffed at the ground.

“You’re lucky he found me, boy! He came to my door scratching and gnawing and hollering and the moment I went outside he went right on up the road! I closed the door and he did it again! Can you believe it?”

I smiled. Good boy. So angels were real. And they were old dogs and old men.
