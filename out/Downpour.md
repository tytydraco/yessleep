The rain was torrential. There is an all-encompassing sensation when standing in the midst of such a storm. Your hearing is drowned by the onslaught. The water trails down your face, stifling your nose and blurring your vision. Your fingers clutch in your jacket, gripping damp fabric. Your chin naturally tilts downward to avoid it. All of your senses focused on the ground, to the tempestuous tapping of the wash. All of my senses were focused on the ground.

I was heading home. That’s what the road told me. I wasn’t sure from where I exited, but I was glad of it. My mind was adrift. Lost in the rain. The pavement curved and bent like a serpent, dragging me left and right, and left again. I shambled along the edge, between the black road and the lush, green grass. Soon, the path diverted. Left, left, and left again. Then I knew I was heading home.

I had walked this road many times before, but never blind. But I knew the way. And now, more than ever, I knew my way. I was enlightened, because magic was real. I had seen it. Magic, aether, witchcraft, enchantment. Something was real. But I couldn’t think about it. I had to get home. I couldn’t think in this.

My head tilted upwards. There was a color adrift in the sea of gray and green. Brown. Home. I quickened my pace, my feet clambering against the murky puddles in the path, my sneaker dipping once too far into a hole of reclaimed gravel. The cold in my foot jolted me awake, the water creeping into my sock and leaving an uncomfortable slosh with each step I took. I looked up again. Brown, and red.

I stood against the base of the steps. Pine logs, split in half by my own two hands. It filled me with great comfort, my ark against the flood. I climbed hastily, my left hand gripping the wooden rail tight as I saw how pale it had become. My drowned foot nearly slipped as I rushed to be under the awning. The relief was immediate, as the downpour lost its intensity the moment I breached under. The last bits of water dripped from my face, and I wiped my eyes with a slippery sleeve then breathed deep the humid air. Yes, I could breathe again. I looked upwards. Red.

Did I know this woman? My mind wandered. My window was broken, I noticed. Fractured through the middle with sharp, wet shards clinging against the wooden frame. A tinge of deep crimson clung to one of them. The same color as the sight below me. This woman. Did I know her? I couldn’t tell. She was split in half. Her face was unrecognizable, save for the black, damp hair clung to what remained of her skull. Where the rest of her head would be, void. Some monstrosity had cleaved her into two. Tendrils of muscle and sinew desperately reached from one side of the corpse to the other as if trying to reconnect, but they never met. Bits of unrecognizable flesh clung to her jacket like morbid ornaments. Her arms lay upturned on either side, her palms facing up. My eyes followed them. Deep red blood splatter littered the roof of my canopy, the force of her demise painting the planks I called my home. Her waist and lower half were intact, slumped against my cabin, legs placed together in a nightmarishly calm contrast to the rest of her body. For a brief moment, I contemplated checking her pulse. What was I thinking? I opened the door, and went inside.

So magic is real. And so are angels. What else?

———————————

It had been seven months since I gave up on the world. It started as a hobby— a personal vent for the frustrations of a miserable, monotonous life. Self sufficiency. To stand alone among my wooden constructs and know that I have created something more important than I ever had before. I remember the relief I felt when submitting a data entry summary to my supervisor. Faint, fleeting, plastic. The comparison to the ecstasy of building something, for me, with my own two hands, was night and day. I never felt so human before, when sweat furrowed my brow with a hacksaw in my hand and an open box of nails splayed against the soft dirt.

I was trapped before, in an office, surrounded by cold bodies in a cold cement box where I could safely generate profit. My smiles flew across silent lips. My kind words on deaf ears. Here, amongst the smell of crisp pine needles and nectar, I had freed myself from those wretched creatures that had dared to call themselves alive. I was alive, and a gentle, warm rain had grazed itself across the horizon. It was morning. 7 AM.

My window was open. A long, white cord slinked through the opening and onto the counter-top against the wall of my shelter. I made my way over to it. The rain cast a light, metallic tapping against the portable solar battery I laid flat atop a pine stump through the window. My phone flickered to life as I tapped it. 43 percent. I wouldn’t get to watch much today. I had powerbanks prepared for this, but the rain had fallen so consistently this past week my preparation had failed. I couldn’t care less. My real anxiety would come when I started to run out of coffee, and the nightmare of briefly returning to civilization would fill a pit in my stomach once more. Two missed calls, I noticed.

Jona had perhaps the squarest face you’ve ever seen. He was a blocky man in general. His body was built like a fridge, and his straight shoulders lead to large, flabby arms that would hug you the moment he realized he could call you friend. His hair was a thin, dark red, that showed the similar signs of aging as his wrinkled eyes and the dimples in his fat face that would always be smiling. He really did look dumb, but he was always thinking. And I liked him. Jona was one of my only connections to the outside world, and the labor I occasionally performed for him provided the meager amount of money I needed to sustain my lifestyle. So I was happy to talk to him, and I called as soon a I saw.

“Jack?” His voice was littered with a southern drawl. And I could tell he was smiling.

“Hey big guy, what’s the word?”

“We missed ya for Thanksgiving. Sarah wanted to show you her drawings.”

“Sorry Jona, I got busy.”

“Got a girlfriend?” Now I smiled.

“Maybe next time I’m in town.”

His laugh was a booming one, and knowing him I could tell his free hand was clutching his stomach to accentuate it. “So what’s the word?” I asked, somewhat impatiently. So much time alone has made me weary using my voice, and Jona and his family were only a short exception.

“Chant-er-ells, Jack!”

“Chanterelles?”

“The mushrooms you brought last year, Claire had her roast ready for them! But Jack was too busy to show, huh.”

“Sorry, man…”

Jona scoffed dismissively. He knew how hard it was for me to come to anything, even if he liked to pretend.

“Don’t worry about it!” He boomed. “But the missus was really looking forward to them. And I told her, huh, that if we want old Jack and his chant-er-ells around, we gotta pay him for it, hah!” I heard the stomach slapping this time.

“So when you got some time, how about you saunter on down to that secret ‘ol spot of yours and fetch us a basket? Got a twenty with your name on it!”

“Just twenty?”

“Thirty?”

“Now that’s just fine, Jona.” I mimicked his drawl.

The cabin was tiny, much smaller than my Burbank studio, but ten times as spacious. The walls were hardly walls, not because of their shoddy construction, but because the outside was shared with no-one else. The dirt, the pines, the pollen and the cabin was my apartment. And what a beauty the cabin was! Several feet of walking space, a cast iron stove, sanded counters, and a lowered room I had rigged with a camp shower that fed to a rain-catcher on the roof. The same split logs I had used for my stairs made up a small bed frame, accompanied with a mattress Claire so generously demanded I take when I informed them I was sleeping in my jacket on top of wood. The dark red sheets I clung to every night matched well. I prided myself over my handiwork as I opened the small under-croft from a latch in the corner of the floor, pulling out a fresh jacket from one of my bags and making my way to the door.

I pulled it shut as I stepped outside. Even after seven months away, my hand still reached instinctively into my pocket to look for my keys for the door. But there was none. Home invaders were a rarity. I zipped my jacket up as I glanced towards the tree line. The rain was getting heavier— not that it bothered me.

The air was sharp and biting as I approached the edge, prickling the skin of my exposed wrists above my gloves. A wind was whistling through the pines, mournful yet comforting gusts breathing renewal against my cheeks. The trees were straight as I neared it, but in my peripheral seemed to curve and bend to stay in my sight. I placed my hand against black bark as I entered, the rough surface thick with moisture that slipped my palm and made me nearly trip as I stepped over a winding root.

Silvery ribbons of gray light pierced through the canopy as I followed a game-trail deep into the woods. The rays peaked through the leaves, landing upon mossy rocks and lighting them up like faintly glowing emeralds while soft strands of water pattered against them. Wet leaves squelched under my boots as I hopped and ducked over branches, boulders, and boughs. Gnarled roots twisted into the trail as I got deeper, reclaiming the dirt that had been trodden upon. After twenty minutes or so, I heard the familiar noise I was waiting for.

A throaty hum reverberated through the pines. I deviated from my path to chase it. The dead, brown leaves and dirt began to turn into a more lush green as I neared my prize. The mist was hanging low, curling around the ancient pines like ghostly hands as I made my way through them. Ducking over one more dripping branch I reached it. My stream. Perhaps hundreds of years ago some native or settler had called it theirs, but not anymore. I took comfort knowing I was the only living man to know her, and she rewarded me in kind.

There they were, laying against the mossy streamside, tiny bolts of yellow flame reaching for the sky. My prize. They stood out so vividly against the pale surroundings it was a wonder the hares haven’t eaten them all. The guilt of removing their beauty from this world filled my stomach as I kneeled down along the stream, but the thought of fresh coffee compelled me on.

I took my glove off, placing it in my jacket as I dipped my left hand into the stream. Ice, ice cold. I cupped my hand and drew it upwards, droplets of water splashing back into the stream as I put my lips to it and drank it down. It was abnormally refreshing. I wiped my hand along the sweater underneath my jacket, and put my glove back on. The chanterelles were ripe, and I stood back up to near one, before kneeling down again and gripping it between my gloved fingers. The moisture permeated them, and the squishiness made me toughen my grip as I went to wrench it out.

Snap. A twig broke. Fifty feet away, my ears told me. And a big one. The forest fell deathly quiet. My breathing went sharp and I went still as even the stream itself seemed to deafen from the sudden noise. No birds, no frogs, no water. Quiet. I glanced through the trees.

Snap. Thirty feet? Shadows lurched through the black pines. A droplet of water hit my face and clouded my eye, and for a moment the entire forest appeared as a crowd of thin, black figures stretching to the clouds. I wiped my face and stayed silent, like a deer looking for a hunter in the bush. Just trees. I don’t know how long I stood there in silence, but when I moved again the sound in the world resumed. I plucked the mushroom out remorselessly, barely moving off my knees as I went to the next, and the next, until my bag had enough that Jona wouldn’t look at me funny. Still, I noticed I was shivering. Unusual for this weather, but I brushed it off as a cold-snap.

Yes, definitely much colder. The air seemed to turn frosty as I stood up all the way, straightening my back with a stretch. The fog of my breath suddenly seemed more pronounced as I warmed my gloves with it. But the breeze from upstream brought something else. Honey, berries, and.. Something rotting. I tilted my head and looked up the river. Just pines. Bringing my bag to my front, I opened it and inspected the chanterelles. They smelled tart, earthy, maybe sweet, but certainly not rotting.

Something was off, though. The firelight of the mushrooms I had observed when plucking them from the stream never really seemed to dissipate. It was as if they were glowing from some luminescence under the darkness of my bag. As I gazed closer, it wasn’t that simple. They were pulsing, like heartbeats. My head drifted closer into the bag, until my entire vision were the mushrooms, glowing, beating, so faintly and subtly I wanted to draw even closer to understand whether what I was seeing was real or just an imagination.

Badum, badum, badum. The chanterelles pulsated.

Snap. A sound came across the stream. I dared not look behind me. I wasn’t a superstitious man, and living alone in the woods had taught me that the things that went bump in the night were usually just rabbits and possums. But something felt so, so different. My pack seemed to beat quicker against my chest as I withdrew my head. I had to leave. I didn’t know why, but I had to. I started walking, my feet trudging through the wet grass, seemingly not able to find the grip they once had on their way in. I slipped and stumbled against wet undergrowth as I gripped and pulled through wet boughs. Farther and farther away from my stream.

I quickened my pace. The rain was heavier now, sharp, like silver needles blurring my path and picking at my hood. A feeling of dread pierced me. The foliage was dense and unrecognizable as I prayed that the game-trail was behind every bush, every pine. Looking back, I don’t know why such a sudden fear overtook me from just the sound of snapping twigs. But the ice that gripped my heart at that moment compelled me to return to my cabin as quickly as possible.

Until I cleared the next layer of brush, I had no reason to be afraid. No trail, again, but rested on a low hanging branch perched a raven unlike any I had ever seen. The top of his head was tufted, like a black jagged crown atop his head, giving him a regal presence as he stared. But it was how he stared that was the most alarming. The creature had whites in his eyes, highlighting the murky brown that made me freeze. His pupils were rectangular. The beast just stood there, staring, head turned, looking at me straight in the eyes. The beating rain was incessant. I refused to blink under his gaze.

“What?” I asked, to the non-sentient creature.

He perched only 5 feet from me, and the tension between me and this thing cut the air like knives.

“What!?!” I shouted at it.

Those awful eyes turned to my right. I looked. Water pooled in puddles between the dark pines. Dead leaves floated in clusters. I looked back at the thing, and it was still gazing that way.

Snap. A twig broke from my left. My eyes instinctively darted to it. A shadow broke among the pines, a standing shadow that blended in with the rest, darting quickly between those that stood still. It moved soundlessly, leaving only a blur of mist in its wake. The hair on the back of my neck bristled and froze. Before I knew it, I was running, more like a shambling jog on the thicket. My boots clashed noisily against the puddles, spraying water that leaped all the way up to my knees as I covered my face with my right forearm, blinking constantly to try to free my vision. Branches clawed at my sleeves, and the smell of rotting fruit seemed to permeate through the forest. I spat rain.

After what seemed like an eternity of my desperate scrambling, I tripped. The soft grass that hit my face certainly didn’t feel that way. I laid there quietly, listening to the rain as my nose dug into mud. Finally, I looked up. A brown twisting serpent clung to the floor. The trail. Bitter adrenaline shot into my veins as I quickly rose to my feet. Mud littered my jacket and I saw it on my cheeks in my peripheral. I resumed the run, following the path quickly as the ground was easier to push myself through. It wasn’t long before I saw what felt like heaven itself. The trees broke, and the mist that swirled through the pines seemed to dissipate at its edge. I crashed through, and instantly the air was soft and open again. What the hell was I even running from? A bird?

The snaps had faded, but my heart was still pounding, and I tasted copper in my mouth. Putting my arm to my forehead once more I searched my surroundings. The cabin was there. But something else was as well. A car was parked on my path, nose facing the cabin, both tires dug into the grass that had been no more than a shod of gravel for walking. I didn’t even have a license. I approached cautiously.

There, arms crossed, was a woman leaning against my window. Her hair was black, her eyes hazel, and her lips were pouty. I stared. She stared back at me, just like that god damn bird. I walked in silence towards the rail, looking up at her until I neared the steps. Finally, she spoke.

“So this is what you do now?”

I looked down. My jacket was caked in mud. Strips of wet grass clung to my hair that stuck to my cheek. My nose was covered.

“I got lost.” I stammered.

She scoffed, rolling her eyes and tightening her arms closer to her chest. I felt the disappointment in her as she looked me up and down.

“What are you even doing here?” She asked in a sigh. I sighed too.

“Do you want to come in?”

I climbed the steps in silence. I could feel her watching me. I wanted to tell her to leave, that she didn’t belong here, that her cropped jacket was stupid and impractical, but instead I pulled at the latch and opened the door. She took a peek inside, stood there for a few moments, and then went in. I went in after her.

The moment I latched the door, the sound of the rain fled, and the constant ringing of my ear finally leaving put me at peace. I leaned against the logs and breathed deep. I was so glad to be indoors and not being pelted by water I had completely forgotten the woman sauntering around my kitchen, picking up my one pot in her hand and inspecting the bottom of it, while her other traced along my counter-top. She took the few steps to the other wall, bending down and opening the stove-door with her long nails. I looked at her dismissively.

Finally, she made her way to my bed, sitting on the edge of it facing me and crossing her legs. I placed my pack on the ground next to the door. She looked up at me with a smile that would almost come off as polite if her eyes moved with it at all.

“So.. This is what you do now.”

I sighed again, walking past her towards the slump in the corner of my room. I turned on the camp shower and felt the cold rainwater hit my face once more. I wiped with both palms, wrenching the mud and grass off my face before forcibly pushing it off my jacket. It clumped together on the dirt floor of the hole. She didn’t say anything else, and I was the first to speak as I buried my face into a soft towel I had on the shelf next to me.

“Do you want coffee?”

She scoffed again. Annoying, I thought, so annoying. She looked around the room again, before looking at me puzzlingly.

“Is this about Mom?” She asked.

I rolled my eyes, grabbing the pot she scrutinized and turning on the camp shower again, filling it near the brim before shoving it into the stove, kneeling down and retrieving a lighter from the top of it to light the tinder I had already prepared. The fire brought warmth to the room that my sister could never hope to achieve.

“Mom didn’t even care about us.” I retorted.

“So then why do this?” She put her palms up and looked around to make a point.

“I like it here.” I stared at the fire.

“You don’t even have air-conditioning.”

“You’re so stupid.” I argued.

I stood up, facing her with the fire at my back as I took off my jacket and placed it on the ground next to the flames.

“Is that why you drove all the way out here? To make fun of me? How did you even find this place?”

She smiled and turned up her chin at me.

“Your card was used for a few months at that market down the road. All it took was a few questions before I found that fat guy. Is he your family now?”

“He’s a friend.”

“Oh I know, believe me. It took only about two minutes before he invited me to dinner.”

I didn’t respond, and that must’ve angered her. She snapped, clapping her hands together.

“Stop dodging my questions! What are you doing out here!? Playing survivor in the woods? What’s wrong with you!? First I hear you get a promotion to middle-management, and then next I hear you quit and then your phone is off and…”

I zoned out. She trailed on with countless questions about my absence. I wrapped my hand around the same towel as she pattered on and retrieved my pot of boiling water from the stove. I dripped it through my primitive filter and through the ground beans into two cups, then brought it to her as she was still talking. She didn’t react, so I placed it on the shelf next to my bed, and sat down in a crude chair next to the fire. She stopped talking as I finally responded.

“It wasn’t about mom. I hated my life. I was late every fucking morning because I couldn’t get out of bed. I was miserable. Didn’t you notice? Every single day. The same fucking thing. How do YOU live like that?”

She stared at me for a moment with those annoying hazel eyes, and shrugged.

“So this is the solution? Build a cute little cabin, make a fire, put a shower in it and what? Hang out with an old guy the rest of your life? Am I going to find you dead here one day?”

“Probably.”

She stood up, her fists clenched as her nails dug into her own skin. I saw the anger and feeling of betrayal in her eyes as I stared blankly. Steam rose from her lonely cup.

“Well go die then! See if I care!” She pointed at her chest. “I’m not the one who gave up, that’s what you did, you gave up! You had a few bad days and ran away. Does that remind you of anyone?!”

I knew she was speaking about our father, but I never knew him, and he certainly wasn’t anything like me. Even if she had any memories of him, she was only a few years older than me, so I doubted they meant anything. Why should I care if she thinks I’m like him?

“No, it doesn’t remind me of anyone.”

“YOU are an idiot, Jack.”

She pulled at the latch to my door. It didn't open. I sighed, putting my palm over hers and pushing the latch sideways so it actually unhinged. She flinched as we touched, and I quickly pulled away once it was free. The door opened to a cool breeze flying inside. It was traded for her as she quickly made her way down my stairs. They looked rigid, more clumsily made than I remember, like a child playing with sticks as she made her way down. A wet black feather clung to the top step.

She didn’t turn as she walked to her car door, boots splattering the rain as it dampened her hair. Finally, she looked back, and I couldn’t tell if there were tears in her eyes or just rain. Her voice was ragged.

“I love you Jack, please take care of yourself.”

“I love you too, Rosa.”

The forest and I watched her leave.

———————————

Several days past before I would venture into those woods again. They no longer seemed as homely as they had once. The bright, shining rays of light that would bounce between the leaves now cackled in hues of dark gray that seemed to sharply cut from branch to branch. A harsh wind was blowing out of them at all times of the day, and at night it sent an ominous whistle that made me shiver as I relieved myself at the edge. And the rain. The rain never stopped. Every day I expected it to part. Every day I was disappointed. For the next few days, the only thing that broke the monotony was the return of that old dog.

I saw him first before the storm came, and never expected to see him again. Old, skinny, black and blind. He had droopy ears and a long dark snout with white bristles at the tip fitting for his age. One of his eyes was scarred, and the other white with cataracts. The dog walked with a limp, quite efficiently as one would expect someone who has had an injury for a while would. His ribs gauntly poked from his sides, and I could only wonder how such a poor decrepit thing managed to survive.

The first time, staring through my glass, I only watched him. He roamed across the grass, his nose sniffing at the ground, idly chasing some invisible scent. Like an ant following a false trail, he walked in circles, on and off the gravel until I grew tired of watching the scene and stood up. I opened the melted icebox underneath my counter, and retrieved some smoked hare wrapped in plastic. But when I turned to open the door, he was gone. I stepped outside to scan for him, and down the road I saw him paddling along, nose to the ground and sniffing away at the dirt as he limped down the path. That was the last time I had felt the warmth of the sun, while calling for him.

But here, in the middle of this never-ending storm, he returned.

I was quicker this time. No need for my last hare if he left. The door opened with a loud creak, and there he was. Roaming in a circle outside of my cabin, and for a moment I smiled. Normalcy at last!

“Hey!” I called in as friendly of a tone as I could muster.

The hound’s body was soaked with water, dripping to the floor like udders from a cow. The only long fur he had was on his chin, matting his beard that looked as if he had just dunked it into a water bowl. I called again, but he made no attempt at responding. He continued to roam, one more circle, sniffing so close to the gravel I worried he had been inhaling rocks. So I just watched him, not like there was anything better to do with my phone dead. Finally, I grew frustrated. Was he deaf?

“Hey, come on!”

This time I patted my leg afterwards. His head immediately turned, and he began to nonchalantly began to limp towards the steps, not so much as sparing me a glance as his nose continued to smell the ground. I stepped outside, figuring I would have to carry him up the steps, but just as idly as he began to walk towards me he climbed them, barely putting any weight on the left paw that ailed him as he reached the top. The door was open, but he stopped at the window next to it, sniffing the plank under it with intention. I tilted my head as he did the same. And then he turned, and limped on inside.

Figuring he was not one much for conversation, I came through and latched the door shut after him. He quickly found his way to the stove, slinking his skinny torso between the legs of my chair, lying down with his tail and thigh next to the softly burning flames. He made no sigh that I expected from other dogs who found a comfortable spot, simply closing his eyes and going still. I retrieved one of the few remaining strips of hare I had left from before my last encounter in the woods. He didn’t react as I approached him, placing it at his nose. His eye opened, and I could see the clouds of white up close. Like a soft fog they obscured anything resembling a pupil, and I found myself overcome with pity at the thought of such a creature. How horrible it must be to lose your grip on vision and not even to know what was happening.

He sniffed once at the strip, and I grinned wide, happy to share with my new neighbor his first meal in what I assumed was a long time. Instead, he outstretched his left paw, touching the strip of jerky with calloused pads. His nails were dark and blunt, long and crooked. and there was some kind of crimson coming from between his pads. I knelt down and looked closer. Blood, old, but not very, coming from the middle of his paw. I looked at the others. His back legs looked fine, but I could not see his right, being folded against his chest. I reached out, and he did not react, so I gripped his skinny arm gently, and stretched it out. Blood, again. What the hell? A soft splatter of crimson stained the inner sides of his pad and matted the soft fur. I pushed on his paw gently to get a better look, and once again he did not react. There was some wound between them, and I couldn’t possibly tell what in the low light. So instead I got some antibacterial wipes out from my shelf, wiping both paws clean as his eyes closed and he remained motionless. After I was done, I waved the strip of jerky in front of his nose again, which he sniffed, opened his eyes, and closed them once more. He didn't pant, didn’t whine, didn’t even breathe loud enough to hear over the crackling of the stove.

I spent a long while looking at him as I stripped and got into bed. Motionless, he slept, while I tossed and turned, assaulted by the breaking of wood lost to flames and the patter of the storm through my window that seemed to grow only louder the quieter it got. When sleep finally found me, it only made me feel worse. Vines, horns and eyes. Roots coiled around my throat, tasting of iron and spores. That's all I dreamed of.
