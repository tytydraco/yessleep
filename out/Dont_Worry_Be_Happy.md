I slowly stashed the divorce papers I was going to serve my wife in my expensive, soft to the touch leather briefcase. I released a deep breath reliving the heartbreak in her eyes as she fell to the floor when a few months ago I told her I wanted a divorce. Her begging to try and it make her work her willingness to do anything as she rocked back and forth. While sad, I even teared up which is rare, it didn’t move me enough to be willing to work on it.

To give some backstory on our relationship I met Aria online and was head over heels in a month. She was a beautiful goddess, and I was an overweight tech nerd which she saw past, despite me being at my highest weight at the time due to depression. She knew about music and could have deep discussions with me, she made me laugh and was so sarcastic, and best of all she needed me. Aria had a troubled past riddled with trauma and other issues. I helped save her, she got her bachelor’s and then her master’s and before I knew it she had two jobs and was independent and loved contributing. I did not love it, I missed the Aria who needed me, and then felt guilty for missing for that.

Two months after getting married we found out I had cancer, stage 3b, she drove me to every appointment packed me a bag to take to chemo, even though of including a blanket because I was always cold. I beat cancer but it unfortunately led to the long-lasting impact of infertility. She did IVF because my swimmers no longer swam at all. Then we found out after the first round her 8 eggs all couldn’t make embryos because my sperm was also dead and malformed. The tears didn’t stop on her end for days and the hormones made her easily frustrated. This led me to realize I was only happy with her 50-75% of the time and that wasn’t enough.

I gave all this backstory to say: I am not willing to try and work on it because cancer taught me life is too short to not be my very happiest. I still care about my wife I don’t want it to feel like I don’t. I treat her as a friend and she just wants things done as cordially and quickly as possible, in her words I “shattered the trust that was so hard to build after trauma, abuse, and a sexual assault.” These events happened Aria was teen and young adult and the scars left are still felt in her panic attacks, anxiety of meeting anyone new, and the need to always have an exit strategy. Scars that made it hard to get to be happy 100% of the time, because the IVF hormones made her even more emotional and anxious. We fought a lot with her feelings hurt that I wasn’t giving her enough love and shows of attraction. Fairly, I am not a super sexual person, she is beautiful I just only think about sex three times a year at most.

Also, once upon a time Aria was out of my league. She was short with beautiful curves, a fit stomach, and caramel tan sun kissed skin. We met in summer; she was in her mid 20’s with gorgeous brown hair flowing down her back. I could not wait to be seen out with her and for her to meet my friends. I was proud to have her on my arm. Then things changed I started taking a rather famous weight loss drug and she gained weight from depression and IVF. All the sudden I felt I was out of her league, and life is too short to settle right?

I got in my car and drove to her new place. She said she needed space for her mental health, that it wasn’t healthy to be around a liar. Ha, like I am a liar. I’m a realist who is rarely wrong, since I think working on things is bad a move, I didn’t lie in my vows. I am just trying to not delay the inevitable. We all know dating gets harder as a woman the older you get.

She gave me a key so when she travels, I can check on the place since she moved to a new area to be with me, and I am her only connection. All her family lives about three-hour drive away so she leaves every once in a while, for a long weekend to visit them. She gave me the key in case an emergency occurs, and someone needs to be able to get in. I am her only person here. How sad is that? I opened the door and shouted “Aria!! Come on I have the divorce papers and the mediation papers lets sign and get this done!!” 

Weirdly I was met with silence and darkness, Aria’s fear of the meant the place usually glowed like a jack-o-lantern. This was strange and my gut was telling me I needed to find a light source as quickly as possible. While not scared of the dark, being unable to see your surroundings is an immediate disadvantage and I needed to rectify that.

As I reach over to turn the lights on something is attached to the switch. And it’s blocking my access making it impossible to turn on the switch. Panic sets in, I need light, I need to remove this obstruction immediately. It feels cold and metallic and clatters to the floor as I rip it out of the way. Light crimson starts to seep from my hand, and it tingles with pain as my brain tries to process what just cut me. I turn on the lights and encounter broken glass everywhere, a house ripped apart where a clear struggle took place. There was also blood, blood that wasn’t from my wound. There was no way my tiny cut could cause a pool on the floor like that, and it did not splatter all over the walls.

 I look down and pick up the knife that has clattered to the floor. What is happening here? Is Aria hurt? Why was a knife on the switch? Is this Aria’s blood? So many questions racing through my brain. As the adrenaline from the cut and from intaking the scene started to subside I started to think logically. And logically only one thing could possibly make sense.

As the puzzle is starting to fall together, I stood there for hours realizing I need to call the police, wondering why. Why would Aria do this to me? We were amicable right? We were friends, right? The blood, my prints, the weapon, the separation. In the simplest terms I was beyond fucked.

I finally called the police after I couldn’t put it off any longer and they arrived promptly. They took in the scene and me. Listened to my story of what happened and ending with the truth of I have absolutely no idea whose blood that is or where Aria is. My mind was racing between she was really in danger and the kidnappers took weird measures and this fucking bitch set me up. What did I do to her?!

An investigation ensued and just as I suspected, I am suspect number one. Apparently, Aria had been calling her family for months since I said I wanted a divorce and telling them she fears for her life around me lately. That I was angry. She even had a folder of recordings of me yelling about her about things prior to the separation. As I mentioned earlier, Aria always has an exit strategy. It’s a coping mechanism for her, healthy and unhealthy. Everyone believes she’s dead, including her family who now are calling for my arrest and full prosecution for murder despite there being no body. 

They don’t get that I know better I find little signs no one else would notice but us two and only we can understand. Small little chalk drawings of inside jokes we shared over the years every few weeks. A ladybug in a top hat winking on my commute to work, a koala grabbing onto someone’s arm on the sidewalk outside of my place a few houses down, the lyrics to random songs we laughed about. So inconspicuous and nothing direct but specific enough I know for a fact it’s her, she is watching, and she is enjoying every second I squirm. She is clearly enjoying the leaving the little signs to let me know she’s around. Aria is watching me possibly go to prison for life for her murder, while she is alive and well still torturing me.

 I have no idea what she plans to do, or how she sees this playing out. What I do know is I should have accepted happy 50-75% of the time because now I am never happy, just constantly worried looking over my shoulder.

So, for one final time I ask what I ever did to her?!
