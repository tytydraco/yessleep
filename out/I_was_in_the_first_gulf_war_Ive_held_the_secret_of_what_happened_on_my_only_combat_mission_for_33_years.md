I was deployed with the Royal Marine Commandos during the gulf war. I’ll never forget my only combat mission.

Who am I? Well I could tell you the truth, but then you’d probably never get to read this story and I’d be dead within a week. So for now you can call me Corporal dexter. I’ll also be changing the names of the rest of my squad and anyone else to protect them as well. 

I joined Her Majesty’s Navy in 1987 at the tender age of 18. From the beginning I knew exactly where I wanted to be. The Royal Marine commandos. The elite force of the best the Royal Navy had to offer.

 I passed all the pre-selection tests and interviews without much fuss. The PRMC selection course also went fairly well. Then onto the 32 weeks of actual training. It had its ups and downs and I did doubt myself at times. But I managed to finish out somewhere in the middle of my class.

 From there I was stationed for about a year in Belfast “keeping the peace”, as they say. That year felt like an eternity for me and the boys in my unit. Car bombings, snipers, ambushes, we were almost cheerful when we got back to the barracks one cool evening to find that there was dust up half the world away from Ireland.

 The British Government agreed to join the yanks in their little crusade against the man with the beret and the stache. And we were about to go play soldier in the big sandbox.

We got the call about an hour later to pack all our kit and be ready to catch a flight to Saudi Arabia the next morning. I slept most of the way, but did manage to wake up in time to see the sun rise over the deserts of Arabia. Like most kids I grew up with tales of this land, and the riches, adventures, and terrors it had to offer. And I had a feeling I’d get to experience all three before the end of this excursion for Queen and Country. 

As the airbase the coalition forces were using came into view over the horizon. Some Bloke cranked the volume to that old song “horse with no name” by America. Through the stereo in the Land Rover they stuffed in the cargo plane with us. We all had a chuckle and complimented the young private for his timing. 

Right as the landing gear touched down shaking the cabin of the massive C130. jarring us all back to reality.

 We collected all our kit and started to file out of the back of the aircraft, and into lorries that would take us to our assigned barracks.

As I neared the rear door; one of the boys from my unit. We’ll call him Harris. Spoke up. “So do you fancy yourself part of the next desert rats? Or perhaps Lawrence of Arabia?” I laughed once to myself and then turned to him. “I fancy myself coming home alive Harris” 

Harris: “Oh come on now, where’s your sense of adventure?”

“It’s still there Harris. I just want to live to tell the stories myself.” I laughed and grinned back at him.

Harris was a young, conventionally handsome guy with brown hair. Average height, brown hair, the kind of guy you’d see on ads promoting the Royal Navy.

 We took our seats in the back of the Lorries and took off towards the rows of freshly built barracks. The lorry pulled up along the front of one of the barracks and went down the row stopping at each building as names were called. two or three men got off at each building.

“Just like the school bus back home,” Harris muttered to me. “Except these bags weigh less than the ones we carried back then” I replied. Harris laughed in agreement.
 
Soon Harris and I were called and we hopped out of the back of the Lorry in front of the sun baked and sand covered barracks. “And here we are,” I say to Harris as we head up to the front door.
 
I opened the door to see 4 other men bearing the royal Marines patch on their shoulders unpacking.

 “You boys with Arrow Squad?” I asked as they all turned to me and nodded in the affirmative. Arrow squad was the call sign they gave to us when we were called up to join the operation in the Middle East. Only Harris and I were kept together from our old unit in Belfast. 

“I guess we should introduce ourselves then.” The tall and muscular red headed man standing to my right said.
 
“I’m sergeant Royce. I’ve been assigned to be squad leader.” 

Next the thinner guy and shorter man with satin black hair in the back spoke up. 

“I’m corporal mills. Sharpshooter.” 

He turned away again. Then the markedly younger, blonde lad chimed in. 

“Im private lang. I’ll be handling the comms for the squad. This is also my first deployment.” (As if we all couldn’t tell) “but I’m glad it’s with you guys” 

he added, before turning with us to look toward the last of the men in the barracks. A short but stocky gent, lifting weights shirtless on his cot.

 “The name’s lee. Support Gunner. So I’ll be the one covering your asses for the next 6 months.” 

He had a large scar just above his right shoulder blade. He had been in the shit.

Then the room all turned to us as I gave the introduction for both Harris and myself. 

“I’m Corporal dexter. I’ll be second in command to the sergeant, as well as acting as grenadier for the squad. And this here is Lance Corporal Harris. He’ll be handling all things mechanical for the unit, as well as being the designated comedian.”

“Oh that’ll be real helpful in a gunfight” Lee quipped. 

“Hey now Lee, we could all use a bit of humor here.” Royce added. 

We got settled in and enjoyed our first, and only quiet evening in Arabia till lights out at 10 pm. Harris thought it would be hilarious to loosen some screws on Lee's cot while he was at supper.

5 out of the 6 men in the squad did enjoy the prank as Lee went rolling into the floor after his only bed crumpled like cardboard under him. The 6th man in the squad though was not as amused, and immediately Identified Harris as the culprit. Lee picked up his entrenching tool and chased Harris clean out of the barracks and forced him to climb a telephone pole to escape the wrath of the angry support gunner.

The next couple weeks consisted of a steady regiment of PT training and squad tactics as we worked up to be ready for deployment when it all kicked off. We were really getting it together to my surprise.

Royce can really think on his feet and has a knack for improvisation. 

Lang can stay cool and deliver clear remarks into the radio even under the stress of explosions, enemy fire, and Harris and Lee cursing at each other at the top of their lungs. 

Mills can take the helmet off a mannequin target at 100 meters with nothing but an iron sighted SA80.

And Lee can send a stream of lead flying into an area as small or large as you like. 

Of course me and Harris haven’t gotten rusty at all. 

I perforated the turret or every scrap tank on the AT weapons range. 

And Harris has kept all our weapons and equipment tip-top shape as well as rigging us up a homemade FM radio so we can listen in on the Top 40 countdown the yanks got to listen to on the other side of the base.

On the last day of training before orders came down to us something truly shocking happened. It was during a live fire exercise in the kill house.

 (a maze filled with targets laid out like the interior of a building to simulate CQB scenarios)

We had breached the “front door” the building and cleared the first room together. (4 hostile targets down) and were clearing rooms one after the other down a long straight hallway. 

(Now to emphasize how important the speed is at which you engage a target. some of the targets had been rigged up with paintball guns. They would activate and fire back at you via remote control if the officers in charge of that training session felt you weren’t quick enough on the draw.)

We cleared the first 3 out of out of 5 rooms in the hallway without a problem. However Harris and Lee felt it was a fine time to start their daily squabble as we were getting ready to breach room number 4. 

Harris: “just stay behind me darling daddy’s got this handled”

Lee: “why don’t you go fuck yourself pretty boy and let the men take care of his” 

Royce snapped around furious “you two knock it the fuck off!” He said in the most aggressive whisper you could imagine.

The two went quiet again but the gauntlet had been thrown down on who was the better soldier in close quarters combat. So far Harris had eliminated 3 targets to Lee’s 1.

Royce kicked in the door and charged in. The proper way to enter the room is to funnel single file and as quickly as possible to cover your sector of the room. 

Well Lee and Harris were not going to each other get any bit ahead of the other so they came in at the exact same time and “three stooges” themselves into the door frame causing them both to stumble through the door and miss their sectors that me and Lang had to cover as well as our own.

A voice echoed on the intercom “arrow squad you fumbled that breach and failed to follow proper range safety. One more mistake like that and I will inform your commander.”

Harris and Lee shot curses at each other under their breath as we regrouped and got ready for the final breach in this hall. Same procedure as last time. Harris and Lee were to be the 3rd and 4th men through the door behind me and Royce.

 “Breaching, breaching, breaching!!!” 

I kicked in the door and went in dropping 2 static targets and one paintball target before it could get a shot off. Royce knocked out 2 on the left and Lee laid down a fuselade to take out the last 3 in the right corner. Lang, mills, and Harris had no targets in their sectors. Royce, lang, mills, and I had filed back out of the room when it happened….

“Now that’s how it’s done.” Smirked Lee at Harris. 

Harris let his inner prick out for a moment “yeah is that what you told your last squad before they got shot up?”

Without a word Lee suddenly charged Harris after he had turned to leave the room and shoved him to the ground so hard he slid at least 10 feet across the concrete floor”

Harris rolled over as soon as he realized what happened and saw Lee towering over him. Just as he was about to leap back to his feet and go after Lee 3 splashes of orange mist erupted from Lee’s left shoulder, side, and hip. Harris paused and turned his head to see hidden in the shadows of a closet was a paintball target. 

“Don’t just lay their fucking shoot it you daft!” Lee yelled as Harris rolled onto his right side and double tapped the target.

We all ran back in to find the scene as the intercom echoed again “arrow squad. You cleared the building but suffered a KIA. You fail this exercise but because of the circumstances I’ve observed I’m not recommending any disciplinary actions.

“I-I’m sorry.” Harris said looking at the floor as he was getting to his feet. 

“Mm” Lee grumbled as he left to go change out of his now-stained uniform.

“I fucked up now didn’t I dex?” He asked as he dusted himself off.

“No more than usual. You two are gonna have to knock this shit off though or we’re gonna end up cleaning toilets for the next 6 months and never do our actual jobs again.”

“You think he likes twinkies?”

“What the fuck are you talking about Jimmy?”

“A peace offering. I’ll fix his bed and give him the last box of twinkies I lifted off that news crew when they were interviewing the commander.”

“That plan is ridiculous but so are you Jimmy”

“Too right mate. Too right.”

It turns out Lee did like twinkies and actually laughed at one of Harris’s jokes while sitting on his now secure, and freshly made cot. 

These parts are especially hard for me to write. As you can see we were bonded as a team and friends.

It was an extremely hot Monday morning when we got the call to be ready for deployment within 24 hrs. We thought the whole force was about to deploy and the liberation of Kuwait was about to begin. We spent all morning prepping and organizing our gear as well as getting into the necessary headspace for real combat. There’s always a possibility that one, a few, or all of us wouldn’t make it back but we were ready to do our damnedest to prevent that.

At about 1400 hrs we were called to meet with our commander for our first real mission brief. A lieutenant fresh out of training picked us up in a Land Rover and drove us across the base to an airplane hangar that was used at this time as a warehouse for equipment and weapons. 

We were ushered by the lieutenant through the building to a room near the rear where two officers were waiting to give us our briefing and outline what our mission and duties will be here in-country. 

We had been selected to join the force to hunt down, and destroy, the chemical weapons Saddam had used on the Kurds back in 88’ and was rumored to be preparing to use on the coalition forces in the event of an invasion of kuwait. 

We took our seats and the officer standing in the shadow of a projector stepped forward in front of us. A tall thin man with greyed hair and a thick, well manicured moustache. “Gentlemen. My name is Colonel starkey. You’ve been gathered here based on your exceptional skill sets to carry out a task of the utmost importance. The first slide please captain.” 

The colonel nodded to the young officer standing behind the projector. In that moment the projector screen transitioned from a blank white screen to a satellite image of a well fortified bunker standing alone in the barren desert. “This is the target of your mission. Satellite imaging located this bunker in the southern deserts of Iraq approximately 20 miles from the Kuwaiti border. Next slide please” 

the projector then switched to a photo taken from the same angle but after dark showing trucks being unloaded into the large blast doors of the bunker. “We have significant intelligence leading us to believe these crates being unloaded are in fact chemical munitions transported here for quick deployment in the event of the coalition invasion. The next slide please captain welsh.”
 
The screen switched to a profile picture of an Iraqi officer. “This is general Amir soleman of the Iraqi Republican guard. He has been known to be a key figure in the Iraqi chemical weapons program since the beginning. We also have good reason to believe he is on sight at this facility currently. So now you know the facts. On to the plan gentleman. The final slide please.”

 The officer brought up the final slide showing again a Birds Eye view of the bunker and the surroundings but now from a much wider angle showing the desert and some ancient ruins that surround the bunker. Colonel Starkey then drew a collapsible rod from his pocket and extended it before beginning to trace it along the slide. “You’ll be inserted here, approximately 3 kilometers south of the bunker via helicopter. From there you’ll proceed on foot to the target. 

Once reaching the target you are authorized to make your way inside by any means necessary. Once there you are to locate and destroy any chemical munitions you find, and conventional munitions as well if you find it convenient. You are also to locate and eliminate general soleman with extreme prejudice. 

Finally, you are to gather any intelligence you can find especially if it is found on, or near, general soleman. Once your mission is completed you may radio command back here at hq using the code word archangel. A chopper will return to the location of your insertion to pick you back up”

 the colonel took the rod and began to collapse it again in his hands. “Now, any questions?” Royce raised his hand and chimed in. 

“Sir, What is the contingency plan in case the chemical weapons or the general aren’t on site?”

The colonel smirked and replied “then you are to eliminate all Republican guard on site and destroy any valuable materials and equipment. Any intelligence you find is also to be secured and extracted with you at all cost.” 

Royce shook his head in the affirmative. “Yes sir.” After Royce finished, I had a question of my own.

 “sir?” I raised my hand. “What weapons and equipment are we authorized for this operation?”

 The colonel nodded. “Right. You and your team are authorized to gather any weapons and equipment you deem necessary from the armory in this hangar. Be advised though this operation is just one of many being carried out at the moment so it is first come first serve.” 

“Yes sir.” I replied. 

“Now hop to it men. Our timetable is as limited as my own.” 

We all got up and filed out to the armory. When we got there we were somewhat underwhelmed by our selection. Thankfully there was plenty of “CRBN” equipment and the related first aid for chemical weapon exposure.

 However, for weapons we had a much more limited selection. The SAS had evidently gotten here before us because all the non standard weapons like M16’s and MP5’s had been taken along with all the suppressors. Leaving only the standard SA80’s and an L86 LSW which Lee snatched up along with a considerable amount of ammunition. We all grabbed a browning hi power and holster off the rack as well.

I, being the designated grenadier, grabbed as many rifle grenades as I could carry and stuffed them in my pack. 

The C4 used for demolition was split up between the team in case someone got hit. We each got one charge a piece to blow the chemical weapons and anything else that would need a quick and thorough removal. 

We got completely suited up and filed out of the barracks towards the waiting helicopter. The rotor splash stirring up a torrent of sand all around the landing pad causing us to squint.

We lifted off right at sunset headed towards the border. As I sat in the open door, staring out at the dark orange setting sun casting shadows over the sea of sand. I started to get an eerie feeling. Not just the pre mission jitters to be expected though. It was more like that feeling of dread you get as a kid, when you’re forced to walk down a dark hallway to get to the light switch at the other end. That there’s something out there in the desert tonight more dangerous than chemical weapons or elite republican guard. I put those thoughts to the back of my mind though for the sake of my mates.

About an hour later we had reached the LZ under the cover of darkness. The chopper sat down and let us off. We left the helicopter and fanned out in all directions to secure the LZ and make sure there were no scouting parties that could give away our presence.

“LZ clear.” I said over the radio, letting the pilot know he’s good to lift back off. 

“Alright boys, let's get moving.” Royce said, taking the lead. 

We then headed out following the compass directions given to us back at base. 

We walked single file, each of us covering a section of the landscape, scanning the horizon for threats. 

“This is already getting old.” Harris quipped about 15 minutes into the trek. 

“Better get used to it. this desert is our sandbox for next year.” I shot back. 

“You getting the feeling we’re strolling into the lions teeth?” Harris asked more seriously. 

“Honestly, yeah. But we’re marine commandos. It’s what we do Jimmy.” I cracked a smile at him to lighten the mood. 

“Too right mate” he chuckled back.

That dreadful feeling hit me again as I watched the Commando Sea King helicopter disappear again over the horizon. Accompanied by the feeling of being watched. Not like by enemy scouts or snipers. By something primal, supernatural. 

They say some people can sense when a spirit or ghost is in the room with them. Well I never personally believed that. But that’s the only way I could describe that particular feeling.

We walked for about 45 minutes over a terrain of ridges and sand dunes until we reached the outside perimeter of the bunker. We knew we were close by the small piles of rubble and half collapsed walls of the ancient village that once stood here.

We zig zagged around the ruins as we walked and I started to notice there were a lot of writings on the walls that weren’t in modern Arabic. Probably from close to the time that these buildings were first built. The ink they used was a deep red like scarlet but aged for a dozen centuries. 

I passed close to one of the particularly tall walls still standing and as I did the writing on the wall had a faint coppery smell. “Surely not?” I thought to myself. But then again it wasn’t uncommon for people to use animal blood as a form of spiritual protection back in those days. The book of exodus for example.

If it were blood though it would have to be hundreds of years old at least. There’s no way it would still be this intact. Let alone still have that distinctive metallic odor.

After we had passed the outer ring of ruins we came up to the bottom of a ridge that according to the satellite photos, was the last crest before the bunker compound itself came into view. Royce threw up his fist to signal us to hold up. Then he opened his hand and dropped it to his side, holding his hand flat. letting us know to go prone and begin crawling up the ridge.

My laptop battery is getting low. And I don’t trust staying in one place too long while trying to write this story. You never know who is looking over your shoulder.


I’ll be back soon to continue. Unless of course I end up with a head full of lead.
