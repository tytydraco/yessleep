I’m being hunted, and I need someone's help.

If I don't get out of this fucking town by midnight, he's coming for me– and this bastard is going to fucking kill me. 

I don't know what he is/was/is becoming. I'm so out of my depth right now. 

Look, before I start, I want to let you know my ability has nothing to do with the person hunting me down. I just want to clarify. 

Yes, this phenomenon *is* part of what is happening to me. 

But it’s *not* why I'm scared for my life. 

All you need to know is that it developed around puberty. 

Since I was about twelve years old, I have been able to ‘jump’ into people's bodies. 

It's not permanent and there are limitations, so it's not an ability at all. 

It's more of a nuisance. 

This phenomenon happens during prolonged skin-to-skin contact. 

I can hug someone without anything happening, but if the hug lasts a certain amount of time—or a handshake, for example, a kiss, or any kind of intimacy—that's the trigger. 

When it first happened, I was shaking my middle school principal’s hand. 

If I could describe it, it feels like drowning, like being stuck, suffocating, before coming up for air; and this time, I was staring at *myself*. 

I remember my vision was blurry and feathered, and for some reason, I think I was slightly tipped to the side. 

I thought it was an out of body experience, but then it happened again. 

The next time was with my mom, when she was hugging me. This time, it lasted longer, and I could actually *feel* myself in my mother’s body. I could wiggle her fingers, and look down at her hands. 

I think I can speak for any kid with this kind of Freaky Friday crap happening to them. 

I took advantage of it, duh. 

I tested my limitations (exactly four minutes and three seconds) was my durability in someone's body, before I was violently yanked back to my own. 

Think of it like elastic. 

If I pulled too far, I would bounce back. Children were easier to jump into. 

Parents were harder to establish myself inside, but my own age was easy. 

I tried my friends and started to build my durability. 

By age 15, I could last fifteen minutes and thirteen seconds inside an adult body. 

Twenty minutes and eight seconds inside a child. 

Babies were a no-go. I tried to jump into my neighbors newborn daughter, and was immediately flung back.

In my teens, I built up my endurance. 

I was eighteen, starting college, when I ran into another limitation. 

I don't know if it's always been like this, or if this thing changes and mutates like a virus. 

During my first week at college, I tried to jump into my roommate to check out her schedule. 

So, I hugged her. 

Just a simple hug, which triggered the jump. 

Confusing, yes, and the symptoms post-jumping are a pain in the ass. 

In her body, I went through her backpack, and I was careful to count under my breath. 

If I'm in a body for too long, they will start to bleed from the nose. 

I think it's something to do with pressure on the brain, but I'm not sure. 

I haven't explained what happens to my own body during a jump– and truthfully? I don't actually really know?? 

I don't know if consciousness is swapped between bodies, or gets pushed back inside the brain. 

What I do know, is my own body goes into a sort of stasis. 

Okay, still with me? Good. Let's talk about Rowan. 

Rowan was always kind of fucking weird. But he wasn’t always like this. 

Ever since he moved out of his frat house, it’s like he’s become a different person. 

I’ve known him—well, known of him—since freshman year. He was that pretentious know-it-all in my philosophy classes, always acting like he had the universe figured out. 

Trench coat, hands shoved in his pockets, a permanent smirk on his lips. 

He looked like a twentieth-century detective with a stick up his ass. 

The most insufferable guy on campus. He debated everyone, never admitting when he was wrong, insisting *his* opinion was concrete, while everyone else was a *fucking moron* for not watching old black and white noir movies. 

Even when Rowan was wrong, when someone *proved* he was wrong, dangling the evidence in his face, citing real sources, he’d still double down, leaning back in his chair, heeled shoes resting on his desk. 

“I literally have no idea what the fuck you're talking about, dude.” he'd say, when someone brought up a valid point. 

With a curl on his lip and a triumphant glint in his eye, he'd remind them that he was top of his class in everything at school and his ADHD just made him smarter, better wired, a *true intellectual*.

a nihilist riddled with his own existential dread.

“Because nothing comes after death”, he argued.

Over the years, he just got worse.

Even as a twenty two year old, he still acted like his obnoxious teenage self. 

“There is nothing, and there will never be anything.” Rowan said loudly. 

“Religion is a playground created by old people who were fucking bored. I’m going to die. You're going to die. We’re all going to die.”

He raised his voice, intentionally cutting off the girl trying to argue *for*  life after death.

“We are all going to be consumed by nothing, end in nothing, and never think again. We won’t even be conscious enough to know we’re not thinking! Which is fucking crazy, right?”

His lips spread into a grin. “We live up to one hundred years, and how does it end, huh? It ends in fucking *nothing*.”

Rowan turned his gaze towards us, eyes narrowed, challenging us to correct him. 

"Wealthy or poor, we all end up six feet under the ground. We rot, and our memories rot with us until even the slightest speck of our existence—our names rarely whispered, our photos ingrained in reality—fade too."

"The human race has come so far in evolution, so far in bettering ourselves, yet not even we can stop the creeping inevitability of our own demise.”

He laughed, but his voice was shaking, his teeth gritted together, breath coming out in sharp pants—like he was both reveling in and terrified of his conclusion. 

“We just… end. And who says there’s even an ending or a beginning? How can we be sure we’re even real? 

This guy just went on and on. 

Like:

"Because what’s the point? Life, then death, then darkness. Forever. That’s what we’re subjected to from birth—the inevitable reality that one day, we will cease to… exist.”

Something twitched in his expression at that word.

Forever.

It was almost like he was giving in, his muscles relaxing as he exhaled a shaky breath. “Oblivion,” he continued, projecting his voice. 

“Oblivion never stops. It never falters. It cannot be fought or reasoned with. It is a disease that keeps going, spreading, expanding, eating away across the universe until there is nothing—and everyone in this room will become nothing.”

Again, his lip curled, fists tightening. He was scared. Rowan was scared of his own hypothesis—that dying meant ceasing to exist.

And one day, he too would fall prey to that oblivion.

“Rowan.”

Professor F enjoyed the debate initially, but after almost two hours of Rowan’s obnoxious ranting, even he was starting to sink into his chair, twirling a pen between his fingers. “Maybe chill out a little, huh.”

“I'm *speaking*, professor,” Rowan spoke calmly, and to my surprise, the professor nodded, gesturing for the boy to continue.

“Go ahead.”

“You're wrong.” Clary, a petite brunette, spoke up. 

Rowan’s head snapped around, lips curling into a smirk, or maybe he was hopeful. 

“Oh?”

Instead of resuming his rant from his chair, Rowan jumped to his feet, and in three strides, he was looming over his opponents desk. Clary. Who just wanted to take part in the discussion. 

I could tell by her face, wide frantic eyes and wobbling lips she was regretting her decision to raise her hand to debate him. 

Anyone who did ended up in tears, or leaving class. 

Clarissa politely argued that there was a lot of scientific evidence of life after death. 

“Oh, yeah? Like what?” he demanded in a scoff. 

Clarissa, raising her voice over his, spoke timidly, her eyes glued to her workbooks.

“Well, there's, umm—”

I watched him, like a predator, lean over the girl’s desk. 

“There's *what*?”

Clary ducked her head, refusing to look him in the eye. 

“Clarissa, you're not *looking* at me," Rowan murmured in a sing-song, his tone a carefully constructed facade—smooth, almost gentle, designed to unravel the knot in her gut. The use of her full name was just another manipulation tactic. 

He leaned closer, hands curled into fists, resting on her desk. Rowan’s presence alone made it difficult to talk back to him. 

He towered over her at an impressive six-foot-something, dark brown curls pushed back by a pair of Ray-Bans that never left the crown of his head, a single lone curl hanging in challenging eyes. 

Rowan knew he was attractive. 

He knew his looks alone could swing everyone's opinions *his* way.

When Clary slowly lifted her head, meeting his gaze, his frown softened into a smile. 

Triumph. 

“Are you religious, Clarissa?” he asked in a friendly tone, dragging a chair in front of her desk and plonking himself down on it, resting his chin on his fist. 

I could sense a collective breath being held across the room.

“I am.” she said. “I believe in reincarnation.”

“Rebirth.” Rowan nodded, his smile was patronizing. “Okay, so let's say I pull out a gun right now and shoot you in the face.”

“Rowan.” Our professor warned.

He groaned, throwing his hands up with an eye roll. 

“Okay, *fiiiiiine*. Let's say I hy-po-thetic-ally drop dead right now from a peanut allergy.” 

Rowan was enjoying the girl’s discomfort, the way she tried to lean back. 

His grin was spiteful, brow raised, challenging her to throw a rebuttal. “What will happen to me after I die, Clarissa?”

Clary straightened up in her seat, her cheeks turning pink. 

“You would be reincarnated.” she said. 

“No, *before* that,” Rowan snapped, his lips curling. 

“Yes, I get reincarnated, but is that straight away? How do you know it's not years, centuries, light years before I am reincarnated? And what happens in the time between, hmm?”

He leaned closer, so close that the girl was visibly shaking. 

His voice dropped into an almost seductive murmur, his wild eyes begging for her answer. “Tell me oblivion doesn't exist between me dying and my rebirth.”

“Oh, *please*,” another voice joined in from the back of the class. 

Her voice was like wind-chimes, immediately attracting eyes. 

Including Rowan’s. The girl had an eccentric sense of style, a multicolored knitted jacket over a pair of overalls, blonde curls piled into a messy top bun. 

She grinned at Rowan, her pen lodged between her teeth. 

“Sweetie, it's *clear* you're scared of death, and you're just looking for someone to tell you otherwise. You're full of BS. You're not some genius intellectual. You're desperate for answers.”

Rowan’s lips pricked. “I'm sorry, I can't remember your name, but I don't care."

“Imogen.” she said, introducing herself. “I've been sitting here for half a semester.”

Rowan’s eyes narrowed. “So, you're a stalker.”

“I’m just a good listener.”

Rowan sat back on his chair. “Go ahead! I'm sure the whole class is curious.” 

He gestured to himself. 

“I mean *I'm* curious to know why you think I'm full of bullshit.”

“You're scared of death,” Imogen repeated. 

“That's why you just spent over an hour ranting about the impossibility of life after death—you’re trying to convince yourself against your own belief. Because deep down, you’re terrified of what you believe in.” She pulled the pen from her mouth with a pop. “Oblivion.”

Rowan’s lips pricked into a small smile. Somehow, his expression relaxed.

“Was it that obvious?”

The girl shrugged, now in full control of the debate. “You were practically foaming at the mouth, so yes, it was obvious." 

Her smile was friendly. “If I might ask, why are you so obsessed with death?”

“I don't want to die,” he deadpanned.

“Okay, but why?” She leaned forward, her lips curling into a challenging smile.

“Just like you said, we all die. Dying is natural. It's part of life. So, why are you so scared?”

It was as if she were tearing down the impenetrable walls he’d built around himself. For once, Rowan was speechless. 

He tapped his foot against the floor, his expression softening. 

He wasn't used to being challenged, and that was evident in his body language; the sweat glistening on his brow, his fingers clenching and unclenching into a fist. 

“Because… oblivion is endless,” he said, tripping over his words. “And I don't want to be stuck inside it. I don't want to lose my self-awareness, my ability to think and realize.”

“But that's just peace,” Imogen said, inclining her head. “You’re just describing dying. Why do you want to be aware when you're dead?”

“Because I do,” he snapped.

“Okay, but why?” she challenged him, clearly enjoying the attention.

“Why do you keep asking why?” Rowan demanded.

“Imogen.” Professor F spoke up. “That's enough. I think we’re done here today.”

“You keep saying you're scared of dying, scared of losing your self-awareness,” 

Imogen continued, raising her voice. 

“So what, do you want to be constantly aware of being inside an endless void of nothing? Do you really want to be awake?”

“That's not what I said,” Rowan gritted out.

She nodded. “Sounds like you did.” Imogen shot him a grin.

“In the words of the great Hansen: in a mmmbop, you’re gone. You can't stop it. So why be scared?”

Rowan's lips twitched into the smallest of smiles. “I never said I wanted to stop it.”

Imogen cocked her head. “Do you believe in the supernatural?”

Her words slid into me like ice cold needles. 

Rowan scoffed. “What, like, fucking vampires and shit? Obviously not.”

“But you *do* want to believe in self awareness after death,” she said, “Which, arguably, could be seen as supernatural.”

Rowan let out an incredulous laugh. “You're… you're twisting my words! That's not what I said.”

“So prove it.”

“What?!”

“Prove to me you're right.”

“About *what*?!”

“I said, that's enough,” Professor F said sharply. “If you want to debate in your own time, that's your choice. Sit down, both of you.”

I hadn’t even realized Imogen had stood up, her arms crossed, wearing a smug smile.

To everyone's surprise, though, Rowan was smiling too.

That was the start of a beautiful (and increasingly curious) friendship. 

Let me explain. 

Initially, the two were just friends. 

They hung out in class. 

Imogen moved seats to sit next to him, and I saw them on campus getting coffee, or just chilling out. 

Rowan was always talking (going on and on and on) and Imogen was either sunbathing next to him, while he sat with his knees to his chest, or her head of curls buried in her arms. 

Sometimes, she would rest her head on his shoulder. 

I expected him to shove her away, but he didn't. 
 
The two looked comfortable together. 

Imogen had a significant effect on him, turning him from an egotistical asshole to a more tolerable, quieter, version of himself. 

Rowan was a very obvious pick-me boy. 

He joined a frat house, despite their cruel hazing rituals.

Rowan struck me as someone who was terrified of being alone, so he was insistent on finding others. 

I admit, I was kind of obsessed with this guy. 

I watched his hazing ritual from afar, comfortably hidden under the turnstiles. 

Twelve guys stood in the rain in their boxers, balancing on one leg, led by their frat leader, a guy towering over them. 

They were mocked and laughed at, told to roll around in the dirt and confess their darkest secrets. 

This was like, literal torture. 

Eleven of them gave up. But Rowan stayed, trembling, holding himself up for hours, as the day went on.

At first, he had an audience, and he seemed to revel in it. 

But one by one, they drifted away, ducking out of the downpour. 

When the last student was gone, it was just him—standing there, shivering under a sky that grew ever darker. When the rain came down harder, I started to see the cracks form in his expression. 

He swayed to the left, then the right, forcing himself to stay upright. 

I gave up and ran to him, ready to offer my jacket.

But he just leered at me, wet strands of hair plastered to his face. “Do you have any water?” he asked through clenched teeth.

When I shook my head, he snorted and looked away.

“Well, get the fuck away from me. I'm not a zoo attraction.”

So I did.

As I ran for shelter, though, Rowan was already tearing into someone else. 

I glanced back, curious. This time, it was a guy trying to drape a bright yellow sweatshirt over Rowan’s shoulders. 

Rowan shoved it off with a scowl. “I don't want your corny fucking sweater, dude.”

“But you're cold.” The guy’s voice was smooth like chocolate. I recognized it. 

I didn't know his name, but I knew of him. 

There was a rumor that his parents were in the mafia. 

I only knew his voice from him standing up in the middle of the class, and denouncing the rumors, never once losing his cool. 

He readjusted the sweater when Rowan shrugged it off with a grumble. 

“You're going to catch something.”

“And?” Rowan, very quickly losing his concentration, started stumbling on one leg. “Hey, you're going to make me fall!”

The guy stepped forward, and stabled Rowan’s shoulders. 

“Better?”

Rowan folded his arms. “Maybe.”

Through the downpour, I caught only flashes of the guy, dark blonde curls nestled under his hood. 

When he stepped back, sweater still in hand, Rowan groaned.

“Okay, fine. Leave the sweater, if you *insist*.” he paused. “Thanks.”

“Rowan!”

Behind me, a familiar blur of blonde curls peeked out from under an umbrella, balancing two styrofoam cups.

Imogen.

Like a disappointed parent, she marched over to him.

“What did I say?”

Still stubbornly balancing on one leg, Rowan scowled. “Come off it, Imogen. You’re not my mom.”

“Fine! I’ll just take these coffees and drink them myself.”

When she pivoted on her heel to leave, Rowan sighed.

“Thanks for the coffee.”

Imogen turned, her scowl morphing into a grin. She handed him the coffee, and he took it gratefully, hopping to keep balance. 

“You're an idiot.”

“I’m too cold to argue.”

“Agreed,” the blond guy joined in with a chuckle. He tugged his hood over his eyes, shoved his hands into his pockets, and nodded to Imogen. “I’ll see you back at the house?”

Imogen nodded. “Yep! I’ll buy groceries tonight. Oh! I cleaned the kitchen, so don’t get your grubby shoes on my pristine floor.”

The guy stepped back, offering them a two-fingered salute.

“Sure. I'll start cooking dinner when I get back.”

Rowan stumbled, hopping on one leg. “Wait, you two know each other?”

“Well, yeah.” Imogen shoved him with a grin. “Kaz is my roommate. Idiot.”

“Charlie.” The guy corrected, shooting Rowan a smile. “But everyone calls me Kaz.”

Oh, it was stoner Charlie.

I *did* know him. I asked him out as a… joke… and he started, like, uncontrollably laughing. 

That was where I left the three of them, already soaked through to the bone. 

But in the days that followed, it became clear that Rowan and Charlie were getting closer. 

I saw them walking to class together, Imogen squeezed between them, and then later, at a party. You're probably calling me a stalker, but I need you to understand—what happened between these three strangers was insane. 

And the more I discovered, the more intrigued I became. I was firmly convinced that Charlie was ‘adopting’ outsiders, and converting them into his roommates.

Charlie owned one of the most expensive houses in this city. 

The Bolivia residence; the last remaining elder house in town. 

Also, an antique goldmine. 

As someone who's poor, and definitely uses my ability to scam people, this detail stood out. 

I overheard a group of girls talking about Imogen. 

The rumor was that she had "slept with half of the freshman class" and swiftly became an outsider before moving in with Charlie.

So, this guy had taken Imogen under his wing. 

Now Rowan? 

I shouldn't have cared. But beyond the fortune sitting in that house, those three students became impossible to ignore. 

Whoever Charlie was, his influence was slowly bleeding into Rowan and Imogen. 

It's like they went from normal college kids, to something else entirely. 

It started innocently enough. Rowan, now fully tamed and more of a pretentious know-it-all than ever, began drawing stares the moment he entered a room. 

I couldn't explain why. 

It was like he carried an aura, an unearthly glow that demanded attention. Charlie and Imogen kept their heads down, buried under layers of clothing and hoods, but Rowan wanted to be noticed, despite his permanent scowl. 

Something about him had changed, though I couldn’t quite put my finger on it.

Everything, his posture, the way he held himself, his expression, even his voice, was different. 

His tone had softened into a smooth murmur, dripping with contempt and amusement, a far cry from defensive hissing.

He ditched the 1920s-style threads for band shirts and jeans, finally wearing his Ray-Bans instead of using them to slick back his hair.

Once a well-known frat boy, Rowan started ignoring his old friends, sticking to Charlie's side. 

But what really stuck out about the Bolivia House residents, was that they were *pale*. 

Not just pale. Under bright lights, the three were practically translucent. 

Charlie’s face was thinner, gaunt, even, while Imogen’s cheeks had lost their glow, her eyes sunken and drained of color. 

They were beautiful but almost grotesque, like freshly embalmed corpses.

If I could describe them in a way that you would understand, imagine a fading photograph. 

Here's where it starts getting weird.

There are many diseases that could have made them look like plague victims.

I also considered the possibility of mold poisoning or maybe carbon monoxide, since they all lived together.

But then their behavior grew slightly... disturbing.

They looked noticeably less dead, walking into a party, one Friday night. 

Color returned to their cheeks, their eyes were no longer sunken. They looked fantastic.

I watched them from my seat on someone’s Craigslist couch, intrigued by their increasingly erratic behavior.

Rowan went straight into the kitchen, pulling all the blinds shut.

Very *normal* behavior...

I thought that was off, but it didn't bother me at that moment.

Imogen became insanely talkative, jumping into a random guy’s lap.

But it was Charlie I was worried about.

I was hunting down food to combat the nausea twisting in my gut when I walked straight into him raiding the refrigerator. 

I could already see his blonde curls, and for once, Rowan wasn't clinging to his side. 

At first, I thought he was scarfing down cold pizza slices, until I caught sight of his twitching hands curled around a pack of raw bacon. Strands of fat slithered between his teeth. I didn’t question him. 

I mean, I couldn't question him. Every time I tried, he just grunted. This was a very different Charlie from what I knew. 

He was an intelligent, smooth talker, always in control, always high. 

This guy’s eyes were half-lidded, vacant. 

“Charlie?” I managed to get out in a whisper. 

This would have been the perfect time to take him over. 

I could last twenty minutes in an adult body, and I was gunning for his. 

Not just because of his house, but because of his influence on the other two.

Whoever or *whatever* Charlie was, he was controlling his roommates. 

And I was desperate to know *how*. 

“Charlie!” I hissed again, this time grabbing his shoulders. 

He surprised me with an uncharacteristic yelp, his body jerking, curling into itself,  claw-like fingers digging into the plastic. 

Charlie's head snapped around, wild, unfocused eyes finding mine. 

It was almost *territorial*. 

Like he was afraid I was going to *take* it from him.

“It's okay, never mind,” I managed to get out, well aware of Charlie’s tracking glare, watching my every movement. 

I took a single step back, and his whole body jolted, his nose flaring, lips curling into a snarl. When I made it clear I wasn't a threat, he slowly inclined his head, before turning back to his… snack.

I edged away from him, and walked straight into Rowan, who was mid-conversation with another guy. 

The two were tucked into the hallway, away from the crowd.

The guy had long blonde hair tied into a ponytail, a plaid shirt over jeans. Australian, by the sound of his accent. 

“Rowan, just… please,” the Australian grabbed him, forcing him to look at him. 

“Tell me what's going on, okay? You've been flaking out. You're not answering my texts. Whatever it is, you can tell me.”

Rowan, leaning against the wall with his arms folded, rolled his eyes. He was in yesterday's clothes, I noticed. 

The exact same shirt and jeans. 

He was trying to act nonchalant, but I saw his gaze flick back and forth between each window, like he was scared of something behind it. 

Rowan sighed. “I was sacrificed to a werewolf worshipping cult, and now I crave the taste of human flesh.”

Sam scoffed. “That's not funny.”

Rowan didn't laugh, raising a brow. “I'm sorry, did it say it *was*?”

“Rowan—” 

“I'm fine, Sam.”

“Yeah, but the way you were acting the other night–”

Rowan shoved the guy away with a snort. “All right, well, I'm going to get another drink. Have fun playing detective, Sammy.” 

I followed him into the kitchen, where he made out with a random guy, who seemed surprised but into it—only to shove the guy away when the stranger tried to get closer. 

He grabbed a dancing Imogen’s arm, pulling her to his side. I couldn't register what they were saying, so I moved closer, blending in with the crowd of drunk students. 

“It's almost time,” Rowan said in a sing-song, trying-not-to-panic, but definitely panicking tone. “Where's Kaz?”

Imogen, maintaining a wide smile, tugged him closer, so close that he stumbled, almost losing his footing. 

“I’m pretty sure we drew straws, and *you* picked the short one.”

Rowan dumped his drink down the sink. 

I noticed he never looked up. His gaze stayed glued to the ground, or hidden behind his glasses. 

“I mean, I *was* babysitting, but then he ran off. He's like a fucking cockroach. I think I've cornered him, and then he scuttles from my grasp.”

“Well, we need to find him,” Imogen hissed, diving into the crowd. “You go that way, and uh, I'll check the smoking spot.”

“But what if he's outside?!” Rowan hissed back. 

Imogen was gone, leaving him alone. 

I watched Rowan, clearly panicking, pushing through the crowd of party goers, before he found Charlie standing on the doorstep.

Charlie was stupid still, almost paralyzed, a can of beer still in his hand. 

When it slipped from his grasp and hit the ground, something slimy slithered up my throat. 

Rowan, after stopping dead in his tracks, joined him, his head tipping back, eyes on the sky. 

On a perfect full moon. 

“Oh, fuck,” Imogen shoved past me, shading her eyes. 

She marched toward them, trying to pull them back. But Rowan didn't move. 

Charlie stood perfectly still. 

I watched Imogen’s expression twist with fear, with hopelessness, as she tried and failed to pull the boys back. 

She lifted her head in an attempt to grasp Rowan’s shoulders and yank him back, her resolve was already bleeding away the second her eyes fell on the illuminated sky. 

I swore at that moment, I watched moonlight fill, almost suffocate, her eyes. 

Imogen’s arms dropped to her side, and she joined the other two. 

Just staring at the sky. 

After that night, the Bolivia House kids started to build a reputation for being *weird*. 

I was convinced Charlie was at the center of it all. 

He was the one who was *affected* first, and the other two followed. 

After months of watching three students turn into something *more*, I came to the conclusion: the only way I was going to find answers was to jump into Rowan’s body. 

He was my safest bet. I had a feeling Charlie wasn't human. 

If he wasn't, then surely he would detect me. 

Rowan, however, was a classmate, and easy to perfect the jump. 

I could take his body, go back to his house, take what I needed, and jump back. 

I hadn't seen him in a few weeks, though. 

I figured he was still sick from the gas poisoning on campus. 

It wasn't fatal, but it *did* cause some students to have vivid hallucinations.

“The sun was GONE.” some students claimed, very clearly suffering from poisoning. 

Now, I knew these were just delusions, but my gut still twisted into knots. 

Notably, Rowan and Imogen were fairly normal again. 

They ditched their shades, and no longer had that “aura”. 

I decided to jump into Rowan’s body last night. 

Stupid idea. I know that now. But just keep reading. 

Towards the end of class, I slid into the seat in front of him. 

I tried not to notice the entire class keeping their distance from Rowan– and by that, I mean physically moving their desks away. 

He didn't seem to mind. In fact, Rowan was the quietest he had ever been. 

“Are you free tonight?” I asked, conversationally. 

Rowan lifted his head, settling me with a smile. 

“Sure!” 

No smirk, no amused eyes, not even an eyebrow twitch. 

His smile was so genuine, I thought he was mocking me. 

Class ended, students making themselves scarce. 

I jumped up, only for him to gently pull me back down. 

“How about now?” Rowan’s smile widened, his grip tightening on my wrist. 

I tried to pull away, but he didn't move, his head dropping onto his shoulder. 

“How about we hang out *now*?”

Before I could open my mouth, he wrenched my hand back, until the tendons were snapping, his smile never faltering.

The pain hit me in waves, sending my body into fight or flight. 

“Go ahead.”

Rowan leaned forward, balancing his fist on his chin. 

There was something new in his eyes, a hollowness I couldn't understand, like staring into oblivion itself drowning him, a single ignition of light writhing in his pupils. 

I started to speak— *craaaack*. 

He kept going, his gaze never leaving mine, the pressure of his hand pushing mine further and further and further, until—

I screamed, slamming my free hand over my mouth. 

“I *said* go ahead!” he said cheerfully, tightening his grip.

Like he *knew*. 

The pain was scorching, but already, fading, as I tightened my grip on *him*. 

I've always seen jumping as grabbing onto a person’ soul, and clinging onto it. But with Rowan, there was nothing to grab onto. 

I was aware of his mind, his soul, but it was so *cold*. 

He was so fucking *cold*. 

With others, I was comforted, led by their heartbeat. 

By their breaths. 

But Rowan didn't have a heartbeat. In its place was a cavernous hole where it had  been ripped from him, carving out not just the beating heart, but the soul. 

Inside him, I felt and heard, and sensed echoes of a soul–of that boy who argued and debated until he was red in the face. 

But something had been severed inside him, hollowing him out. 

The man who believed in oblivion, and was living what he wanted to believe. 

Life after death. 

But Rowan’s body felt slimy and… wrong. 

Like the last remnants of him were being puppeteered.

Blood still pumped in his veins without a heart, but it was thicker, coagulating. 

Moving closer to his brain, that's where I was violently shoved *back*. 

But I could already see it. 

Light. 

Bright, polluting light suffocated his thoughts. 

It was inside every memory. 

Every emotion. 

Every feeling. 

It entwined around his very being, the spindly legs of a spider wrapped around his skull. I could feel myself moving towards it, towards beautiful, mesmerizing light, before I found my footing inside him. 

His joints were wrong, twisted and contorted, like he hadn't used them in a while. 

Opening my eyes, I was no longer in my classroom.

I was kneeling on yellow tiles, a kitchen floor, inside Rowan’s body. 

There was no light, only the faded orangeade glow from an outside streetlight. The room was filled with shadows. I glimpsed a cooker tucked into a countertop, a refrigerator in front of me. 

Rowan’s vision was blurred, I could barely focus. 

When I did manage, though, I realized I was staring at a deep dark red ingrained into the refrigerator handle. When I stared down at the floor, I was kneeling in *red*. 

It was old, a rusty color, but plainly blood splatters that tainted each tile. 

Slowly, Rowan's vision was returning, getting brighter. 

I tipped my head back, feeling his bones crack. 

There were symbols on the ceiling, carved by what looked like claws. 

Those same symbols were scratched beneath me, written in bloody, rusty red. 

His body wouldn't move. It was like being stuck inside a *corpse*. 

I reached out, his bones aching, his entire body in constant agony, like it was giving up, and pulled the refrigerator door open. 

The first thing I saw was a long lock of hair. 

I hesitated, sliding the veggie drawer open carefully. The sight of a human head had me shuffling backward. 

Stuffed inside each drawer, bloody chunks of meat were wrapped up and carefully packaged into storage containers. 

There was a whole section for limbs, while others held organs in different containers. Rowan's body didn't scream anymore. His lungs no longer worked. 

He didn't *panic*.

I was wrong about Charlie being the mastermind. 

This guy had killed his fucking roommates.

I couldn't run. 

I couldn't even move. His body was too heavy, weighing me down. 

“I'm sorry, Rowan.”

Something sharp pricked into my –his–neck. 
"I'm sorry. I'm really fucking sorry, but you don't know how dangerous that thing is," the voice hissed. I felt warm arms wrap around his ice-cold body and drag him—me—back, a strip of duct tape promptly pressed over my—his—mouth.

I felt warm lips find Rowan's ear, a familiar accent pricking my awareness.

Sam. 

Rowan’s friend. 

“He's still inside you, but don't worry, okay? I'm going to get him out. Permanently.”

Aware of Rowan’s body shutting down, I tried, once again, to jump *back*. 

But I was stuck. 

I was stuck inside cold dead flesh that should have died a long time ago. 

That was suspended, cruelly puppeteered, by an impossible light. 

I woke up half naked on a surgical table, my wrists– his– wrists strapped down. 

When I opened his eyes, invasive light blinded me. 

Twisting my head, I was inside a dimly lit room. 

Above me, wasn't a *light*. It was the moon, bleeding through a skylight. 

“I brought you down here so you would be more comfortable,” Sam's voice was low, almost gentle. 

I felt his fingers stroke through Rowan’s hair. “When you were… you know, not *yourself*, that's what you used this place as,” Sam hummed. “You brought innocents down here, tortred them to submit, and then sacrificed them.”

His words slammed into me as my gaze found carvings on the walls. 

The same ones covering the walls and floors upstairs. 

A different language, a twisted devotion to an unseen entity. 

“But I'm going to save you,” Sam whispered, his voice shuddering. 

When he forced my mouth open, lodging something rubber between my teeth, I tried to open my mouth, to scream I wasn't Rowan– that I was STUCK inside his body. 

But when he violently jerked my head to the left, I caught something in the corner of my eye. 

Another surgical bed, this one stained crimson, blood still pooling over the edge.

I only had to see the scruff of dark blonde curls poking from a blood drenched blanket, a single limp arm hanging over the edge, to understand what was happening. 

“Just like I saved him,” Sam murmured. 

In his hands, a sledge hammer, and an ice pick, the edge already stained revealing red. He leaned closer, and I screamed into the rubber thing lodged between my teeth. 

“Look, I know it's messed up, and I *know* it's wrong. But it's the only way,” he said. “If I, you know, fuck up your brain, then surely, he won't be over to take you over.”

Sam leaned closer, a single lock of hair hanging in his eyes. 

“I'm doing this to protect the town,” he said. “From you, and that psycho bitch.”

I squeezed my eyes shut, when I felt the prick of the needle inside Rowan’s eye. 

I waited for darkness. Waited for agony. 

Instead though, Sam let out a sudden shriek. 

I didn't see it. But I did *hear* this thing rip Sam apart. 

I heard it take its time, snapping his spine, and then tearing into him, gorging on whatever was left. I heard his blood seeping across the concrete floor, his strangled breaths bleeding into nothing. 

Then, I sensed it moved closer to me. Its heavy breath tickling my face. 

When I risked opening my eyes, I found myself nose-to-nose with Charlie. 

His hollow eyes were empty, lacking humanity, instead, a feral, animalistic glare, seeing me as both a threat, but also wary of me. 

His lips curled back, exposing sharp, elongated teeth stained in Sam. A gaping hole split open his skull, an attempt at lobotomizing him. After staring me down, the guy leaned closer, inclining his head. 

“Who the fuck… are *you*?”

I had words in my mouth, but Rowan's mouth wouldn't move. 

I managed to wrench his lips apart to speak, before I was being catapulted *back*. 

Which meant only one thing. 

Someone had moved my body. 

Detaching myself from Rowan’s soul was like pulling myself out of quicksand. 

I felt no panic, no pain, no desperation, inside him. He was nothing, a void vessel that was somehow alive. I saw glimpses of memories, a skylight taken over by the moon, cruel rope wrapped around his wrists, and two bodies pressed to him. 

I felt exactly what he did– a steel knife slicing his throat open. 

And the light above, enveloping him. 

I saw his trembling hands full of slithering strands of flesh. 

I heard his cries, his screams, his sobbing, the boy’s fragmented soul crying for mercy. 

Kill me. 

Please, kill me. 

Fucking kill me. 

Kill me! 

His thoughts bled away as fast as they had come. 

I felt the familiar prick of pain inside my own body. 

My snapped wrist. 

I awoke, lying on my back, staring at the dark sky through a thick canopy of trees. 

Footsteps. 

“So, the stalker is awake.”

Rowan. 

He towered over me, lost in the moon’s shadow. 

I couldn't take my eyes off the chunk of bone adorning his curls. 

Like a crown. 

This was exactly what he had hoped for. Life after death. 

But did he really want *this* life? 

Rowan dropped something onto my head, and when I could move, I dragged my body to a sitting position, dragging my fingers through my hair. It was a…crown. 

This time, made of entangled vine and roses. 

“I want to play a game with you,” he murmured. 

I was so weak, my body betraying me, blood spluttering from my mouth. 

“You run.” he said, his voice teasing, as I forced myself to my feet, biting back a cry. 

“and I'll catch you.” Rowan paused, pulling out a pack of cigarettes, sticking one in his mouth, and lighting it up. 

He took a drag. 

His eyes were both beautiful and horrifying, twin stars of illuminated oblivion. “I'll give you a head start.”

I did start to run, throwing myself into a sprint. 

He didn't run after me. Rowan didn't move a muscle. 

When I twisted around, he was still standing there. 

Watching me.

It's been maybe six hours. I'm still safe, but I don't know how long. 

I've been inside his body. I've seen and *heard* his soul crying out. 

But even now, I can sense him breathing down my neck. 

He's getting closer.

In the dead of silence, I can already hear his slamming footsteps. 

He's already running. 

And he's going to fucking *catch me.*
