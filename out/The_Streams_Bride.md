When I was little, from the ages of 6-13, my family and I lived in a house in a country town in California. It was an acre of land surrounded by wilderness with no neighbors for about 5 miles in any direction. While my brother, Ryan, and I had things like TV and video games, we spent most of our time exploring and playing in that stretch of wilderness. 

The land surrounding the property was classic California chaparral; rolling, sunbaked hills covered in a mix of shrubs and low standing trees with the occasional oak or pine sprouting out over the sea of green, yellow and brown. We had diverse wildlife; red tail hawks, condors, diamondbacks, coyotes, and raccoons, to name a few. Looking back, it’s a wonder our parents ever let us venture out there alone. They definitely had more of a hands off approach when it came to us, though we did tell them we never went further than half a mile which was a lie. Our days consisted of scaling rocks, exploring canyons, and attempting to catch lizards and bugs. 

Though it was beautiful, outside of rocks, shrubs, and trees, there wasn’t all that much out there to be seen. Except for one thing. Deep into the wilderness, by a stream that trickled down a ravine between 2 hills, was the wreckage of an old car. It was difficult to say what type or make, as many of its parts were scattered and broken. Its front was planted into the side of one of the hills and most of the rest of the car could be seen nearby. Rusty metal and old, deflated tires had begun to sink into the mud and sand of the stream’s bank.

Of course, neither of us knew how it got there or why it had been abandoned. But naturally, we treated it like a playground, jumping off of the roof and splashing into the stream, hitting it with sticks, or throwing rocks through the already broken windows until we ran out of energy. After that, we sat by the stream and theorized about the car, spinning our own stories of its past. We had several: the car was haunted, a trap left here by monsters to lure people to it, or that it was from another dimension entirely. My brother suggested the owners of the car must have been gangsters who crashed into the ravine while escaping the police. What’s more, their drug money was surely still hidden somewhere nearby. 

Although a childish fantasy, the idea of buried treasure was too alluring to resist, and we spent many long afternoons digging around the stream, looking under rocks, and checking behind tree trunks in hopes of finding some bandit’s forgotten riches. Though our search usually only turned up the occasional old beer can, it became a game to us. Over the course of 3 summers, we must have combed through every square inch of that wilderness. 

I remember one summer in particular, when I was around 9 years old. Ryan had gotten the flu and, as such, was stuck inside. To my great dismay, I had no one to go exploring with anymore. I asked my parents how long it would take for the flu to pass and they told me a week or 2. Being a 9 year old, 2 weeks was an eternity. But disappointment quickly turned into selfish excitement: I decided I’d go alone to find the bandit’s treasure, stealing all of the glory and riches for myself. 

To give some context, my brother had always been a sleepwalker. My mom or dad would often find him sitting downstairs on the couch or standing in the kitchen at late hours of the night, eyes still closed. They’d gently lead him back to bed, attempting not to wake him. I don’t remember from where, but it had been ingrained in me that you shouldn’t wake a sleep walker. So when the night came that I was the one who found him sleepwalking, I was determined not to. 

It was a little bit after midnight and the Santa Ana winds were rattling the walls and windows, keeping me up. In frustration, I got out of bed and went down to the kitchen for some water. I trudged along the dark hallway, down the stairs and into the room that separated the kitchen from the living room. I turned to the living room and my heart stopped for a brief moment. Ryan was sitting on the couch, fast asleep. Though he was asleep, he was sitting straight up, peering out the window into the darkness through closed eyes. 

I ignored him, continuing on to the kitchen. After finishing my drink, I returned to the living room to get Ryan back to bed. I figured that his sickness was just making his sleepwalking a little bit worse. But when I looked, Ryan wasn’t there anymore. The living room was empty. I checked back upstairs in Ryan’s bed only to find that it too was empty. I was considering waking my parents when I spotted him. He was standing outside on the porch overlooking the slope that led outside of our yard. Even with the porch light on, the wilderness was a looming, thick darkness that consumed any light from the house. I immediately went to go get him, not caring about waking him at this point. I was cold and tired, my frustration at having this chore forced on me was evident as I yanked on his arm, turning him to me. Speaking in a state like this also wasn’t uncommon for Ryan. He’d mumble nonsensical phrases about cartoons we had watched, games we played, or whatever he was dreaming of. But the words that came out of his mouth this time were crystal clear, and they made my blood run cold. He lifted his arm out slowly, pointing into the blackness ahead of us.

“She’s looking for you.”

His nose began to bleed. A thin trail of red dripping from one of his nostrils. 

Fueled by fear, I sprinted to my parents room and shook them. Out of breath, my explanation must not have made sense to them. But I was able to get the words ‘Ryan’ and ‘outside’ across to them. They followed me downstairs to the living room. Ryan was still outside, again facing the wilderness. They scolded me for not bringing him inside before going out, scooping him up, and carrying him into the house. Even now, I have no idea how he had stayed asleep through this. The wind outside was moving fast enough to kick up dust that stung as it peppered my skin. I didn’t sleep that night.

That morning, I went to my parents in another attempt to explain what had happened. I was still at the age where my parents were the ultimate authority and seemed all-knowing. So when they told me that the fever aggravated Ryan’s sleepwalking, I didn’t question it. Still, I was unsettled and tired enough that I decided my solo treasure hunt could wait a day. I spent the majority of that day sleeping.

The next day, I set out early in the morning with a sense of purpose. I went over the rocky, shrub littered path our repeated trips had carved into the foliage until I made it to the stream. The day was almost silent, save for the wind in the leaves and the trickle of water over mud and sand.

The car had become a familiar sight at this point, and we had given it somewhat of a personality. It was more than just wreckage to us, but a private and almost sacred place that only my brother and I knew about. I sat on one of the old tires, the bottom half of which was submerged in sand, to rest.

In my childish state of excitement for treasure hunting, I had not considered the possibility of fear or danger. But sitting there by myself, with steep, overgrown slopes on either side of me, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I shouldn’t be there. The old car now gave off a feeling of forbiddance and the rustling of the leaves no longer sounded innocent. The air itself felt heavy, the same feeling that happens right before a disaster. As if everything around me was collectively holding its breath. 

My thoughts immediately, and involuntarily, shifted to the events of the night before. Ryan's words repeated in my mind,

“She’s looking for you.”

Every instinct I had was telling me that I was being watched. I was filled with the panicked need to flee, to be anywhere else. And so, I ran as fast as my legs could carry me back up the hill and away from the car. I dashed through bushes, ignoring the trail in a straight line to my house, to safety. Brambles cut my arms, face and legs, but I didn’t feel anything outside of the overwhelming fear that encompassed me.

As I ran, the tempo of my feet hitting the earth was interrupted by another set of footsteps. Footsteps that were heavier than mine, and rapidly growing nearer from behind me. Whether or not this was the imagination of a child or not, fresh panic filled my veins that gave me speed I didn’t know I was capable of. I didn't dare look behind me. My brother and I surely had been right, some beast had lured me out here and now was taking the opportunity I had given it to devour me. 

I clambered over the last rocky hill, tears staining the dust beneath me. I sobbed with relief when at the sound of my father’s voice calling for me. I had made it to the house. At some point in my desperate flight, the footsteps had vanished. But it didn’t matter to me. I hopped under the yard fence and sprinted to my father, clinging to his leg in fear.

Through tears and sobs I choked out a child’s explanation of what had happened. He scolded me for going out into the wilderness alone but I didn’t care. I never wanted to set foot out there again.  The rest of my day was spent inside with my sick brother. I told him about what had happened too but he didn’t believe me, instead accusing me of trying to hog all the treasure for myself. 

The rest of the day, I attempted to distract myself with the new Nintendo my parents had bought us for my birthday. Night time came and by then I had successfully calmed down. My parents had convinced me that I had just been scared by my own imagination. That the sounds I had heard weren’t real. This soothed me to the point that I was able to push my fears out of my mind. Honestly, I wanted them to be right. I fell asleep quickly, all the panic and running taking its toll on me. 

Over the next few days, I stayed within the confines of the yard, not daring to go back out to the wilderness. But days became weeks and the fear I felt began to fade. After all, all that had happened was I imagined some noises and caught my brother sleepwalking. I kept telling myself this, trying to build up the courage to go back out to the place by the stream. But every time I approached the fence at the edge of our yard, I would stop and look out to what waited ahead. The wall of trees and shrubs on the other side felt unusually ominous, as if they were waiting for me. And in those moments, no amount of rationalizing could overcome my own senses telling me to not take another step. 

By now, Ryan’s flu had passed and he was ready to continue our game of treasure hunting. I, of course, refused and adamantly argued for us to stay inside, or at least within the border of the property. But Ryan always knew how to get what he wanted from me. He taunted me with all sorts of names, saying I was just too chicken and that, when he found the money, he’d keep it for himself. I, again, being young, let my pride and frustration overwhelm my sense of paranoia. 

This trip was far slower than my last. Despite my brave face, I walked behind my brother the entire time, coiled and ready to flee at the first sign of trouble. Like last time, the setting itself felt hostile and cold. As if we were foreign invaders, a virus in the bloodstream of a far greater organism. After about 30 minutes of painful, suspense-filled hiking, we reached the car. My brother, aware of my fear, teased and mocked me for being so scared of a place we had been to so many times before. To prove his point, and to further prod at me, he kicked the trunk of the old car. The sound reverberated up through the canyon; a loud, metallic thud.

I froze, breath held, waiting for something to happen. Surely something had heard that. Whatever it was that had chased me would come bursting through the foliage and swallow us both whole. Even Ryan’s confidence seemed to falter for a bit, his cocky smile fading. We stood there, looking around the canyon, for what felt like hours. But nothing ever happened. No monsters, no running, nothing. This quickly restored my brother's confidence, who didn’t stop making fun of my cowardice for the rest of the day. Although gingerly, I followed along as we explored the wilderness, as we always had done. And later that afternoon, we returned safely home. I was relieved. This proved that my fears had been unfounded and foolish, just like Ryan had said. 

That night, I had the most vivid dream I’ve ever had, even to date. I was still in my bed, it was before dawn and the sun hadn’t peaked over the hills yet, but the pitch black of night had become a dark blue. I shared a room with Ryan. To give a better picture, my bed was in line with the door which led out to a long hallway that connected to both the stairs and to my parents room. In my dream, I could see a figure standing in the hallway facing my room, facing me. It was too dark to see its face at first. The figure walked silently down the rest of the hallway, stopping at my door. I was too scared to move or make any sound. From here, I could make out some details. It was a woman in a wedding dress. Her face was covered by a long veil. The once white cloth was grey and rotten. One hand on the doorframe, she leaned into view, peering at my bed. Neither of us moved and there was no sound for what felt like forever. She brought her other hand to her chin, slowly pulling the veil over her face and behind her hair, revealing a sight I can never forget.

Her skin was slick, as if water constantly ran down from her hair. Her face was green and grey with rot. Patches of flesh were missing, revealing pink meat and yellowing bone. Her mouth hung open in a silent scream, revealing a grey, shriveled tongue preceding the black abyss of her throat. She had no eyes, only dark sockets where they once had been. All the same, I knew she was looking at me. Still, I didn’t dare move. My body wouldn’t let me. We stayed there, holding each other's gaze for another painful eternity. 

I woke up in my bed as the sun hit my eyes. My brother was already downstairs and my parents were drinking coffee in the front yard. I decided to ignore my nightmare and join my brother, the daylight giving me confidence. I wasn’t going to let a nightmare spoil my Saturday. I jumped out of bed and began down the hall. But I stopped, my skin tingling as the feeling of cold, damp carpet met my feet just outside of my door frame.
