I live in a small community in Europe a few hours into the country. Growing up here was boring enough, it's always been a rather typical run of the mill type of town. You see, and I don't want to come across the wrong way but, the town... is changing. *The people* are changing.

Now please don't get the wrong idea, there have always been newcomers to town and they have always been welcomed with open arms, however... there's something not quite right going on lately. Let me explain.

This all started sometime earlier this year. The town is small enough that I have grown up seeing the same faces all my life. I went out for a walk as I do customarily. I waved to a few of the neighbors as I went along. It was common here to exchange pleasantries and find yourself making conversation with passersby.

I saw one of the locals Roman and we talked about what had been happening around town lately. Nothing interesting really. While he was telling me about the latest drama with the town council, I saw him look up, sort of dumbstruck.“Would you get... a load... of that guy...” he said accenting each part in disbelief.

I looked up, down the road where he was staring and instantly understood. The man was wearing an ornate white coat with gold trim. It looked like something you might see adorned on some military captain in an anime, sans badges or insignia. His hair was perfectly styled and his boots were polished to a sheen. In his right hand he walked along with an pointed cane that flared at the handle.“Why hello gentlemen.” he said his teeth almost seemed to sparkle as he spoke.

“Uh, hello. Haven't seen you around town before. You new here?” Roman said suspiciously.

“How rude of me, my apologies, my name is Jaspar Einbacher. I have recently purchased the Nottingham estate in the north part of town. It is a pleasure.” he outstretched a gloved hand to shake. Roman just stood there so I reached over to alleviate the awkwardness of the situation.

“Nice to meet you sir.” I said cutting through the tension.“How delightful, and likewise to you.” his accent was one I had never heard before.

“If I may ask... whereabouts is it that you come from Jaspar?” I said politely as I could.

“Oh.” he said taking pause... “I am from Mertzagovia.”

I was surprised because when I was young I would often study maps and geography to pass the time. I had never heard of it.

“Excuse my ignorance... I don't know of it.” I said with sincerity.

“*Right*... well it is a rather small unknown place in the Alps.” he said as if he was trying to skip over the topic. I saw the man glance at Roman and form an uncomfortable smile.“My, it truly has been lovely to meet you here today, but alas I must take my leave. Adieu” the man nodded to us and began to walk away briskly.

“I'm sorry but, *I don't like him*. What was up with his clothes?” Roman scoffed.

“Hmm, I don't know he seemed nice enough” I said, though finding the interaction somewhat strange. The fact I had never heard of Mertzegovia bothered me more than it should.

Roman and I talked for a short while longer. He mentioned that it must have cost a small fortune to make the Nottingham estate habitable. It was practically a castle, a relic from a bygone age of dukes and duchesses. We supposed the man was a wealthy investor or came from money. I told myself if I saw him again I would make a point to find out.

\*\*\*

A few weeks had passed and I had almost forgotten about the strange man entirely. I decided I would go to the market to prepare myself a fine home cooked breakfast. As I walked along the cobbled streets I noticed several of the homes had for sale signs. I saw my neighbor Demetri hammering his own into the ground.

"Demetri..." I said in shock "You're selling?" I had known Demetri since I was young. To me the idea that he was leaving was almost inconceivable.

"Well... we'll see what happens. It's the *money*." he said in a faux whisper, his eyes wide, as he leaned in towards me.

"The money...?" I said confused. For the house? The property here had always been worth next to nothing in comparison with the city. Who in there right mind would want to live here?

"Yes, the money!" he said excitedly "Places are selling! It's a hot market. People are buying, don't ask me why! Strange looking lady came around yesterday and bought the first house she came to. In cash!" I tuned him out lost in thought.

"Apparently they're from Herzegovina or something. I don't know why they'd want to move here of all places." he was right, it made no sense. Suddenly the man from weeks ago came to mind.

"Demetri, are you sure it wasn't *Mertzagovia*?"

"Metzagovia! That's it! Yes, never heard of it myself but... money is money." he said laughing gleefully."Hey who knows maybe I'll go somewhere exotic!" revealing a missing toothed grin.

I had forgotten about the strange place I had never heard of from weeks prior: *Mertzegovia*. How was it possible I had never heard of it? As a child I had spent countless hours reading encyclopedias and surveying maps, there was no way I would have missed it. I checked online and even stopped in at the library to browse the archives but there was no record of any 'Mertzegovia'.

\*\*\*

I got to Beau's Bakery just before ten. The bell clang loudly against the glass door as I entered the shop. I couldn't hide my astonishment when the woman parted the curtains and walked out from the back room.

It wasn't Beau.

"Who... are you?" I said trying not to sound rude. I had never not seen Beau at the bakery. It was her life's passion, everyone in town went to her shop.

"Hello" she said with a wry smile."My name is Ritzigale Luddenheimer... this is my bakery." her head turned slightly as the corners of mouth pushed upward into an unsettling smile. Her accent... it was the same as the man from before, her clothing as equally flamboyant. A flowy gray dress, the fabric layered and transparent. An elaborate gold necklace adorned with gems, and two large amethyst earnings.

"Where is Beau? This is her establishment..." I said in disbelief.

"Oh the woman... *yes*, she is gone. She sold it to me and as far as I know left town." as if it was a matter of fact that didn't concern her in the least. "Can I get something for you?"

*Beau had sold and left town*? She was nearly seventy years old. She had lived in this village her entire life. What could possibly have enticed her to leave? Even if this woman had offered her millions, I was doubtful she would have left."She left?" I said dumbfounded.

"Yes. I know I have big shoes to fill but I can assure you: you, will, be, impressed!" she said punctuating each word playfully. Something about it was unsettling."No. Thank you..." I said as I turned and left. I had lost my appetite. I know, it seems dramatic but if you knew how much of a figure Beau was in the community... for her to just up and leave without a word?

No. It didn't make sense.

I needed some space. Seeing the houses for sale and the new owner of the bakery didn't sit well with me. I didn't know why exactly. I took a walking trail that carved along the hills behind the houses. I was nearly home but as I turned the corner I felt a wave of anxiety.

Two men in fancy coats were conversing in the middle of the sidewalk. They had the same meticulously styled look as the man I spoke to with Roman, and the woman from the bakery. The glanced at me with forced smiles and then continued talking in their language. It sounded vaguely Germanic, Latin and Slavic all at the same time. *Mertzegovian*?

I put my head down and headed home. We had had people from out of town move here before, but... something about these people was different.I don't know why, but for the rest of the day I couldn't shake thoughts of the new residents. Why hadn't I ever heard of Mertzegovia and why couldn't I find it on a map? Why did they wear such strange ornate clothing? Did Beau really just up and leave in the middle of the night? None of it made sense...

I decided to call one of my old friends Elizabeth and ask if she had noticed.

"Hello?" she said sleepily into the phone.

"Beth... hi, sorry I'm calling this late"

'Oh hey! No, no worries. It's not too late, I was just about to go to bed though."

"Oh, sorry" I said kind of embarrassed.

"Well the reason I'm calling is because... well did you know Beau sold the bakery and left town?" I almost couldn't believe it as I was saying it.

"Really?" she couldn't believe it either."Yeah... really. I know I was surprised as well. I saw Demetri was selling too, actually a bunch of people on his street are. Apparently people from 'Mertzegovia' think this back country town is all the rage."

"Hmm... that's odd" she said thoughtfully.

"Yeah... but... have you ever heard of Mertzegovia? Supposedly it's in the Alps or something." it felt foolish even asking.

"Well no... no, I guess I haven't" she was clearly confused.

"Yeah, me neither, and these people. I mean... I don't want to judge, and you know I'm not like THAT, but... there's something weird about them... I don't know maybe it's just their style or whatever... but..."

"Huh, yeah... you know I did see someone at the bus today. He had on a really expensive suit and watch. I figured he was visiting town or something. You know what? Why don't you come over tomorrow morning and we'll catch up over tea?"

After the call my weary thoughts started to disappear. It would be good to visit an old friend. Maybe that's what all my anxiety was all about? I was just cooped up. Once I talked with her I would realize I was overthinking the entire thing.

\*\*\*

I woke up early and made my way over to Elizabeth's. We had grown up together and even though we hadn't seen eachother as much as we used to, we had the type of friendship that when we did it was instantly like old times. I walked up to the door, she had lived in the same home since she was little. I knocked... no answer.

I knocked again, no answer. Suddenly the door opened. The figure standing in the doorway was not Elizabeth. I had never seen the man in my life. Perfectly manicured nails and slicked backed hair, he was one of them. Elizabeth lived alone and had just broken up with her boyfriend. Wouldn't she have mentioned having guests?

"Hi... who are you? I'm here to see Elizabeth." I said hardly hiding my distrust.

"Sorry? Who?" the man said in that strange thick accent.

"What!? Elizabeth? She lives here... Who are you!?' I said incredulously.

"No... I'm sorry. You are mistaken. This is my home. No Elizabeth here." his voice flat.

"She invited me here! Where is she?!" I yelled, my rage boiling up.

"I'm sorry... you are mistaken!" the man said sharply and slammed the door. I pounded on the door but he wouldn't answer. I looked around the block. Two men in top hats with canes looked at me concerned whispering to eachother. I yelled out to them.

"Hey! What is going on here? Where is Elizabeth!?" the men hurriedly walked away.

"Get back here!" I said as I started running to the front gate back to the street to confront them. Then... in the garden. The garden Elizabeth had spent so many hours working in. I picked them up carefully, in disbelief. They were definitely hers, I was certain.

I turned my head and looked back at the house. The man who had answered the door was staring at me ominously from the window. As soon as I made eye contact with him, he whipped the blinds closed. I looked back to my hand, at them covered in dirt... *Elizabeth's glasses.*
