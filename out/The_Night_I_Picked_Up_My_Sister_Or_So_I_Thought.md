I live in India, in the Northeast region, surrounded by hills and winding roads. It’s beautiful, really—the kind of place where mist clings to the treetops and silence settles after dark like a thick blanket.

This happened just last week.

I'm the middle child in my family. I live with my mom, dad, my younger sister—let’s call her M—and my older brother. It’s been the final stretch of my last semester, so I've been buried in books, stuck in my room most of the time. M had just finished high school and scored really well. Her class had a farewell dinner with their homeroom teacher to celebrate. My older brother dropped her off at the venue and came back home.

I was deep in my studies, not really paying attention to what was happening outside my room. I only knew M was out for dinner.

Around 9:40 PM, I suddenly got a call from her. I figured she needed someone to pick her up since my brother was at church—he sings in the choir. I asked her to send me the location. As soon as I got the address, I hopped on my bike and left to get her.

Here’s where things start getting… weird.

I had never been to the area she sent me. Completely unfamiliar. But I trusted Google Maps and followed the route. As I entered the area, everything was pitch dark—no streetlights, no signs of life. There were houses, but they looked abandoned. No lights, no sounds. I figured there must’ve been a blackout. I kept going.

Eventually, I reached the destination. It was a waiting shed on the side of the road. M was standing there in the dark. She got on the back of my bike without saying a word. That was strange—she’s usually bubbly, always telling me about her day.

Trying to break the silence, I asked, “How was dinner?”

She didn’t respond. Maybe she was tired. Maybe something upset her. I didn’t push.

On the way back, just about a kilometer from our house—on a brighter, more familiar street—I ran into a friend standing on the side of the road. I stopped to chat for a second. He asked where I was coming from, and I told him I had just picked up my sister. He looked at me, kind of confused, then laughed as I joked, “Study hard or you'll fail!” and drove off.

When we got home, I told M to hop off while I parked the bike in our separate garage. It was quiet. Too quiet. I called out again—nothing. I turned to check... and there was no one on the backseat.

I froze.

She was gone. Just… gone. I didn’t hear her get off. Didn’t see her walk away. I looked around the garage, the driveway—nothing.

I rushed inside the house. My brother was already home. I asked him, “Did M come in already?”

He looked confused. “No, she’s not home yet. Her friend’s dad just called and said he’s dropping her off now.”

Wait. What?

Right then, M walked in—with her friend, who came in to use the bathroom.

I looked at her, stunned. “Why did you call me earlier?”

She blinked. “I didn’t. I lost my phone on the way. Someone must’ve found it and called you.”

What.

I took my brother to my room and told him everything. He laughed it off, didn’t take me seriously. But I was dead serious. I even showed him the call history on my phone. The call was real. I showed him the location I went to. His face went pale.

“That’s not inside the city,” he said. “That’s way outside.”

And then it hit me—why didn’t I realize I was driving out of the city? I’ve lived here my whole life. I should have known. The road, the houses—I had never seen that area before. I decided to go back there the next day, just to see it in daylight.

But when I retraced my steps, everything was different. There were no houses. No waiting shed. Just trees and open ground.

And the place where I picked up M? It was a graveyard.

As if that wasn’t enough to mess with my head, later that night I took off my jacket and felt something heavy in the pocket. I reached in.

It was M’s phone.

She asked how I got it. I told her someone must’ve called me and I picked it up—simple. But then I asked how she could’ve dropped it outside the city. She said her class had dinner at a resort just beyond the city limits. It could’ve fallen there.

Still confused, I called the friend I had run into that night.

“Hey, do you remember seeing me with M?” I asked.

He replied, “Yeah, I saw you and we talked. But… your sister wasn’t with you, man. I remember being confused when you said you were picking her up. You were alone.”

So what did I see?

Who did I pick up?

And who… or what… called me that night?
