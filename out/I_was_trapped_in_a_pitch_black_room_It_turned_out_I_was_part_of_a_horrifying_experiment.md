A few weeks ago I woke up in hell.

I know this might sound dramatic but once you'd been in my shoes, you would've thought the same thing. I really hope you never have to endure even a fraction of what I had experienced. I'm currently in a hiding spot and away from any real danger, so I thought it was the ideal time to write down the past weeks, in hope someone can understand my situation.

Last month, I woke up lying on a cold concrete floor, my head pounding like an elephant had trampled on it, and I felt like I was barely wearing anything. My hands only felt a skimpy patient gown. It smelled horribly of excrement, which someone had tried to conceal with disinfectant instead of washing the gown thoroughly.

I sat up and screamed in panic as everything went black. I really thought I was blind at that moment until my vision cleared and I could see a bright crack under the door. I was in a room with no lights.

I leaned over the gap and tried to see anything that would tell me where I was. Because I had no idea how I got here. My memories went back to a time when I was sitting calmly in a diner, my girlfriend Flo and her little brother Benny across from me. That was I all I knew. But wherever I was, I didn’t belong here. Not a single soul deserved to be here.

Through the gap I could see a lit corridor surrounded by several dark doors. Mine was one of them. Had I been accidentally locked up in a prison? Or a mental institution? That couldn’t be possible. In my whole life I’ve only had several bouts of depression like any person in their twenties and frequent sleep problems, but I’ve never been the kind of person who bangs their head against walls or plucks out their hair in a manic episode.

After spending the next two or three hours (I completely lost track of time) calling for help and exploring the empty room, I suddenly heard a voice coming from the other side of the room. It was a deep, male voice with a croaking aftertone. 

“Screaming won’t do you any good, brother. It’ll just ruin your vocal cords. Then everyone’s gonna think you’re a chain smoker.”

I couldn’t believe my ears. My panic and despair dropped by half when I heard his voice. It was the first time since I woke up that I found some sense of normality in my terrible situation. 

“Who are you?” I said out loud, pressing my head against the wall, hoping he would answer and confirm that I wasn’t imagining him.

“I’m locked up here just like you, brother.” I heard him smirk.

“How long?” I asked.

“Maybe a few days. It could be a few weeks or months. I bet even you don’t know how long you’ve been here.” 

How right he was. He seemed very confident and relaxed as he spoke, which made me think he had probably spent a long time here.

“Do you know where we are?”

“Definitely not the Radisson Blu. I think they’re keeping us here for some sick experiment.”

I swallowed loudly when I heard the word “experiments”. I’ve read many books and seen many films where people were involuntarily or voluntarily put in situations where their psyche was put to the test. I think one of those works was about the Stanford Prison experiment or something like that, but I knew it was based on true events. In any case, I shuddered at the thought that I could possibly be part of a human experiment. Given the conditions I had to spend time in, I suspected the worst.

“What kind of experiment could this be?” I asked my neighbor.

“I don’t know, they haven’t done anything to me yet. At least I don’t think so.”

I waited, spellbound.

“When I sleep, I often have nightmares about people in protective suits poking around on my body. It always feels so real and painful, but dreams are always real, right? And every time I wake up, I feel around my body and find nothing. I think I’m going crazy, brother." 

“But doesn’t anyone come to feed us? You can’t be here the whole time without eating or drinking anything.”

“Only when I’m falling asleep, they put a tray in the room, right next to the crack in the door so I can see it. On the tray is always the same disgusting food. A dry piece of white bread, a spoonful of porridge and a piece of fruit, usually a couple of slices of pear that are really mushy. And a cup full of water. Then you always have to push the tray through the crack at the end. Only think about leaving the tray with you and you can bite the dust.”

I sank to the ground and listened to his words with a mixture of despair and hopelessness. I didn’t know what would happen to me, if I kept doing what my neighbor had been doing the entire time. Sitting in the dark forever, losing track of time, eating only the bare minimum to avoid starving, slowly but surely going mad … and not getting any answers.

“We’ll definitely find a way out”, I said determinedly. “They can’t just keep us here like this and never let us out. At the first chance we can–“

“I’ve tried everything, brother. I’m sorry I gotta take away all your hope, but we’re at their mercy. The only way outta here is to not touch the tray and just go to sleep.”

His words hurt my soul. Fear rose up inside me again.

“Have you tried?” I asked cautiously.

“Like I said, I’ve tried everything. But the survival instinct can be a real asshole.”

I don’t know why, but the way he expressed his words was the height of the blackest humor and didn’t fit my current state of mind at all, so I just had to laugh. I laughed so loudly and ugly that I couldn’t stop. In the distance I heard my neighbor laughing as well, which only made the whole thing worse. I laughed like I’ve never laughed before in my life. Suddenly I was reminded of the diner, my last known memory before I woke up here. In the memory I saw myself laughing too, Flo and Benny joining in. it was like a Bill Burr stand-up show. I really enjoyed the moment and I think my neighbor was glad that he hadn’t lost his laughter after all this time. 

The two of us kept talking for a few more hours. Most of the time, we talked less about our precarious situation and more about things from our lives outside the room. I told him about Flo, how I met her and how we spent our time at college together before I dropped out. I also told him about my brother Charlie, who I lost in a car accident. As I talked about him, I realized how the pain of losing him hurt way more than anything that had happened to me since I woke up in the room, or that I feared could happen in the future. Nothing came even close to the gravity of his death. I loved Charlie more than anything.

My neighbor listened carefully and then told me a bit about himself. How he dropped out of school at the age of 15 in order to work and support his sick mother. She suffered from multiple sclerosis and only made it until he turned 20. He then slipped into drug addiction and, in his words, spent the last five years simply “cracking up”. 

It went on like this until he announced that he wanted to sleep.

“You should lie down too, brother”, he said sleepily. “Especially when you’re hungry. They don’t let anything inside ‘til you’re dozed off.”

I was about to tell him that I didn’t feel like sleeping at all, but then I heard snoring from next door. I lay down on the hard floor and cursed those who hadn’t even thought about putting a mattress or at least a pillow in there.

I didn’t like doing it, but if I wanted to at least try to sleep, I just had to. I took off my gown so that I was stark naked and folded it into a pillow, which I put under my head. I’m always very picky about my pillows, because for me that’s the most important material for a safe sleep. At home, I could only sleep on an orthopedic neck pillow. My sleeping issues could sometimes be that bad.

I lay on my back and stared at the ceiling, which could also be the wall. An endless darkness without any light or warmth. My neighbor appeared in front me. I heard his voice, which had probably become so croaky from all the screaming, and I imagined what he might look like. I imagined how we would have crossed paths in another life, both of us at our lowest point and each other’s support. I would help him with his withdrawal, and we would become best friends.

Flo and her brother Benny appeared in front of me, sitting in the diner. Each of us was drinking a chocolate milkshake. Benny wasn’t taking the ice cream very well, as he was holding his head and waiting for the brain freeze to wear off. I laughed at his funny expression, but Flo suddenly slapped me on the shoulder, looking all worried. She stammered something I couldn’t hear. She took Benny in her arms. He looked very strange now, as if he was about to throw up at any moment. For some reason I still found this amusing and I continued to laugh while Flo cried and held Benny close. Benny threw up something that didn’t look like food or any other substance resembling puke. It looked like a turquoise and slippery tentacle. The suction cups looked at me like eyes and were so irregularly shaped that any trypophobic person would gag at the sight of it. The tentacle hung motionless in the air. Benny was choking with every second. Flo was sobbing and her eyes were getting redder and redder. My vocal cords were still only emitting laughter. A fat waitress suddenly appeared next to me and, completely disregarding the circumstances, placed a tray in front of me. On it was a dry piece of white bread, the smallest pile of porridge, a banana full of brown spots that I hate, and a cup full of water.

The diner’s lights went out as quickly as they had appeared. Flo, Benny and the tentacle disappeared from my sight and my laughter stopped. I was back in the dark room where I had woken up today (or yesterday or the day before) with no memories.

Only the room was no longer as pitch black as usual but faded into a grayish light emanating from the side of the door. My eyes rolled towards the door where a pair of arms wrapped in latex gloves held a tray in their hands and carefully placed it on the floor. As he leaned forward, I dimly recognized that he was wearing a decontamination suit.

As I became more awake and my mind clearer, I found myself faced with a grave dilemma. If I simply stood up and lunged at him, I would have a chance to get out of this place. But if I remained in this position and gave the impression that I was asleep, the man in the suit would leave me here alone with the gross food and I would have to hope for another attempt, if it ever came. 

As the man in the suit pushed the tray towards me, he looked at me and our eyes met, even though I was just staring into a gas mask with integrated eye protection.

The man backed away and pulled out a walkie-talkie. I wasn’t sure what he was saying because he was stammering so much, but it was obvious that he caught me awake.

I looked at his legs and saw that he was shaking. He was scared. At that moment, I didn’t care what he was so scared of, though. I wanted to take advantage of every chance I had.

I got up from the floor and slowly staggered towards him, making the most disturbing expression on my face. The man walked backwards until he reached the wall and was at my mercy. The grey light completely surrounded me now and I felt like I could see colors for the first time in years. I grabbed the man by his suit and shoved him into the room. His whole body was trembling. I looked him up and down.

“Give me your suit”, I said, mock-croaking.

He didn’t hesitate and took off his green overalls and gas mask, until in the end there was only a lanky boy in his underwear. He looked barely older than twenty. He was sweating all over and I could see a small yellow puddle on his feet. Poor bastard. 

I put on the hazmat suit, the gas mask and his rubber boots. In the suit pockets I found the key to the room. Before I closed the door behind the boy, I said: “You’ll be out of here soon.”

I would have liked to take more care of him, but he wasn’t the one who was trapped here.

I first went past my neighbor’s door and knocked quietly. He didn’t make a sound. I asked him if he was awake and could answer me. No response. I pressed my ear against the door and only heard his snoring. I tried to open the door with the key, but it didn’t click. There was probably an individual key for each door in the hallway. I quickly whispered to him that I would be back soon and went down the hallway.

It really felt like mental institution. There were the same dark steel doors on each side of the hallway. The floor was completely covered in concrete and several fluorescent lights flickered on the ceiling. At the end of the hallway, I passed some empty hospital beds and cleaning equipment. I walked through a maze of more hallways made of nothing but walls until I finally found a slightly open door from which strange noises were coming.

I heard people mumbling, squeaking boots and clinking metal cutlery. I got closer and closer to the door until I could understand some things more clearly. A man and a woman were discussing something excitedly. 

“His numbers are dropping. We need to do it now.”

“Do you really want to risk the possibility that he could be dangerous if you cut him open?”

“It worked with the last anomaly before it died.”

“That was different. That anomaly was 58 years old and suffered from heart problems. We’re dealing with a much younger specimen here, who is also still going through puberty.”

“How long have you been doing this job? Have you ever been down the other hallways and looked at these creatures? Every day I have to bring this filthy food to the worst kinds of humanity and look at their faces. They may look different on the outside, older, younger, taller, shorter, or sicker and healthier. But at the core they’re all the same. We are only doing them a favor.” 

There was silence after that, which made me think that the woman had given in. Curiously, I dared to look into the room, as inconspicuously as possible. 

Another man in a hazmat suit and a woman in a gas mask and surgical gown were bent over a hospital bed. The woman took a scalpel and worked on the body of the person who was lying motionless on the bed.

I leaned closer to get a better look when suddenly the hinges of the door squeaked and exposed me. The man in the suit looked at me in surprise, but the woman seemed to have been startled by the noise because she frantically cut into the patient’s chest before turning around too.

The patient suddenly woke up and screamed loudly, his chest heaving. At that moment I realized it was a little boy. He had curly hair and green eyes and loved chocolate ice cream more than anything. It was Benny.

The man in the suit acted quickly and pulled out a knife and approached Benny. I lunged at him and knocked it out of his hand. We struggled for a while, with him having the upper hand. He was very strong and punched me pretty hard, but I fought back as much as I could. I did everything to stop him from picking up that knife again. 

Meanwhile, Benny got up from the bed, still screaming and his chest bulging out. His screaming suddenly turned into a terrible wheezing sound, as if he was about to vomit his intestines out at any moment. The woman in the surgical gown approached him cautiously, but before she could do anything, Benny knocked her out of the way with full force, leaving her lying motionless on the floor. 

I was still fighting with the man, but finally managed to grab him under the nose and push it up, causing him to release me from his handle in pain. I quickly ran to Benny, although I didn’t know what to do.

“Benny, it’s me!” I shouted, hoping he would recognize me. But the sight of him told me that I was standing in front of something completely different from Benny. I would only recognize this creature in my worst dreams.

Benny’s wheezing got louder, and eventually gigantic, turquoise and slippery tentacles sprouted from his mouth, chest and eyes. I was frozen and didn’t know how to feel.

I knew that creature wasn’t Benny. I knew I’d seen it in my dream. I knew it was real. And I knew it was my fault. 

Its suction cups stared at me again, uneven and disgusting. Before I knew it, it reached out and sucked itself onto me. The pressure was so strong that I felt like I was being sucked into a deep black hole, even blacker than the darkness in had to endure in the room.
