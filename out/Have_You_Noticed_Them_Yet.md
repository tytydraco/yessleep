 I consider myself to be quite the researcher. I usually take in my surroundings before starting any new task. The sound of the wind outside, the subtle drips from a nearby faucet, even the sound of my own breathing. I suppose it shouldn’t have been much of a surprise when I noticed the eyes. 

Though you are probably not as hyper aware of them as I am. They are a brilliant blue, and they do not like it when you notice them. I think they let me see them for the short millisecond I did, purely because they were fond of me. I suppose it’s because you rarely meet someone who is like you. We are both observing everything. 

They watch me, they watch everyone, they watch everything.

You could be reading this and wondering if I even have proof of this, but I don’t. Other than those nights I have stood at my window making nerve bending eye contact with them. I admit that’s not proof. But the way my heart was pounding out of my chest, that was undeniable. I don’t believe I was scared of the eyes directly, but the power they held at the end of their eyelashes. I tried to count them, but the eyes didn’t approve. I don’t remember falling asleep that evening, but I know I woke comfortably in my bed. I was not in my bedroom previously. 

They don’t just stay in the darkness. They just stay directly out of your peripheral. You might catch a quick glance of a blue blur as they move ever so slightly away from your eyes. They do not like eye contact. 

I also know that the eyes… are not just eyes. They are a person- or at least semi humanoid enough to hold a pen and write. They left me a note one night, it was simple and written in brilliant blue ink.

“Your dreams are lovely” 

I'd advise you to look out the window and try to make friends with the eyes. I can’t feel myself regretting the meeting but I’m sure they’d like to see your dreams too. Though, they likely probably have access to it anyways. 

To your memories, your body, your everyday routine. They know everything and see everything whether or not you’d like to meet them yourself. I just think it’s rather nice, having comfort in the dark that I’m not alone.

I had a dream where a soft feminine voice told me to join them in the watching. I don’t feel inclined to decline. The voice told me that I was perfect, my eyes already saw so much in the world. The voice seemed so lonely. Desperate for someone to see what they could- which was everything at once.

If you ever so choose to look closer at the stars or turn your head a bit sharper when you see the flicker of movement in your peripheral… maybe you’ll see me there too. The blue in my eyes have been getting oddly brighter as of late.
