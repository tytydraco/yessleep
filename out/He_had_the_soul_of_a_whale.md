“I have the body of a man but my soul is a whale.” Captain repeated, staring at me, his smile breaching his messy white beard.



“How you mean? Like, you enjoy the ocean?” I responded, cutting the beetroot into mangled slices.



“No sir, I mean literally.” He looked at my hands and how they wobbled between each cut, ruining the angles and leaving huge blocks of red on the wooden board. “I was born a whale, I have the memories of a whale, my soul is a whale's.”



I laughed softly to myself and turned to amuse his ramblings, “And how'd you end up in the old fella’s body?” I pointed my index finger hard into his chest, he stumbled backwards like an old drunk, catching himself before he spilled to the floor.



“Not sure. I remember dying, shot by a gnarled barb of metal, hauled to the top of the ocean, I watched my guts drain down to the sea floor and as I breached I died.” He looked once again at my messy hands, “But I do see the Captain dying too, somewhere off the coast of an island, he was fishing. His boat capsized and he drowned, thrashing desperately for salvation. But I know those memories aren't mine, I know that because they don't come to me without warning, I force them to the surface. The whale's come naturally.”



I let out a hearty laugh and placed my hand on top of the short man's wrinkled head. Ruffling his thinning white mop of hair, “What a story you spin Captain, what a story you spin.”

He snorted, “Why do you laugh?” His face grew sour, “When I tell you sad tales of the sea you do not laugh, when I tell you that I've fallen ill you do not laugh but when I tell you about my death you laugh? I simply don't understand.”



I finished dicing the beetroot awfully and slid it into the salad I desperately wanted to be good, “Captain, you cannot sincerely think I believe you? You've told me about seeing monsters, shadows in the sky and ghostly ships and each time I believed you.” I chuckled again, “But this time, no, you're not a whale Captain, you're a silly old man.”



A realisation shot across Captain's face, “Oh I understand, you think I'm joking! Well I am not, I am a whale in the body of a sea captain.”



“Why'd you wait so long to tell me then?”



“Not sure. Suppose I didn't trust you, until now.”



“And your wife Captain, you speak so fondly of your wife and your kids.” I dished a sloppy salad to Captain and one to myself, “To my knowledge your wife and kids are very much human.”



“I have his love in me, I have his fears, I can understand them but never truly feel them.” He picked through the salad with his fork, “Please boy, believe me. I've waited years to tell somebody, I need you to believe me.”



I shook my head and crammed another mouthful into my gullet, “Don't turn a fantasy into a lie you old kook! I can laugh at your stories but I will not be treated like a fool.” I rose to my feet, staring at the now teary eyed old man, “Gonna flick the bulb on, give me a holler if you need something.”



I heard him call back to me but I refused to listen. I hate liars, I hate old men who think I'm as foolish as a child. 

  I climbed the iron steps up the lighthouse, each footfall wore down my soles and ached my calves. I burned enough calories climbing those steps that dinner was essentially non existent. As I reached the top I saw the sun, nearly setting, the golds and pinks spilled haphazardly over the horizon. I looked down as I am taught to do, for the off chance of an emergency and I locked eyes with the still frowning old man. I gave him no return of emotion, ignited the light and descended the tower.

That night I went to my room for rest with no formalities, I refused to reward his pathetic attempt at a lie. My room connected wall to wall to his, the wood was thin and shook in the sea breeze. No matter how much I tried, I could always hear his late night mutterings, his hearty laughs but that night I only heard weeping. Deep, chesty wails and cries. 

  I slammed my fist against the wall, “Did I upset you old man?” I yelled across and heard his sniffles come to a halt.

 

 “Just a bit son,” his voice was as soft as possible to still be legible, “I just feel like such a fool.”



I rose out of bed, walked onto the soft dirt and shuddered as the cold breeze rattled my bones, cracking open his door, “I'm sorry Captain, I am.”



He looked at me, his lantern making his face glow a soft yellow, “You believe me?”



I shook my head, “No sir, not even slightly sir but I think you believe yourself.” I walked up to his bed and sat at the foot of it, “You've had a rough go of it, you're going a tiny bit mad I reckon. Tomorrow, have the day off, rest, I'll work.”

Captain just nodded and smothered the lantern, resting his old skin on his pillow. I rose to my feet and left. The next morning he didn't get up, he just rested all day. On occasion, when the wind would quiet itself, I would hear him weeping.

The rest of the week went as normal, we spoke less, only making orders to each other to keep the island in shape, deciding who's cooking dinner and what. When we did speak personally it was more humour, small jokes about our cracks popping up past our belt line and how the gulls shit resembled our boss’ face.

  After a sixth day of no politeness, during supper, Captain broke the ice. “I've been thinking my friend, about our discussion.” I nodded, knowing which one he was referring to. “I shouldn’t have started with such a swing, I should have slowly introduced you to the concept.”



I lowered my gaze and stared into the stew Captain had made, “Not again.”



“Just listen boy!” He snapped, vitriol leaking from his words, “For a moment listen to me!” He stuck his dirty finger towards me and after a beat of awkward silence he continued, “I was a whale, a humpback I believe, I had no intelligence, nothing like that of a human. But I had soul, I felt love and I cared for my kind.” He watched my eyes intensely, every blink felt like a moment of respite, “I lived, for many years I reckon, I lived as a whale. Then, the harpoon scorned my flesh, ripped my skin and killed me. The body of Captain died too, fishing for small things, just a day off on his boat.” His gaze relaxed slightly, “I think God switched us, some God, whichever turns out to be real. I reckon he wanted to punish the Captain for his reckless fishing, hooking, dragging, killing, churning and chumming and he wanted to reward me for being so peaceful.”



I rose from my chair, eyes still trained on his. He continued, “I think he believed I deserved reincarnation, I was such a loving whale, such a kind soul. He switched us, to save me and to kill him. I see Captain's thoughts, he was a cruel bastard, cruel to his wife, cruel to his kids and cruel to his pets. I reckon…”



  Before he could finish I slapped him firmly across the cheek, it glowed red immediately, “Enough.” I grunted, “You either take me for a fool, or have been driven mad. I did not agree to work for a psychopath and I will beat the sanity back into you if you ever speak on this matter again!”



He rose to his minuscule height and yelled at me, “You're a month off 17 and you think you can talk to me like that. I outta beat you 'til the sense comes back.”



  I pushed him down, he crashed into the wooden chair, “Go on, beat me.” I walked over and placed my boot on his stomach, “Beat me.” I stared down at the flipped turtle of a man, “I will kill you on this island, and nobody will know it was me. Get it?” 

  Captain nodded and I left to ready the light. 



As I walked the stairs I whacked the side of my head, I tried to shake the nasty thoughts that swirled around them. The man was sick, I was being ruthless and a bully. I told myself on repeat, look after him, care for him, send him home but then his words started up again in my mind and his smug smile returned to my vision, crazy fuck, lying prick. I felt my sanity slipping away. I knew another week on the island with that madman would break my psyche but I persisted.



The next week slogged along, Captain grew so distant I went full days without even catching a glimpse of him. I grew annoyed with this, not only his lack of help but also the fact he was out there mad. He was wandering, wasting his precious hours thinking about being a blubber riddled sea mammal. When I would see him he was watching the ocean, hands in his overall's pockets, staring. Sometimes I would catch glimpses of him bringing fish to his room, I assumed to cook. 

  As I finally went to confront him I saw a crack of lightning turn the horizon into a candle. It lit up the entire ocean, turning the deep, dark blue into a blinding white.

  “Captain, that's a storm you old bastard.” 



He turned to face me, “What son?”



I pointed my finger out to sea, “A storm, we need to hunker down, sandbag the windows, light the tower early.”



He nodded, “Yes, of course.” He walked past me, nothing but sorrow in his eyes. I turned and passed him, pushing the back of his head causing him to stumble. “Why'd you do that?”



I turned and grunted at him, “Quit wasting our time, do some fucking work. I'm shipping you home next week.”



We spent the remainder of the day making precautions, the storm was rolling in quicker than we thought. I grew annoyed that we weren't warned in the slightest. Watching the slack jawed bastard work made me grow sad. I was treating him so poorly. I had an evil growing in my soul, soon it would be too late.

I approached him, the sky growing black above, “Sir, I am sorry.”



He looked at me with deep sagging frown, “Don't waste your breath.” He grabbed a final sandbag and dragged it into his room, leaving it where the door was slightly cracked open.



I placed my hand as softly as I could on his shoulder, “Captain, sir, it's not fair how I've been. If you're going mad or…”



“I AIN'T MAD!” He yelled back, smacking my hand away as rain began to patter on his scalp, “I'm not mad.”



I took a step back, “Captain, understand me, I'll get you help.”



“Help? HELP?! I need no help. I needed a friend, someone I could trust, I thought it would be you, boy,” the rain began to violently pour down, lightning cracked and I could see the rage on his face. The swirling lighthouse occasionally brought just enough light to see his clenched fist, “I know what I am, I know what I became. I don't need help, I don't want help. I wanted someone who would listen to me!”



I spoke up, “We gotta get inside now.” I gestured to the doors and he didn't move.



“You waste of flesh and air, I should turn you to chum and feed you to the sea birds. The gulls would turn you to shit that would feed the krill that would feed my brothers.” I saw his frown turn to a wretched, angry smile, “Cunt.”



In that moment I broke, my mind snapped in two and I grabbed his throat with my left hand and slammed my fist into his cheek with my right. He stumbled back but I held him upright, driving my fist into his cheek once again. I heard a soft yelp followed by a nearly imperceptible, “sorry.”

  I continued wailing on the old man, I held him tall as I bashed his face in. Eventually as the rain got torrential his legs gave way and he fell into the mud, as the lightning cracked and the lighthouse's light swirled into view I saw his swollen cheek and his teary eyes. I watched him desperately grab for some solid to yank himself to freedom but I didn't allow it.



I kneeled over him, mounting him, legs either side of his torso, I once again grabbed at his throat, it took a moment to find as the darkness of the storm made it impossible to see. I began bashing the side of his face in, striking the same side again and again. “I didn't sign up for this job to look after a mental patient!” I yelled between hits, “I didn't sign up to be guilt tripped by some whiney old bastard.” I felt his warm blood soak in between each finger, “It was my father who worked that hideous job!” I felt his cheek split under the force of the blows, “My father killed the damn whales, I just watched, I watched and I hated it!” I felt something cut the webbing between each finger, a stinging pain shot through my arm, “He killed them, I was merely aboard the ship! Why are you punishing me?!” 

I went to drive my bloodied knuckles into his face one final, fatal time but the lightning split the sky and the tower illuminated my sins. Captain laid on his back, the wet mud creeping up his limp body, his cheek was torn open like a wet paper bag. I saw his teeth protruding through his flesh, smashed into little bits that littered his filthy tongue. “Captain?” I asked desperately, I got a pained grunt in return, “Sir, I'm sorry sir.” I dragged him into his room and barricaded us both inside with the sandbag.



I lit his lantern and hauled his shaking body into bed. I looked down at my knuckles and saw what looked like bite marks across them, indents of his teeth. I saw my own blood drain from my body as the wounds gaped open. I had gone too far.

  “Captain, you'll be okay Captain. I'll look after your wounds tonight, I'll make them better!” He nodded and began to curl into a ball. I looked over his body, his throat was purple from my palm, his head already began to swell like a hideous balloon. I used a rag to clean what I could. I tore a huge hunk of blanket from his bed and stuffed the wound. I collapsed into the corner and cried. I didn't even think to treat my wounds, I didn't deserve it.

  As I scanned his room my mind spun in confusion, on his bedside table was three or four fish, sewn together to form one deformed monstrous thing. I had already done enough pain to the old man so I refused to question it but I swear I saw it gasp for air



The following morning the storm had unceremoniously faded, the sky was a vibrant blue, the sun an agonising white. I looked to Captain who was sitting at the edge of his bed, miraculously alive.

  “Sir?” I questioned and he looked to me. His left side was so swollen that he couldn’t open his eye, his teeth still jutted through the tears in his cheek skin.



He stood, his legs shaking beneath him, “Shall we…” he coughed up a wad of muck, “...survey the damage?”



I nodded, I desperately wanted to know how he was doing, if he was going to be okay but I didn't want to remind him or myself of the previous night's events.

  We waddled the shore of the island, debris from our roof was scattered about, paint was torn from the tower. Nearly half the trees were ripped cleanly from their roots. As we reached the dock Captain pointed out to some tide pools that surrounded the island, there were assortments of manmade junk that littered the stones and a single bloodied corpse of something.



As we went to address the mess the toe of my boot caught something, a metal object pinged against the rock. An old, rusted sword, bent, blunt and ancient. I scooped it and looked to Captain who flinched seeing me hold it in my bloodied hand, “It's just interesting sir.” He nodded.



We approached the red rocks and as we closed in, Captain pointed and mumbled, “It's a dolphin.” He quickened his pace and kneeled next to the gutted beast.



I stood a few strides behind him, tapping my new found toy on the side of my legs, “Must have washed ashore in the storm. Gnarly wound.” I pointed the sword towards the dolphin's guts which spilled across the rocks.



I heard the old man sniff as he hanged his head, “You go on kid, I'll dispose of it.” I let out a questioning grunt and he continued, “It'll start to reek in a few days. I'll drag it out to sea and dump it. You search for more ‘interesting’ things.”

  I didn't like his mocking tone but I also refused to make a fuss after the horrors of the night before. I simply turned and continued scanning the rocks. I found more old sea scrap but grew bored and started the day's work.

  The day grew on and I only caught glimpses of Captain. He appeared to be working, collecting tools and supplies and moving around the island. I quickly noticed that he never returned the tools to their original locations. Rope, knives, fishing line and hooks. My guess was fishing which annoyed me, he was supposed to be working but then I remembered his face was a blubbery mess and I forgave him.



The night grew dark and I lit the tower, as I looked down I saw Captain dragging the dolphin across the island, towards our room. A shudder shot through my spine and I remembered that he was planning on fishing and decided he was using the dead sea mammal as bizarre bait.

  I climbed down the tower and headed to my room. I stopped at his door and saw sloppy blood at the base of it, I gave the door a heavy whack and yelled, “Cutting up bait are we?”



“Yessir,” I heard back, “Storms are the best time to fish. Oh also, what'd you do with that sword?”



I patted my belt line where it sat and remembered it was too annoying to carry up the stairs as it would clink against each step, “I left it at the top of the fucking tower.” I kicked dirt in frustration, I wanted to mount the blade above my bed.

  “Goodnight Captain, gonna head in early. Enjoy your fishing.” A wave of calm washed through my body, somehow Captain had forgiven me, somehow I didn't kill him. I decided there and then that I would believe his tall tales and trust that he wasn't mad, just to survive the rest of the working period. It wouldn't last long though.



As I went to rest my head I began to hear grunting from his room, soft almost pained moans. They were rhythmic, beat by beat. I listened intently trying to work out what the hell I was hearing.

  Grunt, grunt, grunt, moan, moan, moan.

  Then I heard the sound of flesh splatting, squishing and liquids gushing to the floor. I tried so hard to perceive what he was doing. I wanted to assume that he was just cutting the beast's flesh into hunks but the groans were throwing me off, the strange smacks were worrying me. As it continued I grew sick, I needed to know what disgusting act the Captain was committing mere inches away from my head. I rose to my feet and stormed outside, and began bashing on his door.



“What the hell are you doing in there? Are you mental?” I tried the handle and it failed, “Locking yourself away to please yourself with a dead sea beast?” I kicked my boot hard into the wood, it immediately cracked and splintered open, sending wood shards across the floor. But I didn't see what I thought I would.

Captain was sitting with his back against his bed frame, the dolphin's corpse across his lap, the bubble on the animal's head had been removed surgically. Looking down at the beast I saw its throat was also opened, spilling rotten blood on the floorboards. My eyes moved from the creature to Captain, in his hands was a manmade organ, a strange ball of dolphin fat, veins and what I believe were vocal chords. I continued to scan his body, he had removed his own throat, it split open like a dissected frog, he had done it so perfectly that only a small spurting of blood could be seen, the rest was still contained in his neck. I shook my head and he smiled at me, such a threatening grimace. 

  “What, the fuck are you doing?” I asked, waiting desperately for an explanation but he gave none, he couldn’t, he had no vocal chords so he just continued smiling.

  “No, no, no, no,” I gripped the sides of my head as the evil thoughts returned, I unconsciously balled my fists and screamed. As I lost my mind, seeing such a hellish act I remembered the blade, a gift from God himself. A sign. I would kill Captain with it.

I tore my way up the tower, each footfall causing a thunderous clang that echoed all around me. I charged myself up the structure, I was so desperate to rid this world of such a sick man, I should have done it the night prior, bashed his brain to pulp. As I continued up I heard a strange whistle sound shoot up from behind me, like a squeaking shoe or an alien trumpet. Then I heard Captain's footfalls behind me, he was chasing me and fast.

  Another whistle noise, this time so loud my ears rang, I felt the bones in my body tremble momentarily. 



“Boy!” Echoed up from behind me, but it didn't sound exactly like Captain, it was his voice but fused with a mountain lion's scream, “Come down to me, boy!”

  I ignored the horrendous voice as shockwave after shockwave come up towards me. Each sounding like a whistle, getting closer and closer.



I breached the door to the main room and I saw the blade lying on a bench. I ran for it and just before I could grab it I heard one final deafening screech. My ears popped, I felt my organs shake in their positions and my stomach churned. The very sound itself tore apart my insides and I collapsed to the floor, slamming into the bench, the sword clattering to the ground next to me.

  I grabbed it and tried to pick myself up, blood seeped from my nose and down my lip, my vision was blurred and my ears ringed. “What did you do?” I mumbled out, turning to face my attacker.



It was Captain, his torso was normal, his clothes caked in filth, each finger was sewn together to make flippers. His neck was a bulbous hunk of fat, the strange organ he constructed from the dolphin sewn into his throat, the rope securing it so it didn't plop off from the weight. He grinned at me, “I know how they work,” his voice was so monstrous and strange, like I was listening to strained radio static, “I was one, I know how they work.”



I shook my head in disgust, “You were NEVER a whale, you were always just a mad, little, old prick.” 

  He opened his mouth and a deafening screech escaped it, causing my body to shake, my guts to churn and my nose to bleed helplessly but I pushed forward, raising the worn blade well above my head and slamming it into his skull. Immediately he was silenced, the blunt edge didn't cut his skull but it smashed it, bludgeoning the top immediately into a fractured pulp. 

  He tripped over his own feet and fell backwards down the stairs, colliding violently into the rung and wall, each step he crashed into echoed down the tower before he finally stopped, once again he was curled into a ball.

The fleshy thing attached to his throat was scattered to bits across the stairs, he weakly looked to me as I descended, ready to finish the job. 

 

 “When you kill me,” he spoke, still so alien, “I will be reborn as a graceful whale once more, happily breaching and eating krill.” He propped himself up against the wall, “When you die, alone and old, you will be reborn as a worm, swimming through mud and shit. A fisherman will pluck you from a bucket and stab your guts with a hook, he will lower you into the salty sea and your wounds will scream in unending agony. Then you will die again, born once more as another filthy worm, forever, for eternity.”

I reached the step above him and he grinned at me. I bashed his skull in until there was nothing but a neck stump left. I hauled his corpse to the rocks and left him to rot. I cleaned his room and the tower. Then I radioed in that the storm had swept poor Captain away, that I found his body dashed against the rocks. 

  They believed me.



Years have passed now. I am old. I sit on the edge of my own boat. A leisure boat I use in my retirement. At home I have no love, no kids, no pets, nothing. Out here I have no friends to fish with, just myself and my guilt.

  Something is bumping the bottom of my boat, causing it to rock back and forth. Something big. A whale.
