It was the brisk night of mid-October when a group of friends and I were told about a haunt attraction about twenty minutes away from our college campus. I personally wasn’t a huge fan of these types of things because they always felt off to me. I mean what person decides to make money and fame off of making bloody and horrific scenes to traumatize people with? But after all of my friends unanimously decided to go, I knew I would end up there anyways. 



There were six of us that went. Myself, my roommates Conner and Mike, and three of our other friends Jennie, Cassie, and Claire. We all sort of hung out these past few years and became close. My roommates had a tendency to act like morons most of the time, and Jennie and Cassie just encouraged them in return. But Claire was always my go-to out of our group. She was considerate, happy, and not bad looking either. Unfortunately most of our school thought so too, so I knew the farthest I would get was the friendzone.



We all piled into Conner’s van and made the trip to a place called “Victor Sinister’s Carnival Of Screams”. It was pretty far out into the countryside, about a solid 10 minutes away from any civilization. We pulled up into a gravel lot that was fenced off by metal poles with caution tape connecting them. There were maybe ten cars at most, which made it odd that an attraction this close to halloween would be desolate on a friday night. We just wrote it off as being small so nobody had likely heard of it.



We approached a ramshackle entrance gate with a crusty and rotting sign that read “ADMISSION $9” which seemed fairly cheap for an attraction like this. We all approached the booth by the gate and were welcomed by a dirty and foul man who likely was homeless before this gig. He took our cash and walked into a backroom but never came back with our change. Since it was just a dollar, we figured we would cut our losses and proceed.



The path ahead of us was a dark and twisted path into the woods, where we could see lights blinking up ahead behind some trees. Mike and Conner played around with Jennie and Cassie, screaming and jumping out at them while they pretended to be scared. Claire walked up beside me and bumped my shoulder. “Are you scared?” she asked me, with a sarcastic smile. “Oh yea, absolutely terrified!” I responded in my own sarcastic tone while laughing. Claire walked with me while we watched the other four mess around on our walk to the lights, which we could now see was a circus tent surrounded by wooden shacks. 



“My Dad would always take me to these kinds of things when I was younger.” Claire told me. I knew her relationship with her father wasn’t a good one. The details were foggy but I recall a lot of abuse and neglect was involved. I hated it for her because she was such a soft and tender person who couldn’t hurt a fly. “Did you like them? Like was it something you enjoyed doing?” I asked her. She stayed silent for a moment with only the screams of our friends being heard. “Not really. Dad always brought me along with his friends because he thought it was funny to watch me be scared.” Claire explained. I held my head down and apologized for bringing up a sore subject. She just giggled and told me it was fine.



We approached the circus tent when a large clown mannequin that sat in a booth shot a green substance from its mouth and splattered all over Mike and Jennie. Mike laughed but Jennie didn’t see the humor of being covered in fake vomit. She almost started to cry when Mike reminded her that it was just fake slime you could buy at the store, and it would wash out. We walked under the archway of the tent to enter, all while Jennie wiped her hair out of the gooey substance.



Inside was a bunch of stacked up cages with various props and animals inside of them. Loud music played hauntingly in the background as we walked through the dark room. The first disturbing scene was a young actress, maybe in her twenties, was locked in one of the cages with her hands bound to the wall. She had realistic wounds and blood covering her town hoodie and jeans. She called out for help over and over but we trudged onward to avoid the awkwardness of the situation. Conner and Cassie remained silent but Mike and Jennie haggled the woman and tried instigating a reaction but to know avail, only more cries for help. 

The next scene we entered was a room with three corridors in it. Before we could analyze the path ahead, an actor in full clown makeup jumped out and laughed. “Which way? Which way? Which way, indeed! Pick a hall and have a ball! Two of you young ones per path, lets go, lets go! Don’t make it last!” the clown shouted and pointed all around. We agreed to split into groups of two and proceed. Claire chose to go with me which boosted my confidence tenfold. The other four wandered down their paths laughing and screaming.



Our path led to an outdoor area where witch-like actors and actresses were having a seance of some sort. They all stopped simultaneously and turned to face Claire and I who stopped dead in our tracks. They rose to their feet and grabbed Claire's arm gently while they guided her to the middle of the circle they were sitting around. They all then chanted something over and over while she stood there giggling at what was about to happen. Suddenly they all grabbed something from their pockets and threw them at Claire. She screamed in a panic and bolted towards me while the coven of witches laughed. It turns out they threw live spiders at her, which is one of her biggest phobias. As she ran and grabbed onto my arm, one of the witches approached us and before we could react, jammed a spider in Claire’s mouth.



She screamed much louder than before and spit the spider out while gagging. I shouted at the actress who was now fleeing the scene and into the woods. I turned around to see Claire was throwing up where we stood. I ran to check on her, ll while dodging the spots of bile around me. “Claire! Are you okay? Did it bite you?” I asked in a panic. “No…I don’t think so. What the heck kind of person does that?!” she said in a disgusted and weak voice. I consoled her as we noticed a doorway light up that seemed to lead back into the main tent.



This room was an odd one. There was a straw dummy spinning on a big target on a stage. A skeleton in a barkers outfit sat up via a rope that hoisted the drop to a standing position. “Come one, come all! Hit the dummy square in the head to open up the hall!” said a speaker that sat by the prop skeleton. A bucket of axes and knives was then lit up in front of us. I looked at Claire, and we both shrugged and approached the bucket. Grabbing the first knife, I threw it at the dummy only for it to bounce off. “You have to throw it like you mean it, stupid!” Claire heckled. “Oh, by all means, web breath!” I instigated, while handing her an ax. I guess it was still too soon because she just shot me a piercing gaze and clutched a knife. 



She quickly threw it fast as a bullet and the knife sunk into the dummy’s chest. She turned to me and made a mocking smile. I smiled back at her, at least happy that she was happy. We waited for the door to open, but nothing happened. “Wait, it has to be a headshot! Chest shots don’t count.” Claire said in a determined voice. She approached the bucket once again and prepared to fire. With a well aimed shot, she hit the dummy in the leg as it continued to spin. The spot in the chest began to leak a red substance which we presumed to be a poorly put together mixture to imitate blood. Claire huffed as her determination began to dwindle.



“Having trouble? Here’s some help! Now on the double!” the intercom chanted. A small box fell from the catwalk above, and landed on the ground. It was a single revolver, with what looked like only one shot in the chamber. Claire and I exchanged looks, and without hesitation, we both turned our eyes to the dummy. I grabbed the gun and point it at where I knew the dummy’s head would be once it rotated. Claire shouted for me to fire nearly ten times before I finally pulled the trigger. I was shocked to find out it was a real gun that, to my surprise, fired a real shot. Aside from how dangerous that was, we both noticed where the head of the dummy used to be. “Nice shot! But I think it was a little extra to put that much fake blood into a dummy. That stuff got on my shoes!” Claire shouted. 



I looked over to see the doorway was now lit. Claire and I walked over to it as we passed by the now stationary target with the dummy on it. We both audibly grunted as the smell of whatever they filled it with passed through the air. One thing that stood out to us that made us feel uneasy was the only people we had passed or even seen were now walking past us in the corridor, but they didn’t look like they were up for conversation. They seemed worried and on edge, making a point to bolt right by without even making eye contact. We shrugged it off as just people being scared and entered the last room. 



Inside we found Cassie crying on the floor, covered in blood and bruises. We ran over to her and knelt down. “Cas! What’s wrong, where is everyone?” Claire asked in a worried tone. Cassie turned to us with wide eyes and looked shocked to see us. She was crying hysterically, and neither of us could understand her for a brief moment. “This place…it isn’t a show, it’s real. I saw them! They took Conner and Jennie!” she said in between breaths. I looked over at Claire as we helped Cassie to her feet. She cried out in pain as we raised her up. She had a broken leg, we could see the bone sticking out. 



“Cassie, who did this to you?!” I asked in a panic. She looked past me and screamed. A large figure emerged from a cage that was freshly open, and bolted into the darkness at the other side of the room. “That, that thing did!” Cassie yelled. I turned to look at my surroundings. There were more cages stacked around us, each with different nameplates on them. Most of the cages were tiny and held small creatures in them, but several were large, and could easily fit a human. One cage read “Harry The Hare” which was smashed to pieces with it’s resident nowhere in sight, another read “Sally Snake”. The one we saw open read “Abe The Ape”, and it was now empty. 



Cassie cried in a panic as she looked around for the beast. Just then, Mike knocked over a wall and light flooded into the room. He was visibly hurt and limping. “Guys we have to get out of here, this pla-“ he said as he was cut off abruptly. Mike was ya is by his ankles into the dark corner Abe resided in. We all winced and Cassie cried as we stayed silent out of fear. First we heard Mike screaming, and then the screaming stopped instantly. The noise that followed was an awful, meaty crunching noise that sounded horrific. 



We all took this opportunity to make a run for the now open exit, courtesy of Mike. As we passed his last location, we the beast’s glowing eyes peer up at us from his meal. We didn’t hesitate to keep running. The room we ended up in was a flashy and colorful room. Polka dots and stripes lined the dirty cloth walls of the tent. The room filled with clowns of all shapes and sizes. But the ones that concerned us were the ones dressed in doctors outfits and surgical clothing. A female nurse with clown makeup approached our group, who stood at the ready to fight if we needed to. 



“Oh dear! Honey, you look hurt! Let’s get you patched right up!” the nurse said in a sinister tone. “Back off! Get out of our way you sick freaks!” I shouted at her. Claire and I were holding up Cassie due to her injuries, but we felt Cassie get yanked back by a group of clowns who threw her onto a nearby table. She cried out in pain as they removed her bloody and torn clothes and replaced them with a dirty hospital gown. I wanted to intervene but I couldn’t bring myself to leave Clair alone, not after what I was witnessing happen to Cassie. 



“We’re losing the patient!” said a tall clown, now reaching for something in his bag. Cassie screamed and kicked at her assailants but it did nothing. “We’ll have to amputate, boss!” A short clown said to the nurse. A nurse pulled shot the clowns a twisted smile as Cassie flailed even harder, knowing what was about to happen. The clowns then all grabbed her arms and legs and pulled in different directions.



We watched in horror as the event played out. First we heard the crunches, and then we heard the tears. Finally, we saw Cassie's limbs give way like a wishbone. Claire screamed, but I was just left speechless. Cassie tried to scream too, but she couldn’t muster a sound. The killing blow came from the nurse, who pulled out a large mallet with the word “FLATLINER” written across it. She brought the hammer down and reduced our friend's head to nothing but paste.



The clowns turned their twisted gaze over to us, and we knew if we didn’t act fast, we were dead. Claire backed up, she had tears swelling in her eyes as she whispered “please..no..no…” over and over again. I backed up as well, but my foot met a large canister of gasoline. Thinking faster than I ever have before, I grabbed the can and dumped the contents all over the ground. All I needed now was an ignition source, which I found by an exposed wire dangling by Claire’s head. Upon contact, the whole floor lit up like a bomb, and I turned to Claire and shouted for us to run. 



We ran back through all of our previous rooms, before finally reaching the outdoor area that the witches were at. I grabbed Claire and told her to run into the woods and not to stop until she finds help. She begged me to come with her but I knew I could distract them long enough for her to escape. Reluctantly she ran towards the tree’s, but as she set foot into the circle on the ground that the coven had drawn, she fell to her knees.



She screamed in pain, it was a sound that made me shake. The cry grew louder and louder until I saw the witches emerge from behind her. They whispered something under their breath as I charged the nearest one and pummeled them to the floor. I grabbed the witch and beat relentlessly until I noticed none of the others were coming to her aid. “What did you do to her?!” I shouted, raising my fist again to strike her bloodied face. She just laid there, cackling and coughing.



I heard Claire stop screaming, as a nightmare of sequences played out. First, laid on her back coughing and gagging. Then, thousands of yellow, and red glowing spiders poured out of Claire's mouth. They had thorax’s that resembled balloons or even the circus tent itself. They crawled around the ground surrounding Claire who was now motionless on the dirt symbol. 



I ran over while the coven was distracted by the tiny spiders and scooped Claire from the floor. I had tears swelling in my eyes from the thought of my now possibly dead best friend. But not letting my feelings take over, I looked into the treeline and ran. I didn’t stop for nearly three miles when I saw the light of a gas station in the distance. I heard the laughs of the circus echoing through the woods and cornfields as I ran towards the light.



When I arrived, I was relieved to find regular patrons instead of more “actors”. I called for an ambulance and the police. I tried to explain everything to them before they went to investigate. I opted to ride in the ambulance with Claire to the hospital, and to my greatest relief, she showed signs of life, and eventually came to. She had countless bites all over the inside of her body, and an odd toxin within her that caused her to hallucinate for a while, but over time it faded away.



The police called me around three or four hours after they left to investigate and asked me to go to the station to talk about what was found. When I got there, I was immediately asked to identify three bodies that had been found. I shuddered at thinking of my friend's demise, but knew I was the only person capable of identifying them right now.



The first was a body that seemed like it had been put through a wood chipper. Bones were gnawed and chewed on, some limbs even removed entirely. I knew that this had to be Mike. The next was a torso covered mostly by a blanket. Judging by the horrific carnage that had unfolded hours prior, I knew this was what was left of Cassie. Finally, a body was shown that seemed mostly intact, but lacked a head. It was as if it had been blown off by a cannonball. I didn’t recognise the body at first but when I was told this body was found strapped to a large wooden target…I didn’t want to dwell on what had truly happened.



The police told me that Jennie had actually been found alive. When they arrived, she was chained into a cage with a dirty clown outfit on and poorly drawn face paint. She was in no mood to speak to anybody and was traumatized beyond words. I couldn’t blame her, if she witnessed half of what we had witnessed, then that would be enough.



Claire eventually recovered after about a week. When we left the hospital, she never left my side. As of writing this, it’s been four years since that night, and Claire and I are now engaged. I’m only writing this now because I’ve been seeing more than one post or account discuss the very situation we went through. They all describe a circus in a desolate area that had frighteningly real sets and scenarios. One account even reported that a friend of theirs had gotten lost, and was yet to be found. I almost wanted to tell them what likely had happened, but I wish I had the luxury of being naive to this situation myself.



Let this memoir be a warning to all of you. Don’t trust places or things that appear to be fake. You would be surprised at how often evil disguises itself as more evil.
