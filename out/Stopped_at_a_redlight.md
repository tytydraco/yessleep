"God damnit I know I had a lighter around here somewhere" 

I looked down at the passenger floor for the third time in as many minutes. Sadly, having just cleaned it for the first time in a month, I could see clearly that there wasn't a lighter that had gotten away from me. 

"And I just left the shop. I don't wanna stop again" I whined out loud again to no-one in my truck. 

The day had already been such a long day. After 11 hours on the roof in the heat, dodging tempers of ornery journeymen while trying to keep my own in check, my pre-roll was calling my name. It'd only take a minute to stop at a gas station but, as I felt the dried sweat and roof grime making my forehead tight, I didn't want to go into another store. 

The light turned green, and I ended my search to focus on driving. The sun was coming in at the worst angle; just low enough that there was no point in even trying the visor. I aimed my eyes towards the pavement and tried to take in my surroundings, half with my peripheral vision. I was only 20 minutes away from home but damnit that just so happens to be the perfect length of time to smoke, take the edge off the day, and mentally prepare for the chaos I was going to walk into at home. Lucy had been with all five kids by herself for now going on 13 hours and was desperately in need of a break herself. This recent good weather was going to make for a nice paycheck, but I hadn't had much energy left to play by the time I get home. 

"That pre-roll would really help on that front. I can't believe I don't have something to light this with"

As I came up to the intersection the light changed from green. 

"Fuck it. I'm stopping on yellow" 

I pulled open the center console, out of sheer stubbornness, and proceeded to rifle through the change and random papers. Another car pulled into the right lane as I spotted my saving grace. 

"Hell yeah! I knew I had something" 

I picked up the branded book of matches I had grabbed from the dispensary on fifth weeks prior. 

"Knew I would need these eventually"

I struck the first match of the book and watched as the satisfying flame guttered for just a second and then caught. I watched as it licked its way towards my fingers and enjoyed the smell of sulfur or phosphorus or whatever it is. With a practiced flick of the wrist, I put out the flame and added the still smoking end of the match to the pile of butts in my ashtray. 

"Cleaned out the whole truck and forgot the ash tray"

The joint stuck just a little uncomfortably to my lip as I spoke. I checked my mirror and the light again. Still red. I tore another match from the book and struck it once, then twice. I flipped it over and tried a third time. The little flicker of flame grew brighter as I brought it to the end of the joint and pulled. As I inhaled, I flicked out the match and placed it on top of the previous one. I looked through my passenger window to see the car that had pulled up beside me and made eye contact with the driver as I held in the hit. Sometimes I think that was the last time I ever inhaled because it feels like I haven't exhaled fully since. 

The car was unremarkable (A Honda something I think) but I will never forget the driver. He was wearing an undone white button down with a white undershirt. The outfit was either new or hardly worn. They had that stiff look of clothes that haven't quite settled around their owner's shoulders. The stark white cuffs of the sleeves contrasted with the gnarled hands of a man who'd spent a life working with them. He had black hair flecked with grey you could only see because of the sun hitting it.  The man had fair skin that wasn't quite pale. The kind that would burn but never tan.   He was fit bordering on underweight, almost gaunt but not weak looking. He appeared, as he looked me eye to eye, to be about the same height as me. 

In those eyes I saw...everything all at once. His eyes were opened to the point of looking like it hurt. Bushy eyebrows so high up his forehead as to seem like they were trying to climb away.  I could see the whites of his eyes all the way around his iris almost bulging outward as he stared. The angle of the sun showed piercing blue that nearly glowed with a manic intensity. a cloud blocked the sun for a moment light made a shadow appear to flicker from inside the neon eyes darkening from blue to black as if reflecting the match I just put out. The corners of his eyes aimed as high as they could but after a lifetime of wear still pointed just ever so slightly downward. like his eyes tried to smile and frown at once. They were eyes that had seen and would see more than could be imagined. Eyes that couldn't ever unsee again. Unmoving, and unblinking, and unreal. Focusing on me as if trying to make me see what they had seen. Reaching out to me like they were trying to force the images they had been shown out of them and into me through sheer force of eye contact. 

I tore my eyes away from those pools of what I knew instantly to be insanity and all of the hairs on my body stood on end. I couldn't look away from the driver though as my eyes simply moved downward to his smile. It was as if his face was longer than human. Like there was more than could be taken in all at once. It was as if I could only deal with one facet of his expression at a time. While his eyes held me, I hadn't seen the grin. His mouth was spread so wide that the edges of it almost touched the creases at the corners of those awful eyes. You could see not only every tooth but black hollows of his cheeks beyond them. Teeth clenched together so tightly the muscles of his jaw writhed like snakes under his skin. An expression that could only technically be called a "smile" because I had no other word for it.

As I tried, unsuccessfully, to look away from the other car, some still rational part of my brain questioned if the light was still red and how long I had been sitting there. Smoke I had forgotten I had pulled in forced its way out and I coughed but still couldn't bring myself to move consciously. I was pinned in place by the smile I could feel more than see through the cloud now in my passenger seat. As the smoke cleared, I saw the man held a book of matches of his own. He struck the match (perfect light on the first try) and simply set it down out of the view of the window. As his white shirt yellowed and darkened I saw he hadn't just put it down. And still he "smiled". As white on white turned to red and brown, he "smiled". As red and brown turned to black, he never stopped "smiling".
