When I was in college, something happened that I’ve never fully been able to explain. It was subtle at first, just a strange undercurrent in the air, as if the universe had momentarily slipped out of alignment. I’ve thought about that day a lot since it happened, wondering if it was a dream, a hallucination, or something else entirely. But it felt real. Too real.

It started off normal enough—or at least, I *thought* it did. I woke up late that morning, groggy from pulling an all-nighter studying for a philosophy exam. My dorm room looked the same as always: the pile of dirty laundry in the corner, the glow of my computer screen in sleep mode, the hum of the mini fridge by the window. But as I stumbled out of bed and began getting dressed, I noticed... small things. The kind of things that wouldn’t normally stand out unless you were paying very close attention. The clock on my wall showed the time—8:14 AM—but the second hand wasn’t moving. It was stuck between two ticks, like a jammed gear. I tapped the clock, thinking it was broken, but as soon as my finger touched the glass, the second hand jumped forward to where it should have been, as if catching up all at once. I thought it was weird but shrugged it off.

That was only the first odd thing that day.

The second was when I left the dorm building. It was sunny out, but the light felt... off. It was too bright, the shadows too sharp. Everything seemed *too* vivid, almost as if the saturation on the world had been cranked up a little too high. The air smelled faintly metallic, like a thunderstorm was about to break, but the sky was clear, and the sun burned hot overhead. I noticed people around me—students walking to class, bikers zipping by on the path—but they all seemed strangely mechanical, like puppets on invisible strings. The way they moved felt unnatural, too precise. Their eyes looked vacant, as if they were going through the motions of being human without understanding what that meant.

It unsettled me, but I kept walking toward the main campus, brushing it off as fatigue or stress. I figured I was just overtired and my brain was misfiring.

The third thing happened when I reached the dining hall. I stopped by for a quick coffee before class, hoping caffeine would snap me out of whatever funk I was in. The barista greeted me with a smile—except it wasn’t a real smile. It stretched across his face like a mask, showing far too many teeth, all perfectly white and identical. His eyes, however, remained cold and empty, like two polished stones. When he handed me my coffee, I could swear his fingers were *too* long. They wrapped all the way around the cup in a way that shouldn’t have been possible, joints bending slightly backward.

I didn’t say anything. I just took the coffee, gave a nervous laugh, and left.

I felt a growing sense of unease as I made my way to class. There was a quiet hum in the background of the world, a sound just on the edge of perception. It reminded me of the hum an old TV makes when it’s left on with no picture—barely audible, but enough to set your nerves on edge. I tried to shake it off, telling myself it was nothing, but the farther I walked, the more I started to feel like I was out of place. Like a single wrong note in a song that no one else could hear.

I reached the classroom just in time for my psychology lecture. It was one of those large, tiered lecture halls, with seats arranged in a half-circle around the front podium. I slid into a seat near the back, cradling my coffee like it was the only thing keeping me tethered to reality. The professor, Dr. Mills, was already mid-lecture, his voice droning on about the mechanics of behavioral conditioning. I let his words wash over me, not really paying attention. I was too distracted by the strange feeling that had followed me all morning.

And that’s when it happened.

At first, everything seemed normal—or at least, as normal as things had been that day. Dr. Mills stood at the front of the room, gesturing occasionally as he explained some point or another. The other students around me were taking notes or zoning out, same as always. I tried to focus on the lecture, but my mind kept drifting. Something felt *off*, and I couldn’t put my finger on what it was.

Then Dr. Mills stopped talking.

Not in the way a professor pauses to collect their thoughts or check their notes. It was as if someone had hit the pause button on him mid-sentence. His mouth was still slightly open, lips frozen in the shape of a word that never came out. His arm, mid-gesture, hung suspended in the air. The chalk in his hand hovered inches from the blackboard, as if time had simply... stopped for him.

I stared, confused, waiting for him to continue. But he didn’t move. He just stood there, perfectly still.

And then—slowly, *so* slowly—he turned his head to look directly at me.

At first, I thought it was a coincidence. Maybe he had just noticed me out of the corner of his eye, or maybe I’d moved in a way that caught his attention. But the way he turned—*mechanically*, *deliberately*, as if on a pivot—made my skin crawl. His eyes locked onto mine, wide and unblinking. There was something unnatural about the way he stared at me, as if he were seeing me for the first time. As if I were... out of place.

I tried to look away, but I couldn’t. It was like his gaze had hooked into me, pinning me to my seat. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck rise, a cold wave of fear washing over me.

And then, one by one, every other student in the room turned to stare at me, too.

It wasn’t fast. It was slow, methodical, like a series of dominos falling in perfect sequence. First the student to my left. Then the one to my right. Then the ones in front of me, and behind me, until every single person in that room—dozens of them—were turned in their seats, facing me with the same wide-eyed, unblinking stare. None of them moved. None of them spoke. They just... *looked* at me, as if waiting for something.

The silence was unbearable. It stretched on and on, pressing against my ears like the weight of deep water. I could hear my own heartbeat, loud and frantic in my chest. I wanted to scream, to ask what the hell was happening, but my voice wouldn’t come. I was frozen, trapped in that awful, staring silence.

And then—just as suddenly as it began—it ended.

Dr. Mills turned back to the blackboard as if nothing had happened. He picked up right where he’d left off, mid-sentence, as though the past minute of silence hadn’t existed. The students around me did the same, turning back to their notes and laptops without a word, as if nothing had happened. The hum in the background—the one I hadn’t even realized was gone—returned, faint and persistent.

I sat there, numb and disoriented, trying to make sense of what I’d just experienced. But no one else seemed to notice anything strange. It was as if I had slipped into a different reality for a moment—just long enough to catch a glimpse of something I wasn’t supposed to see—before being unceremoniously dropped back into the ordinary world.

The rest of the day passed uneventfully. The strange sense of wrongness that had haunted me all morning gradually faded, and by the time I went to bed that night, everything felt normal again.

I never told anyone about what happened. How could I? It sounded crazy, like the ramblings of someone who had lost their grip on reality. But it happened. I know it did.

In all the years since, I’ve never experienced anything like it again. Life went on. I graduated, got a job, moved to a new city. The world remained solid and predictable, the way it’s supposed to be.

But sometimes, late at night, when I’m lying in bed staring at the ceiling, I think about that day. I think about the way Dr. Mills turned to look at me, his eyes wide and empty. I think about the silence that pressed down on me, and the way every person in that room had stared at me as if I were something... *wrong*.

And I wonder.

I wonder if, just for a moment, I had slipped through the cracks in reality. If I had seen something I wasn’t supposed to see.

And I wonder if, someday, it will happen again.
