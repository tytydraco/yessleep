The internet has always fascinated me.

I remember when I was younger I loved watching videos on YouTube. I don’t know, but I was obsessed with UFO’s and stop motion Lego videos. It was really an interesting time for me. But as time passed on, I lost interest in these things, and I started watching different stuff. And that was the point that I realized that the internet was not a „fun place“, it was the opposite of that. In that time period I saw a lot of things I never thought I would see on YouTube, but I once saw something, that stuck with me to this very day, and I think about it all the time. One night I stumbled on a YouTube channel called CollosalCarnage08, and I didn’t think much about it. The channel was ran by a girl called Chloe, she was from the UK, and I don’t know why, but she had a good vibe, she was good looking, funny, charismatic and overall seemed to be a nice person. But I noticed that all of her videos were uploaded a long time ago, (10+ years) and curious I decided to check her comments. In 2010 after posting her last video, Chloe committed suicide by hanging. She was 17 years old. And after that I looked up her name and I found 3-4 articles that confirmed her death. But something wasn’t right. All the time the news articles mentioned trolls, and so did the YouTube comments, and one name stood out: **Brentsey.**

Curious, I started to research that name.

Doing a google search lead to nothing.

But after reading  the comments on Chloe’s video, people were mentioning this name. People were furious with him, criticizing him and so on.

I tried to search him up on YouTube, but it lead to nothing.

And then finally, I decided to search up his name via The Wayback Machine, and it all made sense.

This guy, he was a troll. He was a member of a group called „The Wack Pack“ (the term Wack Pack was made popular because it was an assortment of personalities heard throughout the history of The Howard Stern Show) which was active in the early days of YouTube. Now this guy, along with his best friend/cousin **TatianaSword** had a fetish for trolling. But it wasn’t your normal trolling. These guys would go find videos related to a deceased person, and they would write comments targeting the deceased person or their family/friends. And believe it or not, they did their damage. Outraged family members/friends would retaliate against them, they would fight back and so on and so on. Their era was from 2009 to 2011/12, after that all of their accounts were removed because people reported them. Sure, they were banned before, but they came back.

These guys were from the U.S., and the had a cult following. There were people who supported them, who did what they told them to do, creating an avalanche of trolls. They didn’t care who they trolled, age wasn’t important, religion wasn’t important, country, nothing. They were scum.

Poor Chloe was also a victim of their trolling. Before and after her death, there were troll comments from these guys. They went to such lengths that after Chloe’s death they targeted the tribute site made for her, and they also targeted her mother.

Time passed by, but Brentsey didn’t give up. He was set on tormenting Chloe, leaving all kinds of comments on her channel, and not stopping. But, it all faded away, when his account was banned, the comments disappeared .

But there was one question left. Who were these guys? How’s it possible that they inflicted so much pain to other people and simply just disappeared into thin air. No one was held accountable for these things, sure, the police were involved, but nothing of importance was done. These guys did their thing and they simply disappeared, and are 100% free people without a care in the world.

Who knows, maybe one day, these guys will be found.
