“Are you out of your mind?” I nearly shouted. “It was you and two big goons! You dragged me here from cell three and abandoned me!”

The lady cop looked at me coldly. “If you don’t get yourself under control I’m going to taze you again.”

I clenched my fists and teeth and took a slow, deep breath. “Do you seriously not remember me at all?” I asked with a growl in my voice, but at least my volume was controlled.

She snorted derisively. “I have no idea who you are. We’ve never met.”

Another officer arrived just then. “Everything alright here?” he asked the lady cop.

“Yeah,” she replied. “This guy is trying to convince me that I’m the one who put him in this room. He seems delusional to me. Think maybe we should get him evaluated?”

“Psychologically?” he asked.

“What for?” I interrupted. “I didn’t cuff myself and put myself in here to rot. And I didn’t taze myself after I told you I needed to pee. Would one of you bring me a clean pair of pants at least?”

Both cops looked down and their noses twitched with disgust as they saw the large, dark wet spot in my pants. The guy cop said, “You wait here. I’ll go get this guy some fresh pants.”

The lady cop nodded and he left. “When he gets back, you change, and we’re going to have a chat about what you’re really doing here. And no gaslighting me and telling me I put you here!”

“Whatever,” I grumbled as I rolled my eyes. “Let’s see if that guy forgets to come back like everyone else seems to be doing today.”

The lady cop snorted at this, relaxed a bit, and leaned back against the wall. And we waited.

And waited.

And waited.

After ten minutes passed, she suddenly lost her patience. She keyed the mic on her radio. “Cochran!” she demanded. “What’s the holdup?”

The reply came a few seconds later. “What are you on about Valdez?” officer Cochran replied.

“Very funny Cochran,” officer Valdez replied derisively. “You decided to mess with me so I think this guy’s cock-and-bull story is true?”

“I honestly have no idea what you mean,” came the reply.

The lady cop, officer Valdez, shook her head in frustration. “What size waist are you?” she asked me.

“Thirty-six,” I answered.

She keyed the mic again. “Cochran, quit messing around and bring a pair of thirty-six-inch waist pants to interrogation two ASAP!”

The radio crackled and something unintelligible came though, then it was back to the waiting game. But this time it was only a couple of minutes and Officer Cochran returned with a fresh pair of pants for me.

“Hey, who’s this guy?” He asked, jerking his thumb at me.

“No idea,” she answered. “Just toss him the pants so he can change out.”

Cochran complied, and the pants hit me in the face, one leg whipping around like a scarf and coming to rest on my shoulder.

“Mind looking away while I change?” I asked.

“Yes!” they replied in unison, then Valdez took over. “It’s policy. We have to have eyes on you at all times so you don’t pull any funny business.”

I disrobed from the waist down with both cops watching and slipped into the fresh pants, full commando style. “Thanks,” I said as I zipped and buttoned them up.

Officer Valdez pointed to the chair on the far end of the table. “Now sit. Let’s have a chat.”

I did as I was told. “What do you want to know?” I asked as I settled in for what I knew was going to be an extremely annoying interrogation. “I asked for a lawyer hours ago. You expect me to talk to you without one?”

Officer Valdez replied, “We’re not interrogating you,” she said coolly. “We don’t know what we’d interrogate you for. What we need to know is who are you and what you’re doing here.”

Officer Cochran got a confused look on his face. “Wait,” he said. “We don’t know why this guy’s cuffed and in an interrogation room?”

Officer Valdez visibly lost her temper. “Oh my God!” she snapped. “You were here! You know we don’t know who this guy is or why he’s here. We don’t know how long he’s been here. All we know is he’s here, and he keeps saying I’m the one who put him here, which can’t possibly be true because I’d know it if I did!”

Turning to me, she demanded “What’s your name? I’m going to have booking look you up.”

I shook my head in disbelief. “My name’s.” I answered honestly. Of course, it isn’t taking to print, but I said it to them out loud, and they heard me.

Officer Valdez keyed her mic again. “Booking, pull our file a mister,” she said my name perfectly. A reply in the affirmative came through in response.

We waited for a few minutes, then booking radioed in. “We don’t have anyone with that name on file.” They said. “He must be lying about his name.”

I’d had enough. “Bullshit! My name is! Why can’t you people find me? Why can’t you remember me? I was booked this morning for supposedly stealing my own damn car, a car I bought in cash by the way! It’s been registered in my name for two years! Until today I’ve never even had as much as a speeding ticket, and now look at me! I’m locked up, in chains, and none of you even know who I am!”

I was so upset my ears started ringing. Maybe that’s why I didn’t hear whatever was said. But whatever it was, it must have been important, because the next thing I knew, I was being held down in my seat as my arms were yanked forward and the chain on my cuffs was locked into a restraining ring built into the table.

“Get psych here,” officer Valdez commanded to person on the other end of the radio. This guy’s definitely either crazy or wants us to think he is. Let’s get him an inpatient evaluation.”

Cochran Scoffed. “If it’s an inpatient evaluation, he needs to go to the hospital. No need to keep him here where we have to be responsible for his well-being.”

Officer Valdez nodded. “You’re right. You drive him to the asylum. The sooner we get him out of here and either get him to quit messing around, or find our if he’s really nuts, the better.” She keyed her mic. “Send some backup to interrogation two to assist in transporting an uncooperative suspect.”

With that, there was no waiting for the psychiatrist. Instead, several more officers showed up, and the group of them made sure I was completely restrained as they dragged me outside, shoved me into the back seat of a squad car, and slammed the door.

“Take him straight to the hospital,” officer Valdez told officer Cochran. “I’m going to check today’s mugshots and see if I can’t find out who this guy really is before I fax over the paperwork. Doctor Hildebrand will need to know who his patient is.”

Officer Cochran settled into the driver’s seat and looked at me in the rearview mirror. “You’re something else buddy,” he chuckled. “It’s rare for someone to get under Valdez’s skin like that. Doctor Hildebrand is going to love you.”

\*\*\*\*

The drive to the mental hospital took a solid forty-five minutes with the city traffic. Officer Cochran chatted at me the entire drive, not caring if I had anything to say in return, only what was coming out of his own mouth. I grew to despise him in that time. I never liked people who monopolize conversations or prattle on endlessly just to hear themselves talk. Nothing he said was worth remembering or repeating until we got to the asylum.

“Time for you to hop down the booby hatch buddy!” he joked as he opened the door and let me out. “I’m going to give you some advice. Here, they don’t use handcuffs. They use straight jackets and padded rooms. Don’t get physical unless you want up in those. Also, if you’re screwing with us just to avoid being charged with your crime, you better fess up. The doctor has the authority to keep you locked up here for as long as it takes to declare you mentally fit. Even if it takes the rest of your life. No Judge. No trial. Just confinement according to Doctor Hildebrand’s best judgement.”

I stared my captor in the eyes. “How much do you want to bet your friend Valdez never sent the paperwork?”

He laughed at this. “Valdez never forgets a thing,” he chortled. “The paperwork will be done, faxed, and waiting. So, again, I know you criminal types think that insanity is a good deal compared to guilty, but it’s really much worse. At least a prison has a set end date, and most everyone gets out early. Insanity keeps you locked up until the doctor decides you aren’t crazy anymore.”

I shook my head at this. “I’m not guilty, and I’m not crazy. And I didn’t break into your police station. And I haven’t lied to you. I’m as confused by what’s happening as you are skeptical. None of it makes a lick of sense!”

Officer Cochran shook his head and chuckled some more. “You stick with that story, and I promise you’ll have a long stay in the booby hatch. You’re right that it doesn’t make any sense. That’s why nobody believes you, and nobody will believe you. But I’ll tell you what I think is really going on here.”

“This should be rich,” I gruffly interrupted.

He continued unfazed. “I think you’re just another lowlife who can’t make it out in the real world, and you’re looking for three hots and a cot at the taxpayer’s expense. I think you absolutely stole this car you keep ranting about, and that you’re only pretending to be delusional because you think that being locked up in an asylum is preferable to being locked up in a prison. Still, you want to be locked up, so you’re going to go through with this, and after you’ve been hit hard enough by the reality of confinement in a mental hospital, you’ll come clean and beg to go to prison.”

I laughed ruefully at the absolute absurdity of his claim. “Do you even know who I am? I’m. I run -.com, one of the top five news websites in the world! I’m worth more than everyone in your stupid police department combined many times over! I don’t need shit from you or the taxpayer! I can buy your stupid police station in cash and kick you all out to work in phone booth!”

He laughed again, mockingly. “Sure thing buddy. You’re some lowlife no one ever heard from who made a fortune running some website that doesn’t exist. Here, let me dispel your illusion.”

He pulled the car over and parked on the shoulder of the road. Then he pulled out his phone and typed out the web domain I gave to him in his Google search bar and showed me the results. “See that?” he said with a sense of finality. “It doesn’t exist. No search results. Nothing. Nada. So drop the act. Nobody is ever going to believe you. You’re a liar, and a bad one at that.”

He put the car in gear and merged back into traffic. “You might as well settle down and figure out what story you want to tell Dr. Hildebrand. It’s going to decide your life for the foreseeable future.

\*\*\*\*

 

 Modern mental hospitals defy popular expectations. Hollywood loves the image of a massive, looming, threatening building surrounded by walls and barbed wire, like a maximum-security prison. The truth is that almost no mental hospitals meet this description. Maybe none, not even the ones for the murderously insane. They have a veneer of pleasant respectability, and the high security stuff tends to be hidden from the eyes of the public. This one was no different.

The front was a clean, white box of a building with windows and awnings. The lawn was lush, manicured, and bordered by hedges of flowering shrubs. Officer Cochran pulled into a parking space reserved for law enforcement, noticed a car illegally parked in a handicapped spot, and actually took the time to write out a parking ticket before letting me out of the squad car.

“I don’t have to call in and have the staff here strap you down to a gurney and wheel you in, do I?” he asked seriously.

“I’ll cooperate,” I replied crankily, shaking my cuffed wrists. “It’s not like I can Houdini my out of these even if I managed to get away.”

He had me walk ahead of him to the front door, which slid open automatically as we approached, marched me to the reception desk, and announced our presence to the lady behind it.

“Here’s the patient Officer Valdez sent the intake paperwork for,” he declared. “Mr., or so he claims.”

The receptionist looked puzzled. “We didn’t get any intake paperwork from your department today,” she stated. “Is he here for an inpatient or outpatient evaluation?

Officer Cochran looked surprised for a moment. He turned his head and gave me an appraising stare as if to say “*How did this guy know the paperwork wouldn’t be here?*”, then turned back to the receptionist. “Inpatient,” he replied in a tone that masked any misgivings he may have had. “The fax machine must have malfunctioned. I’ll do the paperwork right here and Dr. Hildebrand can get started.”

The receptionist gave him the paperwork to fill out, picked up the desk phone, and called Dr. Hildebrand to let him know that he had an intake evaluation. I watched closely as the cop filled out every line and space. Every word, every letter, every number stuck to the page. When he was done he turned the small stack of papers around and slid them across the counter to the receptionist. She took a cursory glance at them and waved over a tall male orderly in blue scrubs. “Take Mr. to see Dr. Hildebrand,” She instructed. “Priority legal mental evaluation.”

The orderly replied with a surly grunt that spoke volumes about how his day was going. Officer Cochran uncuffed me and wished me luck, but the mocking tone he’d had the whole drive over was gone, as if the lack of intake paperwork when we arrived was giving him second thoughts about my story, then he turned and walked out of the hospital, and out of my life.

I wasn’t given time to think much on this turn of events as the orderly directed to a solid wooden door that buzzed open ahead of us as we approached. We passed through and entered into the office wing of the asylum, where the doctors met with patients, and the records were meticulously kept. Each door was solid wood with secure locks and reinforced tempered glass windows in the upper third. The purpose of each room was stenciled on the upper section of the glass in white paint.

We stopped in front of one with Dr. Hildebrand’s name stenciled on it. The orderly tugged on the lanyard around his neck, pulled his pass card out from under his shirt, and pressed it up to the RFID reader next to the door. It buzzed, there was a click, and he opened the door.

Dr. Hildebrand’s office looked like every stereotype of an overeducated psychologist ever. There was two large bookshelves on the far wall loaded with textbooks, academic journals, and pop psychology books. His diplomas and certifications were framed and hung on the wall directly behind the large, oaken desk, in between the bookshelves. In front of the desk were a couple of chairs and a couch.

Dr. Hildebrand himself was seated behind the desk in a large, overstuffed office chair. He was a small, weaselly looking man with thinning hair and a hipster goatee. He looked at me appraisingly. “Who are you?” he asked.

“Oh my God!” I griped as I put my head in my hands. “My name is. And I’m here because the police think I’m either crazy, or lying, and they want you to find out which.”

The doctor snorted derisively. “You’d think they would have at least filled out the proper paperwork before simply dumping you in my lap. Come inside and take a seat., then tell me everything according to your point of view”

The orderly closed the door behind me as I stepped inside the office. I heard it latch and the electronic lock engage. I sat down on the couch simply because it looked more comfortable than either of the two chairs that were available to me. Then I spilled my guts. I told the doctor everything from the moment I woke up to discover that everything I built had been simply erased from existence, to my arrest, my time in the jail and the interrogation room, and all about how everyone who met me seemed to forget me as soon as they left the room.

“I don’t get it. I don’t understand why everyone forgets me. I don’t know exactly when they forget me, or why. It just seems like once I’m out of sight, I’m out of mind. Literally.”

Dr. Hildebrand listened to me talk over steepled fingers as he leaned forward. He looked like he was deep in thought, which, as far as psychiatrists are concerned, probably isn’t a good thing. They tend to take complex issues and diagnose them, which was exactly what I didn’t need at the time.

“That sounds like quite the elaborate delusion,” he said thoughtfully. “Too elaborate. It stinks of deception. Either that, or a deep break with reality.”

“Oh, come on!” I wailed. “I need someone to believe me! Everyone thinks I’m crazy or a liar! Nobody gives me a moment of credibility, then they leave the room and forget that I even exist! Think about it! The cops never sent you the paperwork. The cop who dropped me off filled out the paperwork at the reception desk, but she never sent it to you. If you look for it, it’s probably going to be as blank as my library card application was, but that won’t matter because your receptionist won’t have the slightest idea who the hell I am or remember ever seeing me!”

Dr. Hildebrand leaned back in his chair. “Paperwork errors happen all the time without the need for some unexplainable force of erasure dogging your every step. People get busy and forget things all the time, including other people they recently met. There is a natural explanation for everything that happened to you, and part of the explanation is the delusion within your own mind.”

“The delusion?” I cried incredulously.

“Yes, the delusion,” he replied calmly. “If everything you said here is true as far as you know, the most likely explanation is that you are not who you think you are. You built up an entire life that never existed in your own mind, and along the way you came to believe it. All we need to do is assist you with finding your true self. Or, and this is less likely, something traumatic happened, and you developed a severe form of dissociative identity disorder, DID for short. One so severe that your personalities are not even aware of each other. Either way, you need help, and this is the right place for you to get it.”

I couldn’t believe my ears.  Sure, my story was unbelievable. Hell, I didn’t even believe it. But to be so casually diagnosed as some sort of psychotic who can’t tell fantasy from reality hurt me deeply.

“Thanks for nothing doc,” I sneered. “Here I need help getting my life back, and instead I get a bullshit diagnosis. Thank you so very much . . . pompous ass!”

He was unfazed. “Insults will get you nowhere here. But we will get you your life back. We’re just going to do it with science. Not some voodoo nonsense that only exists in your own mind. Some rest, and a regimen of therapy and anti-psychotic drugs should do you a world of good.”

Before I could protest, he pushed an intercom buzzer on his desk. “We’re done here. Please take the patient to room 5C. He won’t need restraints, but he needs to be where he can’t hurt himself.”

Moments later the door buzzed open and the same orderly that brought me to the doctor came in the room accompanied by another, obviously to ensure that I could be overpowered if I freaked out and fought them.

Alright, look. I know that movies are all cock-and-bull where reality gets dialed down so they can dial up the drama, but I wasn’t about to chance provoking mental asylum staff. Even if they didn’t shoot me up full of knock-out drugs, put me in a straight jacket, strap me down to a gurney, and electrocute my brain until I was a drooling mess for life, I had no desire to find out how close to that outcome they might take me in reality. So I went along quietly.

“Do you know who I am?” I asked the original orderly as we walked down the hallway.

“Sure I do,” he replied. “You’re the patient I’m escorting to a nice, padded room for a long stay here.”

“No,” I shot back. “I mean do you remember bringing me to see the doctor earlier?”

He chuckled ruefully. “Buddy, I bring so many to see the doctor that they all kind of blur together. So if you say I brought you, then I guess I did, but I don’t remember you at all. You’re not that special.”

I shook my head at the uselessness of his answer. Then I saw a drinking fountain on the wall, and remembered that I was parched, not having had a drop to drink since I was first thrown into the interrogation room back at the police station.

I asked for permission to get a drink, and they let me. The water felt like a cool touch of paradise as it struck my lips. It soothed my burning throat as I drunk greedily, filling my belly with cool, crisp tap water. Then I thanked the orderlies and went the rest of my way to the room in silence.

The orderlies guided me though the door. Pointing to one corner, the new one informed me that the toilet and wash station was designed to run automatically so that there was nothing but minimal hygiene utility to minimize any risk of harming myself.

The reality of being in an asylum, at least so far, was not one of wantonly cruel people exploiting positions of special trust and power to torment others. I have no doubt that it happens, and it used to be more the rule than the exception in the unenlightened past. But I experienced none of it that day.

The orderlies went to close the door and I stopped them. “Thank you,” I said “for being kind to me. Just please promise me one thing.”

They both looked at me, eyebrows arched questioningly.

“Promise me that you won’t forget me.”

They both smiled and gave a light chuckle. Sure buddy,” one of them replied. “We won’t forget you. It’s our job to make sure you’re taken care of.”

Then he shut the door and never came back.

\*\*\*\*

The next two weeks were torture. Out of sight, out of mind ruled my life, and since I was out of sight, I was on nobody’s mind. Nobody came to bring me food. Nobody came to do a wellness check. Nobody heard me when I pounded on the padded, soundproof walls and door. Nobody heard me scream for help, to be let out, to please, please don’t leave me there to starve to death.

The one grace I had was the sink and toilet. I could relieve myself and the seatless steel toilet, like the kind you see in prisons, would flush itself. I could cup my hands under the sink faucet and fill them with water to drink. Two parts of the rule of fours were taken care of. Four minutes without air? No worries. The room was properly ventilated. Four days without water? Also no problem, as long as the sink kept working. Hell, even if it quit working, it was only a matter of time before I got thirsty enough to drink toilet water. Thankfully, it never came to that.

Four weeks without food though, that was another thing. There was no food in my cell. No way to call for food, and no automatic food dispenser. I was slowly starving, and there was nothing I could do about it other than wait and hope that they might open my door for some reason, any reason.

I was getting thin and weak. My face looked drawn and haggard, an unkempt beard filling in over my thinning features. My hands began to shake periodically, revving up at random before settling back down to normal. I was tired all the time. My mind slowed. When I stood up, I had to be careful and do it slowly, or else I would get lightheaded and come near to fainting.

Worse even than the hunger was the abject loneliness. Humans are social creatures, and solitude, while good in small doses, becomes deeply destructive to our minds as it draws out for longer periods of time.

I was more alone than anyone else in the world at that time. Not only was I locked away in solitary confinement without a hint of company or a scrap of food to eat, but I was also forgotten by the entire world. No one missed me. No one was worried about me. No one cared if I lived or died. No one even knew that I existed at all.

This was the truth that sunk in as I wasted away in that padded cell. I was forgotten, and I would always be forgotten. I was a non-person. Somehow erased from history and humanity by a company that had control over the information of the world.

What eldritch power was Google in league with that it could erase all trace of someone’s existence? What gave them the reality bending power render someone into some kind of living phantom, here one minute, gone from all memory as soon as people moved on?

What about my parents and my brother? Did they remember me at least? Was there any possibility that they noticed my absence? Or even if they couldn’t remember me, did they at least have a sense of something truly important missing from their lives? Would they remember me if they saw me, even if I’ve been forgotten for now?

These questions, and many more like them plagued me during my solitude. With no one to talk to, and no one to care, all I had were my own thoughts. With nothing to anchor me to reality outside of four white padded walls, a toilet, and a sink, my mind whirled in whatever direction it chose, and I obsessed over my own situation. My own thoughts ran away from me at warp speed, and I could neither catch them nor control them.

I drifted in and out of wakefulness, losing all sense of time. After a time, I know not how long, I gave up calling for help in every form. It was hopeless. I was hopeless, and I was consigned to my fate. To starve to death in this safety cell only to one day have my decayed remains discovered when the hospital staff had occasion to open the cell.

Then one day, salvation came in the form of a raving lunatic.

The door to my cell opened, and two orderlies that I didn’t recognize roughly dragged a struggling man in a strait jacket into the room. He screamed. He cursed. He kicked, bit, and spit. Then he saw me and screamed anew in absolute terror.

“A creature!” he screamed. “There’s a creature in this room! Don’t leave me here with it!”

The orderlies fought with him some more and managed to get him at least somewhat under control. It was only then when one of them finally looked my way and yelped in shock. I was certainly a sight to behold. Thin, unshaven, hair unkempt, red, watery eyes, chipped and broken fingernails, and reeking for lack of a bath in two weeks’ time.

“Who are you and what are you doing here!” he demanded.

“My name is.” I replied weakly. “I was put in here I don’t know how long ago and left to starve to death. Please, take me to Dr. Hildebrand.” I begged pitifully. “Just don’t leave me alone. I’m afraid I’ll be forgotten if I’m left alone again.”

One of the orderlies helped me get to my feet and escorted me out of the room while the other one made sure the violent, screaming man in the strait jacket was secured in the room. The one who helped me pressed an intercom button on the wall and spoke into it. “Dr. Hildebrand, please go to your office. We found an unknown man in room 5C. He’s in rough shape. It looks like he’s been in there untended for quite some time.”

The orderlies helped me walk to Dr. Hildebrand’s office and sat me down on his couch. A few moments later, the doctor himself stepped in and gasped at the sight of me. He had the orderlies fill him in on the details of how they found me and sent them out the door.

Forgoing his place behind his desk, he pulled one of the other chairs up close. “Who are you?” he asked seriously.

“My name is.” I replied with resignation, knowing my name would mean nothing to him by now. “You had me put in that room . . . what day is it?”

He told me the day.

“Two weeks ago, and then everyone forgot about me. In fact, people forgetting about me is why you put me there. You didn’t believe me.”

Dr. Hildebrand didn’t know whether to be incensed or worried. “I didn’t put you in that room,” he insisted. “I would remember if I had, and I certainly would not have left you isolated and starving for two weeks if I had either! It’s inhumane, and I would lose my license.”

I narrowed my eyes at him. “That fact remains that that’s exactly what you did. I don’t belong here, and I’m willing to bet that there’s no record of me ever being admitted.”

Now it was the good doctor’s turn to be indignant. “We would never be so careless! If I put you in that room there must be a file on you!”

“Prove it,” I challenged. “But whatever you do, don’t leave this room. Don’t leave me alone and forgotten again.”

“You are not the one in charge here!” the doctor declared indignantly. “I’m going to step out of this room, go across the hall, and find your file. Then we’re going to get to the bottom of how my staff neglected you for you for two weeks and take appropriate action.”

Something inside me snapped at this point. The wall of indignance and pride that had sustained me broke, and any sense of entitlement I had, every shred of dignity that I had been stubbornly clinging to was washed away in a flood of panic.

‘No!” I screamed desperately. “Don’t do that! If you leave, you’re going to forget me and then I’ll be trapped again! Look at me! You forgot me last time and it’s nearly killed me! Last time you saw me I was clean and robust. Now look at me! I won’t survive if you leave me alone again!”

I lunged at the doctor and fell to my knees. I grabbed him by the wrist and pulled it into my chest with both hands, grasping him with a strength I should not have had, but was borne of terror at the thought of being left to starve and rot yet again. “Don’t leave me alone! I need you to remember me!”

The doctor used his free hand to hit a red button on a device pinned to his jacket lapel. Moments later two orderlies burst into the room and dragged me off of him as I screamed and begged not to be left alone again. I could feel in my core that I was going to suffer the same fate as I had after my fist time in dr. Hildebrand’s office, ordered tossed into a padded cell, probably in a strait jacket this for my hysterics, where I would again be forgotten and left to waste away in grim solitude.

My salvation came in the form of a question.

“Where did this guy come from?” one of the orderlies asked.

This caught Dr. Hildebrand’s attention. “You don’t know this man?” he asked seriously.

“Never seen him before in my life,” the orderly replied. “Frankly, I thought you were off doing your scheduled rounds. You didn’t even have anyone on standby in case this patient got violent. You know that’s protocol with new patients doc.”

The doctor’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully. “You didn’t bring him here from room 5C?” he asked.

The orderly scoffed. “Definitely not! I’d remember a scruffy hobo like him, especially if I had to drag him halfway across the hospital.”

Dr. Hildebrand raised one hand and fixed his stare at me. “If I have them let go of you, I need you to calm down and take a seat, understand?”

I didn’t really understand. My mind was possessed with a singular focus on just not being left alone again. Still, I nodded, eyes wide in panic, wondering what the doctor had planned.

He turned his attention back to the orderlies. “Let him go,” he ordered, then turned his attention back to me.

I shakily took my seat. It was only then that I noticed the tears running down my cheeks, and the snot bubbling out of my nose.

The doctor offered me a tissue and I accepted. I wiped my face and blew my nose, and we repeated the process for another four tissues until I was all cleaned up.

“You good?” he asked me.

I nodded in the affirmative.

He addressed the orderlies at this. “I want you two to go outside my office, close the door, wait five minutes, and come back in here” He pulled a digital timer out of his desk, set it for five minutes, then handed it to one of the orderlies. “So you don’t forget,” he stated coolly.

The orderlies both gave him an incredulous look. One pocketed the timer, shrugged, and they left the room, the door clicking and latching securely behind them.

“It’s time to dispel your delusion,” he told me plainly. ”Hank seems to not remember bringing you in here earlier. But maybe my memory is faulty and it was someone else. Either way, when that timer goes off, those two are going to come back in here, and you’ll see that you’re suffering from paranoid delusions. Then we’ll give you the help you really need.”

I shook my head in denial. “No, they won’t,” I contradicted. “They never do. They never will. But you . . . you can’t see it. You think I’m crazy, that I belong here under your care. And maybe I do need your care. I definitely need help, but not the kind that you can give me. Not that anyone can give me.”

“I can definitely give you the help you need,” the doctor answered compassionately. “But first we need to get this all sorted out, and it starts in,” he checked his watch, “four minutes.”

The four minutes passed in silence, and the orderlies failed to return. The doctor looked concerned. “They may have been called off for a patient emergency.” He speculated. “Let’s wait a few more minutes.”

A few more minutes passed, then a few more, and a few more. Finally, after an additional twenty minutes passed in tense silence, Dr. Hildebrand pushed the intercom button. “Hank, report to my office immediately,” he commanded.

The reply was quick. “Right away,” Hank’s voice crackled from the speaker.

Hank arrived in the office a couple minutes later.

“Where were you?” Dr. Hildebrand asked.

“What do you mean?” Hank asked incredulously. “I was helping the pharmacy dispense the afternoon meds like I’m supposed to.”

Dr. Hildebrand’s expression changed from one of confident annoyance to one of disturbed concern. “Why didn’t you come back here like I told you to?” he asked.

Hank scoffed. “You never did that doc,” he replied. “You sure you didn’t tell one of the other orderlies to do that.”

“Check your pocket,” the doctor ordered.

Hank did as he was told and pulled out the timer. The face was blank, and he looked at it with a confused expression.

“How did this get in there?” he asked incredulously.

Dr. Hildebrand’s eyes widened at this, but he held his thought back. “Leave it on my desk and return to your duties,” he ordered.

The orderly obeyed, and soon it was just me and the doctor again.

“He forgot me,” I stated flatly. “It’s like I told you. They always forget me.”

Dr. Hildebrand was fixated on the blank timer. He pulled up the settings and saw that the timer was set for sixty minutes. “I know I set it for five minutes,” he murmured.

“Devices forget me too,” I informed him. “So does paper, video, everyone and everything. I don’t know why, or how, but it’s like I’m not allowed to impact the world in any way. Like I exist, but I also don’t exist.”

“That’s impossible,” the doctor insisted.

“I know,” I replied resignedly. “But I’ve just had a whole two weeks alone with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company. What do you think I thought about the most? This problem . . . it . . . defies explanation, but I can’t deny that I’m living it.”

The doctor shook his head skeptically. “It can’t be,” he stated resolutely. “You were in one of our patient rooms, so unless you somehow managed to break into it, which I seriously doubt you could do and not be able to escape, there must be a record of you here somewhere!”

I signed in frustration. “If I wasn’t living it myself, I wouldn’t believe me either. Look for the records. Just, whatever you do, don’t leave me. Stay with me or else you’re going to forget me again. Promise me that you’ll stay with me!”

The doctor thought about it for a moment. “Okay,” he said. “Even though what you claim is impossible, you obviously believe it. Leaving you alone would put undue stress on you.”

Dr. Hildebrand spent the next hour having the staff search high and low for any record of me, getting intensely frustrated whenever he checked in with someone only for them to deny ever having heard of me. He even called the police station to check my story only to have them deny ever having heard of me. His frustration grew with every failure, with every forgotten meeting.

“It maddening, isn’t it doc?” I asked once I could see that he was at his wit’s end and fully wound up with frustration. “I’m right here. You can see me, hear me, smell my unwashed body, but I don’t exist outside of this room. It makes no earthly sense at all, does it?”

The doctor did an admirable job controlling himself. “No. It doesn’t.” he agreed. “So what to do about this situation?”

I looked him square in the eye and leaned forward. “It’s as you said. Leaving me in that room untended for two weeks, left to starve without a care would cost you your license, not to mention the scandal the hospital would endure. But that not entirely true. I couldn’t file a lawsuit or expose you to the media if I tried. Nobody would remember, and the records would vanish. The truth is, you could toss me away anywhere and leave me to rot, and nobody would know the difference.”

He blanched at this.

“All I want is for you to walk to the cafeteria with me, have a meal with me, and walk me right out the front door and out of your life forever. No muss, no fuss. Just feed me and forget me.”

The doctor thought for a moment. “It would be cruel to send you out into the world hungry after all that you went through, and while I still don’t fully buy your story about people forgetting you, I can’t risk it being true. Not after leaving you locked away and forgotten for the last two weeks.” He paused and thought for a few minutes. “Okay,” he decided. “Let’s go eat, then you go.”

The doctor was as good as his word. We went to the cafeteria, and I ate the bland food they served up with relish. Nothing had ever tasted better in my life, and I finally truly understood the old saying that hunger is the best spice. Then, when I had my fill, he escorted me to the front door, shook my hand, and wished me well before turning back inside to go back to his normal life as if I had never been a part of it.

I took a few moments to inhale deeply, savoring the air of freedom. My confinement was over. I knew that I had no reason to be concerned that the police or the hospital would come looking for me, and for the first time, knowing that I would be forgotten actually gave me a measure of comfort.

Then, as quickly as it came, the peace and happiness fled my mind, blown away like ashes in the wind.

“Mom! Dad!” I remembered out loud. “Do you still remember me?”

And here, dear reader, is where I must leave you for now. Public Wi-Fi may be an infinite resource, but laptop batteries still need to be charged, even stolen ones. Be patient. I’ll see you soon.
