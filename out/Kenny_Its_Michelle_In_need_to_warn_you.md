We used to work together. For me, it’s been several years. For you, mere weeks. Please understand, that this is not her typing this, do not show her this, do not try and reconnect through Snap. And don’t tell Pam. Please don’t. I can only send you this because in my future we are more technology advanced, but it’s still primitive. 

I am from the future. After I quit, I got a job at a science facility that deal with animals. I can’t explain it because most is confidential… actually, fuck it — we are in a situation where confidentiality is thrown off the table. This is important because I think it’s coming for you next. 

Anyways, an animal escaped. Its name is 24601. It was a dog. A pit bull. We had injected it with a formula, I don’t know which one though, my job was to simple; keep the poor thing still. But then it was injected with another, and then another. And then a last one. It looked at me for help. He was in so much pain. And I wanted to help. But I need the money. Ever since Pam got hurt. I have to help her. I love Pam, she’s my roommate and has been for almost six years. She’s my best friend. But this dog was begging for my help, yearning for it. And so I made my mistake. 

My mind was clouded. In the night, I snuck in and watched the poor thing cripple around the terrible cell. It wasn’t a normal kennel. It couldn’t be. But when it saw me, I think it spoke to me. In my head. It told me to release it, like the harpy from The Last Unicorn. It spoke about how similar we were. How lonely we were. How powerful we could be if I released him. I think they injected him with a serum that gave him telepathy. But again, my mind was clouded. Since I saw him. It. On the injection table. The last needle went through. I was clouded in my mind. 

And so I released him from the damned cage. 

It was like the cage held an even worse beast than I could predict. 

After he ran out, he quickly distorted. Like the cage was the only thing that could hold him at bay. They knew. They fucking knew what was going to happen. There wasn’t a warning until he was released. I guess there was a reason he was in a hall alone. 

A code red was immediately announced. And as the guards ram in with their gear. There was no way to tame the beast and all I could do is stand there and watch. 24601 did not touch me. I don’t know why. But he didn’t.

I don’t want to describe what happened next. There was a lot of blood. Even for me. 

But it followed me home. I let it. It took Pam. He snatched her up. It took Pam. I knew when he took her, he could smell her on me. But… I saw his mind. I don’t know why. 

He’s coming for you. You have a few years to run for your life. 

Hide. Please hide. Run as fast as you can. 

Maybe I’m wrong though. And it has been years for you. Maybe it’s too late. Maybe you’re never going to see this because you’re already dead. 

I don’t know why it’s coming to you. Maybe he’s going to you because you did me wrong. But I did you wrong too. It doesn’t make sense. I’m scared it’s going to hurt the others I worked with that fucked me over. I don’t want that. 

Run. Please.
