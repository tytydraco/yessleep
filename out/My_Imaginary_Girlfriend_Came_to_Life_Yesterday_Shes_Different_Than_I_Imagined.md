This will make zero sense unless I explain a few things first: 

When I was about 12 I realized I was a lesbian. It was insanely hard for my to cope with the reality that I would never be viewed as ‘normal’ while trying to be what my parents wanted for me- a straight Christian girl. Believe me, I tried to fulfill their wishes, but I realized the hard way that I would never be the daughter they wanted. 

Cut to freshman year in high school, when I started fantasizing a perfect relationship. One where I could just be myself and stop having to pretend that I was something I wasn’t with somebody I loved. Being genuinely loved felt so distant to me. I felt so consumed by all the pressure to be who my parents wanted me to be that I began daydreaming of a girl that would take me away from all of it. The one to save me. My savior. I did everything I could to make her real. She was mine.  

Her name was Lilah, she was about 5’10 with a slim build and dark grey eyes that brought out her summertime freckles, and skin kissed by the sun. She was everything I could’ve ever wanted. She was the one thing in my life that stayed  constant, while everything around me fell I bits, I had the husk of a dream that was slowly dying inside me. She was my escape from the world. She meant everything to me for a long long time. 

This all changed when I finally stopped caring about what my parents said,  got the courage to begin coming out to friends and colleagues when I got into college. I even was able to get myself a girlfriend. A real girlfriend, Katherine. We’ve been living happily together for about 6 months. 

Cut to yesterday when my girlfriend had left for work, and I was sleeping in that morning since I was off.

It was about 8:15 am when I woke up to an incessant knocking on my door, I flung the door open to see who the hell was ferociously knocking, and I felt my heart stop. It was her. It have been. I know what I saw.

“ WHAT THE FUCK LILA-“ I cursed before I felt Lilah’s hand over my mouth shutting me up before I could get anything else out. 

“ Get inside the house. I need to tell you something”, she whispered, gripping my hand with a strength that compelled me to follow her. 

Lilah sat down on the couch, I stared at her completely befuddled as to how this happened. Was I dreaming? Was I drunk? What was happening to me? How is this possible? 

“ I can’t stay long, but I must disenchant you of  your fantasy. None of this is right. You know what you’ve done. Lilah mumbled a mixture of fury and sadness danced across her face. 

I locked eyes with the figure, her eyes… they weren’t the same. I knew they weren’t. I would’ve known. My Lilah’s eyes were as dark as the night I dug her up in. I knew this… thing couldn’t be her, my Lilah had scars from where I stitched her up and put her together after dragging her out of her grave. 

The thing stood up and twisted its face into an uncanny smile. It reverted back to the state that it was when I lived with it, starting with its  grey orbs. “ Did you miss me, baby?”, it cackled.

I made a mad dash to the bathroom and I’ve been there since then. I don’t know how it managed to get out of that grave once I put it back, but I know that thing is getting closer to getting into the bathroom… and putting this down is the only way I can begin to comprehend the situation. I’ll update you guys if anything else happens. I can hear its screams getting closer.
