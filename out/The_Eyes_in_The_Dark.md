It all started when I was 14. My parents rented a cottage, deep in the woods by a forgotten lake. The place felt ancient—musty, creaky, like the air had been trapped in it for decades. The living room had this massive floor-to-ceiling window that looked out into nothing but thick, suffocating woods. The kind where every crack of a branch sounded like something was stalking you. I remember hoping I could sleep, that maybe, for once, I could get some rest. But sleep had other plans.

That’s when it started. The paralysis. The kind where you wake up, but you can’t move, can’t scream, can’t do anything except lie there in a frozen panic. The room felt wrong—heavy, pressing down on me like the air itself was alive, suffocating me. It was freezing, but my skin felt too hot, my heart racing like it might explode, but no sound escaped. The silence was overwhelming, thick enough to drown in.

Then I saw it. At first, it was just a shadow—a blur in the corner of my eye. But then it… moved. It shifted, impossibly tall, stretching and folding into itself like it didn’t belong in this world. The darkness around it bent and warped, like it was pulling the light away. And those eyes… those eyes. They weren’t like any eyes I’ve ever seen. They were just two dots of light, suffocating, pressing in on me. Not glowing, not shining—just cold, hard, bright dots, burning through the darkness, drilling into me.

I couldn’t look away. No matter where I turned, they were there. They weren’t just watching me—they were inside me, pulling at my thoughts, my fears. My heart pounded in my ears, but it felt like the sound was swallowed by the suffocating quiet. I tried to scream, tried to move, but my body wouldn’t listen. It wouldn’t let me do anything but lie there, trapped. The longer I stayed frozen, the closer it came. The air felt thinner, harder to breathe. Every time I looked through half-closed eyelids, it was closer—its presence pressing in, filling the room until it was all I could feel. Its face—or what might have been a face—was inches from mine, its gaze relentless, burning, pulling at my soul.

How long I lay there, I don’t know. But eventually, the paralysis lifted, and I bolted to my mom’s room. I didn’t leave her side until daylight chased it away. But that was only the beginning.

It came back every year, always at the end of summer. Every time the air turned heavy, thick with the chill of autumn creeping in, it would return. Same presence. Same suffocating weight pressing on my chest. Sometimes it was just a shape in the corner. Sometimes it was solid, looming above me, blacker than the shadows, its eyes—those suffocating, burning dots—never leaving me.

And no matter where I went, no matter how far I ran, it found me. Every house, every city—it didn’t matter. The rooms would change, but it never did. It was always there, always watching, always waiting.

I was always alone. Bullied, an outcast, I found comfort in the quiet, in the empty spaces. But there was one thing I could count on: my dog. A black Doberman, loyal and strong. She was the only one who ever made me feel safe. That night, it came again.

The air turned cold, and my dog froze. Her ears twitched, her eyes narrowing, and then came the growl—a low, primal sound that wasn’t like anything I’d ever heard before. It wasn’t just a warning. It was fear. She knew something was coming, something I couldn’t see. I froze too. And then it appeared—blacker than black, impossibly dark, with those eyes—those suffocating dots of light—burning through the dark.

She growled again, desperate, but I couldn’t move. I couldn’t protect her. I couldn’t protect myself. The thing hovered, its shape distorting the air, pressing down on me. I felt its weight, cold and heavy, squeezing the life out of me. My dog stayed frozen, her eyes locked on the stairs, watching, guarding. Two weeks later, she was gone. We never figured out why. But I know she wasn’t just guarding me. She was guarding us both from that thing. And I couldn’t protect her. I couldn’t save her.

I thought maybe it was just a childhood nightmare. I thought maybe it had faded with age. But at 26, I was wrong. It came back, and this time, it was worse. It wasn’t just in the corner anymore. It wasn’t just watching. This time, it was above me, on the ceiling, watching, suffocating. And for the first time, I felt it. It wasn’t just a presence—it was physical. It was pressing down on me, crushing my chest, suffocating me. Its eyes, those suffocating dots of light, still burned through the darkness, but now, I could feel the weight of them. They weren’t just watching me anymore—they were pressing into me, pushing me closer to the edge.

I know, deep down, that it will never stop. It will always be there, waiting, watching, lurking in the dark, waiting for the next time I close my eyes. And every time I do, I wonder: will I see it again?
