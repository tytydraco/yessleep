I genuinely don’t know how to start this but I have to get it down fully somewhere. I never do this ever but I don’t know where or what I am anymore. I just had this dream, this dream, I can’t even call it a dream, it was a whole entirely different life, a fantasy, it was my life. It lasted 11 years. It’s fading away from me, like fog on a glass pane. I verbally cannot describe how real and long this felt. I just woke up 10 minutes ago. And I still don’t have a grasp on reality like I only know this because you guys were in it. Imagine you waiting for the next season, the next holiday, next year, it feels as real as it did in the dream, and yet it was only 50 minutes or something.

 I was like a small teenage boy, I was my current age but more short, I could remember and see things as accurate as they were, I could comprehend anything and be able to figure out things. I had some sort of telepathy and to be able to manipulate reality. There were more people like this in this world, imagine a cyberpunk world but a little more closer to today’s reality, but more feeling like manifold garden map in Gmod. I was a boy with a few friends I know irl. And a few online, they were the people I knew, it started from there,

 I don’t remember a backstory but it was that. We were all capable of understanding the universe and the stuff we did. We all went to the same school, imagine a Japanese classroom but by the seaside, the large windows viewing just beach and water. I couldn’t imagine what I learned but I know I would often doze off into the window, I would pass every test anyway. Eventually, since we were so smart we were in higher classes with older people. We had a group of friends. And we progressed a friendship throughout the first 4  years that lasted all throughout this life. 

I could refer to them ang time, it was comfort, they were there for me. When I woke up I re learned that these same people included some online people. This group of friends consisted of 10 people. They were the best and I could rely on them and relate and always talk to and they were always there like I’d wake up and they’d just be there for me and I would for them. It was nice. Think of these people as high fashioned fits, like future Y2K, that’s the whole aesthetic of this kind of life, future frutiger aero but in reality. The big turn point was by the time we’d mastered a lot we’d start just doing whatever with technology. We’d been drafted into some organization. Now to best describe the feeling of this think of like the TVA from Loki or Aperture science. The absence of trust in the team of workers or organization was mild but it was nonetheless impactful to our lives. 

We’d Been selected to represent and keep the line of reality, the fabric of the universe, how it worked it’s supposed to, the way it should. We’d need to make sure that the endless possibilities of universes would stay endless and the future would come to us in the future, the past would be the past, math would be math. We were the chosen ones. We went into training, and eventually we’d progress as a group. Now this is 6 years into the dream. My irl friend in this dream would soon marry another and I’d be his best man, and this was an important moment because this marriage, our intelligence was too much to bare over the universe, it caused a rip, a tear, a descent of chaos. 

My memory fades here, but from that point I remember a moment we are using mechanisms and plans, machines that manipulate and alter time and space. Think of a black plague, major threats of the WHOLE UNIVERSE. We’d use light, manipulate reality and construct machines. But we figured it together. This blackness of the reality shunned itself. Now think of the feeling of liminal spaces and derealization. This thing was caused intentionally by a corrupt army of officials choosing to end the world as we know, the physics, to alter it in a way they’d thought would be better. Year 7 - 8 at this point. We fight and we’d lose a couple of friends. It would start to be detrimental, reality was closing in, I could feel the horror, even witnessing the absolute mass of space, how big it was. We would counter the void growing by pushing reality back into it, the machines we made used current materials, and we’d condense these materials so much the gravity would warp the vacuum, it would bend time and we choose a point, push our reality in and exterminate the void. Our efforts were effective but they would not last. 

I would soon be left me and my friend and his wife, his wife was taken. I worked with the facility and organization, it was falling. But before we left, before when here were more than 5 of us, we set a plan. A full reset, with a backup of our reality, held with a system to completely restore a new big bang. It was so risky. What if we never saw each other again? It was now year 9 and our efforts were becoming more lessened. We’d lost more. Reality was closing in, the void came in, fog was coming. Memories wiped, physics changes. Repairs were useless. Cloning was full time to provide Materials. Energy was so much, too much, what will happen? Eventually.

 Year 10 - 11. My friends are gone, the organization is gone. In one week. I was the only person in the universe to stop this. I had to do the backup. That feeling will always stick with me. Could you imagine, knowing you, are the only person in the entire universe? No one else is there. You’re alone. Completely alone. There is nothing. The void surrounds everything.

 This week, I inputted the backup, and shocked the whole universe. The Big Bang, the memories flashed, I saw years 1 - 6. I felt feelings, tastes I thought I’d never taste again, so familiar. The last light burned. I woke up, still in this life, but again. It worked, the reality progress exactly the same. I saw them. It shocked the void away that reality changed to be without it. These people, I was barren, I was so afraid. I hugged everyone. This was the final day. They were here again. I closed my eyes as I hugged them in a facility room we’d gather to eat lunch every day. Everyone was here again. I cried, I closed my eyes thinking this moment could last forever.

Then I woke up. Hugging a pillow.
