I was never quite “stand out” in most areas of life, I mean it was painfully typical; not athletic, average intelligence (probably), never had a ton of friends in school growing up, and I wasn’t pretty either. 
Being considered “ugly” was the worst thing on the list for sure, I feel like pretty girls can get away with lacking in all other areas of life, you know, being average or below average in most human traits. Not me though. Not even the strongest most eccentric personality could save me, at least I’m convinced of that. Not that I have one to test my hypothesis to begin with. 

I just really despise the fact that I’m not pretty. 

And that’s why I hated my drawing class senior year of high school. I guess my one redeeming quality is that I’m a really great artist. Not painting or sculpture or any of that, just straight up drawing from imagination, understanding how to communicate 3D objects and whatnot. I’m really excellent at drawing people in particular. Hence why I was automatically moved into my school’s advanced studio class rather than starting with the beginner art classes. Lucky me. 

I really do love drawing though, but we did a lot of self portrait work in that class. Working with figure and whatnot. We drew fake figures and different box arrangements in class because we couldn’t actually have models in the high school classes, unlike college- but for homework it was always self portraits. I hated going home and sitting in front of my mirror, drawing my own face meticulously. I became hyper-aware of every flaw, every uneven characteristic, every crease. And I drew it perfectly. I couldn’t help myself. If one thing was for sure, I was going to flaunt the one skill I had and show up to class with the most dead on perfect rendition of myself possible. Sometimes the praise I would receive made me forget about the face drawn on my giant sketch board beside me, but I would at least always be reminded of my charcoaled resemblance staring back at me when I folded the pages back over after class. 

It was maybe the 4th time I had to draw myself, sitting in front of the mirror, nearly numb to the fact that I had to address what stared back at me when I decided to break some rules. I had finished my sketch, my face this time nearly dead on centered on the page, not looking to the side or at an angle, and I decided to tweak it. Ever so slightly though. I moved my eyes a few millimeters apart, opened them up just a bit. I made my top lip not so lopsided, but nothing that I thought others would notice. I also shaped my chin a bit sharper, but again, barely. I looked at my work, and it still felt like me, just a little bit better. They wouldn’t even know. I looked at myself in the mirror, then the drawing, and went to bed a bit more satisfied than normally. 

But when I woke up that next morning before school, something changed. My drawing was still sitting out, staring at me. I did my morning routine in the bathroom, but my face didn’t look quite the same. I couldn’t tell if I was tripping or not, but I finished what I was doing and walked over to my mirror. I really studied myself, and the realization that there were no longer discrepancies between my face in the mirror and my edited face on my drawing pad nearly made me pinch myself, like I was in a dream. But I wasn’t, and I looked ever slightly different. Prettier. 

I went to school, repeated my typical day but with some newfound courage. I actually sat with some people at lunch for once, people I knew of course, but I purposefully ate lunch alone so often they had forgotten I had the same lunch period as them. I knew them from my old English class, and I wasn’t a developed part of their friend group, but they didn’t seem to ever mind me joining conversation from time to time. I think what scared me about them is the fact they were just better looking, higher in the “social class” or whatever too. I figured they wouldn’t be interested in me. It was a mix of guys and girls, but I only really knew Ramona, Keith, Alexis, Harper and David well though. I engaged in a bit of conversation but my mind just drifted, eager to go home and test my theory again. See if I was just convincing myself of delusions. 

I didn’t have a portrait as homework that night, but I drew one nonetheless. I made it look like me, and compared it to the one from last night. They looked identical despite a slight head angle, but I added some adjustments to the new portrait. Prettier. 

I wanted to stay up all night, but I decided to repeat the same cycle as the night before, so I glanced in the mirror and back, and went to sleep. I woke up and again to my amazement I looked identical to my drawing. Prettier, but not pretty. 
No one had to tell me twice- I had some ability to alter my physical traits. 
I’m going to speed through this next part, but to say the least I took advantage of the opportunity. 

Through 2 months worth of trial and error, I found this out. 
I have tried to drastically change characteristics in one drawing overnight. Never again. It reverted my face back to where I started. Ugly. That was annoying, and it happened 3 times. Now I believe I know the limit of how much to change. I’m simply not too greedy with my actions, patience pays off. 
The change would only occur after I went to sleep. I tried napping to speed up my process but it really took a few solid hours of good sleep to create the result, so that’s what I continued doing.
I switched from drawing in charcoal, and learned how to draw on my iPad. I could be a bit more precise this way, but using color never mattered. I couldn’t change my hair, or my skin tone, or my eye color, just the layout of my face.
I could change my body though. I found this out about 1 1/2 months in. I didn’t have to work for anything, I simply changed my body inch my inch. I didn’t do it as often because it simply took forever. The face was much more achievable. 

Finally, at halfway through the school year, I achieved my goal. I had missed a lot of school to be honest, obsessing over these details and understanding every quirk of the system was more important to me. Plus, when I failed those 3 times, I avoided school like the plague until I made myself presentable again. People noticed though. After that winter break, I was pretty. More than pretty, I was stunning. Nearly unrecognizable. Looking back, changing so drastically in the presence of people who knew me before was a risky move, but the school was so big not many people commented on it. I just suddenly became recognizable once I reached a threshold. It was wonderful.

I dropped out of the art class about a month and a half into the year. I figured if anyone was going to recognize the changes in my art and behavior, it would be them, so I left. I didn’t need a studio class anyways, there is nothing more for me to learn. I had everything I needed. On the other hand, my small cohort of friends noticed the gradual shift.

They never actually mentioned anything to my face. We would have conversations at lunch, but I could see the malicious nature of their eyes. Especially the girls. Especially Ramona. She was so sweet, so gentle, always asking how my day was and asking about my life. She acted as though my physical changes didn’t affect her at all. I could see it in Alexis and Harper, they didn’t quite treat me the same way. But Ramona would snap me, comment nice things on my new instagram account- she was trying to find an in. To sabotage me. I just knew it. Her joyful and affirming personality just rubbed me the wrong way. And the way David looked at her. I never understood why he never looked at me like that. She was beautiful, and always has been, so I can see why he would have initial interest but I far surpassed her weeks ago. At this point in time I had guys in all my classes talking to me, and girls giving me the cold shoulder, but I tunnel visioned on David and Ramona. Why wouldn’t he look at me like that? Even Keith had sparked interest but David? No. Was I… ugly? No, no, I know I wasn’t. But was Ramona prettier? No? But I had to make sure.

I went home, and pulled up her instagram. I found her most recent selfie, and began to draw. It was perfect, every line accounted for. It was an authentic picture too, no filter. But there weren’t enough creases. There weren’t enough flaws. So I slowly incorporated them in. I mean, no one deserves to be perfect, everyone is going to have some flaws, and she won’t even notice. I just pulled the eyes down slightly, made her nose a bit sharper, just little things. Just to make sure I was still prettier. To test my theory. 

I had never tried editing another person before. I gifted her my portrait the next day at lunch, and she loved it. It was still an excellent drawing nonetheless. I had her hold it up to her face for a picture, and her face had changed. I celebrated inwardly and remained content in my achievement. But he still looked at her in the same way. My vision tunneled harder. He just wasn’t getting it. Boys are dumb. 

So I did it again. Made her uglier. It was noticeable to me, but not to him. He always would sit next to her. Laugh in her direction. He didn’t make eye contact with me in the same way as Keith. He liked her. I walked the hallways after my last class, feeling eyes on me. Some were good. Some were bad. I didn’t care, I tunneled them out. Until I was stopped by a group of girls I recognized from my psychology class. I didn’t know their names. 

They asked about my surgery in a demeaning tone. They pulled me aside, told me “they knew I had gotten work done” and that “I couldn’t hide the truth forever”. “It was obvious, other people could tell too”. “My newfound attention was undeserved”. You can just tell when gossip has been stewing for some time. I figured a long time ago someone aught to talk about me after what changes I’ve gone through. It hadn’t seemed to affect my image until now though. Skanks probably found their boy crushes commenting on my posts.  

Over the next week I made Ramona uglier each day. But each day their interactions didn’t change. And she still treated me in the same way. Stupid little princess wannabe. Princesses can’t be ugly. David is a prince and she didn’t deserve him. So I also started drawing David too, I made him more handsome, yet he still didn’t understand what had to be done. He had noticed Ramona’s decline, but they thought it was some health problem. It’s like he almost cared for her more. I heard he even went to the ER with her once. It was unfathomable to me. To make matters worse, I noticed I got treated more and more alien-like as the week progressed. Effing rumor weeds. Weeds are ugly. 

I scavenged social media for the group of girls from my psychology class. I used that whole weekend in order to draw them too, along with Ramona and David. Once a day. 

Over that next month, they all started to decline. Not pretty. David had reached his threshold, he was just perfect. A prince. Girls fawned over him, but he and Ramona still talked. They even went on dates. She was so ugly. Sometimes she would even cry at lunch, cry into Davids arms while Alexis and Harper showered her in praise. When would she drop the act? I just stared one day, I couldn’t bring my focus away. Looking upon all of the work I had done. It was eerie. Everything I despised in a face all wrapped into one person. The weeds begin looking similar too. Each unique yet comprised of my hate.

I stopped sitting with them after that. I went where I was loved and admired, but always catching myself staring in the direction of that lunch table. They were all so close. So confused. Yet still happy. 

The boys I sat with were thrilled at my presence, but like I said in the beginning, I never had the most eccentric personality. Somehow, I got more boring as the days went on. Sometimes I just wanted to sit alone. The next month I had dated around quite a few guys and simply was not exciting anymore to them. I think I caused some fights too, friends don’t seem to like it when their friends have kissed the same girl they were just about to date. So I moved to a group of junior guys and befriended them. The cycle repeats. It gets old.

I see David and Ramona dating now. He just cannot see what I see. I tried so hard to make him see, and it just didn’t work, so I started drawing her body too. Slowly contorting it over time. The year is nearly over though. I almost forgot about that group of weeds, there isn’t much of an update with them. 2 of them stopped coming to school all together, and the rest avoid me like the plague. I feel like they know I have something to do with their situation, it’s all too coincidental but I don’t really care. The only problem I have at hand is Ramona. 

Then genius struck me. What if I slowly contorted her neck, just twisted it each day until it… breaks? I could slowly make her body unlivable. If David couldn’t see the truth, I would simply be able to take the option away from him. I contemplated this for a few days. Tunnel vision again, I just can’t keep my eyes away from the appalling act being committed before me. She is everything I deemed ugly in one, yet she still has that smile on her face. She knows she’s getting to me, and that’s why she guilt trips David into staying, because she knows I could have him if she just let him go. That’s why she keeps up this charade, just to taunt me with something I cannot effect. So I think I’m going to set David free. 

Update: 

I drew out that first step of my plan. Her neck is ever so slightly twisted, but to this day I am taunted with that image on my iPad. Looking back on it, I don’t know what possibly went through my mind to take that drastic step, heck, I don’t even know if it ever worked. On my way to school that following morning, I hit a deer. Stupid thing died, but unfortunately I didn’t. My car veered into a tree off the road at about 35mph, leaving my hands unrecognizably scrambled from glass and a lot of scaring on my arms. But my face. I was left with a scar on my lip. Deformed it a bit. Not a lot. But it was just ugly. The thought just haunted me, “I can be prettier than this, I know I can.” After leaving the hospital about a week later, my hands were in casts. A month later and I still couldn’t feel them. You would think I would have given myself time to heal, given the doctors told me I would probably never regain full motor control of my hands. But I didn’t believe that, hence why I decided to pick up my pencil after days of staring at myself in the mirror. Ugly. I took the most recent drawing of myself off my iPad and started editing it, I figured I could do that much. But I screwed it up, I really did, and I just couldn’t fix myself. I couldn’t draw exact enough. I remember the panic after realizing the gravity of what I had just done. The anger I felt, the helplessness. I screamed for hours into the night, I nearly broke my iPad trying to fix my face over and over again. I must have passed out from the exhaustion. 

I woke up the next day to someone ugly looking back at me in the mirror. I couldn’t even recognize myself, I remember I wept for hours. I tried drawing again and again and again and nothing prevailed. 

It’s been about 2 years since that took place. My hands never recovered, they still shake and some of my fingers are stuck in curled positions. Maybe one day physical therapy or surgery will progress to a point of saving them. The amount of hours I’ve spent staring in that stupid mirror. I shattered it after a few months. I was a recluse for nearly a year after the accident happened, until my mom forced me to apply for college. I forgot that I never even mentioned my mom before. You would think a parent would notice you face changing, but not mom. She was blind.

Now im in a community college, don’t know what I’m doing though. Maybe business. Like I said before, I have no defining traits or skills. Not anymore. I’m open to suggestions. 

I figured since you guys read my previous story, you are wondering what happened to Ramona and David. I don’t completely remember what I wrote, I found it in my notes app the other day, but I really don’t want to read it again. I feel like sharing my story anonymously will give me a sense of peace, maybe someone will take a life lesson from it or something. I’m still angry, but it’s hard to tell if it’s directed at my peers or myself. Maybe both. I was thinking about Ramona the other day though, and I found out her and David are engaged, I saw it on instagram. I could fix her though. Draw her and fail as I did with myself. She could become beautiful again. She still posts pictures though. Happy, unashamed. She even praises God now. That almost baffles me more than why David stayed with her. Still feels like she is taunting me through the screen, preying on my reaction to her success. But maybe she was genuine that whole time, maybe she really did like me. I guess no matter what I do, she will be happy with her prince. 

I can’t help but stare at her face though. It’s always been so eerie to me, but now I know why. 
It looks like me.
