After my last [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/0jn6ZXAn0s), I received a chat message on Reddit by someone claiming that they knew me. At first, I thought they were trolling, until this person used my real name. 

Initially, I panicked. Wouldn't anyone? I thought that I'd been vague enough about our location and our identities that it would be near impossible to narrow it down to us. However, it has occurred to me that someone that knows Ramy in real life could easily identify that my posts were about him just based on how much he tends to stand out. 

That meant that these messages were from someone who has seen us both in person. 

(If you haven't seen my previous updates, click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/NWJnO2Gtx1) to see my life fall apart in real time.)

Apprehensively, I messaged back, 'Why are you telling me this? What do you want?'

The response was, 'Im scared for you. youre forgetting who and what Ramy is'

As I was typing my response, I received another message: 'he will turn on you if he finds this series'

I asked this Redditor who they were. The only response was that they were someone who was experienced with jinn. They offered to prove it to me. 

'Please don't.'

'not with Ramy. with the animal tech. dont think im ready for him yet lol'

'Seriously, don't. Please just stay out of it. Trust me, you don't want to be involved in ANY of this.' 

'i can help.'

'I have enough problems in my life, I don't need this.'

I didn't receive an answer. *Shit.* Afterwards, I clicked on their account, finding that they had absolutely nothing on it. Must be a burner. 

Despite what happened between us, I still am terrified of Ramy finding this series. Somehow, I've endeared him to me, but I'm sure that could change quickly if he discovered that I'd revealed so much about him, regardless of the efforts to conceal his identity. Clearly, I hadn't done enough. 

To summarize my emotional state, I was *not* party rocking in the house tonight. (I know the tenses are a mess in that sentence, but let me have my stupid joke.)

On a more positive note, my hand has been getting better. I've been mostly keeping it covered, since the skin is highly sensitive. It's currently in the 'gross' phase of the healing process: splotches of bright red with patches of dead, yellowing skin peeling off. Sexy, right? 

While I was at work, I found myself scrutinizing the other employees that passed through the halls, becoming more and more paranoid each time someone would as much as glance in my general direction. Was it one of them who messaged me? Was that person out there right now? 

Hold on... could it have been Aanya? Sure, she'd sworn not to lay a hand on me, but she never mentioned anything about cyberspace. That all being said, she might be too afraid of Ramy to even attempt something so risky. She had looked like she wanted to crawl out of her own skin when she was in the server room with him. 

I definitely couldn't rule her out, but... something just wasn't adding up. I needed more information. All that I knew about  my #1 Reddit Fan was that they were gunning for the hoofed jinn. My thought process was that if I could find the jinn, then I could potentially find this Redditor as well. Maybe keep them from interfering in my affairs. 

I got ahead of my duties so that I'd have enough time to visit the animal facility before break, then headed straight to post mortem, all the while reminding myself that I had protection. Nothing could touch me. When I arrived, I couldn't decide if I was relieved or disappointed when I saw that the fridge door was properly closed, devoid of the crunching of bones or the clopping of hooves. To be safe, I did a quick lap around the facility to see if I could find my hoofed bestie, but there were no signs of it. 

I thought back to when I had first encountered the hoofed jinn. What time of night had that been? It was roughly an hour before my shift was over. As disturbing as it was to think about, maybe the hoofed jinn simply wasn't hungry yet. I resolved to check back later and returned to the lab. 

At midnight, Ramy was in the break room before me, comfortably slumped down in one of the chairs, sipping from his thermos. 

I could feel his judgmental stare through his sunglasses as he watched me prepare Chef Boyardi like a grown-up, "Have you ever eaten a vegetable before?" 

I retorted, "That's rich coming from the guy who's on the frat boy 'coffee and alcohol' diet. Don't you think you might have a drinking problem?"

"Nope. Clearly, I'm very good at it."

As I went to pass him, he caught one of my belt loops with a finger, pulling me towards him. I gave him what he wanted, leaning in to kiss him. I felt my phone buzz in my pocket. We weren't done and I absolutely was not about to cut it short. Once the microwave beeped, Ramy released me, telling me to go eat my trash. 

I may be a trash-eating rat man, but he didn't hesitate to jump *this* rat man's bones, so what does that make him? A raccoon? 
 
My phone vibrated again. I pulled it out to see a Reddit notification. Silently, I prayed that it wasn't what I thought it was. 

As per usual, my prayers went unanswered: 'the ghul shouldnt be a problem after tonight' 

*Oh no.* I quickly made up an excuse about an emergency in the animal facility,  then promised to be right back. 
 
I flew down the stairs, hoping that the Redditor hadn't committed to whatever thrilling heroics they were planning. I didn't know what I was going to do once I got there, I just wanted to make sure that some chronically online dumbass wasn't going to get themselves killed. 

When I reached post mortem, I found that the fridge door was open again, revealing the hoofed jinn as it slurped up a mouse's tail like one would a spaghetti noodle. My stomach fluttered, threatening to eject the Chef Boyardi. 

Despite them both being jinn, the differences between the hoofed creature and Ramy seemed to be as distinct as the dissimilarities between Chihuahuas and Rottweilers. I'd seen Ramy get blown away by shotgun shells only to appear unscathed mere hours later. Meanwhile, my encounter with the hoofed jinn had been a week ago, yet its chemical burns had only turned leathery as opposed to disappearing completely. It was healing faster than me, but not by much. 

The hoofed jinn scowled at me, its rough, reddened skin making the creature resemble angry beef jerky. Its childlike voice would've been unnerving on its own, but became far more disconcerting when the words were punctuated with blood in its teeth, "*You again?*"

Now that I'd found it, truthfully, I wasn't entirely sure what to do. As stupid as it sounds, I hadn't thought that far ahead. 

I started stammering and I honestly can't remember whatever dumb thing I was trying to say. Without warning, it lunged for me. My hands reacted before my mind could, shielding my face as as the hoofed jinn's fingers grasped for me. The hoofed jinn swore over the sound of its skin being singed, retreating away from me. Shaking, I slowly lowered my arms, watching as the creature glowered at me from the other side of the room, its face shifting from being humanoid to cat-like, the transitions between each visage reminding me of wet cement taking form.   

"How did *you, of all people* get an ifrit's favor?" The hoofed jinn snarled, its voice deepening with each word that it spoke. 

It took a second, but I found my voice. "I need to- I need to ask you something."

Its eyes narrowed in disbelief, "*What?!"*

"Have you... uh, noticed anyone following you?"

"Yes! *You!*" It snapped. 

Before I could say anything else, it raised one bony finger, tilting its head as if it were listening for something. 

"Quiet." It growled, getting on all fours, its fingers clawing into the tile. 

When something you're afraid of is scared, that's a bad sign. I backed up until I was partially hidden in the refrigerator, the metallic odor of gore invading my nostrils. If you weren't aware, exposed brains have their own smell, like warm mucous. Now, you know. Enjoy. Suffer as I have. 

The hoofed jinn crawled towards the post mortem room's door, it's spindly limbs a whirl in the creature's haste. I felt myself crouching lower, anticipation making my breath quicken, dreading what could be on the other side. 

The door creaked open. A round object  slid across the ground, causing the hoofed jinn to leap away with an aggravated hiss. A talisman? The person who'd thrown it was donned in full lab PPE that is normally only required when handling infectious biological material: thick protective goggles, a N-95 respirator, a hair covering, latex gloves, and a lab coat. 

The hoofed jinn cursed at its assailant, but it sounded like nothing more than bravado as the creature cowered away from the talisman. PPE person's voice was muffled by their respirator, but it sounded like a man's voice. I couldn't understand what he was saying, but it sounded like he was speaking in Arabic. The hoofed jinn seized the nearest object, which was a dirty, empty rodent cage, and tossed it. The PPE person ducked, but now was showered with rat droppings and soiled bedding. The whole time, he didn't stop his mutterings. 

The hoofed jinn cringed away as the PPE person retreived the talisman and advanced on it, holding the medallion in the creature's feline face. The jinn's high-pitched shriek could've made glass shatter, making my ears ring. Its body began to convulse as it dissolved into black, turbulent smoke, swirling towards the talisman, its skin peeling away to expose the muscle beneath. Ribbons of smoke disappeared until the hoofed jinn was reduced to a grimacing, simmering pile of bones. Not long after, even those crumbled into ashes.  

The PPE person turned. I ducked further into the refrigerator. 

I heard a muffled, "Lab Rat?"

I shut my eyes and sighed, more foul air entering my lungs. *God damn it.* Reluctantly, I rose out of my hiding spot. 

The PPE person shouted through his mask, "You may not understand what I'm doing now, but I promise that it's for the good of everyone, including you. So please, let me leave first."

Mouth dry, I swallowed before replying, "Why should I?"

"You know what he'll do to me if he finds me before I'm ready." 

"Ready for *what?*"

"I can't tell you that. Not right now. Please, from one human to another. All you have to do is let me get a head start. You can tell him you saw me, if you want, if you believe that it'll make you safer. Just let me have time to get some distance."

Thanks to the talisman, I was shocked when I heard Ramy's voice in the doorway. "Why don't you just ask me?"

Oh God. How much did he hear? His playful grin gave nothing away as he shut the door behind him, standing between us and the only exit. 

The PPE person stiffened, clutching his talisman harder. His voice was surprisingly even as he addressed Ramy, "I only came here for the ghul. Please, allow me to leave."

Ramy ignored him, glancing at me. "You alright, Lab Rat?"

I nodded quickly, heart hammering as I tried to figure out what he could be thinking. 

The PPE person continued, "I didn't know he was here. If he's someone special to you, just know that I made no threats against him."

He was pretending like he didn't know that Ramy and I are lovers. Why? 

Ramy asked, "Is that true?"

I nodded again, "I hid in here when he came for the hoofed jinn. He didn't try to hurt me."

Ramy's attention shifted towards the PPE person. "Glad to hear it."

The PPE person said, "Like I said, I was only here for the ghul. Now that I've taken care of it, I ask that you please let me pass."

Ramy let out a small laugh, making no move away from the door, "You know, I've heard so many stories about magicians in ancient times. There aren't many in the modern age, at least none that are worth noticing. I gotta say, this is pretty exciting."

"I'm not a sorcerer." The PPE person insisted. "I simply wanted to be rid of this creature. It kept eating my specimens."

Ramy snorted, his voice still deceptively friendly, "Oh, don't sell yourself short! Enslaving a jinn of *any* kind is a big accomplishment. You should feel proud yourself!"

PPE person replied, "I'm not proud. Now please, I have no desire to antagonize you. I ask only for the same courtesy in return. If you can't abide that, I'll have no choice but to defend myself."

Ramy shrugged, "Fine."

He moved to stand by my side, his smirk mischievous. The PPE person stepped forward cautiously, gaze fixed on Ramy. The medallion swung in his fist as he neared the door. 

"I'll see you later, alright?" Ramy spoke as if saying goodbye to an old friend. 

The PPE person didn't turn his back on us as he passed through the doorway, breaking into a run as soon as he entered the hall. 

As Ramy watched him, I gingerly reached for his shoulder. He let out a small sigh when I touched him, his fingers covering mine gently. 

He looked over at me. "It smells in here."

We headed back up to the breakroom. The smell of death still in my nose and the memory of the ghul sucking up that mouse tail had thoroughly destroyed my appetite. I ended up just playing with the cheap spaghetti I'd abandoned earlier, my mind unable to stop relating the noodles to mouse tails. 

Ramy's question made my heart skip a beat, "Did you know who that was?"

I shook my head, letting a limp noodle fall from my fork, "No. He seemed to know me, though."

Technically, not a lie. He doesn't need to know about these posts. Or the fact that it's my fault that the PPE guy knows so much about us both. 


So... PPE guy, I know you're reading this. You shouldn't have interfered in my life. You're putting us both in danger by messing with him. I don't care about your ridiculous hero complex or whatever the hell you've got going on. Please, just go into hiding and *stay out of it.*
