Hey All, hope you're doing well. 

Made myself this throwaway account in hopes that I can tell this story without losing my job. You'd be surprised how seriously a certain online shopping company takes workers talking about their experiences online (It's the one that rhymes with Bama-Gone). 

Anyway, I wanted to share this strange experiece I had today while delivering packages for people. Something totally bizarre happened to me today and I can't quite find the explanation to understand what it was. Here's hoping someone in the comments can get me some sort of answer.

Today at work I was given a new area to deliver to. (For privacy reasons I will not be saying what city/town it was, just that it was in the Midwest U.S., and was on the fairly larger end of suburb sizes) For those that don't know, "BamaGone" uses third-party companies to deliver for them, and as contracts are renewed, drivers are sent to new areas. Such was the case for me today, being sent to this town that I have passed through before but never stopped at. 

I want to say for about the first 90 or 100 deliveries everything is normal, the same mundane routine of driving to a house and dropping off a box of whatever on their front porch. I've got my earbuds going listening to a podcast, chipping away at the 180-ish delivered I gotta get done. 

It is delivery 111 that I came to write my experience today. 

Delivery 111 seemed like another run of the mill box drop-off when I previewed the route to the house, just another person buying their toilet paper online. Turning onto the street though is when things started to get weird. The house was on a 'No Outlet' marked road, a long, straight street with a culdesac at the end of it. The house itself wasn't at the end of the culdesac, but it was maybe 3 houses away from the end. Sorry, some of the specifics are a little foggy. 

One thing I remember very clearly is the dogs. Being a delivery driver, dogs are one thing that will make my head swing on a swivel. My ears perk up hearing a bark come from any direction. This being the case, I was keeping track of the dogs on the street. Each one seemed to lose their minds seeing me drive past, barking and barking as my van went by each house on the road. It soon became a symphony of howls are woofs as every dog joined in the chorus. They continued to get louder and louder, and whether it was due to the increasing number of members of the choir or because they were forcing themselves to increase volume, I'm not sure. All I know for sure is that when I arrived at the house, threw my van in park, and hopped out with a package, all the dogs had stopped.

I want to be clear with this, as I hope I can convey how unnatural it felt. The moment my feet hit the pavement outside this home, every dog stopped in unison. They didn't taper off. Their barks did not echo. It was a dead stop, like a car slamming into a solid concrete wall. It didn't register for a second or two, but when I noticed it I did a double-check of my surroundings. All the dogs I could see (maybe 7?) were still outside, by their fences, staring at me. Not with malice or fear or curiosity. The best way to describe it has to be vacancy. Like there was nothing there, a breathing fur covered statue, eyes locked onto me. The hair on my neck shot up. And as if it never happened, the dogs turned away and got back to sniffing each other's asses or whatever. I had to get back to work before I got docked for getting off-task. 

And that need to get back to delivering is where the second part of this situation occurs: the delivery. They had a medium-sized box being brought to them, most likely a pair of shoes or a book or something, so I had it tucked under my arm. I began walking from the front of my van towards the fence gate and the yard. When I touched that chain-link fence gate, something overtook me. Not physically, but emotionally. Some primal unexplainable fear? I'm still not completely sure, as it only lasted a fraction of a second. All I know is I had goosebumps run down my spine.

I had to carry on though, so I opened the fence and stepped foot into the yard. It reeked of mildew, wood rot and a faint undertone of extremely acidic bile. The smell assaulted my senses like a gorilla punched me in the face. Iron Mike would have faultered, let alone the scrawny delivery guy. 

The worst part about it was the feeling of dread it brought with it. Not like the fear I felt at the fence, but a gnawing, gut uneasiness that makes your knees awaken slightly. One that became worse and worse at every step, dread amplifying at every step I took on the cracked sidewalk leading to the front door. I still have no idea what was going on when I was in that yard. All I know is that I truly felt like I was in an area that I should not be in, not for any specific rule or reason, but a feeling similar to that my place on the food chain had changed. I was at the mercy of another being that I could not see, hear, feel, or comprehend. I was on the verge of a panic attack and falling over vomitting when I reached the door. I set the box down, took a picture, and ran out of that yard as fast as I could.

I still don't know how this will make any sense, but...

 I felt like I was being chased. 

I felt like I was inches away from being grabbed and dragged back to that house, back to whatever was making me feel so horribly uneasy, so awfully scared and sick in the first place. What was worse is that I felt the path before me began to stretch little by little. My run turned to a sprint, and a sprint into a desperate final push to try and get free of whatever the hell was going on. 

Thankfully, as some of you might have put it together already, I made it out of that yard. I burst through the gate, left that thing open and hoped in my van. Ain't no way in hell I was wasting time making sure the gate was closed. I just got in my van, turned around and peeled out of that street. I decided to pop a break to give myself enough time to calm down before I get back to my job. I ended up getting a call from my boss a few minutes before my break was over, yelling at me that I hadn't delivered a package in close to 35 minutes. I told him I just did one and then began my break. Apparently the tracking system messed up somehow and said I went 20 minutes without delivering a package before taking my break. 

After that though, I got back to work, finished my route and went home. Same stuff as usual. Just a lot more weird thoughts on my mind on my drive home. There was one specific thing that has been stuck in my brain and ultimately what prompted me to type this post instead of going to bed. 

The dogs. 

They didn't bark at all on my way out. They didn't run the fence line trying to race my van. They didn't even seem to care that I was there...

Every dog on that street was staring at the gate that I left open.



Sorry this dragged out so long, I kept thinking of more things I needed to give context for as I wrote! 

If I end up delivering to this street/house again, maybe I'll have an update for you all? If I do, it will be linked at the top of this post. See y'all around!
