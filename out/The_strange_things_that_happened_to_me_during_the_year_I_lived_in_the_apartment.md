I thought I found a great place to lease. It was newly furnished, close to work, had around-the-clock management and a designated parking space.  

&#x200B;

The price was a bit above average, but nothing I couldn't handle. I signed the lease for 1 year and paid a 1.5 month deposit.  I was estatic to hear the OK to move in. The entire building had eight floors above ground, including a rooftop with clothes lines and a psudo laundromat for inhabitants, as well as one underground floor that was the parking lot. My apartment was on the 7th floor and I shared the floor with another residence (two apartments to each floor).

&#x200B;

When you open the door, the first thing you see is the small kitchen and you could put your groceries on the counter, very convenient. The the living room doubled as the dining room and there were two bedrooms and a single bathroom(with a small window for ventilation).  The two apartments have the same floorplans, just in mirror images, so all the pipes were in the same area and the bedrooms were away from each other.  Just great planning in general.

&#x200B;

 I turned my spare bedroom into a game room for my friends, and we would play poker, DnD, scramble, whatever we wanted. I was so, so excited for our first meeting and my friends got me house warming gifts and chipped in for a nice meal. 

&#x200B;

As we started our poker game, I quicky realized that I was having spetacular bad luck. Which was really weird, considering how I managed to use poker winnings to feed myself lunch all through college (not a big winner, but mostly consistent pay outs). I just kept bleeding money. My friends commented on the situation, but overall weren't concerned. Just one of those days, I guess. 

&#x200B;

But it didn't end there. My losing streak continued all through my first month, not just poker either, in DnD I was getting single digit rolls for multiple sessions. I got all the crappy letters in scramble. Hell, I even managed to lose in bingo! 

&#x200B;

Near my second month there, my cousin and her friends came for a stay and I figured that maybe a change in players would be in my favor. My cousin set up the table while I went out to get some food. As we played, it became clear that luck was with my cousin. She sat across me, with her back to a cabinet. She won every. single. match.

&#x200B;

But it was clear that she didn't feel very well. She looked pale and clammy. When she finally stood up from the table, despite looking postitively nauseous, she insisted she was fine just needed to rest. She went to lie in my room and we continued playing. 

&#x200B;

Then something weird happened. The next person to sit in her seat also had a winning streak. I went to sit in her seat and I won. As did another friend of mine. 

&#x200B;

All of us were a bit weired out so we called it a day . I went to check up on my cousin and saw that she had fallen fast asleep. I checked her forehead and was relieved to find her temperature was normal.  

&#x200B;

After everyone had left, I went into the game room to put away the table, I realized something. When I set up the room, I always put table so that the four sides faced the corners of the room, that way the chairs would have more space and people could put food or drinks more easily. But the way my cousin set up the table, the four sides were parallel to the walls. This was the first time someone sat with their back to the cabinet. 

&#x200B;

The cabinet wasn't new. In fact, the spare room was the only place that wasn't refurnished. It wasn't to say it was shabby in any way, no. The furniture (the cabinent, a bookshelf and single reading chair) were all clean, and well taken care of. The dark wood even had a stately shine to it. The foldable gaming table and chairs were probably the cheapest things in there. 

 

I used the cabinet to store some of the lesser used board games and other this and thats. I pulled the cabinet open and nothing was out of the ordinary. Not that there was anything else to expect, honestly. Everything was right where they should be. 

&#x200B;

I put everything away and as I shut the lights, I swear that I heard a rap coming from the cabinet. Like someone rapped their knuckles on a wooden surface. I got a shiver go up my back, and I hurried back to my room.

&#x200B;

In the morning, I woke up to see my cousin looking incredibly haggard. She said that she had been trying to wake up for the past 2 hours. She had been experiencing sleep paralysis and although she felt that she was awake, her body just couldn't move. She had always been sensitive, and had trouble sleeping in new places. I chalked it up to that and took her out to eat. She had planned to stay for a week, but she left early after three days while I was at work due to an emergency. 

&#x200B;

I checked that cabinet a few more times, but I couldn't figure out what made the noise. All the board games were packed in their boxes, and the linens certainly couldn't have tapped anything. There was a the plug of a reading lamp, but that was nicely winded around lamp.

&#x200B;

Anyhow, that cabinet was the least of my worries. 

&#x200B;

During my second month there, I had started to sleep longer. I couldn't get up in the mornings. I had resorted to setting my alarms a few hours earlier, so I could get to work on time. I napped anytime I could. I just felt so tired all the time. For the first time in my life, I too, experienced sleep paralysis. I felt pinned in place, but I couldn't bring myself to care. I was too tired to move anyways. Rationally, the paralysis will pass and it didn't inconvenience me that much. 

&#x200B;

I complained to my brother, who was a therapist, and he said that it was probably strain from work, and that I was showing symptoms of burnout and depression. It made sense. Our game nights were also suffering and I hadn't called a gathering for a while. I had a new project at work that gave me far too many headaches for my paygrade. 

&#x200B;

One weekend afternoon, as I was lying on my bed, I must have dozed off. I had a strange dream. I dreamed that a dark figure had walked into the cabinet. Then I saw a dark shadow appear through the wall and it stood over me, with half of its body still in the wall. Just looking at me, though I couldn't see a face. How long I lay there, I didn't know, but it stood over me the whole time. 

&#x200B;

Then I woke up. I realized that the cabinet was on the other side of the wall. I got up and went into the game room. For a peace of mind, I pushed the cabinet to a different location. As I pushed, I heard the sound of a paper tearing and fluttering down. I bent down, and found a piece of yellow paper with strange red markings on the floor.  It had torn in half.

&#x200B;

That night, my friend came to visit. After eating dinner, he went to use the bathroom. He came out not a minute after, looking all startled. He said that he thought he saw a dark figure in the mirror. But then, he wasn't wearing glasses and already had a few drinks. It was most likely just him being tipsy. Keep in mind, apart from the dream, I hadn't seen any shadow figures at all. This was around the third month there.  

&#x200B;

By the fourth month, my coworkers were commenting on how pale and tired I looked. Myself, I felt that I slept better after I moved the cabinet away. And that I was in okay spirits. I had restarted the game nights and my friends were at my place often. I still had the occasional sleep paralysis, but by then I was almost accustomed to it. 

&#x200B;

One day, when I got to work, I was faced by an annoyed manager. She claimed that I never called her back. I was very confused, because I hadn't got any messages or phone calls. My manager said that she called me last night at 7, but my phone didn't have any records of any calls from that time frame. My manager then pulled out her phone and showed me that the call lasted 47 seconds.  She explained that a guy picked up my call for me. And told the manager that I was currently in the shower and that I would call her back.

&#x200B;

I was in the shower. But I was home alone. 

&#x200B;

After redialing the number, my phone started ringing, so it wasn't a weird coincidence and wrong phone number. Whats more, the person stated clearly my full name, like "Adam Quincey Sandler is in the shower right now."

&#x200B;

Needless to say I was more than weirded out. But I felt that apart from the weirdness, I was in a better place mentally. So I pushed the incident aside and went about my every day life.

&#x200B;

There were still a few strange occurences that happened that made me make up my mind to leave, I'll share when I have more time.
