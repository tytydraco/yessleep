I should preface this by saying that, while I know how completely insane this sounds, it’s still really getting to me. I’ve heard this place is good for stories like this, so I thought I’d share my experiences here.

It started, like most things do, when I was bored. I don’t have the best impulse control, so I went shopping online. Mostly for dumb gag items that didn’t really do anything, or ‘magic’ items that people sold at exorbitant prices online. Fake stuff that didn’t really work or the like. On that search, though, I found an 8 ball at an extremely low price. It simply read, “REAL MAGIC 8 BALL. DON’T WANT IT ANYMORE.” and was exactly 1 cent, with free shipping. That was weird, but, then again, if someone wanted to scam me out of a penny, then they probably had bad enough things going on in their life. I bought it. The worst that could happen is that it didn’t show up, and most other scenarios were just it being some broken magic 8 ball, which would still make for a great decoration.

All this is to say, I made the choice on a whim, and forgot about it for a few weeks. When it arrived at my door, I had almost completely forgotten about it. The package itself was really cheap (but that wasn’t all too surprising, since they paid for shipping out of pocket), but when I opened it, everything checked out. There was, in fact, a magic 8 ball in there, which did seem to have a functioning die inside of it. It also came with a note that came with a list of instructions.

“Hello \[My real, full name\], I hope this package finds you well. My listing wasn’t exactly specific, so I’ll tell you what you’re dealing with now. This ball allows you to ask any question, and as long as someone can see you, it’ll give you an answer from their perspective. (EX: ask if you’re a good person, it’ll tell you what the person thinks) It’ll only tell you what a normal magic 8 ball will, though, so I found it pretty impractical. It’s a fun novelty, but since it wore off so soon, I wanted to give it to someone else.”

I found the note strange. Or, it could be the benefit of hindsight telling me I wasn’t getting the full story, but I digress. I kind of just let this note sit in my room for a while, and forgot about it completely, save for the ‘powers’ it said the ball had.

Of course, I decided to ask a bunch of regular questions, things like if I’ll get a million dollars, if I’ll get a promotion, or other questions you tinker with. But, every time I did so, it always came back with “Cannot predict now,” which I guess was the closest thing it had to an “I don’t know” This made sense. Kind of. If it was reading my mind, then of course I wouldn’t know if anything like that would happen.

So, I decided to try something a bit more solvable. I asked if I liked listening to music, and it said “It is certain,” then I asked questions about more intimate matters, “Is my mom still alive,” or “Do I ever regret doing that”. And, no matter how many curveballs I’d seem to throw, it never once faltered. A magic 8 ball saying things I already knew wasn’t the most useful thing, though, so I knew I’d have to test it with people.

The next day, at work, I brought the ball in, made direct eye contact with someone I wasn’t all too familiar with, and asked questions about the same things I had asked myself. It came back with vaguer ideas of the picture, with more cautious “My sources say no,” and “signs point to yes,” among a sea of “Cannot predict now”s.

Of course, once I was given this power, I decided to abuse it. I asked questions about if my coworkers would focus, and the more certain I was they wouldn’t notice, the more I decided to prank them. Yes, I know, it is terrible of me, but I really couldn’t help myself.

But, this is all just a small preamble compared to what happened later. I was at my house, tending to small, menial chores to keep myself occupied (as I always do), and I decided to mess around with the 8 ball again. There was something fun about being able to see things about your own life that you otherwise wouldn’t think about, and trying to stump the 8 ball.

I asked one question, “Do I look cute today?” (I thought I looked like a mess. There was also something funny about being called ugly by a magic 8 ball, is that so wrong?), and it responded “Without a doubt.” This alone wasn’t weird, though it was different than what usually happened when I asked it that.

“Did I have a good day today?”

“Cannot predict now”

I felt uneasy, but I felt like I had to ask another question, “Did I go to work today?”

“It is certain”

“Am I at home?”

“It is certain”

“Was I followed?”

“Signs point to yes”

“Who followed me?”

“Reply hazy, try again”

I briefly forgot about the limitations of the ball, but my mind was panicking so much I couldn’t think.

“Will I be seen if I hide in the bathroom?” (it’s the one room in my house without windows.)

“Very doubtful.”

I called the police after I hid in the bathroom, but I’m still in here long after that phone call, asking questions to this stupid ball. I feel like I’m overreacting, but after such a long streak of correct guesses, I’m not the only one who thinks this way, right?
