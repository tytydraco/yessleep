m40 here, throwaway.

So, today as I was going for a coffee I decided to check out a new Cafè that just opened. As I go near the door I am surprised and happy to see an ex girlfriend of mine from when I was a kid.  
We stare at each other for a second and then I see she mumbles something and then comes towards me.  
I go in for the hug, and after we greet she just says "Do you remember what you've done to me?"

I was baffled. We dated many many years ago and we never had issues of any kind. No major fights, no abuse, no toxicity, as a matter of fact she left me because I would not commit but remained on good terms for a while after, still hanging out, until she found a job abroad and left.  
At first I was scared shitless and immediately thought there was something strange. I asked to be more specific but she wasn't telling. After a little chit chat she told me she was referring to the time me and a friend "cleansed" her house.  
It came back to me then: at the time we were stupid edgy semi goth kids really into the paranormal. After she complained about feeling her house was "weird", a friend from our group offered to do some cleansing ritual, which he did while we were basically half drunk.  
According to her, when 7 years later she talked about this thing with other people, shit started to hit the fan. Like you could feel presence around the house, drops of temperature, all the good stuff. She was very vague but apparently she believes some kind of ghost is now possessing her house, something apparently unleashed after that thing we did and she started telling about it to her friends, because nothing happened in the years prior. She then got back to England but promptly came back here to escape from an abusive fiancée.

At that point I was really nervous and I excused myself. She hugged me, says now there is only Christ in her heart, and that we should really have a cup of coffee. This gave me really weird vibes, like weird cult stuff.  
I... basically ran away terrified.

  
Keep in mind: we split on good terms, very good. She looked after my dog while I was in England. As a masseuse she took care of my bad back for months. She even introduced me to her new boyfriend and we went out for dinner a couple of times, as a group. There is no way she could’ve held animus against me, hell once abroad she even offered to help find a job for me in the city she was currently living in. This was not a prank done to get back at me. And moreso, her eyes. She once was the light of the room, always laughing and cracking jokes. The prson I found was sad, with very still eyes, not smiling, not anything. Like a completely different person.
