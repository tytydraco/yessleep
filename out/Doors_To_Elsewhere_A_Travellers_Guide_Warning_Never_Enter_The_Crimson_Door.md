Hello everyone! It's been a while since I've been here. I don't mean here on Reddit, but rather on this side of the Earth Door. I'm sure to most of you that statement doesn't make sense, so allow me to introduce myself and explain. My name is Marik. I am what you would call a Door-to-Door traveler. I have the ability to see special Doors, which lead to other dimensions. 

There are others like me, but we're pretty rare. I've traveled to many places throughout the years, and I've never really spoken with anyone about them besides my mother. Since this seems like a community to share strange and spooky stories, I figured this would be the perfect time and place to share one, but to do that, I need to start from the beginning.

It started when I was in the 9th grade. One day, as I was walking to class with some friends, I noticed a strange Door on the wall. I had never noticed it before, and it looked abnormal. Instead of having 90-degree angles, it looked like it had been put through a fun house mirror, with obtuse and acute edges all around its frame. I walked over to it and put my hand against it. Immediately, it swung open, and I was bathed in the color of wonder. In front of me was a giant space going up and down forever. Far below was another strangely shaped Door. In shock, I gasped and fell backwards. My friends came over and asked me what was wrong. I pointed at the Door, and asked them where it had come from. They looked at me strangely and asked

“What Door?” 

I gestured towards it, but now it was gone, replaced by an empty wall. I gave a small chuckle, mumbling about being tired, and went on with my day. I figured it was just a one-off instance, but I was wrong. As the days went on, I began seeing random Doors in places they shouldn't be, like flat on sidewalks, high up on unreachable walls, or even along the corners of rooms. They were always so bright and would sometimes hurt my eyes, and each time, I was the only one who could see them. I began to think I was going crazy, thinking it was some genetic mental disorder that was starting to manifest. I was afraid to tell my mom, so I did my best to ignore it, but eventually, there were so many that I could barely focus on school. So one morning in tears, I ran up to my mother and told her I thought my eyes were messed up or that there was something wrong with my head, because I was seeing strange, bright Doors everywhere. I expected her to be concerned or alarmed, but instead, she closed her eyes and took a sip from her coffee.

“You aren't going crazy, dear, don't worry.”

In obvious confusion, I asked her what she meant. She put down her cup and smiled at me.

“Because I see them too.”

Door-sight is what she called it. She didn't give it that name; the government did. In the 80s, they ran an operation called “Beyond The Veil”. They discovered the Doors' existence and that only some people could see and open them. So they went around and gathered up a bunch of “Door-seers”. Then they began running experiments to see why some people could see them and why some couldn't, and to explore what lay beyond them. My mother knew all this because she was one of the people rounded up. Eventually, the operation was canceled when they found some other method to find and open them, something my mother said they called an “Orius”, and so they gave her money and swore her to secrecy. 

There were theories that the sight could be passed down, and now this was confirmation. My mother said that the sight would eventually stabilize and I would be able to control which Doors I wanted to see, but also warned not to explore any of them until I was older. She traveled a lot when she was younger, and learned that some Doors were best left closed, at least until you were ready to see what was on the other side. Of course, with me being young and believing I was invincible, I didn't listen. I would sometimes open smaller doors and give a little peek. Most of them just led to random places in our world, while some rare ones led to places that couldn't exist here.

With all that exposition out of the way, I'll now tell you about my first and worst big trip. This happened long ago, and since then, I have heeded my mother's words much more strictly, and if you are a new “Door-seer,” then heed my words too. Never, under any circumstances, should you ever enter “The Crimson Door.”

A year after I gained the sight, I had learned how to control it enough that I could filter how many Doors I saw at a given time. I also learned they followed certain rules. Every Door had a time limit on how long it would stay in one place. Some would be around for days, while others a few seconds. Doors also always lie flat against a surface, regardless of whether it is rounded, sharp, or flat. I say all this to display how odd The Crimson Door was. One night, it appeared in the middle of our backyard, floating in the air instead of being attached to something. Its deep, bright crimson glow penetrated my upstairs window. It was foreboding, almost like it was trying to lure me in. The Door remained there for weeks, which was the longest one had ever stayed in place. Another rule the Doors always followed was that they cycled through some random palette of 3 colors, like orange, green, and blue, or purple, white, and yellow. This Door remained that haunting crimson. 

The final strange thing about it was that my mother couldn't see it. She warned me not to enter it, saying anomalies like that were bound to lead to somewhere horrific, but I'm sure you can guess what happened. Late one night, I tossed some snacks and water into a bag, put on my raincoat, and snuck out of the house. The Door was larger than most, easily about 7 to 8 feet tall. There was some kind of repetitive noise coming from it, and it felt like it was looking at me. I figured I'd only be gone for a little bit, and only grabbed the bag to make myself feel like a true adventurer. I figured once I was done exploring a bit, I'd get back to bed before Mom noticed a thing. I took a deep breath and pushed it open. My body was immediately ripped inside, and I blacked out from the force.

My vision blurred as I woke up. My neck hurt from the whiplash, and my head pounded from hitting it against the ground. When my vision finally cleared, I realized I was in the middle of a dark hallway with closed normal doors lining it. The hallway curved slightly in the distance, preventing me from seeing the end. Each door had a pulsing crimson glow coming from under it. The hallway was silent, and there was an eerie chill in the air. I picked myself up and tightened my coat around myself. I turned around to find the Door, but all I found was more hallway. The Door was nowhere in sight. I thought about calling out, but I figured it would be smarter to explore in silence, so I turned back around and began walking. As I walked along, sometimes that repetitive noise would come from one of the doors, and a shadow would appear underneath it. Instinctively, I would try to move away from it and stay still. Eventually, the noise and shadow would go away. I repeated this pattern until, finally, I saw a bright red light beyond the curve of the hallway. When I reached it, I found myself in some kind of basement.

The basement looked somewhat unfinished, and had two doorless hallways to the left and right of me, and a staircase in front of me. The left one led into another long hallway that had no end in sight, while the right one led to some sort of pit, with a giant dark hallway behind it. In that darkness, I swore I saw something moving. I craned my neck and saw something staring back at me, which caused me to jump and immediately run up the stairs. 

I then found myself in an unfinished lobby. To my right was what looked like a check-in desk, but it wasn't fully painted. Past that was another staircase that went to a higher floor. In front of me were giant windows and a large glass door that opened out into a forest. Though the trees obscured the sky, the crimson glow seemed to be beaming down from it. I walked to the center of the room and looked down. On the floor was a strange collage of unrecognizable symbols and odd paintings, depicting tall red figures with hollow eyes. There seemed to be people bowing to them, and a smaller figure holding up their hand with a strange symbol on it. 

“What the fuck is this?” I thought as I continued to study it. Suddenly, that repetitive sound started again. It was coming from all around me, and the crimson glow began to get brighter. Then the noise shifted from all around me to directly above me. I slowly looked up to the source.

Eyes. Countless crimson eyes stared down at me. Long red humanoids with pinprick crimson eyes within hollow sockets, and long mouths with more crimson eyes moving around inside stared into me. They clung to red vein-like web-looking things in a tunnel that went upwards high into an abyss. The ceiling within the upward tunnel was impossible to see, and those things continued to emerge from the impossible heights, each one with long, haunting gaping maws and so many eyes within. One of them slowly began reaching its long limb towards me. It had warped fingers that shifted like an illusion; sometimes there were three fingers, other times there were ten. My eyes began to roll, and that repetitive sound got louder. The creature grabbed my face and began feeling around. I couldn't move. The creature began to fill my mind with visions of a large group of people surrounded by these things, with each one having crimson eyes and leaking a glowing, iridescent red liquid from their bodies. In the center of them all was a girl with bright red hair, brownish crimson streaked eyes, and a symbol on her hand. It looked just like the paintings. 

The creature lifted me off the ground, bringing me closer to its face as it began to open its mouth wide and began to pry mine open. A bunch of eyes moved around within its mouth, and a smaller creature began to crawl out and latched onto its arm. It then began slowly crawling towards my open mouth. Another vision flashed before me, this time of my mother entering the Crimson Door, distraught and calling for me. She climbs the stairs and sees me, standing in the middle of this room, with deep crimson eyes and a disgusting smile.

That vision snapped me from freeze to fight or flight. Right as the thing reached my mouth, I punched the bigger one's arm, causing it to let go, and I fell to the ground. The little creature fell too, making a loud squelching thud. The big one let out a noise that I can only describe as something we aren't meant to hear. With flight in full effect and nowhere to go but forward, I whipped my body around and began running towards the lobby door. With all my might, I burst through the glass and ran blindly into the forest ahead.

I tripped multiple times as I ran through the forest. The light of the crimson sky illuminated my path just enough that I didn't smash headfirst into any of the dark trees. I didn't stop until the adrenaline began to wear off and a sharp pain shot through my leg, causing me to fall over. I shifted into a sitting position and checked my leg. There was a glass shard just below my knee, and blood leaked from the wound. I had a few other cuts on my hands and other leg, but none of them were as deep and bloody as this one. Now the pain was beginning to peak, and I bit my lip hard to prevent myself from screaming. I reached into my backpack and pulled out an apple. I shoved it into my mouth, bit down hard, and painfully pulled the shard out. I used my water to try to clean the cut, and then took my coat off and wrapped it around the gash the best I could. I drank the remaining water and sprinkled a little on my other cuts. My mother was right. I shouldn’t have come here. I looked back toward the way I came. 

“Maybe the Door was in the other direction of that hallway.” I thought. “Ain't no way in hell I'm going back there.”

I used a nearby log to push myself up. The pain in my leg was unbearable, so I found a trusty stick and used it as a crutch. I knew if those things followed me, I'd be a sitting duck, so I prayed to whatever God was listening to help me get through this and get home. After I finished, much slower now, I pushed my way through the rest of the forest. When I finally reached the treeline, I collapsed to the ground. I felt so tired, and the thought of sleep felt appealing. I rolled over to look up at the sky and felt my heart stop. I quickly crawled back into the trees and lay still. 

“I shouldn’t have come here!” I thought as I looked up at the sky.

The source of the pulsing crimson was now revealed. A giant crimson orb hung high in the sky. It was like a giant meteor that blocked out the sun. Countless red figures moved around on its surface. From this distance, they looked small, but there was no mistaking the form of those accursed creatures. The orb hung over what looked like some kind of college campus. The words “B.R. University Main Hall” were engraved on one of the large buildings. For a moment, I considered just staying hidden in the trees. Maybe nightfall would come, and then I could move, assuming nightfall existed here. Pain shot through my leg again, and I looked down. While the coat seemed to be slowing down the bleeding, blood still leaked from underneath it. I now had a time limit. I cursed and looked back towards the campus. It seemed the treeline extended to some of the nearby buildings. 

“If I can just sneak along the trees, I should be able to take cover under some of the buildings.” I thought.

I knew eventually I'd have to go out in the open, but maybe by then I could find someone who could help me, or maybe get lucky enough to find the Door, whichever came first.

“Should have listened to Mom!” My conscience berated me.

After playing Mission Impossible and sidling along the trees and edges of buildings, I managed to reach what looked like the campus's center. There was a statue of a man with a little girl with long hair standing next to him. The pain in my leg had started to decrease, but dizziness had started to come and go. 

“I have to hurry.” I thought.

Then I heard someone talking, and I immediately hid behind a nearby bush. Coming up the path was a hooded person in strange, dark blue robes. They seemed to be talking to themselves. I remembered the image of those people from that painting, bowing to those red things. I did not want to talk to them, but I needed medical attention. 

“Maybe they're cool?” I thought. “Surely seeing a kid in danger will make them want to help me.”

16-year-old Marik was pretty naive. My mother always told me not to judge a book by its cover, so I figured even though this person was surely crazy, maybe they'd have some humanity within them.

“Hey!” I called out and stood up. The figure jumped and stopped muttering. “I'm sorry to scare you. I got injured.” I showed my leg wrapped in the coat. “Look, I just need some medical supplies or something, and then I'll be on my…”

The figure lifted a finger to where its mouth was and made a shush motion with it. They then lowered their hood. Underneath was a woman with grey hair tied up into a strange bun. She wore strange glasses that hid her eyes. She looked like an older woman, thought it would be impolite to guess her age. She lowered her finger and then called out,

“Oooooh Illesia!”

The sound of rhythmic skipping came from somewhere to my left. I turned and saw another smaller hooded figure approaching us.  

“Yes, mother?!” The figure responded in a higher-pitched voice that sounded like a young girl.

“You missed one, dear. You told me you indoctrinated everyone on campus.” The little figure looked in my direction.

“But I did. This one's new. I don't recognize him.”

The older woman glanced back at me. 

“Where did you come from?” I blinked and stared at both of them.

“Look, I'm just trying to go home or stop myself from bleeding out. Can you please help me?”

“Where is home? How did you get here?” The woman responded stoically.

I sighed with frustration and pointed toward the forest, 

“I came from that way.”

“The dorms? Interesting. And how did you get there?” The woman asked.

“Look, lady…” I said, and suddenly my head swam. I leaned on my stick to regain balance. I was running out of time. “Please… I don't want to die…”

“If you answer my question, I may be able to help you.” She said. I sighed again. 

“Look, it won't make sense, but I came through a Door, OK?”

“The Crimson Door? So it appeared somewhere new.” She mused. I stared dumbly,

“Yeah sure, can you help me now? Do you know where the Door is? Or a hospital?”

The lady pointed at the big building with “B.R. Main Hall” written on it. 

“The Crimson Door usually appears somewhere in there, and as for a hospital, we have one close by that we can take you to. There's just one thing we have to do first.” I felt relieved. 

“OK, yeah, what's that?” She gestured to the smaller figure. 

“Illesia needs to indoctrinate you.” 

The smaller figure pulled down their hood, revealing a girl who looked a little younger than me, maybe 12 or 13 (compared to me being 16). She had fiery red hair and ominous light brown eyes, with a streak of crimson in both irises. She wore a strange smile that caused fear to shoot through me. She looked like the girl from the vision. I looked back at the woman. 

“That's okay. I think I'll just go find the Door on my own.” The lady shook her head.

“You misunderstand. It was not an offer. Regardless of how you got here, you are now a part of us. I can see the Crimson touched you, which means you need to be indoctrinated. Don't worry, if you come willingly, Illesia won't hurt you too badly.”

“What the hell!?” I said and began to try to stumble past her, but my head swam again, and I tripped. The lady caught me.

“Mom, can we make it fun? Give him a chance to run. I want more practice. Let's give him a head start.”

The lady stared at me and smiled. She stood me up and put my makeshift crutch back under my arm. 

“OK, I think that's fair. How much of a head start? Ten, fifteen seconds?”

“Five minutes,” I mumbled.

“Too long,” Illesia said. “How about twenty seconds? I think that's fair.”

“Twenty it is.” The woman said and let me go. “Best get moving.”

“ONE!”

I began hobbling towards the building. 

“Good idea, Marik. Next time judge THE CRAZY NUTCASES IN STUPID ROBES!” I yelled.

“TWO!”

Trying to move faster caused more pain.

“THREE!”

“FOUR!”

“FIVE!”

“SIX!”

Halfway to the building. I kept pushing, forcing my body forward the best I could.

“SEVEN!”

“EIGHT!”

“NINE!”

“TEN!”

I began to trip and fall as I reached the building's entrance. I rightened myself and tried to open it. 

“Locked!” I cursed.

“ELEVEN!”

“TWELVE!”

“THIRTEEN!” 

“FOURTEEN!”

I bashed the wood against the glass door, using all the strength I had. Out of anger, I then grabbed a rock and began smacking it against the glass.

“FIFTEENTH!”

“SIXTEEN!”

The glass began to crack, and I gave one final heave, putting all my power into it.

“SEVENTEEN!”

The glass shattered. I used the wood to knock away any major shards to prevent further cuts.

“EIGHTEEN!”

I pushed myself inside. My leg was about to give out again, and my vision was starting to dim.

“NINETEEN…”

The lady hadn't said what floor the Door was on. I knew I'd have to begin my search on this floor. I began getting as far away as I could from the entrance.

“TWENTY!” I heard as I rounded the corner.

The hallway was just like the basement one, dark and crimson. It was split into three parts. The part I had just come from, the one I was in, and one that turned to the left at the end. I hobbled and searched each door. All of them looked normal. I knew I'd recognise the Door when I saw it.

As I reached the end of the hallway and began to turn left, I heard the crunch of glass come from the front entrance. At the end of this hall was a staircase, and so I scrambled to it and went up as silently as I could. I began to hear the gleeful chuckles of the deranged child echoing through the halls. I decided I'd try to check the higher floors first and then work my way down, hopefully avoiding my stalker as she checked one by one. I made it to the sixth floor and began walking down the halls. Everything looked the same here. My head was spinning, and my vision was going in and out of focus.

“Hurry…” I thought.

I made it to the end of the floor and slowly approached the opposite staircase. I didn't hear anything below, so I quietly walked to the fifth floor and began walking up the hallway.

CRACK!

Just around the corner ahead, I heard the splinter of glass.

“Where are you??” Illesia said in a sweet, singsong voice. 

I felt my heart jump, and I silently pushed open a nearby door. 

“Why did she check this floor?!” I thought.

“You know, Indoctrination isn't so bad. I did it when I was younger. That's why I'm so good at doing it to others! It'll only hurt for a little bit, and then you won't feel a thing.”

I held my breath as I heard her approach my door. 

“You didn't close this door all the way. Are you even trying?”

I moved to the right side of the door and pressed my back against the wall as it swung open towards me. Her fiery hair flashed in the small door window, and as she moved in, it looked like two red spotlights moved with her, like she had two red flashlights in her head. She then looked to the left.  

“Not over here…”

She walked in a little more and stared at the far wall. 

“Not over there…” She giggled and began to turn towards me. “That means you must be over here…” I shut my eyes tight and began to pray again.

Then a loud thud sounded from below us. Illesia stopped turning and looked into the hallway. 

“So the open door was a distraction…Clever…” She muttered and walked back into the hall, slowly walking towards the stairs.

I let out a breath and waited. Once her footsteps were gone, I silently walked back into the hallway. I knew this could be a trap, but I was semi-conscious, carried on by will. While it was hard to tell where the thud came from, I figured she'd check the fourth floor below, so I stumbled to the third. 

My vision began to close in on the sides as I walked the third-floor hall. My leg felt so cold, and I was beginning to shiver. 

“Left foot, right foot. Nothing down the first hall. Second…”

I lost my footing and fell. I was out of energy. The rest of my body was becoming cold, and I felt numb. I began to think of Mom. 

“Sorry, I didn't listen…”

In my fading sight, I saw something glint off the floor. I lifted my head slightly. The floor was reflecting a light, brighter than the rest, a bright, deep crimson color. I lifted my head and saw my salvation. The Crimson Door floated at the end of the hall. In a moment of renewed will, I began crawling towards it. I had done it. I was going to make it. A shadow then moved behind the Door, halting me just a foot away from it. I looked past the Door and felt my heart jump. One of those horrid crimson creatures hung onto the outside window, its mouth wide open in a horrific smile, and its deep crimson pinprick eyes within its hollow socket bore into me with glee. 

“Found you.”

I felt myself get ripped backwards, and I rolled onto my back. The blurry image of Illesia stood above me. Her eyes were the color of the giant orb outside. Her body looked a little different, almost longer, but only slightly. She still looked human, but wrong somehow. 

“Don't feel bad. You did pretty well for someone in your condition. You may have even gotten away if it wasn't for my friend over there. That noise diversion was a neat touch, though. For a moment, I really doubted you were in that room. You'll have to tell me how you did it once we're done! Don't worry, like I said, indoctrination won't hurt too badly, at least not for long.”

Her blurry hand began to glow, and a strange greenish symbol appeared. She pressed it against my chest, and that's when the pain began. A powerful jolt tightened my limbs, which paralyzed me, and my veins began to glow green. She then grabbed onto my temples, which sent shockwaves of pain throughout my skull, causing me to start yelling. All I could see was her dark crimson eyes, and those creatures, which had begun to appear around her, staring at me with their haunting gaze. I think they were hallucinations, but their forms were vivid. The repetitive noise started as they all opened their disgusting, long mouths, and the eyes inside them moved around in a frenzy. At the back of each of their throats was another set of eyes that didn't move. Those eyes looked human. The tiny creatures began to crawl out and come towards me. Something was beginning to enter me through my temples. It felt like an intrusive thought, only it didn't belong to me. The pain had also started to fade, but that only scared me more. It meant whatever this “indoctrination” was, was about to end. 

“Wh-what's going to hap-pen to me? Am I go-going t-t-to die?” I stuttered through the pain. She looked down at me with pity.

“No, you won't die.” Her face then changed to a dark smile. “You'll become just like me.”

I tried to fight her, but was too weak, both from her strength and my blood loss. Tears began to flow as I thought of my mother.

“Mom, I'm sorry I didn't listen…” I cried.  “I'm so sorry…”

The hallucinations were getting stronger because I saw a new form appear behind Illesia. The form looked human, and they were wielding…A bat? 

CRACK!

The creatures and thoughts disappeared, and the pain ceased as Illesia was knocked off me by the force of a wooden bat. The figure then reached down and began to pull me up.

“Come on.” A muffled, distant voice yelled at me. In my haze, I could just barely make it out.

“Mom…” I mumbled. 

I felt myself lift to my feet, and I was slung over her shoulder. She tossed the bat aside and put her hand on the door, and it swung open. The figure of Illesia picked itself up and emitted a high-pitched, angry scream. Her form stretched again, and her face began to morph. I was glad I couldn't make out the details. The Illesia thing crossed the distance in a matter of seconds, but it was too late for her. My mother turned towards it and grabbed the door, causing a handle to manifest. Without another word, Mom pulled it, and the door slammed shut as we tumbled backwards into the grass of our yard. 

That was when I blacked out. I woke up a week later in the hospital. Apparently, I was more injured than I thought. My leg required some major stitches, and they had been pumping me with antibiotics, because the gash and a few other glass cuts had become infected. I also had a minor concussion. Mom stayed by my bed the entire time. She didn't say anything about what happened until we got home.

“I told you not to go into that Door! I've been doing this for a long time, so I know what I'm talking about! You could have died!”

“I'm sorry…” was all I could say. “How did you find me? I thought you said you couldn't see the Door.”

She sighed. “Of course, I could see it. I thought saying that would unsettle you enough to leave it alone. I had a dream of finding you possessed by one of those creatures, and I immediately knew you had entered it. Thankfully, it exited out into that building. My “mother” senses told me you were in danger, so I kicked some stuff over to cause a distraction. I’m glad that ended up working.”

“Will they follow us?”

“No. I closed the door. You have to enter a Door once in order to close it, or someone else has to enter it. You going in was a blessing in disguise, because now the Door is gone and it won't reappear here again, but do not think of that as an excuse to do this again. You will tell me from now on if you're going to Door-hop, and I will either go with you, or if I forbid you to go through one, you don't. Understand!?”

“Yes, Mom.”

And that's it. That's how my first Door-to-Door travel went. Over the many years since then, I have mastered my abilities. I haven't seen the Crimson Door since, and I hope I never have to again. I still have a scar on my leg that acts as a reminder of that day. For the most part, I've been able to move on, but sometimes, despite the extensive therapy, I'll dream about that red-haired girl, staring at me with those deep crimson eyes, and she'd smile at me, sometimes saying, 

“Found you!”, while at other times saying,

 “I see you!”, all in that damn singsong voice and wave at me as I wake up. 

I'd dismiss it as trauma, but the strange thing is, I haven't seen her since that day, yet in my dreams, her age changes. She's never younger than when I first saw her, but sometimes she'd be a few years older, while other times she'd be far older than me. Obviously, it could just be my mind playing tricks, but then I'd wake up, and I'd feel a burning in my temples and lower jaw where that thing pulled, which remains until I’m fully awake. When it first started, I'd even find slick, glowing crimson liquid on my pillow.

The liquid stopped long ago, and those dreams are a rarity nowadays. I try not to think about it, since all of that was decades ago.

Anyways, thanks for listening to my tale. Maybe someday I'll come back to tell other tales, but for now, for those other Door-to-Door travelers, heed my Mother's and my warning. Do not enter any Doors that stay one color, or if possible, always enter with a partner. You may not be as lucky as I, getting saved at the last moment. And of course, avoid the Crimson Door at all costs. That girl is still out there, and I'm sure she'll be happier to see you than you would be to see her.
