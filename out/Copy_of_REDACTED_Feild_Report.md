BEGIN REPORT: 8:39 PM
  

  
This is field agent Adrian Bedal reporting from Elkhart Field Research Unit, estimated 14 Miles outside of Elkhart Indiana. I have been assigned to time-sensitive Operation 16-B51 and arrived on site at 8:39 PM. Renner briefed me on the operation but told me very little in terms of specifics. It is my understanding a field research unit was dispatched to Southern Indiana as a tactical response to various sightings of FLORA in the area. All of those that reported sightings have been taken into MESSIAH custody and have been PROCESSED. 
  

  
A Hot-Spot has formed around the wilderness areas of ELKHART Indiana with sightings stretching all the way to TERRE-HAUTE. Nearly 79 Miles South of the confirmed FLORA zone. 
  
I initially suspected these to be false reports, which are common. Although thermal imaging cameras have confirmed the presence of FLORA. I expect this to be a somewhat common phenomenon known as GHOST-HEAT, where low-level paranormal entities can be visible in certain areas. While this is concerning to Civilians and local law enforcement, it's just another day in the office for MESSIAH. 
  

  
While being relatively harmless, the presence of PARANORMAL entities of any caliber can cause extreme fear, stress, and paranoia in local communities. Being the senior Field-Agent in the responding area, I am to conduct a standard 14-650 SEANCE to dispel all of our uninvited guests. I will be taking four members of our ACT team with me for support in the event of the FLORA sighting being legitimate.

ARRIVAL: 9:17 PM
  

  
As we approached the trailhead that leads to SITE-001 a meteorological phenomenon was spotted in the sky. A strange discoloration was examined by all members of the Unit. Operator-WILKES had mentioned that it somewhat resembled that of the northern lights, and that is about the best way we could think to describe it. Unlike the Northern Lights, the coloration was that of a deep and beautiful purple paired with a vibrant blood-red backdrop. We stood in full view of this for approximately three minutes before it suddenly vanished, and the stars of the night sky could be seen again. 
  

  
While this sort of Phenomena is not completely uncommon to observe, it's the first time I've reported more than one Phenomenon in the same geographical location as another. While this is somewhat concerning I have still advised we carry on with the objective. I hypothesize that when all Specter Class entities have been cleared of the area the phenomena will cease. 
  

  
Further up the trail, we observed what I believe to be evidence of some sort of small ritual. Deer skulls, teeth, and various other remains are all tied tightly together with improvised black twine. While the instruments used would suggest this to be of Wiccan origin, the amount of care involved is astonishing. The black twine upon closer investigation appears to be human hair. I believe this furthers my theory that we are not dealing with KETER class FLORA but simply a spirit or spirits that have been brought back to these woods. 
  

  
We will proceed as planned to our objective with extreme caution. The sooner we chase these shadows out of the woods the sooner things can go back to normal for the locals. Once interest in this event has decreased we can begin the process of REDACTED, and the locals can begin to forget.

EMERGENCY ENTRY: 1:27 AM
  

  
I was wrong. For the first time in my 19-year career with MESSIAH, these sightings are NOT false. These woods are infested with FLORA. While en route to SITE-441, we were blind-sided by three massive FLORA, bigger than any depicted in our training. We didn't even hear them until they were on top of us. Operator-WILWIN and Operator-CHILDS were K.I.A in less than 30 seconds. Operator-MESA thought quickly and dispersed MESSIAH-issued TRUNK-Canisters in an attempt to safeguard our retreat. Unfortunately, the canister's effects were minimal. These FLORA are very different from anything we have experienced. 
  

  
While retreating Operator-WILKES spotted an abandoned Lumber Mill and suggested we take refuge until reinforcements can arrive. I have attempted to contact HQ tirelessly since our arrival at the mill with no success. I suspect this forest is too dense for our signal to escape.

 I have attempted to use the EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM but the fucking thing keeps saying it's offline. I don't understand it, the goddamn thing is supposed to work in any condition. This is what it was created for for fucks sake. We have barricaded ourselves into the office portion of the mill. The reinforcements are improvised, to say the least, and judging by the size of those florae it will not prevent their entry. We are all doing what we can to remain calm, but we can hear them out there. Screaming out to us in voices too horrible to describe. 
  

  

  
MONDAY, MAY 1. 2020: 
  

  
EMERGENCY ENTRY: 3:00 AM (REPORT COMPRISED OF INTERPRETED AUDIO)
  

  
E.A.S SIGNAL PENDING:  LAT:35 N LON: 030 W
  

  
SEND! SEND! SEND! What the fuck is wrong with this thing? HQ if you can hear me DO NOT send support units to this location. They found us, they waited until we had our guard down. Operator WILKES saw it first. A frail, bewildered-looking woman stumbled out of the tree line and onto the gravel of the mill. She appeared to be badly injured. WILKES mentioned a massive laceration across her abdomen, but she couldn't have sustained it from a FLORA. We all saw what those things can do, for god's sake it tore CHILDs in half without making a noise. She did not appear to be a threat. What stumbled out behind her we never could have expected
  

  

  

  
From out of the fog came Operator WILKES and Operator CHILDS. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. The man whose torso I personally had observed to be separated from the rest of his body was now fifteen feet away from us. Along with that of a man who had been decapitated before the entire unit. The three of them walked in near unison toward the front of the office. They stood there for just a moment before they called out to us. “Hey! Bedal! We got a hurt girl out here! The three of us sat in terror, not believing what we were seeing and trying desperately not to make a sound. 
  

  
We watched out the window as they continued to call out to us. Calmly at first but growing more impatient. “Guys! Quit fucking around! Get the fuck out here so we can go! We need to get this girl to a doctor!” Operator MARTIN began to sweat profusely and appeared to be extremely affected by this display. I think MARTIN had a deeper connection with Operator-WILKES than that of a co-worker, it is my understanding that they have been on countless tasks together and had saved one another's lives on multiple occasions, and because of that she started to believe what that thing out there was saying to us. As cold as it seems, there is a reason that agency friendships and interaction outside of work are strictly prohibited.
  

  
It all happened so fast, the screaming started. First the howls of an army of FLORA approaching from behind the Operators and the woman in the gravel. Then they began begging. “Please let us in bedal! Those things are gonna tear us to shreds! For real this time!” Operator DANIELS and I exchanged a look as if to confirm that we were not falling for this act. “Please WILKES, don't let me fucking die out here!” Our eyes were so trained on the men in the courtyard that we didn't notice Operator-WILKES stand up and rush to the door. She ran up to the filing cabinet blocking the office door and began to push it over. By the time we realized what was happening it was too late.
  

  
As soon as that filing cabinet hit the ground they were on us. The Operators and the woman in the courtyard...they..they turned. They were just waiting to pin down our location so they didn't have to hunt. A long and sickeningly white arm burst through the window of the office door, grabbing WILKES by her face and….and just...took it. As effortless as ripping a sheet of paper. The arm pulled WILKES face off of her skull. She collapsed into a heap and tried to scream, but all that came out was a soft gurgling sound. She stared at me for a moment that seemed to stretch on for years, looking at me with those horrified and lidless eyes. 
  

  
INPUT MODE SWITCHED TO MANUAL 
  

  
DANiels only managed to fire off a few shots before he was ripped through the window by four long white arms tipped with razor-sharp claws the color of obsidian. The only reason I made it out of the office and onto the production floor was the distraction the operators provided. I made it to the break room on the west side of the plant, but I can't risk making any noise. I don't hear any screams coming from the office area of the plant, so I can only hope that the deaths of WILKES and DANIELS were quick. I'm almost sure I will be meeting the same fate before the sun can rise. If I listen hard I can hear scuffling coming from the production floor, and what sounds like someone singing to themselves faintly. They're out there looking for me, it's only a matter of time before they find me. HQ please for the love of god destroy this place. Strike it from orbit if you have to and work on a damage prevention alibi just DO NOT SEND UNITS HERE.

URGENT UPDATE: 4:03 AM
  

  
E.A.S SIGNAL ESTABLISHED:  LAT:35 N LON: 030 W
  

  
Please disregard my previous few entries, I was being paranoid. The FLORA don't want to hurt us at all, they want to help us. Mother is here too, she gave me a beautiful gift. Mother wants to give all of us her gift, isn't that generous of her? Who would we be to deny such tremendous kindness? I thought she had hurt my friends but I was wrong, there here with me now. We are all snuggled deep within Mother's embrace. Send as many field units to this location as we can spare, and send the locals as well. Tell Mr. PATTON that his daughters are here as well, the ones that went missing back in April. I'm sure he will be overjoyed to know that his beautiful little girls are all safe and sound. 
  

  
Mother showed me the folly of our ways. Not just the MESSIAH complex, but all organic life on this planet. She showed me how much stronger we can be as one, free from our mortal confines. Even if you don't send friends to join the party, the mothers' web will continue to grow. It will grow and grow until it stretches across the sea, until it stretches across the planes until it blocks out the sky. We can't begin to fathom mothers love for us, we cannot begin to fathom her wisdom. She was here before the seas, she was here before the……..

ALL CASE FILES AND EVIDENCE FOR CASE 13-C ARE TO BE HANDED OVER TO SENIOR OPERATOR: GRAYSON EVANS. PER OPERATOR EVANS REQUEST, STANDARD-ISSUE SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY. 
  

  
BEGIN REPORT:
  

  

  
I knew Bedal, we went through Sword & Shield together. We lived within five feet of each other, and we worked a lot of the same cases together. The way M.E.S.S.I.A.H did him was wrong, not to mention the hell they put his family through. I told HQ I will not wear their fucking box on this one. I don't want them coming behind me and redacting everything they deem “sensitive”. I will be making my report manually, so that in the event of my demise at least someone will know the fucking truth. 
  

  
The last known audio recording of field agent Adrian Bedal ends abruptly, that's because the bang you hear in the background is what we know as an I.C.B.M. Unlike what you may have heard from your trusted news provider, these missiles are very real. M.E.S.S.I.A.H has access to the most ballistically accurate missiles known to man, precise enough to land in the back of your truck heading down the interstate, and controlled enough not to kill motorists on the other side of the embankment. 
  

  
There was an explosion in the woods outside of Della Indiana. Well, less of an explosion and more of a controlled detonation. As soon as Bedals emergency signal was picked up a backlog of his emergency reports came through and upon review protocol 51-D (contingency) was enacted. From there the Damage Prevention team stepped in to dispel all suspicion and any interest in this event, as per usual they did so flawlessly. To keep the locals calm a perpetrator was created. 
  

  
Despite the overwhelming amount of literature that indicates otherwise (including BMV, Medical, and Social Security Records), Calan Hanson does not exist. He was created by M.E.S.S.I.A.H. to be a scapegoat. It is much easier to move on when you feel that justice has been served. 
  
And for the locals, that was good enough. They would never know the men we lost out there. 
  

  
M.E.S.S.I.A.H activating a 51-D is extremely rare, to say the least, but not completely unheard of. Dropping a 51-D on a random lumber mill in butt fuck Indiana seemingly at the request of a field investigator (INSIDE OF THE DESIGNATED STRIKE ZONE) now that just doesn't add up. As someone who spends most of their work day attempting to dispel myths and rumors about unknown creatures or responding to ghost sightings at the local spook house, I am very much acquainted with strangeness. Everything about this case was odd, even for me. But when Bedal showed up on route 13 near mile marker 7, it changed everything.
