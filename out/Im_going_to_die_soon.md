Currently I'm in the hospital, I will probably die very soon, And I do not wish my death to be in vein, what I want is to prove to the world that something higher exists, unfortunately I will have to prove it when my brain is completely dead, they already have a clean mri scan of my brain, the next one will tell a different story... Here Is my story: I was on ayahuasca a couple of times, the first time I had almost complete control and I had almost infinite energy, somehow I was connected with holy lines and I have let ayahuasca and those beings be one with myself, and the entire time I was sober, I was connected in this world with an incredible power, I was thinking 100 things at once, they weren't words, but a thought came to me as if was like a vibration, it all started when I was in bed and these thoughts came to me, I knew then what did I want, and I had full faith in ayahuasca and I relaxed, my body started dancing to invite those lines(or beings) to connect with them in this world, I felt the energy of my mother completely and I was completely present, those thoughts were like vibrations and I did not think in an ordinary way but in a higher way, when one thought comes to you within a millisecond and immediately and you instantly go hm hm hm, and I had a million of them, he showed me many things and I started to open the channels that were blocked to me , my hands moved on their own on my head and I felt that I was connecting everything with my fingers and that I was connecting these holy lines as well, but I didn't succeed in the end, because I didn't do some things correctly and I tried to connect again, but in a forced way. This is my first experience.

The 2 one is not really that important, I bassicaly had a horrible trip, but I did it again the same day because I knew that I severed almoust every connection there is, and I knew the only way to get it back is by taking it again,

My mother threw away most of it, but there was a bit left, so I took it on the day the eclipse was settling

At 2 in the morning I took the ayahuasca and It was going horribly, but I had faith that the world loves me and that it wants me to be repaired, I've let this omnipotent being control over me, I gave him full control over my body and I knew that he was something far greater and he started to work on my body and mind, I started to do the seed mantra chanting on my own I was doing these vibrations And so I vibrated and thought and traveled through my thoughts, while the holy spirit swung me like a baby And the whole time he caressed me in the same way, as if telling me that everything will be fine, but every time I have a thought about him and his powers and his knowledge, it started to disappear, then I give him full control again and I did not question it again, because it has the knowledge of the universe, this lasted for a good 6 hours. Once I went to sleep I felt that something went inside of me, the next day I had this power, to think 100 thoughts, to travel, to look at other people and sense what they're thinking and I could imagine whole universes and worlds and go through them and think at the same time and I had almoust infinite energy,and all in all I was believe that I opened something amazing, and to this day They're still inside of me, and they are taking more and more from me.

This is one of the messages I have sent to my friend, I currently do not possess enough brain power to write such things again, my memories, thoughts, emotions,contemplating and almost everything that makes you human I have had the ability to manipulate and I have severed almoust everything. I have placed a curse on myself that each day that I'm getting worse and worse, I do not know when or what happened anymore, but still I wish to leave proof, I just took too many wrong turns and I have ended up in this situation where almost all thoughts and emotions have faded away, and I'm deleting myself entirely

I'm in the netherlands right now At maxima mc My name Is Mirza Durakovic They have an mri scan of my brain, it's basically clean I will do another one and this time It will show that I no longer have that much of brain activity, I severed almoust everything, It will be undeniable proof, because it',s impossible to go from a clean mri scan to a braindead one with just thoughts right? Or maybe they will probably say that I've hit my head or something. And I will, or my family will show proof of the mri scans, I'm going to try to document everything.

The 2 mri scan is going to take place in early January

With that, I will be proof that something higher exists, and ayahuasca will be looked at in a different way, and further research will be conducted,I want this to be looked at in a good way, I don't want my death to be meaningless, I want to make a change, I want new light to be seen and that indeed there is something higher, I will be proof of it, my brain is going to be proof.

The mri scan will be done at around january, I probably won',t be speaking or doing anything at that point, just walking and going towards that destination of the mri scan.

I will be the proof

What I will show you now is what happens almoust everyday, I'm getting marks on my body, I'm not entirely sure what exactly they are, but It happens each time I lose something, these connections are connected throughout your whole body and brain, I bassically placed a curse on myself that whatever i do wherever I go It is the wrong decision and Each day It's taking something from me..

I was never a true believer of these things, i tried to basically rewrite my brain to it's previous version, And I could not find exactly what I was searching for, now I believe that I have been reduced to something else, I will never be born a human again, human beings are the most powerful creatures in the universe, I still have a little bit of time, but my mind is 5% of what it used to be...

I'm too deep of a rabbit hole, I cannot think anymore, feel emotions, contamplate, or anything anymore.. The netherlands Is a strict country when it comes to privacy, that's why I want to make this public that I give full permision into looking at my file, I'll probably be almoust completely braindead when I go and do the 2 mri scan, So I'll tell my family to post both pictures of the mri scan when its done, I have little to no time anymore, I can barely walk at this point, this is not an ego trip, nor is this is a psychosis break, nor am I manic, I just want everyone to wait and to see the 2 mri scans, I do not wish my death to be meaningless and that I die without giving anything back, just please.. wait for the 2 mri scan.
