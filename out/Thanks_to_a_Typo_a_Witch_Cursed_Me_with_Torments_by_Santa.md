So there I was, minding my own business, making snide comments on social media posts while waiting for more players to join the next game.

>It’s *you’re*, dumbass.  Learn to spell, genius.

It was just another day for a humble internet troll.  You know how it goes, sleep in until my parents and younger sister go to work, then roll off the mattress in the basement to fire up the Xbox and spawn camp some noobs for a few hours.  I made sure to hydrate with the finest dew of the mountains.  It’s important to stay sharp when matching wits with witless twits.  Do you like that?  I came up with it on my own.  Mostly.

After finishing the two liter bottle, I didn’t throw it out just yet.  Pro tip:  the bottle can be reused for dehydrating when the dew works its way through the body.  Normally, I empty these before my parents get home, but sometimes I forget.  Nothing ruins my day like being scolded for urinary efficiency.  They don’t understand there’s no pause button on these games, and I’m not going to leave the lobby before I make those losers cry over how bad they suck.

It was a quiet morning.  I was just going through the motions, switching between my sniper rifle and grenade launcher to send some low level losers to the deep over and over again.  My screen flashed red as someone managed to sneak up behind me and get a short range kill with a shotgun.  In the text chat, I made a comment about going undefeated until this rando got lucky.  That same moron had the nerve to respond.

>maybe if u werent so focused on making others unhappy, u might find time to enjoy things

Oh, hell no.  I was not going to let some jagoff tell me how to play the game, and write it so poorly.  I checked out the username.  It was something stupid like “wicked_wiccan_05”.  I did some digging on the name, using various search techniques, and I found an Instagram account with pictures of a girl.  Look,  I know a catfish when I see one.  This was some guy trying to make me think a girl was talking to me.  I decided to give “her” the business, make him regret trying to embarrass me with a stupid shotgun.  I wrote back in the chat.

>There’s no skill in a shotgun kill, bro.  I was too busy waxing your friends to pay attention to your worthless ass.  Won’t happen again.

I started strafing around the map, looking for “her” to pop up so I could chalk up some more wins.  She wrote back.

>k

I leaned forward on the beanbag chair.  No way.  No fucking way.  Game on.

I looked everywhere, but I couldn’t find the player.  “She” was still in the arena, but I did not see her anywhere.  I checked the common places first where most newbies hide, but I couldn’t find her.  I paused for a moment when I heard a noise outside, but I recognized the mailman’s uniform from the basement windows.  When I looked back at the screen, she had snuck up behind me and killed me again.

Suddenly, it hit me.  She was cheating.  Nothing else made sense.  I called her out on it.

>Turn off the cheats and I won’t report you.  Show me you’ve got skill without breaking the rules.

Her reply really pissed me off.

>k

I smoked a few more losers before she got me again.  Same thing, shotgun from behind.  I had no idea she was there.  My blood was boiling, so I did something rare – left before the match was over.  She sent a direct message to my inbox.

>bye c u next time

I loathe bad spelling.  And bad grammar.  I couldn’t believe the audacity of this bitch.  I sent a scathing retort about her living alone with her cats and never getting married or even finding a jackass jerkface boyfriend.

>id rather be single then end up with you

I went back to the instagram page, looking for something to focus on.  It was just some hippie dippie bullshit about being connected to nature and one with the world mixed with geometry pictures and gifs of her cats.  The few pictures she posted of herself were generic yoga-like poses and filtered sideways selfies.  Finally, near the end, I found a photo with her facing the camera, and I noticed she had a lazy eye.  Jackpot!  It was strange that this guy would catfish with someone who had such an obvious flaw, but whatever.

>No wonder your boyfriend left you.  He thought you were seeing someone on the side.

No reply came.  I won.

For a few hours, I did more of my routine, admiring beautiful artwork online, attending to . . . personal needs in the bathroom, then applying for a few jobs to show my parents I was trying to find work.  Companies don’t want to hire men like me, the guys who aren’t betacuck losers who will take some jagoff boss’s bullshit with a smile.  I refuse to lower my standards or adhere to some leftist loser hygiene policy because some bitch in accounting doesn’t like my natural musk.  Probably a lesbian.

I went to the kitchen to get a snack, and I was a little irritated to have to push past the meal prep containers my goodie-two-shoes sister made for herself.  It was bad enough she was younger and more successful than me, but she also had to go on these health kicks that also helped her save money for buying a house.  It was disgusting.  Kristen was disgusting.  I settled on chips and guacamole.  That’s healthy, right?

Something still bothered me about that earlier encounter.  The catfish cheater hadn’t learned his lesson.  I sent another message to her inbox.

>It must be nice to look both ways before crossing the street without having to move your head.

I got a reply almost immediately.

>stop im warning u

Must have struck a nerve.  Good.

>If my comments offend you, just look the other way.

She wrote back just as quickly.

>last warning, im serious

Whatever, I’ve heard these empty threats before.  I was winning, and I wasn’t going to stop.

>You’re right, I should try to see things from your perspective.  Maybe you’d have made a great schoolteacher if you could learn to control your pupils.

I was on a roll and it felt good, but her next reply was just weird.

>fine have it your way.  i curse you to be tormented by santa

What a moron!

>Learn to spell, dumbass.  It’s Satan that does the tormenting.

I should have anticipated her reply.

That night, I had a dream someone was watching me from the top of the basement stairs.  I think it might have been my parents checking on me, which they sometimes do (although it must have been very late or very early for them).  I woke uneasily, but then I saw my open laptop facing me, and the camera shutter was slid open.  Maybe that was it.  I closed the shutter and opened an incognito tab to find some revenge porn.

I’m not sure how to describe what happened next.  I heard a word, but it was not spoken aloud.  It was more like when a speaker is playing from another room, and the sound drifts through the wall.  Muffled, but discernible. 

[Stop.]

I chalked it up to my spidey sense, that maybe my mom was still home.  I made my way upstairs and ate some peanut butter out of the jar.  Checking the house while licking my fingers clean, there were no signs of anyone else.  Not my parents, not Kristen.  I lingered by her room and found myself staring at her dresser.  Then I heard the voice again.

[No.]

Whatever, I wasn’t going to open it.  The good stuff was already in the hamper, but mom and dad read me the riot act the last time I got caught.  Not worth it.

I went back to the game, but it just wasn’t scratching the itch.  I hadn’t gotten any messages from that wicca weirdo, and I found myself going through the motions on middling murders.  I switched to my laptop and decided to admire some online art of . . . lovely young girls that may or may not include tentacles.

[Wow.  Really?]

“Who said that?” I asked.  “How can you see me?”

[You don’t remember the song?  *I see you when you’re sleeping, I know when you’re awake, I know if you’ve been bad or good.*  In case you were confused, James, you’ve been very, very bad.]

“Bullshit.  I’m hallucinating.  Someone contaminated my dew.  What’s next, you’re going to tell me I’ll be visited by three ghosts?”  I entered a search in the browser despite the disembodied conversation.

[No, just me.]

“Whatever.  Enjoy the most tentacley pics I can find of these sexy, sexy lolis.”

[Seriously?  Do you really not understand how unnerving that is?  Please stop.]

“Oh, you don’t like it?” I asked.  “No problem.”  I switched to a traditional tube site instead, and entered “Santa Claus” into the search bar.

[What the fuck is wrong with you?]

I hovered over the thumbnails for a bit until I found one featuring a cross-dressed femboy servicing a beefy Santa.  Without waiting for it to buffer, I downloaded it.  Then I started playing the video.

[Please don’t make me watch this.  Wouldn’t you rather be good, wouldn't you rather get a present?]

“I’m gonna present my hog in a minute and make you watch that.”  Actually, it wasn’t a bad idea, the video was kind of hot.  If I squinted my eyes, I could pretend the femboy was a girl and I was Santa.  I found myself getting aroused.

[You’re awful.  Truly awful.  This isn’t working.  I’m supposed to be tormenting you.]

I slid off my shorts and briefs and started stroking.  “You like that, Santa?”

[**No!  No!  Please stop!**]

“Oh, I get it.  You’d rather me be the femboy taking care of your candy cane?  That’s gross, you sick old fuck.”

[Oh, God.  Please make it stop.  How do I make it stop?]

“That’s right, Santa-San. I’ll clean your pipes under the mistletoe.”  Surprisingly, I was still aroused, so I continued my manual machinations.

[What if I gave you a present anyway?  Please?  Tell me what you want.]

“I want your eggnog dripping down my chin, unless you’d rather come down my chimney.”  Wow, this was hot.  I never thought I’d be into this kind of thing.  I’m not gay or anything.

[Ugh, please, no more.  I’d vomit if I could – wait, are you about to –]

Before he could finish, I exploded.  It was amazing, one of the best orgasms I’ve ever had.  Even better, I heard his muffled crying.  I really got him.

I cleaned up and walked upstairs to get a snack.  I picked celery sticks, no dip.  That afternoon, I took a shower and shaved for the first time in months.  I shaved more than my beard, since that’s what Santa-San likes.  Don’t judge me, I’m just getting under his skin (if he has any).

It’s been a few weeks since this started, and I’ve lost a few pounds by making healthier choices.  I even have a couple of job interviews lined up.  I’ll need the money to afford some sexy skirts, and toys for Santa.  Ain’t that rich, I’m buying toys for Santa!  Well, they’ll be used on me, but I want to make sure he gets an eyeful (so to speak).  Nothing like a captive audience to enjoy the show.  Hopefully he likes my take on Christmas stockings.

He hasn’t spoken in a while, but I do hear him weeping gently sometimes.  I should thank that witch.  What did Santa do to her that earned him being [tormented by me](http://www.reddit.com/r/dull_sad_quiddities/)?
