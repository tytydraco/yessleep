It started around the time I was fourteen. Back then I believed it was my mother checking up on me at night. She had always been an anxious person, worried about everything and nothing so I didn't think too much of it. Usually, I would be too sleepy to even notice much. I would just hear the sound of soft footsteps or the creaking of the door. It never lasted long and most of the time I would be back asleep moments later.

It happened semi-regularly for years, without startling me too much. I didn't scared easily as a child and even at that young age I usually found logical reasoning for many things. That is until I was about seventeen and the visitor came back.

I was lying in bed with my bedroom door closed but not locked. This time it wasn't the sound that woke me but the soft breeze that made me shiver. As I was just about to pull my blanket over my head, I heard the steps of someone walking over to my desk, rustling through the papers on top of it. Drawings I had made that day.

I held my breath and made sure to stay frozen. My parents weren't home.

It was the first night they'd ever left me completely alone. It had been a long discussion between my parents before they left the house. Even though I was clearly old enough, my mother didn't like leaving me.

Her anxiety was never about herself, she was brave when it came to anything but me.

I prayed that this person would leave if I stayed still enough. Or maybe my parents came home after all.

I didn't dare to check. But I also couldn't hold my breath forever so I tried as hard as I could to keep it quiet and calm.

After what could have been a few minutes or an hour, I felt that the presence was gone. Whoever or whatever it was.

But I still didn't get up, I didn't check until the sun finally was up and my courage returned.

The house was silent and my parents' bedroom was empty.

--

Later in the day, my parents came back home.

I knew I couldn't tell my mother because this would only give her more reasons for her fear and paranoia. Even if it finally was justified.

So I only told my father and made him swear not to tell Mum.

He understood and started secretly checking each door and window for any signs of intruders. He couldn't find anything and nothing was taken from our home.

"Are you absolutely sure you didn't dream it all, Maeve?" He asked carefully.

I shook my head.

I wasn't sure about anything anymore.

The thing I hadn't told him was that the paint on my drawings was slightly smudged.

--

The nightly visitor stayed a part of my life for the following five years. I can't say for sure how often it happened, or how many times I had been asleep during the visits. All I know is that it stayed a constant in my life. Only when I moved away to college, did it stop.

But every time I was back home, I felt it again. I started putting up a camera to film my room all night but there was never any footage of another human walking around.

It simply wasn't possible and I started wondering if it might be all in my mind after all. Something I was too afraid to open up about to anyone.

A few months ago, I graduated from college with a degree in graphic design and moved back with my parents. They didn't question at first why I didn't want to live completely on my own, why I decided to get a job at the local newspaper in our boring small town. I only told them that I wanted to do some simple work for a year, to get some experience before I started looking for something real. And that was fine with them. Especially with my Mum who was always happier to have me close by.

As the months went by I became more and more comfortable. My friends in school had all moved away but I found new ones.

One of them was Jess who worked at the same newspaper as a writer. She had been a year above me in high school, we didn't have much contact back then but now connected over being one of the few young people still around.She introduced me to Cory who lived on her street. Cory was in my year at school but we weren't in the same circles back then.

I started spending most of my time with them and stopped researching jobs out of town.

I found a steady routine until the incident happened that would shake our entire town to its core.

I was just coming back from the cinema one evening with Jess when Cory called us to tell us some horrifying news. Something terrible had happened in the quiet of our small town last night. The body of a young man had been found in front of the grocery store. And the most gruesome part was that his heart had been ripped out. Cory also told us that something similar had happened 30 years ago in this same town. Back then three people had died, and all their hearts had been ripped out.

--

The town instated a nightly lockdown right away.

"I loved having you around here, with us. But it's time for you to leave, sweetheart."

"It's time for all of us to leave! Jeez, there is a murderer in this town. In movies all the dumb people always stay around, thinking it won't happen to them. Let's just get the hell out of here. Take a vacation or-,"

My mother simply shook her head.

"Cory said this happened 30 years ago. That's when you were around my age, Mum. So you knew about it and never even told me? He said it didn't stop with one person, we should get away!" I shouted.

"I don't like your new friends, they are bad company," she changed the subject.

"Mum!" I demanded.

My mother gave me a sad smile. Before I could say anything else, my father appeared behind us and put a hand on my shoulder. I felt it tremble and he seemed out of breath, as if he had run home.

"Maeve, go up to your room," my mother said in a dry tone.

"Just because I live here, you can't treat me like a child. Tell me what's going on!"

"Maeve," my father added in a strict tone that I hadn't heard from him in a long time. "Go to your room."

--

My parents wouldn't talk to me about the topic for the rest of the evening but gave me a set of rules if I wanted to stay with them.

Don't go outside after curfew. Keep your window locked at all times. Always tell us exactly where you're going but try to stay inside as much as possible.

All of that was easy enough as I didn't plan to get myself in danger and I countered by giving them the same rules.

We all agreed and had a quiet dinner.

At the end, as I got ready to bring my plate to the kitchen, I only asked one more question.

"Was the body identified?"

My father nodded.

"Rick Matthews."

--

Rick Matthews. I knew Rick. We weren't friends or anything but we used to go to school together. He'd moved away after school so he must have been in town visiting his parents or something. It made me feel sick to think about it. He was my age and someone decided to take his young life in such a gruesome way.

I also vaguely remembered that he was friends with Cory. I wasn't sure if they'd stayed in touch but they used to sit together during lunch.

I decided to give Cory a call but he didn't pick up so I tried Jess instead. But she wouldn't pick up either.

That night I spent hours just staring at the ceiling, going through everything that had happened that day.

My eyes were still open when the door to my room opened. I shifted my gaze over, my eyes were already adjusted to the dark but I didn't see anyone.

My body froze when I heard the footsteps. They came closer and stopped right next to my bed. And then I could swear I felt a damp hand on my cheek.

This time, I screamed.

My mother immediately appeared at my door, with my dad right behind her.

She turned on the light and basically jumped towards me, wrapping herself around me. Her breathing was just as fast as mine.

"What happened?"

My entire body was trembling, I couldn't get a word out.

My Dad ran to the window which was locked. He kept looking outside and then checked every corner of my room.

"I think it was just a nightmare," my mother whispered but her heartbeat didn't slow down. "Why don't you make her some tea or hot milk?"

My father let out a deep sigh and left the room.

Only then did my mother loosen her grip on me. She cupped my cheeks with her hand and kissed my forehead.

"It's all okay. Everything is fine," she whispered but as she pulled her hands away I noticed the blood on one of them.

She wordlessly grabbed a t-shirt I had lying on the ground to clean my check and then her hand.

"What is going on?" I whispered with a trembling voice.

"You're protected. That's all that matters."

--

I was too shocked to ask any more questions. For years the visitor had come to me at night but this was the first time I had a real sign of them being there. And with the murder happening, it was all too much for my mind.

And I couldn't get around the feeling that my mother was hiding something. My mother who was always afraid, always on edge didn't say a word about the blood on my cheek.

But she'd stayed with me all night, lying next to me and gently stroking my hair until I fell back asleep.

I didn't get a chance to confront her about it the next morning before the horrible news reached us.

Another young person had been found with a missing heart.

The news of where they had been found or when didn't even reach my brain. All I heard was the name before my vision blurred.

*Jess*.

"I'm so sorry, honey. I know you got very close over the past months," my father quietly spoke but his voice sounded far away.

This wasn't possible.

Jess was dead.

Jess had been murdered.

--

I didn't leave my bed for the rest of the day. Or the next. If the visitor came again that night, I didn't notice.

At least there wasn't any more news of a murder the next day.

I had planned to spend another day in bed when there was suddenly a knock on my door.

"Hey," I heard Cory say. He had heavy bags under his eyes and his voice was hoarse.

"Hey," I said back and we watched each other for a long moment. We hadn't spoken since the news about Jess. Tears started forming in my eyes and he came over to hug me. We both sat there for a moment, silent. There were no words that could make any of this better.

"So," he said after a while. "You don't have to come along for this. Jess' funeral," he closed his eyes for a moment, "is in a few days but I wanted to do something before that for her. Something personal."

I wiped away my tears and sat up straighter.

"There's this spot by the lake where we would go and have campfires. I thought we could go there, say a few words.. I don't know. It won't be dark because we have to leave before lockdown but-"

"Let's do it." It was a completely dumb idea but I was grieving and sick of feeling helpless.

Mum wasn't home but I swore to my dad that I would be back before lockdown. He was reluctant but I promised to share my location the entire time and he finally gave in.

So Cory and I got in his car and headed for the lake. We made a quick stop at a gas station where I went in to get some drinks while Cory filled up the car.

I didn't have the best sense of direction but the way we were going didn't feel familiar. I felt a knot forming in my stomach when Cory drove a narrow road into the forest and stopped the car next to some big trees.

"The regular road is blocked, we need to park here and walk the rest," he answered calmly.

"What? Cory, there's a murderer on the loose, I'm not going through some creepy forest."

He lowered his brows.

"It's not dark yet. I'm sure there are people still walking around with their dogs and stuff."

"*Here*? In the middle of nowhere?"

I tried to grab my phone but couldn't find it in my bag.

Cory looked at me and smiled.

"Don't worry, Maeve. It ends after three and then we don't need to do anything for another 30 years."

I had made a massive mistake.

"Cory, where is my phone?"

"Ditched it at the gas station. You shouldn't have left it in your bag, there's a murderer on the loose after all."

I looked around for anything that could work as a weapon. Maybe a drink bottle but they were on the backseat. My best chance was to try and make a run for it. But he'd locked the doors before I could.

"Don't worry, I'll open them in just a moment. I just want you to understand that I'm not a monster, Maeve."

"I don't think you're a monster," I lied, trying to distract him long enough to form a plan. "I don't understand this. You couldn't have done this 30 years ago."

He grinned.

"Well that's cause it wasn't me then. This is a family tradition."

I never understood why Cory had never left town. His family was insanely well off and he was smart as hell. He could have gone to one of the best schools in the country.

"It happened 30 years before that as well but people like to forget things in the past."

He gave me a wolfish grin.

"Why? Why any of this?"

"Because the hearts feed our lands. Give us prosperity and all that other good stuff. Alright, Maeve. Are you ready? Cause I don't want to make my car dirty."

With that, he unlocked the door and without hesitating, I opened my door and ran. I realized too late that I should have run to the street and not into the forest.

I heard the woods crack behind me, he wasn't far away but he kept more distance than he had to. He was playing with me.

I could try to surprise him, tackle him. But he definitely had a weapon.

Before I could think of a plan, I stumbled on something and fell to the ground, hitting my knee hard on a stone.

I tried to get up but couldn't.

Then I saw what I had fallen over. A candle. Next to a tree with a name carved in.

Maeve.

My name was carved into the tree. How was that possible? He couldn't have known that I would end up here.

Cory's steps sounded closer now but I didn't dare look back.

He laughed loudly.

"That is just fantastic! You came right to the dying spot!"

I slowly turned around and looked into Cory's manic face and saw the dagger in his hand.

He stopped right in front of me and lifted the dagger above his head. I closed my eyes, saying a silent prayer. And that's when I heard the dagger slam into flesh.

But not into mine. I opened my eyes just in time to see Cory's body thud to the ground, the end of the dagger pointing out of his own chest.

I don't know how long I crouched on that forest ground, entirely frozen. Nothing made sense. Nothing.

I only came back to my senses when I heard someone running towards me in the distance. I grabbed for the dagger that was still in Cory's chest but halted when I saw who was running toward me.

"Mum?"

She let out a scream. Of relief, I realized.

She fell to the ground in front of me and grabbed me tight.

Then she beheld Cory's body.

"What happened?"

So I told her everything.

Then her eyes drifted to the tree that had my name on it.

"She protected you," She said quietly.

"*She*?"

Tears started forming at the corners of her eyes.

"We immediately called the police after your location was disconnected. But then I had a feeling I had to come here, I think she was leading me here."

"Who?" I whispered.

"My sister."

--

Shortly after we heard police sirens. I didn't get a chance to ask my mother any questions because we had to deal with everything else first.

And there would be a lot more to deal with. A police investigation and a very powerful and rich family of murderers.

But when we were finally alone, my mother gave me the answers I had been looking for.

"I never told you about your aunt. She died before you were even born. She was my entire life and losing her ripped apart my entire soul. But even when she was gone, I could tell a part of her was still there. She used to come to me. I somehow could always sense that it was her but of course, I couldn't tell anyone about it. She didn't speak, she was just there, watching me."

My chest tightened.

"But one day she disappeared. It was when I was pregnant with you, a few weeks before you were born. She was there one last time. It felt final."

"Why did you never tell me about this?"

"I thought she left that day, that her energy was spent up. And I didn't want to scare you. I only realized that she was still here on the night that I saw the blood on your face. She wasn't watching me anymore but she was protecting the most important thing to me."

She gave me a sad smile.

It sounded impossible but I had felt that presence, she had touched my cheek. And she had stabbed Cory. I hated saying these next words but I had to ask.

"Why do you think she didn't stop the other murders from happening?"

"I don't know. Maybe she couldn't. I believe she tried, that's why she had that blood on her hands that night. Maybe seeing you in danger took her over the edge."

"Is this why you never left town?"

Tears were rolling down her face.

"I couldn't leave her alone."

I hugged my mother.

That was what Cory meant by dying spot. The name on the tree wasn't for me. It was for the woman I was named after.

All these years I was afraid of the stranger watching me at night.

But as it turns out she was looking out for me this [entire time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid)
