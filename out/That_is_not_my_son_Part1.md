I apologize for the formatting, I am writing this on my phone as my laptop has been broken.

My life has been perfect up to the details. I've made sure that everything has gone perfectly. My parents always say that there's a "curse" that makes me so lucky but I always laugh it off. 

I married the perfect man, has the perfect son, and I am in a perfect line of work. I believe that my life is not lucky, I am just grateful for all that I have. I believed that until exactly two months ago to the date...

I had a normal day at work, and I came home to find my son watching television in the living room next to my husband. They were so invested in their show that they barely noticed me coming home to them. I sat down next to them and said my hello's before walking upstairs to wash my face off in the bathroom. I walked into the bathroom and looked in the mirror before turning on the light when I saw something behind me..

It quickly disappeared the moment I noticed it, and I turned on the light. I blamed it on stress because who would be in my house? How would they get in? Why would they be here? I ignored all the burning questions in my head and continued on with my facial routine and headed downstairs to start on dinner. 

I made a simple meal and sat down to eat when I looked at my son, and behind him was a strange darkness that could only be described as a demon, although I didn't see it after I blinked, I had a feeling that it wasn't the stress and I really was seeing things.

I finished dinner and tucked my son into bed as I read a story to him, as he loved reading with me and his dad.

He drifted off the sleep and I turned off his light and began cleaning the small mess in the corner of his room. I found a paper that he drew of his family and my heart warmed up when I saw me and my husband with him in the drawing. I looked to the sides of the drawing and saw the same dark figure looking at my son from the distance.

I needed to go to sleep to clear my head, so I went to bed and quickly fell asleep. Suddenly in the middle of the night, I heard a loud noise and decided to investigate. I looked into my son's room and he was gone..

I panicked, I rushed around the house to find him. Maybe he was just getting a drink? Or going to the bathroom? Those were my first thought but he was not there either
1 finally found him staring out of the window and I was relieved so I turned him around only to find large black eyes replacing his regular green ones. I knew that this was not my sonâ€¦..
