It took me some time to work up the nerve to contact management.

That sounds ridiculous written out like that, but after what I’d seen on the board, making it official felt like stepping into something I couldn’t step back out of. If I told them my name was missing, I couldn’t pretend it was just stress. If they confirmed it, I couldn’t pretend it was a mistake.

I kept rehearsing the conversation in my head.

Simple. Calm. Practical.

Hi, I think there’s an error on the tenant sheet in the lobby. My unit is listed as occupied but my name isn’t there.

That was all it was supposed to be.

I decided to call, rather than go directly to the office. It seemed easier to manage the situation that way.

I waited until midday. I told myself that meant I was thinking clearly. That I wasn’t calling at some panicked hour with dark circles under my eyes and my voice shaking.

When I finally dialed the number, my hand was sweating.

A woman answered on the third ring.

Her voice was bright. Professional. Like she was smiling while she spoke.

“Building management, how can I help?”

I gave her my name. I gave her my unit number.

There was a pause. Not long. Just the kind of pause you get when someone is pulling up a file.

Then she said, “Can you repeat the unit number for me?”

I did.

More typing. I could hear it faintly through the phone.

Then, still in the same pleasant tone, “And you said your name is…?”

I repeated it.

Another pause.

“I’m not seeing that name associated with that unit.”

For a second I couldn’t breathe properly.

I forced out a laugh that didn’t sound like me. “Right. That’s the problem. My name isn’t on the sheet downstairs either. It says the unit is occupied, but I’m not listed as the tenant.”

She hummed softly, like she was thinking.

“Unit is showing as occupied, yes.”

“By who?” I asked. I tried to keep my voice steady. “Because I’m here. I’m in the apartment right now.”

“I understand,” she said, and there was something in that phrase that made my stomach drop. Not concern or doubt, but familiarity.

“I’m just not seeing your name on the lease record.”

“That doesn’t make sense,” I said. “I’ve lived here for years.”

Another pause, longer this time.

“We have an active occupancy on that unit,” she said. “Payments are current. No issues flagged. There hasn’t been any vacancy notice.”

The words felt slippery. Like they were all true, but not in the way they should have been.

“Okay,” I said. “So you agree the unit is occupied.”

“Yes.”

“And you agree someone is paying for it.”

“Yes.”

“And you’re telling me… you don’t have a tenant name?”

“I’m telling you I don’t have your name,” she corrected gently.

I stared at my living room wall while she spoke. The couch. The folded blanket. Everything in its place. The kind of normal that had started to feel like a threat.

“Would it be easier if I came down to the office?” I asked.

“Yes,” she said. “If you want to stop by with identification, we can take a look in person.”

The way she said it, you would think she’d just suggested we review a parking permit.

I hung up and sat there for a while with the phone in my hand, trying to decide if going downstairs was a mistake.

In the end I went anyway, because I couldn’t think of anything else. If there was a rational explanation, this was my best chance of finding it.

The management office is on the ground floor, tucked behind a door with frosted glass. I’ve walked past it countless times. I’ve never had a reason to go in.

The hallway outside it smelled faintly of disinfectant. The kind of clean smell that makes everything feel less human.

I knocked.

The same woman opened the door. Mid-thirties maybe. Hair tied back. Plain cardigan. A lanyard with a name badge. 

She smiled like we were meeting for the first time.

“Hi,” she said. “How can I help you?”

For a moment I just stood there.

I had spoken to her less than twenty minutes ago. I could still hear her voice in my ear.

“I called earlier,” I said. “About the tenant sheet.”

Her smile didn’t change. “Okay.”

“My name isn’t on it.”

“Right,” she said, and turned back toward her desk. “Come in.”

The office was small. Two chairs for visitors. A desk. A printer. A filing cabinet. A corkboard with keys hanging on hooks. Everything labelled. Everything organised.

She sat down and pulled up her system again.

“Unit number?” she asked.

I gave it.

“And your name?”

I gave it again. Slower this time.

Her fingers moved on the keyboard. She nodded along as if she was following something.

Then she frowned slightly.

“I’m not seeing that.”

“Seeing what?” I asked.

“Your name,” she said.

I pulled my wallet out and slid my ID across the desk.

She barely glanced at the photo. Her eyes went straight to the text. She typed again.

“Okay,” she said eventually, as if nothing about this was strange. “So you’re saying you currently live in that unit.”

“I’m not saying it,” I snapped. The edge in my voice surprised even me. “I do. I’m there. My stuff is there.”

She looked up at me for the first time with something like mild concern.

“I understand you believe that,” she said.

My skin went cold.

“Believe it?” I repeated.

She held her hands up slightly, palms down, a calming gesture.

“I’m not accusing you of anything,” she said quickly. “I’m just explaining what I can see in our records.”

I forced myself to breathe through my nose. In and out. Slow.

“Show me,” I said.

She turned the monitor slightly so I could see.

The screen showed my apartment number.

Status: OCCUPIED.

Account: ACTIVE.

There was a line where a name should have been.

It was blank.

Not unknown.

Not pending.

Just… blank.

“So who lives there?” I asked, quieter now.

She shook her head. “It doesn’t list a name.”

“That can’t be right.”

She shrugged, small and helpless. “It happens sometimes with older records.”

“It happens sometimes,” I repeated, because that was the most insane part. The casualness. The idea that a person could disappear from a system and it could be filed under sometimes.

“Can you add it?” I asked. “Can you just… put it in?”

She typed again. Clicked. Tried a few fields. It looked like she was doing something.

Then she stopped.

“I’m not able to edit that field,” she said. “It’s greyed out.”

I leaned forward.

“You can’t edit it.”

“I can make a note,” she offered.

“A note where?”

“In the account,” she said.

“Do it,” I said, too fast.

She clicked. Typed.

She read aloud as she wrote, like she was humouring me.

“Tenant states they reside in Unit—”

“Not states,” I said. “I reside.”

She paused, then continued without arguing, just adjusting the wording like this was about tone.

“Tenant resides in Unit—”

She stopped. Clicked save.

“Okay,” she said. “That’s on the account now.”

I watched her for a second, waiting for something to happen. For the name field to populate. For the system to correct itself. For her face to change.

Nothing did.

She looked at me like we were done.

“I can also ask our supervisor to review it,” she offered. “Sometimes the system takes time to update.”

“How long?” I asked.

“A couple days,” she said. “Maybe a week.”

I felt dizzy in a slow, creeping way.

A couple days. Maybe a week.

Like my name was a parcel delayed in the post.

“Is there… a key registered?” I asked suddenly. My mouth was moving before my brain caught up. “To my unit.”

She turned to the key board without hesitation. Scanned labels.

Then she plucked a key ring off a hook and held it up.

My apartment number was written on the tag.

I stared at it until my vision blurred.

“So you do have keys,” I said.

“Yes,” she said, still calm. “Management keeps spares.”

“I never gave you a copy,” I heard myself say.

“Yes, you did,” she replied, and then paused, as if she was realising I might argue. “Or the previous tenant did. We always have spares.”

My throat tightened.

Because that was exactly the problem.

In her mind, there was always a version of events where this made sense. It didn’t matter which one. The system could always explain itself.

Standing there, I realised something.

If I disappeared tomorrow, nothing about that screen would need to change.

The unit would still be occupied.  
The records would still balance.

That was the moment I understood that as far as the system was concerned, I was already replaceable.
