I've been helping my parents pack for their move to their new house south of here. Mom's arthritis is getting worse, and they want somewhere warmer. While clearing out my old bedroom closet, I found a composition notebook decorated with Christmas stickers and what I'm pretty sure is crushed candy cane. The cover was sticky with that decades-old residue, glittery stickers peeling at the corners—exactly the kind of thing I would've done as a kid.

The first page is dated December 2008, scrawled in my childish handwriting. Looking at those big, uneven letters brings back memories I thought I'd forgotten, the sight like a slap of nostalgia. I could practically feel the scratchy tip of the marker I'd used:

***Hi!!!! I know Santa is real because he's living in our basement!!!!!***

I almost laughed when I read that. I had such an active imagination as a kid. But as I kept reading, my hands started shaking, the smile melting off my face, replaced by a hollow pit in my stomach.

***I found him when I was looking for my old toys in the basement. He was sitting behind the Christmas boxes and he had a red coat just like the real Santa! His beard was kind of dirty and he smelled weird—like old milk or something—but that's probably because he was tired from delivering presents. He told me not to tell anyone he was here because it's supposed to be a secret. He said he picked our house special.***

I remember this now. I remember how proud I felt that "Santa" had chosen our house. How special I thought I was. The memory sat like a sour lump in my throat as I read on.

***I've been bringing him cookies and milk like you're supposed to do. He eats them super fast and sometimes he asks for other stuff too. I gave him my sandwich yesterday and he ate it in two bites! But now mom is mad because food keeps disappearing from the kitchen. I told her it was for Santa but she just sent me to my room.***

***Dad got really angry today because someone took mom's wallet. I wanted to tell them it was probably Santa getting money to buy presents but I promised I wouldn't tell. Santa said if I tell anyone about him being here, something really bad will happen. He doesn't say ho ho ho like in the movies. His voice is all quiet and scratchy instead, like the sound of leaves crunching under your feet.***

My hands are trembling so badly I can barely hold the pages steady. I remember Mom's missing wallet. I remember Dad installing extra locks on all our doors. I remember them fighting about calling the police.

The next entry made my blood run cold.

***I heard him walking around last night. The stairs made creaky noises when he went up and down, like when Dad goes down to get tools. He stopped outside my door and breathed really loud. I could hear him through the crack under the door. It was slow and heavy, like the sound the fridge makes when it's running. I think he was checking if I was asleep! Good thing mom always makes me lock my door at night or Santa would know I was awake!***

Mom. Oh god, Mom. She always insisted I lock my bedroom door at night. She never told me why. I just thought it was one of her weird rules.

The final entry is dated December 23^(rd).

***Santa is gone today! All his stuff behind the boxes disappeared too. He must have gone to visit other houses! Mom keeps crying and hugging me, saying we're so lucky. I don't know why she's upset - Santa chose our house special! That means I must have been really good this year!***

***There's lots of police cars at the Johnson's house next door. Mom won't let me look out the window, but I bet Santa is visiting them now too! I saw the police finding pieces of his red coat in their trash can. Santa must have gotten a new coat - the old one was pretty dirty anyway.***

***I can't wait for Christmas!!!!!***

***P.S. We're going to stay at Grandma's house for a while. I hope Santa knows where to find me there!***

I had to stop reading. I just called Mom. She broke down crying when I asked her about that Christmas. Through her sobs, she told me the truth about the Johnsons. About what the police found. About why we never came back to that house until New Year's Day.

I'm sitting in my old bedroom right now, and the house creaks and groans like it always did, but tonight, the sounds feel different. More deliberate. I swear I can hear footsteps in the basement. Dad says it's just the old heating system acting up.

But I found something else while packing today. In the basement, behind the stacks of boxes, there was a dirty piece of red fabric snagged on a nail. The smell hit me before I could even touch it—a rancid mix of sweat and decay.

UPDATE: Mom finally told me everything. Apparently, after they found what happened to the Johnsons, the police discovered similar cases in three other states - all in December, all in houses with children, all involving someone who had been living in their basements for days before the murders. They never caught him.

I'm helping my parents move next week. But first, I'm burning those Christmas boxes in the basement. All of them.
