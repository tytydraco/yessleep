It hung over the lake like a black sun against a white expanse, its twin reflected on the water’s surface connected by a solitary chain. The black worms wriggled and writhed across its surface like flames, and on its edges like a halo. The snow tiptoed from the heavens, wary not to disturb the alien sphere. Worshippers lined the edges of the lake, outstretched arms drawn by the gravity of our divine messenger. We watched from the kitchen window as the program director preached fervently to the shivering disciples. The squirming arms of the mass reached out to him, following as he paced.

The two of us outstretched our hands into the rising steam from the boiling pot of rice. When you’re cold all day everyday, that steam is by far the most pleasurable sensation imaginable.

“Do you think it’s from soluble rock, or a crater?” Natalie asked beside me.

“Huh?” I replied, her words pulling my mind from the steam.

She continued, “The lake. I remember seeing in a YouTube video lakes are formed when water dissolves soluble minerals in the ground, making a hole. But, a few are impact craters, and I think that’s a lot cooler.”

“You think the lake might be a crater?”

“It could be. The shores are pretty steep, it kind of looks like it. Wouldn’t that be cool?”

I imagined a flaming rock smashing into the camp, ending this all. “Yeah, that would be cool.” I continued, “Speaking of death from the heavens, I was reading about Sodom and Gomorrah last night.”

She cut me off. “You have a Bible still?” She chuckled, “and what kind of Segway was that?”

“I mean I was reading my notebook from when I was studying the passage with Sodom and Gomorrah.”

She smiled, looking down into the rice. “Got ya. That’s a scary one. Everybody died.”

“It’s got me thinking, Natalie. I’m… Well. I’m afraid we’re all going to die here.”

She frowned and looked back to me in surprise. “What?” She put her hand on my shoulder. “Where’d you get that idea from?”

“Well, in the summer, Caleb and Lydia drowned in the lake. In the fall, Mary got crucified and died and - .”

She cut me off again. “She’s not dead though, she’s still up there bleeding. It’s a miracle.”

I turned and just looked at her, hoping she'd understand how terrifying her words were. She clearly did not. I considered attempting to open her eyes again, but instead replied, “Never mind, I think the cold is just stressing me out.” I gave her a fake smile.

She squeezed my shoulder assuring. “It’s ok, I had some doubts too.” The word doubt excited me, but she continued, “but then in my prayers I just ask that angel out there for comfort, and I always feel better.”

I tried to put some sincerity in my voice. “Yeah, I’ll try that.”

“Could you get another bag of rice for me? This batch is almost ready.”

I nodded my head. “Of course.”

After bringing Natalie the next to last bag of rice, I carefully prepared a meal of boiled beans, rice, a pad of butter, and hot sauce. I took that bowl to Jessica in the foyer.

“I brought you breakfast. He’s letting you out today right?” I asked handing her the bowl. She clutched it in her free hand, the other still handcuffed to the banister. She held it close so the steam warmed her face.

“Yeah, at curfew tonight. Could you actually hold the bowl for me?” 

I sat crisscross on the floor across from her and placed my hand under the bowl. 

After listening to her chew I asked, “If uh, if I was going to leave tonight would you want to come with me?”

She was shoveling bites in before she’d finished the last, but took a short break to reply. “Do you mean, like, run away?”

“… Yeah… Yeah I think bad things are coming.”

She smirked, and spoke through another mouth full, “Bad things are coming huh? How’d you figure that Sherlock?”

“I mean, like, worse. We’re running out of food. The snow is only going to get worse. They can’t keep this up much longer. Something’s going to happen.”

She nodded. “Do you have a plan? We’re hours from everything, and the roads are snowed out.”

“Maybe we could steal a van. We could take the spark plugs out of the other ones so they can’t follow. There’s probably snow chains in them somewhere. We could drive slow.”

She chewed and pondered. “They’d see us. They’d see us steal the keys, and they’d see us get in the vans.”

“We have to try something.”

She put her spoon in the already empty bowl. “If they’re willing to handcuff me to a rail for being late to curfew, I can’t imagine what they’d do if they caught us trying to run away.”

I looked to my lap and rested my head in my hand.

She continued, “We’ll figure something out.”

I stood up. “I read about Sodom and Gomorrah last night.”

She scrunched her brows. “What? Sodom and Gomorrah?”

“I read that last night. So, I think tonight’s the night. Stuff happened the next day the last two times I read.  I’m leaving tonight.”

She looked down. “So you predicted two other things over like 6 months? Big whoop. That doesn’t mean hellfire and brimstone are coming tonight. It’s too dangerous to sneak away. We should just wait until the year is up.”

“I’m leaving tonight.”

“Without me?”

“If you don’t come.” She looked hurt.

“Fine, fuck off then. I’ll see you tomorrow when you fuck it up and get caught.”

“Ok.”
