I will never forget the first time it happened. It’s the reason why I don’t feel safe sleeping at night anymore.

Let me start at the beginning.

It was your normal Monday evening. I was staying up later than usual due to the school holidays, a luxury I rarely get to enjoy anymore.

It was 2:00am when I finally decided to turn in for the night. I would’ve stayed up later if it weren't for the fact that I was going shopping the next day, well technically in a couple of hours.

I turned off the lights and nestled into bed. That's when I heard it.

A soft *tapping* sound against my window.

Heart pounding, I immediately opened the blinds, but there was nothing. It was probably some kind of bug hitting the window. I pulled the blankets over me and went to sleep without a second thought.

I woke up to the sun filtering through the blinds. I groaned.

I opened the blinds; a chill went down my spine.

There were smudges of *fingerprints* on the glass.

And on the ground was a candy wrapper.

My mind started racing. "Was there actually someone outside my window at 2am in the morning?"

I went outside to investigate. The wind had blown the wrapper away, but I couldn’t find anything else suspicious, thankfully.

I picked up the wrapper to have a closer look. It was a Cherry *Ripe* wrapper and there was still some chocolate sticking to it. I pocketed it and I went to investigate the window.

The fingerprints were slightly brown (probably from the chocolate) and there was a dark smear close to the top of the window.

There was nothing else.

I decided to check to see if I accidently left the side gate open yesterday.

Nope. It was still locked.

Someone must’ve jumped the fence last night. But, why?

I tried not to jump to any conclusions about the possibility of someone being there last night. I thought that maybe the smudges were actually dirt and that the wind had blown the *Cherry Ripe* wrapper from next door. But I think I was just trying to make myself feel a little less uneasy, even so, I still felt pretty creeped out for the rest of the day.

I was exhausted by the time I got to bed that day. I didn’t really have the energy to stay up this time, so I went to sleep almost immediately.

I jolted up.

*Something* was tapping against the window again.

A chill went down my spine, and I threw the blinds open once again.

Nothing. There was *nothing*.

I didn’t get much sleep for the rest of the night. Not when my mind was swimming with possibilities.

In the morning, I didn’t hesitate to open the blinds.

My stomach dropped.

The fingerprints were *all over* the window.

And like just like yesterday, there was also another *Cherry Ripe* wrapper but this time, it was on top of the outside windowsill.

I immediately bolted outside; my heart was pounding.

I examined the wrapper that was left on the sill, and it was exactly the same as the one from the other day. The fingerprints were also similar to the ones from yesterday, but something was different about them.

I have no idea if my eyes were playing tricks on me or if it was the sun, but I swear some of the fingerprints had a red tinge to them.

I quickly checked the side gate just in case, but it was locked. Just like how I left it.

I decided to go out to the shops again to buy a security camera and I know it might seem like I’m being paranoid about this, but that this point, it’s better to be safe than sorry.

I set the camera up outside my window and I made sure that it was out of sight.  I also installed the app that came with the camera so I could check the footage the next morning.

Despite my growing anxiety, I managed to fall into a deep sleep that night. Maybe it was because I felt safer knowing the security camera was there. Knowing that I might find out what was really happening.

My eyes flew open and I jolted up. My blood ran cold.

There was a sharp *scratching* sound against the window. It was like fingernails against a chalkboard but 100 times worse

I winced in discomfort at the sound and opened the blinds yet again.

There was nothing, again.

"This is getting ridiculous." I thought to myself. I groaned in frustration AND fell back on my bed.

As I attempted to fall back to sleep, I wondered what had made that sound. I tried not to dwell on it, because the more I thought about it, the heavier the pit in my stomach became.

I groggily woke up the next day. I definitely didn't sleep well last night.

I nervously opened the blinds...again.

My face paled, and the pit in my stomach grew heavier than ever before. I felt like I was going to be sick.

There were now small scratches *all over* the window, and, of course, there was also the brown fingerprint smudges as well as the *Cherry Ripe* wrapper.

Before I went outside, I wanted to check the security camera footage.

My eyes widened when I saw the footage…

It was *static*.

I bolted outside as quickly as I could.

I stopped still once I came to the window and bile rose in my throat. There was something shiny hidden below the window.

*It was a pocketknife*.

And right next to the knife, my newly brought security camera laid in shambles.

"That bastard." I mumbled to myself as I picked up the pieces and the knife.

I immediately jumped back in horror.

There were specks of *blood* on the blade.

I genuinely felt like I was going to throw up. I started to freak out. "Who the hell was doing this?" I was starting to spiral. This is getting too much now.

I pocketed the knife, the candy wrapper, and the security and I threw them into the trash. I came back to the window to investigate further.

I hesitantly moved closer to the window. The fingerprints had a red tinge now and some of the scratches as well.

I decided to finally call the police. I didn’t want to call them before because I didn’t want them to think I was overreacting but, enough is enough.

They told me to call them as soon as I heard any tapping or scratching during the night, and they also mentioned that I shouldn't open my blinds if I heard these sounds again.

The rest of the day felt like a blur. All I could focus on were the fingerprints, the knife, and of course the *Cherry Ripe* wrapper.

Finally, night came and it was time to sleep. Honestly, I was *not* looking forward to it. But, what else could I do at this point?

I can't remember how long it took me to fall asleep that night, but somehow, I eventually did.

My eyes bolted open, and my heart was pounding.

Once again, *someone* was tapping on the window

I didn't open the blinds this time; instead, I immediately called the police, trying to be as quiet as I possibly could just in case.

Honestly, I don't think I've ever felt that anxious as I did at that moment. I didn't want to mess this up. I just wanted it to be over.

Luckily, it only took 5 minutes for the police to arrive and in that time, the tapping sound had stopped, and I was so sure that whoever was doing this had got away.

But,

I was *very* wrong.

At around 3:00 a.m., the police arrived, and shortly after, they found an unconscious man outside my bedroom window.

He wasn't in the best shape, and it seemed like he was probably on drugs or under the influence of alcohol (probably a mix of both) and he also looked homeless. 

But the most interesting thing of all was that he had a *Cherry Ripe* wrapper in his pocket.

The police took him into custody and that was that.

I haven't heard any tapping or scratching during the night after he was taken away, but I still had a lot of trouble sleeping at night. I still felt somewhat uneasy.

I was eventually prescribed some sleep medication, and I’ve been sleeping well ever since.

Well, that is, until a couple of days ago…

One morning, I was greeted by the sun, filtering through my blinds.

“Today was going to be a good day,” I thought to myself as I went to go opened them.

My heart stopped.

Right in the middle of the window, there was a message smeared onto the glass made up of bloody fingerprints.

My face paled as I read it.

**"I SEE YOU."**
