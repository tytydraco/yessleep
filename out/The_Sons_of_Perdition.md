I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building we found a secret room! And guess what was in it? More books! I even found a journal from David Rockefeller. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.

My name is David Rockefeller. It is 1875 and I am 35 years old.

After I had been inducted by the Caesareans I had put my money into their standard oil operation. I wasn't actually the head of it but I was the public face.  We got very rich very quickly as the world and America began industrializing and needing our oil.

In 1875 I got a message from Hugo.

Hugo was the leader of the Cesareans and I thought he had done a terrible job. Accepting the land octopus peace treaty was the first and only good decision he made as our leader, as far as I was concerned.

Hugo had sent me a message telling me that there was oil to be excavated in the grand canyon and that he needed me there ASAP.

I took him at his word at first but then became incredibly suspicious as I thought about what he had wrote.

On the long drive there I thought about it a lot, and just knew he was lieing to me about something.

When we reached the perimeter I got a briefing on what was actually going on.

Apparently Saren was buried here and they were going to dig him up and kill him. Hugo had lied to everyone so that as many people as possible would show up apparently.

I went to the dig operation and studied our defenses. We had gas powered guns lined up everywhere pointed at the dig site, giant pieces of artillery were everywhere too. Two great apes stood watching while the third dug with the men. There were barrels of nitro glycerin at the top of the canyon too, just ready to be rained down.

I went too the dig site, where Hugo and the other men dug with the great ape. There were a few mechanized shovels as well. They were clunky and new and broke down so often they more trouble than they were worth.

"So you had to lie to get everyone here? What is your problem, we all would have came anyway. I really hope you know what your doing here, if we can't kill him this is the worst idea ever, and I want you to know I'm watching you, and I have my suspicious." I jeered at Hugo.

Hugo looked at me with his glowing gold eyes,  green skin and dragon teeth and smiled  The demon of fraud was evident to me. "I didn't think you be man enough to show up down here at the dig site. I thought you would drive home with your tail between your legs kid."

I was angry. "Don't call me kid. You haven't even been alive that much longer than me."

Just then a four winged angel with black halo appeared beside us.

"Yes Maximillian, and yes were going to use you're real name from this point forward. You thought you'd find Saren here but we're at the wrong one bud. The one you are looking for is on mars. We tricked you." The angel said.

A red dragon appeared then and started speaking "Yes Maximillian, you thought you could dig me up and ride me as king of the world, but now you have been outed"

"How dare you speak to me like that in front of my most loyal soldiers!" Maximillian screamed.

The red dragon head the fell off and the skin was shed. It wasctually another four winged angel just like the last.

"Why don't you come dig us up bud, we are buried under the red sea, we'll let you keep your position as king of the people, you'll be our front-man and take orders from us instead of Saren! It'll be cool dude. It's way closer than valles marineris." The angel said.

Another red dragon appeared "Maximillian beat me once and he can beat me again, just dig me up and try it!"

Maximillian ordered the men too keep digging and for hours they continued.

Out of nowhere at 3:33 pm a total solar eclipse started.

The red dragon appeared again "Now I have you! IT is over!"

Maximillian laughed. "I have betrayed you, this is my ascension to power with Saren as true ruler!"

Saren laughed and then his head fell off and it was the four winged angel again.

"Now I really got you didn't I? Wow you are such a fool. Did you really thin id let you get away with this?" The angel laughed. "I Samiaza will stop your plot."

Just then the sky turned blood red and the sun turned into a red eye.

A voice echoed through the canyon "You will all die!"

Just then hundreds of thousands of demons started pouring into sight, filling the canyon one demon high. Demons fell from above us and the nitro glycerin tanks exploded, killing hundreds of demons.

We turned all our weaponry around and began firing into the oncoming haord. We were hitting them with everything we had and shreding them by the thousand, but they just kept coming.

Shells hit demons and Caesaraeans run towards us, trying to create some kind of defensive line.

Everyone seemed to have forgotten about Maximillian but I had not. I watched him from afar, awaiting some kind of move. He just stood there and watched without helping or addressing anyone.

The demons hit our rackshack defensive line and were through immediately. They charged towards as and ate anyone dumb enough to not run.

We were surrounded and couldn't run for long though. All hope seemed lost.

Just as they were approaching the dig site a golden shield appeared and stopped them. They bashed at it with there swords and maces but it seemed they could not damage it.

Someone tried firing a gas powered gun at it shortly after and it went through and hit a demon.

Caesareans then started firing through the shield, moving the demons down as fast as they could.

The endless demos just filled the places of the other demons and awaited slaughter.

The four winged angel appeared again "I Samiza have saved you from Saren and Maximillian's evil plot!"

The men looked at Samiaza and then to Maximillian

one of the men who had heard Maximillian screamed "He has sided with Saren I heard him say it himself!"

Some of the men looked to the Caesarean and then to Samiaza.

Samiaza spoke up first "I have Saved you, now kill him!"

Max screamed "He is a traitor and a liar, kill him!"

A number of the men fired and he dropped dead.

A small number of men, including me had heard Maximillian and fired upon him. He blocked us with his arm like it was nothing. His forcefeild made him all but invincible. We were mowed down on Maximillians command and the one great ape that was on our side was being pelted with gunfire as he blasted back with is energy blasts.

The other two great apes chose not to battle and just watched. They didn't understand.

Just when I thought all hope was lost another shield came up around us. We were still 100 strong. The ape was still alive.

Maximillian looked at us "Traitor" he said to me in particular.

Samiaza appeared with a nail file and filed his nails.

"FIRE!" Hugo screamed.

A gas powered gun along with multiple rifles fired at him from every angle. He put his hands up and wall the bullets richocheted sideways. One bounced off a rock and clipped him, damaging his cloak.

"So you're not invincible then!" Maximillian screamed. He took out a needle and charged towards him.

"Tsetse fly venom. What it kicks in kind of like rabies and you can't sleep. Sends you straight to outer darkness if you don't kill yourself? Thats what in there right? Yeah we're outing you on that too." Samiaza laughed.

A geyser suddenly burst on the ground and tsetse fly's as big as crows flew out of it all landing on Hugo.

"The incels." Samiza laughed. "We call them that because they don't breed with their females, they just fertilize their eggs. Only one needs to get you."

Hugo screamed and slashed and brushed at they, trying to protect his only vulnerable point, his solar plexus.

Some men fired at them, hitting them and Hugo.

Samiza laughed as he stopped the bullets, "Time to make a deal, Caesareans, or ill put down the shield and let those demons get you like Maximillian wants."

"Fire!" Maximillian commanded to the caesareans between the two sheilds.

"You're the traitor I'm with Samiaza!" one Caesarean yelled.

"Me too!" another yelled.

They were immediately shot down on Maximillians orders.

A firefight ensued and many on both sides were killed. Hugo charged from man too man, cutting them down with his damascus steels swords. He had told me he had a 7 and a 6 man sword he kept.

I watched helplessly from inside the second sheild, as those who were with Samiaza were all killed.

They then turned their fire too Samiaza "We will dieing fighting you're evil curse with our leader!"

Maximillian laughed. "You will not corrupt us, Yahweh will protect us from all you have done, and we fear death not!"

Samiaza dissapeared and so did the first sheild. The demons rushed through killing everyone but Maximillian.

"Fools You will be my sacrifices too ascend me!" He cackled at the remaining few before they were eaten alive by demons. He walked around insulting the men as they died.

The demons stood outside the sheild, just watching us. Minutes turned to hours as a starring contest ensued.

Maximillian paced angrily as he waited for the forcefeild to go down.

"This is wrong, many need to die for us to return." Maximillian said, talking to us inside the sheild.

"We know what you are, traitor." I responded. "If even ten of us make it back, they will take our word over yours."

Hugo snarled at me in anger.  "Only two of us can make it back."

I looked at the hundred or so men we had and then back too Maximillian. "What the hell did Saren really promise you? You have teeth, a forcefeild, you're king of the world. What the hell could he possibly promise you that you don't already have. You even killed him yourself! You killed Kutulu, how could you side with him after that?"

Hugo looked at me "His real body is far more powerful. No weapon we have could damage it. And he promised me to rule all worlds as his frontman when he eats Julius Ceasar."

I got so angry my face turned red. "You know that's impossible you fucking fool! What the hell is wrong with you?"

I screamed at him trying to make sense but he walked away.

Hours turned to days and everyone was dyhydrated.

Eventually the demons brought Maximillians wife before us.

"We will be the two that make it back!" Maximillian said.

Just then Samiza appeared. Before anyone could do anything he snapped his fingers three times and Hugo's wife was hideous.

Hugo looked at her in shock. Before he said anything he grabbed her and started eating her as she screamed.

The sheild then went down and we were assaulted by the demons. Men fired at them and we killed many, but were soon overwhelmed.

I ran back and forth between the other men in the carnage until only me and MAximillian were left.

At that point we appeared in the grand canyon again.

"You can run, but I'll always find you!" Maximillain screamed at me. He pointed to his glowing gold third eye. "I can get this too point at anyone I want! You'll never be safe from me!"

Just then Samiaza appeared with a wand knife. "A land octopus can fit through any opening one of it's teeth can enter."

He then went through the opening in Maximillians's forcefeild and gouged out his third eye. Maximillians's Halo turned black.

I got into a jeep and drove out of the canyon. I raced back to my home away from home, the monastary, before I head to st pertersburge to try and warn the remaining Caesareans about Maximillian.
