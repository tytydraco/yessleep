The strange thing about lying on your deathbed is how liberating everything is. The consequences to come are the consequences you can’t avoid, and that perfect little piece that is your existence is firmly put into the puzzle of life by God’s hand. The light that is my soul will be another glowing dot on that never-ending canvas that is the night sky. 

I’m not a very religious man. Haven’t been a whole-hearted, hands-upon-the-ground, belting-songs-loud-enough-for-God-to-hear-and-praise kind of Christian for decades. There was a moment in my life when I thought God would protect me from any evils as long as I had my faith and devotion, but at this point? I’ve said enough prayers and wished enough miracles to know that it’s probably not going to happen.

I do believe there’s a God, I never thought there wasn’t, but I think he’s a little different from what people think.

*“When there’s no one, there is God.”* 

It seems like that’s the case.

So here I am, laying down on my humble bed, with my old blanket over me, my head propped to the side to look out the window. An average man meeting a fitting end. I’ve come to terms with the fact that my life wasn’t meant to be lived spectacularly a long time ago. My inevitable death was a painful warning in my young mind for a while, but when it finally faced me? I accepted it. 

All I have left is the last thing to push off my feeble conscience. A small burden to ease off my frail body. It’s a memory not meant to entertain, but to help me die a little bit easier. Call it selfish, if you will. Call it cowardice, if you must. I don’t have the time in my life to be offended by an ugly truth.

Soon my children, my relatives, my wife will all surround my bed, hold my hand, and cry. They will pile up pillows behind my head to ease my aches, they will rub my shoulders to relieve any tension. Their tears will fall onto my sheets. I’ll smile a sweet farewell and wish my loved ones a happy life like I have lived. My body will finally be put to rest. I would finally die.

And in the afterlife?

I’d burn in the flames of hell.

***

My hometown was small, as these things usually are. It’s nothing unexpected. The rich people had their neighborhoods as did the poor. I was lucky enough to be smack dab in the middle.

I didn’t have the passion or drive to oversucceed academically or in sports, my parents didn’t expect that of me or my two brothers either. They were the type to kick open the backyard and let their three little mongrels play till the sky got dark and the fireflies went to bed. I can still remember when the days were good, when our knees would be stained by grass, our hands sticky with sap, and our mouths tasting of freshly plucked honeysuckle.

I think if the earthquake never happened, then our town would be painfully normal.

Oh, the Earthquake of ‘34. The older kids called it “The Kraken.” A menacing earthquake that hit our town the hardest.

I was too young to remember it, but whenever I mentioned the catastrophe, my parents and my oldest brother, William, would wear blanched expressions and try to change the subject.

From what little I heard, it was a horrible time. Houses were demolished in seconds, families left destitute. Apparently, the town used to be big and bustling, and now its meager existence is the everlasting effect of The Kraken. After the earthquake, there were huge, bottomless, stretching ravines across the town. No one knew why they came to be, why there were so many, or how deep they were, but no one really wanted to find out. We boarded up the houses that had the pits, we gated off any parks that were subject to the ravines. We tried to ignore them best we could.

Us kids called the ravines “Crevices.” William thought that they were the gateway into hell. My second oldest brother Louis thought they lead to another dimension. I, however, just simply thought they never ended. It went down, down, down and had no bottom. Just an utter darkness. Every time we looked at one, a shiver would run down our spines, sweat down our faces. There was something wrong with those crevices. When you look at it on or even come close, you feel imminent horror. The same horror you feel when you see a wild tiger baring its teeth at you. You want to run, you want to cry, you want to simply get away. It was instinctual, down to our DNA, that fear. It was like your own soul was frightened by the things. But there we stood. 

Fear is always blatantly overshadowed by sheer curiosity.

There was a well-known crevice in the overgrown field two streets down from us. It was the only one that I could handle and the only one that my brothers allowed me to go to when I was still young. It was much smaller than the massive splits in the ground that were prevalent in our neighborhood. If we had nothing to do, we’d just go there. You had to leave in the evening, when your pop would pass out on the couch from a post-work exhaustion and your mother would be off in town. You would slip out through the door, run the two streets down, find the hole in the gate, and count your steps to get to it. Thirty seven, I believe. Tall, thick grass made it difficult to spot from far away.

This crevice was still rather dangerous, a medium sized child could easily fall down, but it wouldn’t be a plummeting death, you’d just get stuck a few meters down. If you were smart, you weren’t alone and somebody could fetch an adult and hopefully you’d be safe. Nobody had the luck to be dumb, so every time you went out, you traveled in groups. Three or more, in case one died on the way home.

We’d all grow used to the fear the more we came, and became more bold. Sometimes, we sat on the edge and let our feet dangle out, talking about how deep it must be. Eventually, we were comfortable to the point where we’d even jump over it, laughing and screaming as we did so. The only person who refused to participate was our noble leader William. I knew he was still a little nervous due to his experience with The Kraken.

Our only rule was to not go anywhere close during the night. The darkness made William nervous. We respected that.

These visits were mostly just the three of us. We were very close brothers, three souls who were connected by the hand, a kinship sewn from one finger to the other. That crevice was ours and ours only. Some of our other friends would come once in a while, but every kid in the neighborhood knew that it belonged to us. You only came if you were invited. It was a mutually agreed upon fact.

We were happy children, until a new family moved next door when I was about nine.

The Lindens. They tore down the old house next to ours and were building a brand new one, large and magnificent. Powerful, square-shouldered parents with an equally intimidating pair of children. All four members of the family had blond hair that glowed in the moonlight and pale blue eyes that stared into the soul. The two children were twins, both of them only twelve, just like me at the time. Mary and Phillip.

“Mother told us to be friends with you.” Was the first sentence Phillip told the three of us. It was around evening time, all five of us on the sidewalk between our houses. They were wearing pristine woolen coats and Mary’s hair was immaculately braided back. It was a shocking contrast between our appearance and theirs. Both twins had flushed skin that didn’t have a single blemish or scar on it. I thought they were aliens hiding as humans. No, aliens wasn’t the right word.

Me and Louis looked to William, our noblest of leaders, and he shrugged.

“Okay.” He said. Me and Louis nodded as well. We all saw Phillip and Mary’s parents. It seemed like getting on their bad side would end with a death sentence.

“Good.” Phillip said. He didn’t say another word, and Mary was absentmindedly playing with her perfect braid. I realized that they looked a little bit like angels, like the ones that we learned about in church. Yes, angels was the word I was looking for.

“Uh, it’s getting dark out. You two should probably head back home.” Louis said, rubbing his neck. We were planning on going to our crevice today. It wasn’t cold enough to be dangerous, so William allowed it. 

“You’re going out.” Mary commented. 

“We’re boys.” Louis retorted.

“I’m a boy.” Phillip said.

“We’re the outdoorsy type.” William responded.

“We’re all outdoors. Doesn’t that make us all outdoors people?” Phillip asked.

“Are you okay with getting muddy?” William asked. 

“Sure.” Mary nodded.

“Your clothes will get ruined.”

“So will yours.” 

William rubbed his forehead for a second, before shrugging. They seemed adamant enough. 

“Maybe we’ll hit the crevice another day.” Louis patted my shoulder. I was a bit disappointed but there was nothing a tantrum could do. Besides, it’s best if those twins didn’t get traumatized. Although they did interrupt our plans, I felt a little pity for them. They were new in town and probably had no friends.

“Sorry, what? Crevice?” Phillip interrupted, grabbing the sleeve of my shirt. It startled me. The two didn’t look like very touchy-feely individuals.

“Uh...” I helplessly stared at William, who stared right back at me.

“Um, there was an earthquake a while back, and it made these big cracks in the ground.” Louis chuckled nervously, “There’s one we usually go to. Do...do you guys wanna come?”

Phillip turned to Mary, still not letting go of my shirt, and nodded. Mary nodded as well. 

“Yes.” Mary replied confidently.

“Okay, but just a warning...it can be a bit...overwhelming.” William carefully chose his words.

“Okay.” Phillip nodded eagerly.

“Um, okay. Lead the way Louie.” I gestured to my brother. I was feeling embarrassed for some reason. It was a new feeling to have a very beautiful stranger cling onto me like this. I never felt more insecure in my life. Phillip had moved his grip from my sleeve to my hand. I couldn’t look at him. His hand was very soft. My face flushed. My palms were always calloused, it must’ve been rough and uncomfortable for him. I tried to tug my hand away, but his grip was stronger than I expected. I eventually gave up, it wasn’t hurting me.

The walk down the two blocks felt different. The twins trailed behind me, Phillip’s hand still grabbing mine. The smell of winter brushed past us in every gust of wind, the leaves crunching under our shoes. But, I felt a sense of dread, of fear. It reminded me of the first time I ever saw a crevice, how my stomach turned and my heart accelerated. 

I snuck a glance at the two. Both of the children were truly ethereally beautiful. Angels. God’s children under the sky. As an old man, I can definitively say that I had never met a more beautiful person than those two. I would never admit it out loud, but it was the truth. Yet, there was something behind those glowing pale eyes that made my stomach sink. It was a strange feeling.

I shouldn’t have shook my head and carried on. I should’ve wailed and cried and done something.

As we made it to the broken gate, William held it open for Louis and me. When it came to the twins, all three of us pried the metal apart as much as we could. The two moved elegantly in a sense, they got not even a speck of dirt on them, even though they had to basically crawl on the ground to get through. Phillip, once again, latched onto me, and smiled politely. I felt my face turn red again. 

“Now be careful, everyone.” Will warned, as he carefully stepped through the tall grass. We all followed suit. Naturally, I had no problem walking through this path, but I slowed my pace for Phillip’s sake. 

“Sorry, can I?” Mary clasped onto my other hand with a rosy smile. I flushed and shyly nodded. My steps were a lot less adept than usual, and Louis raised an eyebrow when he saw both of them clinging to me. My face burned as we trudged through the damp grass. I had to catch myself a few times when I slipped on the mud.

“Okay, just one thing-“ Will stepped in front of the three of us, “-it’s cold and slippery out. Don’t get too close. I don’t want you to fall in. If you do fall, you better fall feet first, otherwise you’re hopeless. Raise up your shoulders to catch yourself. Your arms won’t be able to open, and the slopes are too slippery. Don’t try to grab anything.” Will demonstrated, his shoulders shrugged up. He pointed to both of the twins, who followed his example.

“If you can’t catch yourself and you fall too deep in, then I’ll stay here while my brothers will run home and get help. No matter how tired you get, you shouldn’t move. By no circumstances should you fall deeper than you have to.” Will warned, his voice stern. I heard this warning before, which came from our father. These rules were brutal but weren’t meant to stir fear. There were too many instances to cover our words with sugar and honey.

“If you slip and you get stuck in too deep, then I’m not sure if we can get you back up. We don’t know what these things are. We haven’t got a clue.” Will finished, his arms crossed. The twins nodded whole-heartedly, before their eyes landed to the crack on the ground.

They both let go of my hands and went to the edge of the crevice. Will made a noise of discontent when they took a few steps too close.

“So no one knows what’s at the bottom?” Phillip asked. Louis shook his head.

Phillip kneeled down and peered over the edge. I heard a small gasp from him and Mary froze as well. They seemed to be in a trance. I saw Phillip lips contort into a wide smile. Mary touched Phillip’s shoulder and they looked at each other. Both seemed astounded, but not frightened.

“Don’t go too close.” William called, walking over to pull Phillip back. Phillip obliged and stepped away, pulling Mary back along with him.

I found myself staring at Phillip’s face. His cheeks were still rosy, his eyes were still glowing. Mary looked a little bit ill, but nonetheless, fine. I didn’t know if I was supposed to be frightened or impressed. The first time you see a crevice is like the first time you drink hard liquor. It’s painful and difficult to manage. Why were their faces not pale with shock? Why was their breathing so calm?

“Aren’t you scared?” I blurted out. Phillip’s mouth twitched upwards in a smile.

“Oliver.” Phillip turned to me. Did I ever introduce myself? “Aren’t you scared?” He gripped my arms with his pale hands, his blue eyes piercing my very soul.

“N-no?” I replied, a little startled at his question, “No, I’m, uh...” I felt myself trailing off, a weird feeling coming over me.

“Are you?” Phillip asked again.

I felt myself not able to breathe, my chest began to burn. A wave of feverish warmth washed over me, and I ripped my hands away from Phillip’s grasp.

“Phillip.” Mary tugged at his jacket. Phillip turned to her. I couldn’t see his expression, but the color left Mary’s face and she pursed her lips.

“Let’s go.” William quickly said. I found myself walking towards him and grabbing his hand, glancing back at the two with unease..

Phillip pulled Mary closer to him, cupping his mouth against her ear but barely even attempting to whisper.

“Him.”

Louis gently guided me away from the twins, all three of us in a pack, constantly aware of the distance we should make between us and the twins. They didn’t have a speck of fear on their faces. Even adults couldn’t manage it, how could these kids? I felt my stomach lurch, something was wrong but I didn’t know what.

***

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I would close my eyes and count my sheep yet sleep abandoned me. My throat was dry, so I carefully got out of bed and made my way to the kitchen. 

I was just about to grab a cup when I heard a noise against the kitchen window. It sounded like someone threw a stone against it. I paused for a second, before making my way to the back door. I unlocked it and peered outside. 

My eye caught a figure standing alone in the backyard.

Their glowing blond hair was muffled in the darkness.

“Oliver!” Phillip’s voice called over, his tone was sweet, nearly even teasing as he waved a hand, “Can you come outside for a second? I want to show you something.”

“Um...what is it?”

“It’s a surprise.”

“My family...” I tried to respond, my voice scratchy. I cleared my throat but still spoke as softly as possible, “My family...my brothers will be worried if I’m not in my room.” 

The moon parted through the clouds and I finally saw Phillip’s face clearly. His hair was shining like silver, his smile was wide and his eyes were bright. *An angel*, I thought.

“We’ll only be gone for a little while. I won’t tell if you won’t.” He put a finger on his lips, his smile growing bigger. I gulped loudly and unconsciously opened the door even more, my feet finding a pair of shoes outside. They were much too big for me, but I pushed that thought to the back of my mind. That feverish warmth was back, but this time I felt relaxed.

“How’d you know someone was up at this time? How’d you know it was me?” I asked.

“Because I planned for it to be you.” Phillip ran up to me and grabbed my hand. His hand was cold this time, freezing. I let him guide me out towards the backyard and out of my property.

The streets were dark, but they were serene. I didn’t know how late it was, but it seemed late enough. My hand was still in Phillip’s, but instead of feeling flustered as usual, I was more uneasy than anything. As we passed a block, I realized where we were going, and I stopped.

“No, Phillip. It’s dangerous for just two people.” I muttered. The boy turned around, my breath caught in my throat. He looked irritated, no, *disgusted*. He gripped my hand tighter and stepped towards me, his face inches close to mine.

“Don’t talk back.” He said sternly. “God doesn’t want you. It just needs a stand-in.” He didn’t say it in frustration or annoyance, but as a matter-of-fact.

God? 

“Wait, what?” I whimpered, now being dragged. How could a person be so strong yet look so dainty? I tripped over the shoes that I put on, I was a fool for wearing them.

“I heard it. I heard its voice. I knew it was here in this town, I heard its faint whispering the second I came.  It told me what it wanted. It knew what was happening from the start.” Phillip began to speak again as we headed to the crevice. “Oliver, it wanted me. It makes sense, I’m an *angel*, am I not?” Phillip turned towards me, his eyes as dazzling as jewels. I felt my face burn, he seemed like he was mocking me. Mocking the thoughts I never dared say aloud.

“What are you talking about?” I spluttered.

“You asked me if I was scared, Oliver. How could I be scared? Oliver, you will help me. A human can’t go to heaven without another taking its fall. Oliver, will you get me to heaven?” Phillip whispered, his head tilted up towards the sky. 

He suddenly stopped, his eyes glazed over.

“It’s not heaven-it’s not God, is it? Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. But, the voice I heard...the things it told me...it makes me want to sing. If there is a God, what I heard was it. Watch, Oliver, watch the night sky part and a golden hand take me away to the land of heaven.” Phillip cried joyously. He reached a hand towards my face, and pressed it again my cheek. It was painfully cold, I winced.

“You’re crazy.” I stared at him after a few seconds. “Why the hell would God speak to you?” I felt myself getting angry. I was still furiously religious at this age, I still was a Christian before anything else, but whatever spoke to Phillip? It wasn’t anything I knew. God wouldn’t do that.

“I was born, that’s why. I’m an *angel*. God told me so, when we were at that crevice. And it told me what it wants.” Phillip grinned, clutching my hand once more and leading me again. I was confused more than anything. Was he mentally sound? Of course not, if he was then I wouldn’t be here.

We got to the gate, and my stomach dropped. It looked like something blew up the gate itself. The wire looked blasted instead of cut, the edges weren’t blunt. The the pieces of metal were scorched black, like it was set on fire. I unconsciously reached out my free hand and touched it. It was still warm. 

“See? God did this for me.” Phillip smiled, “Isn’t he so kind?”

I didn’t say anything. I saw another blond figure some paces away. Mary.

“Over here!” Phillip called, his other arm waving in the air.

He was distracted. I raised my leg and kicked him square in the back. To my shock, his grip didn’t loosen although he did fall. My feet slid in the too-big shoes I had on, and I fell. Phillip stared at me with shock, and I pulled his arm towards me, biting hard on his forearm as hard as I could. The taste of blood exploded in my mouth.

“That’s enough.” Phillip swung back his uninjured fist and slammed it into my cheek. I felt a burning crack and my face hit the floor with a heavy force. The entire right side of my face felt like it was on fire.

Phillip took me by the collar and dragged me to the ravine. He wasn’t even attempting to be gentle, as he finally slumped my body on the edge of the ravine and placed a foot on my back, pressing down hard. My face was hanging over into the crevice.

“Get off me!” I screamed, my voice echoing from the ravine. I tried to turn around but Phillip didn’t budge. That fear, that wretched fear when I first saw the crevice, it was back and it was pounding on my entire spirit with full force. I tasted bile.

“Your brother said...you must fall face down, otherwise you have a chance.” Phillip recounted. His voice was emotionless, monotone, horrifying. “Mary, help me pick up his legs.”

I felt Phillip grip onto my foot, Mary onto the other. Tears fell my from eyes and into the chasm.  I tried to kick his hand away, but it was expected that nothing happened. Their grips were like steel. I screamed again, my voice echoing louder, louder, louder. I was wriggling as much as I possibly could, straining all my muscles and clutching the ground, trying my best not to be pushed in. I wasn’t going to make it. These two were inhumanely strong, how were they so strong? I couldn’t stop crying, my face was stained with dirt and my tears soaked into the ground. Please, I beg of you, somebody save me.

My too-large shoe slipped off. 

Mary lost her balance.

Adrenaline filled my entire being, this was a chance that I had to take. I flipped myself around, my foot colliding with Mary’s knee, my other leg wriggling out of Phillip’s grasp as he got distracted. I stood up and shoved past the two, knocking them down. Mary’s hand grabbed my ankle and I fell, my chin harshly colliding with the ground.

I stared at her, at her beautiful angelic face, splattered with mud and tears, and I kicked with my free leg, my foot slamming against her skull. I heard a sickening crack. Her eyes rolled back into her head, her face lost its color.

She fell back, her head slinking against the edge of the ravine. I kicked at her again, blinded by adrenaline. Her slim figure slipped into the crevice. 

“Mar-“ Phillip stared at where she fell. “Mary!” He shrieked, pulling himself to the edge, trying desperately to reach for his sister. 

*He will get you if you don’t get him.*

I raised my foot back again, smashing it into Phillip’s side. Another crack. Phillip let out a small cry. I lunged at him, pushing him as hard as I could. I wasn’t going to die. Not by his hands.

“Just wait.” He whispered, a breath. I heard his body fall into the crack in the ground. 

I fell back on the ground mere feet away from the edge, tears spilling from my eyes. Fuck, fuck, fuck. I didn’t dare approach the crevice, I could hear Phillip’s wails loud enough. I couldn’t tell how deep they were. All I know was that they both fell face-down.

Fuck.

I stared at my shoe, still on the muddy ground. 

*When there is no one, there is God.*

*When there is no one, there is God.*

*When there is no one, what makes you think you are safe?*

“I have to-“ I mumbled aloud, gripping my hair. I couldn’t stop crying.

*You think you’re safe with your idea of God? Hiding behind white pillars and rosy skies? You think God is a benefactor, a forgiver, a healer?*

*Well, you are alone. But I am here. And I am not God. So, what am I?*

I couldn’t stop crying.

*You begged your God to save your life. Or maybe your God simply decided that two dead was much more interesting than one. Maybe your God was bored after making an earthquake and decided to toy with the people who lived.*

I shakily got to my feet, I felt bile rising up in my throat, but I held back the want to vomit.

*Angels are the sweetest when they fall.*

I stumbled away from the crevice.

*Don’t worry, Oliver, you’re safe for now. I have two little angels to entertain me.*

I ran for my life, I didn’t look back. The gate wasn’t broken anymore, I slipped through the hole and into the night.

***

When they found the twins’ bodies stuck in that crevice, they were mangled. Unrecognizable. Burnt to a crisp. The Lindens moved out in a hurry, their half-built house remaining for decades to come. I have never believed in God since then. I haven’t been in a church for years. I have nightmares of looking up at the ceiling and seeing another dark chasm, that *thing* really being God. I live in fear of the twins, in fear of myself. I still can’t say that I am completely safe. I doubt it..

I have no warning for you. You can’t be warned. If that thing is God, what could you possibly do? Just play its game, keep it entertained. Do what it wants. You have no power.

As I die here, on this bed of mine, I think about what awaits me.

Phillip and Mary’s fates may be one of nightmares.

But I think my own will be twice as vile.
