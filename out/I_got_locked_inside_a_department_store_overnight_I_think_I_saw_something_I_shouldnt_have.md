So I’ll just get a few things out of the way before I go into this, as I think it's needed and I’m tired of being asked the same things. The store in question is a Hursts. I’m not sure how common these are but I know of at least a few within my home state of North Carolina. They’re basically one of those chain hobby/craft shops but with clothing and furniture as well. I was in there getting some supplies for a project I’d been working on for one of my college classes. I’m a marketing major and we had to make one of those annoying little poster board presentations as part of our final for this semester. This happened about two weeks ago on a Saturday. I would consider myself a fairly rational person and I don’t often see things that aren’t there. And no, I do not use drugs. That’s the first question everyone seems to ask after I explain what I saw that night.

Also before anyone decides to call me a dumbass and ask why I didn’t go to the police before writing this, trust me, I did. The 911 operator was pretty convinced I was a junkie waking from some drug-induced nightmare, so I hung up after she offered to send EMS to my house and gave me info for a rehab center. And YES, I went in person to my local police department and filled out a report. They didn’t take me seriously either. I realized that after I spoke to what I assume was every cop in the building that night one after the other. Each one of them cracked a half-smile after I explained what happened and returned to their buddies to giggle in the coffee room. They probably still joke about it. I’m writing this now hoping that someone, anyone, takes me seriously. I’m tired of being laughed at and called crazy so if that’s what you plan to comment, just know I’ve heard it all before. I guess my real hope is that everyone who reads this will stay away from that fucking store.

I worked part-time at a coffee shop across the street from the Hursts and we closed one hour earlier than they did. I’d been procrastinating the poster board part of the final for the entire week and it was due in two days. Not to mention that Hursts are always closed on Sundays. It was Saturday night then so my only chance to go and get supplies before the due date was in the hour I had after I finished my shift, before Hursts closed at 10 PM.

I grew up in this town so I used to go in there a lot as a kid with my mom. I would always wander off to the aisle with all the model cars and planes while my mom browsed the wall of multicolored balls of yarn. The store wasn’t anything special, but I did remember always having a weird feeling when I was there. The huge empty aisles and faint music definitely gave me the whole “backrooms” feeling when I was younger. But that wasn’t at all what creeped me out about the place, it was the employees that did that. Strangers are intimidating when you’re barely four feet tall and spend most of your time talking to toys, but these people were *different*. 

I remember one instance in particular when my mom had me ask one of them where to find fabric scissors. She was occupied with a *dashing* new shade of blue-gray yarn they just got and probably wanted me to get used to asking adults for things. Reluctantly, I wandered around until I spotted someone wearing one of their trademark *puke-green* vests. It was a much older man with a wispy combover. One of the ones you feel a little bad for when you see them working the same job as high-school students. I was right behind him when I mustered the courage to ask him where to find scissors. He didn’t turn around at first so I asked again. When he did turn, he had a grin from ear to ear. 

If I had known the aisle with fabric scissors and cutting tools was on the other end of the store, I probably would have gotten my mom to come with me. The old man walked at a pace that was hard for my little legs to keep up with. When he finally stopped and I realized how far we had gone, I instantly felt the crippling adolescent fear of being separated from your parents. Not to mention being alone with a stranger. He walked about halfway down an aisle and picked up a pair of fabric shears. I was reluctant to take another step and be even further from my mom, but he smiled again and motioned for me to come take a look. It was a pair of old-fashioned shears with an intricate design carved into the finger holds. I remember being mesmerized by the way it shimmered in the fluorescents above. My mom always pinched my ear if she caught me touching the blades of her shears, but this stranger didn’t seem to care. It was almost like he wanted me to touch the blades. He smiled as he held it out to me. My little fingers felt the designs around the pivot and made their way down to the blades so clean I could see my reflection in them. As I curiously ran my finger along the edge of the blades, I barely noticed that he was slowly closing them. I felt a jolt of pain and tried to pull away. My mom shouted from the end of the aisle.

I whipped around and saw her running towards me. “What did I tell you about touching those!?” Tears were welling up in my eyes as she grabbed a handful of tissues from her purse and wrapped it tight against my finger. It was a deep cut, almost to the bone. I started crying before I could tell her it wasn’t my fault. She picked me up and turned to rush me out of the store. I lifted my wet face from her shoulder and was expecting to see the old man get chewed out by my mom for letting me hold the shears. But I swear to god, he was gone. Just like that. She acted like she hadn’t even seen him at all. I remember bawling my eyes out on the ride home trying to explain that someone had tried to cut my finger off but she wasn’t having it, she insisted I had done it myself. “That’s why I told you to get help,” she said while driving me to the ER. Maybe it was just my imagination, but after that day anytime we would go in there together I remember seeing the employees watch me on the way in and the way out, all with that same wide grin.

Fast forward to the present, I was back inside the same Hursts store near close and my childhood fear of the place starts creeping back in. I’d only been in a handful of times since the incident with the shears, even though I’d been working at a cafe across the street for the past two years. That’s recently changed however, I put my two weeks' notice in for my job the day after what I’m about to describe happened. 

I was near the back of the store picking out some jumbo-sized markers when I heard the automated announcement that the store was closing. “Attention Hursts guests, while we appreciate your business, the store will be closing in ten minutes. Please make your way to checkout. Remember, you’re one of us now.” Yep. Creepy as hell. This added to the uneasiness I was already feeling so I grabbed a couple of colors at random and turned to head back to the front in a hurry. What did it for me at this point was the fact the music shut off immediately after the announcement. I didn’t even have Ariana Grande to keep me company anymore. I didn’t see anyone else shopping when I was walking back and realized I was probably the only person left in the store aside from the closing employees, and I could think of no worse company to have. I picked up the pace, turned out onto the main floor, and could see the checkout lines ahead. Nobody was there waiting. Great, I thought. They don’t even know anyone's still in here. I stood around at the front waiting for some tired employee but nobody showed up. I briefly considered just leaving the supplies for my project at the checkout line and dipping, but the thought of losing thirty points on my final made me decide to stay just a little longer. 

My foot was tapping like hell and I started to scan the store for any sign of an employee. Way across the main floor near the edge of one of the paint aisles, I did see someone. My heart sank. Not only because picking out a human face hiding in plain sight is terrifying, but because of *who* it was. It was the old man from years ago. With that same fucking combover. I’ve tried to reassure myself after the fact that it couldn’t have been him. He already seemed like he was on his way out when I was a kid, twenty years later I would have thought there was no way he’d still be out and working a full-time job. But I swear to god it was him, looking right at me. I know it was him because he had that same goddamn smile on his face. I realized he was probably watching me the entire time. My heart started beating out of my chest. I said fuck it, threw everything I was holding onto the checkout, and made for the door. I pushed on the metal handle and then pushed again. Locked. Yep. Locked. The door rattled but didn’t move. I could see my car just outside in the middle of an empty parking lot. 

I didn’t even want to turn around. I was afraid that old fucker would be right behind me, smiling. But my frustration took over and I was turning before I had any time to reconsider. Facing the aisles, I quickly scanned the store praying to god I didn’t see him again. I didn’t realize that *not* seeing him terrified me just the same. At this point, I’m trying to rationalize. It’s just an old man. The dude’s probably senile by this point and doesn’t even know what he’s doing. Nothing to worry about. That’s what I told myself. I was just really hoping he wouldn’t be the only employee left in the store. I needed to get someone to open that door to let me out and I figured I’d probably shrivel up and die if it had to be him. 

I started looking for any other employees or movement in the aisles. I wandered around for a bit, staying away from the side of the store I saw the old creep. I heard a shuffling sound and something that sounded like keys jingling. *Keys.* Bingo, I thought. I walked around a corner expecting to see a store manager. I started saying hello before I turned into the aisle hoping not to scare them. Nobody was there. Just a bunch of necklace chains and cheap metal charms hanging from racks on the shelves.

I felt like I remembered seeing a sign on a door in the furniture section that said EMPLOYEES ONLY so I figured I’d head that way and see if I was right. Every time I turned a corner I looked at the ground first, if I had suddenly met eyes with someone, I’d probably have shrieked like a little girl. I walked through rows of coffee tables and nightstands until I spotted the door I’d seen. I was eager as hell to get out so I pushed on it just to see if it would open, it didn’t budge. I knocked and got no answer. Great, I thought. 

I was beginning to become more annoyed than scared, so I yelled out hoping that someone, even Combover, would hear me and come looking. All I heard was my voice echoing back. Suddenly I had an idea. A lot of corporate stores train their employees to pick up the phone whenever they hear it ring, even outside of normal hours. I pulled out my phone, found the store number online, and called it. A moment later I heard a phone ringing somewhere far off on another side of the store. I waited, waited a little more, and no answer. I called again. I hoped someone in the back would eventually get annoyed and pick it up just to tell me to buzz off and call back tomorrow, but no one did. I called it a third time and started walking in the direction of the ringing. I didn’t run into anyone on the way to the phone and somehow I was glad for it. The eerie silence broken up by the ringtone echoing throughout the store was starting to make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. 

Eventually, I found where the ringing phone was. Far ahead of me, I could see an open employee door, and on the inside was a desk with a landline sitting atop it. I figured my best chance was to walk through the side rooms until I found an exit that only locks from the outside. I made it halfway to the open door when the lights shut off.

I couldn’t even see my hands in front of my face. My eyes were well adjusted to the blinding bright lights that had been on, and the sudden change left me blind as a bat. I’d seen enough horror movies to know where this was going. But again, I tried to keep my cool. I told myself that in reality, I’m just alone in a store after hours, and I need to find my way out. I figured if the lights were off, combover probably already finished closing and was in the parking lot. But alone in the dark, even that reassurance didn’t provide much comfort. 

I reached into my pocket to pull out my phone for a light. I didn’t realize how badly my hands were shaking and I fucking dropped it. I heard a clack and a bounce. I immediately dropped to my hands and knees and started grasping around on the floor to find it. I felt the edge of it with the side of my hand but I was moving too frantically and slid it further away. When I slid my hand along the direction I last felt my phone, I hit something hard. For a brief moment, I thought it was a pair of boots and I was about to be brained. I moved my hand up and realized I was touching the bottom of a shelf, and my phone had just slid into the two-inch gap between the bottom and the ground. 

I tried to squeeze my fingers in but just pushed my phone further back. I yelled some tasteful profanity and kicked at the thing. Something fell off the shelf and shattered. A vase? A mirror? I still don’t know. It was loud enough to nearly give me a heart attack. I stopped like a deer in headlights, my body was rigid. Several quiet moments later, I heard a noise that I’ve prayed one day I’ll forget, but never have.

On the opposite end of the store, something responded to the sound I'd made. I can only describe it as the roar of a massive animal combined with a scream of pure agony. It was loud enough to send a rumble through the entire building. My veins turned to ice and all the breath left my lungs. My fight-or-flight response kicked in immediately. The reaction I had was damn near primal. My eyes had just barely adjusted to what dim light there was so I broke off into a run, leaving my phone behind. I could see just well enough to avoid running face-first into a wall, but outside of that, I was like a rat in a trap. I made a split-second decision and ran in the direction where I thought I saw the open door with the landline. I made it about ten feet before my foot caught on something and I went tumbling to the ground.

I started to lift myself when I heard a noise coming from somewhere a few aisles away from me. I froze. I was still nearly prone so I slowly lowered myself back to the ground and tried to tuck myself underneath a shelf to my right. Luckily the ones on the outer perimeter of the store had a much bigger gap on the bottom so there was just enough space for me to slide most of my body in. Another noise, louder that time. It sounded like something had brushed past a shelf and rattled what was on it. Whatever it was had gotten closer. When I first heard the *scream* it sounded like it was near the entrance while I had been in the very back. So whatever it was had cleared that distance in about twelve seconds. Another noise, just around the corner. I held my breath.

I heard the pitter-patter of bare feet walking on the tile floor. Every few steps I heard what sounded like someone popping a bone or cracking their neck. I nearly pissed myself, I might have. I covered my mouth with my hand. I turned my head and had to stop myself from gasping. In the dim light, I could just barely make out the shape of feet just beside me. But not just one pair, several. It may not have been an even number, something like seven or eight individual human feet and legs and among them what looked like arms and hands also planted on the floor. It stood for a moment before using all of its limbs to move towards what had broken on the floor. The sound and visual made me want to throw up. I could only see a silhouette of the bottom half of *whatever the fuck this thing was.* If all the limbs hadn’t moved together in concert with one another, I would have thought it was a small group of people tightly huddled together. But it was one horrific mass. I could have sworn I heard it making a soft moan, somehow sounding both male and female. Then without warning, a sharp ringing pierced the silence.

The *creature*, as I’ll call it, snapped around at the sound. The store landline had been dialed again. Whoever it was that called Hursts after 10 PM that night, I probably owe you my life. With a god-awful screech, the thing darted out of sight toward the noise. I heard the sound of dozens of hands and feet slapping against the tile floor. I heard a crash as it toppled into the room with the phone, and more screeching. I don’t know what came over me at this point but I knew that was my one and only chance to make a run for it. Through a combination of adrenaline and pure fear, I pushed myself out from under the shelf and started sprinting in the opposite direction. I ran like hell and felt wind whipping my face. Behind me, another scream, this time sounding more human than before. I knew it was after me.

Judging by how fast it had made it across the store before, I knew I had no chance of outrunning it. I needed to either hide again or find a way out, right then and there. I was surprised by how well I could see in the darkness. The huge glass windows at the front of the store let in a lot of light from the street lamps outside. But more importantly, I spotted another open employee door ahead of me. I could hear the hurried sound of bare feet and hands getting closer, crashing into shelves as it barreled after me. I dug deep and ran harder, praying to god I didn’t trip again. My eyes narrowed on the wide open door and I powered on straight towards it. At a near-full sprint, I slipped through the door, grabbing the handle as I went and slammed it behind me. A moment later my pursuer crashed into the door, shaking the entire wall and sending dust from the ceiling down on my head. I quickly locked the door and stepped back, panting.

I hadn’t planned this far ahead so I was fully expecting that thing to burst through the door at any moment, but nothing happened. I felt like I could hear the sound of my own heart about to beat out of my chest. Another moment passed and I finally exhaled, trying to catch my breath. Maybe it knew it couldn’t break through the door, maybe it didn’t want to, I still don’t know. On the wall beside me, I found a panel of light switches and flipped them all up. Only a couple of the cheap fluorescent lights turned on, leaving the hallways mostly shrouded in darkness. I’m assuming the crash against the wall fucked with the wiring. 

I was in a hallway that looked like it ran around the perimeter of the store. Turning to my left, I could see the dim red glow of an exit sign at the end of the hall. I started walking. Part of me wanted to run but my limbs felt numb and I was terrified there would be something else waiting for me in the darkness. So I took my time and tried to walk as quietly as I could, my eyes fixed on the glowing sign, my salvation. Halfway down the hall, I passed an open side door. On the inside a desk lamp was still on, faintly illuminating the room. I paused, something inside caught my eye. 

Poking my head inside, I briefly scanned the room making sure nobody was waiting for me. I stepped inside. On the wall in front of me, there was a row of framed pictures. Employees, probably about fifteen of them in total, I didn’t count. All of them had an ear-to-ear grin. Even with what I had just gone through, their faces made my fucking skin crawl. In the middle was the one face I recognized, just as I had remembered him years ago. Combover. He hadn’t aged a day. Above his photo was a gold plaque: “EMPLOYEE OF THE YEAR.” 

On the wall to my right was a massive corkboard with dozens of small photos and notes pinned to it. I couldn’t make out any of it in the dark so I grabbed the lit desk lamp and carried it over as far as the cord would allow. The board was covered with photos of random customers, taken on the security camera. Some in black and white, some in color. Some were in HD and others looked like they’d come off of a VHS tape or something. A lot of the photos had been written on with a red marker. Question marks, circles, and arrows pointing to one person in the frame or another. But most disturbingly of all, some of them had a *blood type* written underneath a person in the frame. “A POSITIVE,” “O NEGATIVE”, and so on. In the very center of the board, I saw a photo I’ll remember until the day I die. It was me. A photo taken from one of the security cameras while I shopped, completely unaware. Probably the last time I’d come to the store a few years before. A red circle had been drawn multiple times over me. Beneath it was writing I had to lean in to read. “AB NEGATIVE.” My fucking blood type.

I dropped the lamp and ran for the exit door. I hit it at full speed, if it didn’t open I told myself I was going to ram it down. Luckily it did open. The cool night air hit my face and the door closed on its own behind me. I’d come out at the back of the building so I made a wide arc around the store as I went back to my car, I didn’t even want to be near the goddamn walls of that place. As I turned the corner I saw the glimmer of a security camera high above looking down at me. A chill went down my spine.

My hands were still shaking so I nearly dropped my keys several times while I tried to get into my car. When I turned the key I was anticipating to hear my engine refuse to turn over, typical horror movie shit. To my surprise, my dash lit up and the engine rumbled. I hit the gas and sped out of the lot. In my rearview mirror, I’m almost positive I saw someone standing in the shadow of the building on the side I’d just come out from, but I may have just been seeing things at that point.

So here we are. I never went back for my phone and as far as I can tell it's been business as usual for Hursts. Sometimes I’ll drive past and shudder as I watch people going in and out, completely unaware of the horror that stalks those halls at night. Part of me wants to stand outside and yell at people as they walk in but we all know how the police would handle that, especially after how my visit at the station went. I don’t have an explanation for what I saw that night and honestly, I don’t want to know. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened to me if I didn’t make it out, it keeps me up at night. 

You don’t believe me. And that's fine. You don’t have to. You can laugh at this post or call me crazy. You can share it with your friends and tell them it's just some shitty copypasta. You can read it once and forget about it, I don’t care. My only hope now is that by reading my story, the next time you pass one of these stores or need to go in last minute for something like I did, you hesitate. You hesitate long enough that you remember what I’ve told you, and choose to go somewhere else. You’ll chuckle at yourself and think it’s silly, but that’s fine. As long as I save at least one person from getting trapped inside that hellhole, I might be able to sleep again.
