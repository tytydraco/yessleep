My grandfather died about three months ago. It was a shock to the entire family. We had the funeral on a Saturday. It was cold, and halfway through the service it started snowing. I couldn't feel my hands as we lowered his body into the ground. I don't think it was because of the cold. I think it was because I knew it was my grandfather in that box. After the service we went back to my parents' house to read out the contents of the will. The reading was short and relatively simple. Each of his kids got $10,000. My aunt Joni received his truck, my dad got his sizable collection of antique coins (note if we still haven't counted them all, but even before checking their values as collectables it has to be over $50,000 worth of coinage alone), and I received his estate.  

This was a major shock to the family. I had always been the loner. I don't have any siblings, and I never hung out around my cousins. Everyone considered me to be the black sheep of the grandchildren, but there it was in the will. "Jason is to receive ownership of my estate. This is to include the grounds and all property that resides on them, excluding the property already assigned to others previously." 

 

The arguments started quickly among the aunts and uncles about how this wasn't fair and how I am "a total waste" to be given so much. I didn't listen to it for long. It was just older folks bickering as they always do. I was only focused on the sinking feeling in my chest. "He's gone..." I whispered into the cold room. "I never got to say goodbye." 

 

Grandfather lived out in the Rockys. He loved the air up there. It made him feel free from all the worries of the world and the constant nagging of his children. When he moved out West and built his, well you could only really call it a manor or a mansion, up in the woods, everyone had protested because he was getting into his mid 70s at the time. He had just said "Oh please. I've lived long enough around the cities of the Midwest. I want to be away from all of it. And from all of you. "I heard him whisper the last part, but I don't think the others had. He had given me a little wink to acknowledge I knew what he said. None of the protesting did anything to deter him, however. He moved away and had lived up in those mountains for another 18 years. 

 

He would come back to Missouri every year for the holidays. Whenever Thanksgiving and Christmas came around, he would stay with us for the entire month of December since, "It would be too much effort and money for me to go back when I'll be coming right back to Missouri in less than a month." Grandfather had a way with words that would make most people agree with what he had to say, or at the very least, people would tolerate whatever it is he was trying to get them to do.  

 

After everyone had stopped arguing about the contents of Grandfather's will, they started asking me questions. "So, Jason, what do you plan to do with all that land?" 

 

"Maybe you should just give it to us since you would never want to live that far west." 

 

"Have you thought about selling it off. You could make a lot of money that way. Hell! We could buy it from you!" That last one from Uncle Ernie, the greedy bastard always tried to screw me over on this, but the rest hurt. I thought my own family wouldn't be so shitty, but then again, I had never had anything they REALLY wanted.  

 

My parents didn't push me, however. They told the rest of the family to leave me alone, and they would discuss it with me when it was a better time. Turns out that better time was only two days later. "Jason, have you given any thought to what you will do with Grandpa's estate?" Mom said when I stopped by for our weekly supper.  

 

"No, I hadn't. It's only been two days since I found out I owned it, and I've got a lot on my mind" My voice wasn't harsh, but it had an edge to it that shouted, "Leave me alone". 

 

My dad put his hand on my mother's. "We know... Don't let anyone pressure you into doing something. Make your own decisions and do what you want. It's your estate now after all. No one has a claim to it but you." The conversation trailed off into other, less difficult discussions. 

 

After about a week of thinking I decided to look into what was now, my estate. I found that with my income, and savings I would be able to pay for the utilities and upkeep of the estate indefinitely, but I wouldn't have much money left over for things like food. By my estimates, I could sustain myself for about a year if I used all my income and savings to live on the estate. At the same time, I didn't want to sell it. It was the largest item in Grandfather's will, and he gave it to me. Not one of my cousins or my aunts or uncles, to me. No matter what I did with the estate, I was going to check it out and go through what Grandfather hadn't given away in the will. 

 

I took off a week of work to check out the estate, siting bereavement as the reason. They were quick to approve the time off since it was in the middle of January, and they didn't need as many people on in the slower months. I had also spoken to them about what would happen if I decided to move out West. They told me that they would be able to offer me a similar position that would allow me to work remotely. Thanking them I booked my plane ticket and flew to Colorado. 

 

It took me about a seven-hour drive to get to my grandfather's estate from Denver. "Well at least it's practical if I want to go into town." I chucked to myself as I drove down the winding driveway to the house situated about three acers into Grandfather's estate. Tall pine trees stretched around me; their tips laced in snow like the tips of teeth laced in the remains of one's meal. I loved it up here. Grandfather had invited everyone out one year for Christmas, and it was amazing. We hadn't done it for more than one year since according to him. "It's too much trouble to ask y'all to come all the way out here when you are all back in Missouri." I couldn't have disagreed more, but I was only 12 at the time. Being 25 now, I realize that he was right. 

 

As I walked up to the front door, I gawked at the impressive manor that lay before me. It was larger in person. Floor plans and pictures can only show you so much. As I reached the door, it felt like I was approaching a massive beast that was staring down at me with an appraising look. I pulled the keys out of my pocket; they had been given to me by the lawyer when he read out the will. They were normal sized house keys. With the majesty of the mansion in front of me, you would think that it should have some silver key the size of your hand to open it up. Realizing I was being silly, imagining things from stories again, I put the key into the lock and twisted. The door swung open easily, barely making a sound. 

 

Stepping inside the manor, I looked around. “Damn” I breathed out. The interior was impressive to say the least. Two stories and a large spiral stair case leading upwards. It was situated in the front room. From what I had seen looking at floor plans, this was not the only stair case, but it was the most impressive one. I pulled my phone out and looked at the map I had made to assist me in finding my way around the manor. It had been quite a few years since I had been to the manor. 

 

It took me a couple hours to go through the entire manor. Thankfully the house had all modern amenities so I wasn’t affected by the cold outside, and the place was lit up quite nicely by the overhead lights. There was even a chandelier in the dining room, and I found out that the manor had extremely fast wifi. It turns out my grandfather, who had always been an avid hunter, had a massive gun collection. It appeared that he had categorized his collection by what conflicts the weapons had been used it. There were guns from World War 1 all the way up to the current conflicts going on in the Middle East. Some of the guns were extremely rare pieces that cost well over $50,000 on their own. “What the fuck? Grandfather really left all of this to me?” I wasn’t complaining, however. I was a bit of a gun guy myself, and had a small collection at home in Missouri. I had even carried my Glock 48 here with me since I had gotten a CCP a couple years back. 

 

After looking over the rest of the house, I finally made my way into my grandfather’s study. It was a small cozy room that reminded me of his study from back when he lived in Missouri. The walls were lined with large bookshelves filled with copies of various historical texts, and journals from old British and Spanish explorers. I looked over all of this, but my gaze kept drifting back to his desk. I walked over to it and found that there was a single journal on it. The title read “Diarium”, the Latin word for journal. “What’s this?” I opened it to the first page and found my grandfather’s writing. “The journal of Damian Benjamin Hoffman.” The date was January 1^(st) 2017. I spoke into the silence of the study, “This was his last journal... That was last January.” I quickly flipped to the last page. My heart was pounding in my ears. No one had seen him for three months before he died. None of us knew what his last words were. I needed to know. 

 

As I found the last page with writing on it, I stopped breathing and read allowed into the still room. “My health is getting worse. I feel that my time here on earth is coming to an end. Jason, I know you will probably read this, and want to know what my last entry was. You need to know that for the last few months I have dealt with forces that I could not hope to understand. You have to seal it away. You must undo what I have done. I love you, Jason.”
