I've had my mirror for years. This same mirror. It's always sat in the corner of my room, always visible. The gold frame always shimmering in the morning light peeking in from my window.

But I keep waking up at night. I keep seeing her. She sits there. Crying. The sound distant, yet so close, echoing in my ears. Her black hair cascaded over her features, shielding her form from me. Slender hands covering her eyes. Pale knees close to her chest as she curles up I my place on my bed.

All in the reflection of **my** mirror.

Every night. Her soft sobs wake me from my unconscious state, and I can't help but glare at her.

All she ever does is cry. Even during the day. I look at myself in the mirror, her movements just like my own in the reflection. But her face is stained by tears. Red and puffy. Every mirror. Every reflection. I stare into glassy eyes that hold back tears that I've never shed.

Tonight, it's just like every other. I wake up, and all I hear is soft sobs. I look at my reflection in the mirror. Her sobbing form only ever having free will when I am unconscious. 

"Can you please shut your damn mouth? For once. I'm tired and I have class tomorrow." I spoke in a groggy and irritated voice as I opened my eyes to glare at the pathetic girl in my mirror. She glanced up at me, blue eyes brimming with tears as she choked on her own tears.

If I weren't so angry at this girl in my mirror, maybe I would have felt petty for her. Some form of sympathy. Understanding perhaps. But all I felt was disgust. Annoyance as she tried to hold back her sorrow.

"For fucks sake..." I spat angerly as I stood up from my bed, her own body contorting to my will. Walking infront of the reflective surface, I stare at the poor girl. "Just shut up."

The words felt like a command in a way, telling her to keep her emotions to herself. But it was clear she wasn't used to it.

"Why.... why... why did you do this to me....?" The girl whimpered at me, her voice painfully pitiful.

My lips quirked upwards for a moment, skin cracking slightly before I pushed down the urge to smile. She was innocent in this. She had done nothing to me. In all honesty, she was a victim. But I didn't care. I had spent far too long like her. Stuck in **my** mirror. Form shifting to fit whoever stared at me on the reflective surface. Expression forced into whatever they wanted it to be. Body moving as they commanded. But it was my turn now.

"Why? Because I was tired. Tired of all the time I spent I that god forsaken place you're in right now..." I knew she wouldn't understand, knew she wouldn't want to even try. It wasn't that I wanted her to be stuck in there. Fuck, I wanted nobody to be there. But it wasn't that simple.

My face softened a little as I trailed my fingers across the gold frame of the mirror, my eyes following the words etched into it. Distant  memories flooding my mind as i did so.

I missed my family. The family that was surely long gone. My friends. My old life. Everything that was surely gone by now.

Slowly, my hand reached through the reflective surface, gently caressing her cheek with my thumb as I forced a smile to my face. "Don't worry. You... you'll be okay... just... quiet down... it's all you can really do now... until you get your chance..." 

My words were slightly hollow as I spoke, my hand pulling out of the mirror. I knew it would take her a long time to figure it out. She hadn't read the inscription on the gold frame. And I sure as hell wouldn't tell her and lose my chance to live again. 

She seemed to quiet down, even wiping her tears as I looked at her in **my place**. She gave me a pathetic smile, and I gave her a nod before going back to her bed and laying down.

I was glad I could at least sooth the poor girl slightly, even though I know that she will spend just as long of a time, if not longer as I did. I'm not telling her. She won't take it well.

I'm taking her to a pawn shop tomorrow.

I hope someone finds more use for this mirror.
