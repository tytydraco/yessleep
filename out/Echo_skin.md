I wake up to find it peeling. Tiny little slivers of my skin, like misplaced hangnails, flaying off the back of my hand. Not in chunks, not like a sunburn, but slowly, almost politely, like it knows it has its own blocked-out schedule to follow. The morning light hits it in shards through the blinds. I blink, and the flakes twitch in rhythm, like they’re waiting for my signal. The air smells damp, organ-like - the inside of a mouth, an autopsy room before the bleach cleanse. When I hold my breath, I hear it breathe for me. I press my fingertip to it. It pushes back against me softly, shyly, like microvilli unsure about how fast the overtake should be.

Dad walks into my room to tuck me in. “Look,” I say, holding up my hand to show him the bit of peeling skin, but the bit of peeling skin says “Look,” before me. But it doesn’t matter who said it, because dad doesn’t notice anyways. He smiles absently, his eyes tired, and pats the blanket over my knees. “Don’t pick at it,” he says. He doesn’t notice.

That night, I dream of breathing through layers: mine, not mine, mine, not mine, both.

In the morning, it is a flesh glove wrapped snugly around my left hand. With limited dexterity, I flex my fingers to feel the rawness underneath. I skip washing my hands that morning. It tells me the soap would burn.

It’s worse in school. The skin, now draped over the back of my chair like an old jacket, answers questions faster than I do. When the teacher calls my name, two voices say *Here.* It has gained me a bit of a bad reputation. Later that day, I go to the school counsellor to show her the dermic mass I’d shoved into my backpack. She looks at me the way adults look at you when they don’t believe you but want to look like they do. She’s careful with her words, like she’s talking to a delirious fever, then calls my dad and sends me home. But my dad says he still doesn’t see what I’m talking about.

When I walk into my bedroom, the mound of skin drags behind me, a glistening, sluggish, ivory tentacle. If I look close enough, I can almost appreciate the efforts it has put into imitating me - the brown gossamer cowlick curving to the left, the freckle at the corner of my right eye, the scar on my chin from when I fell off my bike in the 4th grade.

It stretches upwards, unsteady, like a knock-kneed fawn learning to walk for the first time. My height is the one thing it has yet to accomplish, but it tries to extend vertically, curious how tall I am today. I sit on my bed, and it inches up my leg, shaving off little flakes of me as it slithers upwards to add to its inventory of Me. I can feel the faint pulse of it, an amphibian heartbeat trying to synchronize with my rabbit-fast one. A whisper comes from it, soft and wet, like the rustle of damp skin on damper skin. I lift my hand to touch it, and it recoils slightly, but then presses back again, insistently, testing boundaries it doesn’t yet understand. It hesitates for a moment longer, then lashes forward, a thin, sticky tendril brushing my cheek. I taste it, a faintly metallic, coppery tang. And then it murmurs, *Not enough yet.*

And beneath my tongue, something answers it back.
