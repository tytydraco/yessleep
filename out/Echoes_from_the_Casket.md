We walk down the cold basement, the lights barely illuminating the wooden stairs. Each step makes a creak as if the house is greeting us.

“God it’s freezing down here” he says as we reach the final step. “And actually a mess…”

The basement walls are a cream color, with pictures of foliage hanging from them. The tile floor is dusty, old obituaries line the floor, along with wilted flowers which give the air a stale taste.

“Is this even safe? Can we even be down here?” I ask, He turns around and puts his hands on his hips.

“Of course, we rented this place. The whole thing is ours for the night! Besides it’s gotta be safe, Airbnb always does safety checks on houses they host, it’s a requirement for it to be safe!”

“Guys, the foods gonna be ready soon. I should head out. I’ll stop and get some drinks on the way back too!” She announces. Her voice echoed down the empty hall making me shudder. I always hated the sound of reverberation, it gives me an eerie feeling like someone is replying…copying.

“Mm alright girl, be safe imma explore the basement a little more.”

“I’ll go with you to get the food” I say, trying to get out of the basement as quickly as possible.

“No you’ve been driving all day, you stay here to relax a bit.” She stops me. “Yeah stay here, explore this place with me, I sure as hell ain’t doin it alone” he butts in.

“I really don’t want to…”

“Aww babygirl are you scared?” He mocks, putting his hand on my shoulder. I shake it off, annoyed.

“Who wouldn’t be? Look at it! It’s an old funeral home. There’s a fuckin casket in the corner over there!” I point at the half opened small casket, still on the gurney.

“Aww relax it ain’t that bad, love abandoned places like this” he says, starting to walk away.

“See that’s the problem, the place isn’t abandoned it’s an Airbnb it’s not supposed to be like this!” I yell but he just keeps walking down the hallway, each footstep echoing.

“Please girl, just stay with him for a second, I’ll be back quick. Hell, you don’t even have to walk down just stay by the stairs, it'll be alright.” She rubs my head as I roll my eyes. Then turns to walk up the stairs.

“I dunno why you guys keep touching me, you know I hate to be touched!” I yell up the stairs at her, hoping he heard too. She turns her head to smile then closes the door a little, leaving me in the staircase alone. I sigh, which echoes, leaving me uncomfortable in this stale air.

I stand at the bottom of the stairs, staring at the door. It’s just right there I could go up and leave the basement it’s that easy! But I keep thinking of the reverberations I’d make while leaving, I can’t bring myself to do it. I stand there, heart thumping looking around me, mainly at the casket. I spot his shadow projecting on one of the room's doors, he’s looking around picking things up, things she should be touching.

“You know that shit probably has like disease and still water or somethin!?” My voice echos and I instantly regret yelling, I anticipate his reply, shutting my eyes tight to relax a little. “Girl, that don’t even make sense, relax I’m alright, germaphobe.” He yells back, sounds reverberating off each wall, I swear I hear it in each room.

I grip the cold rail of the stairs, giving myself something else to think about as I open my eyes. Even though it’s freezing my fingers, I feel as if letting go on the railing gives whatever else is down here a chance to take me into the casket. I shake the thought from my head, I can’t scare myself even more.

CRASH. A glass breaks somewhere down the hall and I jump out of my skin. “Bro what the hell?? Can we just get out of here pleaseee. You’re gonna make us get a fine or something.” I yell down, now my heart pumping so fast I swear it’s echoing down the halls too.

Suddenly, the lights flicker out.

I stand there in the darkness, panicking, I could run, it's right there. But I can’t move, my breathing gets heavy and I swear I hear things moving in the darkness. I call out for my friend but he doesn’t answer.

“This ain’t funny you know! You know I’m not into this kinda joke!” I yell into the darkness, leaving it echoing in the pitch dark.

“I didn’t turn the lights off!” He replies, “come here, turn on your phone light I don’t know how to get out of this room without the light!”

Oh God, I should just leave him down here. It’s his fault anyway. I can’t deal with this. I flick on my light, before I move down the hall I look for a switch and find it on the wall right by the railing.

Unsurprisingly, it doesn’t work. I take a deep breath, stiffing the release as to not make an echo. I shine the my phone around the hallway, finding the casket first. It’s still there it hasn’t moved. I take one last look at the upstairs door before I begin to move, my first step makes a silent crunch as I step on one of the dead flowers.

“Please don’t jump out at me” I yell.

“I won’t, girl, I promise! Just hurry up! I’m getting creeped out in here with these dusty-ass caskets.”

Step-step-step-step. My heart is making more noise than my own footsteps, and I swear I can hear it reverberating against the walls. I accidentally slip a little on an obituary. “Sorry,” I whisper to the person’s picture on it, like some bizarre attempt at respect.

I’m almost there. The light from my phone stretches farther into the room where he is.

“Oh, I see your light! Okay, I’m—” His scream cuts through the air, sharp and raw. It pierces my ears, bouncing off the walls like it’s chasing me.

“I told you not to scare me! Why the hell did you scream?!” My voice shakes, but I get no reply. The silence presses down on me. “Please, stop. This ain’t funny, bro.” I’m more agitated now, the fear twisting into anger as I gather up my strength. My steps quicken, and I round the corner into the room, ready to yell at him for pulling this ridiculous stunt.

“already told you I hate this shi—”

When I shine my light into the room, I catch a glimpse of him being pulled into a casket by a hand with no color. It was pale, almost translucent, like something out of a nightmare. His eyes catch mine, wide and filled with terror, pleading silently for help. He tries to scream, but another hand clamps over his mouth, silencing him.

My breath catches in my throat, and I freeze. My hand shakes so violently I almost drop the phone. Every instinct is screaming at me to run, but my legs won’t move.

Something shifts in the corner of my eye. Slowly, I turn the light toward it. Another casket—this one brown, its surface chipped, with wilted flowers scattered across the lower half. The top creaks open.

At first, it’s just the darkness inside. But then, something begins to rise. A figure—a man, or what was once a man—sits upright with a stiff, unnatural motion. His head turns toward me, his neck twisting with the sound of popping and cracking bones. His face is gray and sunken, his jaw slack. A low, guttural moan escapes his throat, a death rattle that sends ice through my veins. I don’t wait to see what happens next. I run.

And something is behind me—I can feel it. I know it’s there, closing the gap with every step. My breath is ragged, my chest burning as I race toward the stairs. Finally, my hand grips the cold railing. I haul myself up, taking the stairs two at a time. The cracks and creaks beneath my feet threaten to send me tumbling, but I don’t stop.

Crack-creak-crack-creak.

The noises blur together with my pounding heartbeat as I reach the top. I slam into the door, shoving it open with all my strength, and burst into the safety of the house above.

Light! I reach light, thank God it’s light! I quickly close the door behind me, and fall to the floor, crawling away from it.

“HAA, I scared y‘all, didn’t I! “ she cackles. I look up at her.

“W-what?” I’m trying to catch my breath, and she’s still dying laughing.

“I heard yall screamin’! It’s alright, I just turned the lights out in the basement! Girl, relax! I was about to go get the food, but I couldn’t miss out on this opportunity-” She continues to talk, but I can’t hear. I stare at her, but I can’t say anything. I want to run, but I can’t move. My heart is beating too fast, my legs are numb and my breath is unsteady.

“ -I’m sorry I know you hate to be scared like that but I couldn’t help it! I-“

KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK.

“You ain’t have to lock it on him” she laughs and walks towards the door.

I can’t stop her, tell her it’s not him, it’s too late. Before she can even reach the door, it slowly opens by itself. In the shadow of the basement door, I see a pale man in a suit.
