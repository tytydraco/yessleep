I never should have gone back down.

The dive had been routine at first. A marine research project off the coast of Nova Scotia, exploring a newly discovered trench. It was deeper than expected, dropping well past the mapped seabed. My team had already marked it as unusual—too deep, too sheer, as if something had carved it deliberately.

That should have been my first warning.

We took turns diving in pairs, but on my second descent, my partner, Reyes, radioed back up after feeling unwell. I convinced myself I’d be fine alone for a few more minutes. I wanted one last look at the anomaly.

Descending past two hundred feet, the water grew thick, visibility narrowing to a narrow cone of light. The trench walls loomed around me, lined with odd formations—jagged but symmetrically spaced, as though something had chiseled them. My stomach twisted, but I pushed forward.

Then I saw the bones.

They were embedded in the trench walls, massive ribs protruding at irregular intervals, too large for any known marine animal. They looked ancient, calcified. But they weren’t fossilized; they had been stripped clean. My gut screamed at me to ascend, but my curiosity won out.

I moved deeper.

That’s when I noticed the movement.

The water darkened as a shadow passed over me, blotting out my light. I turned sharply, my chest tightening. At first, I thought it was a trick of my lamp—just the shifting murk of the deep.

Then it blinked.

Two pale, bioluminescent orbs opened in the blackness. Not eyes, not exactly—too large, too multifaceted, shimmering with an intelligence that I instantly recognized as something **wrong**. My limbs locked up as a slow, undulating shape revealed itself from the abyss. Tendrils drifted in the current, too many, moving too deliberately. It had no face, but I felt its focus on me.

The trench groaned around me, and I felt the water shift—a low-frequency hum that bypassed my ears and vibrated inside my skull. My head ached. **It knew me.**

I exhaled sharply, forcing myself to move. My body didn’t want to, every instinct screaming at me to stay still, not to draw attention. My gauge beeped—oxygen low. I had already stayed too long.

I turned, kicking hard, trying not to look back. But in my periphery, I saw the tendrils extend, curling towards the remains in the wall, **reaching**. A clicking noise reverberated through the water, and I realized something horrific.

It wasn’t hungry. It was **building**.

Panic overtook me. I shot upward, my hands shaking as I adjusted my ascent rate to avoid the bends. The sonar crackled in my earpiece, voices garbled, but I couldn't respond. The thing didn’t follow, but I knew it was still there, watching. Waiting.

When I breached the surface, Reyes and the others were already pulling me onto the boat. My mask came off, and I gasped for air, shivering despite the mild temperature. They asked what happened. I didn’t answer.

We packed up that night. No samples, no data. We told the university the trench was unstable, too risky for further study.

I still dream about it sometimes. The clicking sound, the pale lights in the dark. I wake up feeling like something is missing—like some part of me is still down there.
