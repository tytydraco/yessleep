**Hello.**  
By the time you read this, I’ll be dead. My name is **John Thone**, and I’ve spent my life working on particle colliders—but if you're reading this, you already know it was all for nothing. It's June 20th, 1968, and I’m writing this as the clock runs out on what’s left of me.

It all started I think 18 years ago, when I was hired for a mission that seemed more like a fever dream than a reality. They promised me **instantaneous travel**, a key to unlocking the future—and the edge to win the cold war arms race! We were stationed on a secretive island, hidden away in the **Caribbean**, far from any prying eyes. Our task? To bend the very fabric of time and space for military supremacy.

We thought we were *mastering science*. Instead, we were **playing god**.

It was just over a month ago. We were running a routine test—nothing unusual, everything within expected parameters. The hum of the collider was steady, the data streams clean. We were sipping coffee, watching readouts scroll by.

Then—**something went wrong**.

Without warning, the containment array overloaded. There was a blinding flash, followed by a thunderous shockwave. In an instant, more than twenty of our colleagues were **vaporized**—reduced to ash and memory. The blast tore through the facility like shrapnel made of light: twisted metal screamed as it sheared from its moorings, shards of superheated alloy embedding themselves in walls, consoles... flesh.

I couldn’t move. Whether from shock or sheer disbelief, I was rooted in place, eyes locked on the **scar** where the machine had once stood.

In its place was a **rift**—a vast, luminous distortion in space-time, roughly circular, swirling with a chaotic mix of light and motion. It wasn't just glowing; it was *alive*, its edges constantly folding, reforming, reacting as if aware.

Then something **emerged**.

Beyond the coils of exposed wire and burning metal, a shape began to take form, First, the snout—**broad, squared, and brutal**. The skin was mottled in hues of **dusty plum and earthen brown**, stretched taut over slabs of muscle and thick bone. **Scars** crisscrossed the surface, pale ridges from long-forgotten battles. The nostrils flared—wide and muscular—testing the sterile air like a predator sniffing for weakness.

Its head was massive and unmistakable—**a predator’s skull**, built for crushing. Thick **keratinous brows** arched over small, predatory eyes that gleamed with a strange, unsettling awareness. Not mindless. Observant.

And then it stepped through.

With a deep, reverberating *thud*, one colossal leg crashed onto the scorched floor. Its feet were tipped with talons like meat hooks. The creature's enormous body followed—**powerful**, almost grotesquely muscular, its weight shifting with the fluid confidence of an apex killer.

Its torso rippled with **dense, pebbled scales**, the coloration darkening along the spine. The **tail**—long, counterbalancing, and corded with sinew—whipped through the rift behind it, completing the shape of a **13-meter-long nightmare**.

It didn’t roar. It didn’t need to.

The silence was worse.

The **Tyrannosaurus rex**—the most lethal terrestrial predator in Earth’s history—stood before us, heaving breaths through its enormous jaws, each exhale carrying the scent of something long dead… and now, somehow, alive.

We stared into the past.

And it **stared back**.
