Has anyone here read “A Collection of the Macabre” by T.L. Jameson?

Pretty much as the title suggests, I’m looking for people that have read “A Collection of the Macabre” by T.L. Jameson. I only have the hardback version, which I’ve attached an image of [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QwaSa5vKJ19fZVUNIq9aZIaIK4x705Tg/view?usp=drivesdk). 

For context, I volunteer at the local library, as part of a “give back to the community” scheme at my college. I won’t divulge where exactly (internet privacy and all), but its in a small Idaho town. I like to read, and the Library is a great place to work on my assignments, especially because its usually completely empty save for a few WASP book-clubs that turn up on Tuesdays. As such, having the option to do volunteering here was a big plus, and way better than playing Mahjong at the Old Folk’s Home. 

My job consists mostly of checking that books have been placed back in their correct place — genre, date, etc. Fiction, or non-fiction. I found this book, “A Collection of the Macabre”, in the Political Science section. It didn’t have a blurb, which was odd, so after I looked at the chapter index, I concluded that it must’ve been mistakenly placed in the Pol-Sci section, and placed it into the Horror Lit section, due to chapter titles such as “The Cyst that Consumes”, “A Curse from Ptolemy”, and “Theadora’s Wailing.” It was particularly late at night when I found it, and I was far too tired to bother reading through it to double check, so I concluded that there wasn’t any way that it could have been any other genre. 

The following day, when I checked in at the Library to resume doing one of my assignments, I heard a dull thud behind me. I turned around, and there was the book again, laying open on the floor, it’s rind facing upwards. I found this a bit bizarre, as I was in the Modern History section of the library, and obviously I hadn’t put the book there yesterday. But, of course, people can be lazy, so who was I to assume it was some ghostly encounter, and not just some jerk who liked to make my life harder by placing the book in the wrong section. I had decided I had done enough work for the day, and decided to give it a quick flick through. What struck me most was how beautifully detailed the art for each chapter was - an entire page dedicated to a photo of a painting depicting the chapter’s contents. 

They were all done in oil, from what I could tell, and despite the books yellowing pages, the photos held up fantastically, with each looking akin to a high-res photo of a painting you’d find on the internet, albeit with a slightly aged tint to it. The images weren’t particularly disturbing in any regard, but the depictions of fear or dread in the paintings were very well done, like “Ivan the Terrible and his son, Ivan”, or a Goya piece. Art has never disturbed me, and even if they show horrible images, I can still admire the beauty in the brush strokes, tonal choices, and whatnot. 

I suppose they interested me, somewhat. Such detailed art for classically boring titles. I mean, “The Cyst that Consumes.” Screamed 80s drive-in horror flick. But I was bored, so I read. 

I read the entire book, and it was bizarre. 

The first chapter was my favourite; “The Cyst that Consumes.” Very generic, though grossly detailed. A man in the stone age grew a cyst, which burdened him on his temple. He hit his head, and a cyst formed on it, leading him unable to speak to other people in his tribe. The cyst burst, and he could finally voice his own thoughts to the rest of his tribe, only to realise he’d been speaking to corpses the entire time. They’d long suffered from starvation, with him being the sole hunter. He then walks into the distance, fate unknown.

The artwork was gorgeous; a face of pure uncertain sorrow as he looks to the long mummified corpses of his family. The anguish was painted perfectly, and his forlorn last look as he gazes over his shoulder to his deceased family really cemented the disdain in the story. I almost felt it as my own.

I know I’m not giving it justice, but I think you should all take a read of this book for yourself.

Another chapter that stood out to me was “Freida’s Scream.” The painting depicted, what I would assume, a Viking woman, screaming in anguish over a dead lamb, that she cradled on her doorstep.

It made sense for the story. Freida had struggled with childbirth, so she sacrificed a lamb to the Gods for exchange for a child. Her husband, Vilhelm, was the cause for the infertility, but being a Viking woman of nobility, the blame was cast upon her. She had a child, but it would turn to a Lamb at 13. A lamb would long be dead by then, since it had never grown, and so she’s depicted holding her son who could never live long, turned to mutton. Her father in law eats her lamb son, and she kills herself. Bit of a monkey’s hand tale. Still disturbed me.

Another one was “Many the Few, Many the Many.” An old man named Damian refused to give money to a young chimney sweep. The sweep was one of many who had died in his tight chimney, and so they came back to haunt him enough to make him change. But he hadn’t realised he’d been riddled with lupus, and the reason that people refused his touch was not due to his selfishness. So he died, consumed by the souls that his chimney consumed. Each gritty detail about the way his bone marrow was suckled through his shin, to his brain scalped open to be picked at by silver spoons, made this far worse than a Christmas Carol, like many of you would’ve thought to hear about.

There was one about Anne Boleyn. How she’d known for a while that she would die at the age of 29, because a man in a boat in what would be modern day Camden Canal told her so. She’d be conscious of her neck ‘til death. It was an interesting thought; the idea that people before us knew their fate, yet carried on with it.

I know I’m not giving it justice, but I think you should all take a read of this book for yourself.

This one is definitely in my top two most disturbing. “He Cried at his Shoes.” The painting was dull, just a man crying at shoes that couldn’t fit him, but it enticed me. The story followed a man who’d had a daughter, in China, who was fantastic at dancing. She was supposed to become someone special. He had helped to train her, encourage her, until the Japanese came in and murdered her. I won’t divulge horrible details, just imagine the rape of Nanking. The poor man put on his daughter’s shoes, and danced himself off into the Yangtze. Yet, because his daughter was too small, her shoes didn’t stay on his feet. So he danced and danced, until her shoes fell off his feet. And he stopped. Plummeted to his death.

Wait, I’d almost forgotten about my favourite. 

It’s about a young woman, who finds a book at the library. She has to work there— it’s part of a college scheme or something. There’s a book there, called “Tales of something…” I can’t remember. Its about a young woman, who is cursed. She is plagued by the persistence of a book, that seemingly won’t leave her alone. It won’t leave her alone until other people read it—seek it. She’s plagued by nightmares that drive her to insanity, of the burden of forcing others who read the book and her tale to face unsightly consequences. There’s a picture, a painting, and it’s of her sharing details of the book, “A Collective of the Macabre” by T.L. Jameson online, crying. Crying, because she knows that no matter what she does to share the story, the book will still lead her to her untimely demise, and of those around her. And once she finishes sharing the details of the book online, on a sight called Reddit, she’ll take a long walk over to the bridge nearby, take off her shoes, place her driver’s license in them, and leap to her death over the freeway. 

I know I’m not giving it justice, but I think you should all take a read of this book for yourself.
