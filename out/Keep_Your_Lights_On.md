I closed my door and flipped the light switch.

Darkness.

After a long day, it was finally time to get some sleep.

I knew the layout of my bedroom by heart, so I blindly walked over to where my bed should have been and collapsed onto it.

I fell onto the carpet.

The fall was so unexpected that I almost landed on my face—I barely reacted in time to put out my hands.

Suddenly filled with adrenaline from the fall, I jumped to my feet and stumbled backwards.

*What...?*

Where was my bed?

Disoriented and panicking, I reached backwards to find my dresser. If I touched that, I could find my way back to the light switch.

My dresser wasn't there, either.

I swung around, reaching for something—anything—but found nothing. That was impossible; my room had furniture near almost every wall.

My room was empty.

Confused beyond belief, and definitely not dreaming, I carefully shuffled to a wall and started running my hands along it.

Soon, I found the door. I reached next to it for the light switch.

The light switch wasn't there.

*What the hell is happening?*

Determined to find answers, I opened the door and stepped out. I'd turn on the hallway light and figure this out.

I walked out onto the laminate floor and left the door open behind me. The light switch was at the far end, so I hugged the left wall as I felt my way forward.

There was a foul smell in the hall, almost like rotten eggs. I tried not to gag as I shuffled along.

I was almost to where I remembered the corner being—where the light switch was—when suddenly I was pressing against a solid wall.

The hallway was now a dead end.

Now I was freaking out. I crouched down against the wall and tried to control my breathing.

I couldn't see. I was in my underwear. In the dark. In some unknown place. It was all happening too fast.

I sat there for a minute, collecting myself.

After I had mostly regained control, I stood up. My best option was to go back to my room and check the rest of the walls more thoroughly.

I hugged the opposite side of the hall as I made my way back, making sure I didn't miss anything.

The smell was getting stronger.

Suddenly, I slipped on something wet and fell forward—landing on a huge pile of something squishy.

The smell was coming from this pile, and I quickly jumped back, disgusted. It was some kind of wet trash, and it had gotten on me. I retched and shook my arms to flick it off.

From my room—down the hall—I heard a door creak open.

*There was another door in my room?*

"Honey?" a voice called.

A chill went down my spine and I froze.

That voice sounded exactly like my mother.

My mother, *who had been dead for ten years.*

"Honey?" the voice repeated. "Where are you?"

I didn't dare respond. That was not my mother. Fear crept in.

"Are you okay?" the voice asked.

It was getting louder, closer to the hallway.

I stood still. My thoughts were racing and my body was paralyzed.

"Are you out here, honey?" it asked.

Something entered the hall.

I heard a series of small clicking noises on the laminate floor as the thing slowly made its way toward me.

"Honey, come out," the voice said.

Horror seized me. The huge pile of trash was the only thing between me and whatever was coming.

I was so afraid I didn't even think—I stepped up onto the pile and tried to hide myself in it. Getting filthy was a small price to pay for safety.

As I started to move aside the oddly-shaped pieces, I touched a roundish object.

My hand brushed over it, and I felt a nose. I felt teeth in an open mouth.

They were body parts. I had been touching body parts.

*I was digging into a pile of butchered corpses.*

I was so utterly terrified that I couldn't scream. My breath caught in my lungs. This may have saved me; the thing would have known where I was if I had.

"Let me help you, honey," the voice said, the clicking of its footsteps getting louder and quicker. It was now halfway between me and the room.

I had to hide. I tried to stop thinking about what I was burrowing into and continued to wedge myself deeper.

"Don't worry, I'm here now," the voice said. It had almost reached the pile.

Frantically, I squeezed the rest of my body into the pile. Soon I was completely covered, and no part of me was visible.

"Honey?" the voice said, moving around the pile.

I held perfectly still, trying not to breathe. The smell was overpowering, and it took all of my willpower not to throw up.

*It's just trash, not bodies,* I thought, over and over. *It's just trash.*

The clicking noises stopped directly next to the pile.

Silence.

Suddenly, I could feel body parts being moved around on the surface. Right above my head.

I had never been so scared in my life. I wanted to scream, to run, but I didn't move.

Some kind of liquid from the dislodged body parts dripped down my face, across my nose, and over my mouth.

It took absolutely everything not to retch. I gagged silently and almost made a noise.

Body parts were being moved right next to me. I was about to be discovered. My own butchered body was going to join this pile.

My heart thundered and its beat roared in my ears.

I heard another voice near the door to my room.

"hE's nOT In hERE," it said. Its voice was unnatural, alien.

The limbs stopped moving. The edge of my arm had been exposed. The thing had almost touched me.

"leT'S CHeCK thE OthER rOOm," the voice outside the pile said. It sounded completely different from my mother's voice—a hideous chittering from an inhuman mouth.

There were clicking noises on the laminate as it began moving away from me, back toward the door.

As the clicking disappeared into my room, I let out a long, shaking breath. I was trembling so hard that a few of the body parts dislodged and silently slid down the pile.

I heard a different door open in my room.

Tears rolled down my face. I just wanted to go home.

They were going to find me when they came back. I needed to escape. My only option was to go back to my room and search for the light switch, or find a different exit.

Driven by fear and desperation, I dug myself out of the pile. I was covered in disgusting fluid from the corpses.

I made my way around the pile and back to the room as quickly and quietly as I could. I listened at the door. Heard nothing.

I stepped inside.

Scared out of my mind, I began blindly running my hands along the wall, moving clockwise. I had to get out of here before they came back.

"Honey, where are you?" the voice of my mother asked, somewhere in a different room behind me.

I was sweating, shaking from fear and panic. My trembling hands flew up and down the walls as I searched frantically.

"Is that you, honey?" the voice called.

It was just outside the room.

Absolute, primal horror enveloped me and squeezed. Adrenaline flooded my body.

I was almost running now as I clawed at the wall. I couldn't breathe. Couldn't think.

"D**O**N'**T** R**U**N."

It was in the room.

It was right behind me.

I screamed in utter terror.

At the last moment, my hands felt a switch.

I flipped it, desperately, still screaming.

The lights turned on. I could see.

Crying out, I raised my hands to defend myself as I spun around.

But nothing was there.

I was back in my room. My real room.

My bed, my furniture, all of it—was back. As if nothing had happened.

I had escaped.

I fell backwards against the wall and sank to the floor in shock.

Looking down, I saw that I was covered in blood. I was too traumatized to react.

I sat there for twenty minutes, weeping. I couldn't stop shaking as I held my face in my hands.

Eventually, I got up and grabbed my phone off the nightstand. Using the flashlight, I turned on every light in the house. Only then did I take a shower.

All of this happened last night.

I haven't slept since. Even the darkness of closing my eyes brings terror. I only feel safe in the light.

I don't know what happened to me, but please, don't let it happen to you.
