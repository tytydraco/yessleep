My name is Allan Psyche. For those of you who don't know me, I'm a journalist who collects stories from people all over about strange supernatural occurrences. I write from a place called the RoseDen, which might be the only place I feel safe from... everything. Safe enough to write about it anyway.

The following is a story that was submitted by a man named Jeffery Carls. Apparently, he's 32 years old, single and lives alone. This story was submitted to me a few weeks ago, and I was personally too busy hiding from a dinosaur I found that wasn't extinct after all to actually look into the story.

The story that was sent in is as follows:



I've worked in the same funeral home for years now. I had a job retrieving dead bodies from wherever they died to bring them in for burial or cremation for a while, but occasionally I also had desk work to do. I have plenty of stories about picking up those bodies, most of them actually kind of funny, like the time I had to work on Halloween and we had Trick or Treaters come to the door of the house I was trying to get the body out of. We ended up propping it in a chair to make it look like a decoration until the kids left.

All in all, nothing too creepy has ever happened to me while I was working out. Working *in* however, there hasn't been anything too note worthy, well, until recently.

This happened a few weeks ago, and it honestly still gives me the creeps. I was working late one night, finishing up on some paper work for a family. It was around 10:30 PM, and the only other person in the building was a woman named Mary, who was doing her own paperwork in her own office down the hall. As I was working, I started to get this weird feeling, not really like I was being watched, more just that I wasn't alone, other than Mary, of course. It was weirding me out, and I swore I kept hearing faint footsteps walking up and down the hall, but I didn't believe in the supernatural and figured it was just Mary. Until I looked up.

I don't know why, I just got this overwhelming feeling that I was no longer alone in my office, so I glanced at the door to see if it was Mary popping in for something, maybe to tell me that she was going home for the night so I knew to lock up the building. What I saw instead made my blood freeze.

Standing in the doorway of my office was a pair of legs. Just the legs, from the knee down, wearing dress pants and dress shoes, like whoever they belonged to would be wearing a suit if the rest of the body was there. The legs faded at the knee. Just simply faded out like a ghost. They didn't move. They didn't do anything. They just stood there. Facing me.

I stared at the legs for several minutes, not really comprehending what I was looking at, too scared to move. I flinched at my phone chiming, and managed to pull my gaze from the door to look at it. I somehow managed to relax a little when I saw that it was my unemployed friend Joe, up later than he should be, sending me a meme that I knew I wouldn't really understand. When I looked back at the doorway, the legs were gone. My heart skipped a beat when I realized this, but then I also realized that I no longer had that same feeling of not being alone. I heard Mary cough down the hall, and suddenly it just felt like another late night at the office. I tried to shrug it off as a hallucination, I was probably just tired and hadn't been getting enough sleep. Not that it made me feel any better that I was suddenly hallucinating.

I finished up my paperwork around 11:00 PM and packed up my things to go home. I stopped by Mary's office to let her know that I was leaving so she would be the only one in the building and needed to lock it up when she left. I decided not to tell her about the leg apparitions. Maybe I should have, but I didn't want to scare her, and it was still creeping me out enough that I didn't really feel like talking about it. We told each other goodnight, and I went home.

The next day at work, I ran into Mary in the parking lot, and she stopped me to talk, looking a little uneasy. She told me that after I had gone home the night before, she started getting the strange feeling that she wasn't alone, then she looked at the doorway of her office, and saw two legs standing there, from the knee down, dressed in a suit.

I've never believed in the supernatural, but I just don't know how to explain that. Nothing odd has happened since, but I could have sworn I heard footsteps walking around upstairs.



While this is my first time hearing about an apparition in the form of a pair of legs, I have no problem believing it to be true. I myself have come across countless apparitions in my life, several on purpose, but most just a consequence of the job. I managed to contact Mary and she was able to confirm the story, but claimed that it was the only paranormal experience that she's ever had. I'm planning on paying a visit to the funeral home mentioned, just out of curiosity to see if I find anything. Although I'm told that the building isn't known for having strange experiences like this often.

Once again, my name is Allan Psyche. You will likely hear more from me, as I receive more stories to cover, as well as documenting my own experiences. I hope to one day understand this strange and twisted world that we live in.

Thank you for your time.
