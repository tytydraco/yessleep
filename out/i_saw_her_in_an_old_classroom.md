I first saw her in an old classroom, standing by the window in the hazy glow of the afternoon. There was a peculiar sense of familiarity as she turned to look at me, but I was certain that I had never seen her before; and if she was startled by my sudden intrusion, she gave no indication of it. Instead, she just stood there quietly with a slight smile.



“Which class are you from?” I asked.



“Are you just going to stand there or what?” She answered with a giggle, tilting her head slightly.



Then I realized I was still standing halfway in the hallway, with only my head craning awkwardly into the room. The classroom was oddly clean in contrast to the rest of the building, whose corridors and railings were already layered with dust. I don’t know what overcame me in that moment, but before I knew it, the door clicked shut behind me and I was already in the room.



“Don’t you eat lunch with your friends?”



“Don’t you?” She smiled with a dimple on her cheek as she added, “Some days I just want to watch the clouds. Do you ever do that? Just… watch things?”



I walked towards the window where she stood. Outside, fluffy clouds drifted lazily across the afternoon, their shadows idling in the school courtyard below.



“Look,” she said, tugging at my sleeve as she pointed into the sky, “that one looks like a rabbit.”



The conversation and the situation felt quite ridiculous, but I found myself drawn to her sweet voice and the snuggly atmosphere, like some cozy afternoon dream. We talked the rest of the time away behind those quiet windows—what about, I don’t remember, but in no time the school bell echoed through the air and lunch break was already over. I stepped away from the wall to leave, but she stayed where she was and did not seem like she was going to follow.



“Don’t you have class?” I asked.



“Don’t you?” A dainty hand covered her laugh. “You’re going to be late.”



“Hm.”



*See you again?*



I lingered for a moment at the door, looking back. But she had already turned to the window again, her silhouette dark against the bright afternoon sky.



Strangely enough, I never saw her anywhere else. She was always there in the room at the same exact spot. My friends were concerned about my disappearances at first, but at some point, they just stopped asking altogether. But no matter—there were rabbits in every window cloud, and all I could think about was the gentleness of her voice, the way she held her head underneath that warm sunlight.



“Don’t you ever leave?” I chuckled as I took my familiar spot next to her by the quiet afternoon. School had already ended, and I had not come at this time before.



She just gave me that slight smile with the dimple on her cheek as the wind gently caressed her hair and her eyes closed with contentment in the warm afternoon light. I could hear her breathing softly, like a cat.



“No.”



The trees were swaying as some leaves began to gently fall, and there was the occasional muffled conversation from somewhere in the distance. I took a deep breath and without thinking, I grabbed her hand. It felt delicate and warm in mine as she looked up at me, widening her eyes in surprise.



“Let’s go!” My heart pounded in my ears as I pulled her away from the window. Her fingers twitched slightly, but she did not let go as she followed my lead.



“Ehhh?? W-wait!”



Her footsteps were light against the spotless classroom floor. The afternoon light seemed to blur slightly as I ran towards the door with her behind me. I stepped through first, tugging her hand gently—and just for a moment, as I turned back to look at her, I saw her there in the doorway, hair soft in the fluttering light, face slightly flushed with that dimple on her cheek, and all I could think of, as the afternoon wrapped softly around her, was how beautiful she was in that moment.



—And then there was nothing, and I was all alone. The abandoned corridor stretched before me as a chilly gust crept quietly through the air, and all I saw was the cold evening light drifting amidst dust motes in an empty, long forgotten classroom.
