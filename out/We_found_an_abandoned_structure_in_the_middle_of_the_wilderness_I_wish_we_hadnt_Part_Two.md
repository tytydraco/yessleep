Alright, I know what you are thinking. What state of absolute stupidity must I be in to have gone back to the structure? I saw what happened to Derrick, and I know there's no rescue to be made. So why would I go back?  
  
Because I had no other choice.  
  
That might not make sense to some of you. In fact, it barely made sense to me. But something deep within me knew that there was no way to move on without returning to the structure. Even if it meant I never made it back.  
  
I took some advice from the comments. I got a hold of a pump-action shotgun and a glock. I don’t know much about them, but I took them out to the range and did a basic level of research until I felt comfortable. I also managed to get ahold of some noise canceling ear muffs, so hopefully they prove useful. However I have decided against bringing anyone else into this. I have to deal with this myself, and don’t want someone else to risk their life for my vengeance quest.  
  
I realize the chances of me surviving aren’t likely, but I want you guys to be informed as far as I go. So my plan is simply to update occasionally when I get the chance into a Google Doc. I have a friend (we’ll call him Nick) who will monitor it and upload the document to reddit if I don’t update within twenty four hours. Of course, this isn’t foolproof because who knows if my internet won’t just drop, but I’ve packed some portable charging devices and a week’s worth of food. Hopefully I shouldn’t need more than that.  
  
If there are no further updates after this, assume I’m dead. And please don’t come looking for me, or try to locate the structure. Just because I am doing the unthinkable doesn’t mean you have to share in my stupidity. If this is my final message, then I thank you all for reading this far.  
  
Update 1 -  
  
So I followed the same trail, everything marked out and planned ahead. I did everything me and Derrick did the first time. Yet when I arrived at the spot where we found the structure, what I had found left me in utter disbelief.  
  
It’s gone.  
  
The structure is not in the spot.  
  
I am taking a break as I sit in the open field, unsure of what to do. This is absolutely not how I expected this journey to end. I really am not sure what could have happened to it in this span of time. But I’m left with no other choice… I can't just search the park aimlessly. I’m going to head back home.

I am not sure exactly what has happened, but I can’t give up here. I need to go back, and I need to find that thing. Whatever it was, that took Emily’s visage, that killed Derrick. I am not going to let it get away with this.  
  
I’ll update after I make it back.  
  
Update 2 -  
  
I have made it back home, and yet again I am hit with a sense of guilt. I had left to finish what I started, yet I never got the chance. I know I didn’t make up the structure, I know I didn’t make up Derrick’s death. None of this is making any sense to me. As I type this out, I really am not sure how to proceed.  
  
Nick probably thinks I’m crazy, and of course I don’t blame him. The fact he is putting up with any of this is insane. I am going to head over to his place tonight and try and settle down, see if we can’t figure something out. Maybe I can even find some time to relax, before focusing back on the mission.  
  
Update 3 -   
  
I went to Nick’s house, and we hung out for a bit. He had some old professional wrestling show playing, so we watched that. It was fun. I almost got my mind off of things. My night was going great, until I checked my phone.  
  
Four missed calls from Nick, and a slew of messages.  
  
Thinking this was some sort of joke, I called him back. Strangely, his phone didn’t ring despite him being on it right in front of me. I watched closely but was shocked when someone picked up.  
  
“Hey man, where are you? You said you were on your way hours ago.”  
  
It sounded exactly like Nick.  
  
I looked up at the Nick who was on the couch. He met my gaze with malice as animalistic intent lay behind his eyes.
