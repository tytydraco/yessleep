Have you ever wanted something so bad, that you would do anything to aquire said thing? Maybe you wanted fame,  fortune, or you just simply want to find the love of your life. Whatever it is, there is a way to achieve these things, with the closet game. 

Before starting said game, understand the risks for playing. If you fail to complete the game, or lose you may find yourself in a realm you are unwelcomed in. It is importent to be alone in your house, that way there are no interruptions what so ever. To begin I will list off the supplys you will need to survive the game.

- A bottle of holy water
- A holy bible
- Flashlight
- piece of paper
- pen
- watch

Now to begin, it must be 10 minutes before 1am, you must have every one of your supplys. You may then enter your closet, it must be a small closet. Once entering, close the closet door and watch the time on your watch. Once it hits 1am exactly, write down your most desired thing on the piece of paper setting it in the Crack of the closet door. Speak the phrase "I wish to play for my desires". To know if it worked glance at your watch, and if it is frozen at 1am the game has began.

The paper you wrote on and placed at the Crack of the closet door, will be gone. Place the Bible in front of the closet door, and recite a prayer of your choosing. There will be a voice on the other side, under no circumstances do you open the closet door or move the bible. It will try to entice you to leave or move the Bible, simply repeat the prayer until the voice stops. I forgot to mention, make sure you have good intentions with your desires. If you don't, I can't guarantee your safety while playing.

The game only will get harder from here. Next you will see a figure directly in front of you.  Do not, and I repeat do not loose eye contact with it. No matter what. Once you are sure it is gone, you may look around again. The voice will begin speaking again, only it will sound like a friend or family member. It will try everything to get you to leave the closet. Remember, it is not real. If you feel a hand on your shoulder, close your eyes and count backwards from 10. Once the feeling of the hand on your shoulder is gone,you may reopen your eyes. Congradulations you are halfway there.

The figure will be back, only it will be right up to your face. Staring at you blankly with a crooked smile, again do not look away or close your eyes. This is how it gets you. Keep your composure. If the figure hasn't left yet, while keeping eye contact reach in your pocket and grab your holy water. Open it and splash it on the thing. It will sound like burning on it, and it will retreat screeching. 

You will begin to have visions of leaving the closet. Visions of a warped version of house, your world, your friend and family, and of yourself. Your warped self may appear in the closet with you. It will then try to convince you to leave the closet, that you are wasting your time. That You will never get what you desire. It will be convincing, but try your best to fight the urge. This is where many fail.

If you succeed, You have one final trial, To accept yourself for who you are, you will again, be face to face with a imagine of yourself and you must accept your own flaws and personality. 

Congratulations, you have completed the closet game. If you glance at your watch, it should be 1:01 am. You may not leave the closet, and you should see what you desire if it is a object. Other things like love, or fame will happen over time. 

My friend played and failed, I haven't seen him since. Please know the risks before playing, is it really worth it?
