I can't remember the last time I saw the sun. I mean, yeah sure, I could figure it out by looking at my calendar, but that kind of proves my point. For those of you who don't know, in the Northern States, it gets dark really early in the winter. If it's cloudy, which it always is in the U.P. in the winter, it can get dark as early as 4:00pm. This is bad enough if you have a normal 9 to 5 job. It's hellish if you work the night shift. 

I work a 10hr night shift Monday-Saturday. From 7:00pm to 5:30am when you factor in the 30min food break in the middle. The factory I work for is basically the only place you can work within a 2hr radius of my cabin, so I don't have much choice. 60hrs a week is killer, but the overtime is double-time-and-a-half instead of the typical time-and-a-half, so we don't usually complain. I'm in my mid 20s, unmarried, and no kids, so it's not like anyone is out there missing me. My goal was to save up enough money to move to Marquette so I could finally join the real world. This never happened. Now I'm trapped working the night shift. 

There are odd things that happen in the dark. When the only light you're used to is LED artificial light, you might start to see things. Nothing TOO crazy like UFOs or whatever, but small things. A deer just out of range of your headlights that isn't really there. Human faces in the shadows that are cast on the trees by your porch lights. Your vision may begin to feel monochrome outside in the snow. I was used to all of these. What I see in the dark can't be explained by nightshift delirium. 

It was January 7th. It was a Saturday. My last shift of the week. I was driving to work and I hit a deer. As any self respecting Yooper would do, I made sure it was dead, and threw it in the back of my Chevy. This has happened to me enough to where it doesn't ruin my day. I even had a bumper guard to ensure my safety. That wasn't the weird part. The weird part happened later. 

After the first 3hrs, it was time for our first 15min paid break and I stepped outside for a quick dart. I went over to check on my deer and all that was left in the bed of my truck was some fur, a hoof, and a big puddle of blood. I took a drag of my cigarette and thought it was strange. It wasn't impossible that a wolf or a bear dragged it off somewhere, but bears aren't very active in the winter and wolves tend to steer clear of the factory. My next thought was maybe a cop rolled up and took it. Also a likely situation. The DNR doesn't like undocumented dead deer. The lack of citation under my wiper blade made that scenario unlikely. My train of thought was broken when the ash from my cigarette cascaded into the blood pool. It shook me back to reality and I realized that I only had a couple minutes to get back to the line. I went back inside and didn't think about it for the rest of my shift. 

On the drive home, I couldn't help but notice just how overwhelming the dark was. It was cloudy and it was a new moon. On top of that, it was unseasonably foggy. I couldn't see anything past my windshield. I was driving slow, even slower once on got to my road. The road I live on is way off the beaten trail. Just a middle of nowhere road. The land that isn't lived on is typically used for timber by various lumber companies. It was thick forest until suddenly and randomly there would be a massive baren clearing. While I was driving past one of these clearings, the fog broke up and I could've sworn I saw someone standing out in the middle. I tried to focus on the figure, but when I looked back, it was gone. 

I pulled into my driveway and slowly drove down it. The trees felt like they were closing in on me. As if they were massive skeletal hands trying to grab at me. I was beyond exhausted and I was certain my brain had betrayed me. I just needed my standard 20hr end of week sleep and I could put this all behind me right? Wrong. When I pulled up beside my door, I looked by my wood shed and saw a dead deer. I got out of my truck, pulled out my pistol that I always keep on me because of the dangerous wildlife, and walked over to the deer. Before me laid a deer that had clearly been fed on. The deer was also missing a hoof. 

As quick as I could without panicking and bolting, I went inside. I locked the door to the wood storage room, locked the main door, and made sure the windows and back door were all closed and locked. I didn't even take the time to turn on the generator. I just started a fire in the wood stove, heated up a can of New England clam chowder for dinner, and went to bed. Other than the low orange glow coming from the little window on the wood stove, it was completely dark. And as I drifted off to sleep, I swear I heard someone trying to open my front door. 

Because of the sleeping pills that I take for sleep, Sunday came and went without a peep. My dreams were haunted with spectral deer and crazed men attacking me. I dreamed that the sun was blotted out and turned to blood. Deer surrounded me and feasted on my flesh. I'm used to having bizarre dreams, but this was new. So specific and so realistic. When I officially woke up, it was 5:00pm on Sunday evening. I decided that I was gonna call in for my Monday evening through Tuesday morning shift. I just was not feeling good. My boss was super understanding seeing as I've only called in sick three times in the three years that I've worked there. 

The reason I decided to call in was because I'd resolved that I was going to get to the bottom of what was happening. And it would be nice to see the sun for once. However, when Monday morning rolled up, the sun was blotted out. The clouds were so thick and gray that it was an ever present dusk. Although my flesh had yet to feel the sun's loving glow, it was nice to see without the help of artificial light for once. The first place I went was the nearest Dollar General to grab the local paper. I was hoping that maybe I'd be able to glean some info from it. I'm not sure what I was expecting to find, but I figured it'd be a good place to start. 

The weekly newspaper I bought had a bunch of nonsense as usual. One title claimed that a man trapped a werewolf at the nearest Mystery Spot. Another had a man ranting about a cannibal ring that operates out of fake hospitals. Just your usual small town conspiracy stuff. The one that caught my eye was about the local asylum. Allegedly, one of their more violent inmates broke out last week. They described him as having long scraggly salt and pepper hair and a big unkempt gray beard. The orderlies said that he had unusual strength for his stature. That he was prone to biting off and eating peoples fingers. The reason he was there is due to the fact that he'd murdered and consumed his family back in the 90s. His lawyers managed to get him instituted instead of imprisoned by pleading insanity. I decided that this information might be relevant, so I tucked that away in my mind. 

I then decided to go to the library to see if they had any more information about this man. Eric, the librarian, lead me straight to the old news that they kept on file. 

Eric: So you heard he escaped huh? 

Me: Yeah. I'm just curious. Wanna make sure I'm safe, ya know? 

Eric: The odds of him surviving this long is unlikely. It's been subzero for the past month. Not to mention the fact that he's in his 60s now. I think we're gonna be ok. 

Me: Maybe. I just wanna be sure. 

The library wasn't much help. His name was scrubbed from the record for some reason. His occupation was also scrubbed. Eric said it's because he was the old sheriff. He said that it was a huge conspiracy by the sheriff's department to keep their public image up. I guess that could be true. Wouldn't be the first time the cops of our town did a major cover-up. Allegedly, this same sheriff was busted for meth and PCP a few different times. But cops gonna cop and they covered it up. These drugs he had weren't normal. They were laced with something called “pitch” on the streets. It caused violent outbreaks, hysteria, and it turned off your pain receptors to give you perceived increased strength. Assuming these are the same guy, that might answer some of the crazed strength claims. 

It was getting dark by the time I left, so I figured it was time to head home. The drive would take roughly 40min and I wanted to get back before it got too dark. On the way home, there was a man walking along the side of the road. He was wearing blue jeans, a red checkered flannel coat, and a gray beanie. As I approached him, he stuck out his thumb for a ride. I slowed down. I had no intention of picking him up, but I didn't want him to jump out in front of me. Then I saw his face. He had a long unkempt gray beard and his face was framed in salt and pepper hair. I hit the gas and sped home. When I got there, I locked up, loaded my gun, and went to bed. 

On Tuesday night, I had to return to work. I didn't want to, but I figured getting back into the swing of things would be good for me. I was only a month or so away from being able to move out. I needed to see this through. I was driving down my long and winding back road when I saw a body laying in the ditch. The person kept bobbing up and down like they were trying to get up. As I got closer, I saw all the blood. I was worried that it was the old sheriff, but they weren't wearing the red coat. I slowed to a crawl and then parked my truck. I pulled out my pistol ready to shoot if I needed to. I crept up to the scene and I saw the man. His face and beard was covered in blood, but it wasn't his. He was on all fours burying his face into the stomach of a dead wolf. The snow under my feet crunched and he whipped around and roared at me. 

The Wild Man: AAAUURRGGGHHHH!!!

He lunged at me, brandishing a buck knife. I let out a scream as I put a few rounds right in his chest. He roared in pain and slumped over. My heart was pounding. My ears were ringing. My blood ran cold with adrenaline. I waited a few minutes before I approached the body. I kept my weapon drawn as I inspected him. I used my boot to roll him over. He was down. As I began searching him for identification, his eyes shot open. He stabbed me in my thigh with his buck knife. I screamed in pain as I backed away. He then got up and began coming towards me. He didn't stand up however. He was on all fours like an animal. He was grunting and groaning. Blood gurgled from his mouth. In the assault, my gun was flung from my hand and I was helpless. 

As he loomed over me, I saw his eyes. They were dark. Not brown, but black. I couldn't see any cornea. No iris. Just pitch black eyes. Darkness. He pulled his knife from my thigh and cut my pant leg off. He looked at me. Smiled. Then sunk his teeth into my calf. The pain was unbearable. With each bite, he tore chunks of flesh. I gave up. Like a rabbit caught in a snare, I had resigned myself to death. Tears streamed down my face as I waited for the blood loss to send me into the eternal darkness of death. Then I heard it. 

Eric: Hey! Get off him! 

Then I heard the gunshots. Five distinct shots from a pistol. The Wild Man howled in pain as he ran off into the woods. I looked at him one last time. His bent body illuminated in the moonlight. We locked eyes. He let out a blood curdling wolf howl and he bounded away. The next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital. Apparently Eric drove me to the local hospital, but they then had to airlift me to the big hospital in Marquette. They couldn't save my leg. They had to amputate it from the knee down. I'm now being advised on my prosthetic. I just figured I should tell someone what happened. I just hope the old sheriff or whoever The Wild Man is gets caught. 

It's been six months since The Wild Man took my leg. Eric keeps me updated on the search. The Wild Man has killed and consumed eight people. I haven't gone back there. Not yet. For now, I'll stay in my apartment in Marquette healing and getting used to the new leg. I'm slowly getting better. I refuse to be out after dark. Every shadow reminds me of the darkness of The Wild Man. The lights always stay on in my apartment. The only safety I feel is in the light and in the sun when I can see. But every now and then, when the moon is new and the expanse is veiled in clouds, I lay awake in my bed. Listening. And I swear I can hear tapping at my window.
