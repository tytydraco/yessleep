Hi everybody, 

Carol here! To those of you who liked my story, and the few who wrote me personally to request another, thank you! While I appreciate your interest in my experiences, I have to ask you to keep it a little “hush-hush”. I’d really hate for it to get around that I’m sharing all this online, semi-anonymously or not. While there are a million Carol’s out there, I see now I may have identified myself a little too specifically. 
Like I said, everyone knows everyone in Blowing Rock, and I don’t think the folks attached to the resort would be too pleased with me airing out their dirty laundry. Luckily I don’t think too many people around here even know what a Reddit is, so I think I’m pretty well covered. 

With all that said, I’ve got another story for you today. Buckle up! 

This story jumps ahead a bit to February of 2012. It was a slow, slow season. The resort was struggling to make ends meet, and we were all still bouncing back from the big crash of ‘08. Small towns like ours were stuck, unable to thrive like we had when everyone was writing checks they couldn’t cash and taking big expensive family vacations. We survived mostly off locals and a few out of towners who came in on the weekends to take advantage of our mostly empty slopes. 

I was watching the glades on this day, which for those of you who don’t know, are the side trails in the trees. The glade I was assigned to this particular day was mostly flat, frequented by cross country skiers, of which there were none. There were no tracks in the snow save for mine and a few birds, deer, and small four legged critters. 

It was getting to be about lunch time when I heard what sounded like crying from deeper into the trees towards the bottom of the slope.
 
I had set myself up where the trees were thinner and the ground was flatter, expecting that if anyone was gonna come walking this way, this is the route they’d take. Plus, I had a vantage point to the top and towards the bottom of the run. 

The crying got louder, and I was sure at this point that it was a woman. I eyed the trees warily, unsure how deep into the pines this person may be, or if whatever made her cry could be down there still. 

I wasn’t equipped to fight off any menacing wildlife alone. But at the end of the day this is my job.
I kicked off from the top and dropped down into a steep section of the glades, ice, tree roots and fallen twigs making little popping and crunching sounds on my skis as I descended. I finally reached a plateau in the slope, heavily canopied by large, ancient spruces dusted in a fine shimmering powder. It looked like a Christmas card, save for the woman sat on a snow bank facing uphill. 

She looked ragged, that was the first thing I noticed about her. She was under dressed for the weather, which sat in the 10’s, in nothing but jeans and a t- shirt. No shoes, no socks, not even a sweater. Her hair was past her shoulders and unkempt, practically matted into one chestnut colored fuzz ball. Her skin was pale, paler than I had ever seen, and the soles of her feet looked bluish from the cold. 

She was weeping into her hands with intermittent wails of “please, no, please”. I watched her in silence for a moment or two, assessing what I was seeing, before I realized her cries were looping. Like a skipping record, she wept at the same pitch, repeated the same wailing cries, and moved in a choreographed motion of sobs. It was closer to being mechanical than human. 

I slowly approached her, one hand in my pocket fiddling with my radio, and one outstretched towards her so as not to surprise her too terribly. My fingers made contact with her shoulder and she froze. Completely froze. She was deathly silent and still, as if someone had just…paused her. 

I pulled my hand back, startled by the sudden change, but she remained still. I waited a moment, unsure if I should leave her as every fiber in my being was telling me to, or if I should radio in and try to get her down. She didn’t give me the chance to decide for myself though. 

She stood, slowly rising in a way that wasn’t even slightly human. It was then that I noticed just how long she was. It was like her limbs were stretched to unnatural proportions, her legs like a stick beetle, with praying mantis-like arms that dropped from her face to dangle limply at her sides. Her bones were audibly clicking in the silent snowscape, each vertebrae in her spine popping sharply as she straightened herself to her full imposing height. She was easily over six feet tall, maybe seven, maybe even eight. She reminded me of a clown on stilts I had seen at a county fair as a kid. I’m terrified of clowns, and she elicited a greater fear in my gut than any of them. 

It was her face that really got me. As I raised my gaze to meet hers, I was confronted with a sight I still see in my night terrors, twelve years down the line. Her face wasn’t her own. 

Pasted over her own visage was a thick, scabbing swathe of flesh, strapped onto her head like a Halloween mask. It was lopsided, the skin stretched too taunt to ever pass for her own, and the amputated face seemed to be eternally petrified into an expression of anguish. 

The woman, or whatever she was, spoke in the same wailing voice, though she was completely still now, standing in front of me. 

“Please, no, please.” 

I didn’t even look in front of me before I kicked off the plateau and back into the glade. 

I was skiing so frantically I hit my left arm against a tree as I flew by. Got a few good cuts to my face as well from the sharp end of passing branches, thank goodness for my goggles preventing any damage to my eyes. She probably would’ve liked me to be immobilized and blind. Easy prey and all. 

The break in my arm was a greenstick fracture, thankfully, but I had to wear a cast for the rest of the season. The overwhelming fear in me was so great in that moment I didn’t even feel the pain until hours later when it began to bruise. 

I never went back to that run. I even avoided the glades after that when skiing on personal time. There are some things that are just a step too far for me, and that woman was one. 

The next guy who took the post disappeared a month down the line. They found him a little while later up there. The cold had slowed decomposition, but they had to identify him with dental records. The cold had taken the skin from his fingertips, but something else took his face. 

I wonder if she’s still up there sometimes, and who she’s wearing now. I’m just thankful it isn’t me. 

Now to those of you who are wondering about the deer incident of ‘01, that’s not a story I’m too fond of sharing. However, if you really want to hear it, and I mean really, really want to, I can make that my next story. 

That’s all for now folks, stay safe out there. 

Sincerely, 

Your friend Carol
