My name is Pip, and I’ve really debated if I wanted to continue chronicling our misadventures here or not. I'm afraid that writing about Blue and Yellow might have acted like a beacon, and expedited them tracking us down.

We hadn’t started hearing the noises, and Hela hadn’t grown agitated, until after I began writing everything down. Since posting, things have escalated. A violent hailstorm hit and damaged the RV, and a torrent of water flooded the road, trapping us in our campsite. Nothing particularly spooky, just plain unfortunate. We do DoorDash for income, and with the storm cutting us off, our food and gas supplies started to dwindle.

Something remarkable happened when we first arrived at the campground. My cousin Jo is a very spiritual person, and once told me it’s wise to ask permission from the spirits of the land before staying somewhere or using its resources. I kept that advice in mind.

Early that morning, I walked to the edge of the woods and spoke aloud to whoever (or whatever) might be listening. I knew it didn’t need to be eloquent or formal.

“Hello. This is a very beautiful place. Would it be alright if my family and I stayed here for a little while?” I asked softly, watching the woods and waiting in silence.

I wasn’t expecting a clear response, or any response at all, but that’s exactly what I got.

“*You may*,” came a gentle voice on the breeze, like the sound of leaves and bird wings.

I peered into the trees and caught sight of a tall, shadowy figure, vaguely feminine, peeking out from behind a large oak. Goosebumps rose instantly, but I didn’t sense any malice. She seemed… wary, but curious. Smiling, I continued.

“Thank you. I have dogs, but I promise to pick up after them and keep them out of trouble. We’ll try to stay quiet late at night. While we’re here, we’ll do our best to respect and protect your land. Would you be willing to keep us and our dogs safe, too?”

The figure dipped her head in a small bow, then disappeared behind the tree. A shiver ran down my back and arms; every hair on my body stood on end. Holy cow. Was this the Fae?

This was my first real encounter with anything fae, or fae-like, and I’d just entered into some kind of agreement with her. I was more excited than anything, practically running back to blab all about it to Ryn.

Ryn’s reaction was fairly predictable. She let out a weary sigh and shook her head, not the least bit surprised. “So, you met one of your cousins?” she half-joked with a snicker.

I answered with an exaggerated eye roll and a playful shove. It wasn’t the first time she’d compared me to the Fae. Honestly… I wouldn’t even be surprised if my great-grandma had been right about our heritage in that regard.



We spent the next couple of days resting and cleaning up the RV, settling into our new temporary home base. We’ve got a lot of belongings and still haven’t figured out the best system to keep things stable while on the move. I do my best, but there’s always a mess to deal with after we’ve driven any real distance.

You think groceries yeeting themselves across your backseat is bad? Try moving your entire house.

I always follow behind in our SUV, with the dogs riding with me, safe from the chaos tornado that the RV turns our belongings into.

The first evening here, we lost track of time, and it grew dark fast. We were using the generator for light, which made it even harder to notice how late it was getting. Around ten p.m., the generator suddenly died, plunging us into darkness. Ryn tried and failed to get it going again. It had plenty of oil and gas, and there was no obvious reason it shouldn’t be running, or why it shut off in the first place. That’s when I checked the time.

Well, crap.

Ten o’clock was the start of quiet hours for the campground. The sites here are spread far enough apart that no one would’ve even heard our noisy generator, so we ruled out the chance of another camper messing with it. Then I remembered the promise I’d made to the Lady of the Woods, and it clicked.

I offered a quiet apology to the trees, and we finished up by lantern light before heading to bed.

The next day, I made an offering of honey in the same spot where I’d seen the entity, along with another apology for the generator noise from the night before. A warm, comforting feeling spread through my bones, and I took that as a sign that my offering had been accepted. I’d read up on folklore, which said such spirits were receptive to honey, and it seemed like the least harmful way to leave something in the woods.

A few days later, we ended up getting back to the RV much later than planned. The closest town was about an hour away, so it took time to get home, and we usually dash fairly late anyway. By the time we arrived, it was nearly one in the morning. I made sure to keep the pups quiet while transferring them from the SUV to the RV, and a few hours later, I made another honey offering, paired with a soft apology.



The Lady wasn’t the only entity we encountered at our campsite. One night, when we went to let the dogs out, they absolutely refused to step a paw outside. Not even blind and feeble Nova. Hela especially was shaking. She looked genuinely terrified. This was the doberman who didn’t hesitate to lunge at demons, so I took her seriously.

I leaned out the door to see if I could spot anything and caught a whiff of something strange. It reminded me vaguely of a wet dog, but muskier, with a sharp, almost urine-like edge. Honestly, it smelled a lot like the natural musk of wild canines; wolves, foxes, that kind of thing. They can *really* stink.

A lot of people struggle to describe the scent that comes with certain creatures, but that’s exactly what it was to me. It makes sense that most folks wouldn’t recognize it. That’s not a smell you ever come across unless you’ve been up close to non-domestic canids. I had a sneaking suspicion about what it might be, but nothing I could prove.

The next day, I took a bunch of pictures around the clearing, not expecting to capture anything strange. The sunset was particularly beautiful over the mountains, though, so I figured why not. Imagine my surprise when, after examining the photos later, I spotted a very wolf-ish gray furred head peering out from the trees in one of them. That pretty much sealed it for me, and I was absolutely elated. The dogman has been my favorite cryptid for a long time, but before letting myself get too carried away, I went to examine the spot.

Judging by the photo and the natural birch tree markings, I estimated the spot to be around six to seven feet off the ground (I measured). Definitely not a wolf or coyote, even though both are native to the area. I double-checked that there wasn’t anything a curious wolf could have climbed on. There wasn’t, but the ground was full of deep, distorted impressions. Tracks, maybe? I took photos of all of it, just in case. I’m pretty heavy, and my feet didn’t sink into the dirt anywhere near that deep. I gained a whole new appreciation for the size and power of these creatures.

The next (and final) time we encountered it was on the way home one night, not far from the RV. I was going to let the dogs out on the side of the main road, near the entrance to the campgrounds, so they could do their business without making too much noise. Hela, however, refused to budge from the backseat and started shaking. Her wide, panicked eyes seemed to be saying, *GO. NOW. It’s going to eat us!*

I shone my flashlight around and caught sight of a massive shape a short distance away, half-hidden by bushes. Eyeshine way above the ground. I got the impression that whatever it was, it was annoyed at being intruded upon. Animalistic malice radiated off it, but not enough to suggest it would actually attack. I offered a quiet apology, shut the back door and got back in the car as fast as I could, hoping it didn’t change its mind.

I didn’t tell Ryn what I’d seen until we were back home. She wasn’t impressed, but she was grateful I waited to tell her. Of course, she couldn’t resist making another joke about me meeting yet another “cousin.”

Before anyone gets the wrong idea, I’m not particularly brave. Certainly not braver than Ryn. My fear response is just… kind of broken. Ryn says I have the self-preservation instincts of a wet tissue. But I can stay calm in almost any situation, and Ryn has the instincts to know when we need to skedaddle. Together, we make a great team, and we’ve got plenty of gear to keep us and our pups safe.



Fast forward a few days, and we were running low on water. I’d miscalculated and washed a bunch of dishes. We weren’t heading back into town for a couple of days, so we were trying to figure out how to make our remaining water last that long.

Half-joking, I asked if the Lady knew of any nearby water sources. To my surprise, she beckoned. I leashed Kyra to give myself an extra pair of eyes and ears and set off into the woods with an empty jug. Kyra usually walks calmly by my side, never pulling or trying to lead, but this time… she had other ideas. She seemed to be tracking something.

*“Follow the dog.”*

That I did. We made our way through some pretty rough terrain, eventually scaling straight down the side of a steep hill. At last, it opened up into a massive, lush clearing, dotted with purple flowers and a crystal-clear stream meandering through the center. I let Kyra drink her fill and collected some in the jug for later. Of course, I asked permission first. I drank some myself, and we both felt refreshed and invigorated. I briefly let Kyra off-leash, and she pranced and ran around like she was a puppy again. I thanked the Lady, and we made our way back the way we’d come.

The trek uphill was harder, at least in theory, but somehow we had fewer issues than we did coming down. Odd. We got back much quicker than expected too, with energy to spare. Kyra’s blue eyes seemed brighter and clearer. I managed to get some great shots of the creek and a few cool ones of Kyra in the woods. She looked like a roaming wild wolf in some of them.

Aside from Ryn, I kept the experiences with the Lady mostly to ourselves. I knew most people wouldn’t believe me. I returned to the creek sometime later and refilled more containers with water, which lasted until we could make it back to town. I trusted that the creek was fairly clean, but I still filtered it through clean dishcloths over a pitcher, held in place with bungee cords. Then I boiled the water before using it. We all ate well that night, and our next DoorDash shift went smoothly. Things were looking calm and good on the homefront… until they weren’t.

It was the Lady who first warned me that Blue and Yellow had found us again. Her tone carried that same quiet gravity it always did when danger was close. She told me she and the forest were acting as a buffer, keeping them from getting too close. But they could still mess with us, and trail the car whenever we left the forest’s safety. We’d need to be careful. Very careful.



Not even a day after her warning, things started going wrong. The generator sputtered, coughing out weakly before dying altogether. It only worked about half the time we needed it. The SUV began stalling for no reason, gauges flickering.

Then came the eeriest part… and it had to happen on my birthday, of all nights. By then, it had become routine for me to say goodnight to the Lady and her forest each evening. I’d been doing it for a couple of weeks, a small ritual of gratitude before turning in. But that night, as I switched off the generator and whispered my goodnight, something answered back.

It wasn’t the Lady’s voice.

It sounded wrong… like a bad imitation of a human trying to sound friendly, warped and stretched in all the wrong places. Half goat. Half cat. And all wrong.

*"gOoDnIgHt!"*

I froze mid-step and frowned. What the heck?

The Lady’s voice came immediately after.

*"Inside. Now."*

I didn’t hesitate. I obeyed without question.

Ryn wasn’t exactly thrilled when I laughingly told her there was a monster in the woods. I’m not even sure she took me seriously, until the whistling started. Low, faint, and warbled. The woods were otherwise completely silent, which I only realized then.

I sat in the dark with the bedroom window open, facing the woods, just the screen and maybe thirty feet between me and the trees. The whistling grew in pitch, wavered, and wobbled, like someone who’d never whistled before. There was no recognizable tune, just bits and pieces crudely strung together, as if someone was imitating parts of songs from memory and failing spectacularly.

Hela quietly growled beside me, and I knew the other dogs had heard it too. Ryn definitely had. The nearly full moon lit the woods more than I expected, but I still strained my eyes, trying to catch a glimpse of whatever it was.

I was nervous, but determined. I had to know what it was. I even considered whistling back, to see if I could lure it close enough for a picture or video. Seeming to read my mind, Ryn smacked me upside the head and said ‘*hell* no’. The Lady agreed.

*"Don't borrow trouble."*

Something pale twisted in the shadows and kept moving closer. At first, I thought it might be a disoriented old man. He was bald, skinny, and bone white under the moonlight. I couldn’t see any clothing, despite the frigid temperature. His arms were unnaturally long for his body, and he moved in a half-crawl, jerking his head around in a way that didn’t make sense. Like he was sniffing or searching for something.

I slowly reached for my phone, but my hand froze when the head snapped toward me. I can’t say how far away it was. I’m terrible at gauging distance in the dark. Its movements became even more jerky and unnatural. I finally picked my phone up, and the mouth gaped wide open. If this turned out to be 096, I was completely dead.

The Lady practically screamed in my head: "*Close the window. Now."*

The shout nearly made me jump, but I didn’t hesitate. Even Ryn was starting to panic. Hela was panting hard and trying to burrow into my hoodie. I shut both the window and the black-out curtain. Then I turned off our lantern.

Silence. Had it spotted me? We stayed totally still, holding our breath. My hands shook with adrenaline as I started recording on my phone, hoping to catch the whistling, but it never made another sound.

A few minutes later, gravel crunched softly in the clearing. Something was crawling out of the woods. It circled the RV once, slowly, and then slipped off in another direction.

I don’t know how long it lingered out there. At some point, the whistling faintly started again, this time from the opposite side of the clearing.

The other dogs ultimately fell asleep, but ourselves and Hela maintained a steady vigil through the night. We didn’t open another window, or the door, until the sun was fully up. 

If anyone has ideas about what that thing was, I’m open to suggestions. I’m still a little disappointed I didn’t catch any footage, but whatever it was, it reminded me of Shy Guy. Or maybe the Rake. Either way, it was absolutely ugly. I think it was trying to lure someone.



On a particularly warm day, I decided to go down to the creek for a swim. I brought some saffron-infused honey for a third offering, as thanks for protecting us, and donned my SCP hat before heading into the woods. I didn’t take any of the dogs this time. Ryn stayed behind, absorbed in Pokémon on her Nintendo Switch.

By now, I could navigate the woods easily, having memorized the trail to the creek. It usually took about half an hour to climb downhill, and roughly forty-five minutes to climb back up. I left around five p.m. to give myself plenty of time before dark, which was around seven. Thankfully, it was really overcast, so I didn’t have to fear the sun.

The hike down wasn’t too bad, and the air around the creek was noticeably cooler once I arrived. I made my third offering of saffron honey on a large rock in the middle of the stream, then slipped off my shoes before stepping into the cold water. Even in the height of summer, mountain streams are icy. Shivers raced up my spine, but it felt good.

Something drew me to a spot upstream. I carefully traversed the slippery, moss-covered rocks, silently grateful for my abnormal sense of balance. Once there, I felt compelled to sit in a very specific spot. I slowly lowered myself into the water, shivering as I waited to acclimate.

“*Lay down*.”

I hesitated. That water was freezing.

“I’m sorry, what?”

After a moment of reluctance, I squeezed my eyes shut and did as instructed. The shallow water caught me, thankfully preventing any head bumps on the rocks. The cold hit me like a jolt, but slowly my muscles began to relax. I kept my eyes closed, letting my arms spread out in the water, fully surrendering to the chill. The stream was too shallow to float completely, but it was enough to feel weightless.

Then something wet and solid slipped into my right hand. I nearly shot upright, but managed to hold still. Slowly, I opened my eyes and examined it. A creek rock. Slick, green with moss, and fitting perfectly in my palm.

Except it was warm. Strange, unlike the other rocks, which were sensibly cold.

“A-Are you giving this to me?”

“*Yes*.”

It didn’t just feel like I’d been given a gift. It felt like I’d been accepted. It’s hard to describe… like something ancient had acknowledged me, claimed me even. I smiled and stayed there a while longer, letting the cool water flow around me, breathing in the wildflowers and moss.

When I finally rose and offered a soft word of gratitude, I felt lighter. Stronger. Protected. Closer to her. I slipped my shoes back on and started up the trail, the strange warm rock clutched in my right hand. It was vaguely shield-shaped, fitting my palm like it had been molded for me.

The path was the same as always, but somehow it wasn’t. The climb that usually left me breathless felt effortless. My legs barely burned. I was almost euphoric, buzzing with energy.

That’s probably why it took me longer than it should have to realize something was off.

The forest had gone completely silent again. No wind, no insects or birds. The kind of silence that presses against your eardrums until you start to wonder if you’ve gone deaf.

Everything around me was still bright enough to see clearly, but the sky overhead looked… dimmer, like dusk was bleeding in early. Wildflowers carpeted the ground in every direction, more than I remembered. It was beautiful, but wrong somehow.

That’s when I realized I didn’t recognize where I was.

I’d taken this path dozens of times. There was no reason it should’ve changed, yet the trees seemed unfamiliar, older. Watching.

A faint tug brushed the back of my mind, a compulsion to leave another honey offering at a gnarled tree just ahead. But the Lady’s voice broke through, calm but firm: “*Ignore that. Keep walking.*”

The whispers started then. Soft, indistinct voices that flitted just out of range, accompanied by faint shapes darting at the edge of my vision. Every time I turned, they ducked behind the trees again. The air felt thick, humming with static.

That’s when the buzzing in my ears began. Not loud, but constant, like the world itself had started vibrating. And for the first time, I understood the saying about tension you could cut with a knife. It felt eyes boring into me from everywhere. You know that feeling when someone is staring at you? Multiply it, and you’ll have the faintest idea.

I turned and started walking, slow and careful, following a pull that I could feel deep in my chest. It was like a magnet lodged behind my ribs was tugging me somewhere specific. It just *felt* right, and that alone was unsettling.

The rock in my hand had grown warmer, almost hot against my damp skin, but I wouldn’t let go of it. Each step made it pulse faintly, like it had its own heartbeat. Somewhere off to my side, I heard heavy, deliberate pawsteps keeping pace with me. Violet, my guardian spirit. I don’t usually hear or sense her that strongly unless something’s *really* wrong. The realization put me on edge, but it was also comforting. If she was there, I wasn’t alone.

The forest had taken on this strange, otherworldly stillness. The colors were wrong. The flowers practically glowed, sharp and vivid, while trees, earth, and sky looked muted. I caught myself thinking how nice it would be to *stay* there. Just stay.

The whispers agreed. They promised safety, warmth, belonging. My eyes felt heavier.

But the Lady’s voice cut through the fog, calm and resolute: “*Keep moving forward.*”

So I did.

It felt like I’d been walking for hours. My body didn’t ache, my legs weren’t tired, but time felt slippery and stretched thin. Eventually, the forest sounds began to trickle back in. The colors returned to normal. The spell, whatever it was, seemed to lift. Mostly.

I found myself emerging from a different campsite much farther up the road. A family of campers were milling about near their fire pit. Smiling, I nodded as I walked through, but nobody looked my way or acknowledged me. Maybe they were just distracted, but something about it felt strange.

I turned onto the dirt road that linked all the campsites and started the long trek back to the RV. Somehow, the sun still hadn’t set. Ryn had to be out of her mind with worry by now, wondering where I’d gone. There was no cell reception anywhere in the woods, so I couldn’t call to reassure her.

When I finally got back, I unpacked my phone and blinked at the screen. It was only a little past 5:30. Barely thirty minutes had passed in all that time. That… wasn’t possible. Even walking straight to the creek and back should have taken double that. Even using Naismith’s rule for hiking, it would’ve been at least thirty minutes one way, and another thirty or forty-five back. And that's just straight there and back.

I laughed out loud at the absurdity of it all. Ryn, ADHD as she is, hadn’t even noticed I’d left. Hela, though, was fascinated by my new treasure. She kept sniffing it and trying to steal it right out of my hand. The brat.

If anyone has ideas about what that place was, or what might’ve happened, I’d love to hear your theories. It’s been bugging me ever since.



We eventually were forced to seek another location, as we’d stayed too long. Oops. Thankfully, the deep puddles all dried up, so we could safely pass. I thanked the Lady once more, and gave her a heartfelt farewell. We were sad to go. I playfully imagined shadowy creatures loping alongside the SUV and RV as we made our exit in the middle of the night. At least, I’m *pretty* sure they were just my imagination. Either way, I’m sure Blue and Yellow weren’t far behind.

We spent the next day parked at a King Soopers, then continued that night to another camp about seventy-five miles north, not far from Ned. Nothing much happened at this new spot, aside from a moose that occasionally wandered through. There were more people, fewer trees, and it didn’t feel remote at all. Definitely not as active or as strange as the other place had been.

Unfortunately, that also meant we were less protected. Blue and Yellow were still on our tails, making life difficult as always. We had an accident, and our DoorDash earnings were barely keeping us afloat. Over the past three years, we’d sent out hundreds of job applications with nothing to show for it. Workamping didn’t work either. Nobody would take us. Once, I even received an angry reaction to my message on the workamping group.

Faced with no other options, we reached out to Ryn’s mom. They hadn’t been on the best terms, but we hoped for some grace. We needed something to give.

That’s exactly what we got. Ryn’s mom agreed to help fund our trip so we could come stay with her. After tying up loose ends in central Colorado and stocking up on groceries and dog food, we set out on the road. Destination: Wisconsin.

Since we couldn’t afford the repairs or legal fees, the SUV had to be left behind. It was just us, the dogs, the RV, and the long road ahead. I emptied the living room to avoid flying debris and secured the dogs on the couch so they’d be safe, and as comfy as possible

By then, I’d started using the fae-gifted rock as a kind of totem, channeling my energy through it and asking for protection along the way. I could feel it respond, faintly thrumming with warmth in my palm whenever I held it. But the more I leaned on it, the more agitated Blue and Yellow seemed to become. Their presence grew sharper, more aggressive… like they could sense I had something they couldn’t touch.

Our first hiccup came when our right front tire detreaded at seventy miles per hour. Thankfully, we didn’t wreck, but instead coasted to a gentle stop on the side of the highway. It was very late at night, so we ended up stranded a while waiting for businesses to open. Eventually, we found someone to help us swap the tire for the spare… only for the spare to go flat almost immediately.

We limped the RV back into the last town we’d passed (Sterling, I think.) A Les Schwab tire center had just opened that day, complete with grand opening deals. We became one of their very first customers. They told us we’d been incredibly lucky to stop by: three of our other six tires were on the verge of failure. Almost all of them were damaged in some way, and we hadn’t even noticed. That could have ended *very* badly.

Ryn’s mom covered the cost of all the replacements, and the tire shop treated us to street tacos for dinner. Once again, we hit the road. The ride was noticeably smoother and felt safer. I gave the rock a gentle squeeze, keeping it in a belt bag on my person, its warmth a quiet reminder that we weren’t entirely alone.

By the time we made it into Nebraska, we’d thankfully managed to leave Blue and Yellow behind in the dust. For the time being. We made it through Iowa and arrived at our destination of Wisconsin over the following weekend. We’re officially in the Midwest!

I think distance definitely helps slow the demons down. Our biggest problems when we arrived back in September were about a million mosquitoes and 100% humidity. You know what, though? That’s nothing compared to being hunted. We’ll take swatting bugs over dodging Blue and Yellow any day.

We’re now less than an hour from the infamous Bray Road, so… who knows what’s waiting for us. At least the weather is finally cooling off. *Very* rapidly now that it’s November.

Stay tuned. Something tells me our misadventures are far from over.
