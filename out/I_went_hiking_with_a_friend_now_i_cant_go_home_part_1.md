The jingle of my alarm dragged me out of a shallow, restless sleep. I sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing the heaviness from my eyes before shuffling toward the bathroom. Cold water splashed over my face, sharp and bracing, chasing away the last traces of fatigue. I gazed at my reflection In the mirror, a faint shadow of stubble crept along my jaw. Brown eyes half-lidded, and my blonde hair stood in electrified disarray.

After scarfing down a banana for breakfast, my phone buzzed. Right on time, I thought, pressing it to my ear.

“Hey, sleepyhead,” came a familiar singsong voice, dripping with sarcasm. “I’m outside. You ready to go?”

“Yeah, just about,” I replied, my voice still heavy with sleep. “Just need to grab my bag—I’ll be down in five.”

“No problem, bud,” the voice shot back, teasing as always.

I couldn’t help but crack a smile as I hung up. I grabbed my hiking bag, gave it a quick once-over to make sure nothing was missing, then slung it on my back, locked the door, and headed outside.

James was waiting on the curb in his Tacoma. As I approached the truck, I noticed an open can of Monster Energy sitting in the cupholder. Knowing him, he’d already drained half of it.

“Hey there young man,” James called with a wicked grin as I got closer. “How much do you charge for an hour?”

After tossing my bag in the back and climbing into the passenger seat, I smirked and shot back, “Fuck off.”

Satisfied, we began the long four-hour drive to the Sunshine Coast Trail.

I was born and raised in British Columbia, Canada. The Pacific Northwest has always been my home—a place of towering evergreens, mist curling through the valleys, and the kind of crisp, resin-scented air that clears your lungs with every breath. For as long as I can remember, those deep woodland greens have given me comfort.

It wasn’t until a few years ago, though, that I began to explore the land more deliberately. Hiking started small: modest 6 km (3.7 mile) trails like Jugg Island and Buzzsaw Falls, the kind you can finish in a morning and still be home in time for lunch. Gradually, my ambitions stretched farther. I found myself drawn to more demanding treks—like Black Tusk, with its jagged silhouette stabbing the skyline, one of the first that truly tested me.

Each year, I raised the stakes a little higher. Each trail left me hungry for the next. This trip was no exception. We had planned it months in advance.

The longest trail in Canada, the Sunshine Coast Trail stretches a whopping 180 km (112 miles), winding through a remarkable variety of landscapes—ancient rainforests thick with moss, rugged alpine ridges, quiet coastlines, and hushed streams tucked into shadowed valleys. What sets this trail apart is its hut-to-hut system. Scattered along the route are roughly sixteen backcountry huts, each offering weary hikers a roof and a place to rest before continuing their journey. It was the beginning of September, where the weather was just starting to cool, and summer relented to fall.

The goal was to complete the hike in ten days. It should have gone off without a hitch—*should have been* the key word.

The Tacoma rumbled onto the highway, its tires drumming a steady rhythm against the asphalt. Morning light spilled through the windshield in golden bands, flickering as we passed stands of evergreens. The city fell away behind us, its concrete and noise replaced by winding roads, mist-hung valleys, and the occasional glimpse of ocean winking silver through the trees.

We rolled the windows down, letting the air rush in—cool and damp, carrying the faint tang of salt from the coast. James nursed his drink, one hand on the wheel, while I leaned back against the seat, letting the hum of the engine and the blur of passing scenery pull me into a quiet calm. The farther we drove, the more the world seemed to loosen its grip: no emails, no buzzing phones, no deadlines. Just the open road and the promise of what lay ahead.

“How’s Kelly?” I asked after a few moments of comfortable silence.

“She’s great!” James lit up instantly, his voice warm and unguarded. “We’re still figuring out when to hold the wedding. And she’s only a year away from finishing her master’s in engineering. I swear, man, she’s the smartest person on the planet.”

I could hear the pride in his voice, and I was genuinely happy for him. Still, a flicker of envy stirred in my chest. He was engaged; I was still single. He owned his apartment, I rented mine.

I know they say comparison is the thief of joy, but I couldn’t help myself. James had always seemed a step ahead. In the last couple of years, I could feel him drifting further from me, which is part of why I leapt at the chance to do this long-ass hike together.

He immigrated to BC from Newfoundland when he was seven. On his first day of elementary school, I saw him sitting alone, absorbed in a set of plastic dinosaurs. I walked over, asked if the T-Rex could beat the Triceratops, and just like that, we hit it off. Nearly twenty years later, we’re still best friends.

At 6’5 and nearly 230 pounds, James was hard to miss. A true Newfoundlander through and through, with thick brown hair covering most of his body and a beard that seemed to grow faster than he could shave, he looked less like a man and more like some wild thing dragged in from the woods. Though he was on the bigger side, a near decade of playing rugby ensured his cardio was on par, if not better, then mine.

The rest of the drive passed in an easy blur. James and I talked about everything and nothing—the newest video games, ridiculous animal facts, half-baked political takes. The conversation wandered without direction, the way it always did, but that was the comfort of it. With James, nothing was ever off the table.

About an hour from the trailhead, we rolled into a lonely gas station off the highway. The neon sign buzzed faintly in the morning haze, promising fuel, coffee, and sugar in equal measure.

“Want anything?” I asked as I unbuckled my seatbelt.

“Another Monster and some beef jerky would be great,” James said.

I snorted. “With a diet like yours, how are you still alive?”

He didn’t even blink. “Spite.”

I shook my head and pushed open the door while James stayed behind to fill up the truck. Inside, the air smelled faintly of burnt coffee and cleaning solution. I grabbed a Monster, jerky, a couple protein bars, candy, and two muffins, piling them into my arms before dropping everything onto the counter.

The cashier looked ancient, her face a map of deep lines, her thinning gray hair twisted into a bun at the back of her head. She moved slowly, methodically, scanning each item one at a time. While she worked, I let my eyes wander. Behind her, tacked to the wall, was a cluttered community board, its surface crowded with fading flyers and curling papers. One of them caught my eye—a missing-person poster, tacked crookedly to the corkboard. Unlike the faded garage-sale ads and yellowing church notices, this one looked fresh, the paper still crisp, the ink dark. Two faces stared back at me.

 One was a man, he looked to be in his early fifties, shaggy black hair streaked with gray and stuffed beneath a baseball cap. The photo had been snapped mid-laugh, probably at some game—his wide grin a frozen moment of joy.

Beside him was a younger boy, maybe eighteen. His photo seemed more candid, taken at a beach. Shirtless, slightly pudgy, his ghost-pale skin stood out against the sunlit backdrop, a sharp contrast to his shoulder-length black hair that clung damply to his neck. His eyes were wide, unguarded, brimming with an innocence that felt almost out of place against the somber context of the poster. There was something unfinished in his gaze, like the promise of a life that had barely begun.

Beneath their photos, bold block letters read:

**MISSING**  
Ronald Varg (52) and son, Steven Varg (18).  
Last seen: July, traveling Sunshine Coast trail  
If you have any information, please contact—

“Such a shame,” came a withered feminine voice, jolting me out of my thoughts.

I looked up. The cashier had paused mid-scan, her wrinkled hands hovering over the register. “They came in here a couple months ago,” she said, shaking her head slowly. “Seemed like such nice folks. Damn shame about that bear attack.”

My eyes narrowed, refocusing on her. “You think a bear got them?”

“That’s what they’re saying.” She leaned forward slightly, as if letting me in on a secret. “They found their camp about three-quarters of the way up the trail. Tent ripped wide open—huge hole in the side. Bits of bone, clothing, dried blood… scattered all over the place, but no bodies.”

There was a strange lilt to her tone, a spark of excitement threading through the horror. Out here, I guessed, stories like this were currency. Company was rare, and tragedy—even second-hand—was something to talk about.

She straightened up, shaking her head again. “If it wasn’t a bear,” she said, her voice trailing off into something almost gleeful, “then I don’t know what could’ve done that kind of damage.”

“I guess I’ll keep my bear spray close by at all times,” I said with a half-hearted chuckle, eager to steer us away from the topic.

The old woman gave me a knowing nod, her expression unreadable. She slid the last muffin across the scanner, the machine beeping sharply in the quiet store. “That’ll be twenty-six seventy-eight,” she said.

I pulled a couple crumpled bills from my wallet, trading it for a thin paper bag that sagged under the weight of caffeine and sugar. The cashier handed me my change with papery fingers, her eyes lingering on me just a moment too long, as if she wanted to say more but thought better of it.

“Have a good hike,” she finally said, the words carrying a weight that felt more like warning than farewell.

As I stepped back into the morning light, James was just sliding the fuel hose into its holster. He noticed me coming and lifted his brows in a quick, wordless greeting.

“Got everything?” he asked once I tossed the bag of food onto the back seat.

“Yeah,” I said, shutting the door. Then, after a pause: “Oh, by the way… we have bear spray, right?”

James gave me a look—head tilted, brow furrowed, like he was trying to figure out if I was joking. We climbed into the truck.

“Of course. Picked up a brand new can a couple weeks ago,” he said. “Why?”

I told him about the cashier, the missing persons poster, and her story of the shredded campsite halfway up the trail. As I spoke, James kept his eyes on the road, his usual smirk fading into a more thoughtful line.

When I finished, he let out a long breath through his nose, then glanced at me, one hand tightening slightly on the wheel. “Sounds like a hell of a way to go, doesn’t it?”

The rest of the drive we tried to outdo each other with tales of the worst ways to die—being eaten alive by swarms of insects, flayed and left in the desert, boiled alive in some ancient bronze cauldron. Each story got darker, more grotesque, but we laughed anyway, the way people laugh when they know the subject should be off-limits. The truck groaned as James threw it into park. We had made it.

James hopped out of the truck and began rummaging through his bag.  
“Two seconds, buddy,” he muttered, digging around with the focus of a man who had buried treasure in there. “Promised I’d give the old battleaxe a call when we got to the trailhead.”

With a small grunt of triumph, he pulled out a satellite phone. It wasn’t anything fancy—scuffed casing, bulky antenna, the kind of tech built for utility, not looks. He began thumbing the buttons before stepping a few paces away for reception.

James stepped a few paces away, holding the bulky satellite phone like it was some sacred relic. He jabbed at a few buttons, waited, then spoke, his voice low and clipped so I couldn’t make out every word.

“What are you wearing?” he growled, a shit eating grin tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Yup, all good so far, no issues. Yep… yep, we’ve got the food, the gear… everything’s set.” He paused, listening, then nodded. “Don’t worry babe, we’ll check in every couple day. Love you too.”

He ended the call, sliding the phone back into his bag with a satisfied nod.

I watched him, noting the faint tension in his shoulders as he exhaled. It was the kind of precaution that reminded me we weren’t just heading into a normal hike. Out here, the wilderness had its own rules. Then we set off.

When planning a long, multi-day hike, every ounce counts. Too much weight on your back and every step becomes a slog. James and I had tried to plan for everything, weighing each item against its necessity.

My pack was a carefully curated collection of essentials: food—mostly canned, dried, smoked, or bagged goods like trail mix and candy—water bottles, a couple changes of clothes, lightweight tent, sleeping bag, flashlight, first aid kit, small hatchet, can opener, and bug spray, and a water filter bladder.

It was a simple yet brilliant design: fill the bladder with water, hang it from a tree, connect the tube to your bottle, and in ten or fifteen minutes, you had clean, safe drinking water. The thing was almost magical in its simplicity, a little slice of civilization in the middle of the wild.

James’s pack told a different story. Where mine was organized and precise, his seemed to reflect his personality: big, bulky, a little chaotic, but somehow perfectly functional. He had his own food stash—energy bars, beef jerky, a half-empty bag of chips he insisted “was essential”—plus a tangle of ropes, a small cooking skillet, and a sleeping bag stuffed into a compression sack that looked like it had seen better days.

Despite the differences, it worked. Our packs balanced out in weight, and more importantly, they reflected the balance between us—my meticulous caution, his laid-back confidence.

Together, we were ready to take on the trail. After about an hour of walking, we arrived at Sarah Point Shack, the first of the shelters offered along the route. Perched atop a rocky ridge, it overlooked the Salish Sea, the water stretching out in endless silver-blue waves. I could already imagine the sunset painting the sky in shades of gold and crimson, though that moment was still hours away.

The shack itself was small but sturdy—weathered wood, a tin roof, and a simple porch that jutted over the cliff’s edge. It was quiet here, almost reverent, the kind of silence that made you hyper-aware of every creak in the floorboards and whisper of the wind through the pines.

James set down his pack with a grunt and stretched his arms above his head. “Not a bad spot for a first stop,” he said, scanning the horizon with a grin. We stopped for a quick sip from our water bottles, the forest quiet around us. That’s when I noticed James’s eyes light up.

“Oh! I completely forgot to show you!” he said, nearly bouncing with excitement. He dove back into his bag like a kid on Christmas morning and pulled out a flare gun.

“Where the hell did you get that?” I asked, a wide grin spreading across my face.

“Cabela’s,” he said, almost shyly, as if admitting it was a guilty pleasure.

The flare gun was a striking sight: a bright blood-red barrel, a warm brown stock, and a bright shade of yellow on the hammer.

James held it carefully in both hands, his grin never fading. “It’s already loaded,” he explained, as if reading my mind. “For emergencies.”

“That safe?” I asked, one eyebrow arched. “What if it goes off in your bag?”

James shrugged casually. “Then I’ll probably burst into flames,” he said, deadpan.

I stared at him for a moment, half horrified, half amused. “Alrighty then,” I muttered, shaking my head with a grin.

He just laughed, tucking the flare gun back into his pack like it was the most normal thing in the world. The forest around us remained quiet, oblivious to us. We set off down the trail once more. It was nearly 10am, and we wanted to cover a good distance before nightfall. Most of the time, we walked in silence, letting the forest speak for itself.

Birdsong drifted down from high in the canopy, bright and melodic, though the dense mossy trees often hid the singers from view, though the moss-draped trees often hid the singers from sight. Sunlight filtered through the leaves in shifting patterns, warming patches of the trail while leaving others in cool shadow. We lost the path more than once—the trailhead wasn’t always clear—and had to double back in search of it. The thick, trees made navigation difficult, every direction looking much the same. I could imagine a less experienced hiker getting turned around in here. The earthy scent of damp soil and pine filled the air, grounding us in the rhythm of the hike. Around 1 p.m., we passed Bliss Portage Hut, eight kilometers behind us, and by 4 p.m., we had reached Manzanita Bluff, another eight kilometers further. We were making solid progress, the miles accumulating steadily beneath our boots.

Just after 6 p.m., as darkness began to settle over the forest, we decided it was time to make camp for the night. Although it had rained only a few days before, a fire ban was still in effect, so we set up our tents quietly, the wet earth soft beneath our feet.

Dinner was simple—muffins and cold chili—but it filled the void. My body was completely drained, every muscle aching, and I used a splash of water to rinse the sweat from my forehead. The cool trickle was a small mercy against the heat that still clung to me from the day’s climb. Around us, the forest grew hushed as the last light thinned, shadows stretching long between the trees. Night was coming quickly, and tomorrow’s trail would demand every ounce of strength we could gather.

We passed the time with cards under the soft glow of James’s electric lantern. After he threw a half-serious fit about losing every round, we finally surrendered the game and called it a night.

Outside, the moon hung in its third quarter—a perfect balance of light and shadow. Its pale silver glow spilled across the forest, tracing the canopy in delicate highlights while the valleys below sank into darkness. It looked serene, like the skys own lantern suspended in the vast black, steady and unhurried. The stars around it glittered brighter in the absence of its full light, together casting the night in quiet, tender beauty—half moonlight, half mystery.

With groggy goodnights, we slipped into our tents, the forest breathing softly around us.

I lay there in the dark for a while, the fabric of the tent pressing softly against me, my thoughts drifting to the two missing hikers from the poster. Their faces, frozen in photographs, mingled with the quiet sounds of the forest outside—rustling leaves, the occasional distant call of an owl.

I clutched my hatchet tightly, feeling its familiar weight against my side, a small comfort in the vast unknown around us. Slowly, the exhaustion of the day tugged at my consciousness, and I drifted off to sleep, the shadow of unease lingering just at the edge of my dreams. Hours passed, and I slept fitfully, half in dreams, half in the quiet awareness of the forest around me. Then I woke.

At first, it was just a faint rustling, almost like the wind brushing against the tent, but it carried a rhythm that didn’t belong to the trees. A pause. A shuffle. Another pause. My heart rate quickened, and I clutched my hatchet tighter, every nerve alert.

Outside, shadows shifted across the tent walls. A low, almost imperceptible snap of a twig made me freeze. I strained my ears, trying to tell if it was an animal—or something else. The forest, which had seemed peaceful and welcoming by day, now felt vast and unknowable, every sound amplified in the darkness.

I told myself it was nothing—a raccoon, a deer, maybe even my imagination—but a small, persistent chill threaded down my spine. Sleep didn’t come easily again that night, and the memory of the missing hikers haunted the edges of my mind, mingling with every creak and whisper of the forest. After wheat seemed like an eternity of sitting there, straining my senses, I herd nothing. Eventually I succumbed to exhaustion and lapsed into blissful unconsciousness.

I awoke just after sunrise and stepped out of my tent, greeted by the sight of James relieving himself onto a nearby bush.

“How’d you sleep?” he asked, craning his neck toward me, urine still streaming between his legs.

“Alright,” I replied, my body still heavy with sleep. I stretched my arms and back, muscles aching from the day before. “Did you hear anything last night?”

James shook his head. “Nothing at all,” he said, finally finishing and zipping up. Then, with his usual grin, he added, “Let’s grab some grub, then hit the trail.”

The next couple of days on the trail passed in a steady, almost meditative rhythm. Step after step, the forest unfolded around us—towering evergreens dusted with moss, ferns brushing against our legs, sunlight filtering through the canopy in shifting patterns. We walked, talked, and paused at intervals to drink and snack, letting the world slow down to the pace of our boots on the trail.

Each day we covered roughly thirty kilometres, our legs aching but our spirits buoyed by the sheer beauty around us. Streams tumbled across the path, their water crystal clear, and we often stopped to fill the water filter, then fill the bottles. Birds called from hidden perches, their songs punctuating the quiet of the forest, while distant waterfalls added a soft, constant hum to the background.

Despite the physical toll, the days felt almost peaceful, the kind of immersion that only long hikes through untouched wilderness can bring. Conversation drifted freely—jokes, memories, speculations about the trail, and plans for the nights ahead.

By the end of the third day, our progress had brought us to Elk Lake Hut. Nestled beside the still, reflective waters of the lake, the hut looked even smaller and more inviting after the long hours of walking. The lake mirrored the surrounding peaks and trees, creating a perfect, almost surreal frame around the simple wooden structure.

We dropped our packs with a collective sigh of relief, the tension of the trail momentarily slipping from our shoulders. For a moment, all that existed was the gentle lapping of the water, the croaking of frogs, the rustle of leaves in the breeze, and the quiet satisfaction of making it this far. Elk Lake Hut would be our home for the night, a small sanctuary in the heart of the wilderness before we pushed onward.

The inside it was simple, but it carried the kind of rugged charm that only backcountry shelters have. The walls were raw timber, their knots and grains catching the light like scars in old skin. In the center, a small wood-burning stove squatted on a metal plate, its surface blackened from years of use. A half-empty box of matches and a bent fire poker lay on top. Along two walls were wooden bunks, one next to the other. Each was fitted with a thin foam pad, the kind that made sleep possible but never luxurious. Carved initials, dates, and little messages were scrawled into the wood next to the beds—testaments to the people who had passed through before. *“2017 – Mike was here”* sat beside *“Cold as hell but worth it”*, and beneath that, a crudely drawn moose.

The windows were streaked with dirt and condensation, but through it you could catch the glimmer of water, still and dark under the fading light.

“Not bad, not bad,” I muttered, more to myself than to James, running my hand along the rough timber wall. “Why don’t we start a fire in the stove and have ourselves a cooked meal?”

“Sounds good to me,” James replied without hesitation, his stomach giving a dramatic growl at the mention of food. He smirked, patting his gut. “If you wanna chop up some wood, I’ll cook it up. First, though, I gotta call my girl.”

I wandered toward the treeline, scanning for dry sticks, while James ambled down toward a small dock that jutted out over the pond. The dock was old—boards gray and splintering, nailed together more with stubbornness than integrity. I watched him idly from the corner of my eye as I hacked at a branch, the sharp crack of wood splitting filling the still air. James pressed the phone to his ear and started pacing the dock, muttering something under his breath, probably waiting for a signal.

Then it happened. Without warning, one of the boards gave way with a sickening crack. His leg plunged straight through the rotten timber.

“Fuck!” James bellowed, lurching sideways. The satellite phone flew out of his grip, arcing just long enough for both of us to realize what was happening before it splashed into the dark water below.

“Shit!” I dropped the sticks and sprinted toward him, but James had already wrenched his leg free with a savage tug. Before I could tell him to leave it, he leapt straight into the pond after the phone.

The water came up to his chest, sending ripples racing across the surface. He froze for a second, sucking in a huge breath, then plunged his head and shoulders under. Bubbles foamed up where he disappeared.

“James!” I shouted, skidding to the pond’s edge, heart hammering.

Seconds later, he erupted from the water, gasping and sputtering, hair plastered to his face. In one dripping fist, he held the satellite phone triumphantly above his head like some absurd prize.

“Got it!” he croaked between coughs, water streaming from his beard and clothes.

“You good, man?” I asked, trying—and failing—to stifle the laugh bubbling up in my throat.

“Yeah, I’m good,” James grumbled, dragging himself out of the pond, boots squelching in the mud. He held the dripping satellite phone like it had personally betrayed him. “But I think this thing is fucked. Waste of three hundred bucks.”

“Let me handle dinner tonight,” I said, trying to soften the sting of his embarrassment. “I don’t have any rice to put it in, but I do have oatmeal. Maybe it’ll suffice?”

James barked out a laugh, shaking his head. “Yeah, maybe. Worth a shot.” He sloshed past me toward the hut, leaving a trail of muddy footprints. I clapped him on the back as he went, his wet clothes squishing with every step, and he gave me a sheepish grin before disappearing inside.

I turned back to the dock, hatchet still dangling loosely in my hand. That’s when I froze.

Across the pond, half-hidden in the trees, a figure was watching us.

It stood unnaturally still, its skin pale as bleached paper, like it hadn’t seen sunlight in years. From where I stood, the distance blurred its features into something unsettling—like a face you know is human but can’t quite recognize. My stomach tightened, a cold ripple running through me.

The figure then turned abruptly, vanishing into the dense treeline with a hurried shuffle.

I stood there for a long moment, the forest suddenly too quiet. The ripples on the pond smoothed into glass. Only the distant call of a raven broke the silence.

I got the fire going in the stove, the first lights of flame crackling to life before spreading into a steady warmth that filled the tiny shelter. James had stripped down and draped his wet clothes—pants, shirt, socks, and boots—across a chair beside the stove, Hopefully, it wouldn’t be long till the fabric dried. He sat slouched on one of the bunks, the battered satellite phone in his hands, poking at it with the kind of stubbornness only born from pure frustration.

“She’s going to be so pissed,” James muttered. “She probably thinks I was attacked by Bigfoot or something.”

“That’s a good way to go,” I teased, stirring a can of pork and beans on the stove until the edges bubbled. “Ripped apart by a mystical beast. Beats dying of old age.”

James snorted but didn’t look up. I poured a portion into a dented tin bowl and handed it to him. He accepted it with a grumble of thanks before digging in.

“Leave it in the oatmeal for a couple days, might do the trick,” I said, half-joking, half-serious, nodding toward the phone.

James gave me a sidelong glance. “Oatmeal resurrection, huh? Worth a shot.”

I cracked the stove door open, tossed another stick onto the fire, and listened to the wood snap and hiss. The hut was warm now, almost cozy, but my eyes kept flicking back toward the window—out into the darkening trees where the pale figure had been.

Later that night, after we’d eaten and James had finally given up on the phone, it lay in a baggy of oatmeal next to his cot. We lay in our bunks listening to the stove’s steady crackle. Sleep came slow.

Somewhere outside, a twig snapped.

My eyes snapped open. The sound was sharp, deliberate, too heavy for the usual night creatures.

For a long moment, nothing followed. Then came the rustle of underbrush, faint but deliberate, circling the hut. I held my breath, straining to hear, heart thumping so loud I swore it would wake James. A low creak groaned against the outer wall, like something brushing past the logs. I lay still in my bed, still as a corpse. Eyes glued on the window on the other side of the hut.

Then slowly, impossibly, a pale face appeared at the glass.

It wasn’t sudden—it eased into view, like someone pressing forward out of the shadows. The skin was chalk white, almost glowing against the black of the forest behind it. No hair. No eyebrows. Just large sunken eyes.

It didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

It looked unreal, like something pasted onto the night itself. My body screamed to wake James, to shout, to run, but all I could do was stare. Then, slowly, the face drifted away from the window.

And did something worse.

The door rattled. Someone—*something*—was trying to get in.

That broke me. I tore free of the sleeping bag, hatchet in one hand, flashlight in the other. My voice cracked the silence: “James! Wake up!”

James jolted upright, confused, as I charged the door like a madman. I wrenched the lock free and threw it open, the beam of my flashlight cutting through the dark. James stumbled up beside me, wearing nothing but his boxers, wielding the fire poker in one hand, lantern in the other, looking like a half-asleep caveman. “Jesus, man,” he muttered, rubbing his face. “What the *fuck* are you doing?”

“The door,” I hissed, pointing at it with the hatchet. “Someone tried to open the door. I saw—” My words faltered, my chest tightening. How could I even explain what that face looked like? It didn’t feel human.

James squinted into the trees, holding up the lantern in front of him, unimpressed. “I don’t see shit. Probably a raccoon or something.”

I didn’t answer. My grip on the flashlight trembled, the circle of light jittering across the treeline.

Then, faint—so faint I almost thought I imagined it—came the sound of *something* retreating deeper into the woods. Not the four-legged scramble of an animal. Two feet, crunching over leaves.

I didn’t sleep much the rest of the night. Every crack, every creak, every branch scratching against the hut’s walls set my nerves on edge. My eyes remained glued to the window, waiting for the visitor to return.

“Damn it!” I woke with a start. Beams of morning light were bleeding in through the windows. James sat on his bed, satellite phone in hand, frown etched across his face.

“Come on, you piece of shit, work!” he muttered, glancing in my direction.

“Oh… morning,” he added distractedly, not noticing my tension. “Sleep okay?”

I tried, and failed, to shake the last vestiges of sleep from my head. “Not really,” I admitted, rubbing my eyes.

I nodded toward the satellite phone. “Still not working, huh?”

“Nope. Might need to be put more in the oatmeal,” he muttered, glancing up at me with a hard look. “We… going to talk about last night?”

Heat rose to my face. Embarrassment hit hard, but I knew I couldn’t let it slide. If I stayed quiet, I’d look like a lunatic.

“Look, man,” I said with a heavy sigh, running a hand through my hair, something I did when stressed, “I’m not crazy. I saw something.”

James stared at me skeptically, eyes locked on mine, searching for any sign that this was some elaborate prank at his expense. After a long beat, he nodded. “Okay… so what was it you saw?”

I hesitated; grateful he was at least listening. “Not exactly sure,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “But it was… skinny. Pale.”

James cracked a wicked grin. “Very original.”

“I’m serious, dude,” I snapped, irritation starting to flare.

James wiggled his fingers at me and pulled a ridiculous face. “It was Slenderman, huh?”

I threw my hands in the air. “I know how crazy it sounds—I’m not making this shit up.”

James put a finger to his ear, mimicking a microphone, and in a mock-reporter voice said, “This just in: local hikers found fucked to death by cliché monster.”

I groaned, running a hand over my face. “You *do* realize this isn’t funny, right?”

James shrugged,

 “I’m serious, James. I saw it. It was *there*.”

James leaned back against the bunk, still smirking, but the humor in his eyes faltered slightly.

I just roll my eyes, “whatever dude, lets just get going” and began gathering up my belongings.

The next couple of kilometers were slow and exhausting. Not only was I sleep-deprived, but every few feet I found myself glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting to see that pale figure lurking behind the trees. Each time, there was nothing—just the swaying of branches and the occasional rustle of unseen wildlife.

By the time the sun was beginning to tilt toward the horizon, around 5 p.m., we were still eight or nine kilometers shy of the next hut. My muscles ached, my pack felt heavier than ever, and yet a small sense of relief began to creep in.

Maybe I hadn’t seen anything at all. Maybe last night had been a trick of shadows and fatigue. For the first time all day, I allowed myself to relax, telling myself this

It felt like just another uneventful stretch of the trail. We set up camp and made do with a simple dinner of protein bars and ketchup chips. Later, we played cards under the weak glow of the lantern. James gloated with every win, his laughter echoing faintly in the stillness, but my mind was elsewhere.

As the shadows stretched long and thick around our small campsite, a creeping unease settled over me. The forest, which had seemed quiet and familiar all day, now felt alive with unseen eyes. Every rustle of leaves, every snap of a twig, sent a shiver crawling up my spine. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched.

“Are you going to be okay?” James asked, genuine concern flickering across his face.

“Yeah… yeah, I think so,” I replied, though the tremor in my voice betrayed my unease.

“Well… I’m hitting the hay. If you get eaten alive by this monster, try not to scream too loud—I don’t want my beauty sleep interrupted,” he joked, lightly jabbing me in the arm.

I forced a weak smile, but my eyes drifted to the dark forest surrounding us. The shadows seemed alive, the trees shifting just enough to suggest movement. It felt like the eyes were everywhere, watching my every move, waiting for a moment of weakness to strike. My guard felt impossibly thin, and the night stretched out ahead like a living thing. I slipped into my sleeping bag, trying to convince myself I was just being paranoid. The forest outside seemed impossibly still, but every so often a branch would crack, a leaf would scrape against another, and my pulse would spike. James’ even breathing soon reminded me that he had already dozed off. I envied him, or at least the illusion of peace he seemed to have. I tried to close my eyes, to block out the feeling of eyes pressing in from the darkness.

A few sleepless hours later, the urge to piss became impossible to ignore. I tried to push it down, telling myself to wait, not wanting to step outside into the dark, watching woods. But it was a losing battle.

I muttered a curse under my breath and quietly unzipped my tent flap. Heart thudding, I peeked out, sweeping the flashlight beam across the forest. Shadows stretched and twisted, but nothing moved.

The waning gibbous moon sagged in the sky like a bruised eye, its swollen face leaking pale light across the forest. The glow wasn’t comforting—it was sickly, strained, as though the moon itself were wasting away. Shadows stretched long and crooked under its watch, twisting the trees into warped silhouettes. Every patch of silver light felt like exposure, like being dragged under its gaze, while the darkness between seemed to crawl closer, eager to swallow what the moon abandoned.

Slowly, I stepped out of the safety of my tent, every nerve on edge, and moved to relieve myself, ears straining for the slightest sound. The forest felt impossibly still, yet every instinct screamed that I wasn’t truly alone. After I finished, I turned to head back to my tent—and froze. The beam of my flashlight caught it, partially hidden behind a tree. Its bald, egg-shaped head tilted slightly, pale and wide eyed, staring straight at me.

“Fuck!” I shouted, the flashlight shaking in my hands. My grip tightened around the hatchet, every muscle coiled, ready to charge if it stepped closer. The forest seemed to hold its breath, the usual night sounds fading into an unnatural silence.

I could feel my pulse hammering in my ears, each heartbeat a deafening drum. The figure didn’t move—just watched, impossibly still, as if assessing whether I was a threat.

Then, a bony hand emerged from behind the tree, followed by a weak, quivering voice: “Please… I’m lost.”

If I hadn’t just peed, I probably would have soiled myself right then.

By now, James was emerging from his tent, lantern in hand, rubbing sleep from his eyes. His gaze fell on the figure, and he staggered back in terror. “Fucking hell!” he screamed. “What the fuck is that?”

“Please don’t hurt me,” the creature said, its voice fragile. “I haven’t seen another person in so long… please. I mean you no harm.”

My pulse still racing, I forced myself to take a step forward. Summoning every ounce of courage, I shouted, “Come out where we can see you!”

Ever so slowly, it emerged from behind the tree, pale features fully revealed, its movements deliberate and cautious. It looked like a walking skeleton, skin stretched taut over bone, caked in dirt and mud. Its body was completely hairless—no hair on its head, face, or body, not even eyebrows. like Cormac McCarthy’s infamous character, the Judge, if he was liberated from Auschwitz.

I noticed, uncomfortably, that it had no clothes, leaving its thin, frail form fully exposed. The sight made my stomach churn, but I forced myself to focus, trying to understand whether it truly meant any harm. “Who… who are you?” I asked, voice steadier than I felt.

It gestured to itself, long, bony fingers curling awkwardly, and rasped. “My name… is David Varg,”
