  Ok, so for some context with the entity that I had an experience with: The Haunting. The Haunting is a ghost/spirit type creature that comes from an ancient folklore, people don't tend to believe folklore, but I can tell you this creature is very much real, as it nearly took my life. Anyway, I'm getting off track. The Haunting is a ghost/spirit creature that comes after people who desecrate graves of those who were of importance. If anyone in a group destroys said important graves, even if the others in their group did not, the Haunting will stop at nothing until everyone is dead. The Haunting also has the power to possess people, and become a physical being. The key way to figure out if someone is being possessed by The Haunting is if the person in question is rotting alive. This is because, based off of my research, The haunting is super radioactive. 

  My story began when my 2 friends; Zach, Brad, my brother Atles, and I (I would like to remain anonymous) were hiking through the woods on a Friday evening. We had been about 6 hours away from the car at the time, and we were hiking up a hill that the locals had titled, "Mount Haunting."
After hiking about four and a half miles Brad said that we should set up camp.

  After setting up camp we started drinking some beer and smoking pot. Later, while all of us were high and drunk, Atlas (being the most intoxicated) admitted to desecrating some graves earlier that day along the trail. We all scolded him for being so foolish and disrespectful to the dead when we suddenly heard a defeaning crunch coming from deep within the forest. 

  We all, except Atles, rushed into our tent. Atlas was sitting by the fire muttering and chattering to himself, when we suddenly saw a humanoid shadow casted onto the tent wall, walking slowly over to were atles was. Atlas was completely unaware of what was going on, and what happened next still chills me to my core to this day. The shadow man made his way to Atles where he extended a massive claw, about a foot long, and ripped Atles' head clean off. We all went fanatic, and booked it to the car and drove off, not stopping untill we made it well out of town.

  After a completely silent car ride, We eventually made it to a nearby police station. Brad and I turned around to ask if Zach was all good, only to find him rotting alive. Brad immediately booked it for the station, and I was soon behind him. When we made it into the station we frantically explained all that had happened to us to the only officer who was there at the time. Unfortunately, he didn't believe a word we said, and he started laughing and told us we needed to lay off the crack.

  As Brad and I stood there bewildered at his response, Zach broke into the building through the brick wall nearest the front door. The officer immediately started shooting at him, but his bullets did little to slow down the possessed Zach, and he went over to the officer where he ripped his head clean off.

  It has been about two weeks, Brad and I have been on the road non-stop since that night. We haven't told many people, mostly because nobody believes us, but I write this here because as far as I know there may be similar stories to this one on this site. I want this story to remain here, because frankly, we don't have too much longer and I would like others to know of our unfortunate circumstance, in the hope you avoid the same fate as I.
