Growing up and apart is a difficult thing. From pre-teen adolescence through college, it feels as if nothing could untangle the intertwined threads of our four lives. 

But, inevitably, reality made itself known when careers, love and adult life in general scattered us across the country. Mikaela moved out west to be with her girlfriend, Val ended up returning to her deep south roots, and Lucas upped sticks to the big city to take up his dream job. 

And that left me the sole remnant in our small college town, with a disquieting confusion about my plans for the future and the memories of days and years gone by still fresh in my mind. Eventually, though, as we tend to do, I sorted myself out. I never did leave our college town, but a good job and a fledgling relationship left me satisfied enough with life. 

It had been seven months and change since we'd all seen one another, and we decided to finally stop putting it off in the name of more pressing engagements and go on our annual weekend cabin trip. It had become a staple of our college years, but naturally was more of a logistical challenge once we had to fight against geography. There was a particular cabin we always rented out - nestled at the base of rolling green hills and poking out of thick forestry with a small lake nearby. It took a few too many hours to drive there, but that cabin became our favourite place in the world. 

Given our varied starting points, we made our separate ways there. I arrived as the sun dipped below the horizon on Friday - the first day of our stay - and was welcomed by a giddy Mikaela who had been sitting on the porch with a flickering cigarette between her fingers in one hand whilst the other fidgeted with a hair-tie. 

"*Bellaaaa, it's been insanely long - I've missed you!*" she exclaimed with a toothy grin plastered across her face. I broke into a half-run before wrapping my arms around her in a warm embrace. I had missed her, too. 

"*Early birds, eh?*" I said as I glanced over to our parked cars.

"*More like the earliest of the late*", she teased. 

She led me through the large wooden front door and into the cabin, and I told her I'd be freshening up in my bedroom. At some point after my shower, I must have dozed off because the sound of our final arrivals startled me out of an unwitting slumber, with two hours apparently having passed. Val and Lucas' chatter was loud enough to be heard from my bedroom, and Mikaela's laughter could probably be heard across the world. There was another voice in there, though, one I couldn't quite recognise despite a gnawing sense of familiarity. I supposed that either Val or Lucas had brought a friend along. Annoying, given my predisposition to a tinge of social anxiety, but nothing I hadn’t dealt with before. 

I made my way down the winding oak stairs and into the living room, where the friends I had so dearly ached to see were waiting with wide smiles and celebratory drinks already in tow. A round of tight hugs and cheek kisses later, and we were all set for a long night of catching up - but I was raised in a well-mannered household and insisted on being introduced to the plus one somebody had clearly brought along. She was the first thing I noticed as I turned into the living room, and I had assumed an introduction would be made after I had greeted those in attendance whom I already knew. 

Apparently, nobody else thought so. 

She was a slightly older woman, perhaps in her early 30s, of quite some height and with long brown hair flowing just beyond her waist, dressed in clothing of a lady from generations gone by. Vintage stuff was “in” these days, so I tried not to be judgmental. Besides, she looked nice enough. We had exchanged brief eye contact as I embraced Val, but no words were spoken, and no gesture of potential friendship was extended. 

“*Fine, I’ll do it myself*”, I thought. 

“*Hi, I’m Bella. Nice to meet ya,*” I mumbled with a faux air of confidence and an outstretched arm. 

The woman stood there, silent and offering nothing in return save for a harsh glare. 

“*Um, you good?*” Mikaela said. 

“*Looks like someone’s drank enough already*”, Lucas joked.

My quiet displeasure with the situation grew into a nascent concern. 

“*Just being polite*”, I said, my tone indicating irritation. 

“*You were just talking to the literal air, girl*”, Val chimed in.

And sure enough, they seemed to be right. I scanned the room in disbelief and found no trace of the very real woman who had stood before me moments prior. 

That turned me into the object of a good few jokes early on in the night, but they failed to cut through the growing unease bubbling beneath my skin. I’d never experienced a hallucination in my life, and even then, she had just seemed too tangible. Too real. 

With the help of reminiscent laughs and a good deal of alcohol, the incident was gradually washed away from the top of our minds, and the board gaming was now in full swing. We had gotten through a few rounds of Monopoly, the mandatory round of Guess Who and eventually moved on to good old Uno. I was always the lucky one at Uno, and that streak didn’t look like it was coming to an end - as I so gracefully gloated at the end of another victory - when Lucas declared we would play one last round before moving on. We handed our cards back in, and he shuffled them once more before dishing them out in a neat circle. I suppose we were all drunk at that point because it took Lucas placing an extra set of cards in the circle for him to realise who he had given that set to. 

“*Uh, guys, I think someone really did bring a friend along*”, he said with a slight slur. 

Given his personality, we took it as a joke at first. 

“*Duuuude, get over it already!*” I loudly spoke.

“*I’m not joking, Bella, cut it out*”, he said in reply. 

“*What’s she look like then?*” I asked. 

His answer sobered me up fast. 

“*Like you, but 10 or something years older*”.

She had, in fact, looked a little like me, only a decade or so older. Lucas was seeing the same woman I saw earlier. 

The look on my face conveyed enough for even my drunk companions to begin connecting the dots. I wasn’t one for curiosity about these things, and I wasn’t one to be the cliched first death in a horror film. Lucas’ affirmation of the woman I saw was enough for me to tell everybody I was getting out of there, and the protestations of my friends did little to change my mind. I proposed renting a different place out in the morning, and said I’d be heading to the nearest motel in the meantime. I wasn’t about to spend the night in the now apparently phantom-inhabited cabin. 

The resistance to my hasty decision continued as I tossed the little I had unpacked back into my duffel bag, but when I’m convinced of something, nothing can change my mind. A force of habit that likely does just as much harm as good, but a force nonetheless. I said goodnight to my now ticked-off group of friends and twisted the front doorknob whilst I fumbled with my car keys in my pocket and stepped out into the cool breeze of the midsummer’s night.

Well, I took *one* step out. 

The other, inexplicably, led me right back into the cabin I just left. I found myself standing with the hallway and stairs in my eyeline, and my friends shooting daggers of confusion at me. The door was closed behind me as if it had never been opened, and my feet were firmly planted on the “Welcome Home!” rug lying across the wooden floor.

“*Missed us already, eh?*” Mikaela said with her arms exaggeratedly crossed. Thoughts of confusion swirled across my mind, and all I could muster in response was a slack-jawed expression of unbelievability. The moment I had taken that second step out, it was as if I simply ceased to exist anywhere besides that damned rug. I didn't remember turning back into the open doorway, nor did I remember stepping through it. 

Without speaking a word, I tried again. And again. As did Mikaela, Val and Lucas. Looking on from inside the cabin, all seemed normal. One, or on a few occasions two, of us would open the door and plant one foot ahead of the other before closing the door and presumably voyaging into the night. A minute or so would pass before whoever had left would appear at the front door once again and allow themselves in. We spent most of that first night, in amongst cowering in fear at the growing number of appearances of the uninvited lady, trying to game the apparent system. Hopping and jumping out instead of taking two distinct steps, trying to force the door to remain open, attempting to open it back up and eventually barricading it when it slammed shut of its own accord in hopes of allowing at least one of us to escape, and finally settling for watching from the living room windows after failure in all of our other futile schemes. 

The watching was the most terrifying of these impossible happenings. The windows faced the drive and were large enough to see most of the front exterior of the cabin - but not large enough to peer across onto the front porch. We would watch as whoever left the cabin walked along to the top of the dirt road leading back to civilisation and out of view. The second any poking visual remnant of their presence had disappeared, they would show up, having opened the door and walked inside as if nothing had happened, in the cabin again. The aforementioned barricading didn't do much to allow anybody's escape either - the door opened and closed of its own angry volition. There was no calling for help given the patchy-at-the- best-of-times service out there, and the nearest neighbours were miles away. Our peaceful isolation had become anything but.

That first night, after allowing us to fully grasp the reality of our situation, the lady began planting the seeds of her infectious evil. It started with Lucas. His bloodshot eyes brimmed with terror as they fixed on a point outside the huddle of faux-comfort we gathered ourselves in. Having realised there wasn't a thing we could do to escape whatever she was, we remained in place alongside him as he listened to what she told him. 

"*You'll starve to death in here*".

"*Your friends will turn on you*".

"*Better to eat than be eaten*."

Lucas was the focus of her efforts for that first night, but we stayed strong. If anything, we were more terrified of our entrapment than we were of the lady. But she was right. We had enough food for the weekend and a day or so more at best. Even rationing wouldn't do much good with the nutritionally deficient vacation food we brought along. We *would* starve. 

And her reminders of this spread to us all, growing ever violent in the scenarios they depicted. Foiled escape attempt after foiled escape attempt led to a silent agreement for us to accept our situation by the end of the weekend. Hunger made itself known by Monday, and the now infuriating whispers of the lady began to combine with our grumbling bellies. 

For reasons unknown, she keyed in on Lucas. By this point, we had overstayed our original weekend by at least two days and time itself was beginning to lose meaning in amongst the maddening impossibility of what was happening to us. Whether it was the reality of the situation or some parasitic ability of the lady's whispers that broke him, he eventually broke. 

We all slept in one room - the room I'd first chosen for myself at the beginning of our ordeal - because it gave us a false sense of safety. Really, we knew there was nothing we could do, but it was easier to face the evil we had become sitting ducks for together. Sunlight was beginning to stream through small gaps in the curtain, disturbing the slumber we had all unwillingly slipped into and welcoming us into another day of famished imprisonment. My eyes had barely opened when I first witnessed the scene before me. Lucas was sitting alone in the far corner, busily sinking his blood-stained teeth into the fleshiness of a mystery meat. Beside him lay a pink hair-tie, a glinting knife and a clump of dirty blonde hair. Mikaela. 

He had given in to everything we swore we would never give in to. 

The instinctual screams I let out were enough to awaken Val, who, fortunately enough chose the flight option as opposed to freezing up like I had, and she grabbed hold of my arm before putting as much distance between us and the bedroom as possible. 

I'd like to say that sight was the worst of it, but what made matters so much worse was the fact that Lucas didn't care for us. He had become consumed by the hunger, and in that moment, was ridding himself of it.

Like a predator picking off more vulnerable animals in a pack, he would get to us soon enough. 

Neither Val nor I saw the lady after she had nestled herself deep within Lucas' mind. She had supposedly been looking for a vessel amongst us, and now she had one. 

Through the early stages of starvation and rapidly worsening, literal cabin-fever, Val and I gathered our remaining scraps of food and supplies before barricading ourselves inside the furthest room from the bedroom of that awful incident. And we prayed. Despite neither of us holding an ounce of religiosity nor faith within us, we prayed. To whatever we could, whatever might have even the tiniest chance of being real enough to listen to us.

Nothing listened to us fast enough. Val died of hunger an unknowable amount of time after Mikaela's death, whilst I held her in my weak arms in the bedroom I accepted would become my final resting place too. I stopped praying for rescue and settled for wishing the hunger would take me too before whatever Lucas became felt hungry again. 

Perhaps I shouldn't have settled. Whatever evil inhabited that cabin broke us all in different ways. Lucas through madness, Mikaela through murder, Val through starvation, and me?

The worst had been saved for me. 

After witnessing the friends I loved so dearly meeting their various, terrifying fates, and after being reduced to so little, I begged for the mercy of a horrible death in hopes of washing these awful memories away, I was granted my release. 

The wailing of sirens rang out through the cabin, and the strobing blue lights of police cars pulling into the drive filtered through the windows. Memory fails me beyond this point - I had apparently attempted to crawl to the bedroom door and call out for help, but collapsed not far from where I started. From where Val's frail body still lay. 

They found whatever Lucas had become still feasting on the dwindling remnants of Mikaela's rotting body. I suppose the hunger would have won the race to relieve my soul of its mortal weight before he did. I still wish he had. He had charged at the first responders as soon as they forced entry, and they riddled him with bullets. 

Despite my protestations to the contrary and despite Lucas' body disappearing from the morgue it had been taken to, the official story remains that he orchestrated it all. That he set us up to be the lambs to his slaughter. 

But I know better.
