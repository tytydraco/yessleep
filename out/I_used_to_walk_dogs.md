My name is Wyatt and I need to get this out. A few years back I got a job advertisement. 



“Animal care assistant no experience required” 

Being fresh out of college with minimal job prospects I thought this would be a perfect chance. Ever since I was a kid I cared for animals. Cooper our golden retriever was my best friend. We got him when I was nine for the next decade we were practically inseparable. However, when I was getting ready to go the college Cooper was diagnosed with Hemangiosarcoma a very common dog cancer. I was heartbroken and I refused to let him go alone. When they put him to sleep I refused to leave him alone. I practically had to grapple with my dad to not make me leave him. But I stayed I looked him in the eyes as the vet gave him the sedative to help him stop squirming as they put him down. I kept his ashes in a little locket which I pinned to my backpack all through college. It felt as if he was there dutifully walking beside me through the labors of academia. But when I saw the ad I put in the application and got a call. A gruff man’s voice asked. 



“Is this Mr.Kelly” 



“Yes” I responded. 



“Tomorrow 3 pm I’ve emailed you the address of the shelter we want you to get to know the rest of the staff before you start ” the voice curtly ordered 



Before I could respond the voice hung up. 



So I guess this guy was to be my boss. The next day I took the bus to the big concrete building at the edge of town. 



Saint Francis Shelter 



I thought that name was kinda weird. Don’t they usually name hospitals after saints? I pulled my bag up on my shoulders hearing the charm with Cooper in it jingle. I took a deep breath and opened the doors to the shelter. A thin woman behind the desk in the spacious lobby stood from her chair and greeted me.



“Hello there welcome to Saint Francis can I ask what brings you in today” The woman who based on her name tag was named Margret 



“Oh hi my name is Wyatt a man called me yesterday to ask me to come in for the new position,” I said but before I could continue the woman cut me off. 



“Oh yeah the major is in the locker room but I’ll give you a tour of the facility” Margret cheerily said 



“Major?” I asked



“The major he’s one of the people who manage the facility most of the staff are veterans,” Margret said 

  


After leading me through a bunch of rooms and corridors of white-painted concrete. Then we entered the kennel. Rows and rows of cages some of them stacked on top of each other. It looked like one of those commercials you’d see they looked at me so sadly. And that’s when I finally crystallized the main question I had.



There are no other animals just dogs.



Usually, animal shelters have a mix of animals but this was just dogs. 



But I walked past the kennel and that’s when I noticed another odd thing.



The dogs were all big. No Shit Tzus or pugs the smallest thing I saw was some big pit mix. And they all looked like rescues. Most of them had scars bruises ripped ears a few were missing eyes. They all looked right out of one of those commercials where you see all the sad animals and then the shelter begs you for money.



“The Major likes to take in dogs that have the least chance of adoption we try to make them healthy and comfortable even if they don’t have anywhere to go,” Margret  said as she seemed to notice my confusion. 



“My guess he just sees himself in them” she continued as she opened the other steel door at the end of the kennel. 



That led to a T-shaped split in the hallway at one end was a set of wooden double doors and on the other end was a locked up metal door it looked more like a bank vault door with heavy metal locks and a swipe card slot. 



“That’s the secure section it’s where we keep paperwork and records,” Margret said as she led me to the big set of doors. 



I looked up at the plack on the door and it read.



Quiet room please be respectful.l 



I suddenly was taken back to a similar sign I saw in the vet where I said goodbye to my best friend.



As we began to open the doors I heard a loud click and slam as the secure section door slammed shut.



“Hey Marge  this the new guy” a voice from behind exclaimed 



I turned around to be met with a man a few years older than me maybe twenty-eight.



“Hi my name’s Wyatt who are you,” I asked reaching out my hand.



“I'm Will” Will said as he walked up and shook my hand. 



“Hey Will let's talk later time to go bring Wyatt to meet the Major,” Margret said as she gently began leading me back down the hall back to the kennel. 



Margaret led me back through the kennel to the lobby where a tall bald muscular man maybe in his fifties stood leaning against the counter. Once he turned to face me and I got a better look at him I noticed something odd. He was covered in scars cuts across his face and burn marks on his arm. I tried my best not to stare but it was grisly, to say the least. 



“Hello young man my name is David Marster but most people call me Major,” The Major said as he looked me up and down.



“Yes sir my name is--” the major cut me off. 



“Wyatt,” The Major said as he picked up a clipboard and a pen.



“Sir may I ask what my responsibilities would be if I worked here” I asked 



“Well Wyatt youll be our new dog walker,” the Major said as he pushed me the clipboard and pen.



I looked the paper up and down it was a employee contract. At the bottom, there was a spot for me to sign. With a quick flick of a wrist, I sold my soul.



The major filled me in on my job with just how many dogs they have here they need someone to take them out daily so I'd take the dogs in groups of two to four and walk around town. Specifically, the major requested I take the old and sick dogs into the woods behind the shelter and walk them around the lake so they can get a last moment of glory before being put to sleep. It was so odd the dogs always pulled and tugged as I walked them. 



There was this big mean looking Pitt named Gauge who would always seem to stop and look at this same building every time. An old-style blue house not far from the shelter. He didn't even run or try to run he would just sit and stare up at the house his pure massive body weight slowing me down as I pulled and eventually after coaxing he would eventually get up and with a little less pep in his step would walk along with me. A lot of the dogs had odd behaviors like that they'd randomly stop and stare at places, and people it was weird. It wasn't like they suddenly wanted to run off. But if I knew if I had that great Dane Gary and we’d walk past the restaurant downtown he would stop plant himself and not move until I practically dragged him to his feet. 



The first odd experience I had was one time I finished my last rounds took the dogs back to their cages and began locking them up. As I was finishing lockup I heard the squeal of rubber in the parking lot. I put the last of my group a German shepherd named Harvey and walked out to the lobby to see what was going on. A group of about six big pickup trucks pulled into the parking lot not seeming to care about the lines painted on the asphalt. Out of the trucks came about a dozen tall burly men dressed in all black. Most of them were in what looked like surplus clothes and they all carried heavy duffelbags slung over their shoulder. The major walked past me and went to greet the men. Before he walked out the door I asked.



“Who are those guys” 



“Night shift.” the major calmly responded as he went out to greet them.



The night shift guys were odd. They spoke very little and the minimum they did say would mostly consist of them telling you to get out of their way. They only seemed to have any friendly conversation with each other and the major. 



That was another odd thing I picked up on. Did the major live here? He never seemed to leave. I'd come in for work at nine in the morning and he'd already be here. Then when I'd be getting ready to go at five and the night shift staff was coming in he would stay with them. I never once saw him outside of the shelter. Maybe he was just incredibly dedicated that's at least what I thought then. 



One time I asked the major “Why do you have so much more staff at night than during the day”

“The dogs can be more easily spooked at night it's good to have some more people there” The Major curtly responded 



But that was my life keep your eyes down do what the major said walk the dogs. Get paid. The pay was pretty good in all honesty.



Looking back on it of experiences I should have probably paid more attention to. 



One time I was walking Gauge the pit when we passed the house. He as per usual stopped sat and didn't wanna move. 



“Oh come on gauge not this again” I pleaded as I pulled on his leash.



That's when the door opened. 



A woman about my age walked out the front door tapping on her phone. That's when Gauge went ballistic. He didn't bark but he pulled and pulled like he wanted to get closer to her. She looked up from her phone and saw me feebly pulling on his lead trying to get him to go further down the street. 



“Oh who's this,” she said as she walked over to pet Gauge.



“This is Gauge sorry about him he must like you,” I said as Gauge nuzzled her hand and sniffed her.



“Oh it's no issue,” she said as she scratched behind Gauge's ears to his delight.



“I'm sorry my name is Wyatt,” I said as I attempted to reach out a hand as all the dogs pulled in different directions. 



“Sandra,” she said as she managed to shake my struggling hand.



“WellIi better get back to work sorry about him again,” I said as I began to walk off.



Gauge was not having any of this. He did not want to go. He started yowling and barking like someone was trying to kill him. As Sandra walked away he eventually caved and followed me.



I stopped and kneeled to him.



“Hey buddy look we will try to stop here again if she is here but I need you to work with me can you do that big guy” I said as I rubbed behind his ears.



As we were walking away I swear i heard something from behind me. Like someone whispering into the wind as it passed by your ear.



“Tha…..nk……..you” 



I looked back but all I saw was Gauge staring at me as he slowly trotted along. 



I had just finished my a of walks and I was putting the dogs back in their cages. When I heard a shout from down the hall like a panicked scream. I ran in case someone was hurt but it was so bizarre I didn't recognize the voice anywhere.



“Please no please please don't hurt me” the voice pleaded before seemingly morphing into a sound that sounded like one part begging and one part whining. 



I went into the split and it was coming from the quiet room. I walked up and tried the handle but it was locked. A few more moments of grunting and moaning before Will and the major pushed out of the room and Will held a bloody rag over his arm.



“Will did you get bit” the major barked at him



“No he just scratched me” Will pleaded.



I looked past them to see the unmoving body of a German shepherd hunter laying his eyes pointed towards the door seemingly looking at me.



“Will don't fucking lie to me did you get bit?” The major said as he slammed Will against the wall 



Will looked down away from the major wordlessly the major grabbed him and led him towards the security door. As I walked behind them my mind swam with questions. First of which was.



Who was that?



It wasn't Will or the major the voice sounded weak and pathetic as if it was groveling. 



“Sir what's going on should I get first aid-----” I went to ask before I was sharply cut off by the major.



“Wyatt stay back will might be sick” The Major ordered



“Ok sir should I dial nine one one,” I asked as I took a step back. 



“NO just wait here,” The major said as he pushed Will through the security door. 



I looked past them to see into the secure room. That's the thing though there wasn't a room it was just a stairwell. Leading down Will flew forward tripping over himself and falling at the top of the stairs. The major looked at me with a paternal demand and then threw the heavy security door shut with an unexpected strength. I stood there frozen. I didn't know what to do. I slowly backed away from the door and went back to the kennel. As soon as I opened the doors the dog all looked at me. It was bizarre it was as if they were privy to something I wasn't. The usual barks and huffs I'd hear expecting walks or treats or anything they just stood and followed me with their gaze as I walked down the hall. As I opened the door to walk out to the lobby I heard something behind me.



“H…he…..help ……. Us” The voice sounded wrong as if it were coming out of a misshaped voice box



I spun around to see who had spoken but when I looked back it was just the procession of canines. I quickly pulled open the door and stepped out to the lobby. Margaret was sat at the desk and looked up at me worried.



“What happened” She asked



“Will got bit,” I said stammering. 



She just looked down with this grim look on her face as if I just told her he died. 



“Yeah it's crazy the major freaked out about it and took him into the secure room” I continued wiping the sweat from my forehead.



She looked at me and cocked her head confused as if getting ready to explain a joke to me. Suddenly her eyes went wide and she looked away from me.



“Yeah the major takes running this place very seriously,” she said trying to stifle some emotion. 



Suddenly the door flew open and the major walked into the lobby. He had some cuts and bruises like he had just gotten into a scuffle. 



“You alright boss,” Margret said as she grabbed the first aid kit from under the desk. 



He waved his hand as if to say he was o.k 



The next day I came in and where it would normally be just Margret waiting for me the major was standing there at the desk. As soon as I stepped through the door he started. 



“Will is sick and probably gonna be out for a while,” The Major said as he headed for the door. 



Will never come back. At least not in the way he was expecting. 



A week later I arrived and one of the night shift trucks was parked out front. The major and the night shift guys were pulling cages from the bed of the truck and loading them inside. 



“Oh, Wyatt you're here grab a crate if you need one of the guys to help don't be afraid to ask.” the major said as he pulled a cage with a husky in it off of the truck.



I managed to struggle and pull a cage with a black lab inside it. I looked at the collar as I picked up the cage.



“Willy” 



The dog made eye contact with me which was also something odd about the dogs. They always made eye contact with me. I looked it up one time and apparently, dogs make eye contact with people they trust so I guess I must be on their good side. But when Willy looked at me he seemed to calm. Before he was scared shaking like a leaf. But he slowed down and eventually calmed down. Made carrying his cage a lot easier. After a few hours of loading and intake such as making sure all of the dogs had their shots and checking for any tracking chips, I was left alone in the kennel room. 



Suddenly as I was getting ready to walk out the door I heard a moaning and groaning noise. Like one of the dogs was in pain. I ran across the room to see what was happening and Willy was rolling around as if he was in agony. The other dogs were all barking and screaming and howling in a mix of fear and reverence. A canine chorus of demons heralding their fanged king. He writhed making horrible howling and groaning noises. I went to run to get help but I heard a voice shout.



“NO” the voice scream-howled at me.



I ran back to see Willy had begun to change as if his muscles were moving under his skin. His bones snapped and his joints dislocated. He slowly began to shift to a shape more like that of a man. The dog's teeth seemed to retract into his head sliding under his skin like some kind of parasite. Human hands pushed through the front paws as the paw pads slid under his fingernails. The same happened as his legs violently snapped into a straight shape like a human leg. His ears slid down his head and retracted into his head like someone pulling a sock into his head. The horrible breaking sloughing and groaning froze me against the wall. After what felt like hours he sat on the floor of the cage. 



Sweating 



Panting 



Bruised and beaten



It was Will.



I stood there in shock and confusion.



“Wyatt…. You need to run…...” He panted as he reached out to grab the doors.



I wasn't gonna leave him behind. I grabbed the keys and began trying to find the one for this cage. Will slammed his hand on the door rattling it.



“GET OUT OF HERE WYATT” he barked at me.



“The Major can't see you know”



Just then the door swung open and the major and one of the night shift guys carrying a rifle entered. I don't know much about guns but it looked like a military-style rifle. The kind you'd see a bad guy in an action movie use. Before I could say a word the gun was pointed at me. My hands shot up and I began slowly backing away. 



“Did he bite you?” the major asked calmly.



“No,” I said backing up against the door behind me.



The major drew a taser and shot Will he screamed and shouted in pain. As I looked over at him the man with the rifle swung the stock of it hitting me in the head. My memory gets a little foggy from here. I fell backward through the door and slammed my head against the concrete wall before hitting the ground. I heard the major yelling at the man and then stepping over me. I remember them grabbing my legs and dragging me towards the security door and that’s when I blacked out.



I woke up my head was pounding I was cold and I felt my skin touching something metal. I was bruised and I was handcuffed behind my arms and chained to a chair with heavy iron chains. I opened my eyes and I saw a dark wide open room. I went to scream but I had a muzzle belted over my mouth. I realized the cold feeling I felt I was nude sitting in a metal chair. I panicked looking around and saw another chair across from me.  Will was tied to another chair with a similar setup. I looked around there were two cages in the room one on each end. Suddenly a door swung open and the major stood in the doorway. I saw several figures watching through a large bulletproof window next to the door. 



“I like you Wyatt you’re hardworking bright and most importantly obedient,” the major said as he stepped into the room. 



“I think you have some serious upward mobility in this industry,” he said as he continued walking towards me.



“And we inspected you for bites seems you were telling the truth but I feel like you need a demonstration just so you can understand exactly what we do here.” He said as he drew a pistol from a holster on his belt



I tried to scream and beg but I couldn’t make a sound. He pointed the pistol at me for a moment.



Before suddenly turning the gun and shot Will 3 times in the chest. He groaned in pain as the bullets ripped into his flesh. But in a moment of inhuman horror, he began howling and screaming as the hot metal lodged in his chest slowly pushed backward and fell out of his flesh and into his lap. 



“You understand Wyatt that men need to manage the dogs,” the major said as he stowed the pistol and drew a large knife. 



“Sixty percent that seems to be the magic number,” the major said as he examined the knife.



In one quick fluid motion, he slashed Will’s throat. It was like a hot knife through butter. Will gargled in pain as the new hole in his neck bubbled with his screaming spurting blood out and all over the floor. The blood seemed to pour out his neck like crimson rainfall. He attempted to scream but all that was heard was a wet spray as his supernatural flesh folded and flapped. 



The major turned around and wiped the knife with a rag. He threw the rag to the side and slid the knife back into the sheathe on his belt. 



“Look Wyatt you need to understand how serious this is these animals are dangerous,” the major said as he walked over and kneeled before me. 



“But a man needs to make money,” he said 



“Sometimes people will pay good money to see these dogs show their strength,” he said as I looked at the dried blood all over the floor.



“Regular dogfighting isn't interesting anymore but when we discovered these things suddenly clients were far more willing to bet and pay to watch,” he said as he looked around the room.



“Unfortunately Will was not a planned candidate usually we just find people who get infected and put them to work.” the major said as he looked over at Will's body.y 



I looked past the major and saw Wills's body. His flesh was rapidly breaking down but under his skin was not just his regular shape. As his flesh began to melt the bones and claws and teeth of his dog's body began to leak out. Bloody fleshy paw pads fell on the ground his face sloughed off as the bones of his canine jaw and his human skull fused as he slumped down. 



 The major pulled off the muzzle and began to uncuff me and started to unwrap the chains holding me down. Part of me went to run part of me just stayed still the second part won and I just slumped limply. The door swung open and one of the night-shift guys asked.



“He all good?” 



“Yeah get him his clothes” the major ordered the man in the doorway.



“Hey Wyatt take a few days off and then we can talk about your new position in the company,” the major said as he patted his hand on my shoulder before he walked away.



I sat there staring at the pile of bones goo blood, and melted flesh. He looked like someone had thrown a human skeleton and a dog skeleton in a tank of dark red molten wax. The guy brought in the shirt and jeans was wearing. I hollowly put on my clothes. My body moved but my soul was trapped. My spirit was still chained to that chair. I wandered into the room where the night shift group was sitting around. I turned around and looked through the window. The large concrete basement had several floodlights set up and a set of chains attached to each end of the room. I limped through the doorway into a staircase going up. With every step, I felt my guilt weigh me down more. By the time I made it to the top of the stairs, I slowly pushed open the security door. I was in the hall. Across from me was the quiet room. I realized what it all meant. These animals I've been taking care of they're people. I had to walk through what I thought was a kennel but was actually a prison. I stood there attempting to brace myself for their accusing eyes. I slowly opened the door and their eyes were all glued to me. They looked with a mixture of pathetic begging and accusatory judgment. I thought is that why they always seemed off and why they stared too long. I thought i was doing a kindness caring for those who have no one else to depend on.



I was never their caretaker I was just another jailer. 



I looked down in shame and walked out the door. Margret was in the front room and she went to say something but I walked out into the bitter cold night. I know I should have found a ride or found a way to get home. It was too late for the bus to be running so I walked back to my apartment. 



I fell into bed and just laid there. 



I had no idea what to do my mind had just been opened to something I could never understand. It felt like I was damned what do I do now. What happened to these people? Why did I have to be part of this? What sickos were funding this? I barely moved for a few days as I let the world spin around me. Eventually, around noon on the third day I got a text from the major.



“Meet this evening time you get your promotion” 



I didn't say a word I just slowly got up and got dressed. 



I could work from inside to see if I can find a vulnerability in their system. 



I would set them free. 



I arrived at the shelter as the sun began to sneak below the horizon. 



The Major waited outside for me. It was the first time I had seen him smile. He pushed open the glass door and sitting on the counter was a plastic card. 



Wyatt Harris. Assistant Caretaker.



The major patted me on the back and handed me the card.



“Making your way up in the world,” he said as he set another item on the counter.



A taser with a leather holster. The yellow plastic perfectly fit in my hand as I clipped the holster onto my belt. 



“They seem to hate a shock so if you are in a bad spot this can give you a few moments to get out,” the major said as he patted me on the shoulder. 



I slowly nodded and asked.



“So what am I up to now” I asked.



The Major looked to the left and the right.



“Now you help keep the entertainment going” 



We walked into the secure room the major turned his body so I couldn't see the keypad as he tapped the buttons. Eventually with a loud beep the door opened. I walked down the stairs with the major through the door into the observation room. Two cages covered with sheets sat in the concrete room. I looked up and saw people. Sitting in stands above the open room were dozens of people. I couldn't make out their faces but they seemed to be getting into the stands and sitting to watch. Now I got what the major meant by entertainment. Two of the guys pulled the sheets off of the cages and sitting inside was two people. Two naked scarred men sat on the floor. The major hit the button on a PA system. 



“Ladies and gentlemen place your bets tonight bought Colt versus Cooper,” he said as he pulled a chair for me to sit. 



I sat down and before me was a console of buttons. The two other guys inside the room who pulled the sheets came back into the control room and took seats. The major pointed at a button for me to hit. I slowly pressed the button and the front gates off of the cages slowly lifted opening the fronts of the cages.



But they didn't move. 



They didn't budge. 



They looked pleadingly at each other as if begging for us to let them go. The Major pointed down at the console and there was a sticky note with a lightning bolt over a large red button. I stared down at it as the major began barking orders at me to hit the button. But I hesitated. However, before I could say anything the Major slammed the button and the two men convulsed as they were shocked. They screamed and howled as their bodies began to shift and change. Their skin split and muscle pushed through. Their bodies shifted as the animals took over. But they stopped halfway. Their bodies were turned into fleshy half half-melted dogmen their bodies looked like they were made out of molten wax that had been flash-frozen into a canine-human shape. The muscular and fanged bodies slowly stalked out of the cages. They ripped into each other. Their bodies began reforming and regenerating as their bodies immediately began healing as they ripped off chunks of flesh. And this was my life for the next few weeks. I walked dogs during the day and facilitated their torture at night. They battled each other and grappled but none of them got to die. They would all just come back. After one temporarily would collapse we would electrocute them into submission. Then dump them back into the kennel as their bodies would slowly reform into their dog shape. Eventually, The Major stopped hiding the code from me. I saw where he kept his keys. I ultimately had a plan. All I needed to do was release the dogs. One day. 



The golden opportunity suddenly opened one day for me. We were bringing in two dogs to do another match. Gage and Bandit. All of the employees with the rifles and cattle prods stood around waiting for seemingly anything to go wrong. And as we were closing the cages the door mechanism broke and dropped the heavy metal door on the majors foot. He screamed and howled in pain. But the moment the door jammed and wouldn't close it happened. Suddenly Gage's giant clawed hand lurched out and grabbed at the major. The major screamed and pulled his pistol firing wildly into the cage. I took this as my moment. I jumped onto the major knocking him to the ground. 



He screamed “Get the fuck off me” 



I popped the button on his belt and snatched his keyring. As I jumped up and ran I heard several cracks as bullets passed me hitting the concrete walls. I threw the door open and looked over at the control panel. I slammed the door behind me locking it. The night shift guards began firing into the cages at the dogmen inside. I looked down at the control panel and just started smashing buttons. The electric mechanisms whirred and ground as the cage doors began opening the giant monsters began ripping into the men. The predatory fury splattered against the bulletproof glass. One of the beasts paused and looked at me through the window. Gage. he paused for a moment before returning to the slaughter like he was thanking me for my part. I ran upstairs through the secure room and went into the kennel. The dogs were all silent. They stared blankly at me. I quickly got to work opening the cages though they still didn't move. I ripped the doors open and stepped into the doorway into the lobby. The dogs didn't move just stared. Though suddenly they looked towards the hallway across from me. Then I heard it. Crashing. They made it through the first door. They are coming upstairs. I ran into the lobby and as I was about to run out the glass door I heard it. The clicking of a revolver. I turned and Margret stood holding the gun. She opened her mouth to speak as the furred tide poured out of the door. All of them ran free. Jumping atop her ripping her to shreds leaving her a pile of bone and mush. 



Then it was my turn. 



I may have opened the doors but I still jailed them. They ran knocking me to the ground and shattering the glass of the building. They attacked me clawing and slashing into me. But they decided to be merciful. Leaving me lying on the ground bleeding and wheezing. I lay there still holding on falling in and out of consciousness. Eventually, the police arrived to find me. I was rushed to the hospital after a few days of questions and tests I was sent home.



Now comes the reason I'm posting this. One of them bit me. I don't remember which one but ever since then I've felt different. I keep blacking out and waking up. And I can hear them. Barking. 



Growling. 



Howling. 



I can feel their nails. Scratching at the inside of my skin. I can see the bones sliding under my muscles. I clawed my nails off on my floorboards to try and get them out. My bleeding fingernails pushed out to reveal claws. I’ve been sitting here feeling it. As the ribbons of my flesh begin slowly sloughing off my body I feel it coming. My mind is slipping. My new instincts are slowly taking over.



I'm so hungry



I already tried to swallow pills, slice open my wrists, something. I need to find silver.



But I'm so hungry
