I met this guy on BGMI (mobile gaming app) and played a lot together in the same squad. We became very good friends and started talking a lot. We also exchange Instagram and WhatsApp numbers. He is from Patiala and me from Mumbai. Also we have never met in person. We really liked each other’s companies, but were only friends. We really enjoy talking to each other and got along very well. We knew each other for almost 6 to 7 months. We spoke for hours on call, we’re practically together the whole day on either video call or game. It was lovely.

So i also suffer from a health issue of tachy cardia (heart issue) and i told him about it as i kept visiting the doctor almost everyday. The doctors advised me to walk every day and to put my sleeping cycle in place and to also lose a little weight. He truly seemed worried for me and decided to give me a wakeup call everyday at 5am to go for a walk. He used to do that everyday without fail and would also remain on call with me till i finished my walk. IMAGINE- an online friend caring so much.

So now here is the problem — while we were gaming, a random pervert stranger joined the lobby and started commenting on my profile picture saying i have huge boobs and started disrespecting me. Ofcourse i abused that stranger back but unfortunately my friend was quite throughout this argument. I felt really bad. After the game was done and the stranger left, i asked my friend as to why he did not stand up for me? He replied saying that he was on a call and he could not listen to anything so he did not know what happened. For some reason, I’m finding difficult to believe that he was actually on a call. So i got pissed off and started ignoring my friend.

He tried for a week daily to contact me by constantly calling me back to back, messaging me and double texting day and night but i never replied to him I just gave him very vague answers. I stopped responding to his wake up calls too. I was just deeply hurt. Im not sure to believe whether he was truly on a call or not. It’s just I got so deeply attached to this friend and I thought that he always had my back and some guy came and commented on my body, I just expected him to be there.

Am i wrong? Am i overthinking? Also he finally gave up and unfriended me from everywhere and seems very hurt. He also sent a mutual friend to talk to me and ask me as to what happened between us? And he also spoke very angrily about me behind my back to the mutual friend. He is hurt and pissed off and also said to the mutual friend that he has never ever sacrificed his sleep for anyone or done wake up calls for anyone. He did care a lot though. 

I unblocked him from everywhere too, waiting for him to message. Do you think i should message him? I do miss him. Please give me so perspective. We were very close. I feel a void. I too care a lot about him.
