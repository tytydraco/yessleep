I work at a children’s clothing store, and I think something is trying to talk to me through the radio.

It’s been two weeks since I started this job. Two weeks since the voices began.

When the store first opened, it was empty , just blank white walls and fluorescent lights buzzing in the ceiling. We had to build it up ourselves. I remember unboxing those mannequins for the first time. They came in pieces, packed in foam. Limbs, torsos, heads. Child-sized. Pale. Their porcelain faces had a sickly sheen under the lights.

I thought they looked too real.

But no one else said anything. We dressed them up, posed them in rows, and by the time the customers started coming, the store looked cheerful and welcoming. Pastel walls, tiny shoes, racks of glittery shirts. A perfect little paradise for children.

It was anything but.

The first time it happened, I was folding baby clothes with a colleague named Sam. “Flowers” by Miley Cyrus was playing, when the melody warped and cracked.  Thats when the voice came.

At first, faint. Distorted. Like someone choking on static.

“…elp usss…”

I froze, staring up at the ceiling speaker. Sam didn’t hear it. Or at least, she pretended not to. But when it came again ... louder this time,  she dropped the jacket she was holding.

“That’s creepy,” she muttered. Her face had gone pale.

I went to turn the radio off. My fingers brushed the power button and a shock shot through me, sinking deeper than my skin, like a hand grabbing my bones. The music cut off.

And the mall outside fell silent. Completely silent.

I stepped into the store. No customers. No sounds. Just mannequins, rows of them, frozen under the lights.

One of them , a child mannequin in a blue raincoat had turned. It was facing the register now. Facing me.

Then the speakers hissed.

Children’s voices spilled out. Dozens of them. Pleading. Crying. Begging.

“Help us. Please. Let us out.”

Their voices overlapped, filling the store until the air felt heavy with them.

And the mannequins moved. Not much, just enough that I knew it wasn’t my imagination. A hand twitched. A head tilted. The blue raincoat mannequin raised its face toward the speaker, as though it were listening.

Sam screamed. The mannequins stepped closer. The voices rose in a shrieking chorus.

Then, as quickly as it began, silence.

The mall sounds returned. The mannequins were still again. Sam ran out and never came back. Management said she quit. But I know better.

I kept working. I don’t know why. Maybe I wanted answers.

The voices haven’t stopped. Sometimes, between songs, I hear children whispering names. Sometimes laughter. Sometimes sobbing.

And the mannequins keep moving. Slowly. Subtly. The blue raincoat one especially. Every shift, it seems closer to the counter. Watching me.

I started looking at them differently. Not as store props. As… something else. Their porcelain skin wasn’t smooth after all. Under certain light, I saw faint lines. Cracks. As if the material had been shaped around something inside.

One night, I tapped on the cheek of the blue raincoat mannequin. It didn’t sound hollow. It sounded… dense. Like bone.

The next day, i was working with a temp called Joy , she lived up to her name ,One day i had asked her if she had heard anything weird on the radio and she said she hadn't, but on her break that day I saw her hold her necklace in her hand and chant something in Spanish over and over, I can only assume it was a protection chant and I suddenly didnt feel likei was going crazy
The voices on the radio were clearer than ever today .

I am working alone tonight till 20:00 and I heard them more clearly now .

“Let us out.”

Over and over.

I can’t stop wondering now. If they’re not mannequins at all. If they’re bodies. Children’s bodies.

Porcelain shells sealing them in.

Every time I walk past, I swear I feel eyes following me from behind the glassy paint of their stares.

Tonight, after closing, the radio turned on by itself. No music. Just static. And then the children’s voices came all at once.

“WE ARE IN HERE.”

The mannequins shifted, creaking, porcelain joints grinding. Their faces cracked just slightly, and I swear , I swear I saw something wet glisten inside. Flesh.

The blue raincoat mannequin is at the counter now. Its mouth is splitting. Porcelain flakes scattering onto the register.

The children on the radio are screaming.

“BREAK US. BREAK US. LET US OUT.”

I think I understand now.

I think these mannequins aren’t mannequins at all.

And if I don’t free them…

They’ll make me join them. Should I?
