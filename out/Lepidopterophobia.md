I had another panic attack today. I really do need to go up on my meds. My psychiatrist says exposure therapy would be good for me; I have crippling lepidopterophobia. Let’s just say I’m never willingly coming into contact with anything slightly resembling a moth or butterfly. Today, my nerves were set off by a flying beetle that I thought, for a moment, was a butterfly. Strange, I know; the person with a deformed, horrifying mess of a face, scared shitless of beautiful, harmless bugs.

I used to be relatively normal, however; twenty-two, a steady job and a nice enough apartment, a girlfriend, and my weekdays spent at community college. 

On a Friday in September, one I’ve tried for years to forget the events of, we decided to visit our local museum. It was boring, sure, but there wasn’t much to do in our sleepy city, and it was better than sitting around at home. Amy suggested going; she loved the museum, even if she wouldn’t admit it. In the six months we’ve been dating, we’ve gone together a decent amount of times. Admittedly, I only went for her, but the reason she went was for the butterfly gardens.

Amy was an artist. Not your typical hobbyist, however. She drew only one subject: members of the family Lepidoptera. Her apartment was adorned in carefully preserved butterflies, neat labels and stiff, dead wings behind glass frames. The walls had paintings and sketches of flying butterflies, butterflies feeding on flowers, moths building their cocoons, you name it. I never understood her obsession with them, but I figured it was harmless, if a little strange. 

I always loved going to the butterfly gardens with her. She’d go into almost a trance, finding our usual spot on a park bench and watching the insects go through their daily activities, sketchbook and watercolors in hand. I’d watch her draw more than I’d watch the butterflies; she captured the movement and vibrancy of each tiny muse with an impossibly low number of even brushstrokes. I wasn’t a huge fan of butterflies, but watching the way she depicted them, I could appreciate their beauty. 

On this particular day, the air was pleasant and cool as we walked to the museum a few miles from Amy’s apartment. Hand in hand, we wandered through the museum a bit before heading to our old haunt.

We stepped beneath the gaudily bright archway advertising the butterfly gardens, paying before walking through the various doors to go inside. 

I glanced at Amy to see her familiar reaction. She always seemed to be more alive and alert, a brightness to her eyes that was only there when she was painting or talking about things she liked. I smiled, squeezing her hand before making our way over to our usual bench and sitting down. 

Amy took out her sketchbook, telling me facts about the different species as she drew. I listened, watching the fluttering wings of hundreds of butterflies as they drank nectar, built cocoons, and explored the enclosure. 

Ten peaceful minutes passed before I glimpsed something from the corner of my eye; a flash of color, too large to be a butterfly. I interrupted Amy’s rambling.

“Did you see that?” I gestured to the bushes where I thought I saw the moving colors. Nothing was there now.

Amy looked up, following my gaze and shrugging. “No, what was it?”

“Nothing. I’m probably just tired” I smiled sheepishly and we fell into a comfortable silence. I’d been watching Amy draw, and when I looked back up, I noticed most of the butterflies were resting on flowers, almost none flying around.

“Huh. Why’d they just stop?” I asked Amy. I'd never seen the whole group this lethargic before. 

Amy looked up from her page sharply, before a look of understanding spread across her face. “They’re here,” she murmured, so softly I almost missed it.

“What?” I stared uneasily at her, suddenly feeling a prickling sensation, like we were being watched. I scanned the garden, but it was empty besides us and the butterflies.

“Nothing, sweetie. You’ll know soon enough” Amy gave me a sweet smile, but I wasn’t reassured. She was being so strange all of a sudden. 

A rustling from behind us sent my heart pounding, and I whipped around. Nothing was there. “What the fuck?” I was starting to get nervous. I told myself I was just imagining things and tried to relax. 

When I turned back to Amy, she was sitting so still she could’ve been paralyzed. “Amy,” I said sharply, sure she was pranking me or something. Amy’s eyes seemed to be unfocused, but my voice brought her back to reality, and she smiled at me.

“Do you trust me?” She asked in a soft tone.

“Amy, what the fuck is going on?” My voice was a little shaky now; I looked away from her and saw that the butterflies were all sitting perfectly still on the ground, closer to us than they should be, hundreds of tiny wings still other than the occasional flutter. 

“They need to feed,” was Amy’s only reply. Her smile turned sad as she rolled up her sleeves. “I’m so sorry.”

I slapped a hand over my mouth, horrified. Her arms were covered in tiny scars, little round welts like they’d been pricked with dozens of needles. Before I had time to question her, a bright blue butterfly landed on her arm. I stared, openmouthed, as Amy’s eyes fluttered closed. The butterfly’s proboscis extended, a perfectly round drop of blood forming in one of the wounds as the butterfly drank.

“Amy!” I yelled, my face going white as I leapt to my feet, grabbing her by the arm and pulling her after me. I was too late. Butterflies started swarming over Amy, their wings rippling like a sea of multicolored waves as they enveloped her body. 

I screamed and tried to shoo them away, but there were too many. My yells were silenced by a hand wrapping around from behind me to cover my face. I jerked around and felt every ounce of hope leave my body at the sight of the creature. 

A man stood before me, his skin covered in so many of the little pinpricks that you couldn't even see what his skin tone used to be. There was nothing left but tiny scabs, some piled on top of each other to create little craters in his skin. His body wasn’t what drew my eye, however. His face was covered by a huge butterfly, perching there perfectly centered to cover his eyes. Its wings shivered slightly, the only sign of life it showed. A thick, yellow fluid was crusted around its proboscis, which was embedded in the man’s forehead.

A cry escaped my lips, muffled by the creature’s hand. Tears pricked my eyes as they fell to its mouth; no lips, just inflamed gums and yellowed teeth, with a long proboscis emerging from between them. Even the proboscis was covered in scabs, and looked so painful my own tongue hurt. 

The creature’s head was cocked towards me, even though it couldn’t possibly see through the massive wings obscuring its vision. 

“We are hungry,” it whispered. Its voice wasn’t human; it was a raspy slither of words, shaking like the wings of the butterflies all around me. It sounded like someone who hadn’t spoken in years. I choked out a terrified sob, coming to my senses as my hands went up to grip its wrists, tugging at them. The thing was impossibly strong despite its lacerated, skeletal body, and it had no reaction to my struggling. 

“Feed us,” the creature spoke again, its rasping words sending a chill throughout my entire body. It slowly brought its hands away from my face and I ran. It just stood there, watching. I raced to Amy, she was covered in insects and I couldn’t even make out the person beneath. 

“Amy, we have to get out!” I screamed, grabbing her forearm and feeling nauseous at the squish and crunch of butterflies beneath my hand. I pulled her with me to the entrance, she didn’t make a sound as the creatures drank their fill of her blood. 

There was no door.

I sank to my knees, sobbing and pounding on the wall, which had gone from transparent panes of glass to solid white. “Shit!”

I felt a hand on my shoulder, my eyes fixing on the bumpy, deformed skin of the monster. I looked up to see it craning its neck down towards me. 

“Feed us once, or feed us many,” it rasped, its proboscis flicking out towards me. I shrank from it, still trying to wrap my head around our situation. 

“Choose.” It insisted, before wrapping its spindly fingers around my neck and lifting me from the ground. I choked for air, kicking out wildly, but it held on tight. Suddenly, I knew what it wanted. 

I didn’t know enough about my choices to know which was preferable, but I didn’t have time to think. 

“Once,” I coughed out. “I’ll feed them once.”

Slowly, the creature lowered me to the ground, its face expressionless. I don’t like remembering what comes next. In fact, I’ve spent my whole life trying to forget it. I can only hope writing this out will help me come to terms with what I’ve been through. 

The creature caressed my face, almost fondly, and I waited. My whole body was shaking with dread, and as the creature stepped away a little, I looked down. My skin was translucent. It was drying before my eyes, delicate veins forming patterns beneath the surface. I couldn’t make a sound, couldn’t even scream, as I felt the skin on my face thin and crack. I realized with horror what my skin resembled; a leaf. 

The lips were the worst part. A wordless cry of agony ripped through me as my lips cracked apart, slowly peeling back like the petals of a flower until I was sure my gums were just as exposed as the creatures. 

Finally, I fed them. 

I felt its proboscis tear my throat as it drank. My mouth was a flower, my flesh and blood and viscera the nectar. It drank its fill. The giant wings on its face started to flap, slowly at first before picking up speed as it fed.

I can’t describe the pain I felt; I couldn’t breath, my eyes wide and stinging with tears, my dry skin flaking off in places, blood dripping from my ruined mouth. It was over shortly. The creature’s proboscis curled back into a resting position, awful chunks of things I didn’t want to identify stuck to it, covered in thick red liquid. 

If only that was all. Sharp little stabs of pain drew my attention to my arms, and I tried to scream, something my ruined lungs were no longer capable of. A few swollen, engorged butterflies had made their way over to me after their feast of Amy’s blood. They were crawling into my skin. I felt their tiny wings beating against my flesh as they somehow managed to dig out little tunnels beneath my skin. I clawed at my arms, feeling the squish of insects that I managed to get to, but it was impossible to kill them all. My face paled as I felt the wings stop flapping. They were dead. They’d created little graves in my body, deciding for whatever reason that their ideal coffins were walls of flesh. 

I fell to the floor, my shoulders shaking with sobs as I wheezed in air. I watched wordlessly as the creature dropped down beside me, crawling back into the bushes on all fours. 

I’m not sure how long I laid there, listening to the flapping wings of the butterflies swarming over Amy’s body, the wet sounds of wounds reopening, and feeling the dull throb of pain that stabbed through my arms.

 When it was over, Amy lay beside me, her arms a bloody mess that I couldn’t stomach looking at. I rolled over and vomited, feeling empty as I stared into the chunks of red flesh I’d just purged from my body. 

Amy got up a few minutes later. She pulled her sleeves back over her arms, her face sorrowful as she pulled me to my feet. I didn’t fight; I was in shock, shaking and crying and gingerly feeling my awful, peeled lips, sticky and hot from freshly clotting blood.

“You’re free now. It’s over,” Amy murmured, and I understood. I didn’t have the energy to be relieved; I just nodded numbly. 

The door was back. We took the outside exit, Amy ushering me along. A blur of doctors and sterile scents and medicine was all I knew next. She left me at the ER, and I never saw her again. 

I still wonder what happened to Amy. I'm not ashamed to admit I’m terrified of her. I don’t know how much she was in control of. All I do know is that she chose many; I chose few. I know, deep down, that she’s suffered so much more than I did. I made the correct choice. I got away. 

I’ve never recovered from what happened, unsurprisingly. I have panic attacks at the mere sight of one of those disgusting, winged creatures. My skin became normal after a while, but my mouth is ruined, along with my throat. I look disgusting. Safe to say, there are no mirrors in my new apartment.

I can’t talk anymore. My vocal cords were irreparable. I’m essentially a hermit at this point. I avoid going outside at all costs. The gasps of people at my appearance hurt, of course, but the real reason is fear.

 The doctors had no idea what could’ve happened, but strangely, no one investigated it. There are things in this world that can’t be investigated, I suppose. They have too much power. 

I’m telling you all of this for three reasons: one, my therapist told me writing out traumatic experiences can help you come to terms with them. Two, some selfish desire to be understood, for people to know why I look and act the way I do. And lastly, most importantly, to warn you. Don’t visit your local butterfly garden. 

And choose ‘once’.
