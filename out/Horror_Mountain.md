The small-town arcade, Retro Realm, was the only place where 16-year-old Evan felt truly alive. Nestled between a dusty bookstore and an old laundromat, it smelled of stale popcorn, cheap soda, and decades of teenage sweat. Evan spent all his spare cash and time there, immersed in pixelated worlds where he could be the hero he never felt like in real life.

One day, something new caught his eye. At the back of the arcade, where the older, dimly-lit machines hummed faintly, a cabinet he’d never seen before stood waiting. The marquee above it read: Horror Mountain in jagged red letters, glowing ominously. The game’s art featured a crumbling town overrun by grotesque monsters.

Evan’s heart raced. He had to try it.

He slipped in a quarter and grabbed the joystick. The screen crackled to life, displaying a familiar setting—his own hometown, now shrouded in fog and terror. The game’s objective was simple: survive the night and defeat the evil forces overtaking the town.

As he played, Evan noticed something unsettling. The game was eerily detailed, replicating the streets of his neighborhood, the park, even Retro Realm itself. Soon, his pixelated avatar was battling hordes of zombies and dodging clawed demons that leapt from shadows. The monsters grew smarter, faster, and more terrifying with every level.

Evan was so engrossed he didn’t notice the arcade lights flicker or the way the other machines powered down one by one. His hands trembled on the joystick as a blood-curdling vampire boss emerged on the screen. Its glowing red eyes seemed to pierce through the glass, locking onto him.

Suddenly, the screen went black. The joystick in his hand felt cold and wet, like it was covered in something slick. He looked down—his hand was gripping a severed arm, not a joystick.

Evan staggered back, his surroundings shifting. He wasn’t in Retro Realm anymore. He was standing in the middle of his town, now warped and twisted into a nightmare. The sky was a sickly green, and monstrous creatures roamed the streets.

His pulse thundered as he sprinted down Main Street, dodging a horde of zombies gnashing their teeth. The vampires swooped from above, and demons crawled out from storm drains, their guttural growls chasing him. He screamed as one demon clawed at his leg, but he kicked it away and kept running.

Finally, he reached his house, slamming the door behind him. The living room was just as he’d left it, warm and safe. Breathing heavily, he sank onto the couch.

It had to be a dream, he thought. Just a game messing with his head.

But as he looked up, his TV screen flickered to life. The title Horror Mountain appeared, glowing with the same menacing red letters. Beneath it, the words PRESS PLAY pulsed like a heartbeat.

Evan froze, his blood running cold. The screen flickered again, showing his pixelated avatar standing outside his house, surrounded by monsters.

The TV snapped off, leaving him in darkness.

Evan sat there, too terrified to move, as a faint whisper echoed in his ear: “Your turn to play.”
