“What was the point of me even bringing you here if all you do is eat the peanuts?" I grumbled as I stubbed my cigarette out on Malcolm’s hand, the red head glancing up at me for only a second to see what was burning him before he swatted it and looked away, looking up at the baseball game playing on the TV mounted on the bar wall as he mindlessly popped another peanut into his mouth.

“Can you at least deshell them, you mongrel?" I asked the Colombian man while I took a swig of my raspberry martini, boredly spinning the little umbrella that had come with the drink as I watched Malcolm with my head cocked to the side, resting my head on my now free hand, sighing through his nose as a playful smile formed on my face.

 “I'm not a mongrel. You’re the mongrel, changeling." The red-head muttered softly as he ate another peanut, not even noticing the man sitting down next to him while he kept watching the game.

“Don't call me a changeling, Mal..” I said with a slight smile before I looked away and to my drink, sitting the drink’s umbrella down to the side before I gestured for the bartender, our good friend Bonnie, to come over while the older man tried to scoot closer to my friend and get his attention.

“Hey, honey, what’s a pretty lady like you doing here, hm?” I heard the man ask as he placed a hand on his lower back and leaned in close, but by then I started tuning the two out since I could feel myself getting annoyed.

“Don't let it bother you too much. You're pretty overprotective, babes.” Bonnie said, somewhat mocking my Australian accent as she tucked some of her white hair behind her ear, mindless grabbing stuff to make me another Martini while I just kept staring at the bar counter in front of me, and I could feel my annoyance get worse as I kept trying to make sure I didn't hear Malcolm or the man’s talk.

“You know how he is, Bon. He's more of a succubus than a vampire at this point… It's gonna get him killed.” I muttered lowly, my eyes narrowing as I glanced up at the albino woman, and I could see the look of understanding in her eyes as she placed another Raspberry Martini in front of me.

“He's not a baby. Let him hunt how he wants to hunt, even if that means getting his rocks off in the process.” She said, offering a toothy canine-filled smile before she went to tend to other customers, and I ended up lying my arms on the bar in front of me, playing with the umbrella in the new martini, just until a few minutes later I heard Malcolm and the man get up from the bar.

I grabbed the new drink and chugged it before I got up and followed behind them, and I honestly felt like a creep, almost like I was stalking pray as I followed behind them in the San Francisco streets, making sure I was far back enough the old man wouldn't notice me, but I knew Malcolm could tell I was following them.

I ended up sitting on the floor outside of Malcolm’s apartment for about three ours and forty-seven minutes, ignoring the rhythmic thumping coming inside as I smoked my third cigarette and scrolled on my phone while I waited for Malcolm to finish. It was nearing eleven twenty when Mal opened the apartment door, his long hair disheveled and a bloody smile on his face as he beckoned me to come inside, so I stood up and walked in, stopping once I saw the nearly dead man on the floor of the redhead's apartment.

“Are you done?" I asked as I nudged the body with my boot, the man flickering in and out of consciousness from the blood loss, and Malcolm shut the apartment door before walking over and wrapping his arms around me in a quick hug, and I could feel his green eyes boring into me as I tried to ignore his stare. “Yes, you can eat now, mi querido amigo!” He happily said to me while pulling away and walking off to the kitchen to clean his face.

I feel oddly disgusted for admitting how I ate the man, and each time I take a bite I get the same sense of dread I've had from the start.

I ripped into his body, first ripping his throat open and eating down to his spine to the point that the space from his collar bone and his jaw bone was bare, and he was most definitely dead by then.

Then, I began ripping an arm off from his elbow before I used my nails and teeth to peel his skin off. Its texture is disgusting. Once done peeling, I ate all the muscles, fat, veins, everything, down to the bone while letting myself get covered in the blood, intestinal fluids, everything, like an animal. 

I'm not sure how long it took me to eat his neck, arm, some shoulder meat down to the bone, and then most of his side to where his ribs were visible and a few of his organs were trying to fall out before I finally stopped, but I kept wanting to eat despite being full because of the weird thrill I get for doing something so disgusting.

 I just stared at the body, flesh and what little blood he had left dripping from my face and onto my clothes, and I just stared, and stared, and stared, even as a wave of nausea crashing onto me like it always did every time I ate, I just kept staring while I remembered how much I hated eating people, but something about them was just so much better than animals, and the plus side was that it helps hide the people Malcolm has fed on.

It makes me think of the first time I ate a person back around 1912. I was  a teenager and I was starving on the streets when someone came up to me with a pouch of money, offering me a deal that was basically I had to eat someone, still alive, and he'd give me money. If I didn't take it he said he would beat the shit out of me, and then make me watch as I got gutted alive, just for him to finish by strangling me with my own intestines if I wasn't already dead by then.

I knew he wouldn't be able to kill me just like that so I wasn't worried, but I was so hungry and the thought of eating someone had never occurred to me, so in that moment it wasn't all that unappealing to think about. Now that I'm older I can safely say this was some weird fetish stuff this guy had, and not sure what it would be called, but I had participated in getting him off by eating this drugged up homeless man the guy had picked, and because of how hungry I was and how thin the man was, I ate almost everything off of his legs, arms, and half of his pelvis that day, even eating his frostbitten leg and Psoriasis covered skin that now makes it impossible for me to eat anything with similar textures.

So, as I kept staring at the man I had just ate in Malcolm’s apartment I grew more ill feeling, but thankfully it didn't take long until I felt his hand come to cup my face and turn it away so I could look at him before he pushed a pill into my mouth for the nausea I felt everytime, and this time he even muttered soft words of praise in Spanish as he helped me stand up and brought me to the kitchen sink to clean my face off. Pill’s always still tasted nasty, even with water to wash them down.

We ended the night with him helping me clean myself and the mess up, and then we drained the body of what little blood Malcolm didn't drink for a while, finally finishing it off by hiding what was left so I could eat more later, and with how Malcolm looked at me the whole time despite the horrible thing we had just done, I'm ashamed that I didn't finally say something in that moment, but I have no idea how.

I love him, and it's obvious to everyone except him despite us knowing each other since 1937. He's from the beginning of the 1800s, so I'm not surprised it goes over his head, but he's the only reason I'm still in this city and I hadn't moved to the Netherlands, yet I have no idea how to tell him.

I'm not going to live forever, I'm technically middle aged for a Fae, and I know he'll easily outlive me but I have no idea if I'll even tell him.

If anyone has any advice for how to tell him, or has any questions or would like to hear some stories about us, that would be appreciated so I can take my mind off stuff.
