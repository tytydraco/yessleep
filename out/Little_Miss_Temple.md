Normally he'd be speeding down this road, windows down, cigarette (or the occasional joint) in his hand, but today was one of those days where he couldn't risk it. It was one of those edgy days. He kept glancing in the rearview mirror, not only to make sure no one was following him, but more importantly,  to keep an eye on the little one sleeping in the backseat. 

Who does she remind me of? he thought. It's driving me crazy, right on the tip of my tongue, but I can't think of the name. Maybe when she wakes up it'll come to me. As if on cue, she stirred and lifted her head, looking around with puffy, half-opened eyes. 

"Well hey there, sleepyhead! How ya doing?" he asked. 

She blinked several times and yawned. "Who are you?"

He looked at her, puzzled. "I'm Steven - your new babysitter. Didn't your mom and dad tell you about me? They said they were going to." He paused and then frowned. "Are you sure they didn't say anything?" 

She yawned again. "I don't know. Where are we going? Where's Mommy and Daddy?" 

"Mommy and daddy? I'm sorry to tell you this but.....they're lying in puddles of blood after I bashed their faces in, which is why you're in my car right now. They're on their bedroom floor, probably in hell - you know about hell?? Satan, the hounds, the beasts, eternal fires, all that? Scary things you see, only in your nightmares! But this could be a happy reunion. Because if you try anything, you're joining them." 

He let out a little snort; what a reply. He looked in the rearview expecting her to be waiting for an answer, but she was picking her nose and looking out the window. So he pulled something out of his ass and doubted she was listening anyway.

"Your mommy and daddy had to go into work for something very important. They asked me to pick you up and drive you to school this morning. I'll drop you off and then get you when school is out. How does that sound?" 

"Okay! I can spell cat. K A T, cat. I can spell dog! D O G G, dog. Mrs. Mayfield says I can spell lots of things!"

He really, really disliked kids, but listening to them talk was the worst. It always boggled his mind that people WANT this. He hated having to fake interest, because the more he had to engage, the more THEY talked, too. They never shut up! You could be dead silent and they would come up with something that made zero sense, just to talk, and one of these days, the right kid just might make him drive off a cliff for good. 

BUT. 

If talking kept them occupied, distracted, and happy, he could put up with their endless chitchat for a little while. Emphasis, of course, on the little part.

"Wow! You're a great speller! What else do you know?" 

"I know maths. 1+1 is 2. 2+1 is 3. 3+1 is 7. And 4+1 is 8!" 

He wanted to laugh, but then slightly started to feel a little sorry for this one. She was adorable, but by God, not the sharpest tool in the shed by any means. Most kids at that age really aren't, I guess, but ... let's just say, the road ahead would lead her nowhere. He chuckled to himself as he visualized her walking down a deserted road, choosing the path with a big old rickety sign that said, "NOWHERE." 

"So.... you're a great speller AND great at math? You know a lot! How old are you?" 

"I'm this many," and she held up six fingers. "And it's my birfday soon!"

"You're such a big girl! When will you be seven?"

"I don't know. Is it cold outside? 

"What? I don't know, why?"

"Mommy puts these on me when it's cold outside. And then we build a snowman!" 

He looked in the rearview mirror and saw she had pulled back the cover over his tools: a crowbar, wire cutters, black mask, black gloves, and the hammer with dried blood on it. 

God dammit! This is sloppy. They should be in the trunk, out of sight, and that hammer should be spotless. What if I got pulled over? In an accident? These are things that I really can't afford to mess up. He made a mental note to get his shit together so this wouldn't happen again.

"Uh, yeah, yeah it's cold out. Don't play with those, they're for grown ups. SO STOP TOUCHING THEM!" he yelled. 

She shrunk back in her seat, looking hurt, and just as he thought she would burst into tears, she looked out the window. 

"Where are we going?"

"I ALREADY TOLD YOU! I'm taking you to school! If I have to -" but he stopped, and reminded himself to tone it down, cool off, be calm... babysitters don't scream at kids, do they? At least normal ones don't. 

"I mean ... we're going to school!" he said cheerfully. "Are you excited?" 

"Yay! I can see Mrs. Mayfield! Yay yay yay yay!" But then her expression changed. "Wait. You're silly! We go to school until Fridays. And it's after Fridays. I don't have school today. You're silly! I'm going to call you Silly Steven!" she said, giggling. 

Damn. Still definitely not a rocket scientist by any means, but not a complete nitwit. 

"Oh, that's right!" He slapped his hand on his forehead in an exaggerated motion. "See, I know it's not Friday. But since your mom and dad will be at work for a while, Mrs. Mayfield said she'd watch you while I went to the store, even though there's no school. But hey! You get TWO babysitters today!" 

At this point he didn't even care if what he said made sense; he was almost to his destination anyway. And this kid, cute as she was, was as ADHD as ever. In one ear, out the other. She was probably still thinking about how to incorrectly spell cat, or dog. 

"Yay!!! Can we play dollies, Silly Steven?" 

"Absolutely, whatever you want!" 

He looked at her again and finally realized who she reminded him of. With her short, corkscrew curls, her little dimples, the frilly dress she was wearing, the Mary Jane's with socks pulled up to her ankles... Shirley Temple. The famous little actress who everyone adored. The resemblance was uncanny, actually. 

"Do you know who Shirley Temple is?" 

"Is that the girl with curly hair? Daddy always sings me this song..."

'Dimples and curls, dimples and curls, 
The sweetest girl in all the world. 
Made of rainbows, butterflies, and very special...
She's my little Miss Shirley Temple.'

Inwardly he rolled his eyes, but instead he said, "Yup! You look just like her! And your dad is such a great poet. Maybe you'll be an actress one day with how smart you are, too!" 

He couldn't believe these words were coming from his mouth, and was honestly ready to bang his head on the steering wheel when, by the grace of God, the school appeared up ahead. 

"Oh, hey, look! Looks like we're almost to school!" he said in a singsong voice.

This was the part he hated most, since it was by far the riskiest. Pull up, out, off. As far as he could tell there were no cameras installed outside the building, but any day that could change. He was formulating a backup plan in case it happened, but for now, the school was the best option - kids are familiar with it. It's a normal place for them. So when they hear they're "going to school," no alarms go off. Especially with this little moron, he snickered. 

He had barely pulled up to the curb when the door flung open, and a hand unbuckled the little girl's seatbelt and yanked her out. 

She looked around and then up into the face of a woman she didn't recognize. "You're not Mrs. Mayfield. Where's Mrs Mayfield?" 

"Oh, right!" the woman laughed. "Mrs. Mayfield is sick today. She asked me to come here instead. I'm Mrs. Smith," she said with a smile. "We're going to have so much fun today!" 

She quickly and nonchalantly looked around, and then, as fast as the little girl had been removed from the car, "Mrs. Smith" squeezed the little girl's wrists and snarled, "If you try anything funny, you'll never see her, or anybody else, ever again." 

The last thing the little girl saw before she was pushed into the van was a smiling Steven waving and yelling, "Have a good day, Miss Shirley Temple!" 

*****

The following morning, Mrs. Mayfield was up early, thinking about how happy this day always made her. The cake was cooling off on the countertop, and shortly she would be icing it. She knew teachers weren't supposed to have "favorite students," but this little girl was the exception to the rule. "Little Miss Shirley Temple," she thought with a smile. Because that's exactly who she looked like - short hair, tight corkscrew curls, always wearing a little frilly dress, with her Mary Jane's and socks pulled up. Just as cute as a button and larger than life as well. 

Sometimes Mrs. Mayfield felt sad and worried for her; there were definite signs of delays, a lot of attention issues, and she was certainly not at the top of the class, but in the end, would this be what's most important? Because her ability to love anyone, her kindness, friendliness, and that larger than life personality were what made her stick out. And although she was only six, Mrs. Mayfield loved to imagine who she'd become in her adult years: an artist, a nurse, maybe even a teacher! Mrs. Mayfield had special plans to always look after her, encourage her, value her.... especially as she'd get older and, as sad as it was to think about, the bullies would pounce on her. But out of all the students she'd taught, this sweet, simple child deserved a life of happiness.

While the cake was cooling, she opened the newspaper and browsed the front page. She sighed. Another day, another terrifying headline at the top: 

"SMALL TOWN TERROR: MAYOR VOWS TO CRACK DOWN ON SEX-TRAFFICKING CRISIS WHILE OFFICIALS SAY THE CLOCK IS TICKING."

She looked up at the cake, ready to be iced, ready to be delivered to a sweet, innocent child, and folded the paper.

"What a cruel, sick world we live in," she murmured.
