When I was seven, my older cousin (let's call him Jake), told me about the "Shadow Man". He said it was just a dumb story, meant to scare kids like me into behaving, but it stayed with me long after he’d left for the summer.

The Shadow Man, according to Jake, wasn’t like the monsters in fairy tales. He didn’t live under the bed or hide in the basement. No, he stayed in your closet, waiting silently in the dark. He didn’t need to eat or sleep or move much at all. He only cared about one thing : An open closet door.

Jake said that if you left your closet even slightly open, the Shadow Man would come out when the lights went off. He’d stand there, watching you from the corner of your room, waiting for the perfect moment to step closer, like those night terrors that always terrified me as well.   
You wouldn’t see him clearly, only a shape in the dark, blacker than the darkness around him. And if you saw him and acknowledged him, that was it. He’d take you, and no one would ever know what happened.

Jake laughed when I started crying, but that night, I made sure my closet door was shut tight. 

For years, I couldn’t sleep without checking it first. It became a habit, even long after I convinced myself the Shadow Man wasn’t real.

Anyways, a few weeks ago, I moved into a new apartment. It’s small, but it’s mine, and I was excited to finally have a place to call my own. The first night, I noticed the closet door didn’t quite latch properly. It’d swing open just an inch or two if I didn’t prop something against it. I laughed it off at first, thinking about Jake’s stupid story, but as I got into bed, I couldn’t shake the nagging feeling I’d had as a kid.

I got up, shoved a chair against the closet door, went back to bed, and laughed at myself for behaving as such a child.

But around 3 a.m., I woke up to the sound of something scraping across the floor. My heart was pounding before I even opened my eyes. When I finally dared to look, the chair was pushed aside, and the closet door was open, just a crack.

I told myself it was nothing, just the draft from the window or the fact that the floor wasn’t level. I got up, closed the door, and put the chair back, trying to ignore the cold sweat dripping down my back.

The next night, it happened again. And the night after that. But that night was different.

I woke up to the sound of breathing. Slow, deliberate, coming from the corner of the room.

I couldn’t move. My eyes were locked on the closet door, now wide open, and the figure standing just inside. It wasn’t moving, but I knew it was looking at me. The shadows around it seemed to ripple, pulling the air out of the room.

I don’t remember falling asleep, but I woke up this morning to find the closet door shut.

I don't know if this was a figment of my imagination, if it was an all-too-realistic night terror, or if I actually experienced it for real, but one thing is certain.   
I live alone.
