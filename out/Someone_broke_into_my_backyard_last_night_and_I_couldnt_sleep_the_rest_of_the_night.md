Something happened last night that made me too scared to sleep for the rest of the night. It was one of the scariest things to ever happen to me, which isn't saying much, as I have a pretty boring life.

Pretty much about everything in my life is boring. My house is a single floor, I don't have any gardens, my lawn is half dead. My backyard  is not that big, with a driveway on the right stretching from the street in front of my house to the garage which is in my backyard, taking up 40% of the entire yard.

Right outside of my garage, there are two bins, one for recyclables, and the other for regular garbage. 

The only type of security I have in my house is a camera attatched to the front of my garage, which overlooks the driveway. It has a microphone on it so I can talk through it.

It always seems like it's either cloudy out, or raining. Tonight it was cloudy.

It was around 1:00 AM and I was trying to fall asleep. Everything was quiet, my dog was asleep at my feet, my cat staring out the window in the living room. I was tossing and turning, and for some reason I wasn't falling asleep.

About 20 minutes later, I started hearing noises outside in my backyard, kinda like something going through my two bins. I figured it was just a raccoon going through my garbage, as I had a pretty greasy burger for dinner tonight and it leaked onto the plate I was eating it on. 

I tried to ignore the noise, but that didn't work for long, as apparently my dog heard it too, and so he started barking loudly. I got tired of this and decided to let my dog out so he would hopefully chase away whatever was going through my garbage.

When I let my dog out, I turned back to sit in the living room to wait for him. I heard my dog barking loudly, but then he stopped. After about 15 seconds, my dog starts barking in a high pitched tone, like dogs do when they're hurt or scared. 

I then heard my dog scratching on my door to come inside. I let him inside and he ran to my bedroom. I followed him, and he was just standing on my bed, shaking violently, like he just heard a gunshot or thunder.

I stare at my dog and wonder what scared him so bad, as a raccoon wouldn't have scared him like this. I walk to my back door and look outside, trying to see what scared him. 

Nothing. 

Now I'm confused, because I heard what I thought was a raccoon, so I let my dog out to chase it away, but my dog ends up being chased back into the house by... Nothing.

So I decided to go check it out myself. 

I grabbed a flashlight from my bedroom and head to the back door, slowly opening the door and stepping outside.

My backyard was pitch black, I couldn't see shit. Even when I turned my flashlight on, it was like everything around the beam of light my flashlight emitted was covered in a light-absorbing blanket.

I shine my flashlight around, seeing absolutely nothing. I shine it across my lawn, working my way to the back fence, then to the garbage cans, and that's when I started to get scared.

Something made an absolute mess of my garbage cans. Garbage was scattered all over the driveway, and I mean ALL OVER the driveway. It was like something took my garbage bagsc ripped them open, and flung all the garbage inside all over my driveway.

Now I'm starting to feel a bit scared, but also pissed, since something just trashed my backyard, and I'm gonna have to clean all this up. I walk outside more and walk to the driveway, looking down the concrete path. 

My fence was wide open. As in, something or someome opened my fence and went into my backyard. Now, the feeling of fear is starting to overcome the feeling of anger in my brain, so I decide to listen to my fear and go inside the house.

I walk back to my bedroom. My dog is now under my bed, still shaking. I sit on my bed, thinking about what made such a mess in my yard, and how I'm gonna clean it all up.

Suddenly, I get a notification on my phone. I look at the notification. "SOUND HEARD: Sound heard on 'Garage Camera'." My garage camera was picking up noises. Maybe it was picking up whatever went through my garbage?

I tap the notification and listen in.

I expected to hear rustling or chattering or something, but no. I heard grunting. Like a human grunting.

I keep my camera up and go grab my house phone to call 911. I've dialed "91" when I hear another noise that was picked up on the camera.

The thing behind my garage spoke. I didn't hear everything that was said, but I did hear "blood" and "bones."

I figured this was a person, since it can speak. So I turn on the mic on my camera and say "Hey, asshole. Get out of my yard or I'm calling the cops."

That was a huge mistake. Now the guy knew I was watching him. But here's where I actually felt the most fear of the night.

The guy steps out from behind my garage. He was dressed in a really ripped up shirt and pants, like he was put through a shredder. He walks in front of my camera and just stares at it.

He just kept staring at it, and I don't even remember seeing him blink once. He just looked into the camera.

I finished dialing 911 and and heard the operator. I also left the camera microphone on so the guy would hear that I'm calling the police.

"911, please state your emergency."

I was about to say that someone was in my yard when I looked back at my cell phone.

The man in my yard was holding something. I zoomed in on what he was holding, and I just froze.

It was a torn blue piece of cloth, with a bronze badge shaped like a shield pinned to it. There was blood on the badge.

The man was smiling nefariously. He was tilting his head to one side.

I heard the operator on the other end of the phone.

"Whoever this is? Please only call this number for actual emergencies."

I yell "Nonono- wait!" But she hangs up before she hears me.

I look at the camera and shiver.

The man holds out a bone. Not a bone of an animal, but a human bone, I think from the arm.

I just sat on my bed for the rest of the night and stared into nothing. I couldn't sleep. I didn't want to sleep. I was scared of what would happen if I did.

It's now 9:00 AM and I'm in my living room. The man is gone. But I still remember that nefarious look he gave the camera while holding the remains of the police uniform.. And the human bone he held.
