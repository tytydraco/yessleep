I can't believe I'm writing this, can't believe this is my life, I never thought in a million years I'd end up with a mother-in-law who'd try to destroy my life and marriage.

I mean, Jesus Christ, I watched my own mother suffer under the passive aggressive jabs and interference of my grandma - my dad's mom.

One time my mom got drunk and told me all about it. Grandma quietly tortured her the **day** my dad proposed. Making nasty comments about how the ring didn't fit my mom's chubby finger and the ring would need to be resized.

Of course it got worse from there.

Blame shifting, gaslighting, insults - Grandma did it all.

But rarely when anyone was around to see. I saw it once when I came in the kitchen and they were there, just the two of them. Grandma was criticizing my mom's mashed potatoes saying they were too runny, too salty, my mom was a "shit cook". And she could not believe my mom subjected us to this "garbage".

Mom kept it together but I could tell she wanted to cry. As soon as Grandma heard me behind her, she hit a switch - sweet as molasses on shit.

I never trusted her after that.

And I resented my dad for not sticking up for my mom. I can't believe they never got divorced! I can't believe my mom didn't slap the shit outta both of them!

I avoided Grandma as much as possible. Until my mom begged me to visit her, because of course, Grandma blamed mom and made her life even worse.

And still, my mom cried at her funeral. Like real tears. Not tears of joy and relief. But tears of actual *sorrow*. I couldn't believe it. Maybe she had Stockholm Syndrome...

I swore, after seeing years of what my mom went through, there was NO WAY IN HELL I would end up in the same mess.

And yet, here I am.

I'm changing all the names for this post. My mother-in-law is Jean (70), my husband is Paul (42), and I'm (f/40). Paul and I have been married almost 10 years, no kids (we decided a long ago time kids weren't in our future, and Jean was disappointed at first but got over it).

The reason I'm posting this is to get some advice, and so I don't feel so damn alone. I need an outlet that isn't breaking shit or screaming out the window.

Paul's at work and will be back in an hour so I have to do this fast. I'm sitting in my car right now down the street from my house. Why? Because Jean LIVES WITH US. Always watching, always lurking. I'll get to that later.

But first...

Jean wasn't that bad in the beginning. In fact, she was great for almost a decade. She remembered every birthday, gave me thoughtful gifts, knew all my food allergies (no sesame, peanuts, dairy).

She even laughed at all my cheesy jokes. I thought she liked me, maybe even loved me? Maybe she did once. But that time's gone.

Paul's dad took off when he was twelve and he doesn't have any siblings so it's always been just him and his mom. So, with that info, I'm sure people expect him to be a total momma's boy.

And he is - but not that bad. They never went on mommy and son dates or anything like that. No attention-seeking calls at all hours of the night. No cooking his meals or doing his laundry.

They were normal, had boundaries, were pretty much healthy.

I don't know what changed. I can't wrap my head around the thought that she's been pretending this whole time...Did I really have it all wrong?

I can't stop going over every little interaction. Every smile and hug. Were they cold and uncomfortable but I misread them as warm and inviting?

How could I be so blind?

Maybe at some point I accidentally insulted her and didn't know it? Jean's always been laid back so it's weird that I would somehow insult her and then she wouldn't tell me. But instead quietly resent me and plot her revenge?! That's insane!

After going over everything again and again and again, I think maybe I got it, where it all started - summer vacation at Yosemite.

Three months ago the three of us - Paul, Jean, myself - took a trip to Yosemite. We stayed a few days. There was some weird snafu with the hotel booking and we ended up having to share a room.

Jean didn't care at all. In fact she laughed it off and said we could just fix it tomorrow. We ate Chinese food and went to bed. Jean slept on a cot by the window.

Paul offered to sleep in the cot while she share the bed with me but she didn't want to. I was kind of relieved, it would've been weird sharing the bed with her, I'm sure she felt the same way.

Well...

At some point during the night a bright light woke me up - a white flash coming from outside. I still don't know what it was. We were on the second floor so it definitely wasn't a car's headlights.

It was almost like the search light of a helicopter but there was no sound.

Paul didn't wake up because he's a deep sleeper. Like so deep if a bomb blew up half our house he wouldn't wake up.

It took a second for my eyes to adjust to the dark, and when they did, I saw that Jean was gone. I thought maybe she was in the bathroom but she wasn't. I figured maybe she couldn't sleep and went to the bar downstairs for a drink. She's a big girl and take care of herself.

So I went back to sleep.

But in the morning when I woke up she still wasn't back! I woke Paul up and we searched the whole damn hotel in a panic. We found her down by the pool asleep on one of the lounge chairs...in her nightgown!

It was bizarre. All of us were shaken.

But Jean insisted we finish the trip and we did. Even though there was now a dark cloud hanging over us the entire time. When we got back Paul made some doctors appointments for her - she fought it, not wanting to go, but eventually gave in.

According to the doctors she's 100% healthy, no dementia or anything like that. Maybe she was sleepwalking? Even though she's never done that before...

Shit got weirder after that...but only when it was just the two of us. Just like my Grandma did to my mom - never when anyone else could see, especially not Paul.

Around Paul she was totally normal.

I work from home doing medical coding so we're together *alllll* day :(. Usually she does her own thing downstairs while I'm working in my office. She has hobbies, she's an avid knitter. She loves gifting scarves and gloves to family and friends during the holidays.

Suddenly she wasn't knitting as much anymore. She was too busy lurking and watching me.

I noticed she started giving me weird looks, like she was studying me? And I caught her crushing up peanuts in the meatloaf she insisted on making! After that I decided I would be the only one cooking in the house.

A couple times I caught her trying to slip some sesame oil in the salad dressing, and milk in my coffee. I'm pretty sure she succeeded once because one night I was shitting my brains out in the bathroom...and I thought I heard her on the other side of the door listening.

Sometimes I'd be watching tv and out of the corner of my eye I saw her staring at me. One time I woke up in the middle of the night and I thought I saw her standing in the doorway but she slipped away before I could get a good look.

She also started asking me questions about my family - like basic info that she already knows! Every time I answered she looked at me like she caught me in lie. She knows my family, has met them many times. *Why is she asking me about the color of my mom's eyes?*

Finally I had enough and talked to Paul about it. I wanted to talk about it outside the house because I felt like she was listening and he told me I was being paranoid! He said he didn't notice anything different about her, *only* *me* - that I was being tense and weird.

Of course I was, his mother was quietly torturing me!

Eventually after a lot of back and forth he said he'd talk to her about it. But that was a lie. He hasn't done shit and I'm seriously starting to resent him and respect him less.

I want her to move out. There are plenty of good senior homes for her to live in, with people her own age. How can I bring this up to my husband without it becoming a fight?

Relevant Comments:

Comment: *Why does Jean live with you in the first place? And how long has she lived with you?*

OOP: Jean lives with us because of some problems with her house and bad loans and some other poor decisions involving money. Plus Paul didn't want her to be alone. She's lived with us for a little over a year.

Comment: *Girl you got yourself a husband problem! His mom sounds like A LOT, and definitely manipulative, but hubby needs to step up. He needs to tell her to back off, show some damn respect, or she's no longer welcome in your home! Your home is meant to be your safe place! What she's doing is just terrible.*

Comment: *This is emotional incest. Mommy wants to make your man her surrogate husband. Yuck! I've seen it before, and most times the marriages don't survive. You need to get her out - like YESTERDAY!*

Comment: *Classic gaslighting. Your monster-in-law is emotionally abusive and a real piece of work. Curious - are you Paul's first serious relationship? Wouldn't be surprised if she ran the other ladies off...*

OOP: Omg! I'm his first serious relationship! He had a few girlfriends but they didn't last over a year.

Update: October 15, 2023 (2 weeks later)

I wish there was some good news but there isn't. Life has gotten much worse. Jean has outdone herself. I think she tried to kill me.

Basically I had made some chili for dinner when I suddenly felt weird...

Long story short: I ended up in the ER. At some point Paul found me passed out in the bathroom and rushed me to the hospital. The doctors said I had a bad reaction to something I ate - could've been sesame, milk, peanuts, or all three.

Paul admitted that he searched for my epipen but couldn't find it.

I knew it was Jean and that's what I told him. We had a fight and I exploded. It was bad. I thought I might end up getting committed so I tried to calm down.

He drove me home and has been sleeping in a separate room. I think Jean was delighted by that.

God I wanted to confront her and tell her to pack up her shit and get out!

But I waited, I felt like I needed some kind of solid evidence.

So when Jean was taking a bath, I searched her room and what did I find? My epipen AND peanut powder!

*Now it was on.*

I confronted her as soon as she came out of the bathroom. I wanted to slap her but stopped myself. We were both screaming. It was terrible.

She ran off and hid in her room.

Something came over me and I found myself ripping through the house like a tornado, throwing and breaking shit. If I didn't break plates I felt like I'd break Jean's face.

Once I got through all that, I felt a tiny bit better. And then came the tears. A flood. I felt like I was crying so hard I might pass out.

What happened next is kind of a blur...

At some point I went up to Jean's room and banged on her door.

I asked why she was doing this to me. What did I do? Did she want me to leave her son? I would if that meant I was free from her bullshit. Did she pretend to care about me this whole time?

What changed? Why did she change after Yosemite?

After a couple minutes of silence she finally told me the truth. She was testing me. I asked her why. She said I was the one who changed not her.

I asked what she meant.

Apparently, that night in Yosemite with the flash of bright light, she woke up. She saw I wasn't in bed, and I wasn't in the bathroom. When she looked out in the hallway she saw me disappear down the stairwell.

And she followed me.

Once outside she saw me disappear into the nearby woods. She called my name but I didn't hear her. She tried to keep an eye on me but lost me somewhere in the dark. She panicked and made her way back to the hotel.

She thought about waking Paul up but didn't want to cause trouble. Why? Because it appeared to her like I knew where I was going. Like maybe I was meeting someone? She didn't know.

So she waited for me by the pool so she could talk to me privately but ended up falling asleep.

She claims that she tried to talk to me about it the next day and a few other times but I was...*weird*. Like I just stared at her? She said my eyes scared her - like I was someone or something else. That's what she said *something else*.

I couldn't believe what she was saying. I lost my shit again. Banged on the door, tried to knock it down, screamed like a goddamn banshee.

I'm surprised the neighbors didn't call the cops!

I banged on the door a few more times, then I remembered that I had a key. Paul had made a key for all the bedroom locks. So I ran downstairs and grabbed it from the kitchen drawer, ran back upstairs, and unlocked the door.

When I swung the door open she was ready for me. *This bitch stabbed me in the hand with one of her knitting needles!*

Shocked, I just stood there. Time seemed to slow. I felt dizzy from it all.

Jean screamed at me to look at my hand, look at my blood.

I backed away and hid in the bathroom. I cleaned my wounded hand and noticed something...my blood looked *different*. It was thick and black like tar.

What the hell?!

I blinked hard and looked down at the blood in the sink. The tarry drops looked like they were *moving*...like little worms wiggling down the drain.

I must've been hallucinating. Somehow Jean poisoned my mind.

I'm not sure how much time passed but Paul knocked on the door. He begged me to come out. He asked me where his mom was.

Jean had run away. After hours of searching for her, Jean finally called Paul from a hotel a few miles away. She told him I had attacked her and she defended herself.

Paul believed her.

Before he could have me committed I ran off. I'm using the free wi-fi at Mcdonald's to make this post. I don't know if I'll post again...

Update: November 23, 2023 (over 1 month later)

Happy Thanksgiving! I wasn't sure if I was going to post again or not. Some days are fine and some not so much. I got some nice DMs and some support so I figured I'd post an update.

I've been living in a shitty roadside motel. Sure the room's small but it's a helluva lot better than living with that woman!

Paul kept texting me, asking me where I was, saying he was concerned for me. I took some of your advice to heart and I asked him for a divorce! Then I blocked him. He can be his mommy's surrogate husband, I don't give a shit anymore.

Luckily for me my job will allow me to work anywhere as long as I have an internet connection, so I have steady income.

Today I'm gonna take it easy. I ordered some Mexican food and tres leches cake. And I rented Parenthood which is one of my favorite movies.

Oh, and my hand has completely healed. Didn't even leave a scar. I found something weird though...a mole on my stomach. Nothing to worry about I think.

I'm including a picture just in case though. *Link: photo deleted by user.*

Comment: *You need to have that looked at! Go to the doctor ASAP. I've never seen anything like that. What's that fuzzy stuff, hair?*

OOP: It doesn't feel like hair, more like moss. I'll go to the doctor when I get a chance. Is it really that bad?

Update: March 1, 2023 (4 months later)

Things went south. I'm not doing well. I got a month-to-month apartment. But now I can't afford it because I lost my job due to poor performance. They said there were three days I didn't even do work?! That doesn't make sense to me...

I'm lonely. People avoid me. It's like they can sense that something is wrong with me.

My neighbors are afraid of me. They called the cops because I wouldn't stop screaming. I didn't even know I was screaming till the cops showed up. I apologized and said I was going through a tough time.

They left me off with a warning.

Oh, and that mole on my stomach has gotten a lot worse.

I don't think it's a mole at all...*it's something else*. It's starting to take over my entire torso. I'm too afraid to go to the doctor. What if they lock me up and experiment on me?

I've decided to head back to Yosemite this summer - same hotel, same dates. I don't know why I want to go back there since that's when my life started falling apart...but it's like something's calling me back.

Update: the poster never provided an update.

One redditor found an article that may or may not be link to OOP. *Here's the link: link is dead.*

The gist: A naked woman was seen by a hotel employee walking off into a nearby wooded area in the middle of the night. They went to help her but couldn't find her. They reported seeing a bright light and what looked like a black triangle in the sky.

No one knows who the woman was. Other hotel staff say they saw the black triangle as well, and had seen it once before - *exactly one year ago*.

I hope OOP is doing okay and got the help she needed. I'm posting this hoping others might be able to provide some info on OOP or anything else strange. A few people have messaged me about seeing a black triangle in the sky - not just in Yosemite but elsewhere too.

Some of it seems legit. I've now started searching the sky every night. My wife thinks I'm crazy but maybe I'll see it too. Who knows? If I never look I'll never see it.

I'm planning on taking a trip to Yosemite next year.
