"About ready for bed, babe?" I asked, stretching after getting up from the couch. Willow turned to look at me, and I could see the sleepiness in her jade-colored eyes. Despite looking like she could pass out at any second, she began shaking her head. "Just one more episode, Jack?" She whined as she gave me her best pouty face, which made me grin from ear to ear. We'd been married for three years, and I don't think I'll ever get over how beautiful she is.

I pulled her closer to me and kissed the top of her fiery-red hair. "Another one? You could hardly keep your eyes open for the past thirty minutes. I swear I was just waiting to hear you start snoring." She giggled as she turned her head and looked up at me. "Whatever..." she said, giving me a quick kiss before standing from the couch and walking towards the hallway. I followed close behind as we made our way to the bedroom and crawled under the covers.

The bright moonlight shone through the window as I woke sometime during the night. I looked over at Willow and saw that she was dreaming peacefully. After rubbing my eyes, I checked the clock and felt relieved that it was Saturday.

"It's there..." Willow suddenly said, startling me. I looked over, but she was still asleep. She had never talked in her sleep before, and I found it quite amusing, so I decided to try and have a conversation. "What is?" I asked. She stirred a bit, briefly wrinkling her face. "The white tree, the one with black leaves..." "What?" I responded, raising an eyebrow. "I can hear it..." She said softly. I opened my mouth to ask something else, but something in the corner of my eye caught my attention. In the dark hallway past the open door, I could see the silhouette of a person. I tried to move, but found myself frozen in fear as my eyes adjusted to the darkness... and I saw its face.

It looked just like Willow, but its eyes were hollow and its hair was matted and dirty. The sunken cheeks made it seem like it had not eaten in weeks. Its whole form was almost skeletal, and it was covered by a black dress.

It didn't move, it just stood there, in the hallway. I finally managed to glance to the right and saw Willow still asleep. Her brow was furrowed, and she was muttering something softly, but I couldn't understand what she was saying.

With my heart beating fast, I reached for the lamp on the nightstand and turned it on. The room was immediately bathed in a warm orange light, but when I looked back at the dimly lit hallway, I realized that the figure I had seen before was no longer there. "What is it?" Willow said groggily, sitting up in bed. I rubbed my eyes for a couple of seconds, then turned to face her. "What's wrong, Jack?" She continued with a worried look on her face. I swung my feet to the floor and stood up, offering her a half-hearted smile. I didn't want to freak her out. "It's nothing, I think I just had a bad dream. Gonna go to the restroom," I said, walking towards the bathroom doorway. She rolled out of bed to her feet, yawning. "Hurry up, I gotta pee too."

As we went back to bed, I found myself suddenly exhausted and quickly fell asleep while Willow rubbed my chest.

When morning came, I rolled over and noticed Willow had been awake for some time. The smell of bacon and noises from the kitchen told me she was making breakfast.

How did I ever get so lucky? She was everything a man could ask for... tenfold. We went to the same high school in our little town. She was always my biggest crush, but we somehow seemed to find ourselves dating different people instead of each other. Two years after graduation, we found each other again at the local coffee shop one morning, and here we are now. I'm married to the woman of my dreams, and my whole world revolves around her.

I got out of bed and walked through the hallway to the kitchen. Willow was still at the stove, scrambling eggs. She turned and gave me that signature heart-melting smile of hers, so I walked up behind her and wrapped my arms around her waist. "Morning gorgeous," I said as I kissed her neck. She tilted her head backward and gave me a loving kiss. "Morning babe, it's almost done." I kissed her on the cheek and walked to the table, sitting in my usual chair.

"So you had a nightmare last night?" Willow asked. "I guess so, but the highlight of the night was you," I replied. "You were talking in your sleep, saying something about a tree." She furrowed her brow at that, then walked over to the table and placed a plate of bacon and eggs in front of me. "A tree?" She said as she sat in her chair. I took a bite of the bacon, leaning back in my seat. "Yeah, you said something about hearing a white tree that had black leaves." She got a puzzled look on her face. "Hmm, I don't remember..." she replied. "But a white tree with black leaves... that reminds me of a photo that my foster parents gave me. The house I moved from when I was two years old, my birth parents house. There was a white tree with black leaves in the picture." She took a bite of her eggs. "So anyway, what's on the agenda today? Have something in mind?" I asked her. She finished chewing a bite and then glanced out the window. "It's such a pretty day outside, how about we go for a walk?" "Sure, that sounds great. Been a while since we've done something outside."

Willow's parents had died when she was two years old. She was originally from Washington State, but after spending some time in an orphanage, was eventually adopted and her foster parents moved to Texas.

After finishing our breakfast, I cleaned the dishes while she folded laundry. She sang her favorite songs as they blasted through the speaker in the bedroom. I couldn't shake the image of the figure in the hallway from last night, though. It seemed so real... and there's no way it could have been sleep paralysis as I was in the middle of having a conversation with my sleeping wife.

After we finished getting dressed, we went outside and strolled down the little dirt path that circled the property. It was a beautiful day, the sun shining through the trees, and a nice breeze making the leaves rustle. Willow took my hand in hers as we slowly savored the morning.

"I've got a surprise for you," Willow said suddenly. She had a big smile on her face, and her eyes seemed to glow from excitement. "Oh really, now?" I replied, finding myself starting to smile as well. She turned away from me and gazed down the path between the trees. "But you'll have to wait until tomorrow," she said in a slightly teasing manner and then turned back to face me. I noticed that her smile had doubled in size. "You always do this..." I said, pretending to be frustrated. She knew I couldn't stand it. She squeezed my hand a bit. "Trust me, you're gonna love it, so it will be worth the wait," she assured me. A squirrel ran across the path ahead of us, climbing a tree. "Fine, but I get to pick the movie tonight," I replied, kissing her cheek.

We continued walking along the winding path, surrounded by an abundance of nature. The rustling of leaves and chirping of birds filled the air, adding to the peaceful ambiance. Eventually, we found ourselves back at the house on our cozy porch swing, swaying gently back and forth as we took in the beauty around us. We spent some time there, enjoying the tranquility of the moment before heading back inside.

We spent the rest of the afternoon catching up on TV shows as we snuggled on the couch. I went to get some snacks for the movie I picked - some new horror I'd been wanting to see - then sat back on the couch beside her. She was already looking sleepy.

"You sure you're gonna make it?" I asked her, popping a piece of candy in my mouth. She looked towards me and giggled. "All I can do is try, but I can't help it. You're so comfortable to lay on." She scooted closer to me and wrapped her arms around me, laying her head on my chest. I turned on the movie while eating the rest of the snacks, but found myself dozing off. My friends were right, it was pretty terrible. They just don't make scary movies like they used to.

I looked down at Willow, who was sound asleep with her head on my stomach. A sudden sound in the hall jerked my attention, and I squinted as I tried to make out the source of the noise. I didn't want to disturb Willow by turning on any lights, so instead I paused the movie and listened.

Down the hallway, I saw the light from the kitchen turn on, and terror immediately overwhelmed every bone in my body. The blood pulsing in my ears, I went to turn on the lamp beside the couch, but the figure in the hall made me freeze in my tracks.

My heart skipped a beat as I saw her again... the ghastly woman that resembled Willow. She was standing still in the dimly lit doorway, staring at me with her eyeless gaze. I could hear myself breathe as I wondered what she wanted from me.

"The tree..." Willow suddenly murmured, causing me to glance down at her briefly before returning my eyes to the monster. "The white tree with black leaves... I can hear it..." she continued, breathing softly. I quickly reached over and turned the lamp on, filling the room with light. The instant Willow woke up, the light in the kitchen shut off, and the figure was gone.

"Everything ok?" Willow said in a sleepy tone as she rose her head to look at me. I didn't know what to say. This was so strange, what in the hell was going on? I didn't want to cause her to worry, so I pushed my fear into the pit of my stomach and smiled. "Yeah, the movie sucked. Im just ready for bed," I told her. She put her arms around me as I picked her up in my arms and carried her to the bedroom.

As I tried to force myself to sleep, the fear I pushed into my stomach was slowly turning to dread. I couldn't fathom why, but I had an awful feeling that something terrible was going to happen and didn't know what to do. Maybe I was just going crazy. I kept trying to fall asleep, but the minute I closed my eyes I felt like something was watching me. I'd shoot my eyes open and stare at the open doorway to the hall, expecting the creepy monster that looked like Willow to be standing there. It never was, though, and eventually I managed to finally fall asleep.

In my dream I was standing in the kitchen. The house was dark, with just the faint moonlight shining through the window. I attempted to move, but found I couldn't get a single muscle in my body to budge. Suddenly a light in the hall came on, illuminating Willow standing in the doorway. She was looking at me with a sad expression on her face as she slowly walked into the kitchen, stopping just in front of me. I noticed her eyes were filled with tears, and the pain it caused me in that moment was indescribable. I tried with every ounce of willpower inside me to reach out and wipe her tears away to comfort her, but was planted firmly to the floor.

The light in the hallway abruptly went out, and I was horrified to see the Willow monster standing in the doorway, its silhouette illuminated by the faint glow of the moonlight. I watched in terror as it slowly floated towards us, my eyes frantically shifting between the creature and Willow, feeling helpless. The eyeless abomination was behind Willow now, reaching out its arm towards her as she stared at me, tears streaming down her face. She gave me a sad smile just as the grotesque creature grabbed her.

I woke up in a cold sweat, breathing heavily as my eyes darted around the room. The sunlight was shining through the window, and the sound of birds chirping could be heard from outside. I glanced over at Willow, who seemed to still be fast asleep. I decided to sneak into the shower, and quietly crawled out of bed to the bathroom and shut the door.

After walking back into the bedroom, I was surprised to find Willow still in bed. It wasn't like her to sleep so late, usually she was already up and about when I'd wake up in the mornings. "Somebody must be sleeping good," I said softly in a playful tone. To my surprise, she didn't move an inch. "Want me to make some breakfast? It's been a while since I did the cooking," I said a little louder, crawling onto the bed and putting my arm around her. But something was wrong. She felt cold to the touch. "Babe? You okay?" I asked as I uncovered her face from the blankets. My heart was immediately in my throat at the sight of her. Her lips were a purplish blue, and her skin looked a pale grey. She was dead.

"Willow!" I screamed, blinking through the tears as I shook her shoulder. "Willow, wake up!" But she wouldn't move. I wrapped my hands around her back as I brought her face to my chest, rocking back and forth. This couldn't be happening... this can't be happening... "Please God, don't do this..." I cried, teardrops falling to the bedsheets.

They told me she had suffered an aneurysm in her sleep. I felt so numb, sitting on the porch swing and staring into the distance. I sat there the rest of the day, unable to bring myself to do anything else until the sun had started to set. As I went to stand to my feet, however, I saw it. Just down the path... was the silhouette of a person. I squinted my eyes to try and see it better, and to my horror, I noticed the person looked like me. It resembled me, but in the same way the creature resembled Willow.

I stood to my feet, stepping off the porch towards the figure. "What the fuck do you want from me?" I asked it loudly. It didn't move... it just stood there, it's hollow eyes staring through me. I wanted to feel scared, to feel anything, but the only emotion that washed over me was anger as I began walking quickly towards the creature. The sun had completely set now, and the shadows danced around the trees as I drew closer.

Seemingly out of nowhere, a crow flapped past me cawwing noisily, causing me to shield my arms in front of my face. I watched as it disappeared into the trees, but when I turned my eyes back to the creature, I noticed it was gone. I stood there for a while, looking around, then glanced toward the sky. The anger inside me exploded and I fell to my knees. "How could you do this to me?" I screamed to the clouds, tears falling down my cheeks. "How could you let this happen? Take me too, you fucking bastard... I can't live without her! If you're really up there, take me too..." After a while of no response, I got up and slowly walked toward the house, wiping my eyes.

I went into the bedroom and opened the closet, pulling out a few boxes that belonged to Willow. After sitting cross-legged on the floor and opening one, I sorted through the contents, which mostly consisted of photographs of us. I pulled each photo out of the box as a mixture of emotions flooded through me. There were four pictures - one of us when we bought the house, one of me when she baked me a cake on my birthday, and one of us at our wedding.

I inspected the last picture in bewilderment, pulling it closer to my face. In the photo was an old cabin, which I didn't recognize. My eyes scanned the picture, growing wide as I saw the tree behind the house. A ghostly-looking pale white tree with twisted branches and black leaves. Was this the house and tree from when Willow was two years old? It had to be. And the tree... I wondered if this was the tree that she had been talking about in her dreams, the one she said she could hear. I turned over the picture and found an address and date scribbled in cursive on the back with black ink. I set the picture in my lap as I reached for the last thing in the box, pulling out a small black container that had a little red bow on it. After opening it, all I could do was stare at the item inside. A sob got stuck in my throat as my eyes filled with tears and the realization of what I was looking at began to set in. My arms began shaking, causing me to drop the container that held a positive pregnancy test inside to the carpet.

I sat with my back against the wall and my hands cupped over the back of my head for some time, crying loudly. My head throbbing, I picked up the black container and kissed the lid, then walked to the bed and set it down on the pillow at Willow's side of the bed. I slowly walked back to the closet and picked up the photo of the tree.

After placing the photo on the nightstand, I crawled into bed and pulled the covers to my chin. I'm not sure why exactly, but a feeling from deep down told me I needed to find the house and tree from the picture. I needed to know why Willow had suddenly been talking about it in her sleep. With everything that happened, I wondered if it was all connected somehow. It sounded crazy, but finding the tree felt like the right thing to do. I fell asleep with the light on after booking a flight to Washington State.

The next morning, I quickly packed a suitcase with clothes and toiletries and drove to the closest airport. After making it through security and waiting for my flight, it was finally time to board.

I stood from my seat and turned to walk towards the boarding area, but froze as I saw it. There it was again... standing in the shadows of a corner, staring at me with its menacing, eyeless glare. My blood turned cold as I quickly walked onto the plane, refusing to look over my shoulder.

Seven hours later after a connecting flight and short layover, I departed the airport and walked to my rental vehicle. I sat in the driver's seat and looked at the photo again, typing the address into the GPS and preparing myself for the fifty minute drive.

There wasn't much traffic, and the drive through the country helped to soothe my nerves as memories of Willow ran through my mind. I had never been to Washington State before, and was captivated by the vastly different trees and foliage.

I glanced into the rearview mirror, and an eyeless figure in the backseat caused me to slam on the brakes as I nearly swerved into the ditch and treeline to the right. My heart pounded as I jumped out of the car, backing away slowly. I stopped in the middle of the road, noticing the creature was no longer in the vehicle. I walked over and leaned against the hood, rubbing my eyes. The breeze drifted through the trees as a squirrel crossed the road, stopping in the middle to look at me before hopping to the other side. I drove the rest of the way to the house, nervously glancing back and forth between the rearview mirror and the road.

I pulled into a little dirt driveway, which seemed to continue for forever. I drove slowly around a bend, and could finally see a small cabin in the distance. It was older and more dilapidated than in the picture, but was definitely the same house.

I pulled over and parked the car at the end of the driveway, stepping outside. The sky was completely overcast, and looked like it would rain soon. I looked at the photo and noticed the tree was behind the house, to the left, just before the treeline. The gravel crunched underfoot as I started walking around the cabin.

There it was, a white-barked tree with twisted branches reaching towards the sky and leaves as dark as night. The strangest thing, however, was the obsidian-colored fruit hanging from the branches that looked like apples. Looking at the tree gave me a strange but comfortable feeling, and reminded me of Willow. Somehow I knew there was a deeper connection between her and the tree, beyond its mere presence in the backyard of her old house.

I began walking slowly towards the ghostly tree, but suddenly felt as if I was being watched again. I turned my head over my shoulder, and saw the eldritch version of myself standing near the car, facing in my direction. I felt no fear, however, as a feeling of warmth suddenly washed over me like a blanket as I finally stood beneath the tree.

"Jack..." Willow's soft voice echoed, startling me. Her voice seemed to come from every direction. I looked around, dumbfounded, but didn't see her anywhere. "Willow?" I answered, glancing up at the tree. She didn't respond. I slowly reached my hand out towards the tree, resting my hand on the pale bark. A sudden euphoria rapidly spread through my body, causing me to gasp as I closed my eyes. "Jack..." I heard her voice say again, and I shot my eyes open.

I lowered my hand from the tree, turning around, and my eyes immediately flooded with tears. I stood there, astounded, unable to move or breathe.

Standing about thirty feet away from me... was Willow. She looked absolutely stunning in a silky black dress, and her eyes sparkled like diamonds as she smiled at me. With a graceful gesture, she held out her hand, beckoning me to come closer. I couldn't resist her pull, and my feet moved towards her as if on their own.

Teardrops falling from my cheeks like rain, I slowly began walking towards her, sobbing as I quietly laughed from happiness. As I reached for her hand, I briefly saw the hollow-eyed figure of myself by the car again... but I didn't care.

I softly took her hand in mine, and she gently pulled me closer to her as my sobbing grew louder. A strange sensation surged throughout my body, causing me to sway as she wrapped me in her warm embrace. The sensation immediately grew overwhelming as I squeezed my arms tightly around her... and lost in the moment... I felt myself lose consciousness as I fell asleep for the final time.
