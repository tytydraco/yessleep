*I'm not entirely sure what to do..*

My father had just passed away, so I've been staying with my Mom since I got back to town after I got a call from her about my dad's passing. I knew she needed me now more than ever... she was *fragile*.

Losing the love of your life after being with them for more than 50 years can be more than devastating. Thus, I knew another week or so staying at the house I grew up in was more than necessary.

Fortunately for me, I still have several months to go until my next term starts. And since processing grief during a school semester didn't sound very pleasing to me, it felt like a win-win situation.

My dad was a great man; he worked as a psychologist from home for as long as I could remember, while my mom went from odd jobs to building her own small business, selling cosmetic products.

He wasn't perfect, but he did his best to be a great father and a loving husband to my mother. They had their differences like any other couple, arguments here and there. Still, they never went to bed with their problems unresolved, and I believe their understanding towards one another was what led their marriage to last long.

*Until death did them part.*

It was a rough day for the whole family, especially for my mom and me, after more than a week of going through arrangements for the funeral service, then having to go through that said service. We were beaten down the most, as one would expect.

Having to say goodbye to a loved one is never easy, and it never will be.

After the service, I stayed downstairs to tidy up. We'd left the house a mess that morning, rushing to make it to the funeral on time. I had just finished sweeping the living room floor when I noticed a pile of unopened envelopes stacked messily by the front door.

Those weren't there that morning. And neither of us noticed them when we got back from the funeral, since we entered through the garage door.

At first, I thought it was just bills. But each envelope was sealed with blue wax, stamped with an emblem of what I now recognize to be water lilies. What struck me most was the writing.

*They were all addressed to my father.*

Immediately, I took the letters upstairs to his office, laying them neatly on his desk, fighting the urge to open each one and read what was inside. I stared at the label on the first envelope; each of them had a number, which I assumed was meant for the order in which the letters were meant to be read.

Each number was written on the middle back of the envelope with black ink on parchment, folded neatly.

I had arranged them one by one, based on their numbers. I was about to leave them as is, forget about it until morning, but as I looked at my father in his framed desk photo of our family, I felt a sense of intent; his younger eyes, identical to mine, felt heavy through the picture frame, the six-year-old boy and his mother equally smiling and happy were forgotten in that moment.

As my gaze focused on the man I've known my entire life, he stared back at me, but only through a frozen printed frame, and I realized that's how it'll be for as long as I live.

I felt a pang of sorrow curl up in my chest as I let a tear or two slip. I've kept it together for my mother throughout the whole week, but now that I was truly alone with my thoughts, I was left to process the harrowing truth.

*I'll never see my father again.*

When things got tough for me and my family, *he was our rock, my hero.* He carried me and my mother through the worst times of our lives, fought tooth and nail to keep a roof over our heads, and put food on the table.

He and my mother did all that they could to survive, to set me up for a life of comfort, in a way I no longer have to struggle the way they did when one day I'll start a family of my own.

I wish I had thanked him enough, told him how much I appreciated his efforts in raising me, how he didn't need to be the perfect father, that he was *my father*, and that was more than enough.

Now I understand the sacrifices he had to make. Back then, I took it for granted. He was always there, always present; he was just... dad, and I never really imagined or even thought of a life without him.

I wish I had told him how much I look up to him now as a man. But I was never really keen on expressing myself or voicing my thoughts in person, *which ironically I got from him*.

With bated breath and itching curiosity, I sat on my father's office chair, the very chair he sat on for many years, consulting patients of all ages. I felt a sense of integrity doing so.

My fingertips trailed his name, carefully written with ink on the first envelope, before gently unsealing the letter with the wax seal peeling off the folded parchment with a dry strip.

I braced myself for what I thought was the unknown, and maybe I was overreacting; it could've just been acknowledgement letters from his associates or colleagues upon discovering his passing.

Yet even with that thought in mind, I still couldn't get the uncomfortable anticipation crawling down my spine, despite the nerves, I knew I had to read what was in the letter, no matter what it was.

*For my father, for dad.*

**- - -**

*Fredrick H.*  
*From: 'Blackbird'*

*'1'*

*'Insignificant'*

There is no other word used best to describe the feeling I had sitting in the sterile confines of that office—*his office*. The large plush maroon leather couch felt like cold rubber against my skin as I sat unmoving, observing his every move as he scribbled away on his notes, the only sound in the room being the scratch of his pen against the paper.

My mind had begun to drift aimlessly before my gaze trailed toward the curtain-drawn windows. The bright afternoon shone through the window frames, illuminating dust motes that caught my attention as they floated gently without direction. The poorly picked design of a carpet felt plush against my black leather school shoes as my feet shuffled after staying in place, causing a light tingle of discomfort.

*"Aubin D. Male, eleven years old, painter."*

His voice spoke—finally. His deep-toned voice was steady, yet calm and cautious.

*"I am,"* I replied.

My voice was small yet firm. I tried to hold whatever feigned nonchalance I could muster up at that age, as, despite how strongly I tried to carry myself, I could only do so much to hide the fact that *I was nervous and* *scared*. For the first time, I was facing a stranger by myself, who I thought was tasked to get information from me and tell my parents about the things I would say.

*'That's what therapists were, weren't they?'* I thought to myself then.

He simply chuckled at my response, flashing a half smile before glancing down as he shook his head, his eyes once more focused on his notes while adjusting the metallic bridge between his glasses.

*"When I had asked you to write down a short introduction about yourself, I didn't expect it to be so... short."*

He continued to chuckle, clearly amused by this whole situation—but I wasn't. As a matter of fact, I wanted to go home already. Even at the age of eleven, I had pressing matters to attend to. I had a painting at home, sitting—waiting to be finished, and by being forced to sit in front of a man as old as my father, it was hindering my time to prioritize what I should've been doing.

*"There's not much to say, really,"* I spoke, shrugging casually.

*"Well then, I believe getting to know someone is much better to do so in person; talking to one another is the best method of communication, wouldn't you agree?"* He asked.

I shrugged, feeling my shoulders shift within the small blazer coating my frame with dark blue linen. He stood with a gentle smile before walking towards me, while I shifted slightly, backed against the sinking couch, my legs scuffed against the dry leather until my flesh pulled taut.

*"Hello, Aubin, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Fredrick. Thank you for visiting me today. I'm sure you've had a long day, so I promise I won't take too much of your time."*

He was kneeling in front of me while he spoke, keeping a safe distance, but he extended a hand towards me, to which I could only look with cautious eyes. He didn't pry as he retracted his hand back with a slight awkward precision.

My eyes darted anywhere but at the man in front of me, from the antique vase to the lined shelves with dusted books and framed accolades, each from different occasions. Although the frames and regards changed, all but remained the same; his name

*'Fredrick H.'*

*"Would you like a cookie?"* he asked, a slow smile spreading across his lips. *"My wife makes a fresh batch every time I tell her in advance I'll have a tiny friend over for a little chat."*

I turned my attention to the mahogany end table, at the opposite end of the couch, freshly baked cookies were arranged on top of one another in a white marble plate, the warm milk looked tempting, as the drink emitted steam from the cerulean mug.

*"I'm not very hungry..."* I stubbornly said, despite the grumbling sensation in my stomach.

I hadn't eaten all day. I skipped lunch to read in the library, as the quiet space was better than crowding amongst other students, elbowing each other just to be first in line to get the fresh batch of dinosaur nuggets.

*"Is that so? How about a nice cup of warm milk? My son loves to have these before bed. Keeps him from having nightmares, he said."*

He offered me the mug, his taller frame moved to grab the drink by the handle with just a subtle shift, and an outstretched arm. I reluctantly took it before taking a sip—comfort minimally settled on my senses, the milk wasn't necessarily good, in fact, it tasted quite bland, but it felt warm—*it felt comfortable*.

*"Do you get nightmares of your own at night?"* he asked.

With the mug retracted from my lips, the back of my hand felt the warm residue as I wiped my mouth clean—I nodded.

"Do you want to talk about it?" he asked once more.

At that time, my head didn't swivel, nor did it nod. My lips parted to speak, yet I was hesitant; the words managed to slip past with a reluctant mutter. *"It's the same dream over and over again."* My lip quivered before taking a small warm sip.

*"She stands by the window, near the corner of my room, with a wet puddle on the floor beneath her feet."* I settled the mug on my lap, my palms enveloping the warm ceramic cup. *"She just looks at me. I know she can see me, she sees that I'm awake, but I can't see her, the corner is too dark."*

I had paused right then and there; I didn't look up—not once. While recalling my dream, my eyes didn't yearn to look anywhere else but at my hands and the mug—my only comfort.

*"and then I just... wake up and it's morning outside."*

That wasn't the first time I've ever spoken out about my dream. I've told my parents before, they brushed it off and said it would be best that I surrender myself and my worries to *her*. But it wasn't until I began to throw tantrums, refusing to attend school, and deterring from being the obedient son they had tried their hardest to raise, that they were forced to take action.

They threatened to send me to some religious boarding school, told me, *'If you speak of nonsense—of these abysmal imaginations, then* ***she*** *shall handle you.'* I was mortified; *I didn't want to leave home*, and I was in the process of being sent away to be ironed out as they saw fit, until Ms. Margot—*whose last name I couldn't seem to remember*—stepped in and spoke to my parents.

I was sitting outside the guidance counselor's office when Ms. Margot spoke to my parents, after I had caved in and spilled my guts out to her one Wednesday afternoon, after being sent to her office for pushing Rubert—*obnoxious little twat that boy was*—off of the playground swing, causing him to land on his chin with an awful thud.

Despite the closed door, I could hear their conversations. After Rubert's parents had left with him, their conversation shifted from silly playground fights to talks of anger management issues, mental health problems, and *therapy*.

I thought it was ridiculous. I was *eleven.* An eleven-year-old going to therapy—*a child in therapy*, that to me sounded absurd, I wasn't sick, I didn't need '*help*'. I was perfectly fine, not some broken *thing* needed fixing.

Yet there I sat on that plush leather sofa, still with my hands cupped around the warm milk that had gone lukewarm and stale, yet the heat remained on my thighs, with the imprint of the mug on my flesh.

I hadn't even noticed that Dr. Fredrick was speaking the whole time from his desk, and I hadn't noticed that he had gone back to sit in his chair to take down notes of what I had opened up to him about. I nodded with my lips humming half-mindedly to each of his questions, enough to give him an answer.

I didn't know what he briefed my parents about that day after my very first session with him, but it helped.

My parents were a bit sympathetic during the drive back home. I was treated to a pizza dinner and a night's stay in my parents' bed; for once, I got to sleep in the middle with them. Before that day, I hadn't really recalled or remembered the last time I got the chance to sleep in the same bed as my parents.

But with my little frame tucked between them, snuggled right under the duvet, I felt comfortable, I felt seen—and it was all I could ever ask for, *to feel loved*.

The sessions with Dr. Fredrick made me feel safer. I finally had the chance to voice out the things that made me feel anxious, angry, and vulnerable; his wife—*Cecelia*—would have a fresh batch of cookies and warm milk by the end of the table every week. I thought it was quite unnecessary at first, a minuscule gesture of kindness from a woman I hadn't even had the chance of meeting until the 4th week of my visits.

But over time I began associating the smell of fresh baked goods, and the comfortable taste of warm milk on my tongue to these visits, and for a while I almost looked forward to my Sunday afternoons—the trip to Dr. Fredrick's home, the feel of the cold leather couch that had a hint of old furniture must, and being able to talk about the things that bothered me for the week.

It began to feel like a comfortable routine that spanned months. The dream stopped, I would go to bed only to wake up for what felt like seconds later, and get up to go to school. I felt safe, I felt secure, I felt *normal*.

*But like all good things, that too would see to an end*.

I was seated in my usual spot that Sunday afternoon when Dr. Fredrick left the room briefly to instruct a plumber regarding the leaking pipes in the kitchen down the hall. *"Aubin, please stay put. I'll be back shortly. Finish up your snack while I'm away."*

My thumbs twiddled, fighting to topple one another in a fidget jitter, when in my peripheral vision I could see a blonde, tousled mop of hair peeking by the open doorway that was left open. My head turned to get a better look, only to catch a blurred motion retreating.

My gaze was unmoving from the very spot, the same head peeked out again, and this time, a pair of dark brown eyes that mirrored my own. *"Who's there?"* I spoke out.

The boy revealed himself, fully standing by the doorway with a toothy grin and a robot toy in hand, his knees looked littered with strips of grass and patches of dirt, his dark red shirt and cream coloured shorts were slightly disheveled and carried the same characteristics as his knees—a mess.

*"I'm Oliver! What are you doing in my dad's office?"* he asked, stepping a foot closer. *"I'm Aubin, I'm your father's..."* I trailed, I felt the word stuck in my throat, my mind opened different doors—thoughts of response, yet each outcome left a feeling in my chest too vulnerable to speak out, as I felt the shame of even uttering it out loud palpable in my chest.

*I was his patient—his father's patient.*

To be a patient is to be sick, and for me to admit sickness is to accept that *something was wrong with me.*

*"Friend."*

I managed to finish my response, though with a slight buffer; it wasn't as long as the boy who was now sitting at the other end of the couch with a perplexed look on his face, his toy then lying by his side. *"You're a little too small to be my dad's friend; his friends are old."* He spoke with a lopsided grin.

*"Do you wanna play? My friends all went home early today."* He asked as I shook my head, the boy bit the inside of his cheek as I rejected his invitation, leaving us to stare at each other for about half a minute. It seemed to me the gears in his head were turning slowly, processing my response. *"Psh. Come, since you're in my house, I'm the king!"* He obnoxiously spoke out, jumping out of his seat as his hand grabbed my wrist to pull me up with him.

In my mind, I had already made the decision that I didn't like this boy, but he was Dr. Fredrick's son, and I respected the man enough to give his son some grace—*despite Oliver making that quite difficult.*

He dragged me up to his room, a scattered mess with toy guns, robots, cars, and other playthings one would usually find in a little boy's bedroom, things I had decided at the ripe old age of eleven that I was too old for. 

Oliver invited me in, I shook my head as he scoffed grabbing me by the wrist the third time, showing me his latest collection of action figures. *"cool right? they're brand new, my dad got them for me last Christmas."* he beamed with a proud grin as I observed the plastic toy wrestler who already looked worn down, as the factory paint had slightly chipped off, with a peculiar blue stain brushed across its chest.

He looked quite proud of himself and what he had, that the initial response I had in mind burrowed stuck at the back of my throat, a part of that was when he mentioned Christmas, the very holiday every child I knew enjoyed—*the grinning towhead before me being a shining example*—but the December festivities were different for me.

\- - -

I spent most of my Christmases going to church for the midnight masses, having dinner enough to feed a family of twelve, where only three sat at the edge of the table. Uniformed servants lined up at the side of the dining room, waiting for their chance to feast on the barely eaten food—not long after, I would then lose myself to sleep.

That was Christmas for me, and up until I was *eight*, I didn't realize that wasn't how Christmas looked for everyone else. When my mother drove me home after taking me along to a museum event she had, I watched families walking to and from the town square, with its big tree and bright lights.

Parents happily carrying their children, some being held on their fathers' shoulders, others being held by their mothers. I could only watch from afar with my head perched against the car window, as I silently dream of being in their place for once—although I couldn't possibly admit that out loud.

But the previous Christmas in particular was different, for the first time, we couldn't attend the *'midnight-mass'* that was urged and obligated to be in, but instead my mother took me to the museum event she was a curator for that day. My father had proceeded with extra work in the university, knowing that my mother and I would be home late.

I roamed the museum on my own that Christmas evening, looking at the artworks and artifacts displayed around the rooms. I took a liking to the medieval section, seeing the statue horses and armored men frozen in a pose, but my mother couldn't stop raving about a particular artifact the museum was lucky enough to obtain for their maritime archeology section.

I recalled her talking to the guests about a *'ground-breaking'* historical find, before presenting the artifact contained in a glass casing. I could barely reach—barely see what was in the casing due to the crowd of people, but I caught its nameplate, what the artifact was..

*'Pelagora's Edict'*

My brows furrowed then; I didn't understand at that time—I didn't put much thought into why people were so amazed at the artifact. I backed away as an older woman got onto her knees and began sobbing, a bawling mess on the marble floor of the museum, as an uncomfortable feeling began to sit in my chest, and my eyes immediately began to dart around to look for my mother, to look for comfort.

The guests and visitors had begun to act *strangely*.

Some echoed and mimicked the older woman's movements, wailing and crying on the floor, as more and more people had gotten onto their knees, the very people who poshly drank champagne with snooty expressions, who—*for just about no longer than ten minutes ago*—judged certain paintings, reduced the artwork's value to numbers, and how it would look in their pristine blank walls.

Something felt wrong—*something was wrong*.

It didn't take long for me to leave the room, find myself amidst dinosaur artifacts, and a glowing vending machine. I skidded my way through the room before settling behind the reconstructed fossil skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex, as if the very thing could protect me from the display happening in the other room.

I sat there huddled with my knees to my chest for what felt like an eternity, until my mother found me, told me it was time for us to go home, as the event was done, and my father was waiting for us to have Christmas dinner together.

Despite leaving the museum, I still felt the unease prickle beneath my ribs while taking the steps to leave the museum with my mother. While outside as the cold evening approached midnight, I noticed the looks from the guests earlier, polite smiles, and 'thank you's while waving towards my mother, *towards me*.

*"Merry Christmas."* Someone said, as I took my final steps before heading into my mother's car, not bothering to look back, physically unable to, feeling the cold shiver trace down my small spine from nape to tailbone.

\- - -

*"Can I have my toy back?"*

I hadn't realized how long I was observing the useless toy in my hand, if it wasn't for Oliver, who was looking at me with the same cheeky grin. *"You can check out the other guys too, I just want to play with this one now, that's all."* He added with a light chuckle as I handed the plastic figure back to him.

*"There you are. I see you've met Oliver."* A deep voice spoke from behind, causing me to jolt slightly. I glanced back to see Dr. Fredrick, his taller form by the doorframe loomed over like a giant staring down at me and his son, who was on the floor with scattered toys littering the room. *"Hey, hadn't I told you to fix your room earlier this morning? I already let you skip school today."*

The boy with globes for eyes looked at his father with slight disgruntlement. *"But dad, I'm not done playing yet."* He whined.

I tuned out the rest of the conversation; the dirty carpet suddenly seemed more interesting than the banter between the two. Although the boy did get what he wanted in the end, as Dr. Fredrick told him, his room had better be clean before dinner.

He guided me back downstairs, our session was wrapping up for the day, but as he fixed the papers on his desk, with a sigh and reluctance, he spoke;

*"Your parents ordered that today would be your last session with me. I expressed to them that you were showing great improvement, that stopping your* ***treatment*** *wouldn't be advisable."*

I winced at the word he used. I didn't like being reminded that I was just a *patient*, some wayward stray that stumbled into his office to be cured from some *sickness*.

*"You're always welcome back, Aubin, if things get too tough, if the world feels as if it's closing in on you—the door is always open, and you know where to go."* Dr. Fredrick had a genuine smile on his face. For the few months since I've entered his office for the first time, he's been the only one I could go to when I felt overwhelmed.

My parents were present, but they were too focused on their jobs, to which I couldn't fault them for; I understood that's how they made a living, how they kept our lives comfortable and convenient, but everything does come with a price, and theirs came in a form of aloofness that I had to grow up with.

Weeks after my sessions with Dr. Fredrick had stopped, I began to wonder why they would stop me from seeking '*help*' if it truly had been working for me, if going to therapy had been good for me*, then why?.*

I wasn't one to ask my parents direct questions; their decisions were always final, and questioning why was simply futile. I've learned that a long time ago—to sit and be the obedient son was the only way to please them.

*But sometimes... I just couldn't bear to be good anymore.*

My mother had been apathetic lately—*more aloof than usual*. Ever since *December,* she'd been taking longer shifts in the museum, always coming home past midnight, while my father was still in his office.

It only took two weeks until the dreams had returned. I would wake up with half-lidded eyes only to see the woman in the corner, the same wet puddle beneath her feet, water dripping from her fingertips leaving wet *splats* on the carpet floor. She only stood—*staring*, as I forced my eyes to close, yet the movement felt incredibly slow, as if time itself worked against me, or an unwilling participant.

It was the same nightly routine to the point where I dreaded even going to sleep. I had asked Mrs. Licht—*an elder housemaid*—once to leave my bedroom door slightly open and to leave the hallway light on, but it was no use.

*The dream still came to get me*; I had expected it to do so, and it no longer came as a surprise. I remained still, my eyes half-lidded open as they settled to realize the door was closed again, yet this time the window was open, but my curtains weren't moving.

I observed the room, hearing the sound of the wind from outside. I felt the feeling of unease settle on my chest once more, as slowly my eyes trailed across the room, and to the corner. She was no longer there anymore, no puddle, no figure—*nothing*.

The feeling of hope was only fleeting, as soon as my eyes trailed to the foot of my bed, to see at the end a mop of wet black hair peeking out just above the frame. I felt as if every drop of blood in my body had turned cold, as my nose began to prickle with a tingling sensation. My eyes watered as my toes tightened within the covers.

Her figure began to rise, excruciatingly slow as I did what I could only do in that moment, close my eyes. It was the only way—*my only escape.*

It felt as if it took five minutes to simply close my eyelids shut from its half-lidded state, but amidst the darkness, I could see her finally—fully standing on her feet as her dark, long hair and shadow covered the majority of her face while water dripped from her pale fingertips.

Her cracked skin was visible from the light outside the window, as her dirty dress tattered in light brown stains, what must've been white at some point was now muddied with dirt and mold. Despite the darkness slowly enveloping my vision, her neck stood out to me; both sides had three gashes that exposed the black flesh beneath her dead skin.

*"****Mother*** *wishes to reclaim."*

Her voice was hoarse and felt discordant in my ears. The moment darkness enveloped my vision once again, my eyes fluttered open to be greeted by the warm morning light seeping from my curtains. I had woken up to tears-stained cheeks. I sat up in my bed, hugging my knees. Amidst the movement, I had realized the bedsheets beneath me were wet. It was settled that I had lost control of myself during my sleep.

I simply cried, I cried like the child I refused to be—I was devastatingly inconsolable for the first minute, my throat felt uncomfortable, as the strain began to wear down my wails. I cried for my mother, my father, and anyone who would listen.

Fear had its claws wrapped around my spine, but no one came to aid me—*no one was listening.*

Never had I ever felt so afraid and helpless. Despite doing my best to shut myself off as much as possible, to refrain from showing vulnerability, I simply couldn't hold on. An eleven-year-old boy can only take so much.

My knuckles had gone numbingly white as I gripped the duvet, holding on for dear life, while the tears streamed down my flustered cheeks in continuous streaks. I hadn't even noticed how my free arm had clutched the stuffed toy—the only toy I cling to, the only one I couldn't let go.

*'Arthur the Lion'*

A lion symbolizes bravery, courage, and leadership. I've had him for as long as I could remember, and in that moment, he was the only thing, *the only one*, keeping me tethered, as I had broken down to a puddle of tears.

Just when I thought no one was listening, Mrs. Licht came barging into the room—she smelled of lavender, fresh laundry, and rosemary butter—her expression contorted to worry as she enveloped me in her arms. Upon realizing I had made an accident, she simply hummed to comfort me. Not bothering to address my accident, knowing I'd be embarrassed.

Through words of comfort, she reassured me I would be okay, that she'll take care of me—*and she did*.

But with my head on her shoulders, I could only sniffle and whimper, while looking at the once darkened corner at the edge of my room now visible to the naked eye, where the woman once stood—where she usually stood, up until last night.

The window curtains flowed gently as the wind blew air into the room, the bright morning light from outside highlighted the dust motes floating in mid-air, and comfort began to seep within my chest once more. But it was only fleeting, about a minute really.  
  
As my eyes registered the wet patch on the carpet, right at the foot of my bed, I felt my stomach lurch from the inside; if it weren't for the comforting brush and pats on my small back, I would've lost control once more.  
  
I've never felt genuine fear before, to the point of being unsafe within my own skin, but in that moment I wanted nothing more than to be anyone else but myself—to claw out of my own body and *hide where nothing and nobody could find me.*
