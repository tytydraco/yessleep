I hadn't had a hit in years. But everyone always told me, from the very beginning, that's just how it went—there were always going to be ups and downs, peaks and valleys and shit, but if you kept showing up, if you just put in the work every day and rode it out, then no matter what, the fans would always have your back and you’d be all right in the end.  


*Ha.*  


It had been almost three years since the video went viral. You know the one. Even if you don’t, trust me—you do. It’s the one where the drunken washed-up country singer goes off on an  unhinged rant about how his fans are just “a bunch of inbred hicks who are too fucking stupid to see I’m just taking their money, that I’m not ‘one of them,’ that in fact, I fucking *hate* them and everything they stand for, and I’m laughing all the way to the fucking bank while they’re boycotting Bud Light or Disney or whatever the outrage of the week is.”  


It was, as many-a-media outlet put it, “not a good look.” Among the fans, it “didn’t go over well.” My career was, in the words of my ex-manager, “royally fucked.” The tour was canceled. The label dropped me. And the hangers-on who had been a ubiquitous presence in my life ever since I was twenty-six—agents, promoters, label reps, the spineless amoeba fucks who just told me whatever I wanted to hear—well, they were suddenly nowhere to be seen. And neither was my money. In fact, I was nearly broke.  


But unlike the miserable losers I wrote songs about, Colton ■■■■■ was never one to wallow in self-pity (and I swear that’s the last time I’ll refer to myself in third person.) So when I saw the house for sale—the infamous *Evergreen Estate*—I took the very last of my savings, called my realtor, and plotted my comeback. 



\* \* \*  


It was the oldest and most famous “home” recording studio in the U.S., built by none other than legendary country music producer ■■■■■■■ Evergreen. A lot of people thought that “Evergreen” was just a cute stage name, that he’d adopted it early in his career to give the impression that he had something of a Midas touch, but believe it or not, it was indeed his actual family name. The fact that everything he ever touched turned to gold was just a, what do you call it, a *cosmic coincidence.* From ■■■■ Williams, to ■■■■■■ Nelson, to ■■■■ Denver, to ■■■■■ Parton and on and on, Evergreen seemed to have a preternatural gift for drawing out the very best from the artists he produced, for forcing them to dig into their deepest selves to unearth that something special (can’t quite bring myself to say *je ne sais quoi*) that was uniquely *them*, whether it was in the songwriting or in the performance. And from the 1950s through the 1980s, he crafted hit after hit after goddamn hit, all written, recorded and mixed at his illustrious Evergreen Studios.  


The house itself had been standing since the mid-1800s, an elegant antebellum mansion with towering white columns and a wrap-around porch, nestled in a forest of ancient, moss-draped oaks. It sat perched at the end of a winding dirt road on two hundred acres of rolling hills, way out in the Georgian countryside, and yes, it was just as stunning as it sounds. 



But that’s not why I bought it. I bought it for the studio. For the console. The mics. The reverb chambers.   


*The history.*  


Now, despite what my bible-thumping former fanbase believes—excuse me, *believed*—about me, I am not a religious man. But I *do* believe in the concept of, how do I put it… *history never really leaving a place.* Like, once something’s happened somewhere, it stays there. I’m sure there’s a word for that, maybe something Native American, but it’s currently escaping me.   


That’s how I was thinking about Evergreen. It was a place with *history*. The very music that inspired me to become a singer in the first place was created there, and, I hoped, it was going to inspire me again. I thought, if I could just soak up some of the genius that might still be wafting around in that air, then maybe I could create something truly special. And if I did that, then maybe, just *maybe*—I could have my old life back. That was my frame of mind at the time. So I think I can be forgiven for ignoring the fucking copious fuckload of warning signs.   


\* \* \*  


Ok, so my life didn't go to shit *immediately* after the video. I know I *said* it did, but I was just being dramatic, another one of my many talents. Everyone stuck around just long enough to see which way the wind was blowing, and once it was apparent that it was indeed blasting with gale force towards a never-ending shitstorm of failure, that’s when they all started to jump ship.   


First it was just the social climbers—the party people, the groupies, the yes-men. Then my business manager—there was no longer any business to manage, he said—then my agent, lawyer, personal manager, assistants, and finally and most devastatingly: Abigail and the girls.   


I didn’t blame her for leaving. She wasn’t one of the wind-sniffers, she’d just reached her breaking point and was finally done with my bullshit. You see, when the train first went off the tracks, I was living in a state of denial. I thought the fans would come back. The endorsement deals. The tour offers.  


But they didn’t. And that’s when I started hitting the bottle, *hard*—not to mention various other poisons of a non-liquid nature. It wasn’t safe for our two little girls, Abbie said, their daddy coming home wasted at four in the morning, shaking them out of bed, forcing them to listen as he recounted stories from his glory years they’d already heard a million times, how he had sold out this or that stadium, broken this or that chart record.   


I don’t remember ever doing that, but I suppose therein lay the problem. I wasn’t remembering a lot those days. I was drinking so much that I blacked out regularly, and one day Abbie just said she’d had enough and told me to get my shit together. That if I ever did, she and the girls would be there. But I knew she wasn’t holding her breath. In truth, neither was I. Broke, alone, and slowly drinking myself to death, I was well aware that I’d become a walking country lyric. But like I said, that’s the headspace I was swimming in when I bought the place, and when a man’s that desperate, he sees only what he wants to see, or however the saying goes.    


\* \* \*  


Evergreen sat on a couple hundred acres way out in the middle of the Georgian countryside. Unfortunately, to get there, I had to drive through Hog’s Hollow, the bumfuck small town on Route 17 just before the dirt road turn-off to the estate.  


When I pulled my truck into the dilapidated gas station on Main, I was half-expecting to see a tumbleweed roll by. Maybe hear the faint strains of “dueling banjos” wafting from some redneck’s front porch. Alas, neither transpired, so I filled up my tank, then went inside to grab some groceries for the week. Milk, beer, bread, beer, eggs, beer… the basics.   


\* \* \*  


“Beautiful town,” I mumbled to the clerk, as I plopped my stuff down on the counter. It was not a beautiful town.   


He just stared back at me with dead, dull eyes.  


“Uh, name’s Colton, I just bought the–”  


“I know who you are.” There was an edge in his voice, as he nodded to a couple burly  men behind me I somehow hadn’t noticed. “We all know who you are.”   


My pulse quickened. So they’d seen the video. I don’t know why I gave a shit, it wasn’t like I’d have to see these slack-jawed yokel fucks very often.   


“You got somethin’ against us?” The two other men were on either side of me now.   


“I’m sorry?” I stammered. 



“On that video, you said you hate people like us.”  


I didn’t like the way this was going. “Oh, that–” I quickly threw down some cash and started inching towards the door. “Look, all that stuff was taken way out of context, you know how the media loves to twist things.”   


That seemed to satisfy them for the moment. Still they said nothing. Just stared at me.  


“Well… gotta get moving, see you boys around I’m sure,” I said, as I fumbled the door open and beelined towards my truck. I dug in my jeans pocket for my keys, surprised to find my hands shaking uncontrollably.  


“Hey!” the clerk suddenly screamed, running out the door after me. I instinctively balled the keys into my fist, ready to defend myself if necessary.    


But the clerk just held up a plastic bag. “Forgot your groceries."  


I breathed a huge sigh of relief. I could hear the other two snickering inside as I grabbed the bag from him. They knew I was rattled, and those bastards were enjoying it.   


“Huh. So I did. Thank you.”  


“And Colton,” the clerk said as he looked off into the hills, off in the direction of Evergreen, “Be safe out there.” Then he turned his gaze back on me, leaned in real close, only a couple inches from my face, and whispered,  “Keep your ear to the ground.” Then even quieter, so I could barely hear him, “*They’re most active after the sun goes down.*”  


“Uh, thanks…” I managed, then got in my truck, slammed the door, and peaced the fuck out of there.   


\* \* \*  


As I drove the long, winding dirt road out to Evergreen, I tried to put the unsettling words out of my mind. *Keep your ear to the ground? They’re most active after the sun goes down?* What the hell was this, fucking *Redneck-Alien?* Eh, he was probably just messing with me. Wasn’t the first time it’d happened since the video, and sure as hell wouldn’t be the last.   


I shrugged it off and refocused my thoughts on the mission at hand. My plan was simple: Set up my gear in the studio, do a veritable fuckload of drugs, and let the genius of Evergreen flow through me. Then I’d show up in Nashville in a couple months with my masterpiece and *boom*—the industry would welcome me back with open arms.   


And if I was lucky, my family would too.   


\* \* \*  


The moment I set foot in the house for the first time, I knew I’d made the right call. The old wood floorboards groaned under my weight, which, to anyone else, might have felt like a warning to turn back, a sort of aural “abandon all hope ye who enter here” type of thing.   


But not to me. I felt it immediately, the rush of history, the walls thrumming with creative energy. Fuckin’ place had *vibes,* is what I’m saying. Speaking of, this is probably where I should tell you about the rumors. About ■■■■■■■ Evergreen, his legendary perfectionism, his notorious temper, and of course… his mysterious disappearance. Because yes, I knew about them. And I bought the damn place anyway.   


First, there's the man himself. ■■■■■■■ Evergreen was, by all accounts, a child prodigy, plunking out melodies he’d heard on the AM radio on a single listen before he could even talk. But while he could have easily gone on to have a career in whatever musical field he chose, it was the songs of his upbringing, the native rhythms and lilts of Appalachia that spoke to him the deepest.   


He started off as a humble session hire in Nashville, playing guitar, bass, mandolin and fiddle—all equally well, motherfucker. Hell, he’d even get behind the kit from time to time if the drummer was late, or just wasn’t quite cuttin’ it. But he quickly realized that, while it paid the bills, life as a hired gun wasn’t all that creatively satisfying. ■■■■■■■ Evergreen needed more *control.*    


So he started writing songs and pitching them to artists. Songs about love. Songs about loss. The heavy shit. Pretty soon he had a pub deal, and in a matter of just a couple years, he was the most sought after producer in country music. He was the *anti–*■■■■ Rubin (the pseudo philosopher who played exactly *zero* instruments, but, through his cult-leader-self-help-guru persona was “responsible” for dozens of hits), no, ■■■■■■■ Evergreen just told you what the fuck to play, when the fuck to play, and how the fuck to play it.   


*And it worked.*   


Time after time after time, it worked, and the bastard ruled the roost for decades, churning out hits and amassing gold records like no one else had before him. But then, one crisp autumn night—October 26, ■■■■, to be exact, the night of the Country Music Awards—it was all over just as quickly as it began.   


Details are murky on exactly what happened. Some said it was a car crash after the ceremony. Some said it was an aborted suicide attempt. Some said he’d made a deal with the devil, and the time on his contract had just run out. But whatever it was, everyone could agree on one thing: that night after the CMAs, after he lost “Album of the Year” to pop-country newcomer ■■■■■ Hayes, ■■■■■■■ Evergreen was… *different.*   


His personality seemed to change overnight. He’d never had much of a temper before… but now? Seemed he’d turned outright violent. Whispers spread among musicians… backing vocalist a little flat? He’d brandish a bowie knife between takes to bring the pitch up to his liking. Bass and drums not finding the pocket? He’d fiddle with an old revolver, spinning the chamber mindlessly, like a tiny metallic wheel of fortune, until the rhythm section finally locked in.   


Soon, he disappeared from public life altogether, and retreated to the safe haven of Evergreen. There were rumors that he was holed up there like some kinda ■■■■■■ Hughes, writing music just for himself, his masterpiece, his magnum opus, never to be released… he’d spent his entire life working for *other* people, now this one was gonna be for *him.* He worked tirelessly, holding dozens of sessions for the better period of a year… but the first call players eventually got fed up with his, uh, hostile work environment, and after a while they just stopped showing up.   


So he had to scrape at the bottom of the barrel, for the ones who were so desperate for work that they’d drive the two plus hours out into the middle of nowhere to Evergreen, often in the middle of the night, play the session, and just hope to god they eventually got paid. I know it sounds crazy, but this is how the music business functions. Desperation preys on desperation.  


■■■■■■ was famous for pulling the same exact kind of shit at Paisley, but what was different about Evergreen—and it’s a sorta dramatic difference—is that the people who showed up for those midnight sessions sometimes didn’t come back. Or if they did, they were somehow *different*. Not altogether there. Like they’d lost something essential, something human.   


At least, those were the rumors.   


But as I entered the hallowed space for the first time, I put all that hocus pocus crap out of my head as far as I possibly could; I just ran around from room to room, giddy with excitement, soaking it all in. The house had been off the market since ■■■■■■■ disappeared in the 90s, so it had sat more or less completely untouched for thirty-some years. The furniture was still perfectly arranged, the dinner table still set. Hell, ■■■■■■■’s gold records were still hung in the hallway. All the place really seemed to need was a good dusting.   


\* \* \*  


I was feeling good. Inspired. Before I’d even finished unpacking, and probably against my better judgment, I decided to call Abigail. Had to wander halfway across the damn property just to find cell service, but I wanted her to know I was doing well. More than that, I wanted to see the girls. And I wanted them to know that their daddy was back in the saddle, moving towards a goal with purpose.   


Abigail picked up after a couple rings.  


“Abbie. Before you hang up—”  


“You know I don’t hang up Colton. Just tell me what you want.” Her voice sounded like silk. *God I missed it.*   


“Straight to the point, atta girl. Well. You know that old studio I always talked about? Evergreen?”  


“What about it?”  


“I bought it.”  


There was a long silence on the other end. Then an exasperated sigh. “And?”



“And what?”  


“And this is relevant to me, how?”  


“Because I want you and the girls to come for the day, check the place out. They’ll love it, there’s plenty of space for them to run wild, and you’ll—”  


“Colton.” Now it was her serious voice. “What’re you tryin’ to do here?”  


“What? Nothin’, I’m just seein’ if y’all wanna—”  


“No, I mean what do *you, Colton*, want out of this. You think we’re gonna just come out, fall in love with the place and—”  


“Abbie. I’m just sayin’, come here for an afternoon. We’ll have a picnic, watch the girls play. It’ll be good for them. No hidden agendas, no strings attached. I’ll even give you a sneak peek of what I’m working on.”  


“Well, lucky me.”



Just then I could make out the melodious squeals and squeaks of my daughters in the background, “Who is that? Is that Daddy? Is it??”  


There was a silence on the other end—I could almost hear the debate as it played out in Abbie’s mind—then finally she sighed, and said, “What do you think girls, you wanna go visit your daddy in the country this weekend?”  


The eruption of shrieks was more than enough to tell me I’d won the battle.  


“How’s Saturday afternoon?”  


\* \* \*  


That was a full two days from now, which gave me plenty of time to lay down some tracks so I at least had *something* to play for Abbie by the time they got here. I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t a little hopeful it’d be just like the old days. She’d hear my voice, hear the song, and fall in love with me all over again. Wasn’t *likely* to happen, but hey, it was *possible*, I thought, as I made my way down the spiral staircase and into the studio to set up for my first session. 



The recording studio itself occupied the entire basement floor of the mansion. There was a plush control room at the bottom of the stairs, with velvet couches and an old Neve console, a couple iso booths abutting it for tracking vocals, and a sprawling live room with vaulted arches and a Steinway grand parked right smack in the center.   


But the real crown jewel of Evergreen Studios was *below* me, buried deep beneath the house.   


*The echo chambers.*   


Now I know that may sound a bit odd, but they were fairly common features in studios from that era. In fact, ■■■■■■■ was inspired by the same ones ■■■ Paul had designed 30 feet underground at Capitol Studios in Hollywood.   


Back in the day, before the advent of plates, springs and digital effects, the only way to create reverb on a recording was to record a dry vocal in the studio, amplify it through a speaker down in one of the chambers, then mix the result back in with the original recording, which allowed the sound to blossom into this kind of a celestial wash. ■■■■ Spector famously used the technique in pioneering the “wall of sound” on countless Beatles and Beach Boys recordings in the 60s.   


Of course, that was before he went crazy and murdered ■■■■ ■■■■ Clarkson.  


\* \* \*  


I wandered from the control booth into the live room, running my fingers through a thick coat of dust on the piano lid. I was no ■■■■■■■ Evergreen, but I could get around respectably on a few instruments. I sat down at the grand piano—an ancient “A” model by the look of it—and started to play one of my old hits, a tender ballad called *“Right Place at the Wrong Time.”*    


It took me all the way to the first chorus to notice something was off. Well, actually, *nothing* was off, that’s what was so off: *The piano was perfectly in tune.* Which was strange, considering it hadn’t been played in over three decades. *Huh, the tech who set this thing up must’ve really known what he was doing*, I thought, as I got up and mindlessly picked up an old Martin parlor guitar from the corner. I rested it on my knee and gave it a few light strums: it was also perfectly in tune. *Weird.* I set it down, grabbed an old Fender P-bass. E-A-D-G… also perfect.   


*In fact, all of the instruments were.* The piano, the guitars, basses, mandolins—everything was tuned up perfectly to A440. This made absolutely no sense… instruments left sitting that long, literally for decades, in fluctuating climate conditions like Evergreen should sound like a goddamn garage band.   


I couldn't really find an explanation for it… so I just shrugged it off, ambled back into the control room, and unloaded the rest of my gear. Which wasn’t much—just my laptop, an interface, a few cables. I had sold everything except the essentials.   


As I patched the Neve console through my trusty interface and into my computer, I was suddenly struck by how quiet it had gotten. The studio was acoustically treated of course, but this felt different. Almost unnatural.   


The wind had stopped blowing.   


The birds had stopped chirping.   


*Or was I just imagining it?*   


Either way, I needed a drink.   


\* \* \*  


Several beers later, I lay awake in bed watching the shadows dance on the ceiling, thinking about Abbie and the kids. How excited they’d be when they saw the place. I could see it perfectly: Abbie and I sprawled out on a blanket under a canopy of oak trees, her laughing, throwing her hair back the way she did when she was truly comfortable around someone, watching the girls run wild through the never ending fields. I was just starting to drift off to sleep, into this beautiful dream…   


*And that’s when I heard the voices.*   


I bolted upright in bed. At first, I thought I had to be imagining things… they were so distant, barely even audible. But as I strained to listen, it became clear that they were voices alright, female, and they were *singing—*something I’d never heard before, a beautiful, lilting melody washed out in echo, as if it were being sung in a cavernous cathedral. I flipped on the light, pulled myself out of bed and staggered downstairs.   


The sound was definitely louder down here, but there were no houses for several miles, so where the hell was it coming from? My pulse raced as I looked around for something, anything, to defend myself with, eventually settling on a cast iron poker from the fireplace. I felt ridiculous, wielding it like a weapon, but this shit was getting a little weird and I wasn’t going to take any chances.   


As I crept down the dark hallway towards the foyer, the store clerk's words suddenly flashed in my mind: *Keep your ear to the ground. They’re most active after the sun goes down.*   


A chill ran up my spine. Is this what he was talking about? These voices? Just then, the melody swelled, drifting louder now through the old house, a haunting, ethereal lullaby that seemed to float just beyond the edges of reality, and perhaps, my own sanity.   


Then, without fully realizing what I was doing, I knelt down and pressed my ear to the floorboards.   


*The music was definitely coming from down in the studio.*   


I could almost hear the words they were singing, whoever they were. I tried as hard as I could to convince myself I was imagining it, as I got up and slowly padded towards the studio door.   


That’s funny… I didn’t remember closing it? My heart beat like a kick drum as I approached, like the fucking thing was going to leap out of my chest—then just as my hand touched the cold brass of the door knob—*silence*.   


The voices stopped. I took a deep breath… and shoved the door open.
