 

I live alone in a rather crowded environment, New York City. Every day I hear hundreds if not thousands of people. It gets annoying sometimes, especially when I try to sleep.

I had a dog before but because it was so loud I gave him to relatives, I still miss my little Rex. I work at a coffeeshop, so this even increases the people I see every day.

I only work a few hours till I can get back home and start reading or watching more Youtube videos, these videos are actually how I found out about Reddit. Well suddenly on October 24th this all changed. I woke up in the morning, loud as always. I went to get dressed and start walking to my work. Everything was normal there, I had to do some cleaning and checking all machines.

I went to ask my co-worker something, when I tripped and knocked a coffee out of his hand that hit an elderly man. He looked at me with a death scare. I instantly stood up and told him I was sorry. He started talking, not English, not any other language. I suddenly felt something in my body, a stinging. The man walked away slowly and looked at me one last time before he left.

I rushed to my boss to ask him if I could have the day off since my body really hurt. He allowed me to do that but told me I needed to be here tomorrow or call in sick. I agreed and walked home. I didn’t continue my normal cycle since I just fell into bed, ignoring all those noises. Next day I woke up.

Thinking yesterday was just a dream. But something changed, the normal loud noises from the people outside wasn’t there. I checked my watch thinking it was night, but no, it was 8 in the morning. I thought about the old man again. Did he make me deaf? No I can hear myself moving around my bed.

I know I wanted silence but now it isn’t as pleasant because it just changed overnight. Can that be? No it cannot be. I walked outside and checked around.

Nobody anywhere, but everything working fine. I went to my work and found nobody there. I just saw the ad’s and signs saying the name, Café-Flor.

I don’t understand this. Something is deeply wrong about this. I suddenly heard something, a screeching. I looked everywhere and found nothing. I went back home. I opened my door and checked my laptop.

It had a connection, I was able to watch Youtube videos again. I could comment too? I commented on many videos and asked for help, told them my address and asked if anybody knew what this could be.

I suddenly heard something behind me. I quickly turned around in my chair. I saw nothing except a shadow in the corner of my eye. I turned around again, I saw it again. A little shadow rushing around in the corner of my eye.

I thought I was going insane because of no human contact. I tried a few times and saw the shadow every time. I turned back again and didn’t see it. I turned around again and suddenly had a shadow humanoid in my face. I jumped out of my chair and ran down the stairs.

I tried shouting for help, because in that moment I forgot I was alone, with the shadow. This is really scaring me, who are these shadow creatures? I booted up Wikipedia and tried to look for answers there. I just found [this page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_person) which is not really helpful.

I went out again, but the screeching was there again. And suddenly multiple screeching sounds. And after that multiple shadow people.

This is just too much, I ran inside and went to bed because I was really tired of running all day. I woke up to knocking on my door. I don’t have much time left so I want to say something before they come in here.

Please tell my family and my dog I love them, if you see this report it to the police. Someone needs to rescue me, please! I'm not sure when they'll get me.
