One day, I was browsing the deep web, and like when you drive to a destination and you dont really fully remember driving there, i didnt know quite how i ended up where i did, but i found myself in this online marketplace. However this wasnt like your standard Walmart this market was infamous for selling items that were supposedly cursed. Objects that may as well have come straight off the pages of a Stephen King novel.

Well, curiosity got the better of me, I thought it might be a great idea for a YouTube video. The unboxing of a supposed cursed object was a viral video waiting to happen, surely? I didn't think twice I hit the purchase button and then sat back and waited for my item to arrive.

Heres where things get a little interesting, soon after the package arrived strange things started to happen, to be honest nothing instant or paranomal but small subtle occurances, the kind of thing that has you thinking your going crazy. Cupboards doors left open, doors left unlocked, thought you put your keys by the front door and now there on the floor in the livingroom... Don't remember turning the hallway light on before bed? I started to hear whispers late at night, so quiet it could have been a dream, during the day it would feel like someone was just always right behind me but I'd turn around and obviously there would be no one there but that feeling had the hairs on the back of my neck standing up.  

I only escalated from there, soon after the nightmares started. I would wake drenched in sweat and panting like id ran a marathon, my mind would be confused and frightened until i relaised i was safe in the confines of my bed, id calm myself down saying it was onlt a dream, only a dream but i would close my eyes and the faces, the hidous faces i would see, it was as if they were just waiting for me to go back to sleep

This may come as no surprise but I am regretting the decision to ever buy anything from that market place. I have whitnessd youtubers open boxes like this from the deep web and i took it all as foolery. I wish I could turn back the clock and stop myself from every pressing purchase, the voices get louder and more often with every passing day now giving me headaches that not even painkillers can get rid of. I try to take the object from my house to get rid but something always stops me at the threshhold, a power holding me in place, i can only compare it to sleep paralysis, you know you can move and want to move but you just cant... as the pressure builds in my head I'm forced to set it back down again and walk away, the faces visible behind every blink.

If you take anything from this story please learn from my mistake. If there is something recommended to stay away from.. stay away from it. I wanted an easy viral video instead my mind is broken, my body betrays me making me think and feel things, there is nothing for the pain and im embarrassed to ask for help
