Have you ever heard of the Grand Circus of Mysteries? You can recognize us by the large banner set up over the entrance; a circular sign with several slightly faded looking clowns, magicians, leaping acrobats and other exotically dressed performers decorating its length. A large, open circus tent sits in the background with the entrance lit up in yellow, and the name of the circus is printed out in bold and stylised letters in a semicircle above the scene. The sign is over fifty years old and it’s been a tradition for the past century for it to be erected right on top of the archway over the circus gates.

I would have hoped you'd heard of us. We’re a circus like no other. We’ve put a lot of effort into creating a special experience for our visitors from the minute they step into our circus to the moment they leave.

Your visit will be greeted with the smell of popcorn and funnel cakes and sweet cotton candy. The sounds of shrieks and screams from the rides will drift over to your ears, along with the clattering, pops and beeps of the nearby game stalls.

You’ll notice a rolling layer of artificial fog drifting out of the entrance as you walk in, from which there seems to be no source. It curls and laps your ankles as you pass through the entryway, giving you an eerie feeling. The fog leaves a light haze in the air around you wherever you go within the circus. It’s always totally gone by the time you’re leaving.

You’ll most likely be heading to the ticket booth, which is decorated with a range of poster advertisements for whatever special shows are scheduled for that day at the theatre. After buying tickets, the vaguely bored looking employee working at the cramped wooden administration desk will wish you a great time. He will direct you to read the rules (posted beside him on a large and brightly coloured laminated sign) and always follow them closely. He promises the ones at the bottom - the stranger ones you will probably want to inquire about - most likely won’t come up during your visit, and he’s right. If you didn’t know what to look for, you’d never guess there’s anything sinister concealed from view at the Grand Circus. You’d never have a clue what the rules were really there to protect you from.

Once you’ve bought your tickets, you’re free to explore our circus to your heart's content. Near the gateway and the ticket booth are the stalls; set up here are a variety of colourful stands, most stylized as wagons and each decorated with various, brightly coloured signs advertising things like ‘*Freshly Dipped Toffee Apples*’ and ‘*Ice Cream Sundaes: Soft Serve, With Whipped Cream & 16 Different Toppings!*’ - along a wide range of other circus themed foods. Some are seasonal, others are staples we are well known for, which we sell all year round.

Our food is to die for. It's one of the best parts of coming here.

I personally recommend the cream puffs or the sugar dusted cherry and lemon tarts at Tiffany’s Circus Bakery. Me and my twin sister Trinity will frequently stop by her stall once the circus has closed for the day in the hopes of getting treated to some of the baked goods she prepared that day which didn’t get sold.

Beyond the game stalls decorated with toy prizes such as stuffed animals and dusty looking puppets you will find the rides, which range from a occasionally faulty merry-go-round to the Crystal Palace Jumping Castle, to a slightly unsafe looking oval shaped roller coaster with old-fashioned sounding arcade carnival music filtering out of the entryway (it’s not really unsafe, I’ve personally been on it like a thousand times, it just appears that way due to being forty or so years old).

In the centre of the circus is the most exciting part of the grounds, the part you absolutely can’t miss visiting while you’re here. This is where the performances occur. This is what you came here to see.

To the side of a large, grassy pavilion, you’ll find a miniature outside stage lightly decorated with a large sign and lit with some flickering, multi-coloured lights. The stage sits under an open circus tent where minor, unscheduled acts occur throughout the majority of the day, such as juggling or clowning or sometimes a couple guest performances, if we can find anyone in the local area who’s up to my parents' high standards.

This isn’t what you’ve come here, though. This side show is only to get people excited to see the big events (and entertain people in between them).

The real events occur within the theatre. It's set up in the centre of the clearing, a red and white striped, oval shaped tent. The top of it rises up into a set of tall, circular towers, supported by long lines of ropes which are each decorated with rows and rows of lights.

It is (usually) the largest thing in the circus, with the peaks tipped with flags displaying our circus logo, and a sizable glowing sign supported in between the two tallest towers reading ‘*The Theatre of Mysteries, where dreams come true!*’

You most likely noticed the theatre before you walked past the circus gates. It’s designed to draw the eye from anywhere in the circus with its large size and startling colours in the day, and with the way it glows brighter than any of the surrounding rides at night, where it will be lit up brilliantly with chains of hundreds of sparkling lights.

It looks amazing. I still sometimes get a little zip of excitement when I lay my eyes on it.

Shows are scheduled every couple of hours throughout the day and into the mid evening. You get one free ticket to attend any show of your picking with your entrance into the circus (families get a special family ticket). Perry will come out of the main tent with a microphone to make an announcement when a show is about to start. The time of the show you’ve booked will also be printed out on your ticket, so make sure you don’t lose it!

We do a range of different events and our performers possess a large range of different talents. During one of our shows, you might get to see Rachael and Damien fire dancing, Morpheus the Magician and his exceptional magic tricks, or one of our unbelievable contortionists (which might possibly be me!)

Perhaps during one of our acts you might catch me and Trinity taking the centre of the stage on a lyra or a trapeze, or joining in on one of the incredible theatrical sequences. We put our hearts and souls into preparing and training for each show, and everyone who has seen us absolutely loves us, as we love performing for them.

I promise, we will be your favourite performers. Our acts are unforgettable. Literally life changing. Everyone who’s seen them says so.

I’m sure you will have plenty of fun at my circus. I haven’t gotten tired of hanging around here and this has been a second home to me for my entire life.

However, no matter how much fun you have, you’ve got to be careful not to forget about the rules, particularly the ones which are highlighted in red at the bottom of the poster at the ticket booth (these rules are also posted every ten or so square meters around the circus to make sure you don’t forget about them).

Breaking any of them is where you can get into real trouble. You could easily spend a full day at the circus and not find a single rule to be relevant. The most common events the rules warn about only come up around once every week. Others persist for a few days and show up every couple weeks. The least common are the rules I’ve never noticed cause any issues at all during the years people were required to follow them.

Don’t worry. Though some can change from time to time, they’re always very easy to follow. Here’s an example: if you’re wandering through the stalls and you happen to notice a shabbily dressed, sad looking clown who offers you drinks, you should politely decline, even if he claims they’re free. He’s not supposed to be there - I mean well he is, but you’re not supposed to be able to actually see him.

Don’t worry. He’s hard to miss. Typically he’ll give you an injured look and leave a very long awkward pause hoping you will change your mind, and the best thing to do at this time is simply to walk away. When you look back, you won’t see any sign of him, and you won’t be able to find him again if you go looking.

See? Nothing complicated about it. I don’t know who would want to buy anything from that creepy guy, anyway. This rule should be common sense, really.

You might be curious about the off-limits zone which people sometimes take note of (it's not always there, in fact, it usually isn’t), adjacent to the main stalls. This area, which the rules instruct that you are most definitely not supposed to enter, appears somewhat creepy from the outside looking in. The mist crawls thicker there, drifting up over the sides of the caravans and the makeshift storage sheds. Mannequins, unused tents and decorations, tipped over wagons and other circus accessories lie around haphazardly. Well-used and worn looking torn down stalls can be found alongside these other items; stalls which appear particularly odd and out of place, decorated with labels such as *Master Afton’s Haunted Masks* and *Madame Claudia’s Incredible Fortune Telling*, and *Interactive Puppet Shows: Mr. Chuckles and Friends*.

The section is fenced off with multiple red no entry warning signs posted nearby. The thing is, you might see someone, a figure, beckoning for you to come over to them from the other side of the fence inside the swirling, artificial mist. Their facial features and the way they lean to the side are slightly off putting, and though they are well dressed and look similar to some of the other people who work here, they are a little too tall and their smile a little too wide for them to pass off as a normal employee.

You should ignore this ‘person’. He’s like the clown I mentioned earlier. You’re not supposed to be able to see them. Once again, if you’re not trying to get yourself into trouble, this should be common sense for you. He gives me chills, so I always do my best to ignore him whenever I notice him.

Oh, and don’t let your kids out of sight while he’s visible. We’ve had one or two… Incidents where that has caused issues in the past.

Really, don’t let any of this bother you too much. There’s way too much to see and experience at our circus to get concerned about some minor safety precautions you most probably won’t need to concern yourself about.

I admit, there are other odd things people more commonly come across, which don’t require rules because they aren’t dangerous but which can still sometimes… Creep people out a bit. For instance, you may happen to notice an out of order Ferris wheel toward the back of all the rides, typically identifiable by its unusually large size (compared to all the other rides and attractions) and clear evidence of age and abandonment. If you look at one of the carriages higher up in the sky for long enough, you might notice a figure seated on one of them, half obscured from view from your position. They are typically difficult to make out clearly, and they will appear to get restless or uneasy if you observe them for too long.

Don’t bother yourself with worrying about them. The figure will vanish from view eventually. The employees will all inform you there’s nobody up there at all. They’ll point out that it’s impossible for anyone to get anywhere near the Ferris wheel (due to a safety fence being set up around it), let alone to somehow climb it and make it all the way up into such a high carriage.

I’d advise you not to overthink any of the weird stuff you see. You’re never going to find a satisfying explanation for any of it, and you’ll be likely to forget about whatever you see after you leave, anyway. Most people who have any of these types of encounters tend to lose clear recollection of them shortly following their departure from our circus. It’s just another one of the places' unusual quirks.

How do I know so much about all this myself? It’s a little more difficult to forget things when you’re like me and you work at the circus five or six days each week. When the circus is, like I said earlier, a second home to you. When your parents are the ones who own the place. People like us are different. We who work here are reminded of the unexplainable far too often to forget easily.

For most of our lives as kids, us twins weren’t supposed to talk about or even acknowledge any of the odd stuff. We were taught to pretend not to notice anything looking too strange or out of place. Follow the rules, our parents always told us, and everything will be alright. The hardest part was to not allow our ever-present inborn curiosity and inquisitiveness to get the better of us.

I’ve made the mistake of getting too curious before. I’ve broken the rules. A couple of times. As a matter of fact, I broke one of the most important rules of all. There’s another circus tent, you see, slightly smaller than the Theatre of Mysteries. When it appears (typically over the course of a week or so every couple months), it's set up somewhere near the back past all the rides and attractions, not marked with a sign yet decorated with the same softly fluttering flags and lights as the main theatre. No employee who works at the circus knows who sets up the tent or takes it down. It’s similar to the Ferris wheel and some of the off limits areas. Like them, it’s always gone by the time we’re packing everything up in preparation to move. Me and Trinity were left to come to our own conclusions as to what the tent was used for.

The most important rule is that you’re not supposed to ever go in there. It’s another easy rule to follow because the entrance will be cordoned off with a fence and there’s a stall set up nearby, selling circus merchandise. This stall may seem kind of out of place away from all the other stalls, but it's set up there specifically for a reason.

The owner of that stand is Dennis and he’s tasked with keeping an eye out for anyone getting too curious about the old theatre, if and when it appears. He is prepared to step in and make a point of getting you to leave the area if you act suspicious in any way. He’ll remind you of the rules and how you’re supposed to follow them at all times. He’ll act like something terrible is going to happen if you break this particular one. He’s intimidating enough to keep most people away and quick enough to deter the few who attempt to sneak past him.

You might be wondering how I managed to get inside, then. Well, me and my sister, like I said, we work at the circus. As kids, our parents actually ran the circus, and it’s always been like a second home to us.

One night when me and Trinity were both thirteen, we were staying late, as we sometimes do, after the circus closed for the day to train for an upcoming performance we were starring in. Well, it was two sequences, actually. Each contained different themes and musical accompaniments. They were both parts of larger acts.

We had dual aerial roles for each of them. Features of us as a duo had been popular since we started doing simple circus and magic tricks together for crowds of kids when we were ten years old.

Ellie was our trainer for the night. She's an aerialist like us and she does most of the choreography for our lyra and other aerial acts, and typically serves as our aerials teacher most of the time, since our parents are too busy managing things at the circus or rehearsing to take care of that. She’s very nice (even though she works us both half to death sometimes), and a great teacher. She always claimed me and Trinity were quick learners. I figured we inherited our skills from our parents.

Anyway, we were doing rehearsals with her one night at the central tent well past when the circus closed, practicing for the two acts which were planned for the following couple of evenings. We were expecting to finish training close to 10pm, but Ellie let us off early, telling us we were too exhausted to keep rehearsing any further and we deserved to have some time to ourselves before our parents took us back to the house we were living in at the moment.

It was pretty late - like around 9pm - and almost all other people working at the circus had already gone home for the night. Me and Trinity spent most of the time after Ellie left giggling over our phones on social media. We took a couple pictures of ourselves together attempting to do a partnered handstand. This didn’t really work out, so we snapped some more photos of us doing a couple other weird acrobatic tricks we tried to invent on the spot, which made us laugh harder because of how silly they all looked.

After that we got bored and we wandered out, deciding to go find Tiffany. She was another long-time member of the circus, and she’s always been really nice to us. To be honest I think me and Trinity considered her to be an extended part of our family, like an aunt, or something, even though she wasn’t related to us. I guess that’s the way we were raised to view a lot of the other people working at the circus, particularly our fellow performers and long time members like her and Ellie.

She’d confided in us earlier she was going to stay late herself preparing cupcakes for the following day, and she would always give us treats whenever we came over to visit her at her food truck. My favourite treat was her cinnamon dusted gingerbread and pumpkin cupcakes, which she had made quite a name for herself with over the years she worked here.

I was actually distracted thinking about these very cupcakes as we emerged from the theatre. We were walking across a grassy, shrouded field through the maze of rides, passing the warm, yellow glow of the lights of the merry-go-round and approaching the orange and red coloured fun slide, no more than a still silhouette in the darkness. It was then that Trinity stopped suddenly and pulled at my hand.

‘Hey, do you hear that?’ She asked, eyes widening.

‘Hear what?’ I asked.

‘Listen!’ She said insistently, and somewhat curiously, I obeyed. And then I heard it, what had captured Trinity’s attention.

It was carnival music. Not the kind we typically played during our performances at the theatre. This song drifted in and out of earshot as it intermingled with wind and the sounds of crickets in the background.

I looked at Trinity and we shared a nervous giggle.

‘Okay,’ I said, ‘Now that’s weird.

‘Weird and creepy,’ Trinity added. ‘I swear I heard someone talking just a second ago, like an announcer or something. Seriously.’

‘Something messed up must be going on in there,’ I agreed.

There was a pause between us.

‘We should go check it out,’ Trinity declared.

She saw the way I reacted and moved to stand between me and the tent, visible through a film of mist some distance away. She bounced up and down on her toes.

‘Come *on*, Cele,’ Trinity urged. ‘Come on, you want to know as much as I do what the hell is going on in there.’

She was right. I’d been curious about it for years. It wasn’t the first time we’d discussed breaking one of the rules, or this rule in particular. But I’d always been too afraid to actually suggest going through with it. You’ve got to understand, our parents really made us think some unnamed catastrophe would occur if any of the rules were broken. They made the idea of breaking them sound like a cardinal sin, comparable to the idea of us committing murder.

As we’d grown older, we grew increasingly to realize how little sense the rules made. More and more, we questioned why they were there in the first place, and why they were so important. I think tonight was the first time Trinity’s curiosity had overcome her fear over breaking them.

‘You really want to risk sneaking in?’ I asked.

‘It’s the perfect opportunity. Look around you, we’re practically the only ones here! No one will find out,’ she replied, ‘No one will have any idea if we just go over and take a peek.’ She laughed. ‘What could be in there that is so bad, anyway?’

I didn’t want to look afraid in front of my sister, knowing she wouldn’t let me hear the end of it. So I tried my best to imitate her boldness. ‘Yeah, screw it,’ I declared. ‘Let’s do it!’

We bounded through the silent and mostly dark rides toward the shadow of the old theatre. It rose up above the rides which encircled it. It sat positioned toward the back of the grounds we’d been set up in over the past couple of weeks. It was a dimmer, less inviting twin to the Theatre of Mysteries, which was set up in the middle of a central clearing, lighting the nearby rides and stalls in its soft, warm glow.

This tent was one of many things we weren’t supposed to talk about, something me and Trinity could get into trouble just by bringing up. My parents simply claimed it didn’t concern us.

However we’d developed several theories over the years for its existence based on what little we could learn about it. One theory was it was haunted - possibly by a performer from 1960 who died in an accident while rehearsing for a show at the circus. Alternatively, we thought it could be haunted by one of several other individuals. We knew of at least a couple of other workers and visitors who’d unexplainably gone missing at the circus over the decades.

In another theory I thought up, it was used for some inappropriate performances our parents didn’t want us to know about. Or perhaps, that they were too embarrassed to tell us about. Trinity once suggested our parents set up the tent along with other mysterious, abandoned sections of the circus and made up the rules simply to create an aura of mystery and excitement for visitors, an idea which I found compelling, though this didn’t explain why they felt the need to keep the truth a secret from us.

Over the years our theories grew progressively more creative and unusual and we had a lot of fun discussing and elaborating on them amongst ourselves.

The old theatre was set up in a secluded section of the circus, with a fence surrounding its whole length. Hanging off the supporting ropes, a few of the lights flickered faintly, leaving most of the tent visible as nothing more than a dark outline.

Unlike the theatre, this tent was not marked with clear signage. Me and Trinity had always referred to it as the old theatre because that was what our parents called it.

Only one lone stall stood nearby, where I knew Dennis would stand watch over the area while the circus remained open. Of course, Dennis had left hours ago, as he always did once the circus closed.

I hesitated when we reached the fence. The music was clearer now, and underneath it I could catch other noises; the sounds of an audience laughing, and a muffled announcer's voice like Trinity had described. The noises remained oddly distant and faint as we drew closer.

Looking at the circus tent from the outside it appeared totally empty. It was hard to imagine anyone being inside. The noises coming out of it were ghostly and muted enough to sound more as if they were coming from a speaker or radio than a real source.

As I stopped at the fence, I was confronted with an overpowering surge of apprehension. Did I really want to go through with this? I wondered. If my parents did somehow find out about what me and Trinity were doing, I would get in an unbelievable amount of trouble, more trouble than I’d ever been in before in my life. I didn’t want to think about how my parents would react to our actions.

Trinity’s impatient voice pierced into my thoughts. ‘What are you waiting for?’

My twin didn’t give me a chance to respond; she was already pulling herself up nimbly over the fence. She glanced behind her expectantly after she’d dropped down on the other side, then kept moving.

Jarred into action, I forced myself to snap out of my nervous state and moved to follow her up over the fence.

Trinity reached the tent in seconds and pushed apart the thick row of curtains which formed a makeshift entryway, while I called repeatedly for her to wait for me.

As the curtains parted, I was momentarily bathed in a yellowish glow which caused me to squint a little. Just as quickly, the curtains closed around her as she stepped in, leaving me standing out alone in the cold air.

I blinked a couple of times as my eyes adjusted to the blackness.

I called out again. ‘Trinity? Trinity, can you please answer me? Trinity, seriously! ’

I received no response. The sound of carnival music drifted out from the tent through the curtains, along with a bout of wailing demented laughter and a series of shrieks, making me shudder.

I had the unsettling sense she’d disappeared, and that if I walked into the circus tent after her, I wouldn’t find her. The idea made me feel a little tingle of dread. It didn’t sound as absurd as it should have standing out alone in the cold, dark night.

I called out again. Silence. The curtains, while closed, completely concealed whatever lay beyond the entryway. Barely any light filtered through them.

Feeling more than a little apprehension, I stepped toward the curtains and with one swift movement, pulled them open.

I had some general idea of what I was expecting when I pushed apart the screen and stepped within the old theatre. I imagined I would find a couple of performers, rehearsing some kind of special secret act I didn’t know about, like me and Trinity sometimes theorized, or perhaps performing for a small audience. I thought there might be something funny or embarrassing in whatever they were doing, though most likely not of great consequence.

It might not surprise you to know this wasn’t at all what was waiting for me on the inside.

The moment I stepped into the old theatre, the music sharpened into focus, and I could make out other sounds; wailing, distorted noises rising under the tones of the music.

The circus tent was far from empty. It was crowded and packed full of people, all turned away from me toward a stage, crammed together into rows of red, leather seats arranged in a semicircle around the stage. Most of the audience were cast in shadows and dimness, though rows of hanging, twinkling golden lights lined the walls and ceiling of the tent, and the stage was lit by larger floodlights which put everything onstage in clear view.

My attention might have lingered longer on the audience, with which there seemed to be something unsettling I couldn’t immediately place, had it not been quickly captured by the spectacle on the stage. The moment where my eyes settled there I forgot about everything else. What I saw was so absurd I could hardly believe my eyes upon first seeing it. The more details I made out, the more confused and uncomfortable I became, and yet once I started, I couldn’t stop watching.

The first performance: Brandon the Pig-man

This is an approximation of what I saw onstage when I walked in.

There were two figures. The first was a professionally dressed, well groomed man in a top hat carrying a long, pointed black staff in one gloved hand.

The second was a grotesquely bloated man. Hanging off him was a dirty garment which covered his waist and thighs. His stomach was a series of bulging folds of fat, his legs weighed down and swollen. He was stumbling awkwardly around the stage, spinning around in circles and flapping his hands wildly while he made a series of gurgling and warbling noises at the audience.

The first man - who I’ll refer to as the Showman, skipped small circles around the obese man. Periodically, the Showman paused to slap him with the instrument over his belly, back and legs, always in time with the beats of the carnival song playing. After a short while of this he deftly poked the man with the staff in the centre of his distended midsection.

The man’s eyes bulged outward and he let out a piglike, squealing sound. Some drool came dribbling from the corner of his mouth. The Showman pulled the instrument back and spun it in the air a couple of times with a flourish. The audience cheered. The showman responded by tossing his staff high into the air and catching it, then twirling it around and juggling it between his hands a couple of times.

At this time I noticed more figures joining the pair from the back of the stage. They were five assistants dressed in plain but professional looking overalls, each wearing a white comedy mask fixed in a different, disturbingly exaggerated expression.

Three of these individuals marched forward in time with the music. When they reached the fat man, they went to grab his arms and support his weight while he struggled weakly against them. Another assistant presented the Showman with an instrument which looked like some kind of long and enlarged, filth encrusted funnel. The man’s mouth was pulled wide open by a fifth assistant and the Showman, acting as if with exaggerated effort, shoved the smaller end of the apparatus deep down the man’s throat.

Two of the assistants who had left the stage briefly now came marching back burdened by an extremely oversized glass teapot with handles. With some effort, the teapot was lifted by them into the air and partially appended so the lumpy, brown mixture filling it started to spill out into the funnel shoved down the fat man’s throat. They began to steadily pour all of the thick and slightly chunky mixture into it. Judging by its size, the teapot must have contained at least ten litres of this stuff, whatever it was. The sludge popped and bubbled and it looked as if there was something, or perhaps a large number of things, writhing and wriggling inside it.

Though it started slowly, the rate of pouring increased in pace alongside the accelerating carnival music still ringing in my ears. Over time, the funnel began to fill up, and some of the mixture spilled over as the last of the contents of the teapot was being poured into it.

As this was happening, the Showman, who’d stepped aside to watch, periodically poked at the mess of liquid with the bottom end of the staff he carried to force more of it down the funnel. He persisted in doing so after the pot had fully emptied, until it looked like the funnel itself was also empty. After leaning over and examining the wider end of the apparatus, he gave a satisfied nod to the assistants. He plucked the funnel out of the man’s mouth and handed the wet and sticky tool to the nearest masked figure.

As this mixture was being forcefully fed to him, the man’s body had begun to expand, additional folds of flesh forming and his already distended stomach bulging further outward. Not once did he throw any of the liquid up, though it certainly appeared that he wanted to, gagging, retching and heaving violently once the teapot was taken away. I seriously didn’t understand how he didn’t vomit most of it right back up, given the sheer quantity he’d been forced to consume. Even for his great size, I couldn’t imagine all of the liquid in the pot fitting within his stomach. I did notice he looked substantially larger and fatter than he did prior to the force feeding taking place.

As the assistants disappeared with the pot past the stage curtains, the Showman began poking the fat man again, eliciting more of the same reactions the man gave the first time the Showman did this, and further sounds of amusement from the crowd of onlookers. The Showman was treating the man like he was an animal, I thought, and the man acted like one, too. The whole thing all felt a little too real to be just a part of some performance. Of course, everyone else - except for possibly the fat man himself - was acting like it was one.

This process repeated several times. I came to realize the assistants took the pot offstage each time to refill it. The man being force fed steadily got fatter and fatter every time the feeding occurred, gaining at least twenty pounds with each round of the process.

By the end of the third round he couldn't stand up anymore, and even four assistants struggled to support his weight. The countless, multi-layered folds of flesh which had developed and the full extent of his unnaturally distended abdomen have made him look barely recognizable as human.

Each time in between the forced ingestion of the sludge in the pot, the Showman used his staff to poke and prod the bloated man, and each time the responding wails from the man became louder and more shrill, until they sounded bestial.

The audience reacted to all this with increasing enthusiasm, cheering the Showman on, applauding in the small intervals where the Showman turned to look or motion at them.

After only a couple more minutes of this, the man’s skin stretched and ballooned out to a comical extent and the extra layers of flesh which had formed on him were no longer sufficient to support the additional mass he was gaining. His head looked tiny sitting atop his massive, bloated body. He was clearly sick and was incredibly weak, hardly responding to the Showman’s taunts or the audience’s jeering.

He didn’t offer any resistance the next time the funnel was shoved into his mouth and down his throat. During this round of force feeding, the centre of his belly slowly darkened to a bruised and sickly purple, and thin, snaking veins of blood became visible beneath the skin. At that point, the simple act of breathing was clearly a great chore for him. His bald head was glistened with a layer of sweat. His eyes had rolled to the back of his head as it lolled limply to the side.

The process of poking him resumed once again. The fat man seized up every time the Showman’s staff prodded him. His lack of any further reaction disappointed both the Showman and the audience, so he poked him harder, and then the fat man raised his head and projectile vomited a mass of chunky blood and gore onto the stage. Noticing the satisfied response from the onlookers, the Showman’s eyes lit up and he twirled his cane in the air in another celebratory arc.

Once the crowd settled down, the man’s mouth was forced open and the funnel inserted in one final time. His chest heaved and his arms quivered and spasmed as yet more of the liquid in the pot was forced into him. I could see the dark veins of blood spreading steadily over the entire length of his abdomen and legs. With every passing moment the deep, crimson stains spread more rapidly, covering a large part of his torso as they thickened and darkened.

In the middle of this latest session of force feeding, the man’s belly burst open with a wet popping sound. Blood and meat splattered all across the stage, some pieces making it to the front rows of the audience. I saw several of the parts of the man’s insides on stage flopping and sliding around, as if they were agitated by the sounds of the crazed and excited audience members, some bursting open in the process and spraying further pieces of gore everywhere. I cringed away and bit back a shriek. Thankfully, I was much too far away for any of his remains to reach me.

The audience loved it. The front rows who had just experienced the man’s insides splatter all over them cheered the loudest. The Showman bowed several times, himself somehow having managed to keep entirely clean of all the gore splattered about him. The assistants began to drag what was left of the fat man off to the curtains, several pieces of his insides slipping out in the process and joining the trails of blood and viscera left over as he was dragged away.

Right as he was being tugged behind the curtains, I heard him release another choked wail which was quickly silenced with a few sharp commands from the Showman as he followed the assistants off the stage.
