I was always a weird kid. My family considered me abnormal for being able to talk with entities that don't exist. At the time I figured it was just my imagination but over the years I have found that I have been able to see things that should not be seen. I don't tell other people because I know they'll think I'm insane. For instance, it can be pitch Black but I can glimpse another side of this reality to find something overly bright and thus I'm able to navigate my way through a setting what should in all cases be lethal. Other times I have been able to convince spirits to calm down or interact with unsavory types in the ethereal realm. I just consider it a quirk of my upbringing but that's a question for another day, namely what am I and who raised me but on to the story at hand.

It was a beautiful summer day and with the school year ending, I had decided to the woods with a few friends and initially the journey was pleasant. The leaves were in fall and the wind was not exactly cold but slightly chilly. It was on our descent into the woods that one of the more daring of our friends found a house in the back of the woods. I expected a dilapidated cabin with rotting wood and roaches or worse, but imagine my surprise when I found that the interior was nicely furnished.  It was almost too perfect. There were pictures of an older woman and a younger girl which we assumed was her daughter.

I grew suspicious but my friends wanted to explore. I tried to warn them and tell them to keep it down because we didn't know who would be here. Unfortunately they're a bunch of potheads and they don't really care about toning down the volume. Within 2 minutes, one of them was off having sex and the other two were smoking a joint. I don't know how I made it through high school with these people but I managed but that's a story for another day.

I didn't know it then but we were walking into hell itself. The boards of the house were old and creaky despite the newer furniture and polished interior. I wondered why the floorboards were so horribly maintained when the rest of the house looked amazing. My friends have decided to take a look around but I had my suspicions, after all this house should not look so immaculate and yet so decayed at the same time. None of the other houses I looked at previously resembled that at all even if they were old. They were all burnt down shacks or decayed and dying relics of the past. I decided to go upstairs and check the bedroom. As expected, the bed was haphazard and broken, with bits of wood and glass strewn everywhere. The others were still downstairs oblivious to what I've seen but something bad must have happened. The cabinet below the bed was open and I could see the spent remains of revolver bullets. There were only two and my senses immediately went on alert. Remember when I told you that I'm able to see into the veil? Sometimes it's not voluntary. I could hear somebody whispering in my ear and I turned to see an old woman and a slightly younger woman next to her. They mouthed something but no words came out. I didn't understand what they were saying but they kept punching and gesturing for me to look at the drawer. All I saw was blood and a Bible. Then they disappeared but I decided to search the room more and found a chest which upon opening I found what I was looking for.

I found a stack of old notes in a drawer in the bedroom. They didn't have a return address and the envelope was old and Dusty. It kept referring to someone named Wilkes but I don't know who that could be. Nobody has lived in this house for centuries and unless the woman and her daughter are alive and on their way back then there's no way that this house should have had a resident. I opened the first letter and began reading:

"Dear  Marcia Annette Wilkes, I hope this letter finds you well. I just received news that I will be off to the front in 3 days. We've gotten news that the Germans are about to launch an assault on the Somme and reinforcements are desperately needed. I hope that you and our daughter are doing okay. I trust you got the package I sent you? It's probably the last thing I'm going to be able to send you, packages won't be able to be delivered due to the coming storm. You're still not messing with that book are you? Don't do so, it's bad luck"

I kept wondering what book she was talking about and the only thing I found was an old Bible by the bed. It had every page torn out save one: repeated mentions of the devil and not one mention of Jesus Christ. In fact every page with a single reference to angelic or divine protection was ripped out. This greatly unnerved me but I put the fear away. I continued reading the rest of the letters: 

"Dear Marcia, I have been critically wounded and will not be able to see you or your daughter. The bullet did not go clean through and the Germans overran or position. But that's not the worst of it, we keep hearing stories of a monster in the trenches. It feeds on human flesh Marcia and it is already killed half of my unit. They sealed the rest of the men in and I got out but I'm bleeding heavily and I don't think I will get home. Stay safe sweetheart"

The letters after that were blank but they were all addressed to the same person. I kept pondering what this mysterious beast was when I heard a creaking underneath the floorboards. I also no longer heard my friends nor could I hear their voices. Instead I heard a shallow raspy breathing of something inhuman and held my breath for the longest time, eventually passing out from fear. 

I awoke in a police station with my friends nowhere to be found. I was grilled by the police officer for information as to what the hell I was doing there in the middle of the night in a restricted area. Of course I didn't know all of this because nobody told us. I told the governing officer as such that we had no idea it was a restricted area. When I mentioned the letters and the picture of the mom and daughter, what he said made my jaw drop:

"Son I hate to break this to you but nobody's lived in that house for centuries save for some squatters. Apparently something happened in the middle of the night and their bodies were disposed of. Over time the house was rented to more and more people. We kept getting the same calls of something in the middle of the night making noises below the floorboards. It was some sort of raspy choking breath but nothing ever came of it. You didn't go in there did you?"

I didn't say anything. The hair on my neck was standing up as I realized that I had almost been that creature's dinner. I asked a final question regarding the matter. 

"Officer, I found these letters mentioning a beast found in world war I by her husband. He said he was off fighting in the battle of the Somme and was mortally injured. All the other letters were blank. Is there any record of what happened to him?"

The officer shook his head and spoke again: 
"I don't know what to tell you but I do know this, Marcia Wilkes never had a husband and there's no record of her ever having a husband. But... Wait you said you found the letters in the bedroom? Was there a Bible on that bed?"

I looked at him quizzically but said yes. His brow furrowed and he became as if one dead, his face a pale reflection of his incoming horror. He grabbed a book of town records and found M. Wilkes. He pores over it and over it and over it again before looking at me in abject terror

"Jesus christ! Whatever is in that home was not Marcia Wilkes. It says here that Ms Wilkes was born July 9th 1875 and died July 7th 1891 what with having a Christian burial and all. It also says that there was never a husband and there was never a daughter. You said that you saw framed portrait. I signed off on those papers, it turns out that those people were the previous owners of the house but it doesn't make any sense unless..."

I really didn't like where this was going and my nerves rattled even more after he spoke:

"It's possible that Marsha may have lied or found a way to prolong her life. I've heard stories of people being dragged underneath the boards. Horrid horrid stories. Whatever dark ritual she took part in, that house is a hot bed of demonic activity. If she is alive then I'm so sorry but there's nothing I can do for you. I did check the House's history however but..."

At this point I was getting sweaty and my palms were clammy. I was having a near panic attack. It wasn't going to get any easier but I tried to breathe as the officer continued:

"There's no record of a renovation or any other cleanliness that you described. That house has been condemned for years. It's possible that you may have glimpsed the veil if that's even possible. It's been said that certain people can glimpse into other realities to see what was. Unfortunately whatever creature or creatures reside in it will be able to sense The entity doing so. They are able to hijack dreams and follow their chosen Target. There's nothing you can do, there's no way you can run and nobody will be able to see it to help you. I'm so terribly sorry that you had to go through this but this town is cursed and we've known for a while, we just didn't know that it was possible for people like you to even exist"

I am giving a recollection of the events from my bedroom because I know that going to sleep will be the end of me. I have taken my pills, I have said my prayers and now I have but one last thing to do before the rope shall catch my fall. Oh that I had never found that horrid cabin. There are worse things than death out there, may God have mercy on my soul. 

What you guys think?
