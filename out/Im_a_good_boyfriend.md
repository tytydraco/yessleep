Part 1.

I know what people think of me.
 They think I’m broken. Or dangerous.
They don’t understand.
I’m not a monster.
 I’m a good boyfriend.

I first saw her outside the pharmacy on Oak Street.
 She was carrying a paper bag and scrolling through her phone. She bumped into someone, dropped her receipt.
 I picked it up for her.
She smiled.
 Just a little smile.
 But it stayed with me.
It meant something.
 It had to.
I trailed her home that evening.
 Not to be creepy — just to make sure she got there safe.
 She walked with music in her ears, barely looking around. So unaware.
 Anyone could’ve hurt her.
 She needed someone to look after her.
That’s what boyfriends do.

Her name was Madison.
 I learned that from the label on her pharmacy bag.
 Madison Grey.
Nice name.
 Clean.
 Warm.
She lived in a little brick townhouse near the park.
 Unit 4B.
 I walked past it three times that night. The curtains were closed, but the lights were on.
 She was home.
 Safe.
That should’ve been enough.
 But it wasn’t.

At first, I only watched from across the street.
 A car. A bench. A shadow.
She always kept the same routine. Work, coffee shop, home.
 She’d heat up microwave dinners and binge true crime shows.
 Ironically.
On Tuesdays she watered her plants.
 On Thursdays she did laundry.
 On Sundays she took long showers and sang to herself.
I liked that.
 That was ours.
 She just didn’t know it yet.

I broke in for the first time a few weeks later.
She left for work at 8:15 sharp.
 Took a Lyft. Didn’t lock the window.
 That wasn’t safe.
I didn’t take anything.
 Didn’t mess anything up.
 I just wanted to look around.
Her couch was soft. Her throw blanket smelled like lavender.
 I sat for a while. Imagined her curled up next to me.
 Watched a few minutes of her show before I left.
It felt right.
 Like I belonged there.

Eventually, I stopped leaving.
I’d be inside when she got home, tucked behind furniture or crouched in closets.
 She never noticed.
Sometimes, I’d crawl under her bed and listen to her breathing.
 Other times I hid in the kitchen cabinet.
 Once, I fell asleep inside her laundry hamper.
She walked right past me, brushing her teeth, humming her little songs.
She was beautiful.
 Radiant.
 Mine.

There were close calls.
 Once she paused mid-step, sniffing the air.
 Another time she stared too long at the half-used coffee cup I’d forgotten in the sink.
She mumbled, “Weird...” and kept moving.
She never really saw me.
 But I saw her.
 Every inch.
I watched her stretch before bed.
 Read on the toilet.
 I knew which side she parted her hair. Which lotion she liked. What time she scratched her thigh in her sleep.
I knew her.
 Intimately.

I started leaving her little things.
 A rose on the nightstand.
 A chocolate on her pillow.
 One morning, I laid out her favorite sweater and leggings. She wore them.
That meant something.

The accident happened on a Tuesday.
 The last Tuesday.
I was cooking dinner — chicken parmesan. I’d set the table.
 Candles. Napkins.
 Two plates.
I was so excited to finally introduce myself.
She came home early.
 Walked in, dropped her purse, and froze.
 Eyes locked on mine.
“Who the f— WHAT THE FUCK?!”
I smiled.
 Held up the plate.
 “I made your favorite.”
She screamed.
 Grabbed a lamp. Threw it at me.
I tried to calm her down. I told her I loved her. That I’d been here for weeks. That I knew her.
She ran for the door.
 I chased her.
 I grabbed her arm.
She slipped.
Her head hit the corner of the countertop.
 Hard.
The sound was horrible.
 Like cracking a frozen watermelon.

She didn’t move.
Blood leaked from her temple, down her cheek, into her ear.
 Her eyes were open.
I froze.
 Stared.
 Tried to lift her up. She was heavier than I expected.
I carried her to bed.
 Tucked her in.
 Whispered that everything would be okay.
 That we were just having a fight.
She’d get over it.
 She’d always been so quiet anyway.
I kissed her cheek.
 Still warm.

She didn’t eat for days.
 Didn’t speak.
I read to her.
 Brushed her hair.
 Told her jokes.
But she just lay there.
 Still.
 Silent.
She must’ve been mad.

The smell started on day five.
I sprayed her with perfume. Lit candles.
 Opened windows.
At night, I’d curl up beside her.
 I didn’t mind the cold.
 Love keeps you warm.
I told her about my day. About the shows I watched.
 I told her I forgave her for screaming.
 She didn’t know what she was doing.
 People panic when they’re overwhelmed by love.

One morning, I woke up to find her hand had fallen off the bed.
 Stiff.
 Blackened fingers.
I gently tucked it back under the covers.
I told her she needed to rest.
 That she looked tired.
She didn’t blink.

Eventually, I knew it had to end.
 Even the best relationships can go sour.
I told her I was leaving.
 That I’d always remember her.
She didn’t say anything.
But her jaw had been open for days.
 So maybe she was trying.

I packed my things and left the next morning.
 Walked home.
 Turned on the TV.
And there she was.
Madison Grey. 29 years old.
 Found dead in her apartment.
They said there were no signs of forced entry. No witnesses.
 A photo of her smiling filled the screen.
 God, she looked beautiful.
The reporter called it a tragedy.
 Said the killer was still out there.
I sat on the couch.
 Shaking my head.
“This world,” I muttered. “This world is full of sick people.”
I looked at her face again.
“If I had stayed… maybe I could’ve intervened. Maybe… you wouldn’t have gotten killed.”
I wiped a tear from my cheek.
 “But it’s too late now. And even though I’ll always remember you…”
I smiled.
“I found someone new.”

Her name is Amy.
 She works at the coffee shop near my building.
She smiled when I ordered.
 Her nametag was crooked, so I fixed it for her.
She laughed.
 Said “Thanks.”
That meant something.
 It has to.
I know what people think of me.
 But they don’t understand.
I’m not a monster.
 I’m a good boyfriend.
