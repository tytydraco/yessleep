Me and my friend Alex rented an apartment to look for work here in the big city. Luckily we found one, we both worked as personal drivers for these two rich entrepreneurs. Not long enough I got fired, it's because I woke up late many times when my boss had to work early and he had enough of it. Alex also got fired a week later after he got caught drinking and even left a can of beer in his boss' car.

Now we are having second thought whether to go home or stay for awhile in our apartment. Our decision was made when Alex met this cute girl named Jenna. She often goes to our apartment and I decided I'll be the supportive friend in their relationship. We decided we will stay for another month. They need to have physical bond for a few more days before they enter the long distance relationship.

Jenna was so kind. I don't find my situation awkward because they are letting me be a part of their bond sometimes. I don't feel like a third wheel.

However there was one red flag about Jenna - she didn't want us to know where she lived or who were her relatives. She said she'll tell us once we gain her trust. Like duh, we know we're reckless enough to get fired from our jobs early but it's not like we're criminals or something.

One time they were relaxing and cuddling in the couch. Their discussion led to the crime that happened few days ago in a place just few blocks away from our apartment. The serial killer only kills young people. Alex joked that the killer probably only wanted smooth thick skin rather than the wrinkled ones. Jenna laughed but with a mix of cringeness.

One Friday night we went to a club. Alex watched Jenna danced in various styles. Crowd cheered as Jenna showed off her dancing skills. She did hiphop, ballroom, ballet, but the one that stood out for him was her robotics. He laughed and clapped at that dance step the most.

Alex made a plan to have a movie marathon with her. He bought popcorn, cola, and a new soft blanket.

"Oh look. A jobless man buying stuffs for his girl. How romantic." I joked but it's also a warning to him to not spend too much. I'm worried for my buddy here.

The doorbell rang and Alex opened the door excitedly. Jenna was jolly and smiley as usual. She threw herself in the couch and Alex moved the bowl of popcorn closer to them.

"I saw your boss this morning. He's classy and cool as usual." She said and Alex turned his head towards her.

"Oh, my ex boss. But can't you see that the coolest guy in the universe is right here in front of you?" He kissed her.

"Haha. I dunno. But I love your boss for some reason. Something about him makes me wanna hug him." Alex and I looked at each other. We were speechless.

The movie marathon turned out alright. They laughed, cuddled, observed the characters, it was ok.

The next morning Alex was getting ready for some walk. He grabbed his small bag and wore a cap and said he'll be off for awhile. I was still half-asleep and I groaned. "Ok ok. Bye." I said without energy and went back to sleep.

2 hours later after I showered, Alex came back. He took off his small bag and slammed it on his bed. He took off his cap and threw it aggressively on the floor.

"Jenna don't know who I am! She asked who I am!" He walked around the room. His forehead wrinkled.

"I saw her in a coffee shop. I called her and... and she looked at me and asked who I am. I told her to stop joking around but she walked away. I kept calling her but she ignored me and... and continued to walk angrily like she's shooing me away. I was humiliated. I... I don't know what's wrong with her." He's losing it. He took a deep breath and sighed.

"Do you think she has a mental health problem?" I asked, trying to show a possible answer to the situation that might comfort him.

Alex tried to call Jenna but she didn't answer. He began acting irritated and angry all the time. But eventually, he forgot about Jenna and moved on. "I'll find a better woman. Someone who isn't mentally ill." He said.

We went to a coffee shop where he last saw Jenna. This place didn't seem to traumatize him after that incident. I realize he's emotionally stronger than I thought.

A woman in her 60s greeted us. "What will you have, fellas?"

"I'll have matcha and he will have... what do you want, man?" I looked at the menu. "I'll have the red velvet." It's my first time seeing a red velvet coffee but I wanna give it a try. Between me and Alex, I'm the one who loves to order the unfamiliar ones.

"Here you go." The kind lady distributed our coffee and Alex joked at her. I didn't hear clearly what they said to each other but I found out they were close. After the lady walked away Alex whispered to me.

"Her name is Ms. Benn. She's my boss' ex." He sipped his coffee after saying that. I almost spat mine.

"W-wow. Your boss is filthy rich and a good-looking old dude. That lady's probably a hot babe in her prime."

His eyes squinted and he shook his head. "Now you're sounding like Jenna. He looks average to me. Anyway, they used to work together when they were younger, before my boss became successful. They were experts in machines and anatomy and stuffs. My boss may be married now but she on the other hand, she haven't moved on. She still loves him."

It was night time and we talked about going home to our hometown. Our mission to find a permanent job here didn't end well. We prepared our things and rearranged the furnitures and other stuffs back to their original places.

Alex's phone rang. It was Jenna.

Alex pushed his bitterness aside and listened to Jenna's cry.

"Jenna... she's... we have to go there. She's... she's with Ms. Benn. They live in the same address. What the hell." Alex was shaking and can't focus steadily when trying to grab his car keys.

We drove for like 6 minutes and after Alex parked his car we immediately got out. Ms. Benn's door was open and without hesitation we went inside.

"My mom, sh-she's going nuts." Jenna was crying and Alex hugged her.

"No I'm alright! It's you who is the problem!" Ms. Benn's voice startled us. And as we looked in the same direction I wasn't expecting something disturbing. Ms. Benn's face and shirt were covered in blood. My body froze.

Alex tried to get closer to her slowly. I can see he's nervous.

"H-hey Ms. Benn. It's me, Alex. C-calm down. Are you hurt? Why is there blood?" I can see he's scared to get any closer. He stopped and slowly stepped back.

"Call 911." Alex told me silently. I grabbed my phone and started dialing when Ms. Benn suddenly attacked Jenna.

They fell on the floor and Ms. Benn slapped her and banged her head on the floor many times. Loud thuds can be heard and she did this with great force and speed. Alex came to rescue the young woman but Ms. Benn kept pushing him away. Blood was now oozing from Jenna's hairline down to the forehead and the floor was now stained with it too.

Alex finally pulled Ms. Benn away and pushed her aside. Jenna tried to stand up slowly and I helped her. More blood trickled on her forehead. I hold her arms and checked up on her. Her head swayed heavily. Her neck looked too bent like her bones got broken. I heard cracking sounds and I can see horizontal black line appearing on her neck. What happened next was something I wasn't prepared to see.

Her head fell off.

It rolled on the floor leaving a trail of blood. Her eyes still wide opened and her face got covered with strands of her hair wet with blood.

Alex saw that. He shook and stumbled backwards screaming. I just froze there with the body lying in front of me after I slipped it off from my grasp in disgust.

Ms. Benn just stared at it in disappointment and sorrow. Alex was still screaming, his hands on his head.

As I stepped backwards in shock still trying to process the disturbing severed head I tripped on something. Another Jenna. 

I fell down in shock. I stared at it in a long pause. It was lifeless and missing both lower legs. Something was strange about the insides of the legs. I can see silver-colored parts but the rest of the parts were obviously red flesh.

The police came and checked on everything. I can hear panic everywhere and some of them vomited. They asked me, Alex, and Ms. Benn some questions. After an hour they arrested Ms. Benn for murder. The crime wasn't the death of Jenna, but the death of the past victims she killed.

When the place went quiet I saw Alex sitting on the porch. He was looking at nothing, no expression, but I can see his eyes were still teary. On his lap was Jenna's head. He was stroking her hair. I didn't talk to him and gave him time to come back to his senses. I don't wanna bother a grieving man.

I wandered around the backyard trying to calm myself from this mess. There was a cabin behind the house, I got curious so I stepped in. Luckily I don't need to find the switch of the light because it's already on.

The cabin was made of wood but I can smell more metal and oil. There were old photos on the wall. A lot of them were photos of children from magazines or stolen from real families, or maybe I'm just being judgemental, they could be her relatives. One photo showed a young Ms. Benn holding a baby and she looked so happy. The photo next to it was a bit cringe, Ms. Benn was clearly hiding a huge balloon inside her shirt and someone wrote on the photo with a marker pen saying "I'm pregnant!"

I looked around and saw more photos behind me. One was a photo of Alex's boss and the right side of it was ripped off. I assumed his wife was next to him in this photo and Ms. Benn ripped her off.

Next to it was a photo of the two of them together. Ms. Benn and Alex's boss looking so comfortable around each other. They looked like they were in their 20s.

Alex's boss, without beard, without wrinkles, less weight, and with longer hair - he looks like Jenna.
