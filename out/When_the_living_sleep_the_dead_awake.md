The sun bleeds copper over the Philippine highlands, casting long shadows over the dead.  


Billy Reyes, a man more scar than skin, trudges through the ash-swallowed world with a limp and a rifle that hasn’t spoken in days. His breath is shallow, measured. He listens to the silence. The world no longer groans or cries; it holds its breath.  


The air tastes of metal and ghosts. Like burnt circuits. Like old blood.  


He used to count the days since the war—the chemical drop, the sky split open, the cities weeping black. He remembers fire swallowing Manila. He remembers people clawing at their own faces. Now, time is untethered. Days don’t pass anymore—they pile up.

He walks because stopping means remembering. And remembering is dangerous now.

Keep moving. Don’t trust lights at night. Never speak to the ones who wander with empty eyes.

He’s starving. The last can of beans went three days ago. His side is wrapped in gauze that reeks of pus and stubborn life. Every step tears at the wound. But pain is proof. It means he’s still inside his own skin.

Then—smoke. Not from rot or ruin. Cooking smoke.

He crests a ridge and sees it: a village.

Still standing.

Solar panels glitter like fallen stars. Children chase one another in courtyards swept clean. A woman—an actual woman—waters tomatoes in a raised bed lined with charred earth and rusted shrapnel.

Billy stops breathing. Something cold coils in his gut.

“This is false,” he whispers. “This is bait.”



He waits for signs of the Hollow. For broken bodies mimicking the living. For twitching limbs or weeping sores. But there’s only… life.

Eventually, hunger overrules caution. He slides the rifle behind him and walks toward the gate.

The guards don’t flinch. One of them, a man with sunburned cheeks and a too-easy smile, greets him with a nod.

“Name’s Billy Reyes,” he says. “Veteran. Not a threat. Just need rest.”

The man eyes him, gaze flitting over the bloodstained gauze and cracked lips. Then he opens the gate.

“We don’t turn anyone away,” the man says. “But remember: when night falls, you stay inside. No exceptions.”

Billy frowns. “What happens at night?”

The man only says, “Doors stay shut.”

Inside, the town is too intact. Too normal. And that unsettles him most.

There are murals on the walls—stylized suns and vines twisting around old government logos. Solar arrays line the rooftops. Lanterns flicker with real light, not firelight. Homes are repaired, not scavenged. Children recite something at sunset near the statue of a man whose name is worn smooth by ash and weather.

Billy eats warm rice and fish. Real food. People nod politely but keep a kind distance.

A medic named Marisol tends to his wound. Her clinic is sterile—an impossible word these days. It smells of eucalyptus and ethanol.

She hums as she stitches, slow and steady.

“You sleep soundly here?” he asks, voice thick.

“We follow the rules,” she says. “Lights off at sundown. Doors locked. No exceptions. It works.”

Billy nods, though something about her eyes tugs at him. Kind, yes—but too still.

That night, he lies awake on a cot inside a guest house. He listens.

The village makes no sound.

Then, past midnight: a scrape. Fingernails on wood.

He rises, peeks through the shutter. The smiling guard from earlier is at the door, his face slack, mouth slack, eyes gone to milk.

He claws slowly at the frame.

Billy grips his knife and waits until dawn.

Come morning, the man is gone. Cheerfully sweeping his porch, whistling a tune.

“How’d you sleep?” he asks.

Billy doesn’t answer.

The days pass, and Billy observes.

The village is called San Isidro. But few ever say the name aloud.

He watches them at twilight. Every home has a ritual. Some whisper prayers. Others place garlic or salt beneath thresholds. At the central plaza, they ring a brass bell seven times as the sun touches the mountain.

He finds old plaques in the town hall.



Project EUNOIA: Cognitive Stabilization & Containment Initiative

Est. 2041 | Ministry of Health & Memory



A neural field generator. Originally experimental. Designed to suppress "nocturnal episodes" triggered by exposure to cognitive toxins—chemical weapons that didn’t just kill, but rewrote the mind.

When the war ended, what was left of the government abandoned the projects.

San Isidro endured. The solar field kept EUNOIA online. Kept the villagers sleepwalking through nights they’d never remember.

They built rituals around the forgetting. They called it The Gentle Sleep.

He speaks to a teacher, an old woman who teaches children from redacted textbooks.

“We tell them monsters live in the dark,” she says. “It keeps them safe.”

“But the monsters are them,” Billy says.

The woman doesn’t answer. Just adjusts her shawl.

“Better to believe a lie that holds than know a truth that unravels.”

He begins to understand.



They do not not know. Not entirely. But they choose to forget. Every day, they choose it again.

In a hidden room beneath the town archive, Billy finds the last true records.

Video files. Grainy and colorless.

A man—white-eyed, half-rotted—consuming a goat in a trance.

A child waking from sleep and writing equations in blood.

A woman tearing her own face open the moment someone screams her name.

A final log:

“The infection is not biological alone. It’s narrative. A memetic structure embedded in perception. The only defense is dissonance. If they do not know, they cannot transform. Awareness equals collapse.”

Billy swallows.

He finds Marisol again.

“How long have you known?” he asks.

Her face changes.

“A while.”

“Why don’t you turn?”

“I do,” she says. “But I remember. Not all of us are so lucky.”

She shows him her journal. She locks herself in each night. Wakes, reads. Reminds herself who she is. Who she was. Each morning is a decision: don’t break.

Once the truth settles, she says, it infects the soul.

But secrets fester.

A boy finds footage in the archive.

He shows a friend. Then another.

It spreads.



A woman sees herself in a clip—slithering across a floor, gnawing a dog’s bones.

A man wakes to find his own voice whispering from the radio: “You are not you.”

They panic. And panic cracks the mask.

By noon, five are dead. Two Hollow. One burned herself before it could begin.

The mayor tries to restore order.

“No more digging. No more asking. Trust the system.”

But the myth has broken. The ritual undone.

The village crumbles.



Panic clings to everything. Every eye is a threat. Every smile is hollow.

Billy isolates himself in the archive bunker. He flips through data logs, trying to find something—anything—that could hold the neuro-signal stable. But the solar grid is unstable. The EUNOIA pulses grow weaker with every blackout. The system wasn’t designed to last this long.

And then—memory strikes like lightning.

A fragment from another life. A map. A briefing. His old CO: General Lim, hunched over a projector in a Manila bunker before the skies burned.

“There’s a fallback relay west of Benguet. Old decon lab. Built to serve as a redundant uplink in case EUNOIA’s primary tower failed. It’s got its own grid—diesel-fed, EMP-shielded, low-signature. Blacksite-grade. Keep that in your damn heads, boys. If everything else goes dark, that relay stays hot.”

Billy hadn’t thought of it in years. Had filed it away with the rest of the war.

But now…

He unrolls a faded map from the wall and traces the route with a trembling finger. Two valleys over. Maybe forty klicks on foot. Through Hollow territory. Through dark.

If he can reach it—and if the relay still functions—he could reinitiate a hard-link to the neuro-frequency array. Reboot the suppression field. Stabilize the village’s mental drift. Buy time.

Or buy truth.

He stares at the map until the lines blur. Then folds it carefully, presses it to his chest.

He finally understands.



He readies to leave. Packs water, the journal, a flare.

At the gate, Marisol finds him.

“You won’t make it,” she says.

“I won’t be myself,” he says.

She gives him a syringe.

A serum. Unstable. Black as ink.

“If it works,” she says, “you’ll stay aware.”

“And if it doesn’t?”

“Then you’ll die a monster.”



Night falls.

Billy injects the serum.

It burns like ice in his veins.

He screams—low at first, then primal. His spine arches, tendons snapping like violin strings. Bones crack. Not all reset.

His left eye bursts in a spray of red. Skin around his jaw splits from the force of reforming muscle. Fingers elongate, joints bending wrong. Nails blacken and curl.

But he doesn’t lose himself.

Not fully.

Somehow, his mind stays tethered—by memory, by rage, by need.

He lurches into the woods. The air is full of Hollow howls—wet, gnashing, close.

They sense him. Not as prey. Not as kin. As something else.

One charges from the treeline—a child-shaped blur with an inside-out face and hands like sickles. Billy crushes it against a tree, the impact caving in its ribcage with a sound like wet paper tearing.

He doesn’t stop.

His feet leave blood in the dirt—his blood, leaking from burst blisters, from the open wound at his side that’s now a rotting mouth whispering gibberish.

He bites down on his own tongue to stay awake. Spits chunks of it out. Keeps going.

By the time he reaches the old lab, he’s half-crawling, dragging what’s left of his left leg, the bone visible like ivory glass beneath the shredded meat.

The relay tower looms above—skeletal, rusted, but intact.

Billy collapses at the terminal.

His hands—clawed, trembling—slam the override. He mutters the codes through what’s left of his jaw, lips slurred, teeth loose.

The lights flicker.

A low-frequency pulse hums through the mountains.

And then,

The world tilts.

The scream that leaves him is not human.

His spine finishes what it started. Snaps backward. His back erupts in ridges. Vertebrae pierce skin like knives.

He presses the final command.

And finally,

He lets go.

His eyes glass over. Blood leaks from ears, from eyes, from the ruined wreckage of his mouth. His body collapses in a heap of twisted limbs and steam. Still twitching. Still smiling.



In San Isidro, the pulse from the relay hits like a storm.

At first, there’s silence.

Then, a collapse.

Dozens of villagers drop where they stand, hands clutching temples, eyes rolling back. Children seize in dirt roads. Elders bleed from their noses. The signal doesn’t soothe; it shatters illusions.

Because now… they remember.

They remember what they’ve done.

Who they were after sundown. What the laughter masked. What the locked doors never truly held back.

Some scream. Others claw their own faces, as if trying to dig out the knowledge before it roots. But most—most just kneel. Quiet. Broken. Awake.

The Hollow are gone. Slain by daylight, by the pulse, or by their own unraveling. Those who remain are not clean, but conscious.

Marisol stumbles out of the clinic, a hand clamped over her mouth. She finds Billy's journal on her doorstep—delivered by a boy with ash under his nails and blood in his teeth.

Inside: notes on the serum. Schematics of the relay. Final entries, smeared in red.

"If the mind holds—light might follow. If not… bury me with teeth filed down."

It takes her three days to reach the lab.

She finds Billy where he fell. Or what’s left.

The corpse is unrecognizable—twisted, burned from inside out, tendons stretched like violin wire. But the smile is unmistakable. A human one. At peace.

She sits beside him and weeps until dusk.

Back in the village, the changes come slowly.

Gone are the false smiles. Gone are the songs sung to hide the screams.

They bury their dead now.

They wall the clinic with notes—reminders. Each morning, survivors read the truth about themselves before stepping outside. Some shatter. Others endure.

No one pretends anymore.

They call the village Liwanag now—"light" in the old tongue.

They still lock their doors at night. But not out of fear.

Out of respect.

They whisper a new rule before dark, not as comfort, but as covenant:

“The truth won’t save you.

But it might set you free.”
