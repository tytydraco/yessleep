It all started like any other morning. My routine is the definition of mundane: wake up, make breakfast, brush my teeth, pick out a decent outfit, and double-check my pockets before leaving. Nothing special, nothing unusual. I locked the door behind me and headed to my favorite café, a place where I can sit quietly for 30 precious minutes before work consumes me.

At 8 a.m. sharp, I arrived. My usual spot was waiting for me—a small table by the window where the sunlight barely reached. I lit a cigarette and leaned back, ready to enjoy my caramel macchiato.

Then the new waiter approached.

“Good morning, Mr. Mill. The usual?” he asked, smiling.

I blinked. “You’re new here,” I said, smiling back but feeling a hint of unease. “How do you already know my name and order?”

“It’s my job, Mr. Mill. I have to know my customers,” he replied politely, his smile unwavering.

Something about him unsettled me, though I couldn’t put my finger on it. He was pale and looked tired, his deep brown eyes shadowed and sunken. His smile felt… forced, like he was trying too hard to seem normal. But I shrugged it off. Waiters at these places always try to be overly friendly.

He brought my macchiato, and I nodded my thanks, watching him blend into the rush of the morning crowd.

The day went on as usual—work was busy and predictable, a blur of monotony. By the end of my shift, I was drained. Tim, my chatty coworker, asked for a ride to work the next day, and though I hesitated, I agreed. He always talks too much, but I didn’t have the energy to say no.

On my way home, I stopped by the Mexican restaurant my wife and I love to pick up some takeout. As I handed over my payment, I froze.

The cashier was the waiter from the café.

“Mr. Mill! Good to see you again,” he said, smiling that same strained smile.

I forced a laugh. “Well, look at you, tackling multiple jobs,” I said, feeling my voice waver.

“See you tomorrow with the usual,” he replied as he handed me the bag.

“Yeah… see you,” I muttered, leaving as quickly as I could.

That night, my wife and I shared a quiet evening with our food and old movies. I told myself the encounter was just a coincidence, nothing to dwell on. By the time I fell asleep, I had almost convinced myself.

But the next morning shattered that illusion.

My routine was the same—wake up, brush my teeth, and head out to pick up Tim. He was already waiting when I pulled up, leaning casually against the curb.

Except it wasn’t Tim.

It was him.

The waiter. The cashier. The man.

He was wearing Tim’s clothes, Tim’s watch, even mimicking Tim’s cheery demeanor. He slid into my car like nothing was wrong, flashing me a grin.

“What’s up, Mill?” he said, his voice perfectly matching Tim’s.

I felt my stomach drop. My hands gripped the wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white. “You… what are you doing here? Is this some kind of joke?” I demanded, staring at him.

“What do you mean?” he asked, looking genuinely confused.

“Get out. I’m waiting for my coworker,” I snapped, my voice shaking.

“But… I am Tim,” he said, his tone so casual it made my skin crawl.

I didn’t know what to do. My mind raced for an explanation, any explanation, but nothing made sense. Finally, I swallowed my fear. “Alright… Tim. Let’s go,” I muttered, starting the car.

The drive to work was unbearable. He talked nonstop, just like Tim would, but every word felt wrong. My skin prickled, my chest tightened, and I skipped my usual stop at the café, desperate to end the ride.

At work, he stepped out of the car and walked straight into Tim’s cubicle, chatting with our coworkers like he belonged there. My colleagues didn’t bat an eye.

I couldn’t focus. My heart raced, my palms were clammy, and my thoughts spiraled. Was I losing my mind? Was this some elaborate prank?

I stumbled to my boss’s office, barely able to string words together. He looked up, startled. “Mill, you look terrible. What’s going on?”

“I… I’m being followed,” I stammered, the words spilling out before I could stop them.

His brow furrowed with concern. “Do you want me to call security?”

“No,” I said quickly, shaking my head. “I just… I need to go home. Please.”

He hesitated before nodding. “Take the day off. Get some rest.”

I fled the office without another word, drove straight home, and locked the door behind me. The house was empty—my wife was still at work. I went to the bedroom, slammed the door shut, and collapsed onto the bed. My heart pounded in my ears, drowning out every other sound.

I lay there, trembling, trying to calm the storm inside me. Minutes stretched into hours. Finally, exhaustion overtook me, and I fell asleep.

When I woke, the alarm clock told me it was morning. I sighed in relief. It had to have been a dream—a long, twisted nightmare brought on by stress.

My wife’s arm wrapped around me, soft and familiar. I turned to kiss her good morning, and my blood turned to ice.

It was him.

The waiter. The cashier. The man who pretended to be Tim.

He lay next to me, sleeping peacefully as if we’d done this a thousand times. My throat tightened, and a scream tore from me.

“What are you doing here? Get out of my bed!” I yelled, scrambling away from him.

He stirred, blinking groggily. “Mill, what’s wrong? It’s me. Your wife.”

“No… no, you’re not,” I whispered, my voice cracking as I backed into the bathroom. My stomach churned, and I vomited into the sink.

When I looked up at the mirror, I froze.

The face staring back wasn’t mine.

It was his.

I reached up, trembling, to touch my reflection, tracing the unfamiliar contours of my new face. My breath caught in my throat as realization dawned.

I had become him.

And he had become me.
