I was always told I was a special kid. I think everyone is told by their parents that they are unique but this is a different kind of special. I wasn't allowed to go to school like everyone else. I was the neighborhood kid that no other kid wanted to play with. At the age of ten, my social skills were near non-existent. I DID however have loads of imaginary friends and they were always with me. Mr. Bones, Prollo, and Lurch. Mr. Bones is what you'd expect a child to make out of such a name; a classic skeleton with a monocle and a British accent. Mr. Bones did everything my father couldn't. Unfortunately he was not around very much and always looked scared of me. Prollo was a big pile of goop. That was the only thing I could call it, there was no defining features and he honestly was just there for comfort like Mr. Bones. Lurch however was a bodyguard of sorts. Opposed to the other two, Lurch was quite large and always stood behind me. My protector stood at 10 ish feet and was a lanky praying mantis.

There were others that came and went but these three were always there no matter what. When I go to sleep they're the last thing I see and when I wake up they're the first thing I see. As I said before, my father was rarely around but my mother was a prominent figure in my life. She always told me I was her special boy and that one day I would accomplish great things. Mother was always such a bright light in my dark nightmare of life but even shrouded in light, shadows seep through. SHE was the one who sent me to live with them. My mother sent me to what I call The Compound.

The Compound is a large building, so large that you could not see the top if you were outside of it. It was an endless tower of concrete and sadness, trapping other "special" being inside of it as a sort of anomaly prison. I was on floor 312 but I dont know how high it goes. Maybe one day I will go higher, or maybe I'll go lower... I try not to think about it too much. The way the building works was explained to me when I arrived but that was quite a long time ago. The higher you go the more dangerous you are and the lower you go the less dangerous you get. There is no one on the first floor because "every establishment needs a reception desk" as if making jokes like that would make me any happier to be taken from my home. Other than that, I was sent to my room and never saw that man again. I don't know if he works here or if he is the boss or if he is the CEO for christ's sake, I know nothing.

What I do know however, is that the people "stored" here are not ordinary and that there might be some merit to what my mother always told me, even if I don't know what my ability is. It is unfair to call this place a prison which is why I don't, but most of the people here are not fond of it and have started to call it the "Power Prison". I know I keep talking about the other people... I should probably get to them. Okay so there are 10 other people on the floor with me but I will talk about my three favorites on account of the fact that I haven't talked to anyone else yet. My most favorite inmate to talk to is Jose. I can't remember his last name but we don't really use first names here either. We go by sort of codenames like we're superheroes, I used to like it when I was a kid but now it just confuses me. Jose's codename is Irrigator. Ever since I came here Jose has used his powers everyday. He can secrete water from his veins. This sounds like a cool ability to have but there is no way to get the water out unless you have a hole in your body because there are no open veins.

Jose is a trypophobia nightmare. For most people, he is awfully hard to look at due to the holes all over his body. I don't know how old he is but he claims he's always had this and that all the blood in this body has been replaced with water. This was hard to believe at first but blood would be coming out of these holes if he was lying. There was never any blood, only water. Jose was my favorite because he was easy to talk to and whenever someone was thirsty he would let them fill their bottle from an orifice of his. I've only seen one fight here and it was Jose and Block. I never saw Block after that... at least not whole. Him and Jose were playing chess and there was an argument. Block tried to calm Jose down but he couldn't deescalate the situation and ended up with his head filled with water until it popped like a water balloon that was on the hose too long.

My second favorite is Porcupine. I don't know his real name, he never told me and I don't think he ever will. He calls me son and treats me like I'm his kid. We watch TV together and sometimes he tells me stories from when he was a kid. His power is probably pretty obvious from his name but he has spikes on his back. He told me they were bone but I hope not because that sounds painful. He doesn't get in fights with anyone and acts like a boss for our floor. Not a boss but a manager I guess. He asks me weird questions on occasion but I never know what he's talking about. Porcupine can shoot his spikes from his back as well. I think that's why everyone listens to him, he says that I'm dangerous but I'm honestly quite scared of him. I wonder who he's talking about when he asks about my other friends

My last friend is Miss Galaxy. She is so pretty, even prettier than my mother. She likes to talk about existential things and always lets me do her nails but she gets the same thing done every time: planets. Miss Galaxy's real name is Sharon but I think Miss Galaxy is a cool codename and she even gave me my  codename. She calls me Dreamweaver. I still don't know why but apparently it has something to do with my ability. I wish I knew what it was. Oh right, Miss Galaxy's power. She can channel the power of each planet in our solar system in a different way. The only ones I've seen her do are Pluto, Mars, and Saturn but someone told me Earth is what got her in here. I know Pluto shrinks her for 24 hours, Mars gives her laser eyes and Saturn makes a forcefield around her. Miss Galaxy always sets up a movie for us to watch on Fridays but it always has something to do with space(We're trying to broaden her selection).

Well those are my friends. Let me know if anyone has any questions or if you guys want me to talk to more people...
