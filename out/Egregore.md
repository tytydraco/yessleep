Decay and rot — physical, emotional — they feel the same. Only now I’ve started to think maybe it’s not decay at all. Maybe it’s transformation. People call it breaking down, but something always grows out of what dies, doesn’t it?

Courtney says I’ve changed. That I’m distant. But she doesn’t see what I see. The world’s been quieter lately — not silent, but watchful. When the wind moves through the trees at night, it feels like it’s choosing what to touch. I used to find that idea unsettling. Now, it feels almost… comforting. Like something out there finally sees me, even when she doesn’t.

We’ve been together for years, but lately, everything feels like repetition. Her patience has turned into pity; her love sounds more like apology. She keeps saying I’ve lost my faith — not in God, but in us. Maybe she’s right. Or maybe she’s just afraid of what happens when things change.

I used to tell myself I was fighting for us, but I think I was just fighting the idea of losing. I can’t stand losing.

She walks into the bathroom without a word, steam curling around her like smoke. Her reflection in the mirror is soft, dreamlike, the kind that looks like it could vanish if you blink too long. Mine feels sharper, carved out of something heavier.

“How’d you sleep, sweetie?” I ask, my voice too even. I’m watching her eyes in the glass, not her face.

“I slept okay,” she says, but her reflection lags — half a second behind the sound. “How was work last night?”

“It was fine,” I say, smiling. “Just tired.”

The silence between us isn’t new anymore. It’s a third presence — not absence, but pressure. She’s been praying more. Every night. Sometimes I wake up and see her sitting on the edge of the bed, whispering into her hands, that old Bible resting in her lap like something fragile. I don’t hate it — not the way I used to think I might. I just… don’t understand how she still believes so easily.

Still, I tell myself to be patient. She’s trying to save what’s left. Maybe I am, too. But every time I see her fingers tighten around that book, I feel something shift under my ribs — not anger exactly, more like jealousy. Like she’s reaching for something that isn’t me.

Over lunch, she says it gently: “I just don’t feel that connection anymore.” Not that she doesn’t love me — just that she can’t keep pretending everything’s fine.

I nod, trying to look calm, but her words ripple through the air between us. For a moment, it feels alive — the air, the quiet, even the space separating our hands. She doesn’t notice. She never does.

“I’m trying,” I tell her. “I know I’ve been off. Work’s been… strange.”

She nods, distracted. “It’s not just work, Jacob. It’s everything. It’s like you’re somewhere else even when you’re right here.”

“I’m still here,” I say, but it sounds like I’m convincing myself.

That night, I try to make it right. Dinner. Her favorite movie. The fort in the living room — blankets, candles, the whole thing. A reminder of when things were simple. I want her to see that I still care, that I’m still the man she married.

When she gets in the car, her hair’s loose, soft around her face. She looks tired, but kind — the way she always does when she’s already forgiven me for something I haven’t said yet. And for a moment, I remember what love used to feel like. But it’s mixed with something else now. Possession. A need for her to see me the way she used to.

“I’ve got something planned,” I tell her, smiling. She looks at me like she wants to believe it’ll fix things.

But she doesn’t understand that what’s broken between us isn’t meant to be fixed. It’s meant to be remade.

The house glows dimly when we enter. The smell of garlic and bread hangs in the air. She smiles — a real one — and wraps her arms around me.

“Thank you, sweetie. Everything looks great.”

I freeze. Because I know she means it. And somehow, that hurts more than anger would. That soft tone — it’s pity disguised as love.

“I know it’s not much,” I manage. “I know you want more.”

She shakes her head. “No, Jacob. I just want you.”

Her eyes flick toward the pantry. The door hangs open a few inches. I don’t remember leaving it that way. But I don’t move to close it.

Later, I hear her scream.

I find her in the bedroom, Bible pages scattered like fallen leaves. Some are torn. Some wet. The edges blackened, faintly smoking as if from a candle’s kiss. The air smells sharp — like metal and something older.

She turns to me, horror twisted into fury. “What the fuck did you do, Jacob?”

“I didn’t—” But it sounds wrong, too practiced.

Her face hardens. “Of course you didn’t. You never do. It’s always something else, isn’t it? Always something out there.”

“I wouldn’t destroy that,” I say, stepping forward. “You know I wouldn’t.”

“Don’t,” she warns, voice shaking. “You hate that I turn to God when I can’t reach you.”

“I don’t hate it,” I say quietly. “I just don’t know what you’re reaching for.”

She looks at me like she wants to believe that — but then something flickers in the mirror behind her. Just a shimmer. When I blink, it’s gone.

Her breath catches. “You’re scaring me.”

“I’m not trying to,” I whisper. “I just want you to see—”

“No,” she interrupts, backing away. “You want control. That’s all you’ve ever wanted.”

Her words land heavy, and for a second, I think I feel the house respond — a low groan, almost like breathing. Neither of us moves.

Then she throws the Bible at the wall. It hits with a sharp crack, pages fluttering down between us like white ash.

“Get out.”

I don’t move. My pulse is in my ears. “You wanted change,” I say quietly. “Now you’ve got it.”

The silence that follows isn’t empty. It feels aware. The pantry door creaks.

I turn toward it slowly.

Something waits there — not seen, but sensed — breathing in time with mine
