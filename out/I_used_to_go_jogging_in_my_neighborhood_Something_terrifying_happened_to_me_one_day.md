Okay, so I’m not exactly sure where I should even begin with this. It’s been almost a year to the day now that I…*experienced* what I did. And in that time, I’d almost managed to convince myself completely that it hadn’t been real. “It was nothing more than your overactive imagination, Harry”, I told myself day after day, “One of those nightmares that seems so real, they stay with you for a long while, brought on by a traumatic experience. That’s all it was” And, alongside a few stiff drinks when my own words occasionally failed to convince me, I slowly began to forget. I slowly began to let it go and return to life as normal.

  
Until yesterday, that is.

  
You see, I’m someone who is very much into exercising. When I quit smoking three and a half years ago, I decided to pour all my newly freed time and energy into getting fit. Not at first, though. It was only after I noticed that I was rapidly beginning to gain weight. I stepped onto the scale one morning to find to my shock that, for the first time in my life, I had gone over two hundred pounds. That decided it for me. I set about picking up a cheap pair of running shoes from *Wal-Mart*, grabbed an old pair of track pants from my closet, and began walking every day that I could. At the time, I wasn’t in the best financial situation, so instead of getting a gym membership, I chose to use the neighborhood I live in for my workout. For roughly an hour or so every day, I’d wind my way through the residential streets before returning home with a sheen of sweat covering my face. Slowly but surely, I felt myself begin to feel better, and happier, as I lost the weight. As I did, I moved on from speed walking, to full out jogging. And unless I had something to do, or I was kept inside by the weather, I never broke my routine. 

And more to the point, despite the fact my neighborhood had a bit of a reputation for being a little seedy, I always felt safe when I went out. The people I saw were always friendly, shooting me nods and smiles as I passed. And nothing ever bothered me.

  
That was, until last spring.

  
When I first woke up that morning, everything seemed as it always was. Nothing more than an average January day in the Pacific Northwest. According to the weather app on my phone, the temperature would stay roughly in the low 50s; perfect for an exercise. And after scarfing down a bowl of *Raisin Bran Crunch*, banana and yogurt cup, I quickly brushed my teeth and began to get ready. I dressed, slipping into my running shoes as I pulled my jacket from the closet and slid it on. Finally, I snatched my house keys from their hook, slid my driver’s license into the pocket of my sweatpants, and picked up my iPod, headphones and sunglasses from the arm of the couch before unlocking the front door.

  
A chilly blast of air struck me as I stepped outside onto the second story landing of my apartment building, causing me to turn my collar up to shield my neck. Locking the door behind me, I quickly descended the stairs and took a moment to simply breathe in and listen. The smell of the Pacific Ocean filled my nostrils, causing me to let out a contented sigh. A few blocks down, I heard a dog begin to bark from someone’s backyard, along with the droning sound of somebody mowing their lawn. As I turned to begin stretches, a loud buzzing sound came from overhead, and I tilted my head up to catch a glimpse of the orange underside of the Coast Guard helicopter as it zoomed over me. A small smile flickered across my lips as I quickly stretched, slipping the headphones over my ears and the sunglasses over my eyes. Holding the iPod up so I could see the screen, I slid my thumb around the wheel until I found what I’d been looking for, then clicked. A moment later, my ears were filled with the sweet, sultry sound of Diana Dors as the Golden Age of Hollywood actress began to sing *A Kiss and a Cuddle*. I shot one last look behind me at my apartment and the parking lot.

   
Then, I set off.

   
The cool air felt nice against my face as I jogged, the slight wind blowing my hair back out of my eyes as I headed for the far end of my street. My neighborhood is arranged into a sort of rectangle, dead ending at one end that presses up against the forest, and back towards the main road. I would always alternate my path to keep things fresh, sometimes heading to the left and up *Michigan Ave* to the farthest block, and sometimes the opposite direction towards *Fulton Ave*. Today, I’d chosen the latter path. Houses and parked cars slid by me as I stared straight ahead, losing myself in the music and thudding beat of my feet on the pavement. Reaching a crest, I caught a glimpse of the estuary to my right, the sunlight reflecting off it like it was a diamond. Another smile played across my face as I headed down the other side, hopping onto the sidewalk to get out of the way of a Cadillac heading the other way. *Don’t forget to keep an eye out for anything, Harry*, I mentally reminded myself.

   
Reaching *Fulton*, I quickly spared a glance to my right, seeing cars and trucks pulling into the parking lot of the *Lighthouse Market*. A thought occurred to me. *Maybe I’ll stop in and get a Gatorade or something when I’m done. I haven’t been in there in a while*. Turning away, I kept my pace steady, heading up the street before turning left onto *S. Wall*. I passed by more cars and houses, noting with slight surprise that a few were up for sale. I shook my head as I remembered hearing about some residents moving back to the more populated parts of the state. *People are nuts for wanting to leave here and go back to the cities*. The thought kept turning over in my head as I began to head back up the incline. But as I passed by a dirt road that stretched between *Wall* and the next street over, my train of thought was torn away as a huge shiver shot up my spine. I knew instantly it hadn’t come from the wind, either; my collar was still turned up. And besides, it hadn’t been the kind of shiver you get from it. It was an entirely different style.

  
The kind you get when someone is watching you.

  
I slowed to a stop, pausing the music and pulling the headphones off my ears as I looked around. The street was deserted; I saw no one standing in the front lawns or driveways of the houses nearby, and aside from the dull *thud* of loud music drifting from a house to my left, all I heard was the sounds of the birds in the trees, and the distant sound of the lawn mower still running. Turning to my right, I shot a glance down the dirt road to the next block. Nobody there either. I ran a hand through my hair, my mind trying to make sense of the sensation. After a moment, though, I simply shook my head and shrugged my shoulders. *I guess it was nothing. Nothing more than a chill, and you, for whatever reason, getting a little paranoid*. Sighing, I slid the headphones back on my head and hit play, Diana’s voice almost instantly soothing me as she shifted into *I Feel so Mmm…* Shaking off the last tendrils of discomfort, I turned away and resumed my jog, heading towards *Michigan Ave* and the opposite end of the neighborhood.

  
I wish to God I’d listened to my gut reaction and just gone home right there and then.

  
Reaching the other end of the neighborhood, I quickly moved up *Michigan* and hung a right onto *Wasson St*. This was a street that had become infamous to me for the amount of dogs that would rush to the edges of the fenced in yards, yapping their heads off at me as I passed. However, to my surprise, none came rushing forward as I passed by the houses I knew them to be at. *I guess the owners think the weather’s too cold to keep them outside today or something*. I wasn’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth, though; I kept going, shooting quick looks to the left and the right each time I came to a four-way intersection to make sure no speeding cars caught me by surprise. Some jackasses in the neighborhood tended to blast through at twice the posted speed limit more than a little often. Again, though, I was pleasantly surprised to not see a single car driving on the roads. *This may be a better jogging session than I thought it would be*. 

I decided that I would end the session by jogging down to the main road once I was done and head down to the boat ramp. Whenever I was in a good mood, I liked to walk through it, stopping to drink in the salt air and quickly shoot a look over at the *Kam*, a beautiful, yet sadly rusted and abandoned ship moored next to it.  


I reached the crest of the hill and began heading down, approaching the cross with *Pacific Ave*. I slowed, always stopping before crossing the second main street that made its way through our neighborhood into the next suburb. Reaching it, I shot a look to the left and right for cars. Seeing none coming, I began to step down from the sidewalk and cross the street. But as I looked up and ahead I froze, almost in mid-step.  


Someone was standing across the street.  


They were on the opposite side of the street to me, not standing on the sidewalk, but slightly back on the front lawn of a house. Normally, this wouldn’t have caused me to pause; I saw people out and about every single time I went for a run. What caused me to stop, though, was just how…*weird* the person seemed. For one, they were staring straight ahead at the other side of the street, still as a statue. They never turned their head to the left or right, looking across to the yard across from them. I couldn’t tell if it was a man or a woman, due to the fact they wore a giant hooded sweatshirt or jacket of some kind; the hood completely obscured their face and blocked it from my view. For another few moments I watched the figure, waiting to see if they would move. But they remained perfectly still. *Oh-kay, even I have to admit that’s a little weird*. I shot a glance to the left, debating whether I should swing straight up to *Cammann St* to avoid them. But then I shook my head. *Now you ARE being paranoid, man.* *You’ve dealt with junkies and robbers before; one person in a hood isn’t even close to as bad*.  


My decision made, I shot another glance around, then jogged across the street, eschewing the sidewalk to stay on the road. As I approached the figure, I began mentally chiding myself for being such a pussy. I decided to be polite that I would nod and wave to the person as I passed them. *Who knows? Maybe it’ll brighten their day*. The figure continued to stare straight ahead as I approached, and as we drew level with one another, I did indeed nod quickly, giving a half smile and raising the hand not holding my iPod into a wave as I shot past. For a moment, I thought the figure wouldn’t acknowledge my greeting, and began to turn away. But then I saw them raise a hand of their own to return the gesture, and the hood gave an almost imperceptible nod as well. For a brief moment, I saw the lower half of their face, catching a glimpse of a pleasant smile as well. And then I was past them, heading down the slightly steep hill towards *Fulton*. I turned my head to look straight ahead again, mounting the far left sidewalk and maneuvering myself around a Ford Taurus which stuck out of a driveway. I again lost myself in the music and workout, making my way to the end of the street. As I reached the intersection, I chose to spare a look back the way I’d come. And I felt a shiver rocket up my spine.  


The figure had turned to look down the road after me. At *me*.  


Instantly I turned away, feeling quite uncomfortable by the sight. Another shiver shot through me, letting me know he was still watching me, and I hurried to head up the street to the final block of my exercise. But I couldn’t seem to shake the feeling loose from me. As I jogged past a wooden fence, I attempted to force the image from my mind. Not jogging on that stretch of road for a while, that’s just a little too friggin’ weird for me. Shooting a look down, I saw the sidewalk begin to curve, indicating I’d reached the street. I looked up.  


And stopped dead in my tracks.   


I wasn’t standing on the corner of *Fulton* and *Cammann*. I wasn’t even near it. Instead, I looked up to see the rectangular green sign proclaim that I was at the corner of *S. Wall St*. Confusion washed over me like a sneaker wave. What…what the hell? I shot a look behind me. Below me, I saw the street sign for *Maple St*, along with the edge of *Lighthouse Market* at the end. Sparing a glance the other way, I saw the two blocks above me, stretching up to the yellow *Dead End* sign. I shook my head, struggling to understand. *I don’t understand…did I just…imagine all of that? Did I get THAT lost in the music and my own thoughts?* It *was* possible; I’m a writer, and oftentimes I use the jogs as time to plan out stories in my head to write when I get home. And unfortunately, I tend to have an overactive imagination for someone my age, with a tendency to get lost in daydreams. *That’s the only thing it could be, the only logical one, anyways*. I took a deep breath, trying to silence the tiny voice in the back of my head, one that incessantly chided at me that I didn’t have *that* much of an imagination.  


Forcing it away, I did the only thing I could think to do: I turned and began jogging again, heading up *Wall St*. The surge of energy that coursed into my veins gave credence to the idea I’d simply imagined the last few minutes, and I forced myself to concentrate on the road ahead, only allowing myself a single thought about it. *That might make a good premise for a story, gotta keep that one in mind for when I get home*. Then I increased my pace, allowing the music to wash everything else away.  


I reached *Michigan* and, like I’d imagined, turned right onto *Wasson*. As I continued, I noted that no dogs came to bark at me from the yards and driveways. *Just like before*. I pushed the thought away; I *hadn’t* come through before. *I only daydreamed I did*. Forcing the thought away, I continued, passing by houses and parked cars as I approached the intersection with *Pacific Ave*. As much as I chided myself, however, I refused to look up until I reached the road's edge. Then, I looked across. And began laughing at what I saw.  


There *was* a shape there; exactly in the spot where I’d imagined I’d seen the figure. But it wasn’t a hooded person at all. It was a small tree or bush, one which had been trimmed and shaped into an odd shape. One that, if you weren’t paying close enough attention, could easily be mistaken for a person in the right light. Instantly I realized the shape must’ve stuck in my mind from the last time I’d gone out. *Shrubbery. You got creeped out by freakin’ shrubbery?* I let out another laugh and quickly shot a glance around before crossing the street, approaching the bush. I hit pause on my music and slipped my headphones off, the sound of my chuckles filling my ears as I shook my head. I spoke aloud. “Harry James Lake, you, my friend, are indeed one *hell* of a pussy. You’re supposed to scare your readers, not yourself. And especially not over fucking *shrubbery*”  


Chuckling again, I began to slip the headphones back on. But I stopped as I realized something. The sound of the lawnmower, the music, the barking dog. *All* of it had stopped. The neighborhood was completely and totally silent. It wasn’t a new experience; there had been times before when things fell completely still out here. It didn’t stop it from being creepy as shit when it did, though. *Because it feels like you’re the only person alive around here when it does*. Shivering slightly at the eeriness of it all, I turned and looked at the bush. And couldn’t help but shiver again as the image of the hooded figure smiling and waving back at me wormed forward in my mind. Jamming the headphones back over my ears, I hit play, Diana’s singing again filling my ears. This time, however, her voice didn’t bring me the warm and relaxed feeling it usually did. Only a thin veneer of it. Turning away, I quickly jogged away from the spot, trying to ignore the chills that shot up my spine and refusing to look behind me, as much as my instincts screamed at me to. I reached the end of the block and turned left, making sure to keep my eyes up and focused on the street sign ahead. I drew alongside the tall wooden fence of someone’s yard, increasing my pace and feeling more confident that I would reach it.  


That’s when something slammed into the fence from the other side, hard enough for it to buckle.  


“*Fucking hell*!” I shouted aloud, leaping off the sidewalk and half into the street as I tore my headphones off. Instantly, my ears were filled by the sounds of what had to be one hell of an aggressive dog barking on the other side. It again struck the fence, the sounds of it scratching fiercely at the wood rising with its guttural cries. I stood there for a moment, breathing heavily. My heart raced in my chest, and I bent over slightly, putting my hands on my legs as I let out a nervous, choked laugh. “Jeezum freaking Crow, man. Frick” I lifted one hand and rubbed my face, sliding under my sunglasses to rub at my eyes. “People need to freakin’ train their dogs better. That almost gave me a damn heart attack” I let out another nervous laugh, then forced in a few more deep breaths. My heart began to slow, and I felt my breathing return to normal. The slow, dull ache of my well-worked muscles began to sing in my body as I stood still. The dog had thankfully stopped attempting to ram through the fence at me; the barking had stopped, it likely realizing I hadn’t posed any threat. I slipped my headphones back on my head, then stood up straight, my eyes lifting to look ahead of me.  


And I felt the blood in my veins turn to ice.  


I wasn’t beside the wooden fence anymore. I was back down at the intersection with *Wall*. Shock filled me. I *knew* I hadn’t daydreamed it this time. I *had* jogged around the two streets. And I knew I had been about to reach *Cammann* when the dog had startled me. So…how in the *hell* was I suddenly two blocks in the opposite direction? The biggest chill yet flooded through me, and I took a step backwards, looking around. Just as it had been my entire jog, I saw nobody outside. And since I hadn’t turned on my music again, I could hear that it was still dead silent in the neighborhood. *Emphasis on the fucking dead part*. As I stood there, a familiar, yet most unwelcome shiver shot up my spine again. The same one I’d had when I felt I was being watched. Even though I couldn’t see anyone, the feeling remained, and I didn’t like it one damn bit.  


I turned and looked down the road. The bright white roof and large sign of the market looked like, ironically considering its name, a lighthouse beacon in the situation I’d now found myself in. I made my decision in a microsecond, speaking aloud. “Yep, we’re going this way now” And with that, I began jogging quickly down the road, the hill increasing my speed as I went along. I kept my eyes trained on the roof as it began to grow in size, and a renewed sense of hope began to fill me. *I’m gonna make it to the store. Yes!* I pumped my legs faster, ignoring the burning protest that came from them.  


That was when the sun…I honestly don’t know. The *only* way I can describe it, is that it was like one of those spinning dimmers light switches in a person's house, able to crank up the brightness at will. One moment, I was speeding towards the market, the sun only mildly blinding me as I burst out from beneath the trees. The next, it suddenly intensified, so bright that even with the sunglasses on, I had to squeeze me eyes shut. I continued to run, though, refusing to stop. A moment later, the sun seemed to return to normal, and I opened my eyes, blinking a few times to rid my vision of the black and blue spots that had taken residence in them.  


I was running past *Wasson St*. Towards *S. Wall*.  


I skidded to a stop, almost slipping on some loose gravel and falling as a mixture of shock and disbelief slammed into me like a Peterbilt. For a moment, I stared, blinking. Then I spoke, my voice rising into a shout.  


“…What…the actual…*fuck*?!”  


Nobody answered me, the sound of my voice almost seeming to shatter the silence like a baseball through a plate glass window. Yet another chill shot up my spine, and I cast an increasingly paranoid look around, seeing, as always, exactly nobody. “What the *hell* is going on?” I swallowed hard, casting a look back down at the market below. Part of me wanted to try running for it again. I almost did. But, somehow, I knew if I did, something would bring me right back here. Like I’m stuck in some kind of loop. The thought made a sudden burst of fear shoot through me. I looked around, my brain screaming at me to come up with some kind of a plan. Only one came to mind.  


I began running to the nearest house.  


Reaching it, I slammed my hands against the front door in the loudest, most frantic knocking I had ever done. “Hello?! Please, if anyone’s in there, I need help!” I waited for a moment. But nobody came to the door. I quickly moved to the house next door, again banging and calling for help. Like before, nobody answered. And with blind panic beginning to rear it's ugly head, threatening to consume me, I began to race from house to house. From apartment building to apartment building, banging on every door and screaming my lungs out. Some of them had lights on in their windows, while others were dark. But the outcome was always the same. Nobody came to the door. And my screams seemed to echo off the buildings and cars, drifting and dying away. I felt my sanity traipse precariously towards a knife’s edge as I reached the corner of *Wall* and *Michigan*, my throat beginning to sting from screaming so much. I cast a look to the left, my eyes widening as I saw the side of my own apartment building just a single block down. *Home.* Without even thinking, I began sprinting for it, a mixture of fear and hope filling every fiber of my being as it drew nearer. More hope surged as I reached the corner.  


Where my foot caught a raised slab of pavement.  


I fell ass over teakettle, the concrete tearing at my hands and wrists. For a few moments I simply lay there, breathing heavily and terrified of what I’d see when I looked up. Finally, I forced myself to lift my head. And I felt tears begin to seep from my eyes, and utter hopelessness fill me. Because I was back at the corner of *Michigan* and *Wall*.  


I think a small bit of my sanity cracked then and there. Because the next span of time, which I’m honestly not sure how long it was, is nothing but a blur. A blur of running down the same two streets I’d somehow found myself trapped in, like I was a rat in an endless maze. I can vaguely remember the sounds of my own screams and shouts echoing in the silence, remember slamming my hands against doors, sometimes even the same repeatedly. And I can vaguely remember that no matter what I did, I always ended up back at the corner again, no matter where I tried to run. But there *is* one thing I can recall with crystal clarity.   


And that was the seemingly unending feeling of being watched. Of being observed. And not by anything you would *remotely* call benevolent.  


I’m not sure when I snapped back to reality. Time seemed to matter little in the loop I found myself in; the sun refused to move at all from its position high in the sky even though what must’ve been hours passed. But suddenly, I became cognizant of myself again. Myself and my surroundings. The first thing I realized was that I was back at the cross street of *Wasson* and *Pacific*. I looked down at my hands, one which somehow still clutched my iPod in an almost death grip. My knuckles were red and raw from how much I must’ve been banging against the doors, and my throat felt as if someone had jammed a red-hot poker down it. My cheeks were wet from crying, and my lungs felt as if they were on fire. The second thing I realized, was what stood across the street from me on someone’s front lawn.  


It was the figure. Not the bush shaped like a figure. *The* figure.  


It still stood as still as a statue. Just like the first time I’d seen it, which I now knew hadn’t been a daydream. The hood still covered its head, and it stared straight ahead at the opposite side of the street. A surge of fear welled up in me as I realized I couldn’t see the bush anymore. My mind raced. *How long has it stood there? How many times did I pass by it without realizing? How long has it been watching me? And what does it want?*  


The final thought sent a new emotion through me, likely the only one I could still feel besides fear and blind panic. Anger. Red hot anger, rage being the better descriptor, began to boil inside of me as the dots connected. It had to be the reason I was here. It was the reason I was trapped in this hellish loop. *All because…what? I’d decided to be polite and smile and wave at it?* The thought made the rage burn hotter, and even though part of me screamed not to, I began to march across the street towards it. My mouth opened, and I began to yell at it, to scream, actually. “*Why?!* Why the *fuck* are you doing this?! What the *hell* did I ever do to you?! What the hell do you *want*?!”   


I stopped about fifteen feet from it, breathing heavily and feeling like I wanted to commit murder. I waited for an answer, waited for it to acknowledge my screams. But it simply continued to stare straight ahead as if it hadn’t even heard me. I was about to take another step forward, when an almost deafeningly loud sound assaulted my ears. For a moment, I couldn’t understand what it was, my mind unable to process. Then, I realized I’d still had my headphones on my head. My iPod had begun to play, and I quickly lifted the hand holding the device, unclasping my fingers and reaching out to stab at the off button. But I froze, both at the title and artwork displayed on the screen, as well as the vocals that began filling my ears. *Don’t Fear the Reaper*, by Blue Oyster Cult.  


I froze. Whatever rage I’d had seemed to die away instantly, replaced by the biggest, coldest shiver I’d ever felt shoot up my spine and causing me to gasp out loud. The singing continued, Buck Dharma’s voice yelling at me to not fear the reaper as the first chorus began. That was when the first tendrils of horror, beyond even the insanity tearing amount I’d already felt began to seep into me. I hadn’t hit play, and I’d been listening to Diana Dors, not Blue Oyster Cult. It was as if the song had been selected on its own, almost as if….  


*Almost as if it were some kind of a message*.  


My eyes suddenly went wide, and feeling as though my heart were about to stop, I slowly lifted my head to look at the figure less than twenty feet in front of me. Which had turned in my direction as I’d been preoccupied. The head was still bowed too low for me to see anything but its lower face. Then, it slowly raised one hand to wave at me. The fingers twittered like a person would do waving at a pet or a wild animal, ever so playfully. That movement alone sent a bolt of renewed terror through me. But it wasn’t what made me scream, every part of me filling with existential horror. It wasn’t what made me turn and begin sprinting away, dropping the iPod to the ground, the headphones tearing themselves off my head and the blaring music replaced with the shrill sound of my own screams as I felt my mind fracture into a thousand pieces.  


It…*smiled* at me. It Grinned.

  


I can’t remember much after that. Only vague snippets at most. And those…those, I can’t help but shudder at. *Those*, I wish I could forget. Because I remember shooting looks behind me, to see that…*thing*, chasing after me. The hood still covering its head as it continued to grin at me. Grin with a mouth far too wide for its face, and filled with teeth that more closely resembled a shark or alligator than a human's. Chasing after me, but never touching the ground as it did.  


The next thing I remember was waking up in the hospital, straps holding my arms and legs tight to the bed like I was a mental patient in an asylum. When I began calling out, a nurse, doctor, and to my surprise, an armed guard rushed into my room. For a few moments, they stared at me as if I were about to attempt to attack them. But once they realized that I had returned to the land of the sane, they immediately began bombarding me with questions. About what had happened to me. Whether I took any kind of drugs or drank profusely. Whether I had a history of mental illness.  


I wanted so badly to tell them the truth. But I knew the only thing it would do for me was buy me a one-way ticket to the funny farm, permanently. And so, I lied. I told them that I’d been attacked on my run by a man who’d attempted to kidnap me. In my mind, I thought it’d explain my delirium to them. People who are kidnapped and manage to escape often do so with their mental state in a fragile state, if not completely broken. For a few moments, I thought they’d see right through my charade and call me out. But, somehow, they bought it. They brought the police in, asking me to give an account and a description of my attacker. On that, I didn’t really lie. Not much, anyways. I told them that they’d hid their face under a hood of some kind, giving a vague description of some kind of well built white man in his forties. The kind that could easily overpower a slightly overweight, twenty-something year old guy.  


Again, they bought it. After showing me the sketch they’d made, one of the officers patted my shoulder reassuringly. “Don’t worry, son”, he said to me with a smile, “If he’s still around here, we’ll find him” Then he handed me something in a plastic evidence bag.   


“I believe this belongs to you, we found it a few blocks away from where we found you. You must’ve dropped it in the struggle” I couldn’t say anything, only nod as I stared at my iPod, now scuffed with several scratch marks from its fall. And…from *something* else. Something which had made a single, deep gouge in the metal back of the device.  


I knew they’d never find any trace. Because what, in a way, *did* kidnap me, wasn’t human. Not even remotely human, outside of vague appearances. I don’t know how I managed to get away. How I managed to survive. I wonder if that…*thing* was simply toying with me, the same way a cat might toy with a bird when it’s not hungry. Or if I actually managed to break free. Either way, though, I’m thankful. Thankful I’m still alive.  


Like I said at the start, after I’d returned home, and, I guess for the sake of my own sanity, I began to endlessly tell myself that what I’d seen, what I’d experienced, hadn’t been real. That I had, in fact, suffered a simple mental break, either from stress, or actually being attacked by another person that day. That none of it had actually happened. When my own words didn’t help, I’d replace them with alcohol. And slowly, surely, as the months went on, it *did* in fact begin to feel as though it had been nothing more than a waking nightmare. I slowly began to return to a normal life. I even went back to jogging, though I changed my route, choosing to jog through the next neighborhood over instead. Nothing ever happened to me, and I never felt like I was being watched again. Not by anything that wasn’t human, anyways.  


Until, like I said, yesterday. Which is the reason I decided to write this, to share it with you.  


You see, I got a phone call from Mark, a friend of mine who recently moved into one of the emptied houses at the end of *Wasson St*. Where it links up with *Fulton*. He called; asking me to help bring some stuff of his he couldn’t fit in his little hatchback over from his folk’s place. For a moment, I felt a small pang of hesitation as a flicker of memory surfaced. Then I pushed it away, and said I would absolutely help him. We met at my apartment, and together, we climbed into my International Scout, driving over to his parents and loading the flat screen TV, mattress and other large boxes into the back. Then, we drove back across town and into the neighborhood. I turned on *Wasson* from *Michigan*, driving down streets I hadn’t been on in a year. I forced myself to appear calm, as Mark knew nothing about what had happened to me. When we reached the intersection with *Pacific*, I felt a small shiver shoot up my spine, and for a moment couldn’t bring myself to look over across the street. Then I forced myself to.  


The bush sat there, looking slightly eerie, but nevertheless very inanimate in the fading light. I reached down and flicked on my headlights, banishing away the gloom and showing poignantly that it *was*, in fact, nothing but shrubbery. *Get ahold of yourself, man. None of that even happened, anyways*. Realizing that Mark was staring at me, I eased onto the accelerator and drove across the intersection. I spared a last look at the bush as we passed. It still looked normal. I let out a snort, shaking my head. *Told ya*. As we began to draw near his house and slow down, I suddenly saw him turn around in his seat and look out the back glass. “What is it, bro?” I asked him. For a moment, he simply continued to look, and then turned back to me. “You know anybody on this street besides me, man?” A small wave of confusion washed over me, and I shook my head as I parked in front of his place. “No, not that I’m aware of anyways. Why?”  


He turned and pointed back through the back glass. “Apparently somebody does, look”  


That was when an almost forgotten, but horrifyingly familiar chill shot up my spine. I felt the blood drain from my face and my heart begin to pound in my chest as I twisted around in my seat to look behind us.  


There, back up the hill near the intersection, stood a figure. A figure bathed in the yellow glow of the streetlight which had snapped on overhead. One whose upper face was obscured by a hood pulled down low over its head. I felt myself begin to violently shake as the figure raised one arm to wave at us, twiddling the fingers like a human would at an animal.  


A flash of white caught the streetlight’s glow, coming from the exposed lower half of its face.  


As it *grinned*
