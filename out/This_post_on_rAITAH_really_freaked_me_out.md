So the other day, I came home after a Maccas shift. I pretty much collapse onto my bed cos I got put on for 12 hours, despite being 15. Which I'm pretty sure is illegal in WA but my manager's a dick and it's weekend rates so whadaya gonna do. I'm just doomscrolling on tiktok pretty much, still wearing the shirt and the dumb hat, probably covering my bed in burger smell which means my Mum'll no doubt snap at me about it in the morning unless I wash the sheets now but i cannot be fucked. Tiktok's got nothing for me, but fucked if I'm getting up right now so I switch to reddit and I do more of the same. I mostly just have like video game subreddits and stuff in my home page but I notice a different post that sticks out. It's a recommended post from r/AITAH. It's something different, pulls me out of this sort of delirium-induced, trance-like scrolling so I open it.

"AITAH for blowing up at one of my casual employees?"

Immediately it reminds me of shithead Daren, my manager. I've seen him peel out of the car park in his spew-orange Commodore (He thinks he's so cool driving that thing but like he has to know it's like the number one bogan-mobile right? He can't be THAT far up his arse can he?) spewing out bullshit multiple times. As if anyone who happens to be leisurely strolling by the Girrawheen McDonalds car park gives a shit. And the verbal abuse isn't restricted to the outside of our fine-dining establishment by any means. I've copped it, my mates have copped it, customers cop it. He's a mess but he's all bark and it's this or KFC so fuck it right? Over-compensating dickhead.

Anyway, the post goes on to describe how the guy yelled at some "dweeby teenager" who refused to "obey" him and didn't "respect his superiority". I'd say he probably meant to say "authority" but dude literally used the word "obey", like come on. I check the comments cos I already know that reddit was gonna come down on this guy, but they're not what i expect, and not cos they're supporting him either.

    ->   "Don't do it dude" - 405 upvotes

    ->   "no way mods are leaving this up" - 299 upvotes

    ->   "You don't need reddit's opinion, you need professional help my guy" - 623 upvotes

I have no idea what they're talking about but I'm all the more intrigued so I go back to where I was up to. He mentions driving home from work in his "sick-ass amber Corvette". He's seemingly finished with describing the interaction that the post is supposed to be about. However, he is going on and on about how he's going to get back at this kid. Then he really goes off the rails. 

“I mean I know where the fucker lives, it’s right there on every payslip” … “I’ll just go by his house first and take a look” … “He’s gonna learn his god-damned lesson”. 

Now the reason why I got so freaked out from this post, and the reason why I’ve been staying at my mate’s for a few night now, is cos of something I remembered the next morning when i woke up. I had come home so exhausted from the shift so it didn’t really register at the time you know? But i swear that there was that fucking lowlife’s spew-orange, bogan bandwagon, shitbox express Holden Commodore parked right across the road. 

Maybe KFC’s the way to go.
