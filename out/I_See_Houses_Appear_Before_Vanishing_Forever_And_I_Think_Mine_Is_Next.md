Have you heard of “Last Thursdayism”? It's the idea that the entire world was created spontaneously last Thursday in this perfect state that appears as if it has a longer history. All the people were instantly made with fake memories already in their head. 

Now, I know it's meant more as a thought experiment than something real… but recent events have me rolling this idea around in my head constantly. Driving me nuts. Let me explain. 

I’ve been living out of my late grandpa’s old farmhouse a number of miles outside town for about a year now. It's modest, and I’ve done what I can to fix it up, but it's still a bit of a run down place. The area I’m situated in is very rural; many miles of flat, arid fields and few neighbors.  

In addition, I have to commute into town for work, which is about 25 miles away. Needless to say, I drive around these parts often and know the area well. I’ve only ever had one other house anywhere near me, this nice family that were friends with my grandpa before he passed. Their house is about a mile away from mine. 

This is all to say that I was puzzled when I saw the first house. It was sitting right smack-dab in the middle of a field I drive past every morning. I’d never seen it before. It didn’t look anywhere near new either. But I figured I must have just never noticed it before now. I kept on driving.

But, I swear to God, on my way home that night, and maybe it was just dark and I was mixing things up, but the house was gone. The field was back to how I remembered it. Empty.

I went on with my day-to-day for the next week, all the while not being able to shake that house from my head. 

I checked out the area a couple times on my commute. There was no mark of a foundation ever being present, a driveway ever being there. I just didn’t get it. I was pretty sure there were even lights on inside. Was someone there?

I next noticed a lone grain silo at a four-way intersection 12 miles out of town. Not near any farm or anything, just standing there, huge and rusty, silently bearing down on me with its existence, because I *knew* it hadn’t been there just the other day. I stopped my car and got out. 

I ran my fingers across the cool, solid metal. I hit it with my palm, a hollow bang resonating back. I crouched down and saw how it was firmly planted into the ground. How the grass grew around it, but not under it. This must have been here for years. 

That silo remained for a few days before it, too, disappeared. I inspected it just as I had with the house. The grass grew where it once hadn’t. No buildings around whatsoever. I felt that feeling you get when someone’s watching you… that spine-tingling feeling. I tried to ignore it. These things must be my imagination. That’s the only explanation that made any sense.

It was only a day after the silo disappeared that I found a new, well, really old looking mobile home a few miles away from my house. It was sitting near the road, sagging under its own weight, covered in kudzu. There was actually even a rusty ford pick-up parked right next to it.

I saw a glimpse of a person through the window, though I couldn’t make out much detail. I considered stopping to speak to them before realizing how late I was for work already. I’d have to talk after work.

Color me surprised to find *no* mobile home anywhere on my drive home that evening. No sign of one. No pick-up truck. Nothing. I decided then that whatever I find next, I needed to get answers. I can afford to be late to work.

For the next month, I didn’t see anything unusual. The days passed how they had in the past and things began to feel normal again. 

I woke up one morning, made my coffee, scrolled on my phone, got dressed, the usual. I think that was the first morning in a while where I didn’t have that mobile home on my mind. It was a good morning. I grabbed my briefcase and walked out the door.

The color of it caught me off guard first. 

It was bright blue, the color of the sky. The farmhouse gleamed proudly, right on the opposite side of the road, right across from my house. It had a big shed and a bigger garden on either side. A couple cars were parked out front. It was so new, so cared for, it was all practically shining in the morning light. A woman wearing an apron walked out the front door and waved at me with a smile.

My briefcase fell from my hand and a cool chill ran up my spine. It felt like something was breathing down my neck.

I had to speak to this woman. I paced down my driveway and onto and past the road, approaching her.

“Good morning,” she said, her waving hand falling and resting on the pristine white railing of the porch.

“Hi, good morning! Can I speak to you real quick?” My words were quick and short of breath.

“Sure, is everything alright?”

“Uh, when did y'all move in? Build this place? Looks pretty new.”

She laughed quietly. “What do you mean? We’ve been here about seven years now. Before you even. I knew your grandfather. You know that.”

“I… forgive me, I know this is odd. But that just isn’t true. I’ve been here a while and I don’t know you or your house.” I glanced past her, through the window, to see three kids at a dining table.

The smile faded from her face and concern took its place. “Are you sure you’re alright? You seem a little confused. Do you want some water?”

At this point I didn’t think I would get much further than this and I didn’t want her to think I was totally crazy. So I dropped it.

“No, that's fine, thank you. Sorry for the mix-up, I’ll be on my way now.”

“Okay, well, have a good day!” She tried to smile at me again but I could tell there was something else in her eyes.

I walked back to my yard, grabbed my briefcase, and threw it into the car. I sat there for a good minute and stared out at the house, into that window. A *whole family*. How did this happen? Am I crazy?

I went to work.

A whole week passed and nothing changed. The blue farmhouse remained, and the family in it too. I actually talked some more to them as I ran into them throughout the days. I became well-acquainted with the husband and they even invited me over for dinner. Things were fine.

A few weeks later, I drove home from work, and was backing into my driveway, when I saw it. Or didn’t. The landscape before me, on the other side of the road, was barren. A black, empty field that went as far as the eye could see. I stopped and sprinted out of my car and into the field. 

A sweat began to form on my neck and back and I breathed hard as I strained to look around for something, anything, a sign at all. I kicked at the grass and pulled a clump of dirt from the ground. I watched it fall from my hand, fading to nothing. There was never a house here. Never a family. No cars. No shed. No garden. I ran back to my house and slammed the door shut. I couldn’t sleep that night.

I was freaked out and decided I needed to talk to my only neighbors that lived a mile away. There’s no way I’ve been the only one seeing things. I got up the next morning and got dressed to make a visit. 

Just as I walked out the door, I saw a kid climbing up the big oak tree in my front yard. I recognized him as the kid of the neighboring family. I walked down the gravel driveway and looked up at him in the tree. 

“Having fun up there?” I asked.

“Hey, mister! Can I ask you a question?” The kid slid down a branch and settled closer to me.

“Course you can. What’s up?” 

The boy wiped the sweat from his furrowed brow. “When did you move here? I’ve never seen you before.”

“Well, uh, my grandpa lived here before me, but he passed. I’ve been here for a year now.”

“A whole year? Didn’t you just build this house? I’d never seen it before today.”

A chill ran down my spine. “I… I mean, maybe you’ve just never walked over here before.”

“I walk here every Saturday morning to build my fort! See?” He pointed to the buckets, planks, and drawings etched into the bark that lay scattered throughout the tree. “You must be good at building houses! Wanna help me?”

My throat turned dry and I backed away a few paces. “I think you can handle it fine yourself, kid.” I turned my back on him and walked back into the house, shutting the door and locking it.

My world was spinning. I felt nauseous. I peeked my head through the blinds and I could see the kid staring at me, my house. Did I just appear today? Am I going to disappear? 

Am I even real?

I didn’t see the neighbors. I couldn’t stomach it. Still can’t. I’ve just been sitting at home for the past three days since I talked to the kid. 

I feel like those people I talked to. I thought they were fake… and maybe that’s true. But… did they think they were real? I guess so, they told me so themselves. Where did they go once their house disappeared? Will I find out?

I’m obsessed with this. I can’t stop thinking about it. What, if any, of my memories are real? Are my memories of seeing these fake houses even real? Are those kid’s memories real? Jesus. I’m going crazy.

I haven’t disappeared yet, but I’m convinced something's going to happen soon. I’m writing this all down and posting this just so I made a mark. I need people to know I exist. That I was here, if god forbid, something really does happen.

I am real.

I am real.



I am…
