I froze as I felt a hand on my shoulder. Slowly, with my heart pounding in my ears, I turned.

It was Beatriz.

Her hair was messy from sleep, her eyes half-closed but alert enough to catch me standing there like a statue. She whispered, annoyed:  
"What are you doing here in the middle of the night? And what’s with all the noise?"

Relief washed over me, though my hands were still trembling. I pointed at the forbidden door.  
"Listen… the sounds were coming from there. Lights, whispers—I swear it wasn’t just the wind."

Beatriz glanced at the door. The hall was still. The papers with symbols no longer moved, the faint glow I had seen was gone. It was as if the house itself had swallowed the evidence.

She shook her head and gave me a sleepy smile.  
"You’re just letting that old man get in your head. He spooked you with his warning, and now your brain is playing tricks."

I wanted to argue, but her calmness made me doubt myself. Maybe she was right. Maybe fear had taken over.  
"Good night," she said, already turning back toward her room.

"Good night…" I muttered, though the thought of those whispers lingered long after I forced myself into bed.

The next morning, the sun spilled golden light over Kyoto. After breakfast, we decided to explore more of the city—to clear our minds, or at least try.

We wandered through **Nishiki Market**, where the air was thick with the aroma of grilled yakitori and the sweetness of fresh mochi. Vendors called out cheerfully, their stalls overflowing with vibrant pickles, spices, and strange seafood displayed on ice. Beatriz stopped at a stand selling taiyaki, its sweet bean filling steaming as we bit into it, the crisp edges flaking in our hands.

From there we walked toward **Kiyomizu-dera Temple**. The wooden terrace stretched out over the hillside, buzzing with tourists, yet it felt serene. The faint scent of incense drifted in the air, mixing with the soft rustle of leaves in the breeze. I caught Beatriz staring at the red pagoda against the blue sky, and for a moment, it almost felt like we were just tourists, carefree.

Almost.

Because at every stop, every time we mentioned where we were staying, the smiles faded. At Nishiki Market, a woman selling pickled plums paused, her cheerful tone dropping:  
"That district? You… live there?"

At Kiyomizu-dera, a monk guiding visitors offered a polite bow, but when Beatriz casually described our old rental house, his eyes darkened. He quickly excused himself, almost as if the words themselves were dangerous.

It happened again at a small ramen shop near Gion. The chef laughed with us until Beatriz, without thinking, said:  
"We’re staying in an old machiya house nearby—"

Silence. His ladle stopped mid-air. His gaze flickered, unsettled. He changed the subject immediately, avoiding eye contact.

By the end of the day, the weight of it was undeniable. Kyoto was dazzling, beautiful, alive… yet the moment our house was mentioned, it was as though a shadow fell across every face.

That evening, when we returned home, the golden glow of lanterns lit the narrow street. Inside, the wooden beams creaked with their familiar voice, like the house was aware of us.

We prepared a simple dinner—rice, grilled salmon, miso soup. Before eating, Beatriz propped her phone against a cup, and we video-called our family back home. Their voices filled the room, warm and reassuring, with the occasional laugh echoing through the tiny speakers. We tried to hide our unease, smiling and telling them about the market, the temple, the food. For a while, it felt like we carried a piece of home with us.

When the call ended, the silence in the house returned heavier than before. We ate slowly, chopsticks clinking against the bowls, the air thick with things left unsaid.

Finally, I broke it.  
"Don’t you think it’s strange? Everyone we talked to today… the way their faces changed the second we mentioned this place. Beatriz, I know what I heard last night. It wasn’t my imagination."

Beatriz set her chopsticks down, her expression serious now.  
"Yeah… I noticed it too. It wasn’t just one person, it was everyone. I think tomorrow we should… investigate. Maybe this house has a history we don’t know."

Hearing her say it gave me both relief and dread. Because it meant I wasn’t completely losing my mind. Something *was*wrong.

We cleaned up in silence and retreated to our rooms.

Sleep came heavy, but uneasy.

Somewhere in the dark, a sound tore me from my dreams.

A scream.

High, sharp, filled with terror. It jolted me upright, my body cold with adrenaline.

"Beatriz!" I gasped, already sprinting down the hall. The tatami mats creaked under my feet, every step echoing through the silence of the house. Her scream cut off abruptly, leaving only the pounding of my own heart.

I reached her door. My hand trembled as I gripped the handle. Slowly, I pushed it open.

The room was dark, shadows stretching unnaturally across the walls. The air was heavy, suffocating, as though something unseen pressed down on me.

And then I saw them.

Two glowing eyes, burning faintly in the corner of the room. They did not blink. They did not move. They only stared—cold, unhuman, waiting.

My throat tightened. I couldn’t breathe.

And then… something shifted in the dark.
