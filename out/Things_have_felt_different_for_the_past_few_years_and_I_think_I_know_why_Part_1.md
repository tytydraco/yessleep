Have you ever been high? On weed, or mushrooms, or LSD, or love, or adrenaline?

There's a kind of fuzzy deviance from your standard, sober, state. A state, I'm sure those who read this might think I'm in. It's like your brain is tuned to a different frequency, feeling emotions from things that might not affect you in the same way 'sober'. Thoughts arise from nowhere, and take on shapes and pull you in directions they wouldn't normally. "Normally" being the key word. Whatever that means. Unaffected, maybe? I don't know.

But what if you could get MORE "normal". More sober than you are when you're sober? More tightly attuned to your base perception of reality. And reality more attuned to you. The frequency that your brain is tuned to less plagued by the various experiential noise that comes with consciousness.

That noise is just too much data to process at once, so our brains create an approximate that we can tolerate. But, what if we could weed it out? Or experience it sequentially, instead of concurrently?

Tons of people throughout time have claimed to reach such a state, through prayer or meditation or drugs. I think these people are just describing other altered states, different methods of getting high. Witnessing reality at its root is not something that can be described, at least I don't know how to. Its raw, searing, heat imprints the concepts and laws one would use to describe it on some blank void. Some strange essence imbued to nothing at all, to create something new.

I sound fuckin' schizophrenic. I get it if you read the previous paragraphs and thought I was high, or crazy, or both. I would too if I never took the job that brought me the epicenter of this sharpening of reality. I've talked to people all over who feel like something has been DIFFERENT in the past 10 or so years, but accelerating recently. But it never feels more apparent than when I'm at work.

I moved alone to a small town in the hills of Kentucky about a year ago. I work online, and wanted to get out of the fast-paced, high-priced, noise of the city I lived in. I'm an inside cat anyway, so the fact that there was basically nothing for miles except a few general stores, bars, and gas stations sounded great to me. Peace at last.

The first month or so in my new digs went like normal. Clock into work, do my mundane tasks, clock out, get a drink maybe watch some TV or play video games, do it all again tomorrow. I like this kind of routine, I was happy. Until my company shat the bed and fired a bunch of us.

Obviously, I pretty quickly regretted my decision to move to bumfuck nowhere thinking my cushy online job would last forever. I had a chunk of savings, so I'd be fine for awhile, but I immediately started checking online for jobs both remote and locally. After a day of mostly fruitless searching, I had to consider if I should blow my savings to move back somewhere with more opportunities. I wish I did, but I never really had a chance.

The following morning came a knock at my door. The first I'd had since moving in over a month ago. I answered it to be greeted by a tall, pretty, blonde woman about my age wearing a large coat that didn't make sense in the 80-degree weather. She smiled at me with a kind and calming gaze and held out a large Tupperware container.

"Hey neighbor! I heard someone finally moved into this old place, I made you a housewarming gift!" She said with all the unnerving gusto of a 1950's housewife.

I reached out to the container she was holding towards me, "Oh! Thank you, so much! I didn't realize I had any neighbors up here."

"Well, I'm a few miles down the road, nobody is really 'next-door' out here but we're neighbors nonetheless! How are you liking it?" She asked.

"I like it quite a bit. It's definitely a change of pace, but I kind of enjoy the isolation. Where do you live?" I asked, tapping the container "So I can bring the Tupperware back."

"Oh don't worry about it I have a million of those. You just enjoy that, I'm told it's the best apple pie around! Who cares that it's the only apple pie around, right?" She laughed, "I'll leave you to it though, just wanted to say welcome!"

"Well, thank you again. Really, it's very nice of you... uh... I'm sorry I didn't catch your name. I'm Tim. Tim Green" I said as she began to back away from the door.

"Rebecca! Nice to meet you." She turned to descend the front steps and I went to close the door before she stopped and said something over her shoulder.

"You looking for a job by chance?"

I was shocked at the serendipity. A kind of off-hand question that might just be the perfect answer to my problems. I told her that yes, actually, I was, and asked what it entailed. She said it was a simple job, on location and staring at a computer all day, but it paid well. I was in no position to say no, so I agreed to come by and see what it was all about. She said she'd drop by the next morning so I could follow her there.

"Not the easiest place to find" She said. And boy was that a fucking understatement.

I spent the rest of the day fucking off and contemplating my decision to follow a strange woman to an unknown location. The pie was good though, and she was cute - if a little taller than I normally go for, so I decided to trust her.

The next day, she showed up around the same time. No heavy coat on this time. Instead opting for a more professional top and long skirt of muted colors. This was more along the lines of what I expected someone to wear if they were going to work in a professional setting.

It had been a while since I had worn anything professional myself. I had gotten far too accustomed to lounging around in a T-shirt and sweatpants while I worked. But it felt good to put on a dress-shirt and pants.

"Hey Tim! Wow, you're looking spiffy! Ready to go?" She asked with the same chipper demeanor as the day prior.

I laughed, "Yeah, thank you, I'm all set!"

"Alllllllrighty! Let's head out, it's not far." She said, turning around and waving me to follow her. I grabbed my keys, locked the door, and followed her down the steps. As I moved to walk to my car, I noticed the only car nearby was mine. Did she get dropped off? Kind of presumptuous but, who was I to argue with a job that fell into my lap?

More curiously, she walked AWAY from my car without looking back to me.

"Uh, Rebecca? I can drive us there." I said, keys jingling in my hand as I gestured to the car.

"Oh no, it's much easier to walk there, honestly. Come on!" She said back as if inviting me on some adventure.

"Into the.... woods?" I asked, as she stood among the scattered trees on the side of my house.

"Yeah! What, you're not afraid to be alone in the woods with a lady are you?" She teased, doing a little curtsy with her skirt on the word 'lady'.

As a matter of fact, I kinda WAS a little afraid. I hadn't explored the property much, but I was fairly certain there wasn't an IT department or office space in my backyard. All sorts of alarm bells were going off in my head. Was I really going to follow this woman into the woods? My basis for trusting her being that she made me a pie, offered me a job, and was kinda pretty?

I guess I was. Because I found my feet moving forward as Rebecca smiled delightfully back at me.

"It's basically a straight line, not far, just try to remember the path, I can't lead you there every day." She said as I followed her closely.

The woods weren't dense, more a spattering of trees and rocks in the valley between the hills on each side. And she WAS right, it was maybe 5 minutes of walking before she stopped us.

"And here we are!" She said, as we rounded the corner of a large rock formation.

"Uhhhhhh. Where is... here?" I asked, looking around and feeling foolish and a little worried. I followed a fucking crazy person into the forest. There's nothing here but the...

Rock. Huh. The rock was about 10 feet tall or so, and just as wide. I couldn't see it as we approached, but there was a door on the opposite side of it. One of those large, thick, metal types you see in hospitals or schools. A small keypad sat right next to the handle. Rebecca approached it as I was still trying to take everything in.

"You'll get your own number today, but I can get us in with mine this time." She said, like there was nothing at all strange about a fucking DOOR in a ROCK in the FOREST. I felt like I was the crazy one.

"What IS this?" I asked, "Some secret government facility? Drug trafficking? Serial killer hideout?"

"Alllll of the aboooveeeee" She said with the kind of spooky wobble people put in their voices when they want to sound like a ghost. I appreciated the attempt at levity, but it wasn't helping.

I heard three beeping sounds as she input her code and the door sprung open, revealing a staircase down. Lights flicked on to illuminate the path downwards. What had I gotten myself into?

"Oooookkkayyyy, before I go into the creepy staircase in the woods, can you shine some light on what this even is?" I said, finally standing firm in my trepidation. I can handle all sorts of weird, but this was something else entirely.

"Sure, scaredy-pants. I think it has something to do with cryptocurrency. Like bitcoin and all that. I don't really know for sure to be honest, but I imagine that's what all the servers and computers and everything are for. Honestly though, you can leave at any time if it gives you the creeps." She said, smiling a playful smile I found hard not to trust. The situation was weird, sure. But Rebecca seemed nice enough.

"Shit. Okay. Pay better be super good though." I joked, and let her lead the way down the steps. I followed behind her. I'd heard of these types of crypto-farms, tucked away in warehouses or bunkers. Some non-descript place with a lot of square-footage for the mining machines. Must be an old fallout shelter or something.

I allowed the door to close behind me, waited a second, and pushed it open again. That brought some comfort. At least I wasn't trapped in... whatever this was.

"Pay's definitely pretty good I think. What's good to you?" She asked as we descended the stairs.

"For this level of weird, I'm thinking six-figure minimum, hard to say without knowing what this even is though.", every step I took made me more anxious.

Rebecca looked over her shoulder at me and pointed one finger in the air thrusting it up and down and mouthed, 'higher'.

200k? 300k? What the fuck would I be doing exactly that would warrant that kind of pay. And why all the secrecy?

I felt a buzzing in my body as we approached the platform at the end of the stairs. Coupled with a warm nausea in my stomach and a quiet ringing in my ears. I leaned against the handrail for support.

"One sec." I mustered to Rebecca and she turned back towards me. The ringing was getting louder as the nausea swelled inside of me.

"Oh jeeze, I forgot. It'll pass soon, first few times are like that. Something with the computers I think." She said, rubbing my back in a comforting way.

The ringing got louder and louder, and the nausea was overwhelming. I was going to puke, for sure. I brought a hand to my mouth as the waves of sickness crashed into me then - blip -. Like watching an old CRT TV when the power goes out and then comes right back. It felt like my vision and hearing pulsed for a moment, as if my brain reset. I went to brush the sweat from my forehead, only to find it completely dry.

"See, not so bad. First time's a surprise though, huh?" Rebecca said still softly rubbing my back.

"What WAS that?" I asked as we walked forward past rows and rows and ROWS of servers, computers, just hundreds or thousands of black boxes with blinking lights shelved in towers taller than I was. Looking down the aisles between the rows it seemed to go on forever.

"Dunno. Some weird computer thing? Simon's office is up ahead, he'll get you all situated." She said.

"Simon?" I asked.

"The boss man, he's an interesting fella." She said, "But hey, so long as the check clears, right?"

"Yeah." I responded as we approached the end of the hallway. 3 doors stood before us, one in front, and one on each of the walls to the left and right. The one in front had a nameplate by it.

'Simon I.'

"Well, here's where I leave you." She said, sporting her signature bright smile, gosh she WAS awfully pretty, "I'm sure you'll do great, and I'll come grab you by the end of the day to walk you home. You ready?"

"As ready as I can be, considering." I said, an anxious chuckle escaping me.

"You'll do great!" She straightened my shirt and stood on her tip-toes to kiss me on the cheek. I was too caught off guard by the sudden display of affection to say anything. As I fought to find the words, Rebecca disappeared behind one of the other doors with a playful little twirl.

I shook myself free from my frozen state, and took a deep breath. It's not like that was the weirdest thing to happen so far, I think 'door-in-a-rock' takes the cake. I placed a hand on the door handle to Simon's office as something nagged at the back of my mind.

Was she wearing different shoes today? Why else would she have to stand on her tip-toes? Wasn't she as tall as me?

I turned the handle and entered the room.
