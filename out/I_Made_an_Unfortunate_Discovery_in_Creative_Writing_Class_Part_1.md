I always liked writing. Perhaps it was what contributed to my solitary life; I hadn’t had a single friend, and to this day, I still haven’t had one. There was one person who would call me a friend, although I wouldn’t say I considered him one.

​

Jason M was the effortlessly popular type of person; he was athletic, hardworking, and kind to everyone. Outside of English, he was even what one would call a natural genius. In fact, with my help, he graduated as valedictorian. If he had any flaws, it was that he was too perfect.

​

I utterly hated him, he conflicted with my cynical world view. Everyone was secretly miserable, and I was, so I knew it applied to everyone. I reveled in hearing snippets of outwardly perfect people struggling. I never heard anything like that about Jason; from all accounts, he was perfectly happy in every aspect. He even took his abysmal English grades well. Sure, he got a 67, but last time he got a 65, he was improving!

​

Jason barged his way into my life in my freshman English class. For some reason, the teacher thought that the critical analysis of literature was aided by the inane jabbering of fellow teenagers and assigned us to groups.

​

I had finished my own paper on Romeo and Juliet long ago, so I used my free time to write. It was difficult with all the noise. The solution of putting earbuds in was denied by the school’s strict no-smartphone policy, so I sat there, driven mad by Jason’s complete inability to grasp a theme. Eventually, I had had enough and helped him, if only to get him to shut up. Big mistake.

​

From then on, Jason took every pain to befriend me. Sharing with me his phone number and social media handles. I didn’t have social media, nor did I particularly want to give him my phone number, but I was confused by social interaction, and so I ended up giving it to him.

​

He would text me often, a mix of questions about English assignments and invitations to go do something. I helped him with the English and staunchly rejected the requests to hang out. And then one day, I hit a slump in my writing. I was the type of person to pull ideas from real life. I had been successful in pulling ideas from careful observation of my surroundings and eavesdropping, but I couldn’t seem to think of an idea that gave me any sort of drive to write like usual.

​

I started accepting his invitations, never very much, just once or twice a month. They did give me ideas and writing material, so it wasn’t a complete waste. Jason, of course, was annoyingly happy to see me. His friend group was not. It didn’t matter if they didn’t glare at me or even say things behind my back; I knew they all secretly hated me, but didn’t say anything about it because I was the friend of the ever-generous Jason. Jason, with his almost Christ-like kindness, was the only person I knew who could never secretly hate anyone. I hated him for it.

​

One day, Jason invited me over to his house. It was only remarkable because I was the only one there, and we had only hung out alone once or twice. I sat on the couch in his stupidly perfect house and played some shooting game I was terrible at. Of course, Jason was good enough that even with me dragging him down, he still easily carried us to victory.

​

“Hey, Jeff, I think I like you,” he said while taking down an enemy sniper.

​

“Well, you insist on dragging me places, so I assumed so,” I responded. I was in the middle of a firefight and losing badly.

​

“No, I mean like, like like you know?”

​

“Oh,” I was taken out by a sniper I didn’t even know existed,”why?”

​

“Don’t like, get mad at me. You left your notebook in class one day, and I kind of read it. You’re really prickly, you give off this vibe that screams ‘don’t talk to me’ but I dunno something about your writing helped me understand you, I think.”

​

“I see. You know I hate you, right?”

​

“Yeah. I know. Still, you’re meaner to me than you are to anyone else; it’s actually kind of cute, you know. I guess I like that you think about me more than anyone else. I wish I were as good at English as you; you’d probably have no issue expressing what I’m trying to say.”

​

I finally found Jason’s flaw. It wasn’t that he was gay; it was that he had fallen in love with someone like me.

​

A new match started, and he asked,”So do you want to go out?”

​

Did I want to date the man I hated most? Not particularly. I didn’t feel too strongly one way or the other, actually. I had never really thought about being in a relationship. At some point, I just assumed it was something I would never get to experience. I didn’t really care that Jason was a guy; my own sexuality was something I had never paid much attention to.

​

There wasn’t much reason to reject him; he would just keep being my friend like always. I could break his heart, a part of me wanted to, but really, Jason would bounce back from it perfectly like always. Accepting would be advantageous; the life experiences I was lacking would be bountiful, which would doubtlessly help my writing.

​

Weighing the pros and cons in my head, I said,” Sure.”

​

“I thought for sure you would say no.”

​

“Why even ask then?”

​

“Don’t know until you try.”



The two of us continued playing the game for some time before I asked,” So what does ‘going out’ entail exactly?”

​

“Just doing the same things as usual except like, gayly I think.”

​

I inadvertently laughed at his attempt at a joke.

​

Things didn’t change much. I accepted his invitations a bit more often, and we hung out alone a bit more often. Sometimes we would hold hands at his request. I never initiated physical contact, being touched was never something I was fond of, and I found that when the attempts at physical touch had a romantic sentiment behind them, I liked it even less.

​

We had sex a few times; it was the clumsy, embarrassing sex of the inexperienced. I spent the time trying to distract myself from the physical sensations. To memorize the surroundings and mood to properly give it life in my writing. I could never distract myself enough; I would always make my way to the bathroom soon after and relieve myself of whatever meal I had eaten beforehand.

​

If there was one thing Jason was good at, it would be that he was an uncritical audience for my writing. The themes were beyond him, but he would always give me some sort of glowing review, no matter what I wrote. He tried to persuade me to share it with others, but I refused. Whatever need I had to share my work with others was fulfilled by sharing it with Jason.

​

The relationship ended like all relationships formed in high school do; he was accepted to a good school, to nobody’s surprise, and I was accepted to a school with a good creative writing program.

​

In the months leading up to graduation, Jason fretted over changing schools to go to my own. I had learned from our time together that he enjoyed it when I was openly hostile and argumentative with him, so instead of expounding why I did not want him to be there, I instead focused on all he would miss out on by following me to a worse school.

​

This approach took time, but ultimately it worked. Jason was not stupid, even if I wished he was. When presented with a logical argument, he knew instinctively that unless there were any glaring holes in it, he would have to agree.

​

And so Jason and I parted ways two months after graduation. He spent every day by my side until the point where he would have to pack his things to move to his school. In the end, his departure left a strange taste in my mouth. A mixture of relief at finally being free of him and another emotion I couldn’t quite place. I didn’t think about it.

​

The freshman class I was a part of was unusually small. An accidental death the summer before, an inexplicable string of suicides during the fall, and a disappearance not too far into the spring had driven quite a few applicants away. The school had always had a higher mortality rate than most, but the sudden uptick in deaths and disappearances had catapulted it into infamy. Quite a few faculty had quit as well. The administration assured us in our orientation that it was simply a series of tragedies and that, as time wore on, things would return to normal. This placated the public somewhat, but there was still a consensus that the school was cursed somehow or another.

​

For my part, I didn’t care. This school had the two things I wanted: tuition on the lower side and a creative writing program that was well-regarded and well-funded.

​

I was smacked in the face by reality only two weeks into the semester. The assignment was to share your previous work with a few classmates and the professor, who would give feedback. All the feedback I received was the same: my plots, my ideas were fine, good even. My characters were the problem; all characters that were not the main character were flat, boring, and dragged my story down. My main characters were all exactly the same. Sure, they had more depth, but the way they reacted made my stories, as one reviewer put it, “incredibly boring.”

​

This review in particular made me seethe in anger. I had approached my own reviews diplomatically, trying my best to tone my criticisms down. Never mind the fact that this reviewer’s stories were all the same, trite, drivel. The harshest thing I had said to them was that they should try branching out into other genres.

​

Fine, if that was the case, then I would rise up to the occasion. I tended to base my main characters on myself, after all, it is the person I know the best. Since I required a certain amount of real-world understanding, that only left one person I could possibly base a character around. I refused to write anything tangentially related to Jason, so instead I would have to do my own research.

​

The first person that popped to mind was a girl who sat near me in the humanities building, where I tended to do my work. She was always talking to friends who would stop by between classes.

​

I sat in my usual spot and, as expected, she was already there talking to some other girl I didn’t know. Before, I would simply put my earbuds in and drown her out, but today, instead, I listened to her speak.

​

“So yeah, I’m like, totally cooked. The first quiz of the year, and I got a C,”she explained to her friend.

​

I opened a document on my computer and titled it “Allison” since I didn’t know her real name. I wrote,”uses slang, poor at humanities.” I didn’t know what she got a C on, but given my location, that was my best guess.

​

I kept this up for a week, working on other assignments when she wasn’t talking before quickly switching to the document if she revealed anything about herself.



“Allison” was actually Emily something or other, but I still thought of her as Allison. She was a philosophy major with a minor in business. Her biggest hobbies were complaining about her boyfriend, using social media, and Korean boy bands. She played soccer, but as she put it, she was “mid.”

​

Progress slowed after that. I didn’t have what I really needed to know: why did Allison do the things she did? What were her goals? I wasn’t going to figure them out just by listening, so I created some fake social media accounts, cropping group pictures I had from high school, and making personas out of Jason’s friends. Finding her online wasn’t difficult, so I followed her with the fake accounts slowly, hoping not to raise an alarm.

​

Her accounts were helpful. I knew now that she wanted to start a non-profit for the conservation of endangered tropical birds. She had three sisters, one of whom also attended this school, and had recently broken up with that boyfriend she complained so much about.

​

I started trying to create a fully realized character out of Allison. I changed a few things. I didn’t understand the obsession with K-pop, so instead, she was really into manga, a topic I knew more about. When I was writing her dialogue, I had a hard time trying to use the amount of slang she did, so that noticeably dropped. Anything I didn’t have knowledge of regarding her, I filled with my own imagination.

​

The story I would put her in was typical of what I wrote, something bizarre and horrifying. It was difficult to decide what Allison would do in a given situation, and so I wrote slower than I usually would, but in the end, I had created my strongest work yet.

​

The professor and my peers seemed to enjoy it. They still had criticisms, mostly to do with the minor characters, but ultimately, I was proud of what I accomplished.

​

I was sitting in my normal spot when I noticed someone out of the corner of my eye and heard someone trying to talk to me over the music playing from my earbuds. I took them out and looked towards the person; unexpectedly, it was Allison.

​

I felt my heart rate spike as I wondered if she had noticed my behavior. I didn’t think I had done enough to classify my behavior as “stalking,” but that’s a very subjective word.

​

“Jeff, is it? Whatcha working on,” she asked.

​

“Nothing really,” I mumbled. I was confused as to why she was talking to me, and I was even more confused as to why she knew my name.

​

“I saw the Chainsaw Man sticker on your laptop and thought it was cool,” she explained.

​

Jason had purchased it for me; it was one of the few things we liked together.

​

“I didn’t know you liked it.” I really didn’t. Emily, not Allison, had never mentioned being even slightly interested in anime. Even online, it was all gifs of K-pop singers.

​

“I don’t,” Allison asked, as if it were a question. A strange look came over her face, and she seemed as confused as I was before she regained her composure,” Ah, what am I saying, of course I do. I’ve been following it for a while.”

​

I was both confused and in a social situation. I supposed I should probably keep it going, even if I wasn’t excited about it.

​

“So, uh, who’s your favorite character,” I asked the first thing that came to mind.

​

“Makima, oh, I also really like Asa and Yoru.”

​

“I feel the same,” I said distractedly. My confusion was rapidly becoming apprehension, I told myself that the chances of her having the same favorite characters as myself wasn’t so strange. It was a very popular series, and the characters she named were popular.

​

“So is it your favorite series?” I was testing her, trying to see if the hypothesis I was building was correct.

​

“Ah, no, not by a long shot,”she laughed,”I don’t know if you’ve heard of my favorites, they’re pretty obscure.”

​

“So what are they?” Her attitude felt elitist, like I was being looked down upon. It rubbed me the wrong way.

​

“Ah, I can’t choose between 20th Century Boys and The Fable, so I just say they’re both my favorite.”

​

“You were right, I don’t know those,” I lied.

​

“Well, they aren’t super popular.”

​

“If you will excuse me, I have to go to class now. See you later, Emily,” I had started to get up when she said something.

​

“Ah, that’s not my na-,” she faltered for a moment and then muttered so quietly I almost couldn’t hear her,” Actually, what is my name?”

​

“Why don’t you check your student ID?” I suggested as I walked away.

​

I hurried my way across campus, trying to make sense of it all. When I got to my dorm, I pulled out my laptop and opened both my story and the character outline of Allison. Sure enough, I hadn’t really elaborated on her interest in anime at all. It was just a hobby; in fact, I hadn’t even included it in my story since it wasn’t relevant. I had written with it in mind, of course, but it wasn’t really that important. So why did her tastes match up exactly with mine? Clearly, something was happening here; this was no coincidence.

​

I pulled up her various social media pages, all of which had been wiped clean of any interest of hers that I had gotten rid of in Allison. There were still posts up about tropical birds and her family, but she had manually gone back and deleted thousands of posts. She had posted quite a bit in the past day, all of it about either tropical birds or her newfound hobby. I saw some of her friends teasing her about her sudden personality shift, and a few seemed alarmed, but she didn’t respond to any of them.

​

I closed my laptop and went to my bed to lie down. I had an inkling of what was happening; for some reason or another, Emily had become Allison. Or was becoming Allison, she reacted strangely when things didn’t match what she had previously known. If I left details vague, my own preferences and knowledge were used, it seemed.

​

I had four questions. Firstly, how did she know my name? I hadn’t written it anywhere on Allison’s character page, nor did I write it on the story I had turned in electronically. Secondly, if Emily became one of my characters, did that mean she would experience the story I had written with her in it? Thirdly, if character traits were taken from my own knowledge, what would happen if I gave her a trait I knew nothing about? Could I specify that she had knowledge from someone else? Lastly, what triggered this? I didn’t edit the character sheet until I was ready to write, so possibly just specifying that the character “Allison” had a trait meant Emily had that trait too. If not, what was the minimum word count needed to trigger this change?

​

I thought back to the things I had written before; all of my characters were, for lack of a better word, self-inserts. I had never been interested in deviating from my own personality, really, but there was a time when I threw in a character trait that didn’t match myself.

​

It was in middle school, I was writing the same stuff as ever and wanted to try something new. I couldn’t change myself too much, I would be out of my depth if I wasn’t writing someone I knew very well. So, as a small change, I made the main character like pickles. I never liked them, but this character did. I finished the story, didn’t feel it was the best and forgot about it. Then, a month later, I was with my parents at some diner. My meal came with a pickle spear. I ate it. No one said anything about it, and at the time, I didn’t think it was odd. I had always liked pickles.

​

I struggled with the memory; I hadn’t thought about that story in ages. When I placed myself in the headspace of my past self, I felt strange. I was thinking about how I should give my new character a small quirk to distinguish him from myself. I could feel the statement,”I don’t like pickles,” in my memory, but even at the time I was thinking this, I remember liking pickles. I must not have liked them, otherwise my entire experiment would have been pointless.

​

I wondered if there was more I had changed over the years. I had been writing for so long that it’s possible I had accidentally changed myself as a child. I pondered the question, but I didn’t feel particularly disturbed at the revelation. I was more curious than anything.

​

I didn’t feel like getting out of bed, so I pulled up Allison’s character sheet on my phone. I wanted to test my own questions, so I wrote “likes football, has Jason’s knowledge and enthusiasm about video games, and always greets Jeff when she sees him by saying ‘Great Scott! It’s Jeff!”

​

The next day, I sat in my usual spot and waited for Allison. I idly played some game on my phone in the meantime. I had come up with at least a dozen more questions in the interim, but I wanted to take this slowly; adding too many variables was dangerous.

​

I waited several more minutes before Allison greeted me,”Great Scott! It’s Jeff!”

​

Looks like I don’t have to write a whole story. Now to test the other questions.

​

“Hello, how are you?”

​

“I’m fine. Didn’t sleep much, though.”

​

“Oh, is fatigue the reason you greeted me so strangely? What did you do last night?”

​

Allison got that confused look on her face again, she mumbled something I couldn’t hear, and shut her eyes tightly while grabbing her head like she had a headache. Before I could snap her out of it, she returned to her normal cheerful self and said,” Oh come on, Jeff, how could you forget our in-joke? You laughed your ass off, first and only time I’ve seen you crack up like that.”

​

It was now my turn to be confused. I hadn’t specified a reason why she said it in the sheet. Then all of a sudden, a memory made itself known in my head, yes, Allison and I had gone to the same elementary school, she had said that for no reason whatsoever to me one day at recess. I remembered laughing so hard I almost threw up.

​

I had a headache; the memory was fighting with what I knew to be true. I opened a note on my phone and wrote, “I do not know Allison, disregard the memory.” Before allowing the new memory to settle into my head with little resistance. I had more things to test after all.

​

“So did you see the game last night?” I asked.

​

“Oh yeah, really impressive win too,” she replied.

​

She was being incredibly vague; to be honest, I was unsure if it was football season right now, and it seemed like Allison didn’t know either, but had to stick to her characterization.

​

“Um, who was playing last night? I didn’t get a chance to watch.”



“The Marlins and The Cowboys,” she answered.​



I had the vague notion that the Marlins were a baseball team, but I was unsure if I was correct. I wanted to ask more questions, but I found testing this question was difficult. I couldn’t ask questions about a subject I knew nothing about.

​

With one question left to test, I asked,” Have you played the new Battlefield game that just came out? Battlefield 5, I think?”

​

“Actually, it’s Battlefield 6, and yeah, of course I did. Why do you think I was up so late last night?”

​

“What do you like about it?”

​

In response to my question, she rattled off a list of things she liked and didn’t like about the game. I half listened to her; the conversation was nostalgic. It reminded me of Jason, always talking about the stats of guns and other things in that category, while I got my ass handed to me. I felt the vague need to know how he was doing at his new school, but smothered it.

​

Allison eventually stopped talking and looked at me like she wanted to ask a question.

​

“Well, I’m glad you’re enjoying the game.”

​

“You know, Jeff, I was pretty sad when we went to separate middle schools. I know we weren’t super great friends back then, but ever since I ran into you yesterday, I just can’t stop thinking about you.” She paused with a vacant look in her eyes before finishing,” Did you do something to me?”

​

My entire body went cold, and I felt a pit in my stomach. Had I been caught? What would I even have done? She couldn’t prove anything.

​

Allison saw the panicked look on my face and burst out laughing,” Oh my god, Jeff, did you really do something to me? Well, no, you couldn’t have. I was trying to be all poetic about confessing to you, idiot. Like, did you charm me or something? Goddamn, I forgot you have all the people skills of a rock.”

​

Her response baffled me more than anything she had said previously. Everything so far had lined up with what I had written, but there was no way in hell I had even thought about making such an annoying girl fall for me. I found the very thought revolting.

​

She grew impatient with my silence and started up again,” So are you going to say anything? I don’t have all day to stand around waiting.”

​

“I’m just confused, is all. Why do you like me?”

​

“Oh my god, were you even listening to me? I just said I keep thinking about you, no matter how much I try not to. I’ve never really been in love before, but like, isn’t this it?”

​

Ah, she had rationalized things. I had been thinking about her, and in turn, she had thought of me. She compartmentalized it and labeled it love. I told her to give me a moment, and I pulled up her character sheet. I wrote,”does not think of Jeff as any more than a friend.”

​

As soon as I punched those words into my phone, Allison crumpled to the floor. I got out of my seat in a panic and knelt down over her, expecting the worst. I breathed a sigh of relief when she opened her eyes and said,” Man, I guess I stayed up too late.”

​

“Do you often pass out when you don’t sleep enough?”

​

“No, never. Actually, ugh, I’m saying stupid things because I just woke up. Yeah, I do. Always have.”

​

I helped her up and then asked,” So what do you remember from before you woke up?”

​

“I was talking about Battlefield and then bam, I was on the floor. Or wait, maybe the topic changed? Mom always says I tend to forget the minute or so that passes before I go down.”

​

“You didn’t forget anything, you were just talking about Battlefield for a really long time,”I lied. One less headache. Still, if things don’t work exactly how I expect, it wouldn’t be too bad to ask her one last question.

​

“Actually, uh, you mentioned something about thinking about me all last night? Right before you collapsed.”

​

“Oh yeah, I was just really happy to meet a friend from when I was a kid. Kept thinking about how much you changed,”she laughed a bit.

​

I was lying on my bed looking at the note I had written.

​

“I do not know Allison, disregard the memory.”

​

I knew there was no possibility that I had known Allison before going to this school. My own actions wouldn’t make sense. Why would I need to research a girl I already knew quite well? Wouldn’t she have noticed me the first day she sat near me? Too many things didn’t line up rationally, but I remembered. It wasn’t just the one memory, either; every time I thought about it more, I seemed to come up with more and more impossible memories. How could I be her childhood friend when she lived several states away, and I had lived in this state all my life? My questions didn’t seem to matter. I remembered meeting Allison, and that simple fact destroyed my mountains of evidence.

​

There was a loophole. I may have remembered meeting Allison, but Emily was a different story. If I rationalized them as two separate people, I could get around it. It was difficult, as I thought about Emily; sometimes, I would think about Allison instead. I was wary about writing it down; I was unsure if I would accidentally cause a change. However, if I didn’t write it down, it’s possible I would accept something totally fabricated. I wrote down my own past as best as I could remember. Reading it back now, I get the feeling that I may have misremembered some parts, but if it was a genuine false memory, I could accept it.

​

I hated Jason enough that I had no doubt of my memories from that time; I had never written about it, and it was safe. I had never written about the creation of Allison either; my memories of the person in question were probably wrong, but the surrounding events were ones I felt sure about. Still, it took me a while to write about it all. I kept getting confused as to why I did what I did.

​

Looking back at my actions, I suppose reality works in the same way my writing does. “She” doesn’t just do things because I write them; “she” has a motivation for doing things, and if it doesn’t exist, reality changes itself so that motivation does. I ended up getting caught in the crossfire this time because I was too vague. For the next set of tests, I needed to include reasons why she would do things.
