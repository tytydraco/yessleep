Back then I worked as a high school teacher. I had just finished college and started working only part-time, as I was not that easy to find a full-time position right in the middle of the school year. Luckily for me, someone at a school nearby had to quit on short notice, and I was hired as a stand in immediately. The job required me to teach only a few hours each week, leaving me with quite a bit of free time. This of course I perceived as mainly positive, as I was then still actively painting – something I don’t really do anymore. The first strokes of paint on an empty canvas upset me now… You’ll understand soon enough.

The position at school enabled me to work on a bigger painting I had planned out during the month before. The few lessons I taught didn’t require too much preparation, as I could reuse teaching materials I had created in college. While I was really happy to have time to fully engage in my hobby, I couldn’t really ignore the downside of having only a part-time job – money was sparse. After having received my first paycheck, I realized that the number written on it wouldn’t suffice at all. The rent for my small house wasn’t that high, but still. I needed to eat and… Well, art supplies were ridiculously expensive.

After a bit of thinking I decided that it wouldn’t hurt to have a housemate around. Not only could they help me out with rent, but ideally also provide me some company. After all, it would be nice to talk to someone over the age of sixteen – the conversations I had with my students were usually not that demanding. And I didn’t have any friends close by which I could easily meet at a bar in the evening. A week after my decision to search for a housemate, I coincidentally overheard one of my coworkers explaining how annoyed she was by her freshly divorced brother, who had ‘temporarily’ moved in with her. Apparently, he was in low spirits constantly – something that she primarily perceived as exhausting. I saw my chance, spoke to her, and greeted my new housemate only a few hours later. Lex was about my age – mid-twenties – and I soon found out that he was equally unhappy having to live with his sister, as she was to live with him. He moved in and we immediately got along well. With both of us not being too extroverted, we wouldn’t annoy each other with unnecessary small talk. Nonetheless, he’d suggest having a beer together on from time to time, something that quickly became a routine I was looking forward to.

So, that was my life in March of 2012. I was 28, living with Lex, teaching history lessons every other weekday and painting in my generous free time. To be honest, my life was pretty unproblematic, and I wish I would have just stayed that way.

.

The small spot on the wall of my room was located close to my easel. I think, I saw it first on one of the last days of march. When exactly, I’m not sure. It was just a tiny, grayish-blue speckle at about my height, in the middle of the wall. Upon seeing it, I was a bit annoyed, as this probably meant that I would have to repaint that wall if I was to move out some time in the future. This meant only a small inconvenience and was something that I could worry about in the future. I pushed the thought aside and continued painting. The fact that I hadn’t used gray in my paintings in a while didn’t really cross my mind.

**^(.)**

Within the first week of April, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the weird spot seemed a little bigger than it was the days before. *Had it always been the size of my fingernail?* I thought, as I lifted my arm, wanting to scratch it off. Just before I touched it, I suddenly got the idea that it might be mold. I mean, a drop of paint on the wall surely wouldn’t *grow*, right? Disgusted, I pulled my hand back.

As I wasn’t the only one in my household to make administrative decisions now, I decided to listen to Lex's opinion on the weird spot before calling a professional cleaner. I went on about my day, taught some tenth graders about the French Revolution and nearly forgot about it. After I came home that evening, I was reminded of the small round problem on my wall immediately, as it didn’t seem to be that *small* anymore. Now I was staring at a spot about the size of a coin. I called out to Lex. After explaining my theory that we probably had mold on the walls and therefore should call a professional cleaner, Lex just shrugged, reached out, and tried to scratch it off with his fingernail. “Man, I can’t get it off, what kind of aggressive paint do you use for your paintings?” he exclaimed annoyed. I once more explained that I hadn’t used that color in any of my paintings, and that I thought it must be mold. „Hmm, yeah, it had a moldy consistency when I touched it, yes. You better call a cleaner while I wash my hands. “

The cleaning company told me that they would send someone the next day in the afternoon. Even though I had no idea what this spot was, I wasn’t too thrilled about sleeping in the room it was in. The fact that it grew so fast just gave me a bad feeling. Hoping to solve the problem tomorrow with the help of a cleaner, I finally managed to fall asleep.

**^(.)**

Slowly waking up the following day, I dreaded the moment of opening my eyes. I was so sure that the thing must have gotten bigger again, but – it wasn’t. Sure, it was still there, but its size hadn’t changed much. At least not significantly. Motivated by this first impression of the day, I quickly got up to tell Lex about it. I met him in the kitchen. Lex didn’t seem too interested in the apparently slowing – or stopping? – growth of the thing, as he seemed to be occupied with something else. “Yeah, that’s greats and all man, but please have a look at my finger now. It feels so weird… To be honest, it really hurts.” I looked at his hand. The upper third of his right index finger now had the same grayish and slightly blue color as the spot on the wall. “You’ve probably cleaned it as best as possible, right?” I asked. “What do you think, doc?” he mumbled sarcastically. „Of course I cleaned it, but it’s no use. And I don’t see myself working today with my hand looking like this. I’ll call in sick. I’m in my room if you need me.” Then he left. Lex worked as a chiropractor, so I understood why it wouldn’t be the best Idea to touch clients with his hands like that.

While I still stood in the kitchen – quite confused by what was happening – the phone rang. It was the cleaning company. They explained that one of their cleaners had gotten sick and then asked if it would be okay if they send another, who would be at my house tomorrow. I sighed and agreed. The spot didn’t seem to grow any further, so my biggest concern was Lex's hand anyway. But I had to rush to work first.

After I had finished school, I stopped at his favorite Chinese restaurant and ordered food for us. I wanted to do at least something to make his day a little better. Back home, I went to Lex's room right away. „Hey man, you there? I brought us some food,” I said, knocking on the door. He told me to come in. I took a few steps into the room and placed the bag with the food on his desk, then I noticed how pale he was. “It really is not looking good.” I saw that Lex was trying to play it somewhat cool, but his tone immediately told me how upset he was. Then I saw his finger. Or, better say, I didn’t see his finger. Most of it looked like it had rotted away… left was only a little stump, the same color that a part of his hand, as well as the lower half of his middle finger had now assumed. I took a step back. “Shit, Lex, you must go to the hospital immediately!” I told him. „Yes, I know. But I feel so tired, I just can’t get up myself. Maybe I need a bit more rest.” “Great Idea, just rest and then maybe go to the hospital later, without your hand,” I replied angrily. I didn’t want to scare him any further but looking at his hand I immediately got shivers again. Seeing his frightened and pale face, I immediately felt sorry for what I had said. “Okay, that was a joke, of course. But I think we should do something and not just wait it out. You need some energy, so I’ll fetch you a fork and you eat a bit of the food I just brought. And after that, we go straight to the hospital, okay?”

“Okay.”

**.: . '.**

I went to the kitchen, opened a drawer, and grabbed a fork. Amid the shiny cutlery, something dark caught my eye. There was another spot of the same color, in our cutlery drawer. I suddenly felt a bit sick. Then it hit me. Lex must have touched it. I jerked back and looked at my hand. There were no irritations, I hadn’t accidentally touched it. While I tried to sort my thoughts – I didn’t know of any skin disease that infected wood as well, it didn’t make any sense – I noticed something. There were more spots. On the coffee-machine, the counter, the fridge. All of these probably touched by Lex in the morning. I grabbed an oven mitt and went back to his room. “Okay, I’m sorry, but forget the food. And please put this over your hand.” I handed him the mitt. “We need to leave, now.”

I helped Lex into my car, extremely careful not to touch his hand. At the hospital, the staff led Lex to a doctor’s office. The waiting room emptied, as the evening approached, but Lex didn’t show up. After I had waited for about three hours, I asked the nurses how much longer it would take. They explained that my friend was getting the best treatment, he would be fine soon – but I didn’t have to wait for him. He had to stay overnight. This I understood, still having the vivid image of his missing finger in my head. I then asked if I could quickly see him. Just to let him know that he wasn’t alone, going through this. The nurses said that this wouldn’t be possible. Apparently, he was sleeping, and it would be best if no one disturbed his rest.

With an uneasy feeling in my stomach, I drove home. The things the nurses told me made sense and – as I wasn’t a family member – they were not required to give me more information on his condition and sickness. I simply couldn’t wrap my head around the fact that this… virus? had simply consumed a human finger. As I continued my drive, I realized that I absolutely didn’t want to sleep in our house that night. I wasn’t sure where else to go, but I ultimately decided, that a hotel room would be the best short-term solution. It would be expensive, but better than potentially having any rotten limbs. Still, I needed to quickly stop at the house and grab my wallet, which I had forgotten in the hurry. We had a little desk right besides the door for keys, wallets and what not. Pretty sure that my wallet must be laying there, I started to mentally prepare myself to enter the house.

**:.‘..:**

I hadn’t even reached our driveway, but from the distance I could already see it. A blue van with a big logo stood in front of our home. The logo consisted of a stylized broom, a sponge, and some shiny stars. I stopped my car as fast as possible, opened the door and ran towards the house. Then I remembered something. I quickly rushed back to the car, grabbed my gloves from the glove compartment, and put them on. Apart from my face, all my skin was now covered by my clothes.

As I bust into the house, I heard several people talking in my room. Passing the kitchen door, I quickly made sure that it was fully shut. Then I went into my room. On the floor there were some buckets, spray cans and other things that one might expect a cleaning team to bring. Next to them stood two men in blue overalls and, to my shock, my landlady.

“Ah, there you are. You really didn’t have to make such a fuzz about such a small spot on the wall. It seems to be a bit of dirt or paint, don’t worry about it,” my landlady said.

All I managed to get out was: “How did you get in here?”

Again, the friendly woman answered: “Oh, the cleaning company told me that you called because of some mold. They wanted to send someone before today’s shift ended, but they couldn’t reach you via landline. Luckily, I answered the phone and let them in.”

“You really don’t have to be that afraid of a bit of dirt, young man,” one of the men approached me. “As the woman said, it’s no mold. Tomorrow, you go and buy some white paint and the problem is solved.”

The men grabbed their stuff and slowly went out of the room. While my landlady again assured me that there was nothing to worry about, that it was better to be safe than sorry and that she wasn’t mad about the bill of the cleaning service, I heard the men talking.

“Huh, this sure is hard to get off… I don’t even wanna know what that weird guy smeared on his walls, ugh.” The other man answered. “Yeah, I also got a bit of it on my hand. I’ll try to rub it off at home, using the strong stuff…” They left.

My landlady went after them and left me alone in my room. I stared at the wall. The spot still had the size of a coin. I stood there for a few minutes. Then I went to the kitchen.

There were so many. The ones that I had seen before now had an equal size to the one in my bedroom, but there were more. It was the same in the bathroom. They were on the faucet, the mirror, button you flush the toilet with. I couldn’t help but feel thankful for my decision to go straight to Lex's room this afternoon.

Then I grabbed my wallet and left.

 

 In the hotel I immediately fell asleep. The next day I called in the hospital. It was surreal. No one knew what I was talking about, they said they never heard Lex's name. After a few minutes of me desperately trying to explain myself, they asked me to please stop blocking the line and hung up. I drove there, but even in person it was impossible to get any information.

I started to wonder if I had just made this story up, if maybe something was wrong with me. Eventually I decided to drive back home.

In front of the house stood two black cars with men in equally black suits in them. They didn’t allow me to enter. They said they were sorry, but the house couldn’t be entered by civilians under any circumstances. I was outnumbered and saw no way to get in. To be honest, I didn’t even want to get in. After some time, I went back to the hotel.

**.**

I lay on the hotel bed for a long time. Probably hours. I couldn’t comprehend what was happening. Nothing made sense. Then I saw it. A little speck on the ceiling. It had the same weird light gray, blue color. I felt as if I was going crazy. As fast as I could I grabbed my things and left. I drove for hours.

 

 I arrived at my parents’ house about eight or nine hours later. By the time I arrived, I had developed a fever. After that, I don’t remember much.

 By the end of April, I had gotten better. My parents told me that the school had called a few days after my arrival at their house, asking where I was. No one else called. Not my Landlady, not Lex.

 

All of this happened more than ten years ago now. I never went back to my old house or that city. Nobody required me to pay any rent, or anything else. Today I live a relatively happy life – except for the fact that I had to give up painting. It just stressed me out so much. Also, I’m obsessing over the cleanliness of my home… at least my wife says so. I’ve never heard from Lex again.
