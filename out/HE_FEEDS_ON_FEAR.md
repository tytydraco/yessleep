I wanted to make this as quick as possible. This is a warning to anyone who might try to feed him. Unfortunately, against my will, I have to alert you—who are now reading this text. Don’t see me as a bad guy; I’m just trying to survive. I was thrown into this situation, but I’ll try to help you here. It’s better that you read this all the way through. Otherwise, you’ll have to deal with him, just like I did in the beginning.  
If you’ve made it this far, I have sad news: you are cursed. Yes, now you know about him, and because of that, you are trapped in this curse. I’m sorry, but your life is over. You will never have peace again, and your family will also become his victims.  
I’ve heard many reports about people who disappeared out of nowhere, entire families vanishing without explanation. That’s exactly what will happen to you if you don’t listen to me.  
He feeds on fear. Throughout all of human history, this abomination has nourished itself on people’s terror, especially those who talk about him. In ancient times, people avoided even mentioning his existence. At first, he will simply observe you in the darkness. You’ll see his red eyes at every corner, every street, every place. At first, he will appear only at night. But the more strength you give him—that is, the more fear you feel or if you dare look at him directly—the stronger he becomes.  
Let me warn you: no one else will see this creature, only you. If you try to ask for help, they’ll think you’ve gone insane. You’ll end up locked in a madhouse, with him watching you through the solitary window—his favorite place. He doesn’t want to kill you right away because that would be too easy. Instead, he will destroy your sanity. Only after that might he eliminate you. Or maybe not even that; he might simply make you disappear.  
Everything will start going wrong in your life. Your girlfriend will cheat on you—and he’ll be there, laughing. Your mother might die—and he’ll be at the funeral, mocking you. Your boss could fire you, and your friends will turn against you. He will always be there, laughing, because he is the very embodiment of evil.  
At first, you’ll see his eyes in the darkness of your room, usually in the darkest corner. He is a shapeshifter, but his natural form is indescribably horrible. Usually, the first time he appears will be when you try to sleep. On your first night, he might reveal his true form: a being two meters tall, with the body of a man and the head of a goat. He resembles Beelzebub but far more terrifying. His skin is wet, slippery, covered with black, viscous scales that shine grotesquely. His red eyes radiate pure evil and malice. He breathes heavily and irregularly, letting out muffled growls, as if trying not to make unnecessary noise. When he speaks, it will be in a language older than time itself.  
This is when the “game” begins. From then on, he will stop only when you are completely destroyed. The best way out, perhaps, is death. But even then, I doubt he will let you rest in the afterlife.

Now that you understand the cruel reality, I’ll tell you how it all started for me.  
An ex-friend from college sent me a strange message—one of those internet chain letters that say, “If you don’t share this, something terrible will happen.” But this message was different. It came with a photo of that thing: the two-meter creature with a goat’s face. I was intrigued because she was never the type to make tasteless jokes. She was a serious woman.  
That same night, I dreamed of him. I woke up sweating. I went to work, and early in the morning, I saw old classmates posting mourning messages. When I found out who it was, I felt like I had been punched in the stomach: it was my friend, the same one who had sent the message. She had taken her own life. Thinking back now, after everything, I began to wonder: are people who take their own lives somehow cursed by him?  
That night, coming home, there was a storm. I lived alone, and the wind made the windows rattle. As soon as I entered, I saw something. He was there, hidden in the darkest part of the pantry, where the light didn’t reach. His glowing red eyes stared at me. Rainwater dripped down his horrid face.  
The moment I stepped in, the air turned heavy, almost suffocating, as if the atmosphere itself was trying to stop me from moving forward. And then I saw him. He was crouched in the darkest part of the pantry, where not even the weak light from the storm dared touch.  
His eyes were two burning points of infernal red, clawing into me, unblinking. There was something both animalistic and deliberately human in that stare—a hunger, a perverse intelligence that made fear pulse through my veins.  
The rain trickled slowly down his grotesque face, sliding over crevices that looked more like open wounds than facial features. His skin was a repulsive mix of wet flesh and something that seemed to be disintegrating, exuding a sweet, rotting smell that made my stomach churn.  
Droplets of water dripped from the tips of his deformed claws, which seemed carved from pure hatred, long and sharp like rusted blades.  
He didn’t move, but there was a vibration in the air around him, as though the darkness itself was alive and bending to his will. Then I realized that the rain dripping from him wasn’t coming from the ceiling—it seemed to emanate from the creature itself, as if the sky cried through him, feeding his abominable form.  
A lightning flash illuminated the room for a split second, and I saw more: teeth, impossibly jagged, ready to tear through flesh and bone, and a hunched body made of joints that didn’t belong in this world. It was as though he had been hastily stitched together by blind and cruel hands.  
A low, wet sound echoed from the creature, something between a growl and a gurgle, as if it were choking on something viscous and alive.  
I wanted to run, but my legs were frozen in place. His red eyes burned in the darkness like embers, stripping me of all courage.  
And then, slowly, he tilted his head, as if studying me... or deciding how I should die.  
As the lightning illuminated the pantry in that fleeting instant, I saw his grotesque mouth stretch into a smile—if you could call that a smile. The torn, irregular lips parted to reveal sharp, crooked teeth, shining with something far too slimy to be saliva.  
And then came the sound.  
It was laughter. Not human. Not natural. A cacophony of distorted noises that echoed through the small space like a macabre chorus. It began as a low gurgle, almost a choke, but quickly grew, transforming into something that sounded like a fragmented echo of a laugh.  
It was as if the creature didn’t know how to laugh but was imitating something it had heard before—wrongly and deliberately disturbingly.  
The laughter seemed to come from all sides, filling the air with a dark vibration. My ears rang, and the sensation that the sound wasn’t just heard but felt sent chills down to my bones. It was as though every note of that laughter was mocking me. **EXPOSING MY FEAR, MY HELPLESSNESS, MY INSIGNIFICANCE BEFORE IT.**

And then it tilted its head to the side, its red eyes glowing even more intensely, as though they were piercing deep into my soul. It didn’t move, but there was a vibration in the air around it, as if the very darkness were alive and bowed to its will. And then I realized that the rain streaming from it didn’t come from the ceiling—it seemed to emanate from the creature itself, as if the sky wept through it, feeding its abominable form.

A lightning flash illuminated the room for a fleeting moment, and I saw more: impossibly jagged teeth, ready to tear through flesh and bone, and a hunched body composed of joints that didn’t belong to this world. It was as though it had been hastily stitched together by blind and cruel hands.  
A low, wet sound echoed from the creature, something between a growl and a gurgle, as though it were choking on something viscous and alive.  
I wanted to run, but my legs were frozen in place. Its red eyes burned in the darkness like embers, stripping me of all courage. And then, slowly, it tilted its head, as if studying me... or deciding how I should die.

As the lightning flashed through the pantry for a brief, fleeting second, I saw its grotesque mouth stretch into a smile—if you could even call it a smile. Its torn, jagged lips parted to reveal sharp, crooked teeth, glistening with something far too viscous to be saliva.  
And then, came the sound.

It was laughter. Not human. Not natural. A cacophony of distorted sounds that echoed in the small space like a macabre chorus. It started as a low gurgle, almost a choke, but quickly grew, transforming into something that sounded like a fragmented echo of laughter. It was as if the creature didn’t know how to laugh but was imitating something it had heard before—wrongly and deliberately disturbing.  
The laughter seemed to come from all sides, filling the air with a dark vibration. My ears rang, and the sensation that the sound wasn’t just heard but *felt* sent chills through my bones. It was as though every note of that laughter mocked me, exposing my fear, my helplessness, my insignificance before it.

And then it tilted its head again, the red eyes shining even brighter, like they were rooted in the depths of my soul. The laughter continued, an endless sound, broken only by the sound of rain dripping off its decrepit skin, pattering on the floor in rhythms almost synchronized with that horrible guttural noise.

It didn’t advance, didn’t move—it just laughed, as if savoring the terror emanating from me.

That was the moment I made my biggest mistake. What did I say? *“It feeds on fear. It wants to be noticed.”* And what did I do? Of course, I tried to get close to it. I grabbed the broom and tried to hit it. I was still thinking that this was all in my head, imagining that maybe it was just a wild animal. I swung the broom, but in reality, I didn’t even get close.

The thing let out an impossible scream, unlike any creature on Earth. It sounded like the roar of a lion mixed with the wailing of a woman pulled straight from humanity’s worst nightmares. When it opened its mouth, it looked like it had millions of teeth. I thought that thing was going to devour me whole.

I’m not ashamed to admit it: I pissed and crapped myself. Literally. When the creature sensed my fear, it began laughing again. It was a sound similar to a goat’s, but layered with the laugh of an 80-year-old man. Then it disappeared into the darkness, those red eyes and that yellow mouth fading, still laughing.

Now you’ll understand why that was the worst thing I’ve ever done. At that moment, the creature gained total power over me. The days that followed were progressively worse. Every night, it screamed with that inhuman sound.

I called the police, but, as I said, they couldn’t see the thing. Only I could see it. The creature seemed to enjoy watching me, even when I showered. When I tried to look at it, the thing hid. It also loved spying on me through the window, scratching at the glass and laughing. Its laugh was inhuman, muffled, like the sound of an old man drowning.

Every night, it positioned itself at my bedroom window, its impossibly long, thin fingers tracing crooked lines on the glass. The claws scraped irregularly, producing a metallic, irritating sound that seemed to vibrate inside my skull. Occasionally, it would stop scratching and lightly knock on the glass with its knuckles, a hollow, disturbing sound, as if to remind me it was still there. Its eyes never blinked, and I knew that, even when I turned away to avoid its gaze, it didn’t look away.

It just stayed there, watching me, as if every second was a banquet of terror it relished. Sometimes, it pressed its face against the glass, so forcefully that its sticky skin would leave distorted marks that remained even when the sun rose.

Then came the cascade of misfortunes. First, I was fired from my job. My colleagues started avoiding me, whispering behind my back about how “something was wrong with me.” My boss, who had been understanding, started acting strange, looking at me as if I were a monster. When he called me into his office to fire me, I noticed fresh scratch marks on the wall behind him—marks that only I seemed to see.

My father died of a heart attack, and I knew the creature was responsible. When I found him, his eyes were wide open in pure terror, as though he had seen Hell itself. On the wall, just above where he lay, there was a message written in something dark and viscous: *“You’re next.”*

My mother... What happened to her was even worse. She didn’t die. She vanished.

The next morning, I went into her room, and it was empty. The room looked like it had been the setting of a nightmare. The mirror was cracked, and claw marks covered the walls and floor, forming chaotic patterns, as if something had danced there in a wicked frenzy. The most horrifying thing was the mark on the window: a long, deformed hand pressed against the glass, as if the creature had passed through. There were no signs of struggle, no sound the night before—just emptiness.

That night, the creature returned. I was still in my parents’ house. It was night. The sound of claws scratching the glass came from all directions, but when I looked at the window, I saw nothing. It was as though it was toying with me, relishing every drop of my despair.

Then, suddenly, the sound stopped. The silence that followed was even worse, so absolute it felt like the world had stopped breathing. When I turned to the door, it was there. The creature, in all its grotesque deformity, filled the space with its presence.

But this time, something was different. In its long, twisted hands, it held something that made me lose the ability to scream. It was my mother’s head.

Her expression was frozen in a silent scream, her eyes wide and glassy, but the most disturbing part was that she still looked alive. Her mouth trembled, emitting broken sounds, as if she were trying to say something.

The creature lifted her head higher, showing it like a trophy, and then it began to speak—through my mother’s mouth. Fragmented, indecipherable words escaped her lips, a sound wet and suffocated, like something rising from the depths of a swamp.

The creature’s claws moved slowly, stroking her hair, while that “dialogue” continued. Then, my mother’s head turned toward me. Her dead eyes met mine, and a distorted, forced smile appeared on her face. It wasn’t my mother smiling. It was the creature, wearing her face like a mask.

The creature didn’t just destroy my life; it became my only company. Wherever I go, it’s there, always watching.

That’s why I’m writing this. Not for help—help will never come—but to warn you.

If you hear scratching at your window tonight, or muffled laughter coming from nowhere, turn off the lights and pray. Pray that it’s not too late. Pray that it isn’t looking at you like it’s looking at me now.
