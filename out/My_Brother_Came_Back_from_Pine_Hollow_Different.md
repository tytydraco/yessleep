The search party found Danny sitting cross-legged in a clearing about two miles into Pine Hollow, right where the old logging road dead-ends into nothing but bramble and pine. Four hours he'd been gone. Four hours since he'd wandered away from our campsite to take a piss and never came back.

He was drawing in the dirt with a stick when they found him. Deputy Morris said Danny didn't even look up when they called his name. Just kept dragging that stick through the soil, over and over, making the same shape. A circle with lines radiating out from the center, like a child's drawing of the sun, except the lines were too precise, too evenly spaced. Twelve of them, exactly.

Mom cried when they brought him back. Dad just stood there with his hands in his pockets, jaw working like he was chewing on words he couldn't spit out. I remember thinking Danny looked tired. More than tired. Hollowed out somehow, like something had scooped away everything behind his eyes and left just enough to keep him upright.

"Are you okay?" I asked him.

Danny turned to look at me, and for just a second—I swear to God—I didn't recognize my own brother. Then he smiled, and it was his smile again, crooked on the left side where he'd chipped his tooth falling off the tire swing when he was seven.

"Yeah," he said. "I'm okay."

But his voice came out wrong. Flatter. Like he was reading from a script written in a language he didn't quite understand.

---

We drove home in silence. Danny sat in the back seat beside me, staring out the window. His hands rested on his knees, palms down, fingers spread wide. I watched him the whole drive, waiting for him to do something, say something, but he just stared. The trees blurred past in the late afternoon light, and Danny's reflection in the glass looked like it belonged to someone older. Someone I'd never met.

When we got home, Mom made him take a shower and checked him over for ticks, scratches, anything that might explain where he'd been or what had happened. She found nothing. Not a mark on him. His clothes weren't even dirty, which didn't make sense. Pine Hollow was all blackberry tangles and rotting logs, mud that sucked at your boots and branches that clawed at your face. You couldn't walk ten feet in there without coming out looking like you'd been in a fight.

"Maybe he just got turned around," Dad said that night, after Danny had gone to bed. "Got scared, sat down to wait. He's fine."

Mom didn't answer. She was looking at the notepad on the kitchen table. While we'd been making dinner, Danny had sat there with a pencil and drawn that symbol again. And again. And again. Dozens of them, covering the entire page in neat, obsessive rows. Each one identical. Each one perfect.

---

The next morning, I found Danny in the garage.

He was crouched in the corner by Dad's toolbench, drawing the symbol on the concrete floor with a piece of charcoal from the grill. His pajamas were smudged black. He'd been at it for a while—the symbol covered maybe three square feet, rendered in careful, deliberate strokes.

"Danny?"

He didn't stop. Just kept filling in the lines, his hand moving with mechanical precision.

I stepped closer. In the morning light bleeding through the garage door window, I could see details I'd missed before. The lines radiating from the center weren't just lines. They were segmented, divided into smaller sections by tiny cross-hatches. Like something was being measured. Counted.

"What is that?" I asked.

Danny's hand paused. He tilted his head, and I heard his neck crack—a sound like green wood splitting.

"I don't know," he said softly. "But I have to finish it."

"Finish what?"

He didn't answer. Just went back to drawing.

By the end of the week, our parents took him to three different doctors. Physical exam, blood work, CT scan. Everything came back normal. One doctor suggested trauma response, another mentioned dissociative episodes. The child psychologist asked Danny to draw what he was feeling.

He drew the symbol.

"It's probably just his way of processing the experience," the psychologist told our parents. "Children often fixate on patterns when they're trying to regain a sense of control."

But Danny wasn't trying to control anything. He was obeying something. I could see it in the way he moved—like he was being pulled by invisible threads. He'd be in the middle of eating dinner and suddenly stop, fork halfway to his mouth, eyes going distant. Then he'd set down the fork, excuse himself, and go find something to draw with.

He drew on napkins. On the backs of homework assignments. On the condensation that formed on the bathroom mirror after showers. Once, I caught him in the backyard at two in the morning, using a stick to carve the symbol into the dirt, over and over, in a spiral pattern that stretched fifteen feet across the grass.

"Danny, you need to sleep," I said.

He looked at me, and in the moonlight, I saw how much older he looked. Not just older. Wrong. His face had changed in ways I couldn't articulate. The proportions were the same, but there was something in the architecture of his features that didn't belong to a twelve-year-old kid anymore. Something ancient and exhausted.

"I can't," he whispered. "Not until I finish."

"Finish what?"

His mouth opened, then closed. Opened again. Like he was trying to remember how to form words.

"The count," he finally said.

I started researching Pine Hollow. There wasn't much—just a few scattered mentions in local history forums and some old newspaper archives. The logging operation shut down in the forties after a string of accidents. Men disappearing for hours, sometimes days, showing up later with no memory of where they'd been. One logger supposedly came back speaking in backwards sentences. Another carved strange symbols into every tree within a mile of his house before his wife found him hanging in the barn.

I found a photograph from 1947, black and white and water-damaged, showing a group of loggers standing in front of a half-cut pine. Someone had carved something into the bark. I had to zoom in, squint at the grainy image, but when I finally made it out, my stomach dropped.

It was Danny's symbol. Exactly the same.

---

He stopped eating on day nine.

Mom begged him, cried, threatened to take him to the hospital. Danny just sat at the table, staring at his plate, hands folded in his lap. His wrists looked too thin. His cheeks had hollowed out. He'd lost weight—more than should be possible in nine days. More than made sense.

"I'm not hungry," he said in that flat, distant voice.

That night, I woke up to find him standing in my room.

He was at the foot of my bed, perfectly still, head tilted at an unnatural angle. The moonlight coming through my window painted him in shades of blue and black. His eyes reflected the light like an animal's.

"Danny?"

"It's almost done," he whispered. "Six more."

"Six more what?"

He turned and walked out without answering. I heard him go downstairs. Heard the back door open and close. When I looked out my window, I saw him in the backyard, drawing the symbol in the dirt again, but this time he was adding something to the center. A shape I couldn't make out from this distance. Something that looked almost like a doorway.

---

On day twelve, Danny finished.

I don't know how I knew—I just did. I woke up that morning and felt it, a pressure in the air like the moment before a thunderstorm breaks. I went to Danny's room and found him sitting on his bed, hands resting on his knees, staring at the wall.

He'd drawn the symbol there. Big this time, maybe four feet across, rendered in what looked like charcoal and something darker. Something wet.

"Danny?"

He turned to look at me, and I saw tears running down his face. Not sad tears. Something else. Relief, maybe. Or terror so complete it had burned through to the other side.

"I counted them all," he said. His voice sounded like his again—really his, for the first time since Pine Hollow. "Every single one. Twelve thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven."

"Twelve thousand what?"

Danny smiled. Not his crooked smile. Something wider. Something that showed too many teeth.

"The things that were waiting," he said. "I had to count them so they'd know. So they'd know we were ready."

He stood up, and I noticed his shadow on the wall. It was wrong. Too long. Too many angles. And it was moving independently, stretching toward the symbol he'd drawn, reaching for that dark center that looked more and more like an opening the longer I stared at it.

"Danny, what did you do?"

My brother—my little brother who used to be afraid of the dark, who slept with a nightlight until he was ten—looked at me with eyes that were ancient and empty and full of something I didn't have words for.

"I finished counting," he said. "Now they can come through."

The symbol on the wall began to pulse.

---

That was six months ago.

Danny's been in a specialized facility downstate ever since. The doctors say he's catatonic, that he just sits in his room drawing the symbol over and over, never speaking, never eating unless they force him. They don't know what's wrong. They've stopped trying to figure it out.

But I know.

And I know something else, too.

Last week, I started seeing the symbol. Not Danny's drawings—new ones. Carved into trees at the park. Spray-painted on the overpass downtown. Scratched into the condensation on car windows.

Other people are drawing it now.

I don't know how many. I don't know if they've been to Pine Hollow, or if this is something else, something that spreads differently. But they're counting too. I can see it in their eyes when I pass them on the street—that same hollow, exhausted look Danny had. That same ancient patience.

Whatever Danny counted, whatever he opened—

I think it's still coming through.

And I think we're running out of time to stop it.
