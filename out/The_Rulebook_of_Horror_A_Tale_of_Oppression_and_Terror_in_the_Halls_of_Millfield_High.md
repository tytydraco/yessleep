As I arrived on the first day of the new school year, I couldn't help but feel a sense of déjà vu. I was in the same old town, doing the same thing as I had done every year before. But as I walked through the doors of Millfield High, I realized that this year was going to be anything but normal.

As I was given my schedule, I noticed that it wasn't just a list of my classes and teachers. There was also a list of rules, starting with Rule #1: "Don't be late to class." If you are, refer to Rule #1A. I was confused and a little concerned, but I figured it was just a joke or some kind of prank.

But as I read on, the rules became more and more disturbing. Rule #1A instructed me to hide in a stall and wait until the end of the period, praying that no one would find me. And if they did? Well, the rule didn't say, but the implication was clear: I didn't want to know what would happen.

Rule #2 was just as unsettling. It stated that there was no Class 13, and if my schedule changed, I was to go to the office and they would "fix it." But the real horror came in the last line: "If you go to Class 13, we will find your body, even if it's in pieces :)."

I couldn't believe what I was reading. This couldn't be real, I thought. It had to be some kind of prank. But as I looked around the room, I saw the same fear and confusion on the faces of my classmates.

And then there was Rule #3: "If you ever hear code sliver Listen to your teacher." I had no idea what "code sliver" meant, but the fear in the eyes of the students around me told me that it was something to be taken seriously.

But the real kicker came at the bottom of the list. It simply said, "On Day 1, there will only be three rules." "If Rule #4 suddenly appears on your paper, DON'T FOLLOW IT."

I didn't know what to make of all this. I couldn't believe that a school would have such a twisted set of rules, let alone that they would be given to students on the first day of the new school year. But as I looked around the room, I knew that I wasn't the only one feeling scared and confused.

As I walked through the hallways of Millfield High, I couldn't help but feel a sense of dread. I had just received a list of rules that seemed more like a threat than a set of guidelines, and I had no idea what was in store for me.

But as I scanned the crowd of students, my eyes landed on a familiar face. It was my old friend, Emma. We hadn't seen each other since middle school, but the sight of her familiar face brought a sense of comfort to my otherwise anxious mind.

I made my way over to her, eager to catch up and see how she had been doing. But as I approached, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It was as if the air around her was thick with an unseen darkness, a creeping sense of dread that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.

I tried to push the feeling aside, reminding myself that it was just my imagination getting the better of me. But as I stood before her, I couldn't ignore the way her eyes seemed to look right through me, as if she were seeing something that I couldn't.

Her smile was forced, her laughter hollow, and I couldn't help but feel like I was in the presence of something sinister. It was as if she were hiding something, a secret that she was desperate to keep hidden.

But before I could ask her about it, the bell rang, signaling the start of the first period. Emma gave me a quick hug and told me to be careful before disappearing into the crowded hallway.

As I made my way to my first class, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about Emma. I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was something in her demeanor that seemed almost fearful.

I tried to push the thought out of my mind as I took my seat and waited for class to begin. But as the day went on, and the strange rules of Millfield High started to take hold, I couldn't help but wonder what was going on with my old friend.

Was she in trouble? Was she afraid of something? And more importantly, was there anything I could do to help her?
