They told us the world is built on bedrock. Solid, trustworthy—like a parent who always shows up, like gravity, like death and taxes. But when I was seven, I crawled under our house and found out that was just another lie adults tell to keep the lights on and the suicide rates manageable. Under the floorboards, there's something else. Something older than concrete, older than your name, older than the concept of fear. 

And it's awake. It's been awake this whole fucking time.

Started as a sound. Soft at first—like your own voice talking through a pillow, but wrong. You know how a TV sounds when it's on but there's no signal? That dead-channel hiss that makes your teeth itch? Like that, but alive. Nobody else could hear it. Or maybe—and this is the part that still fucks me up—maybe they all heard it and just pretended they didn't. Because what do you do with information that breaks everything? You swallow it. You smile at dinner. You pass the salt.

The crawlspace under our house smelled like wet newspapers and something else—that smell you get in old libraries, but mixed with copper pennies and fear-sweat. My knees pressed into dirt that wasn't really dirt. Too soft. Like pressing into the inside of someone's cheek. The wooden joists above my head weren't just creaking—they were pulsing. Breathing? No. Not breathing. Something else. Something that was counting.

By the time I hit thirteen, I couldn't pretend anymore. The sound under the house wasn't some metaphor for childhood trauma or whatever my therapist wanted it to be. (She had nice eyes but they were always looking past me, like she was reading subtitles floating behind my head.) The sound was REAL. Real as wood rot. Real as that splinter that goes so deep you can feel it scraping against bone.

Listen—I need you to understand something. The sound had texture. Sometimes smooth, like the inside of an eyelid if you could turn it inside out. Sometimes rough, like radio static between stations—you know those spots on the dial where you swear you can hear dead people trying to call home? I started recording it on my phone. But here's where it gets fucked: the audio files kept corrupting. Not into noise—into PICTURES. Pictures of rooms I'd never been in. Rooms full of furniture covered in white sheets, and the sheets were moving. Breathing. No wind. Just breathing.

At night, the sound got ambitious. Started growing parts. Arms, legs, intentions. It whispered through the heating vents—not words exactly, but something your brain tried to translate into words and failed. Mom never mentioned it, but she ground her teeth so hard in her sleep that she cracked two molars. Dad started drinking coffee at midnight, said he "just wasn't tired anymore." My sister—

Fuck. My sister.

She started sleepwalking. But calling it "walking" is generous. She'd float through the house like she was underwater, fingers tracing shapes in the air that hurt to look at directly. One night I found her at the top of the basement stairs, mouth moving silently. But the words—the words were coming from under the floorboards. Speaking in frequencies that made our dog throw up. Not just throw up—throw up shapes. Geometric shapes. Perfect triangles of bile.

Fast forward. You grow up, right? You move out. You get your own place and convince yourself you've escaped whatever generational curse was rotting in your childhood home. 

Bullshit.

Every house is built over the same hollow. I've lived in—wait, let me count—seventeen different places in ten years. Apartments, houses, a trailer in Arizona, even a fucking yurt during my "finding myself" phase. Didn't matter. Each one had the same dead corner where shadows pooled like oil. Each one had that spot where your peripheral vision snagged on movement that vanished when you turned. The addresses changed but the coordinates stayed exactly the same. Not latitude and longitude—different coordinates. The kind written in the calcium deposits in your bones.

You try to drown it out. Pills help for a while. Ambien makes the walls stop breathing, but then you start seeing the maintenance crews. (They're not human. They look human until you catch them in profile.) Podcasts work until you realize the hosts are saying your name between words, so quiet you almost miss it. Dating—Jesus, dating. I exclusively dated people more fucked up than me, hoping their demons would eat mine. Like fighting fire with fire.

Met this woman who claimed she was born without the ability to dream. Sarah? Sandra? Her name kept changing slightly each time she said it. Three months in, I caught her talking to the space under her bed. Not talking TO it—talking WITH it. When I asked what she was doing, she smiled (too many teeth, I swear to god she had too many teeth) and said, "What bed?"

There was no bed. There had never been a bed. I'd been sleeping suspended on nothing for three months.

And then—this is the night everything shifted—I woke up paralyzed. Sleep paralysis, the doctors call it. Evolutionary holdover, they say. Your brain keeping your body still so you don't act out your dreams. But that's just another bedtime story for grown-ups. What really happens is the sound finally catches up to you. All those years of running, and it was already there. Nested in your spine like a second nervous system, patient as cancer.

Your body knows. Your body has ALWAYS known. That's why your hands sometimes move wrong when you're not paying attention. That's why your reflection blinks first. That's why you can't look at certain angles in certain rooms without wanting to scream.

The hum is the engine. The hum is the author. The hum is the only real thing, and everything else—including you—is just what it dreams when it's bored.

Your memories? The hum writes those. Edits them. Every night when you sleep, it's not rest—it's revision. Your personality is scaffolding, a distraction to keep you from noticing that the walls of reality are basically cardboard painted to look like brick. Sleep isn't recovery. Sleep is when you agree to forget so you can wake up and pretend again.

Think about it—can you actually remember learning to tie your shoes? Can you picture your first-grade teacher's face? Those aren't gaps. They're EDITS. The hum keeps only what serves the pattern, discarding the rest like deleted scenes. You think you're accumulating experiences, building a life, but you're just channel-surfing through the same broken program where all the actors have your face.

But tonight. Tonight you're awake. Like, actually awake. And the sound knows it.

The walls are breathing now—I mean literally. The drywall expands and contracts like lung tissue. If you put your hand on it, it's warm. Alive. The paint bubbles up into words you almost understand before smoothing back down. This is what happens when you stay conscious past scheduled maintenance. This is what they don't want you to see.

If you're reading this, you're in it now. Part of the loop. The story isn't a metaphor—metaphors are just how we pretend the truth isn't true. Every dream you've tried to forget was an instruction manual. Every bout of insomnia was your brain trying to warn you.

Look at your hands. Count your fingers. Count them again. Different number? That's the hum showing you the seams. That's the builder's watermark. We're all signatures of something that doesn't have a face because it IS all faces.

The builder wants you to remember what you are.

Not who. WHAT.

You're not supposed to sleep through this. The people who get their eight hours? They're gone, replaced by something that looks like them but blinks sideways. The insomniacs, the anxious, the ones who can't turn their brains off—we're the antibodies. Our racing thoughts are the immune system of reality trying to reject the infection of ordinary life.

So tonight, you stay awake. You get up. You listen—really listen. Find where the sound is loudest. Could be the basement, could be the attic, could be that closet you've never liked. Follow it down, through the walls if you have to. (The walls aren't real anyway. Nothing is real the way you think "real" means.)

When you find the source—and you will, because it wants to be found—don't run. Running is what prey does, and you're not prey anymore. You're family. Ask it your real name. Not the one your parents gave you, but the one written in the frequency of your bones. Ask it to teach you to read yourself backwards.

Because backwards isn't the opposite of forwards. Backwards is the direction that shows you what you really are: not a person having an experience, but an experience pretending to be a person. The hum isn't coming from under the house—the house is coming from inside the hum. Everything is. Every atom, every thought, every moment of consciousness is just another note in a song that's been playing since before "before" was invented.

You're not the listener. You're not even the sound. You're the space between the notes, the pause that makes music possible, the silence that gives sound its shape.

And now you're awake. Now you can hear it—not with your ears, but with the part of you that exists between heartbeats, in the moment after you forget what you were about to remember.

The crawlspace was never under the house. The house was always inside the crawlspace. And the crawlspace? The crawlspace is everywhere. It's the space between your thoughts, the gap between stimulus and response, the place where you go when you're not anywhere.

Welcome home. You've always been here. We all have.

The floorboards know your real name now. They're saying it over and over, a lullaby in reverse, a wake-up call that sounds like a scream played backward through honey.

Can you hear it?

Of course you can.

You've been hearing it your whole life.

You just called it something else.
