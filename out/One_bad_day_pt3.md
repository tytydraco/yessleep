To start this off sorry for the delay, first I’ll clear some things up.
So for those who asked yes Beezle knows I’m posting these, I believe his words were 

“Aye who’d believe you anyways”

And by some of your questions/replies I’d say he was right, oh and yea some of you smarter individuals figured out who he was or at least faster then I did, I will say in my defense I didn’t know all the names just the few everyone does, but let’s not say to much more about it don’t want to spoil the surprise for those who didn’t know.

To continue we’re we left off; so honestly never figured much out about the girl, her and b wanted to “talk alone” so I walked to the car and just sat and waited, I know a hell of a first adventure huh? 

Probably should’ve started off with a better story but we’ll hindsight’s 20/20 as they say.

The next “case” was somewhere in north Florida around some old town called st Augustine

B said and I quote “had a good feeling” just wish he didn’t always talk so cryptic but well i guess it made sense at the time, didn’t really know me but I could say the same for him

Either way pulling up to one of the many old brick and moss covered buildings we “let ourselves in” as b said more like broke the door down, I think this was my first time realizing his strength is way above human 

I mean when he hit the door it shook the whole building sending the door flying into the back wall 

Walking in we see a shadow pass by the top of the old wooden stairs to our right, at this point b just took off running up the stairs with me quickly following behind

turning the corner I see b holding a finger to his lips telling me to be quiet, as I slightly follow behind he turns winks and punches his hand through the wall grabbing the shadow figure by the throat and pulling them through the wall 

“So, y’all are the one creating this energy field”-b

“Y’all?” I say when about 15 more come pouncing out the shadows towards us

“B!” I yell admittedly a little fearful
“What the fuck do we do against shadows?” 

“Show them the light” b says with a wink pulling out a dagger from his coat that shined brighter then any metal I’ve ever seen

Stabbing the shadow in the head b then tosses me a dagger as we go back to back

A little panicked I start swinging wildly cutting a few down, while b having way to much fun grabs one slinging it into 3 others, then proceeded to cut them down with grace

The fight was over almost as soon as it began 

“A little easy wouldn’t you say?”

Just then a huge one comes bursting through the wall charging at me and slinging me into the back wall

“Aye, I think you spoke to soon wanker” b says in a god awful Australian accent smirking like usual

With the breath knocked out of me the only words I could muster was “you think?” Wheezingly 

While b laughs the thing starts charging b grabbing him and laying into his chest with a fury of punches 

Catching my breath I scream “Beezle!”

Before I notice him laughing as he uses the dagger to cut the arm holding him off

Beezle now in a torn suit seeming genially annoyed said “do you know how hard it is to find a good suit now of days” grabbing a pair of brass knuckles from his pant pockets with a similar light as the blades he rushes the huge figure pouncing on top of him beating his head in

I’m sure if it was human would’ve been a gruesome sight, but the shadow dissipated into some type of smoke

A now calmer Beezle got up and snapped his fingers, with a new suit appearing on him

Which would normally shock me but well it’s been one strange week, leaving a now almost destroyed building beezle just looks at me and says “you feeling tacos?” Nodding we walked to the car well I limped and drove off.

Again sorry I can’t post more right now but ill let y’all know of some more of our adventures soon, oh before I forget Beezle said “bye” too.
