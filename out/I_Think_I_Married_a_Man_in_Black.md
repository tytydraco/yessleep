I’ve lived in New Mexico most of my life. Not Roswell. *Definitely* not Roswell. Hell, I’ve never even stepped foot over the Chaves county line. The strangest place I’ve ever been is a Denny’s at 3 AM and the craziest thing I’ve ever done is donuts in the parking lot of said Denny’s. I don’t go looking for trouble. I don’t go hiking up into the Superstition Mountains or go around whistling all up and down my street at night. Like my mama always told me, I keep my head on my shoulders and my nose in my own. 

All this to say, my life is normal. That’s what I keep telling myself, repeating it like a mantra or a magic spell that will make all of this suddenly make clear and perfect sense. 

I’m getting ahead of myself. The best and really the only place to start is when I met Kurt. 

Before Kurt was Kurt, he was Kailey. We met at the first gay bar I’d ever been to—  talk about a hole in one. I’d lived a sheltered life, which was why it was a shell-shock when I moved to Seattle, riding on several academic scholarships to attend the University of Washington. I went from desert sunsets and dust storms to seventy inches of rain a year and the brand new mystery that was *snow.* 

In a capital city with no friends, I’d never felt lonelier. I didn’t have a roommate. I got the coveted single dorm, something I didn’t even want. But I was too nervous to ask for a reassignment.

“Tell me all about the new friends you’ve made!” My sister asked on our nightly phone call. I’d been there a week, and I’d barely spoken to anyone my age. 

“I… I haven’t met anyone, really. Martina, this place is huge. Everyone is so different from the people back home. You know how hard it is for me to connect with people.”

Martina scoffed like she’d discovered I’d filched a little of the weed she kept in a hollowed out book on her shelf. She didn’t know I knew it was there, until I started hanging it over her head in exchange for chocolate. 

“Alright, changuita. You have to make at least *one* friend by the start of next month. I’ll help you put yourself out there, but that’s an order.”

I sighed, because I knew there was no arguing with my older sister. 

“Aye, aye, Captain,” I said, saluting even though she couldn’t see. 

“Love you, changuita. You’re going to be the talk of the town, just you wait.”

“Love you too, pececita. They’re going to be talking about what an idiot I am.”

Martina gave me a kiss through the phone.

“Doubt it. You’re going to light up the sky.”

That weekend, Martina suggested I go out and get a taste of the night life. She said the gay bar scene in Seattle was one of the best in the country. She was one of the few people in my family other than my mama who accepted me. 

So one cold and rainy September night, I ventured downtown into some neon-and-rainbow flavored building. I hoped this would be over quick and I could get back to my books and my bed. I ordered a drink and sat at the corner of the bar, nursing it so I could at least say I’d been there long enough. That was when I saw Kailey for the first time. I was a wallflower, but she was on the dance floor all alone, and tearing it up like no one was watching her. She tossed her long blonde hair back and moved her hips in a way that mesmerized me.

Before I knew what was happening, my feet were underneath me and I had walked over to her. 

“You have pretty teeth. Wanna dance with me?”

Those were the first words Kailey ever said to me, and of course, I did. I lost myself in her pale green eyes and the curiosity in them as the music playing above told us to raise up our rabbit hearts. I didn’t leave the bar until close, and my bed that night was the un-loneliest it had been since I came to Washington.

Kailey was everything that I wasn’t, boisterous and outgoing with a wicked sense of humor. She was technicolor. I was hopelessly in love before even a week had passed. Something about us just wordlessly clicked. 

There were plenty of words, though. She was something of a poet, even if she seemed to get mixed up just a little sometimes.

“The sky is… they is… the stars are at home in you. You are Ciela. You are my sky.”

She’d told me that on our month anniversary, sitting on the roof of my dorm and watching the stars. The power had conveniently gone out just in time for the meteor shower they’d predicted that night. 

I watched her for a moment, noticing the strange and beautiful glint in her green eyes. She made me feel like I had my very own manic pixie dream girl. 

“I love you too. My sky is brighter with you in it.”

She laughed and I kissed her. Then we snuck down to go get late night pizza, missing the rest of the meteors. But I didn’t care.

I made another friend by my sister’s deadline. And then another. And another. Kailey got me to open myself up to others, and she seemed to have a natural gift at making friends. By the time I graduated, I had enough friends to have a pool party to celebrate. I can still remember the way the lights underneath the water cast a blue glow on Kailey’s full, freckled face. 

That night was when the nightmares began. I’d had weird dreams all my life, but very few that could be considered that bad. It started with me waking up, a feeling so vivid I hadn’t realized I was still asleep. My skin was slick with sweat, and my mouth felt chalky. Kailey was in a dead sleep beside me, barely moving.

The stale air in our bedroom sweltered, like it was on the surface of the sun. Just outside the window, on the fire escape, I knew the sweet chill of a northern night waited for me. 

I walked across the room, which seemed to take entirely too long, then climbed out. I stood there for two seconds before the entire world turned upside down. I only just grabbed the edge of the fire escape, narrowly avoiding falling down into the endless void beneath me.

When I was a little kid, sometimes I would lay flat on the ground and look up at the sky. I’d imagine falling headlong into it, hurtling up forever, until I got dizzy. It’s one of those things kids seem to collectively do without communicating much about it, just like imagining something running alongside the car on road trips.

Now, it was my reality. My nails began to crack as I clutched tight onto the metal grate. My window looked light years away, and when I shouted for Kailey, there was no answer. 

The sky beneath me was unearthly, purple and black, rippling and churning with foreign energy. The stench of ozone overwhelmed me, and I began to lose my grip. 

They say in space, no one can hear you scream, but I could definitely hear whatever was doing it in the sky below me. It sounded as if an animal was being gutted alive. My grip slid for the last time, and I plummeted down, the screams melding into my own as a bright, white light consumed me. 

I woke up and burst into sobs. The panic flooding through me sent me tumbling out of bed and onto the floor, running to the bathroom before Kailey had even woken up. 

The next thing I remember is sitting with her in the cramped space between her toilet and bathtub, staring into her big green eyes with a sick taste in my mouth.

“Bad dreams can’t hurt you,” she told me, “they’re not real. They’re like thunderclouds; so big and scary, but you can’t even stand on them. They’re made out of nothing.”

In her own special way, she’d made everything feel better. But that didn’t stop the nightmare from coming back. It came back so frequently that I almost expected it. Eventually, I remembered less and less of it, only waking up in a cold sweat and knowing that *something* bad had happened in my sleep. That was until we moved back to New Mexico. 

I couldn’t stand the rain or missing my family a second longer, so I found a place not far away from my hometown. It was close enough to make regular visits to my mother and sister, but far enough to keep my distance from the relatives I preferred not to be around. To my utter delight, Kailey agreed to move back with me. She said she’d never been, but always wanted to. 

We got an apartment together and I got my dream job at a climate research firm. Life was looking up more than it ever had. 

Things change, though. Flowers bloom, baby birds leave their nests, and we become ourselves more and more each day. We’d only been living together for three months when I came home and found Kailey sobbing on our couch. My mama had always told me that the first three months living together is crucial for a relationship; it tells you (more or less) if you’re going to be able to stand each other for the rest of your lives. 

My heart sank, and even though things had been going so well, I thought it was the end. But instead of a waterlogged breakup, Kailey sat up and looked me in the eyes.

“I’m not a woman, Ciela.”

I stared at her for a moment, confused. Then I let out a nervous laugh.

“You’re… you’re not? What are you? An alien?”

Kailey looked hurt, and I backpedaled.

“God, I’m sorry. That was mean. Tell me what you mean, mi vida.”

She bit her lip and looked away. It was the saddest I’d ever seen her.

“I’m a man, Ciela. I am! It’s what I’ve always been. I can’t pretend to be something I’m not anymore.”

I may not have been the most brilliant person, but I wasn’t stupid. His confession fit into place in my brain after only a moment. 

I pulled him into a tight hug, and I knew this was probably the most important one I’d ever give in my life. 

“Oh. *Oh.* Do you mean that you’re transgender?”

I felt him nod where his head was buried into my shoulder. 

“Do you still love me?”

The fact that he felt the need to ask that question broke my heart. There was no doubt. I’d only ever been with girls, and my feelings on men were complicated, but I loved him for *him*, no matter how he identified. 

“Of course! Of course I still love you…Kailey? Can I still call you that?”

“Yes. But I want to find a new name.”

I ran my fingers through his blond tangles and wiped his tears.

“Don’t you worry. We’ll find you a new name.”

I was terrified that I’d do or say something wrong from lack of knowledge; I already had once. But I was excited to be there for him on his journey. If he wasn’t afraid to grow and change to be happy, then I would put on a brave face to do the same. 

We struggled with a name for a while. He would go through periods of trial that always ended in unsatisfaction and sometimes tears. Then one day I came home from work, and he was wearing one of those dollar store name tag stickers that said HELLO, MY NAME IS \[blank\].In small block letters, he’d written “Kurt.” Naturally, I rolled with it. He’d been listening to Nirvana a lot lately, so I wasn’t all that surprised by the new choice. 

“Hey, Kurt. What’s for dinner?”

I watched his face light up, and somehow I knew that this was the one that would stick. Just like that night we met, something clicked. 

“Pizza?”

He phrased it as a question, and when pizza was the question, the answer was always yes. 

I had him call in an order for carry out, and I’ll never forget the look on his face when he went up to the counter and used his new name to pick up our dinner. The cashier still called him ma’am, but the misgendering seemed to bounce right off him. I was a little angry, but I tamped it down and drove home with him and our victory dinner.

Over the next two years, I was with Kurt every step of the way in his journey. Binders, hormones, and a few different gender therapists—  I helped him through it all. As he got further into his transition, I got further into my career. I was coming home later and later in the evenings, but the benefits were showing more than enough in my wallet. And whatever hour I came in the door at, I knew there was always a warm bed with Kurt in it to crawl into. 

I’d known for a long time that Kurt was the man I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, but he deserved something special. Getting down on one knee and pulling out some gaudy ring never felt right, so I had something far better in mind. 

Kurt had been putting away a little slice of his paycheck every two weeks not long after he came out to me. He was saving up for a sex change once he’d been on hormone replacement therapy for long enough, and he’d made it clear he didn’t want me to have to pay for it. Secretly, though, I’d matched every penny he’d saved two times over, as well as doing research and getting quotes from doctors near us who specialized in that kind of surgery. 

When everything was in order, I took him out to our favorite Mexican restaurant. Then, before dessert came, I took his hand in mine and started my little speech.

“You know I love you, right?” 

He gave me a small smile and squeezed my hand. It was strong. He made me feel safe.

“Of course I do, my sky.”

Before I could give myself any time to be afraid, I took out the piece of paper and smoothed it on the table in front of us. It showed the money I had saved up to help with the final stage of his transition; I’d even circled it with his favorite red pen.

“I love you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. But if you’ll marry me, I want you to be able to do it in a body you can love just as much as you love me.”

Kurt picked up the piece of paper and stared at it. Whether you’re getting a yes or no from the other person, there’s usually a predictable response when you ask someone to marry you. There’s an explosion of emotions, shouting and a happy dance, or even a quiet ‘no.’ I didn't get any of those from Kurt, not at first. 

His face went completely blank. I could’ve chalked up to shock, or maybe even panic. Both are normal reactions to a proposal when you’re not expecting it, even if you love that person. But this… felt different. There was something that was just *wrong* about his initial reaction, something I couldn’t put my finger on. It looked like staring into the face of a mannequin. 

It was then that I noticed his lips moving ever so slightly. He was whispering to himself, his voice barely above a breath. I couldn’t make out what he was saying, and I squeezed his hand hard. It felt like ice in mine.

“Kurt?”

He looked up at me and gasped as if he was surfacing from underneath ice. Then his eyes welled up and he covered his mouth.

“Yes! Yes, I’ll marry you!”

When he wrapped his arms around me, what happened before didn’t seem to matter. I made a mental note to maybe take him to the doctor about it, then gradually forgot. 

The surgeries went off without a hitch, with Kurt getting the second as soon as he’d recovered fully from the first. Work was thankfully more than understanding about me having to switch to remote for the time it took for him to heal. That kind of empathy from a job was rare. 

Once Kurt was well enough to move on his own again after the second surgery, he began to go on long walks. I hadn’t minded it at the time, but sometimes he would be gone for long enough to make me nervous. Then one night, he didn’t come home. He’d set out just after lunch, and by 9 PM I was sitting by the front door and wondering if I should call the police. A thousand horrible things that could’ve happened to him were running through my head. 

Just as I snatched up my car keys to go and look for him a third time, an intense ringing filled my ears, making my eyes burn and my head spin. I had been prone to migraines as a teenager, but this was something else. I collapsed to the floor, and my vision went blurry and dark. The last thing I heard was the door opening. 

I could smell the freshly washed sheets before my eyes opened. Someone slid into bed with me, wrapping their arms around my middle. 

“Kurt, is that you?”

I craned my neck enough to see that yes, it was him. His eyes looked… strange, and he had a wide smile. If I hadn’t known him as well as I did, I would’ve thought he was strung out on something.

“Yes, C. I found you asleep in the kitchen. Are you feeling alright?”

I rubbed my temple and nodded. I still had a bit of a headache, but I knew it would go away with a good night’s rest. 

“Yeah, I was just waiting for you. Where did you go? I’ve been worried sick, mi vida.”

There was a long pause, long enough that I thought he might’ve already gone to sleep.

“I was talking with my parents.”

Kurt never told me much about his parents, even when we first started dating. All he would say when I brought it up was “they don’t accept me.” I knew how that felt, so after that, I didn’t ask. 

“How… how did that go?”

Kurt stared at me for a good five seconds, like I’d asked him a math equation. But then he smiled, kissed my forehead, and closed his eyes. I took that as a good sign, and followed him off to Dreamland. 

After almost two years of wedding planning and physical therapy, we set the date for the middle of July. The temperatures were record, and the makeup my older sister put on me felt like it was going to melt off. But even though we were all baking, I couldn’t have been happier. Everything was perfect. I’d even found my dream dress, and Kurt told me how beautiful I looked when my mother walked me down the aisle. 

When I pulled out my notecards, I told Kurt just how much he meant to me. I let him know that I was all-in, and that I would love him no matter who he was, what he did, or where he went. I tried my best not to cry as I told him that he may call me his sky, but to me, he was my whole universe. 

When he pulled out his notecards, two of his teeth fell out and blood began to gush from his nose.

I yelped and everyone in our wedding party gasped. The next few minutes were a bit of a blur; all I could remember was Kurt insisting he was fine to keep going with blood-soaked tissue stuffed in both nostrils. 

So the show went on. In a nasal voice, Kurt told me that I showed him what life was all about, and that he’d be nowhere without me. He told me that I had given him the courage he needed to be himself. Our first kiss as husband and wife tasted like iron—  but I didn’t mind.

The rest of the wedding went off without a hitch, and we slept into the afternoon of the next day. When I woke and groggily rubbed the grit out of my eyes, I noticed Kurt was carefully folding clothes into my suitcase.

“What’re you doing?”He looked up at me like he’d just been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. Then he grinned, bright and wide.  

“Honeymoon,” was all the answer he gave me. I thought we weren’t going to be able to afford one, but it seemed he had a monetary surprise of his own.

I spent most of the flight to Paris that night in and out of sleep. Kurt wanted the window seat, and I leaned on his shoulder and dozed a nasty crick into my neck. Only one memory sticks out solidly in my mind from that nineteen hour black hole. I was suddenly lucid around three in the morning, and Kurt was staring out the window, giggling to himself. 

It wasn’t creepy or tired. It was genuinely one of the most happy sounds I’d ever heard him make—  the kind of joy most people save for the altar or the delivery room. Something out the window had him elated.

I peeked over his shoulder and saw ribbons of green and purple light dancing across the sky, small but easily visible on the horizon. 

“What’s that?” I mumbled.

Kurt turned his eyes back to look at me for only a moment. Then they glued back onto the light display out the window.Something… wasn’t right about it. It didn’t so much flicker as… move. The smell of iron filled my nose and stuck to the roof of my mouth as I watched the lights writhe. 

“Aurora borealis.”

I nodded and buried my face back into his shoulder. The next memory I have was landing at Charles-de-Gaulle Airport. Only when we were walking through the terminal did I realize that most of our flight had been in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and none of it was far enough up to see the Northern Lights. I’d always been pretty good at telling when I was dreaming, and I knew that I hadn’t been. But I chalked it up to one of those weird things that happens sometimes, like deja vu or seeing shadows out of the corner of your eye. Either way, it was a “mind my own” situation in my book. And Kurt having anything to do with it was the last thought in my mind. He was fascinated with the sky, and there was nothing deeper to be found in it.

The honeymoon was wonderfully uneventful. I got my kiss under the Eiffel Tower, and I got to taste a genuine baguette for the very first time. My new husband spent every second making sure I knew how much I was loved. By the time we were back on the plane to the US, I was exhausted. But it was the good kind.

Kurt and I settled into domestic bliss, and everything seemed perfect. I allowed myself to fall into the notion that we’d left all the strange occurrences behind us. In reality, it was just the eye of the hurricane. But it was nice while it lasted.

There were no real warning signs when it all began to go downhill. Kurt had always been a little odd, but it was one of the things I loved about him. It was an ordinary Saturday night, one we had spent drinking wine and watching shitty sci-fi b-flicks before doing some newlywed snuggling and going to bed. 

My eyes opened at some odd hour of the night. I wish I could adequately describe what a terrifying sight it is to wake up unable to see anything but another person’s eyes, even when that person is the love of your life. Kurt’s face was so close to mine that our noses were parallel. 

“Ciela. I need a suit.”

I looked over and saw that he was standing just beside my side of the bed, body bent at an uncomfortable angle to be quite literally face-to-face with me. I put a hand on each shoulder and gently pushed him away from me. 

“What? Kurt, what time is it?”

“I need a suit.” 

He wore a thousand yard stare, like he was looking right through me. I shook him a bit, but got no response other than “I need a suit.”

Groggy and confused, I tried to go back to sleep. Every time I would drift, his single phrase would come again and wake me up. After an hour, I was wide awake. I checked the closet for his wedding tuxedo, and found it missing. 

I thought it must be a mental break. I tried to call for an ambulance more than once, but every time I would get close to dialing those three little numbers, a note of fear would fold into Kurt’s blank expression, and I’d hesitate. 

*I need a suit.*

*I need a suit.*

*I need a suit.*

By the time my alarm went off, I was scouring for menswear stores with bleary eyes. As soon as the closet one opened, I climbed into the car with Kurt in tow and sped away. I thought that maybe if I indulged him, he would be okay.

I sat on the floor by the entrance and dipped in and out of sleep as Kurt browsed around like this was a normal shopping trip. He found a suit he liked almost immediately, a deep black. I swiped my credit card, and he wore the suit out. 

It was like someone flipped a switch, and he was back to normal. 

“You look tired. Let me drive and we’ll get you home so you can rest.”

He let me lean on him and didn’t complain when I cried exhausted tears into his brand new suit jacket. When we returned home, I slept into the early evening, Kurt by my side the whole time. He’d called my work and let them know that I was sick and wouldn’t make it in that day. 

We didn’t talk about it much, and save for the suits that he always seemed to be wearing, it soon began to feel like a strange, vivid dream I’d had. I brought it up only once, he apologized, and we laughed about it. 

That sick day would prove to be the last decent day off I would have for a while. A new kind of disease was affecting crops in the Midwest and we were working around the clock trying to know our enemy. Any time I had off was spent eating, sleeping, and catching up on one or two chores at a time until my energy ran out. 

I wasn’t entirely sure what Kurt did for work, something remote in IT, but he took care of most everything that needed to be done at the house while I was on-the-clock. He was my lifesaver during those grueling months, always providing a warm meal and warm body to come home to. 

When it all seemed like it couldn’t get any worse, I came home at half past midnight to a trail of rose petals leading from the front door of the little house we rented, across the foyer, and up the stairs. My heart instantly melted as the tension left my body. 

I followed the trail up to the master bathroom, drawn in by floral smells, the faint light of flickering candles, and Kurt’s soft voice humming a wordless tune. A wanting warmth was building in the pit of my stomach. 

“Kurt?”

Steam rose in thick curls from the hot bath he was sitting in, but that heat was nothing compared to the one in his eyes. 

“Oh, my hardworking wife.”

“You devil. You’re even wearing that hat I like.”

Kurt tilted the brim of the fedora down like he was the hardboiled detective in a gritty noir movie, then silently beckoned me closer. 

I closed the distance to the bathtub, shedding my clothes as I went. The prospect of getting clean alone was tantalizing enough, considering how I’d spent the last 18 hours slaving over a petri dish and a notepad, but scratching that weeks-long itch for my husband at the same time took the cake. 

As I sank down into the water, something… felt strange. I took a closer look at the bath water, noticing it had a peachy tone to it.

“You used my favorite bubble bath too?”

A look of confusion came over his face before he shook his head. When he did so, the candlelight fell on his skin wrong. It reflected it like plastic.

I reached out and touched his face, and my hand came away sticky. Clumps of wet, pink flesh covered my hand, and I realized with horror that it wasn’t just the candlelight washing him out. He’d turned almost white. The fear must’ve been evident on my face; I’m sure my jaw dropped.

“Is something wrong, love?”

As he spoke, I noticed the inside of his mouth was clogged with thick strings of slimy red and his tongue was the color of dead fish. That was when I screamed.

I practically had to force Kurt to go to the ER. He couldn’t understand why I was freaking out. He blamed his dripping skin on a goddamned sunburn; he said he’d been out tending to the yard for too long yesterday. Naturally, I didn’t believe him, but I didn’t call him on it.

“I’ve never seen anything quite like this.”

We’d spent four hours at the ER as doctors ran all sorts of tests, and predictably, no one had any answers. 

“And you’re sure you haven’t been exposed to any kind of corrosive materials?”

Kurt nodded, and the doctor looked at his chart again, before he asked me to step out of the room.

“I’ll be honest with you Mrs. Allen. I’ve been doing this for thirty years, and I’m at a loss for what exactly is wrong with your husband. I’ve never seen ‘melting skin’ as a symptom before. My best advice is to manage his pain if he develops any, and get him in to see a dermatologist ASAP. I can refer you to the best one I know.”

I told him thank you, and that would be great, because what else could I have done? Back then, I was fearing cancer or some type of allergy to his own skin that would leave him wrapped in bandages for the rest of his life—  how naïve I was. 

After eight hours moving from cramped white room to cramped white room, Kurt and I headed home. His skin had stopped melting, but it was now a ghostly grey-white. The drive home was a silent spiral of all the things that could be wrong with him and what I would do if I had to plan a funeral for my own husband because his body ate him alive. 

By the time we made it into the driveway, tears were rolling down my face over terrible things that hadn’t even happened yet. Kurt reached over and gently grabbed my hand.

“Ciela, do you love me?”

I turned to him, effectively distracted from my anxiety by such a foolish question. I wiped my eyes and gripped his hand back.

“Are you kidding me? Of course I love you.”

He reached out with knuckles that seemed just a little too bony and stroked my cheek. His milky skin seemed to shine in the light of the morning sun, his eyes just a little too wide but full of adoration and those green irises I’d fallen head over heels for. 

“I love you too. You complete me.”

All the sadness, worry, and fatigue in my body seemed to melt away when he looked at me that way—  when he said things like that. Those feelings were replaced by that same yearning I’d felt before the night and our bath had gone awry. With the enthusiasm of our college days, we fell into the backseat. 

Kurt was all too happy to again show me just how the equipment worked. I didn’t linger too long on how all of his scar tissue had disappeared, and how everything felt like it had *always* been there more so than before. I just let it make me happy, because I knew it made him happy, and enjoyed the show.

Work calmed down a little after that. Not entirely, but enough that I could be home for dinner and relax with my husband before heading to get a full six hours. Still, I wasn’t around much. The brief return of normalcy was just that—  brief.

That summer was thick and heavy, and a monsoon had rolled in that soaked every inch of the desert around us, rolling in little rivers down the gutters of our suburban street. It all reminded me how much I didn’t miss the rain up North.

The house was empty and our umbrella was missing, so I assumed Kurt had gone out on one of his walks. Exhausted, I sat down on the couch, kicked off my shoes, and turned on the TV. I never really watched the news, but someone had to have left it on the local channel.

*In other news tonight, school is out for the summer, but police are looking for a break-in suspect who didn’t get the memo that science class was over.*

A knot of dread tightened in my stomach. My body tensed with the electric sensation of ‘something is coming,’ the same feeling you get before the drop on a roller coaster. 

*Late last night, officers responded to a call for a break-in at Chavez Memorial High School. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the suspect entered through a broken window. No valuables were taken, but a look at the science lab revealed the only thing the thief had taken: the school’s supply of—  making HIM tonight’s big loser!*

Setting the remote back down, I took a deep breath and sank into the couch, inexplicably relieved. I watched middle-aged men act like teenagers for long enough to calm my nerves before channel-surfing. At some point, I heard Kurt humming and knocking around in the kitchen. I figured he must have come in the back door at some point, not wanting to track mud in the house. 

“Dinner’s almost ready, honey,” he called, and only then did I realize how starved I was. 

The smell didn’t hit me until I was already through the doorway. I tried to convince myself that he must’ve just picked up a new, odd-smelling dish at one of the international markets for us to try; he had been on an adventurous food kick lately. But all the convincing in the world was useless when he walked over and sat a shriveled, grey pig in front of me. Formaldehyde pooled on the plate, and I grappled with the fact that I now knew how that news anchor’s sentence ended. 

“You should eat, my sky. You need your strength.”

And do you want to know the worst part? As I stared into the closed eyes of the wrinkled lump of baby pork, I almost did. Something foreign and primal in me wanted to pick it up and start with the head, to feel the weak bones crack between my teeth.

“Kurt… what did you do?”

He looked puzzled.

“I got us dinner, like always.”

I pushed the plate away and felt bile rise in my throat. The smell was beginning to make my eyes water. Kurt frowned and picked up his own, sinking teeth that looked just a little longer today into its soft stomach with a *squelch*. I turned and was sick on the floor. Alarmed, Kurt helped me to the bathroom and held my hair as the vomiting continued, until all I could do was heave and gag.

“Hm. I thought this might happen. I’m going to order your favorite takeout.”

Kurt finished his grisly meal alone as I showered. Afterward, we negotiated over my kung pao chicken. The sushi he couldn’t get enough of lately was not satisfying whatever strange craving he had anymore, so as long as he agreed not to bring any more carcasses into the house, I would buy him whatever raw cuts suited him at the butcher’s. To call it unsettling would be putting it mildly, but I could manage for him. 

That night, as I laid in bed, I watched as Kurt stared at himself in the mirror while he thought I slept. That was something he’d done ever since we met. It was a beautiful thing to watch him get more confident with himself during his frequent mirror sessions. 

Tonight was the widest I’d ever seen him smile, though. He’d stripped down, and I could see the tight outline of his ribs in the blue glow from the TV. He’d grown a few inches taller without me noticing, but it wasn’t a normal gain. It was like someone had stretched him out like putty, thinning out his limbs. His ears and nose looked smaller, his eyes taking up more space than they had before. 

Kurt was becoming something else, and I’ll admit, it frightened me more than a little. But in every change, I still loved him all the same. When he eventually came to bed, I wrapped my arms around him and nestled my face into the crook of his lily-white neck. 

A week passed before things reached the point of no return. 

Kurt and I were sitting down to dinner, he with a bowl of ground chicken I’d tossed with some spices, and me with lasagna for one. Meat juice dribbled down his chin, staining one of the black suits he never seemed to run out of. 

“Kurt, what’s happening to you?” I asked after finishing my last mouthful.

He didn’t answer, but he didn’t need to. The smile over his bowl told me I’d know soon enough.

I’d like to say that there was some kind of warning sign, that I woke up out of a dead sleep to the sounds of eerie whirring or a bright light through our bedroom window, but it didn’t go down like in the movies. One minute I was cozy in bed, falling asleep next to Kurt, and the next I was squinting into fluorescent lights, completely nude and strapped to a strange table.

I struggled, but it was no use. The metal bands held fast against my wrists and ankles. A door opened with a soft whoosh just out of my line of sight, and I struggled harder. An awful odor filled my nostrils, one it took me a second to recall: ozone.

The sight of beings that approached me on either side was something that leaves me shuddering even as I type this. The two of them leaned over me, vague and misty outlines of humanoid shapes. They were silver smudges with a stroke of black in the middle, and I yelped as one of them prodded a thin metal rod into my stomach. 

I shut my eyes tight as they continued to examine me, terrified of how this might end. My savior came in the form of another whoosh, another being that appeared as little more than a thumbprint on reality. And yet, somehow, the shape of this one was familiar. Not only that, but it was *furious.* It spoke in a language that I didn’t know and wasn’t sure even existed on our planet, and yet I understood every word.

“What the hell is happening here?! For fuck’s sake, you were supposed to talk to her! Not pin her down and poke her like a bug! We can’t do this kind of stuff to people anymore!“

The pair chattered out excuses, but the newcomer wouldn’t hear it. He moved over to me in the strange way these aliens did, laying a gentle hand on my stomach. That was when I recognized the third figure for who he was.

Kurt draped a blanket over my shivering body and stroked back my hair. I was the furthest thing from tired, my body rigid with terror and adrenaline, and yet my vision began fading to black anyway. 

I didn’t wake up back in bed, or in a forest in the middle of nowhere a week later. No, it was worse than that—  I woke up at work. My eyes swam back into focus on a petri dish full of a sample of black mold we’d been studying. 

It reminded me of the black smudges on the beings in the white room, and it hit me like a freight train. They were suits. 

I fell out of my chair and began to scream. My coworkers rushed over as I backed myself into a corner. My head was pounding, and blood trickled out of both nostrils. I think I might’ve projectile vomited on my boss. 

By the time the ambulance arrived, I’d somewhat composed myself. I told the paramedics I was fine, but both they and my boss insisted I go to the hospital. 

The ride was awkward, but thankfully not long. The paramedics kept me comfortable. Once we made it to the ER, I was brought to a waiting room just like the one Kurt and I had been in what felt like years ago, but was maybe a month at most. 

I wasn’t an idiot. I’d watched the movie and I’d seen one or another of those cheesy documentaries—  they’re all the same. But this… this was something else. Kurt wasn’t some secret government agent.

The nurse came in before I could panic any further, and I put on a brave face so they would just send me home and not draw this out any longer than necessary. 

She was a sweet older lady, and she helped me wash the mess of blood crusted onto my face before giving me a tiny cup full of water. 

“Mrs. Allen, can you tell me about the symptoms you’re having?”

“This really isn’t that big of a deal, you know. I’m fine, I’ve been a little nauseous lately; I think it was food poisoning or something.”

She asked me a few personal questions, then explained that they were going to do a blood test, then an x-ray of my stomach. 

“It’s just a precaution,” she said, “just to make sure the nasal bleeding and vomiting aren’t symptoms of a more serious issue.”

My blood was drawn, and I waited. The longer it took, the more my unease built. Eventually, a man in a white lab coat, similar to mine but cleaner, stepped into the room, with a warm smile on his face. It was not the same doctor as before, and if it had been, I don’t think he would’ve been as chipper.

“Let me be the first to tell you congratulations, Mrs. Allen. We didn’t find anything abnormal in your blood test, but it did tell us that you are, in fact, pregnant. That would explain the nausea and vomiting.”

I stared at him, only able to blink in bewilderment. His smile got a little wider, as if he was trying to coax me into one too.

“That’s not possible.”

A look of mild confusion came over his face, and he flipped through the papers on his clipboard.

“No history of fertility issues, and you said you’re sexually active, correct?”

I shook my head in disbelief.

“Yes. I am. With my *transgender* husband.”
