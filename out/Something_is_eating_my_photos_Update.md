Well... you all asked for an update, so here it is!

I tried to communicate with the creature... I used a picture of myself to lure it out using a picture of myself attached to a letter.

The letter I wrote read: Who are you? What is it you want from me?

And to my surprise... The creature actually responded to me, well after eating the photo of course?

It left me a letter in the kitchen as a sort of response, however unlike last time, it wasn't written in black ink or anything like that. It looked more like dried blood... Like the blood off of its chest from the heart carved into it perhaps? However, the definite answer of where this blood came from well... your guess is as good as mine.

Okay, here's what the letter said:

*My darling... my dear I've been waiting for you to reach out to me...*

*What I am... is irrelevant... However, I'm not what you'd call a 'human being'... but I love you more than any human ever could...*

*What I ask for is one simple request... YOU.*

*Why do I want you so badly? I honestly don't know... ever since you moved into this property... your very existence piqued my interest... I WANTED YOU SINCE I FIRST LAID MY EYES ON YOU.*

*But each time I saw you... you evaded my embrace, you hid from me... it's like you didn't want me... so I settled for the next best thing... your photos... your image.*

*Each and every time I consumed your image, I felt pure happiness, pure ecstasy running through my body as I digested your essence.*

*For a while, I've managed to do that in secret though... Until you saw me through that camera of yours.* 

*Tell me, my dear... did you like watching me consume your essence?... Did you feel anything as I ate you?... Tell me what you felt... I want to know... I felt so infatuated by your eyes watching me... and I wanted to meet you in person... but you hid from me? WHY? You locked me out? WHY? There's no reason to be afraid of me... I just wanted to embrace you and be embraced by you. STOP RUNNING FROM ME... STOP HIDING FROM ME...*

***Fiat mihil in.... FIAT MIHIL IN.***

I don't know what the last line meant, but honestly, I'm unsettled.

I thought asking the thing for answers would put some closure on this situation, instead, I'm just more.. terrified.

UPDATE:

The creature has grown more desperate. I saw it in the daytime... which doesn't make any sense... I thought it only showed up at night, now it's just popping up whenever it wants to!

What do I do?

UPDATE:

Well... it started destroying more than just my photos... I found broken plates, torn paintings and you guessed it: Eaten photographs.

This was growing out of hand... so I did something that you guys will probably be mad at me for... but I wrote a letter to the creature, and asked it to leave me alone, and stop destroying my stuff. You could say, I added fuel to the fire by doing that...

The creature did indeed respond to me in the form of a letter, with a shredded photo of myself, not one with a bite mark in it... and here's what it said:

***WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE, DARLING? I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SCARED OF ME, HUMAN, BUT DO NOT FEAR, I CAN HELP YOU SEE THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF...***

***You are fear-stricken... and I will EXTRACT that fear out of you, maybe then you will let me embrace you, my dear!***

***I will no longer wait for you to come to me... I WILL COME TO YOU...***

Now, I'm even more unsettled... it wants to 'extract my fear from me? What does that even mean?

FINAL UPDATE:

IT GOT IN... IT GOT INTO MY ROOM WHILST I SLEPT. IT BROKE THE LOCK... smashed my door to pieces and everything!

I woke up to my entire room trashed, and some sort of trail of black liquid from my bedroom doorway all the way to my bed. I thought that was bad.. but I found some of the liquid on my body! To make matters worse, there were bitemarks... DEEP bitemarks!

Next to my body was a note that read:

***~~YOU'RE MORE LOVELY IN PERSON....~~***

I tried to leave my house after discovering this... but the door was stuck... it wouldn't budge... it won't open! That means I'm trapped... trapped in here with this creature! A creature that wants nothing more than to 'consume my essence' whatever that means!

Please... what do I do????
