Hey, readers! Get ready for what I'm about to tell you because, yes, I went off the grid for four months. The reason? Well, reality decided to play games with me. When I tried to share my odyssey with friends and family, you know what happened? They called me crazy, can you believe it? They even came close to dialing the psychiatric ward.  
  
But here I am, dusting off the keyboard to tell you, because I know there are minds out there that will understand what happened. So, follow me, because the madness is just beginning...  
  
Remember when I told you the mannequin had come back? Well, something very strange happened, and I can't explain it without sounding delirious. The lights in the mall began to strobe. A feeling of vertigo washed over me, and before I could react, the lights exploded into a blinding glow. I instinctively closed my eyes to shield myself from the intense light.  
  
When I finally opened my eyes, I was in complete darkness. The feeling that time had distorted filled the air. In the distance, I heard the sound of something moving rapidly toward me. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what was happening.  
  
Suddenly, I felt something brushing against my leg. Unease took over, and I instinctively stepped back. The sound of footsteps continued, but now I could tell it wasn't one, but many. Were there more mannequins in motion?  
  
At that moment, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned sharply to face the unknown. It was the mannequin I had just left on floor -4. However, instead of an attacking stance, its hands were extended forward, as if trying to warn me. Just as I was about to react, the mannequin took my hand and quickly dragged me toward what seemed to be a secret door.  
  
We crossed an invisible threshold, and suddenly, the blinding light gave way to a secret room. The door closed behind us, and we were enveloped in a sepulchral silence. The room was lit by a dim glow, and upon closer inspection, I noticed that the walls were decorated with strange symbols and writings. In the center of the room, an antique pendulum clock marked time in a way that defied all logic.  
  
I realized that something had changed. My watch indicated that only a few minutes had passed, but the atmosphere suggested that much more time had elapsed. A shiver ran down my spine as I considered the possibility of having been trapped in this hidden dimension for months.  
  
Upon opening the door again, I was met with a bewildering sight. The mall was lit by daylight, and new employees went about their business as if nothing had happened. I rubbed my eyes, questioning my sanity.  
  
Approaching one of the employees for answers, I was met with bewilderment. According to their records, they had only been working there for a few days, and they had no idea who I was. Incredulity took over as I tried to understand what had happened.  
  
The grotesque rules and inexplicable experiences mingled in my mind, and a sense of desperation overcame me. Had it all been an illusion, or had I truly traversed an unknown dimension? The mystery of the mall seemed to have intensified, and my connection to time and reality grew increasingly fragile.  
  
Back home, I immersed myself in a warm bath, trying to shake off the weight of confusion. I sat at the computer, browsing the news as if nothing had happened. That's when I stumbled upon something chilling: a missing person's investigation where apparently, I was the main character. Me? Dead? The idea settled in my mind like an unwanted intruder.  
  
I remembered how, upon leaving the mall, people looked at me with disdain, as if I were an abomination. Children ran to their parents, frightened. As I reflected on that, an uncomfortable feeling set in. I realized I didn't feel the comforting warmth of my home. I went to the bathroom for a cigarette to calm my nerves. But when I faced the mirror, reality took an even stranger turn.  
  
My skin seemed normal at first glance, and my face, well, it looked like a face. But there was something odd. My pores had disappeared, and the pupils of my eyes, though deep, had a strange gleam, as if they were made of glass. As I examined myself, I noticed that my reflection made movements I wasn't making, a subtle but disturbing dance.  
  
Terrified, I left the bathroom, fervently wishing it was all a nightmare. As I lay down, the lack of sensation intensified. The soft sheet, the air conditioning, everything had become as if I were wrapped in impermeable plastic. Today, upon waking up, my disappointment deepened. The distorted reality seemed to be closing in around me.  
  
On the day I disappeared, there was an additional twist to the story that left everyone in the mall dumbfounded. They found an employee who had declared himself dead within the labyrinth of aisles and shops, but what was astonishing was that he returned from the supposed dead. However, something was deeply altered. He walked and talked, but his presence lacked that spark of life, as if the act of coming back had left his soul trapped in some indescribable place.  
  
I heard some murmurs in the hallways about how his gaze was empty, as if he had seen something unfathomable during his absence, something that had darkened the light in his eyes. The news spread quickly among the employees, creating a palpable atmosphere of tension. Some whispered about inexplicable presences and shadows twisting on the walls.  
  
The only certainty in the midst of this nightmare is that I must return to the mall. I don't want to face the consequences of letting this metamorphosis advance. I'll grab the manager by the shirt and force him to explain everything, even if it means hurting him. Fear and determination mix within me, and the dark reality of the mall eagerly awaits my return.  
  
So, dear readers, get ready to dive even deeper into this surreal plot. If I learned anything in these four months of absence — which for you were just a few paragraphs — it's that reality can be a twisted game, and the mall is the board. The next time I face the guard, the mannequin, or any shadowy entity, I know I can't underestimate the grotesque rules that govern this strange and dangerous place.  
  
Here I am, once again, with my harrowing tale. I don't know what fate holds for me on my next foray into the mall, but I'm determined to uncover the truth, even if that truth leads me to the same madness many believe has already consumed me.  
  
Will you join me on this journey? Just remember, the rules can change, the lights can flicker, and reality can bend and twist in unimaginable ways.
