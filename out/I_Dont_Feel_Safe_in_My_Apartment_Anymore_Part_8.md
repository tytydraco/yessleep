It’s been three days since my last update.

I didn’t go quiet because things got better. I went quiet because I needed to be sure I wasn’t just losing my grip. When you start to feel like you’re slipping out of your own life, you either cling to whatever you can or you stop talking long enough to listen.

I did both.

The first thing I did was order cameras.

Everyone here kept suggesting it, and honestly, it was the piece of advice that made the most sense. If something was happening inside my apartment while I wasn’t aware of it, I needed proof. Not feelings. Something I could point to and say that’s real.

They arrived yesterday morning. I set them up in the living room, the kitchen and the hallway facing my bedroom. Not fancy. Just cheap cameras that record continuously and upload to my phone. Nothing hidden. Nothing subtle. I didn’t want to play games.

Last night I stayed on the couch with the lights on, the camera app open on my phone. Three little windows showing three parts of my apartment. All of it normal. All of it still.

I watched myself sit there.

Nothing happened.

When my phone slipped out of my hand and hit the floor, I startled awake. My neck hurt from being bent forward. The screen was still on.

The feeds were still running.

I rewound the footage to see how long I had been asleep and if anything had happened.

Straight away I noticed a problem.

The time stamps were wrong.

There were chunks of time.

Just missing.

The living room camera skipped from 2:34am to 3:36am.

Sixty-two minutes gone.

The kitchen feed had lost fifty-seven minutes.

The hallway camera just over an hour.

I sat up straight, heart thudding. The cameras showed I hadn’t moved. I hadn’t stood. I hadn’t even shifted on the couch.

There were no motion alerts.  
No recorded clips.

I sat there for a long time, scrolling back and forth through it.

Not hoping to find movement.

Hoping to find anything.

But the gaps were always there.

There was no distortion. No static. No glitching.

Whatever happened during those minutes hadn’t been caught.

I was asleep the entire time. The cameras showed that clearly.

So why wasn’t it recorded?

The cameras didn’t fail.

They skipped and the gaps across them lined up too cleanly.

I told myself this could not have been a coincidence.

So I decided right then to go back downstairs to the lobby.

I didn’t have a plan. Just a pressure in my chest that wouldn’t let me sit still anymore.

The management office was dark. The hallway outside it was empty. The building had that late-night quiet it gets when everyone is asleep or pretending to be.

I tried the door.

The latch gave with a soft, too-easy click, like it hadn’t been meant to keep anyone out.

Inside, the office smelled like paper and toner and that faint disinfectant scent I’d noticed before. The desk was neat. The monitor was off.

I didn’t touch anything at first. I just stood there listening, half-expecting someone to tell me to leave.

But it remained silent.

The computer woke when I nudged the mouse. A login screen appeared. I stared at it, my mouth dry.

There was a small sticky note on the side of the monitor.

Four digits.

I typed them in.

The system opened.

I didn’t know what I was looking for, not really. I clicked through folders that meant nothing to me. Accounting. Maintenance. Scheduling.

Then I saw one labelled **CONTINUITY**.

It wasn’t a word I would associate with tenant management, so I clicked into it.

It opened into a list of reports.

Dates. Unit numbers. Short blocks of text.

My apartment was there.

Unit 2B.

I clicked on it and a simple report opened.

Time stamps. Duration. Status fields.

The most recent entries lined up perfectly with the gaps in my camera feeds.

The same hour.

The same minutes.

It knew exactly when they went blind.

I tensed up. But kept scrolling.

Where a tenant name should have been, there was nothing. Just a column labelled **ATTENTION LOAD**.

Numbers. Percentages.

Then I nearly fell backwards in the chair. Another line sat at the bottom of the page, in a summary box.

**Unit 2B currently providing adequate continuity. No intervention required.**

I just stared at it.

**Adequate continuity.**

**No intervention required.**

They had no record of me as a tenant.

But their report knew exactly when my cameras went blind.

Something in my apartment was being tracked and measured.

I took photos of the screen and went back upstairs, my hands shaking so badly I nearly dropped my phone.

Right now I’m sitting in my living room, looking at the cameras, staring at those numbers, trying to understand what part of me is still registered as present.

Because whatever the building thinks is happening in Unit 2B…

…it’s still happening inside my apartment.

And it doesn’t need me to do it.
