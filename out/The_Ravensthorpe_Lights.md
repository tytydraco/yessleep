I was listening to Stuff to Blow Your Mind the other day. Episode about will-o’-the-wisps. They talked about how they’re caused by marsh gas, swamp lights, that kind of thing. Mentioned how similar lights show up all over the world under different names, with different stories attached to them. Then they said Australia has them too. They’re called Min Min lights.

Something unlocked in my head. A memory from over a decade ago that I haven’t thought about since.

It was 2013. I was a year into uni, working a shit retail job on the side, when my mate Shane hit me up out of nowhere. I hadn’t seen him since high school graduation. He’d gone FIFO at a place called Ravensthorpe, a tiny mining town about six hours southeast of Perth. Middle of nowhere.

He said he was on break and wanted to go camping.

“Mate, you’ve gotta see the stars out here. Nothing like it.”

I thought, weird but why the fuck not? I packed my little beast, a 1994 Corolla held together by rust and optimism, with my tent and a few cartons of beer. Drove six hours through nothing but scrubland and silence.

I got to Ravensthorpe late afternoon. The town was busier than I expected, but still small enough that you’d briefly forget what crowds looked like. Shane’s place was just down the road from the pub. Massive shed, a couple of bikes out front, big lot of land. I probably would’ve caught the FIFO itch myself if it wasn’t so isolated.

Shane was out front, packing gear into his Pajero. He looked rough. Bags under his eyes, scruffier than I remembered. I asked if he was alright.

“Yeah nah, just got off night shift.”

I didn’t push it.

We repacked my stuff into his fourby and headed south, kind of towards Hopetoun. I’d expected more salt lakes, but it was mostly thick scrub with a few gum trees sprinkled around. Shane picked a spot in a small clearing near some rocks. Said it was one of a few places he came out to with the FIFO boys sometimes.

The sun went down fast out there.

We got the tents up, got a fire going, cracked a few tins. Shane wasn’t lying about the stars. The Milky Way was so bright it almost hurt to look at. We talked shit and caught up. We used to be close, back in high school. But something felt off. He kept losing focus mid-sentence, glancing over his shoulder at the tree line.

I finally asked him what was actually going on.

He was quiet for a long time. Then he told me.

A few breaks back, he’d been out here with some of the other FIFO guys. They saw a light in the bush. One of them, Macca, thought it was someone with a torch. Maybe playing a prank. Pissed and laughing, Macca headed towards it.

Shane said his stomach dropped. No reason he could explain. Just felt wrong.

He called out to Macca. Macca just laughed and said not to worry, it was obviously someone he knew. They were calling his name.

Everyone else went silent. They couldn’t hear anything.

Shane noticed the light was keeping the same distance, no matter how far Macca walked. By the time they realised what was happening, it was too late. The light was gone. So was Macca.

They panicked. Grabbed their torches. Spent all night searching through the scrub.

They found him in the early hours of the morning, curled up under a tree. He wouldn’t talk about what happened. Quit the mine two days later and moved back to Sydney.

Shane said he hadn’t slept properly since.

I sat there, staring at the fire, thinking: \*Why the fuck did you invite me out here?\*

He said he’d been seeing the lights himself. He felt like his FIFO mates were just feeding each other’s paranoia, convincing themselves something supernatural had happened when Macca had probably just gotten pissed, wandered off, and had some kind of breakdown. The bloke was probably on his way out anyway.

Shane said he wanted to come out here with someone who had a clear head. Someone who hadn’t been out here, hearing the stories, getting spooked.

He loved camping. He hated being at home. He just wanted things to feel normal again.

I didn’t know what to say. I figured he was just spooked and needed a distraction. So I tried to steer the conversation back to regular shit. Footy, work, whatever. But the vibe never quite recovered. His story stayed lodged in the back of my skull.

I started noticing Shane glancing over his shoulder every few minutes, scanning the tree line.

Then I started doing it too.

The air felt different. Like static building before a storm, or a sudden void where sound should be. I don’t really know how to explain it. It felt like we were being watched. Like something was out there in the dark between the trees, looking back at us.

I reminded myself of all the campfire stories I’d heard as a kid. Bunyips, yowies, the usual bush horror. I spooked myself even more.

I told myself I was being stupid.

Then I saw it.

A single light, maybe 300 metres away. Orange-ish, hovering about a metre off the ground.

My stomach dropped.

I pointed it out to Shane. Watched his face go white.

“Don’t look at it.”

“What?”

“I said don’t fucking look at it.”

He was dead serious. I looked away, but I could still see it in my peripheral vision.

It was getting closer. Drifting over the shrubs and between trees like smoke.

Shane kicked dirt onto the fire. “We need to go. Now.”

I was confused as shit, but his fear was contagious. He hadn’t mentioned anything about the lights \*chasing\* anyone.

We scrambled to the Pajero. I ended up in the driver’s seat somehow. Started the engine, flicked on the high beams. The light cut through the trees as I swung around toward the dirt track.

For a second, I saw it clearly.

Not a torch. Not a reflection. Just a ball of light, hanging over the scrub. The colour was wrong. Orange, but also \*not\* orange. My brain couldn’t make sense of it.

I took off down the track, scratching the side of the Pajero against branches as I cleared the site. I checked the rear-view mirror.

It was following us. Matching our speed.

“Shane, what the fuck is that?”

He was gripping the dash, eyes locked on the side mirror.

“When we got back to camp that night,” he said, “the old fellas at the mine started telling stories. Noongar blokes who’ve been out here for generations. They said that’s not a light. It’s something \*pretending\* to be a light.”

He paused.

“They call them Min Min. You follow them, you don’t come back.”

I floored it. I wasn’t used to dirt roads. Felt like I was going to lose control at any second doing 60. Any faster and we’d end up wrapped around a tree.

The light kept pace.

It was getting brighter.

Then there was a second one. Off to our left, weaving through the trees. Same height, same colour.

A third appeared on the right.

“Shane.”

“I know. Just keep fucking driving.”

The lights started drifting closer. I could see the glow reflecting off the ground beneath them. There was no source. No vehicle, no torch, no flame. Just light.

\*Wrong\* light.

The colour kept shifting, like it couldn’t decide what it wanted to be. Looking at it made me feel sick. Not just uneasy. Physically sick.

We finally hit sealed road. I remember feeling a massive bump, and suddenly I was doing 120. The lights kept up for a while, hovering at the edge of the bush. Then, one by one, they blinked out. Like switches being flipped off.

We drove in silence until we hit the turn-off into town.

I parked under the lights outside the hotel. Engine still running. We just sat there, shaking.

Shane finally spoke.

“I didn’t tell you everything.”

Here we go.

“The lights. I’ve seen them before that night with the boys.”

I turned to look at him.

“Been seeing them for months,” he said. “Started a few weeks after Nan died.”

Fuck.

“I’d be driving back from site, and I’d see a light off the road. Just sitting there. And I swear to God, mate. Sometimes it looked like \*her\*. Standing at the edge of the scrub. Waving at me.”

He was crying now.

“I know how it sounds. But the first few times, I thought I was just tired. Then one night I pulled over. Walked toward it a bit. It moved back. Same distance. Every time.”

“How many times, Shane?”

He didn’t answer for a while.

“I stopped counting.”

He wiped his face.

“It felt… safe? Like she wanted to show me something. I never went far. Just a little bit further each time. Then after what happened to Macca, I got scared. Stopped going out at night. But I kept seeing them. Outside the donga. At the edge of town. Everywhere.”

He looked at me, eyes red.

“That’s why I called you. I thought if someone else was here, someone who hadn’t seen them, maybe they’d leave me alone. Maybe I’d stop wanting to follow.”

I didn’t know what to say.

“Shane. You said they don’t chase people.”

“They didn’t.”

He looked at me.

“They’ve never chased me before tonight.”

Neither of us said what we were both thinking.

They got aggressive when he brought someone new. Either I broke whatever hold they had on him, or he brought them something they wanted.

“I need to go home,” I said.

Shane just nodded. Didn’t argue.

We went back to his place. My tent was still out at the campsite. Fuck it. I hopped in my Corolla and drove.

Six hours of dark highway. Jumping at every light in my mirrors. I didn’t stop until the sun was up and the servos were open.

I saw a post from Shane a few weeks later on Facebook. He’d moved back to Perth. I messaged him.

No response.

That was over ten years ago.

I’ve been thinking about reaching out again. See if he remembers. See if he’s okay.
