I found the dead man washed up on the beach on my third day at the new job. My first day was almost as bad. They didn’t want me and they wouldn’t like me; I knew all of that going in. What I didn’t expect was getting the silent treatment from every other ranger at the park.

“You shouldn’t take it personally, Ranger McCoy,” the head ranger told me as I closed the door to his office. “Everyone here was just expecting Marco to get the position. He was a great intern.”

George was middle-aged, with a black beard going gray at the edges. His office was full of old pottery, stone tools, and the top third of an entire wall was devoted to Native American weavings, particularly dreamcatchers, each one larger and stranger than the last.

I nodded toward the dreamcatchers.

“Are those local?” I asked.

George beamed, clearly proud of the collection. “All of them, yes. Most were made right here on the island.”

“Are they old?”

“Some of them are darn near ancient."

I smiled politely. My smile faded when I noticed one large dreamcatcher in the corner. At least, I assumed it was a dreamcatcher; it had the typical spiderweb swirl but instead of being a flat circle, it was three-dimensional, closer to a globe. The material used in the weave appeared unusual as well. It wasn’t string or twine but more leathery, rough and not at all pleasant to look at.

“Very…unique,” I said “Hey, I have a question if you don’t mind.”

“Shoot.”

I leaned in. “Are the stories about the park true?”

“Which stories?”

“That the park is haunted. Ghosts in the woods, shadows in the water, and campers going missing now and then. Is any of that-”

George shook his head. “I know everyone loves a ghost story but the scariest thing you’ll encounter at Snowfall is a pissed off pony.” He turned his attention to my open resume on his desk. “This is a pretty solid pedigree here, ranger.”

“Thank you, sir.”

“Don’t do the ‘sir’ thing here. The team is already inclined not to like you, sorry to say, and if you call me sir, they’ll think you’re sucking up. You can just call me, George. And please sit down. You’re making me nervous.”

I sat. “Okay, George. I’d rather go by Ashley, then.”

“Why, exactly, do you want to work at Snowfall, Ranger McCoy?”

“I…don’t.”

George raised a bushy eyebrow.

“I mean, I don’t have any issue working here,” I explained. “I’m happy to. It seems like a great park and I like being by the ocean. Actually, I used to come here a lot as a kid.”

“But you don’t want to work here?”

“I didn’t request being placed here is what I was trying to say. People here, you know, I’m sure they probably think that I stole your intern Marco’s promotion but I had nothing to do with the assignment.”

The older ranger was silent. He leaned back in his chair. I’d never seen anyone working so hard to look relaxed and I had no idea why.

George smiled and nodded. “I’m sure you’re a hard worker and a heck of a ranger. We’re just a little…unique at Snowfall and, prior to the current superintendent, we kept a lot of say locally in choosing our rangers. Marco was with us for two years between seasonal and probational and all of that. He had a lot of friends here. But they’re good folks and I know they won’t hold it against you.”

But they did.

There were three other full-time rangers other than George at Snowfall. Directly under George was the Assistant Head Ranger Jennifer. She was about the same age as her boss and had a presence I would describe as, “matronly.”

Gabe was in charge of the camping areas and supervised seasonal rangers in the summer. Other than maybe myself, he was the youngest of the Snowfall Shore group. I doubted he was more than twenty-five, tall and thin and animated when chatting with the other rangers.

Then there was Peter.

While George was polite but distant and Jennifer and Gabe were just distant, Peter radiated hostility.

Other than the collective cold shoulder and George disappearing after our conversation, my first day was uneventful. No one gave me anything to work or a place to work so I spent the day getting familiar with the park and wondering how many years I’d need to endure at Snowfall before I could fuck off to bigger and better things.

With no assignments or even trainings, I decided to spend my second day exploring the park. There was a spider-web of trails crossing Snowfall centered around half-a-dozen small inlets. I chose a trail at random that ran through the woods near the office and set off on a hike.

My goal was to see one of the infamous Snowfall ghosts. Stories claimed that hundreds of lost souls, many drowning victims from centuries of shipwrecks, wandered the park. When I was a kid, one of my friends told me they’d personally seen a specter, a faceless woman wailing and stumbling around the north beach at night.

I didn’t see any ghosts but I did encounter something that made my skin crawl. It was a tiny stick figure shaped like a person hanging from an elm right next to the trail. A tiny scrap of green fishing net was wrapped around the totem’s head like a mask. The object swung gently from a long piece of twine that was tied around the lowest branch of the tree. I chalked it up to eccentric campers just being weird.

One other moment stood from that trip through the forest. I rounded a bend to find a large rabbit in the middle of the trail. It had black fur and the brightest blue eyes I’d ever seen. And right in the center of each sapphire eye, a black iris big enough for me to identify even at a distance. The creature stood up when it noticed me, paws in the air. It looked to be nearly the size of a small cat.

“Uh, hello bunny,” I said, trying not to startle it. “Do you live around here?”

The rabbit stood completely still, watching me. Then one sharp ear twitched and it raced away faster than shadows in a basement when you flip the light switch.

“Bye, bunny,” I said.

The rabbit’s blue eyes stayed with me. There was something unnatural about them. The blueness reminded me of the ocean on a clear day, the dark irises like where the water goes from shore-shallow to open deep.

I looked back over the ocean before returning to HQ. For a brief moment, I thought I saw something in the water, a shadow like a fish just under the surface. But the silhouette was too large to be an animal. I decided it was a storm-shadow from one of the clouds above me. Then I turned around and quickly walked toward the office, the rabbit’s eyes blazing in my memory.

I got back to HQ around lunch time, hurrying at the end because the sky was beginning to look a little dark. The other rangers were gathered around Jennifer’s desk when I walked in. They were watching the radar. A wall of red was barreling down on the park only a few hours away. For my first official assignment, George tasked me with riding along with Peter to pick up a spare generator from the equipment shed.

Peter didn’t say a word to me for most of the trip, despite me hammering him with small talk. We passed a small group hiking one of the trails on our way. Two kids and, I assumed, their parents. The foursome waved as we drove by; Peter surprised me by waving back.

“Friends of yours?” I asked.

“Regulars. The Roberts family. They stay here every year. Dad is into fly fishing. Mom is a marine biologist. Nice folks.”

When we got back to headquarters, George thanked me and then told me to take the rest of the day, as well as the next day, off.

“We’ll just be doing storm cleanup,” he told me. “No need for the full crew. We’ll see you again the day after tomorrow.”

I decided on my drive home that, even if I wasn’t working, I wanted to spend more time getting familiar with the park. So I woke up while it was still dark the next morning, drank three cups of coffee, and headed to Snowfall to explore more of the trails.

I figured I’d start the day by watching the sunrise. The office parking lot was half-empty when I pulled in, which was strange but I assumed the rangers on-duty were out dealing with storm damage. I left my truck and took a short hike through the wooded area between our headquarters and the nearest slice of beach. The light was gray in the pre-dawn, made worse by the lingering clouds and a light drizzle.

There were little stick-men and stick-women and some that might have been animals, all hanging near the trail. Here and there, the stick figures had those tiny strips of old fishing net covering their faces. Halfway through the hike, I failed to spot roots winding across the path and nearly rolled my ankle.

“Shit, fuck, ouch.”

I pulled out my phone and turned the flashlight. When I did, I noticed that I had zero service, despite having full bars back at the office. I remembered George’s advice about always taking a radio out into the park and considered turning back, but I wasn’t sure if he meant even when I was off-duty.

“If I break my leg, I’ll just yell super loud,” I promised myself.

The rest of the trip to the beach was smoother with a light. My only regret was not wearing a better jacket since the rain was picking up. I stepped onto the sand, boots crunching as I rounded the first set of tall dunes. My eyes were on the ocean, a darker shade of gray than the sky above it. Whitecaps grew and broke and grew again while the wind snatched spray from the tips of waves. I could see the water clearly; the highest edge of the sun was already past the horizon.

I shivered against the chill, lost in thought and staring at the seas. There were gulls crying all around me; I didn’t notice the other birds among them until I saw a large shadow drift across the sand. I looked up to see buzzards coasting among the gulls, heavy and slow with those raw, red heads. Whatever the vultures were circling was just around the next cluster of dunes. I picked up my pace, worried that I’d find one of the island's famous ponies dead…or dying.

Once I was clear of the dunes, I saw the body.

Three vultures stood hunched next to the corpse. I was too far to be certain but I was pretty sure at first glance that I was seeing a dead man washed ashore. The body was facing the water, dressed in waterlogged clothes that looked like what you’d find on a lot of day-hikers and campers. As I approached, I heard the dull hum of flies.

A buzzard and half-a-dozen sea gulls took off when I came closer. I stopped twenty feet or so from the body, worried that I might already be disturbing the scene. But I wanted to at least see who the man was. An irrational fear that I might know the victim caused me to move in a wide circle so that I was nearly standing in the water and able to see the man’s face.

Except there was nothing there. The face was gone, peeled away to reveal bloody muscle and the hint here and there of bone. There were no features left, nothing but an open wound from his hairline down to his jaw.

“What the fuck.” I threw up, turning away so it landed in the ocean.

Shaking, I moved away from the corpse, not stopping until I was nearly back to the dunes. I sat in the sand and pulled out my phone, dialing 9-1-1 without taking my eyes off of the body. The vultures and gulls were back, pecking and pulling. The flies had never left.

The call didn’t connect so I tried again and again. I was breathing heavily when I dialed for a fourth time, almost on the edge of hyperventilation. It was too surreal, like a nightmare that lingered after waking. I kept shooting glances at the dead body, terrified that it might have rolled over while I wasn’t watching.

Taking a deep breath, I forced my eyes closed and counted to ten. When I opened them, the body was exactly where it had been since I walked onto the beach. I felt myself calming down and realized that my calls weren’t going to get through. There was zero service on the beach. I’d have to go back to the office for help.

I took one last look at the body sprawled on the beach then took off running over the dunes. The morning drizzle was turning back into rain by the time I reached the woods between the beach and headquarters. Even though the sun was up, it was darker than before dawn. I stumbled through the forest tripping over roots and rocks. At one point, I almost ran eye-first into one of the little stick-men that was hanging above the trail.

There were a few more trucks in the parking lot when I got back to headquarters. I nearly crashed into Gabe when I ran through the door. I’d taken the last quarter-mile of the return at a sprint and stood, winded and drenched, trying to convey to Gabe through a series of coughs and gestures that there was a dead body on the north beach.

Jennifer rounded the corner with a cup of coffee and watched me breathlessly pantomiming for a moment. Then she handed me the coffee, forced me to sit down, brought me a towel, and made me dry off and steady my breathing before telling my story.

“Dead man…north beach…” I wheezed. “...near trailhead…he…he’s been…mutilated.”

Gabe’s eyes went wide. “Mutilated? How?”

“Take your time,” Jennifer added, passing me another towel. “Breathe.”

“The body is bloated but fresh. His face is gone. Missing. Removed, I think.”

Gabe whistled. “Fucking crabs around here. Vicious pricks.”

I shivered. “I don’t think it was crabs or vultures or any animal that did it. Everything was too precise, too many straight lines. Too clean.”

“Do you need another towel?” Jennifer asked. “Or a blanket?”

I shook my head. “I’m okay. We need to call the police.”

Jennifer and Gabe exchanged a look.

“What?” I asked.

“We’re in DNR’s jurisdiction,” Jennifer said, heading for the radio room. “We should start with the Natural Resource Police. But this storm has them running around all over the island. Let me call George.”

“Fine, but we need to be out there with the body to make sure the scene isn’t disturbed.”

Gabe tilted his head toward the window. The rain had gone from a downpour to a solid wall of water. It lashed the windows and drummed the roof. A gust of wind shook headquarters, filling the building with a sound between a howl and a rasping whistle.

“The scene is already going to be disturbed,” Gabe said. “No real reason for us to drown standing out there waiting.”

I shook my head. “I found him, I’m staying with him. Come with me or stay here, either’s fine, just call it in.”

“Just did,” Jennifer returned with an extra rain parka and radio. She handed me both. “I’ll go with you.”

Gabe sighed but shrugged on his poncho and grabbed a set of truck keys.

“Just let me heat up some fucking coffee for the road and I’m with you.”

“I don’t understand.”

“What?” Gabe asked.

I raised my voice, trying to speak over the roar of the rain. “I said, ‘I don’t understand.’ The body, it was right here.”

Fifteen minutes after leaving headquarters, the three of us were standing on the beach, using the dunes for a windbreak. It didn’t help much. The storm was whipping sand and water across the shore while the rain came down nearly sideways. Temperatures were dropping and the sky and ocean were the same violent grey. The corpse I’d found earlier with its face removed was missing.

Jennifer took a step closer to me, shouting over the wind. “Are you sure this is the spot? Could it be further north?”

“No, I’m positive it was here by the trailhead. Shit. Shit. Why did you need to stop for coffee?”

Gabe held up his hands. “One, it's miserable out here and, two, it’s not like the body got up and walked off the beach.”

“Maybe it…maybe he washed away?” I guessed, scanning the beach again.

I became aware of a soft rumble getting louder, too quiet and too mechanical to be thunder or the crash of waves. George rounded the corner of the dunes on a four-wheeler, followed a moment later by Peter on another ATV. Both had their parka hoods cinched tight against the wind.

“Everyone okay?” George asked. “We were up north when we heard the call.”

“Living the dream,” Gabe replied.

I shot him a hard look. “Did you guys see the body? I was sure it would be right here but, uh, maybe I got mixed up in the storm. It’s close, though, I’m sure of that.”

“No dead folks on the beach between here and Point Bay,” Peter replied.

“We’ll check south for a quarter-mile or so,” George told me. “I’m sure we’ll find it.”

“You are?” Peter asked.

I got ready to snap back but saw George stare Peter down. The younger ranger shifted uncomfortably on his four-wheeler.

“Okay, yeah, we’ll find it,” Peter promised. “Hell, I’ve been here nine years and never found so much as a dead tourist in a bath house. You’re here two days and you already discovered a body on the beach.”

“Some people have all the luck, I guess,” I said but Peter was already driving off, disappearing into the rain and ocean mist.

“You did good,” George told me. “We’ll find the scene and then get MRP over here in two shakes.”

He took off after Peter. I stood watching until both were out of sight. It didn’t take long. Even their tire tracks in the sand faded under the relentless drag of the wind. In less than a minute, it was like the two rangers had never been there at all.

“Come on,” Jennifer shouted, tugging the arm of my parka. “Let’s get back to the truck before we drown.”

A deep rumble made me look around, expecting to see George or Peter zooming back to tell us they’d found the body. But this time, the rumble was thunder, followed quickly by a blue-black flash of lightning that connected the ocean and the sky like some bright, skeleton tree. I hurried after Jennifer and Gabe.

We lost power almost as soon as we got back to headquarters. Luckily, the backup generator was easy to get going. Gabe put on a new pot of coffee and the three of us stood looking out the windows at a scene that might have seemed familiar to Noah.

“What in the Hell kind of spring storm is this?” I asked. “It almost seems like an early hurricane.”

“Very early,” Gabe muttered.

Something about the tone of his voice caused me to raise an eyebrow but he just shrugged and handed me a mug of coffee.

“You must have been a barista in a former life,” I said.

“Sometimes feels like in this life, too.”

“Maybe we should call DNR now,” I said, resisting the urge to pace. “Get them over here to help look for the body.”

Jennifer put a comforting hand on my shoulder. “I’m sure George and Peter have already found it. They’re probably calling it in already then will head right back. Drink up, Gabe’s not good for much but he brings in the good coffee from home.”

I smiled and took a sip. It was pretty good.

“I have to bring in my own stuff,” Gabe said, “you could strip paint with the shit they stock in the breakroom for free. Damn budget cuts.”

“You spoil us,” Jennifer teased. “And on your own dime.”

“What can I say, I’m a giver.” Gabe put his hand next to his mouth to fake whisper to me. “But I steal so, so many office supplies to make up the difference. I built my nephew a playhouse just using stacks of Post-Its.”

I chuckled, smiling for the first time since I’d found the faceless man. But, again, the memory of the body came back as red and raw as its wounds. The white gulls circling, hard to see against the rain-swollen clouds above them. And the fat, black horseflies buzzing and crawling across the pink muscle of-

A wave of sudden exhaustion made me bend over, causing me to spill my drink.

“Ashley? Ash, are you okay?” Jennifer asked, moving next to me.

“Fine,” I lied. “I’m fine. I just might need to sit for a second.”

“Gabe, go grab her a chair. No, not that one, the one from George’s office. The comfy one. And get her another cup of coffee.”

George and Peter coasted into the parking lot on their ATVs before I finished my next mug. I stood up immediately, nearly vibrating as the pair fought the wind to get the door open and then closed again.

“Jesus,” Peter gasped, peeling off his rain parka and collapsing into the nearest chair. “It’s getting Biblical out there.”

“Well?” I asked, looking between the two. “Where did you find him?”

The two rangers shared a look.

“What?” I demanded.

“Why don’t we talk in my office?” George suggested.

“Look, I’m not crazy,” I said. “I didn’t imagine a dead body out there this morning.”

“Nobody is saying that,” George promised.

Peter cleared his throat but stopped when Jennifer glared.

“There’s a dead man out there,” I said.

“Missing his face?” Peter asked.

“Yes. Fucking yes. I know how it sounds but that’s what I saw.”

“You’re sure?” George asked. “You don’t have any doubts at all?”

“None. Zero. I’d swear on my life.”

George sighed and sat down, signaling Jennifer and Gabe to find chairs so we’d all be seated in a rough circle.

“Ashley, I want you to know that I believe that you saw something out on the beach.”

I bristled. “I know what I saw. I saw-” George held up his hand to finish. “Look, storms like this, no visibility, rain coming down like Heaven sprung a leak-”

“It wasn’t raining like this when I found the body,” I said, trying to keep a growing tint of anger out of my voice.

“True,” George admitted, “true. But it was raining. And there was mist, the cold fog that rolls off of the ocean here in the morning. It plays tricks on even us old-timers. Heck, this whole island is a little…weird. Haunted, even. Maybe.”

“Spooky as all get out,” Gabe agreed.

I took a deep breath. “I didn’t see a ghost. I didn’t imagine anything. There’s a dead man out there and if you’re not calling the police, I will.”

I got ready to stand up but felt faint again, dropping back into my chair.

“Are you okay?” Jennifer asked. “You look tired.”

“You do,” George agreed. “This has been a heck of a morning. Why don’t you lay down in the breakroom for a bit?”

My head was swimming. I took a long drink of coffee and rubbed my eyes.

“I’m not going to sleep. Not until I talk to the cops. What channel is NRP on the radio?”

Peter was watching me. For some reason, I thought he looked curious more than anything.

“It’s no good calling,” he said. “The natural resource guys and girls are all busy this morning with the storm and looking for the missing camper.”

“Missing camper?” I asked, stumbling a little over the last word.

I was actually feeling tired. Damn near exhausted.

“Peter…” George said quietly.

“C’mon, boss, you know she’s not letting it go.” Peter gave me a sad smile. “Dr. Roberts went missing last night. She wasn’t at her family’s campsite this morning. Might have wandered off.”

“Roberts?” I drawled. It was almost like I was drunk. “The…the…biol…biologist?”

“Marine biologist,” Peter corrected. “Nice lady. It’s a shame.”

The room was spinning and the rain sounded far, far away.

“Somethin…something not…right,” I said, using the back of my chair as support while I tried to stand.

The empty coffee mug slipped out of my now numb fingers. Jennifer caught me as I fell.

“You really should have taken George’s offer and slept today off,” she said, helping me back to my chair.

“She should have stayed the Hell home,” Peter muttered. “She shouldn’t be here, George. It’s not right.”

George was watching me, expressionless. His blue eyes seemed as gray as the ocean in the rain.

“Coming in on your day off,” he said. “That’s dedication.”

My last memory in the headquarters before the room went black was George disappearing into his office and several hands laying me gently on the floor.

The universe shook. I woke up feeling like I was drowning. Cold water splashed over my face, and I turned away, only to feel more water. For a panicked moment, I was certain I was drowning. Then something soft, warm, and damp wiped my face.

“Do you think that’s helping?” I heard Gabe ask. “The towel is soaked.”

“Just focus on driving and don’t let us fucking capsize,” Peter replied.

I opened my eyes, blinking against the rain. My vision was gray at first; as it cleared, I realized it was just the world that was gray. I was half-sitting, half-laying in a small boat rocking in the storm. As I tried to pull myself into a more comfortable position, I found that my arms were handcuffed behind my back and my legs were bound at the ankle.

“What the fff…” I slurred, still groggy.

“Sleeping beauty is awake,” Gabe said from somewhere behind me.

Peter was kneeling next to me. He leaned over to help me sit up straight but didn’t say anything. I did my best to get a full look at my surroundings. George was also in the boat, sitting near the bow, staring out across the water. There was a woman slumped behind him. It took me a moment to recognize Dr. Roberts since she was bundled up in a ranger parka but there was no mistaking the blonde hair plastered across her face.

The boat hit a wave and thumped down hard, causing the woman to slide. I realized that she was unconscious.

“What the fuck is going on?” I mumbled.

The wind snatched my voice away but Peter understood my look of confusion.

“It’s okay,” he shouted above the storm. “We’re almost at the cove. It will be calmer there. You’re okay.”

I tried to move, to struggle against the cuffs, but I was so tired. The best I could do was hunch over to keep the worst of the rain out of my eyes. Peter shifted and leaned toward me. The wind and rain let up ever so slightly.

I don’t remember most of the boat ride. I might have passed out again or maybe there just wasn’t much to remember other than the rain and the occasional roar of thunder and the endless gray above and below. Eventually, the boat stopped jumping and the wind died down until it was not much more than a heavy breeze. I sat up straight and looked around. Our boat was coasting across calm waters, a smudge of shoreline just visible maybe three- or four-hundred yards away.

“This cove isn’t on any of the maps,” George said without turning around.

I was surprised that I could hear him so clearly. The storm was barely above a spring bluster in the cove, though I could still see it raging dark and cold behind us where a break in the beach led back to the open ocean.

“Where are we?” I asked, glad to hear my voice was back and the fog was lifting from my mind. “What are you doing?”

George turned around and I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen a man in his middle years look so old.

“I’m giving you a choice, Ashley. A terrible, unforgivable choice, but I’m afraid it’s the only one I can offer you.”

“It’s one we knew we’d need her to make eventually,” Gabe said.

George leaned back and looked up at the clouds. “True. But it should have been years from now. Time when we could have prepared her, made her understand. Shit, remember how long it took you to understand, Peter?”

Peter didn’t reply. He was watching me and looked sad.

“It should have been Marco,” Gabe said. “That’s the whole point of the damn internship. Did you ever find out what happened?”

George turned, searching for something. “He had a breakdown. Killed himself last night. I just got the call this morning.”

“Damn,” Gabe said, crossing himself. “Poor little guy.”

Peter closed his eyes.

“What is happening? Tell me what the Hell is happening,” I demanded.

“I’m afraid I’m going to have to,” George replied.

He stood up and waved twice. I followed his gaze and saw that a second small boat, identical to our own, had anchored about thirty-yards away. Even in the drizzle, I could clearly make out Jennifer sitting in the vessel pointing a rifle at us.

At me, I realized. She’s pointing that at me.

George sat down. “Jenny is just there for insurance but she’s a crackerjack shot, so please don’t do anything…sudden.” I swallowed and stayed quiet. He continued. “What I’m about to tell you, Ashley, it’s going to sound, well, it’s going to sound crazier than a looney bin in an earthquake. But it’s the truth and I promise you’ll believe me. And I’m very sorry for that.”

The Roberts woman was waking up slowly, groaning.

“Miss? Dr. Roberts? Can you hear me?” I said. “M’am, you’re going to be okay. We’re fine.”

George smiled. “Good makings of a ranger. I knew it as soon as I saw you. But, and I’m eternally sorry for this, only one of you is going to be fine.”

I felt like I’d fallen into a tub of ice. I could hear my pulse thumping in my ears and my mouth was suddenly dry.

“You don’t have to hurt anyone,” I whispered. “Whatever this is, you don’t have to.”

“True,” George agreed. “But you do.”

He turned his back to me and began rummaging around in the storage area at the bow. Briefly, I considered throwing myself at him. Maybe I could knock him overboard if I took him by surprise. But I felt Peter shifting next to me, maybe sensing the adrenaline firing through my bloodstream. And then there was Gabe behind me and, of course, Jennifer nearby with her rifle ready. I slumped, realizing that whatever was about to happen, there wasn’t anything I could do to change it.

George turned around holding two duffle bags. They were olive green, bland, the kind that you could find in any army surplus story in the country. He sat the bags down next to the captive woman.

“First, I do want you to know, you’re not at all crazy,” the old ranger told me. “You did find a body on the beach this morning. I apologize for lying to you but you weren’t supposed to see that. The whole reason I gave you off was to keep you away from the park today. Sure is bad luck you came in anyway and worse luck you couldn’t be talked out of pulling the cops into this.”

“You moved the body?”

“Yep, me and Pete while the others kept you occupied. We were out looking for the guy, anyway. We knew he’d be washing up.”

“You knew? Did you…are you the one who-”

George nodded. “Killed him? Technically, no, it was Gabe’s turn, but from a philosophical point of view, we’re all guilty of it.”

“Why?” I whispered.

“We had to. We have to send one down every three or four years.” George splashed the surface of the water with his fingertips. “It used to be only once a decade or so when I was younger but she’s been restless lately.”

“I…I don’t understand.”

“There’s a thing sleeping under the water here. We think it’s probably at the bottom of this cove but it might be somewhere deeper. All I’m sure of is that this little inlet is a special place. The weather’s always nicer here and this is where she likes her meals.”

I kept glancing Dr. Roberts. Her eyes were flickering behind closed lids. She’d be conscious any moment.

“Who is, ‘she?’” I asked.

George was staring into the water. “I’m not actually sure she is a ‘she.’ That’s just the impression that I got the one time I, uh, communicated with her. You’ll see what I mean.”

I scooted closer to the head ranger. “Listen, whatever this is, the woman is still out cold. Drop her off on the shore. Just let her go.”

“I don’t think you want to make that choice quite yet,” George replied. “This will be easier if I just show you.”

He opened the first duffle bag.

“I’ve been saying just show her from the beginning,” Gabe said. “Rip off the band-aid.”

“She needed context,” George countered, pulling a clear plastic box from the bag.

It looked like a shadow box, the large, clear plastic kind you’d use to display an autographed football or basketball. There was something large and flat inside of the case.

George held it closer. “Take a look, Ashley.”

“This is some kind of insanely tasteless prank, right?” I asked, glancing around the boat. “Or are you all completely fucking nuts?”

“Ashley,” George repeated, bringing the box closer. “Look.”

I did. For a long moment, every thought left my head. Then one came rushing back in and I couldn’t stop screaming. Inside of the box was a face, pulled taught and hung on thin wires. The eyes and mouth were open holes, the cheeks pale but remarkably life-like. There was even a hint of a five o’clock shadow on his jaw. Though I’d never seen the dead man on the beach while he was whole, I was certain I was looking at his well-preserved face.

I turned away to throw up over the side of the boat. Gentle but insistent hands pushed my temples so that I was facing the box again.

“I’m sorry,” Peter said. “But you have to see all of it.”

“No. No.” I jammed my eyes shut.

George sighed. “Either open your eyes or I’m going to have to push Dr. Roberts into the water.”

Whimpering, I slowly opened my eyes to look at the face.

It was moving.

I stared, unable to understand what was happening. The dead man's mouth was opening and shaking while his face convulsed. It was as if he was silently screaming.

“Jesus. God,” I whispered. “What? How?”

George, thankfully, returned the box to the duffle bag. “As I’m sure you guessed, that belongs to the fella you found this morning. It was sitting still as a picture up until yesterday afternoon when it all of a sudden started…well…you saw. That’s one of the signs that she’s waking up. When we send one down to her, we’re supposed to keep the faces. It’s sick but those are just the rules that got passed down. The face acts as a warning that the bitch is restless. That and the storm. Then it’s time for a new sacrifice.”

“This is evil,” I said.

George nodded. “Maybe. But what we do here at Snowfall, it goes back a long time, Ashley. Like, before this was a park, before there was a town. Even before the first Europeans built a couple of stick sheds and called it a colony, the local tribes were sending down sacrifices to keep this thing sleeping. One life every few years might be evil but the last time something like her woke up, I understand a whole colony disappeared in North Carolina. This thing is ancient, Ashley. And it only tolerates us as long as we keep it fed and dreaming satisfied dreams."

A sudden, mad panic made me try to rip my hands through my cuffs. To Hell with the bastards and Jennifer and her rifle. I would not let them skin me alive and throw me into the ocean.

“Easy,” Peter said, pinning my arms. “Easy. I know. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. But everything he’s saying is true.”

“You’re all fucking crazy,” I screamed, feeling like I was losing a grip on my own sanity. “You’re sick. There’s nothing down there. You’re just murderers.”

George opened the second duffle bag. “I was hoping the face would be enough to convince you but I understand it’s a lot to take in.” He pulled out a device made of sticks and what looked like strips of leather. I recognized it as the strange dreamcatcher from his office. “I’m sorry about this part,” George said, placing the object over my head. “I’m sorry about all of this but this in particular.”

“What are you-”

The netting came down until my head was covered. Instantly, I knew I wasn’t on the boat anymore. I was standing on a wide, black beach at night. The sky was clear but discolored, like a fresh bruise slowly going purple. There was a full moon hanging above the horizon but it was wrong, too. It was far too large and seemed so close I was worried it would fall into the ocean. There was only one star; a bright red one that I couldn’t look at for long. It was like a wound just before it began to bleed.

I shivered and crossed my arms. My cuffs were gone and my legs were also free. It was cold, colder than anything I’d ever felt before. Despite the clear conditions, the ocean was rough. Whitecaps stood and hung and crashed down, breaking at the shoreline.

There was something in the water. Many things.

People.

Each was missing their face but somehow all of them were screaming, clawing at the blank flesh where their faces should be. The sound was horrible, a muffled gurgle that was amplified to a buzzing wind by the hundreds or thousands of throats that were trying to shriek. A large wave pushed a dozen of the naked, squirming figures onto the beach. Most were stunned but a few tried to crawl away. Before they could, a human hand the size of a small parking lot emerged from the water and raked the sand with fingers like huge, crooked trees.

The miserable things were dragged back into the tide. Another gigantic hand was rising from the ocean, then a second, and a third. They towered above me, blocking out the light of the swollen moon. I screamed-

\-and kept screaming as someone pulled the dreamcatcher from my head and shook me.

“Ashley, Ash.” Peter’s voice. “It’s okay. I know it’s awful but you’re safe. You’re not there. You’re not there.”

“Not yet,” Gabe said.

I opened my eyes to see Peter glaring at the other ranger. Gabe was looking out over the calm waters, an unlit cigarette in his mouth. He flicked his lighter and cupped his hands but couldn’t get it going in the drizzle. Sighing, Gabe tossed the cigarette into the ocean.

“Don’t litter,” George said, putting the twisted dreamcatcher back into the bag. “You saw the beach, right?”

I was shaking uncontrollably, unable to answer. My screaming had woken Dr. Roberts. She was looking around the boat, confused but growing more afraid by the moment.

“What’s this? Where?” she mumbled. “Dan? Dan…the kids…”

“I know what you saw,” George said. “We’ve all seen it, too. This cove…I guess it’s like a window, or better yet, a doorway, to wherever fucked up place she calls home. We send her food but not just to eat. She keeps them forever, she feeds on their pain and their minds and their memories. An ocean of screaming. Hell of a lullaby.

"Remember I said that I’d need you to make a choice, Ashley? Now is the time. We do a terrible but necessary thing here. You weren’t supposed to discover it so soon but the cat’s out of the bag. So now we all need to know you really have what it takes to be a park ranger at Snowfall.”

I shifted my gaze from George to the camper handcuffed next to him.

“No,” I said. “No. No. No.”

The old ranger held up his hands. “That is one of the answers you can give but I strongly suggest you take a moment to consider your situation. No matter what happens, the doctor here will be sent down. There’s no way around that. You only get to decide if you are going to be the one to send her…or if you’re going down with her. I’ll give you two minutes to decide.”

“What is going on? Let me go,” the camper mumbled in a haze.

George slipped a gag between her teeth. “I’m sorry doc but the ritual requires you to be awake. Bad, bad luck. Try to put your mind in a happier place.”

“Ashley,” Peter said, leaning down to put his face close to mine. “You have to do this.”

“I can’t,” I whispered. “I can’t.”

“If you don’t, you see where you’ll be going.”

I started sobbing, nearly hyperventilating, but he was right. The only thing I could imagine being worse than killing that poor woman was going into the water with her. So when George told me my time was up and he offered me a bone-handled knife, I took it with the one hand they let free. Gabe and George dragged Dr. Roberts close to me and forced her head still while Peter kept one hand on my wrist just in case I tried to stab one of them or myself.

George told me what to do, where to cut, and Peter helped counter the shaking in my hand. Even with the gag, I’ll never, until the day I die, forget the sound the camper made while I worked at her face. It’s a sound I hear in my nightmares now, along with the buzz of flies, and a wind that moans.

When I was done, George placed the dreamcatcher over her head. Gabe and Peter tossed her, still screaming, over the side of the boat. As soon as she hit the water, the remains of the storm began to clear. By the time we made it back to headquarters, the sun was shining brightly and the air smelled like it had the edge of summer on it, clean and warm.

No one spoke a word the entire trip back. They let me loose from my bonds. Gabe even offered me a cigarette. Peter had to light it for me; I was shaking too badly to use the lighter. He also helped me collapse into a chair when we were back in the office and brought me a blanket. George brought me a mug of tea that smelled like honeysuckle and citrus. I eyed the cup suspiciously.

George laughed. “Don’t worry, nothing in your drink this time. No need. [Welcome to the team.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grand_Theft_Motto/comments/1nf3siz/story_notes_the_body_tide/)”
