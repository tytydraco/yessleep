I don’t care if you believe me.

Honestly, I’d prefer it if you didn’t. That would mean you never find this place. That would mean whatever it was doesn’t get any more attention.

But if you’ve ever felt it—really felt it—then you already know.

There’s something wrong in the woods.

I went hiking last weekend. Solo. Dumb, I know, but it’s something I’ve done a dozen times before. I’m not some influencer or adrenaline junkie—I just like the quiet. The stillness. It helps shut out the noise in my head.

The trail was one I hadn’t tried before. A friend sent me the GPS marker, said it was “real peaceful” and “a little off the grid.” No reviews. No photos. Just coordinates and a shrug emoji.

That should’ve been the first red flag.

I drove out Saturday morning. The road leading up to the trailhead wasn’t paved—just dirt and loose gravel, barely wide enough for my truck. No signage. No ranger station. Just a rusted gate leaning off its hinge and a crude wooden marker with the number “33” carved into it.

No one around.

I started hiking around 10 AM. The first hour was exactly what I wanted—dense trees, steady incline, nothing but birdsong and the wind through the canopy. My phone dropped signal about a mile in, but that wasn’t unusual.

The second hour was when I noticed something was off.

The trees started looking too similar. Like copy-pasted assets in an old video game. Same bark patterns. Same knots. Same cluster of moss on the north side.

I chalked it up to fatigue.

But then I saw the deer.

It was maybe twenty yards ahead, partially behind a tree. I only noticed it because of the antlers—long, too many points, almost tangled in shape. It stood perfectly still. I mean perfectly. No twitch. No breath. No blink.

I watched it for a full minute before realizing something else was wrong.

Its legs were bent… backwards.

Not just wrong for a deer—wrong for any animal.

I stepped back slowly. Didn’t run. I’ve seen what happens to hikers who panic around wildlife. But as I backed away, the thing stepped forward.

Its hooves didn’t make a sound. Not even on the dry brush.

That’s when it tilted its head—not like an animal, but like a person hearing something they don’t quite understand. Slow. Curious.

Then it said my name.

“Eli.”

Not a growl. Not a screech.

Just… my name. In a flat, male voice that sounded like me. Like someone had recorded me saying it and was playing it back through blown speakers.

I ran.

I didn’t think. Just turned and tore back the way I came.

Only… the trail was gone.

No path. No markers. No footprints.

Just trees. Miles of trees that all looked the same.

I stopped when I couldn’t breathe. My chest felt like it was going to split open. I leaned against a trunk and tried to get my bearings.

That’s when I heard it again.

“Eli.”

Closer this time. Off to my left. And then again—right behind me.

“Eli.”

The third voice was wrong.

It sounded excited.

I don’t remember falling, but when I opened my eyes, the light had changed. It was dimmer. Not quite dusk—but the kind of dim that makes you feel like something’s watching you breathe.

I stood up and realized I’d lost my backpack.

Gone. No trail. No water. No compass.

Only the trees.

I walked for hours. I don’t know how long. The shadows didn’t move. The sun didn’t shift. At one point, I found a small clearing and thought maybe—maybe—I could get my bearings.

There was something in the middle.

At first, I thought it was a scarecrow. But it wasn’t made of wood or cloth.

It was antlers. Dozens of them. Twisted together into a spire, some still wet at the base. Flies buzzed around it, but there was no smell. No rot.

Just wrong.

And carved into the dirt in a perfect circle around the structure—my name.

Over and over.

“ELI ELI ELI ELI”

I didn’t scream. I don’t know why.

I just turned and walked back into the woods.

At some point, I started seeing movement in the trees. Not animals. Not people. Just shapes. Wrong shapes. Sometimes they walked on four legs. Sometimes two. Sometimes they just watched.

Always silent.

Always still.

At one point I stopped by a creek to rest and splash my face.

When I looked up, the reflection didn’t match me.

Same face. Same clothes. But it smiled.

I wasn’t smiling.

I ran again.

Eventually, I found something—an old fire pit, burned low. Still warm. Signs that someone had been there recently. I called out. Waited.

Nothing.

Until the breathing started.

It wasn’t close. It wasn’t far.

Just steady. Like something big. Waiting.

I crouched, trying not to make a sound.

The breathing stopped.

And then I heard it walking.

Not toward me.

Around me.

Circling.

And with each pass, I could hear it saying my name. In different voices. My voice. My mom’s voice. My ex-girlfriend’s voice. A stranger’s voice.

And then one that didn’t sound human at all.

Just raw air dragging across vocal cords that weren’t built for speech.

“Eliiiiiii…”

The fire pit went cold. The embers snuffed out without wind.

I bolted.

At some point, I tripped. I remember hitting my head. Hard.

When I woke up, it was daylight again. Bright. Morning.

I was lying beside my truck.

The keys were in my pocket.

My backpack was in the passenger seat.

I drove home in silence.

When I got to my apartment, I found something stuck under the windshield wiper.

A branch.

Small. Twisted.

Still wet.

It wasn’t until I was inside that I saw what was carved into it.

Five letters.

“WATCH.”

It’s been three days.

Every time I try to sleep, I hear it again. That voice. That breath.

I haven’t looked in the mirror since I got back.

Because last night, I caught my reflection smiling again.

And I wasn’t.
