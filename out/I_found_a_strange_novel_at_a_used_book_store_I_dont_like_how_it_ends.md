On the weekends, I like to go to used book stores. I know that the internet has kind of made books obsolete, but there’s just something I enjoy about walking around and looking at all the books people have read even if I never plan on reading them myself. Sometimes you see something that just looks absolutely terrible and you wonder to yourself who the author actually thought their intended audience was going to be. Case in point, look at the horror genre. The used book stores are lined shelf to shelf with shitty horror novels that are all essentially just variations on the same few ideas. The instant something actually original comes out a hundred hack writers fart out their own version of it, and then any charm the original idea had is completely gone.   
  
To be honest, it’s ridiculous to me that something like the horror genre even exists in fiction. I don’t know how anybody could possibly read a story and then get scared by it. Movies, at least there are audio and visual components. I think I only got scared by a movie one time, anyway. It was this Japanese movie called Noroi. The first half has these fake news reels that have this vibe where it’s like something you’d see on some obscure website in the early 2000s. There were all sorts of strange videos and images that you would find back then and they would always have some kind of backstory attached to them and you were never really sure how much of it all was real. I suppose that’s what made it scary, was that uncertainty.  
  
Anyway, that’s why I like going to used book stores. Sometimes I even buy stuff while I’m at them. Usually what I’ll do is I’ll just pick out books at random, skim a few pages or read the back cover or something like that, and then see how I feel about the whole thing. I’ll take my chances every once in a while. The books only cost a few bucks, anyway, so if they end up sucking it’s not a huge deal. I read this one book that was like an encyclopedia of racial slurs and for each one it gave like the origin and its historical context and some examples of its usage. At first I thought it had been written as a joke but there was way too much effort put into it for it to be a joke. Also, it was written in the 1980s, back when people were really serious about being racist towards each other. Even if I don’t condone the contents, it was an interesting read.  
  
Now, on the particular occasion that I’m describing I was going through the general fiction section and had pulled out a book titled “A Simple Man” by a guy named Lance Jack. The back cover didn’t really tell me much about the book, so I flipped to a random page and started reading. It seemed to be describing the morning routine of the protagonist, a man named Claude. He woke up, took a shower, ate breakfast, and then went off to work. I skipped ahead a bit. Claude was getting fired from his job. I skipped ahead a little more. Claude was looking for a new job but couldn’t find anything that appealed to him. I suppose that sounds boring, but it had been a while since I’d purchased anything at a used book store and this particular book was giving off some pretty good vibes. So, I guess I should say that I bought it on a whim. It was only two dollars, anyway, so I wasn’t too worried about my investment not paying off.  
  
I started reading the book when I got home. It opened with Claude’s childhood in southeastern Oregon. At school, he was too shy to make friends and spent most of his free time reading and watching movies. He eventually managed to fall in with a group of guys that were kind of like him, but not really. I’m sure you know how those things go. After high school he went to college and studied computer science. He didn’t love computer science or anything, but he also didn’t dislike it enough to change majors. He just kind of put up with it. After he graduated he moved on to different IT jobs, and that’s about as far as I managed to read. Obviously a lot more happened than that, but I’m just giving a sort of broad outline of things.  
  
As I read the book, I began to notice a lot of strange – I guess you would call them “coincidences”. Well, I was born in southeastern Oregon, too, and in the same year as Claude – 1992. The general pattern of his life matched mine thus far, but more concerning were the specifics. When Claude was 7, he was run over by a golf cart and broke a leg. When he was 9, he played Ocarina of Time and developed a sexual attraction to Princess Ruto. When he was 14, he tried asking his crush out on a date and then threw up on her, and then for the rest of the year everyone called him “Barf Boy”. When he was 17, he was tricked into going to prom with one of his bullies who had dressed as a woman, who revealed the truth just as Claude was going in for a kiss. When he was 20, a bear attacked him while he was hiking and he was forced to kill it using a makeshift spear. And so on. All of these things happened to me, too, exactly as they happened to Claude. I was stunned, to say the least. This was my life that I was reading. The only difference was the names of the characters.  
  
I didn’t pick the book up again until about a week later. Something like that takes a while to really come to terms with. After a few days, though, I started to get curious. I mean, everything I’d read so far matched my life perfectly, but if I kept reading I would eventually reach today, and everything after that would be the future. Would those things happen, too? I mean, the book had just been lying on that shelf for who knows how long. When had it even been written? There was no publication date, and I couldn’t find any information about the author online. I had to keep going, just to make sure. Just to see for myself.  
  
And so I read, and before long I found the point where the past and the future split away (colloquially, this place is known as the “present”). Claude was trapped in a state of melancholy because he didn’t find his job fulfilling. He didn’t have much going on outside of work, either. Anybody he’d once considered a friend had moved away long ago, and he found it hard to muster the energy to go out and meet new people. Then, one day, he was suddenly fired from his job for “performance issues”. I vaguely remembered that part from when I’d first skimmed the book, and while I was definitely in a state of melancholy I had not yet been fired from my job. So, I told myself that I would put the book away and try not to think about it, and if I got fired in the same way Claude did then I’d really freak out.  
  
It happened a couple of months later. I was called into the boss’ office and given the same speech that Claude was given in the book. I was a valuable employee but lately my performance just hadn’t been up to par and, unfortunately, they were replacing me with someone else. Something like that. Well, I knew from the start how this whole thing was going to go, so I just sat there and took it. There were other things on my mind.  
  
Once I was back at my apartment, I pulled the book out of its hiding spot and spent a long while just staring at it. I guess this is something that everybody thinks about at some point or another – if you could know the exact day you would die, would you want to? Maybe some things aren’t worth knowing. Maybe they are. Staring at the book, it was hard to really say which side I was on. I supposed that it wouldn’t hurt to read ahead a little. To be honest, my life sucked, so if I knew I had something to look forward to in the future, maybe that would cheer me up. Maybe I’d run into the woman of my dreams while looking for eggs at the grocery store. Maybe the NFTs I’d sunk so much money into would suddenly become profitable and I’d never have to work again. Maybe anything would happen to get me out of this mental rut I’d been in for who knows how long.  
  
Once again I read, onward and onward, chapter after chapter, waiting for something exciting to happen. And then, the book was over. Claude died alone in his apartment, the same apartment he’d lived in his entire adult life, at the age of 63. Nobody mourned for him, nobody cared, and nobody was even aware that he’d ever existed. I couldn’t believe it. I’d read a lot of books in my time, but this one was by far the most boring. It was depressingly boring. In that moment, a deep sense of dread overwhelmed me and I wanted to scream out to someone, but I didn’t because there was nobody to scream out to. This was my life, and all that lies ahead is a void filled with mindless work and people I can’t stand to be around and a stinging desire to try to make things better. The truth is that things will never get any better. That’s what it says in the book, after all.  
  
I spend a lot of time these days lying in bed and staring up at the ceiling. I tell myself that if I can just do something spontaneous, something that goes against what’s in the book, I’ll prove to myself that my life isn’t bound to its pages. But when I think of going out and meeting people or trying something new, I can’t convince myself to follow through. Why is that? It feels like I have writer’s block, only in my brain. Maybe I could try joining something like a book club, I say to myself. Where? How? Which? Would I even enjoy it? Would I even have the energy to go there? Would I even like any of the other people there? Would they like me? Answer one question and two more pop up, like some kind of fucked up verbal hydra. I suppose that some people can ignore all that shit and just go for it, but I can’t.   
  
Sometimes I watch movies to try to hype myself up. You know the one by the guy that made Heat, where Tom Cruise is the bad guy? He gives this little speech to the protagonist, tells him that sitting around and waiting for his dream to come will just end up with him wasting his life away. When the movie’s over I think to myself yeah, it’s time to go out there and do something! My dream is waiting out there and I need to go grab it! But then I wonder to myself what my dream even is. I suppose there’s nothing like a dream inside me, just a cold, dark longing to exist among others like me. Does that count as a dream? I read through the book again, looking for a hint, but Claude is just the same as me. He lays in bed and wonders why his brain’s the way it is. Claude in ten years is no different from the Claude of today, who is no different from the Claude in twenty.   
  
With each day comes a little more dread. Everything that’s happened since I found that book has matched it perfectly, continues to match it perfectly. I’m marching towards an inevitable conclusion, one that’s already been written out for me. Maybe the only thing I can really do is learn to accept my fate. Maybe instead of living in fear I can live in quiet complacency like a barn animal inside its pen. Be honest, what else could a guy like me possibly do?
