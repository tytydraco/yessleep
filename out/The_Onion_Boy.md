The Onion Boy does not sleep, for this is the time in which he furtively toils, collecting and consuming dreams. His appetite is never satisfied. He moves on to the next sleeping victim with the priors still weighing freshly in his stomach -- for he is confident it will be digested in time for his next meal.

Please, if you could spare a moment, I will tell you about the first time The Onion Boy visited me. It was my first year of college, and I had the world at my fingertips. I had just started dating a beautiful girl with long, flowing amber hair. I clung to every word that spilled out of her coy, curled lips as if it were gospel, and I was her disciple. We made love under the moon and drank during the day, using what precious time afforded us as young gods. I was deliriously happy.

But fate saw my happiness and could not abide its impetuosity. There was another who began to feel the glowing warmth of her attention. She started to make excuses on the days when we planned to meet. She would “forget” her mother was coming into town and be indisposed the whole weekend. I could no longer walk her home from the library at night because she was with her “friends,” all the while careful to avoid using any identifying pronouns that may signal another cock was in the roost. I’d like to say I was patient with her, but I sensed something amiss from the jump.

My suspicions were affirmed after many long nights trailing her and dodging behind shrubs when she felt my presence. But she never caught me. Not even that one night, that horrible, dreadful, terrible night I spent in the tree outside her window. It was then that I finally saw him -- her new lover. With gossamer curls that fell over his adonis-like face, I knew I could not compete. I had lost.

That night, I tossed and turned in my sweaty bed, my consciousness adrift in the twilight zone between sleep and wake. Every time I closed my eyes and tried to drift off into a peaceful slumber, I saw them rolling around in her satin, floral sheets. I caught the love and magnificence in her gaze, which stung from the knowledge that it was promised to another. With each recollection of this horror, I was jolted awake.

This went on for weeks, drifting off to sleep, only for my blood to become electric as I was awakened by my horrible memories. I knew no peace. It was on the third day that I first encountered The Onion Boy.

“Dost thou miss your delightful fantasies?” he croaked. The aura of death clung to every word that drifted from his mouth. “Replaced by vile visions?”

“Who are you?” I asked shakily.

“I can take it away,” he hissed. “The pain, the suffering, the memories.”

I flicked on my bedside lamp, and there he was, a little boy, no older than twelve, wearing a Victorian newsboy outfit. He had a shock of shaggy, white, blond hair that fit under his cap, and a disquieting grin. His body was pale and decaying, with pock-marked skin that barely clung to his skeleton. Small maggots wriggled in the abscesses that littered his body.

“I am hungry,” he said. “Please, allow me to relieve your pain. Allow me to feast!”

“Begone!” I screamed.

His spirit dissipated, but that was not the last of The Onion Boy. He visited me every night, singing songs of death and recounting the dreams he had consumed that night. All the while, my own nightmares continued to plague me. I couldn’t get the image of her lips pressed against his out of my head.

On the twelfth day, I finally relented. The Onion Boy came, as he always did, heralded by the stench of rot and decay.

“Are you prepared?” he asked.
	
“Please,” I begged. “I’ll do anything. Just please make it stop.”
	
“As you wish,” he said with a smile. “Now, please lay back and close your eyes.”

I did as he asked, and The Onion Boy began his tale. He told me of how he became a consumer of dreams, a demon of the night. 

He used to be a regular boy named Isaiah who, like me, became consumed by nightmares. The visions of his mother’s horrible passing came to him every night, torturing and shocking him awake any time he tried to seek salvation through the unconscious. He was willing to do anything to make it stop. 

Then, The Onion Boy approached Isaiah and offered him a deal: listen to his tale, and he would bring relief by consuming the nightmare that plagued him. He laid down and listened to his tale, and in the end, the specter consumed his dream as promised. The Onion Boy left Isaiah, who drifted to a peaceful, uninterrupted sleep. 

He was happy for precisely three days before the hunger set in. A deep, gnawing pain that nipped at his ribcage. No amount of food or books or candy that brought Isaiah joy would satisfy this hunger.

That night, The Onion Boy returned to Isaiah.

“What did you do to me?” Isaiah asked.

“Nothing that wasn’t done to me before,” he said. “The only way to rid yourself of this curse is to pass it on to another, just as I have. Remember, the story must always begin the same.”

At this point, I realized what Isaiah was doing and bolted from my bed, but it was too late—just as it is too late for you now.

“I’m sorry,” he said, a plaintive look painted on his face. “The story begins: ‘The Onion Boy does not sleep, for this is the time in which he furtively toils, collecting and consuming dreams…’”
