We ran into the Eye Ripper house and locked the front door. I closed the curtains of the front windows but not before seeing the wraiths we had disturbed in the forest flood onto the pavement. Some of them shambled, some of them floated, some of them sprinted, some of them even seemed to glitch forward like they were teleporting.   

Yazmine shuddered and hugged herself as she sat on the sofa pushed against the wall. It was just a minute before those things began banging on the front door, a cacophony of ghostly utterances bleeding through into the house. 

“Come on, we're going into the basement,” I whispered as I tugged Yazmine along to the kitchen, “there's a way we can escape in there if they get in.” 

We ran into the basement and shut the door behind us, sitting on the top step and listening in case one of those things broke in. It felt like an hour had passed, with the distant sounds of ghoulish wailing and fists banging against the front door aside from our soft breathing. 

I heard footsteps in the kitchen and felt fear shoot through me. “They got in.” I panicked as I stood. The doorknob twisted as someone tried to get through the basement door. “Come on, Yaz!” I grabbed her shoulder, ready to make a break for the crawlspace, then: 

“Dude, Grace, it's me, open the goddamn door.” Vanessa hissed from the other side. 

I unlocked the door to the sight of the blonde alt girl holding the sachet in one hand and pinching her nostrils closed with her other hand. She seemed to be panting, her forehead beaded with perspiration.

“Where's that fucking ghost kid?” She asked, the look on her face making it clear she was fed up. “I had to outrun so many of those things and I got in through the back door but now they're blocking that exit, too.” 

“We'll use the crawlspace,” I took the sachet from her and handed the camera back. “I don't know where William is, but the ouija is down here, so we should be able to call him.”

I led the way back downstairs. After collecting the Ouija board and planchette from where it had been thrown the last time we used it, we set it up in front of the furnace and sat ourselves around it. We didn't have candles but we set up flashlights to illuminate the area again.

 I squeezed Yazmine's hand, noticing the faraway look on her face, “Are you okay?” 

“I just want this to be over.” She replied, shaking her head. 

“Let's get it over with, then,” Vanessa took a deep breath, “is the spirit of-” 

The ragged scream of a woman alongside frantic banging against the basement door resounded throughout the room. 

“Um, Vanessa, did you lock the back door?” I asked slowly. 

Vanessa blinked at me. “Uh-” 

*“GIVE IT BACK!”* The only words I could make out among the wails, whispers, crying, and laughter leaked through the basement door. *“GIVE US OUR EYES BACK!”*

“You didn't!” Spit flew out my mouth as I glared accusingly at Vanessa. 

“Fuck, I'm sorry, I forgot!” Tears ran down her cheeks. 

“We're just lucky they can't go through fucking walls.” I spat, looking down at the board. “Just hurry up and say the words!” 

“Is the spirit of William Crawford present?” The words rushed out of Vanessa's mouth clumsily. “We have something you might want.”  

“There.” Yazmine pointed behind Vanessa, scaring the living daylights out of her as she whirled around and saw the apparition of the brunette little boy peeking around the corner of the entryway to the other room.  

“Here!” Vanessa hastily snatched the sachet from me and raised it to him. He crept forward almost shyly, emerging from the shadow into the flashlight. 

I stood up and grabbed the sachet back, staring at the spirit with a hard look on my face. Vanessa and Yazmine looked at me like I had lost my mind. “Grace, are you an idiot?!” Vanessa demanded to know. 

William reached his white fingers out, his eyeless face contorted into a frozen expression of rage from the moment he appeared. His mouth was open in a way that implied he was yelling, not in fear or pain but anger, and his dark eyebrows were furrowed over his empty sockets. His presence felt like death, as if the Grim Reaper were looking over us, and the edges of his flesh were transparent. He seemed the most inhuman out of every entity we had encountered, his skin so light it was nearly transparent, an intricate spider web of black veins visible all throughout his body. He was more ghost-like even compared to the other kids, he almost seemed like a hologram or an image displayed in front of us by an old school projector. 

“If I give you this,” I began after swallowing the lump in my throat, “you have to let us go, and you have to set free all the souls you've trapped here. They weren't responsible for what happened to you, and what you're doing is very bad.” 

There was silence as William seemed to stare at me with the two dark pools set into his face, no humanity evident in him at all, from the way his body was frozen in the same rigid posture, with his hand reaching, to his face not moving a muscle.  Then, a slow moan, like an injured zombie, croaked from deep within his throat as he was suddenly inches closer to me without ever moving his legs. Still reaching for the sachet. 

“No!” I snapped, lifting it away from him. I could hear Vanessa's labored breathing behind me as she panicked at my rash actions. “You have to promise…pinky promise.” Sticking my pinky out, I tried to appeal to the little kid that was likely still hidden deep within the evil that had corrupted his soul. 

There was another long silence as his head tilted down with him staring unwaveringly at my pinky. Then, the rage filled expression quite literally faded from his face like a PowerPoint transition, into a look of regretful sorrow. His eyebrows were upturned and his mouth shaped into a quivering whimper with wrinkles spread along his chin as if he were about to burst into tears. His hand, without any sort of motion, switched from expectantly awaiting me putting the sachet in his hands to holding his little pinky out. I linked our pinky fingers, and shivered as his flesh felt like touching a hard block of ice. 

Then, I gave him his eyes back. He cradled the sachet in his cupped hands, the same look of silent weeping frozen on his face as he, like all the others, rescinded into the darkness and vanished. His presence departing felt like Armageddon storm clouds withdrawing from the sky and making way for a smiling sun and wispy clouds. The atmosphere seemed lighter. The banging and hollering outside the basement had ceased. 

The three of us hugged, crying in the basement, which now felt safer as it was relieved of that oppressive atmosphere it had before. Instead of escaping via the crawlspace, we walked out the front door. The ghosts from the woods were still out there, but now their backs were facing us and they were calmly walking away, down the street. We were happy to find that John had forgotten his keys in the house when he left earlier, although it was bittersweet knowing we would use his car to get out of this mess without him riding along with us. 

Vanessa, being the only one with the ability to drive out of the three of us, took the driver's seat and inserted the key in the ignition. She placed the camera on the middle console, next to Yazmine who was riding shotgun. I sat in the middle of the back seat and buckled my seatbelt as she made a U-turn and drove slowly out of there. I watched the Eye Ripper house and the unfinished suburb get smaller on the horizon. I also watched the spirits leaving with us, and among them was John, Bryce, and Zack. Vanessa cried softly as we passed them, sniffing snot back up her nose and wiping her face. I felt numb and simply observed them as we passed, same as Yazmine. The ghosts didn't have their eyes back but I wasn't too concerned. I assumed that if they were walking out of this place without attacking anyone, then they were free. William had honored my request. 

The sun was rising, finally. The peachy light of dawn entered the car as we drove along the road flanked by trees. I rolled down the window a bit and heard birdsong, and a bug smacked against the windshield. The critters were back. 

“That place…” I said. “I think it was another realm.” 

Vanessa nodded. “Yeah, that explains why nothing living was there, and why none of those missing people's cars were found. That car graveyard in the woods was so creepy. It's so creepy that they hid evidence of people being there. Now that I think about it, all that stuff people left behind must've appeared after we entered the realm. When we left the basement it seemed like less stuff was in there. At first I thought we entered the realm when we did the Ouija board thing, but then I got to thinking, it must've happened as soon as we stepped foot in that basement. The basement was basically a gateway and…” 

Her rambling became white noise as I looked out the window, reflecting on everything and being so relieved I was finally going home. 

Then I looked at Yazmine's window and my heart stopped.  

She was looking almost wistfully out the window as well, and thanks to the light of daybreak I could see her reflection in the glass. 

Her reflection was eyeless. 

Immediately, it felt like the air was short and it was impossible to breathe. 

*No… No, no, NO. Not her too. Anyone but her.*

I closed my eyes and rubbed them vigorously, hoping it was a hallucination brought on by stress and trauma. When I opened them again, Yazmine was peering around the head rest of her car seat, looking straight at me. 

“Grace.” She said as I flinched. “I don't feel very well at all… I think maybe we should stop for a moment.” 

Vanessa frowned as I felt the entire world crumble around me with the realization we were going home with an entity in our car. “What? No, Yazzy, I wanna go home. You'll feel better when we get there.” 

My mouth opened and closed, I looked like a fish gasping for air. My brain faltered as I searched for the words I needed to say amid the wave of dread that washed over me like a tsunami. 

Yazmine stared at Vanessa, her expression blank. Vanessa noticed and gave her a weird look, “What's the matter with you?” 

“I just feel so empty.” Yazmine replied as she looked away. 

“V-Vanessa,” I said shakily, “maybe you should pull over for just a second. I-I think I'm about to puke.” I knew what I wanted to do at that moment, once we stopped I was gonna convince everyone to get out of the car and then find a way for Vanessa and I to get in without Yazmine, lock the doors, and get the hell out of dodge. Just like I did with Zack and Bryce. 

Vanessa groaned, beyond agitated at our insistence to delay our arrival home after the hell we've been through. “Look, I don't want to stop until we get to town. We're just a few minutes away now. I'm not stopping in these creepy ass woods.” 

I mentally cursed her stubbornness and looked at Yazmine's reflection in the window again, still eyeless. An idea came to mind… She may have been dead, but she was still my friend, and after all William had stopped the curse, hadn't he? What if I could convince her to get out of the car and go to the other side or wherever all those spirits were headed when we left? Would she panic, realizing she wasn't alive, or would she refuse out of sheer denial at her fate? I tried to put myself in her shoes, and I thought that I would deny it too, demanding to be taken home to my parents. 

Or maybe… just maybe… she would disappear when we got home. Yeah! Ghosts had unfinished business, and maybe she was so set on getting home she didn't even realize what happened to her. Maybe once we got back, and she saw her family, she would disappear. 

So I waited. I stupidly waited, keeping the awful truth to myself as I stewed in my anxiety. But then… 

“Oh my God.” Yazmine inhaled suddenly. “I can't take it anymore. It fucking hurts.” 

“What hurts?” Vanessa shot her a concerned glance but kept her eyes on the road. I mentally begged for her to realize what was going on. “Did you get injured?”

Yazmine inhaled again, a sharp intake of breath. She put her fingers in front of her mouth and inhaled once more, this time it sounded more strained, gravelly and rough. “...My breathing is funny. It's like I have to force it.” 

Then, finally, she looked at her own reflection, and saw what I saw. She stared for a good long while before she reacted, and I could practically see the cogs turning in her brain. But instead of screaming or crying, she grinned as if someone had told the funniest joke of the century, and exploded into hysterics. She had completely lost it. 

Vanessa faced her, having had enough. “Okay, what the hell is going-” 

It all happened so quickly.  

Yazmine went from looking out the window one second to sinking all her fingers deep into Vanessa's eye sockets the next. Agonized screams spilled from Vanessa's mouth, colliding and harmonizing with my own terrified shrieks. The car swerved off the road as her hands shot up to her face, but it was too late, my best friend had ripped her eyes right from her sockets before she could even defend herself. A spray of blood coated the windshield as Vanessa screamed and writhed and thrashed and flailed. all the while, Yazmine sat back in her seat and giggled maniacally, turning the fleshy globes over in her hands and admiring them like they were prized marbles.

I was so focused on watching the grisly scene that I didn't notice we were hurtling towards a tree. 

The hood of the car crashed into the trunk, crumpling so easily like paper wrinkling. I was thrown forward violently, as were they. Spider web cracks rippled throughout the windshield. Vanessa clumsily opened the driver's side door and fell out onto the ground, scrambling blindly. 

“Grace! Help!” I could make out these words in between her string of pained and petrified babbling and spluttering.  

“Look what I won.” My friend said in a boastful voice, bringing my attention from Vanessa's agonizing last moments back to her. 

Yazmine looked over her seat at me, showing me Vanessa's bloodied gray eyes, a chord of red flesh still hanging from them.  She smiled, and I realized that her physical appearance now matched her reflection. 

I screamed and threw myself out of the car, fleeing for the road and once I got there I was determined to run all the way back home. I left Vanessa behind, not only was I beyond scared for my life but also I knew she would not last long with her eyes being ripped so violently from her skull like that. I was completely aware she had a few minutes at best. 

As I ran, I made the mistake of looking behind me. The ghost of Yazmine stumbled from the trees and onto the road, sadly looking after me. “Grace?” She called out to me unsurely, as if I was the one acting different. She sounded scared and confused. 

I couldn't help it. I stopped and turned to face her. She was far enough where her empty eye sockets looked like black pinpoints.

“Why?” I wheezed out between panting breaths. “Why did you do that to her? You're supposed to move on, like the others!” I felt my grief trace wet trails down my flushed cheeks. 

“Move on?” Yazmine questioned as she steadily walked forward, her brow furrowing. She then smiled and slowly shook her head. “Oh. Oh, no, Grace. There's no moving on.”

“Then where are the other ones going?” I challenged her, taking a step back with every step she took forward. “Everyone that was killed in that place was set free. So…so why are you different?!” 

Yazmine smiled, sadly this time. “Why did you abandon me, Grace? I thought we were friends.” Suddenly, she was a few feet closer. She had teleported. 

“Stay back.” I warned, my breath hitching.  

“These don't work.” Yazmine raised her hand and dropped Vanessa's  eyes on the ground. “I can't believe it… My best friend left me.” She teleported another five feet closer and I gasped. 

“We're still friends.” I assured her, desperately. 

“If we're friends…” She became still, and her arms slowly rose, her fingers wiggling as they stretched towards me, as if she was beckoning for a hug. *“You can share your eyes with me.”*

Her jaw unhinged, stretching her mouth into an oblong shape, and a croaking growl rasped from her throat as she suddenly glided forward without moving her feet, as if on ice.  The groan coming out of her mouth sounded like a man with tuberculosis fighting for his last breath on his death bed while simultaneously turning into a bloodthirsty zombie. 

I turned and ran the longest I'd ever run, that was the most scared I'd ever been in my life. Before, I had people to run with, friends, allies who would help protect me. But right then, I realized that I had absolutely no one left. No one to hold my hand as we fled, no one to sacrifice themselves for my survival. 

I seemed to run for hours, looking over my shoulder occasionally to see her chasing me. She wasn't running, she was like a still image of herself, standing rigidly with her arms reaching and her mouth forming a silent scream, teleporting ever closer in a soundless pursuit. She had lost all traces of humanity. She was no longer the girl I had become friends with, she was infected by an insidious curse I thought we had vanquished. 

I've never run so fast my entire life, for so long. I kept going and going, my legs and arms pumping, my mouth gasping for oxygen, my lungs feeling like shriveled raisins. There were times I felt her fingertips graze my back, and I propelled myself forward, pushing myself to my limits until I felt I would collapse. In an attempt to break from her line of sight I lurched into the forest and stayed close to the road. I navigated the maze of trees until they started to thin out, making way for the town's first few buildings that greeted you when you entered. 

I looked back one last time to see her standing several yards away from me, her mouth hanging  open wider with her chin nearly reaching her chest as if furious at my escape. I ran across the street into a 24 hour laundromat which was pretty much empty aside from an old man asleep at the desk. I sat down and caught my breath, listening to old fashioned music from the speakers fixed to the ceiling and trembling from head to toe. I felt like I had just escaped a fate worse than death, like I had just evaded the depths of Hell with Satan hot on my heels the entire way.

I couldn't believe I made it, all I could do for a while was sit and sob. Out of six people, I was the only survivor.

So, there you have it. 

I already know what you're thinking, and no, I did not go to the authorities about this at all. The proof, the camera, was left in John's car, and I was damned if I would go back for that stupid device and risk my eyes getting evicted from my skull. I also knew how it may look, I mean, if the Eye Ripper’s death looked like suicide to the police, then that supported my suspicion that those eyeless wraiths don't leave proof like fingerprints or hairs behind. If I were to tell them that Yazmine murdered Vanessa, what if they investigated and found no evidence of Yazmine doing that? I'm sure they'd find evidence she was in the car, but being in the car didn't mean she did it, neither did her being missing (and I'm sure she would not appear to them as a wraith), they could easily say I killed both of them and they just haven't been able to find Yaz’s body. 

I may have been paranoid, I don't know, I used to watch crime shows sometimes with my mom, and it amazed me how many little ways they could nail a person for murder. I wasn't about to go to the cops when I had no idea how to explain anything, and I was so afraid. 

I returned home, thankful my parents were out for their anniversary plans. On the way back, I had concocted an alibi for when the police eventually came investigating the disappearance of my friends. I was going to tell them that I had decided last minute not to go to Zack's sleepover party, and they told me that they were going to the abandoned suburb.

I stuck to this story, and when people went to investigate, they found the remains of many people in those woods, clearly deteriorated for some time but appearing seemingly overnight, including the carcasses of my friends hanging limply from the trees. All with their eyes torn out. They found the cars and belongings left behind too. They said it was a serial killer trying to copy the Eye Ripper case, making people go missing, and that he was still on the loose. Thank God they didn't look for evidence of me being there, my nerdy goody two shoes looks made people automatically trust my integrity. 

I was glad I wasn't a suspect at any point during the investigation, but I guess they figured a teenage girl who hardly left the house (which my parents would attest to) couldn't kill that many people anyway so they ruled me out despite being the last person to see my friends alive.  

I had saved myself from a lifetime of people thinking I was crazy for raving about eyeless ghosts. I know how it goes in the movies, without proof they never believe the lone survivor. And why would they? After all, I had been a skeptic too, and if I was on the other end, I wouldn't believe me either. I just had to endure being forced into regular therapy sessions, the constant stream of pity from my classmates who now felt obligated to hang out with me, and, of course, the overwhelming loss of my friends. 

I can never rest easy. I plan to leave the country for college and go to Japan or something. It's just, I keep thinking about what I have done. I set them free by asking the boy who started the curse, but that didn't actually fix the problem, that just unleashed a plague of eyeless wraiths outside the prison cell of a realm they had been in and onto the mortal world. I keep googling eyeless murders and more homicide cases pop up over the course of months, spreading across the state and through the country, but then proof of them slowly are scrubbed off the internet. The articles just disappear soon after being posted, leaving forums of people who noticed this phenomenon and wanted to discuss it and share their conspiracy theories. 

The more superstitious ones think it's demons  or aliens. The others think it's multiple Eye Ripper copycats, a cult of them even, because it was clear one person wasn't doing this. They are ripping out eyes insatiably, and among these soulless killers are the restless and tormented spirits of my friends. 

I lay awake at night, knowing that when I close my eyes I'll be haunted by their eyeless faces. I just fear the day I encounter one of them again, and they will force me to join their ranks as they force the eyes out of my skull.
