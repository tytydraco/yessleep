I’ve had this friend for a long time, since childhood, and recently, she broke up with her boyfriend. Or I should say — she was dumped. And when did this happen? Well, right before halloween. Usually on the 31st I like to curl up with a big bucket of candy, wearing my comfiest PJ’s and hanging out with a good (sometimes scary) movie. But this year, I knew I had to support my friend. So when she wanted to go out to a party in a neighborhood near my place, I figured there was nothing for me to do except say yes.   
I didn’t have much in the way of a costume… so I dug up a pair of my favorite black jeans and put on a black top. That was scary enough for me. The party wasn’t supposed to start until 10, but my friend texted me right at 8 that she was at the party, and that I should just come by early. I groaned mentally, but I knew she needed someone to talk to and confide in besides that d-bag who cheated on her. So I put on my boots and head over.   
 Immediately when I get there there’s a weird vibe. I made a bee-line for the snacks and looked around, but I couldn’t see my friend anywhere. In fact, the party was basically empty. There were only a few people in some costumes that looked straight up weird. I was expecting Superman or Starwars. Instead I saw people in long black robes, and dark, red looking eyes. I figured it was an inside joke or maybe a movie that had come out, that I hadn’t seen yet. Anyway, I chalked it up to not going out that much.   
It felt like an hour had passed, but finally I heard my friend. I looked around but besides the people in weird costumes I couldn’t se her at all. Even so, I figured I should go and try to find her.   
Another weird thing about this party, was the really old tree in the yard. I couldn’t figure out what it was, but I’ll just say it didn’t look normal. It was really big, and clearly had been around for a long time, despite this being a relatively new neighborhood. The leaves also looked dark, and the trunk was mangled, like it had been messed with somehow.   
I could tell my friend’s voice was coming from somewhere behind that tree, so I started walking towards it.. I heard my friend and she sounded like she was right next to me. I figured it was just dark… but why couldn’t I see her at all?   
Then, things went from strange to downright bizarre.   
The next thing I know, I saw my friend. But there wasn’t anyone around, so I don’t know who she could have been talking to.   
I tried to ask, but she started hugging me instead, and told me how happy she was that I was here on her journey with her. It was only later, that I started to question what that meant.   
She seemed like she wanted to say something else. She had a scared, afraid expression on her face, and she started tugging on my sleeve.  
That’s when a random guy came over and said hi. He wasn’t dressed like the others. He had a normal, Luigi costume on.  
What’s up, Becky, he said to my friend (her name is Becky). Her stone cold expression turned into a smile.  
Hey, she said.   
Want me to take your picture, he said, pulling out a camera.He took a picture on his old-school, polaroid camera. But just then, someone came over.   
Here, he said, handing me the photo.   
When I turned back, Becky was gone.  
I chalked the whole thing up to it being a weird night, and then I went home. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. I was feeling pretty tired by then. And honestly, I was a little freaked.   
It wasn’t until this morning that I dug out the photo from my bag. I couldn’t believe what I saw….   


should I go to the police? I haven't heard from my friend since last night...
