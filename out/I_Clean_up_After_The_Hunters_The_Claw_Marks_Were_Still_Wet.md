I’m typing this from the cab of my beat-up F-150, parked in a McDonald’s lot off I-90 in Chicago. The motor’s idling to keep the heat on, a low rumble vibrating the cracked vinyl seats. My right arm’s wrapped in a greasy rag from the glove box. Four claw marks, deep enough to scrape bone, ooze red down my sleeve and sting like hell every time I flex. The blood’s soaked through, dripping slowly onto my jeans, pooling in the creases of the fabric. My hands shake and smear crimson across the laptop keys. It’s 3 a.m., and I can still hear it. That wet snarl echoes in my skull like it’s carved there, a loop I can’t shake.

 I clean up after Vanguard Extermination’s hunters. Tonight was my first job. I don’t know what I’ve gotten myself into. If you’ve worked for them or seen what they hunt, tell me what’s coming. I’m not sure I’ll make it to the next gig.

I started with Vanguard two weeks ago. It’s a cash gig with no résumé needed, just a phone call that came out of nowhere last Tuesday. A voice, clipped and gravelly, asked, “Can you handle a mess?” I said yeah. I used to mop floors at a slaughterhouse in Gary, Indiana—blood, shit, and gristle sliding under my boots for eight bucks an hour—so I figured I could stomach whatever they threw at me. They didn’t ask for references or ID, just dropped a grand in my account through some encrypted app and told me to wait for a text. I spent the next few days pacing my one-room apartment, the walls yellowed from years of cigarette smoke, the radiator clanking like a dying engine. Tonight, 8 p.m., the text buzzed my cracked Nokia: “Warehouse, 2300 S. Halsted. Shredder cleanup. Hunters done. Bring bleach.” I grabbed my kit from the closet—a mop with a splintered handle, two dented steel buckets, rubber gloves stiff from old grease, and a crowbar, rusted but heavy, for prying guts off concrete. I drove over in the dark, windshield fogging from my breath, tires crunching snow in the empty lot.

  
The warehouse loomed against the sodium-lit sky, a hulking shell of crumbling brick and smashed windows, jagged glass teeth glinting in the cold. The air hit me as I stepped out—sharp, 15 degrees, stinking of rust and something sour, like meat left to rot in a dumpster. A Vanguard van sat out front, black with no plates, doors ajar, engine cold. No hunters in sight—just tire tracks cutting through the slush, fading into the night. I assumed “done” meant done, so I hauled my gear inside, buckets clanking against my thighs, the crowbar swinging loose in my grip. The steel door creaked open, hinges groaning, and I stepped into a slaughter pen.

The floor was cracked concrete, slick with red, running ankle-deep in blood that lapped at my boots, thick and clotting slow. Claw marks gouged the surface—six inches deep, ragged like a machine had raged through, stretching wall to wall in a frenzy of slashes. The walls sprayed crimson, streaked with handprints—or claw prints—smearing down to the floor, where chunks of flesh stuck wet and glistened under my flashlight’s beam, dripping slowly onto the concrete with a soft plop-plop. A hunter’s boot sat by a splintered crate, laces frayed, toe gnawed down to shredded rubber, blood pooling warm around the sole. I gagged, the bile rising sharp in my throat, and pulled on my mask—rubber, cracked from those slaughterhouse days, the straps biting into my scalp. I started scrubbing, bleach sloshing from the bucket, the sharp fumes burning my nose and mixing with the rot-stink until my eyes watered. The air buzzed, thick and heavy, like flies should’ve been swarming but weren’t—just an eerie silence broken by the drip-drip of gore from a busted pipe overhead, rust flakes floating down like ash.

I worked slow, mop dragging through the blood, soaking red before the bleach could cut it. The claw marks caught my eye—too fresh, edges glistening like they’d been carved minutes ago. I found teeth scattered near a steel beam—yellow, jagged, wolf-sized, some snapped at the root, others whole and sharp enough to slice skin. The beam was bent, twisted like taffy, and I pried the teeth out with the crowbar, metal screeching loud enough to echo through the cavernous space. My hands grew slick with sweat inside the gloves, the rubber sticking to my palms, and I wiped my brow, leaving a streak of grime across my forehead. Every scrape of the mop, every clank of the bucket, felt too loud—like I was waking something I shouldn’t.

That’s when I saw him, the last hunter slumped in the corner, face down in a puddle of his own guts. His chest was caved, ribs snapped outward like broken twigs, lungs shredded into pink tatters, blood bubbling slowly around the edges as if he’d just stopped breathing. One arm dangled, claw-torn from shoulder to wrist, muscle peeled back in strips, the other clutched a machete—blade chipped, coated black with something thicker than blood, viscous and tar-like. His eyes were gone, gouged out clean, sockets dripping red jelly that trickled down his cheeks, pooling with the blood below. His jaw hung loose, unhinged at one side, tongue lolling out, purple and swollen. I froze, mop slipping from my grip to splash bleach across the floor, the white foam fizzing pink where it hit the gore. He twitched—fingers curling, slow and deliberate, a rasp gurgling up from his throat: “It’s not dead.” My gut dropped hard. Vanguard said “done,” and hunters don’t lie—or so I thought. His head jerked up, blind sockets staring straight at me, and the voice rasped again, wetter, not his own: “Clean me again.”

I stumbled back, boots slipping on the slick concrete, my flashlight clattering against a crate and spinning wild, shadows dancing across the blood-streaked walls. The claw marks moved—concrete cracking, shifting slow, like something scratched from underneath, a low rumble vibrating up through my soles. A snarl rolled through the warehouse—deep, guttural, shaking the floor so hard the buckets tipped, bleach spilling in waves. The puddle under the hunter rippled, blood bubbling fast, frothing red at the edges. I grabbed the crowbar, cold and heavy in my hands, and swung it at the air, heart slamming against my ribs, breath ragged in my mask. The wall exploded—bricks blasting inward, pelting my legs with sharp chunks, dust choking my lungs until I coughed blood-flecked spit. It was the shredder—10 feet tall, gray fur matted with black blood, claws like butcher knives dripping red onto the floor. Its jaw unhinged, teeth a jagged mess of yellow and cracked enamel, saliva stringing thick between them. Eyes glowed piss-yellow, pupils slitted, locked on me like I was meat. Vanguard lied. It wasn’t dead, just pissed and starving.

The hunter’s corpse lurched up—puppeted, guts trailing in wet loops—and swung the machete, blade slashing an inch from my throat, the air hissing as it passed. I ducked, crowbar cracking his skull—bone splintering with a wet crunch, brains splashing gray and red across my boots—but the shredder roared and lunged, claws raking my arm. Skin tore open, muscle split wide, blood jetted hot down my side, soaking my shirt in seconds. I fell, bleach bucket tipping fully, the flood washing over my knees, fumes stinging my eyes until I blinked tears. It swiped again—missed my chest, gouged the floor instead, sparks flying as concrete shattered. Sirens wailed outside, red and blue flashing through the broken windows—three cops burst in, Glocks popping loud, brass shells clinking on the bloody floor. Bullets sank into its hide, useless, black ooze leaking slow from the holes, pooling thick. It turned, fast as a whip—first cop’s chest burst open, ribs snapping like dry wood, guts hosing the crates in a crimson arc; second’s head bit clean off, teeth crunching through bone, blood arcing high to splatter the ceiling; third screamed, claw punching through his gut, intestines spilling out in a wet tangle, legs kicking wildly as it lifted him, shook him like a rag doll, and dropped him pulped, a heap of meat and uniform.

I scrambled. Boots slipped, crowbar swinging, hit its leg. Iron sank, ooze spurted, but it laughed, a wet snarl rattling my skull, and lunged. Teeth grazed my shoulder, spit burning like acid. Headlights flashed. The Vanguard van screeched in, hunters piling out, rifles blazing. Cracks loud as thunder, rounds tore fur, flesh flying. It roared, claw slashing, caught a hunter’s arm and tore it free, bone snapping, blood raining. Another’s gut opened, intestines looping out and steaming in the cold. I dove behind a crate. Splinters cut my palms, bleach soaked my jeans. They pinned it, rifles popping, a net gun firing. Steel cords tangled its claws and pinned it thrashing. One hunter, big and scarred, jammed a harpoon in its throat. Black blood gushed and soaked him. It slumped, concrete cracking under its weight, yellow eyes dimming slow.

They didn’t look at me. They just dragged it to the van, chains clanking and blood trailing, and peeled out, tires squealing. I limped up, arm throbbing and shirt red, and mopped what I could. Guts sloshed, claw marks still wet. I grabbed the hunter’s machete, chipped and heavy, for proof. Cops lay shredded, chests hollow, heads gone, guts strewn like confetti. That voice stuck, “Clean me again,” looping soft and wet in my head, nose trickling blood I didn’t feel. I’m here now, parked, rag tight around my arm. Four gashes, deep, black at the edges, sting worse every minute. Vanguard texted, “Next job Monday. Keep quiet,” with another grand in my account. I hear it, snarling, faint, under the engine’s hum.

First night’s a bitch. What’s Vanguard hunting? What’s this voice? Tell me. I’m not sure I can scrub this clean, But they better pay for my medical bills.
