We weren’t supposed to leave the town. Ever.

The adults said it was to protect us from the monsters outside—the things lurking in the shadows of the Forbidden Woods. It was a rule everyone followed, even though none of us had seen these so-called monsters ourselves.

But there was another rule everyone followed, one that made my skin crawl: **you don’t ask about the missing kids.**

It started with the runaways and the homeless—the ones nobody really cared about. They’d disappear, and people would mutter things like, *They probably moved on to the next town,* or, *Good riddance.* But then it got worse.

Two weeks ago, the girl I liked, Emily, went missing. She wasn’t homeless or forgotten. She was kind, funny, and way too smart to just vanish. When I asked around, the adults gave me the same blank stares, like her name didn’t mean anything.

Except for my friends, nobody seemed to care.

That’s how we ended up sneaking out to the Forbidden Woods last night. Me, Jason, Tyler, and Lily—all thirteen, all stupid enough to think we could solve the mystery ourselves.

We left after midnight, armed with flashlights and Jason’s dad’s old hunting knife. The woods were darker than I’d ever imagined. The trees stretched high, their twisted branches clawing at the moonlight. The deeper we went, the more the air seemed to hum with something… wrong.

We found the first one about an hour in.

It was hanging in a web—something massive, spanning the trees like a sick parody of a hammock. At first, I thought it was an animal. But as we got closer, I realized it was a *person.*

Or at least, it used to be.

Its body was thin, unnaturally stretched, like its bones had been snapped and reassembled by someone who didn’t know what a human was supposed to look like. Long, spindly arms with too many joints dangled limply, while legs twisted backward at grotesque angles. Its face was the worst: hollowed-out cheeks, skin stretched taut over a misshapen skull. Its eyes were black pits, but I swear I saw something moving inside them.

Lily screamed, and the thing twitched.

It wasn’t dead.

Its head jerked toward us, moving in short, unnatural bursts. Then its mouth opened, and it *spoke.*

“Help… me…”

The voice was garbled, like it had forgotten how to use words. Jason grabbed Lily and pulled her back, but I couldn’t move. I couldn’t look away.

Then it started crawling.

It moved like a spider, its limbs bending in impossible ways as it scuttled down the web. The sound of its joints cracking made my stomach churn. I finally snapped out of it and bolted, the others right behind me.

We didn’t stop until we found the cabin.

It was an old, rotting thing, hidden in the thickest part of the woods. But the light spilling from the windows was modern—bright, sterile, unnatural.

Inside, we saw everything.

Cages lined the walls, each one crammed with kids and teens. Some were unconscious. Others were screaming, banging on the bars until their hands bled. And in the middle of it all was a machine—a massive, metal contraption covered in tubes and needles.

I recognized Emily immediately.

She was strapped to the machine, her face pale and streaked with tears. But it wasn’t just her anymore. Her arms were wrong—elongated and segmented, with sharp, black claws where her fingers should have been. Her legs were bent, her skin covered in patches of something hard and glossy, like an insect’s shell.

Her eyes met mine, and she whispered, **"Run."**

But I couldn’t.

Behind the machine, a group of adults sat watching, their faces illuminated by monitors displaying everything happening inside the cabin. They were dressed too well to be from our town—suits, jewelry, expensive watches. One of them leaned forward, sipping champagne as Emily screamed in agony.

I recognized him from the newspapers. He was a politician from the neighboring city.

Jason tugged on my arm. **“We need to go, now!”**

But Emily let out a sound—half scream, half chittering—and it froze me in place. Her transformation was accelerating, the hard plates spreading across her body, her screams becoming inhuman clicks and hisses.

The people behind the monitors were laughing.

Jason yanked me hard, and I stumbled back. The last thing I saw before we ran was Emily’s head snapping toward the adults, her mouth splitting open to reveal jagged mandibles.

And then the lights went out.

We made it back to town just before sunrise. Jason and Lily wanted to tell someone—anyone—what we’d seen. But who would believe us? The town didn’t care about the missing kids.

I don’t know what happened to Emily after we ran. I don’t want to know.

But every night since, I’ve heard the sound of skittering outside my window.

And sometimes, I hear her voice.

**"Run."**
