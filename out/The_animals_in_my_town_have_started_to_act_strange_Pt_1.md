I'm not quite sure what I'll get from posting my experience on this but considering that anyone I ask around here immediately brushes me off anytime I mention these experiences I feel as though I have no one else to come to with the crazy shit that's been going on.


I live in a fairly normal town which, for security reasons, I will not be mentioning the name of however I will state that it's in the southern parts of the United States. Parts around here range between the sparsely populated outside of town consisting of forests and plots of land on which the farms are based, and the town with the main schools and businesses. This town doesn't have too small a population but it's definitely not a big one either with only around 3,000-4,000 residents.


My family and I live between the rural outskirts and the town center having a bit of both when it comes to the nature side of things, the large forested areas being only a short walk away. In these forested areas, my small neighborhood has a series of long intersecting trails that I'd often use for walks and biking. 


It all began with the birds. About a month ago I went on one of my normal bike rides through the paths, a nice audiobook plugged into my ears and the wind on my face, one of the only exercises that I actually enjoy. After I left my house everything was normal, I rode for about half an hour before stopping at one of the park areas within the trails to take a breather.


I was checking my phone when out of the corner of my eye I saw something strange, there was a crow perched on the wall of the public bathroom a few feet away from me just staring. I put my phone down and looked back at it slowly, trying not to scare it away. I thought it was strange but cool how friendly the bird seemed, I assumed that it probably associated me with someone who fed the birds here before. The crow was abnormally still, sort of like a statue, with not even a twitch or flutter of movement, even when I moved closer it kept still only slightly turning its head to stare at me.


That was when the second one came flying in and landing directly behind the first, and once it landed it adjusted itself and became just as still matching the other crow's movements from its place in line. Then came another, and another, and another all forming a straight line across the wall. At this point I was stepping back, this interaction was more than strange enough for me to decide that it was best I leave.


However, when I stepped up to my bike preparing to take off I was suddenly startled by a thump of flesh on the concrete behind me. I turned around to see the first crow's body sitting lifeless on the ground, then came another one, stepping off the platform and falling straight to the ground. It made no attempt to flap its wings or fly, its only movements were from its eyes being continuously trained on me.


One after the other the crows each followed the one in front of them, stepping forward and waiting for their turn to take the plunge with birds flying in to replace the back of the line like some sort of sick follow the leader. For a second I stood frozen in a mix of shock and confusion staring at the sight as the pile of lifeless birds accumulated beneath the line. It was then my conscience finally stepped in and said 'fuck this' and flight kicked in as I hopped up onto my bike and hightailed it home. 


If it wasn't weird enough of a day something strange also happened to me when I went to bed for the night. I went to bed normally, trying to forget the events of the day. I have trouble getting to sleep even on good nights, but even more so when the images of the lifeless crow pile on the ground wouldn't stop flashing through my head. 


Now I must preface this by saying that I am very used to having nightmares and sleep disturbances and will occasionally wake up talking, yelling, or crying from some of my dreams. It's honestly more abnormal for me to have a good dream than a bad one and even my subconscious has gotten used to this with most of the bad dreams only mildly affecting me. Don't know if it has something to do with my past and I'd rather not talk about it if I don't have to, but I've only ever had two real night terrors where I woke up screaming. The terror I felt in the abject horror of those nightmares was wildly different from what I was to experience that night, but while that extreme fear was the same, the dream carried with it a severely ominous tone that I had not yet experienced before.


When I finally fell asleep I found my conscience flying through the air and the forest below me. That was when a nagging feeling came to me and a voice spoke in my ears. Its voice was cut up as if it was paused in intervals, running out of air before it could speak more than a word. It spoke in a mix of English and a language I didn't understand so I'll do my best to go off the sounds, "Up. Come. Converge. Testis. demonstra." As it said these words my sight began to move faster through the trees until it came upon white brick and landed.


All I could see was a black plume of feathers in front of me. Then the voice came to me again this time with a lot more to say it seemed, but also much more of the unintelligible language. "Here. Qi. Vide. Awoken. No. Sit. Frustra. Sacrifichim.". That was when I realized that I was walking forward and the feathers in front of me disappeared downward. 


What I saw as I stepped up in his place could only be described as damnation. I looked down at the red mist of flesh expecting to see feathers, but all I could see were the limbs and contorted bodies of men whose arms, legs, torsos, and even heads were all facing different directions. And it was my turn to join them, my body moved without my permission stepping one foot forward and off the cliff. As I plummeted towards the writhing mass of agonized souls, I tried my hardest to flap around my hands praying that they would let me fly, however, when I looked towards myself they clung firmly at my sides as if they accepted my fate before I had.


That was when I woke up to my mother shaking me yelling to wake up, and when I did I shouted at her "Mom Stop, I'm awake!" and she finally put me down and that was when I saw her crying. "Are you ok? You scared the shit out of me." She said exasperated, "Yeah I'm ok, what happened? Are you ok?" I said jumping out of bed. "You were screaming bloody murder, what is wrong with you?" She said concerned with a slight bit of anger in her shaky voice. 


"I'm fine, it was just a bad dream. I'm ok, I promise." I said all this without being sure of it myself. "You better be, don't scare me like that again. Tell me if anything is going on. Ok?". I debated telling her about the birds, but decided it was better not to because who would believe something like that? She would probably just assume it was only a dream. "Ok, just go back to bed please, I promise I'm alright. Love you." I said as I picked up my blanket from the floor and hugged my mother, "Love you too, goodnight." She said as she slowly walked out of my room, giving me one last concerned look before closing the door behind her. I didn't get much sleep after that.


That leaves me here, I have a few more instances that I want to write about, but I've been pretty busy and don't have the time to type everything out at this moment. However, with the rate that these things have been happening as well as their increasing oddity and frequency, I doubt it will be long before I write about some of the other things I've seen in the hope you guys will have some answers to what's been going on. The crows were the least of the horrifying creatures I've seen so far and honestly in comparison are not that bad, I still can't get the picture of the bunny out of my mind, if you could call that thing a bunny. Anyway thanks for reading my post, I'm going to try and stay busy and away from this mess to the best of my ability.
