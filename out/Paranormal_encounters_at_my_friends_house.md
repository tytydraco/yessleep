I have a friend who claims that his house is haunted. At this point, I actually think it is, because I've had a few paranormal encounters and my friend has also said some paranormal stuff that apparently happened to them in their house. Here are some of them. (These encounters are linked together because they all are related to paranormal encounters and happened at my friend's house)  


1. Jarred - On my phone I have a "ghost detector" app which apparently can detect ghosts by reading magnetic fields. It's quite convincing if you use it and it has a word generator which generates words from the readings to give the user an idea of what the ghost is saying and if it's actually there. Well, I tested this app at my friend's house and in most of the places, there was no reading. However, in one particular place on the ground, near one of the doors, the magnetic meter went red, as in high, when we put the phone close to the area. The app started generating words and we saw a name in one of the words, Jarred, so we decided to call the "ghost" Jarred. We suspected the ghost was laying on the floor (for some reason) because that's the ONLY place where the meter went up. And to clear stuff up, no there was nothing metallic near there, we tested other places and my friend said there were no pipes or anything underground that would've caused the magnetic meter to go up (and anyway, if there, were, the magnetic meter would've gone high in other places near the ground, too.). The ghost was always there.  

2. Dark figure - There is not much information about this encounter, as I wasn't there to see it. However, my friend had claimed that in the corner of his eye, in the kitchen, he saw a tall black figure, I think a shadow one, just standing there. I am pretty sure there was nothing in there if he searched in the kitchen. But apparently a bag in the kitchen also fell randomly (without any wind or force to push it), however I'm not sure if these two events happened at the same time.  

3. Whisper - My friend's brother claimed that when he was sleeping, at night, he woke up randomly and apparently heard a whisper of a woman talking to him in his ear. I'm not sure HOW this happened but I'm sure he was terrified.  

4. Lights - My friend had once entered the room in which his brother slept in (but not at the same day as the event before) and supposedly the lights just switched on/off (I can't remember). He swore that no one else was in the room and it just happened. That seems quite ghostly to me, if I was there I would've ran out so fast.  

5. TV ghost - Another encounter that my friend claimed happened was when he and his brother were in their living room, when the TV suddenly switched on, even though his brother wasn't doing anything and he wasn't either. He also said that the only way to switch the TV on was from a button or using the TV remote controller. This could've been just a problem with the electricity, and now that I think about it, the event with the lights could've been too. But the rest I can't explain.  

6. Spirits - And the last encounter.. This is the only one I was in other than the one about Jarred the ghost. In this event, we were using a different ghost scanner, and it just went up randomly. We were home alone and suddenly we felt something weird. I don't know how to explain it but it was like a chill down my spine, and a phone randomly started buzzing. We figured someone was calling my friend but we didn't dare go to the phone, because we stood up and backed away. That moment was so scary we were actually scared a ghost was about to get us. In fact, my friend's brother started praying that we were going to be safe. Luckily, nothing happened to us but we were still shocked.  


That's it for now. Thanks for reading, goodbye!
