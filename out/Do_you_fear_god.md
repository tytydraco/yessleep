Fat raindrops smack onto my bedroom window as thunder roared on. I sit comfortably in my cushioned gaming chair, a solo cup filled with Mountain Dew next to me. I took a sip from the cup, then faced my computer screen. The time is 2:57 AM. It was a Saturday night, and I had nothing to do the next day. What should I do? I decided to check my email for the first time in months.

As soon as I clicked on my email, one of the emails caught my eye. The sender was [Anonymous_1248]@gmail.com and the subject line was foreign. It read “Если вы читаете это, ради всего святого, не нажимайте на ссылку. Слишком поздно для меня. БЕГАТЬ!” I dragged my mouse over to it and clicked on the email. Inside was a link. Chat_roulette_fun.com. I thought about it. I have nothing else to do tonight. Is it safe? Ah what the hell. Let's give it a shot! 
 
I clicked on the link. It made me agree to its terms and service, then let me continue. The layout was a black, ripped off version of Omegle. It felt eerie. I pressed the button to start a chat. 

The person's username was praise_the_devil946. The cam was off and it was completely silent.

“Is anyone there?”  I ask, confused. Their camera flickered on. It was a person in a dark hoodie, wearing a WW1 era gas mask. I chuckled.

“Yo, what’s with the mask?” Silence. In the chat box, he answered.

I raised my eyebrows at this. I was genuinely confused. I wasn’t very religious, so I came up with something on the spot.

“Hey man, I don’t believe in a god. If there was one, I probably wouldn’t be scared,” I told him. More silence. “Do you have a mic? Or are you just going to use chat all day?” Silence. I started to realize, from white noise in the background, that he did have a mic, but was silent. All of a sudden the person started moving.

He moved to the side, then stepped backwards. It revealed an identical doppelgänger of me, tied to a chair and gagged. There was fear in the doppelgängers eyes, and it looked like he hadn’t showered or slept in weeks. I could hear him moaning in pain. My eyes widened in fear.

“Yo, What the fuck! If this is a joke, it isn’t funny!” I yelled. I tried to look intimidating, but my voice was cracking, and I was shaking. The person walked back to the computer and typed something again.

Chills went down my spine as I read this. I had a feeling I knew what was coming next. I couldn’t bring myself to talk, so I just shook my head.

The person tilted his head, then walked over to the doppelgänger. He grabbed something from his hoodie. Its blade glowed in the light from the computer screen. It was a long, kitchen knife. The person looked at it, inspecting the blade. My doppelgänger was violently shaking, trying to get himself free. It was too late.

The person plunged the blade into his gut, making a sickening thunk. When he pulled the blade out,  My doppelgänger tried to scream, but he was gagged, and could only cry. Wet crimson spread across his shirt, and the knife carried a bright red glint on it. At the same time, a burning, searing pain came from my abdomen. I doubled over in pain, screaming. I fell off of my chair onto the floor. Panic started to set in, and a cold sweat kicked in. I look down at where the pain originated. Nothing. No blood, bruises, anything to suggest I was hurt. I slowly stood back up. I looked at my computer and yelled.

“What the fuck is wrong with you? How did you do that! Stop!” I started to yell blindly at him, my mind switching between obscenities and reasoning. It just stood there,
 staring at the screen. It never made a single noise. It dropped the knife, but there was no sound of it hitting the floor. It started to type again.

Are you fucking joking? You almost killed someone, maybe me, and you're asking me this? I decided to comply.

“Yes, I do. Please, why are you doing this? Please stop!” This time, the silence was broken.

“I am god!” A dark, powerful voice emanated from my computer, louder than I thought it could. For some reason, in the back of my mind, I had no doubt that this person truly was god. It was an odd feeling, I know I should have felt scared but I felt, secure? Safe? I couldn’t tell. 

It lifted up its gloved hand and slowly took off the gas mask. I couldn’t see his face until it was fully off, but when I did I regretted it. 

Pieces of flesh hung off of its face. It looked like its cheeks were poorly sewn together, and some parts of its face had no skin. Its lips were black and rotten, revealing a row of yellow, decaying teeth. Patches of hair stuck out from random areas. The worst part was the eyes. Or where they used to be.  It’s eyes were sunken in, and it seemed to have two endless voids where it’s eyes should’ve been. 

“Stare into my eyes!” It demanded. I complied, in utter shock. 

I looked in the dark pits he called eyes. All of a sudden I felt drowsy. My eyelids started to droop and I was out in under a minute.

I woke up, gagged and tied to a chair. I looked around. I wasn’t in my house anymore. In fact, I was nowhere. The empty void surrounded me, except for in front of me. A hooded person stood straight, with some sort of light illuminating his front side. It then stepped aside, and I saw a computer screen. I squinted to look at it better, then saw me, in my bedroom horrified, staring back.
