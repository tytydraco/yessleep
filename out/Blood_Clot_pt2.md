I'm out of the bathroom and am back in my car. I’ll pick up where I left off. If you haven't read the first part click [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/QDJdRdbgDF)

Feeling slightly more awake, I changed and disposed of all my used napkins after putting them in a trash bag. I had no idea what to do or think, especially since I had work the next day. Hafiz died to protect me from that demon and it did nothing. I drove into an abandoned parking lot and sobbed. My entire life was falling apart because of a single awful entity. My future now seemed impossible because of a grotesque monster who hated me for putting in effort to live. I couldn't believe what was happening and since my coping skills are admittedly pretty awful, I just distracted myself by finishing my notes. Eating the rest of my cashews and straining my eyes to read the page. I could have driven to the library but I had a limit on gas money. 

I wasn't able to sleep for the rest of the night. The thought of seeing Tolc again plagued my mind every time my body started to rest. Every noise and visual kept me on edge. I prayed constantly, despite wishing I had a more proper environment to do so. That along with remembering the Quran’s words on perseverance kept me sane. When morning came I decided to bite the bullet and buy supplies. Stocking up on gauze and tissues. It was a hard call to make as the money I spent on the supplies was originally designated for food. Sure, not all of my food budget was spent on it but it was just enough to make me doubt my choice.

When I got back to campus I tried to act normal, but everyone could tell something was wrong. The dirty looks I got from classmates were exasperated as they stared at my wrapped hand. Their gaze was never one of sympathy, but disgust. I tried to ignore it but I couldn't help but overhear a girl mutter about how she thought I attacked someone. All the while I bit down on my lip to stifle a whine of pain. The craters in my hand were now inching closer to my knuckles. A palpable sting persisted each minute, bordering on insufferable once the layers of my skin grew flaky. I couldn't take the maddening sensation anymore and excused myself to use the restroom, unwrapping the bandage when I got inside.

“Come on,” I whispered through gritted teeth observing my trembling hand. It looked just as bad as it felt. 

I grabbed some paper towels and patted my wound down. Finally allowing myself to wail in a mix of pain and relief. Making sure the water was cold, I ran my craters under the sink. I shivered from the temperature and recoiled as I rubbed soap over it. Muttering prayers to myself as the chill liquid slid through the cuts. After half a minute I dried it, laid down a layer of paper towels, and laid out my supplies, frantically cutting and applying the gauze. Rushing to pack my things since I still had a class to return to. As I swooped up my scissors, I heard a familiar voice. 

“Woah what’s up with you?” 

Instinctively I pointed the scissors in the direction of the voice. A choice I immediately regretted.

“Hey, don’t point that at me! What’s next you’ll run up with a bomb strapped to your chest.” 

Chris, smiled, acting like his sad excuse for a joke was funny. 

“I’m sorry, you spooked me. I just got done wrapping my hand and used these to cut the bandages.”

I nervously held up my wrapped hand as evidence and he furrowed his brow.

“Yeah, and I’m sure you got that cut from glass and not a blood sacrifice.” 

His words completely perplexed me.

“Wait, what?”

“I know what you’re doing, I learned all about your people.” 

I took a deep breath, dreading the conversation that was about to follow. Of course, the school’s resident racist conspiracy theorist walked in.

“Respectfully, whatever you think is going here isn't what’s happening. I did get it from glass. My hand split open when I was cleaning up a broken vase yesterday.“

I wanted to tell him that whatever hateful trash he was eating up was untrue, but if I even implied that he’d lose it.

“You’re just using my lie! Which I should expect because that book you worship is full of them!”

I sighed, putting my scissors away.

“I don't see it that way but you can say that if you want.”

I internally cringed at being civil with this man who smelled worse than the blood I just rinsed.

“Look, I’ve seen you around and haven’t said anything but I won’t let you bring your hellish beliefs to this campus like this!” 

I averted my eyes and began to walk away.

“Boy, where are you going!” he yelled, pulling me back by my jacket. 

Normally I wouldn’t give much attitude but by this point, I was too tired to keep being so docile. Respect is built into me but there’s still a limit.

“Back to class, to write a research paper you’d never read because it has facts.” I snarled, pushing past him and increasing speed.

“God, you’re delusional, you know that!” he angrily spoke without understanding the irony. 

Luckily he didn't pursue me for the rest of the day, but the interaction stuck in my mind. Once my classes were done, I was feeling pretty exhausted. The deterioration in my hand had subsided but it was still there, and the lack of caffeine didn't help. When I got to my car I cracked open the second to last can of my emergency energy drinks. I had kept them in a lunch pale in the back pocket of my passenger seat for desperate times, this being one of them. I downed it before waking in, quickly fixing my hair as I entered. 

I sat at my desk and checked to make sure the sewing machine was plugged in. Taking a deep breath while reminding myself to stay focused. The first few hours were a blur, I did what I needed to do but the moment I finished a piece it faded from my mind. The only thing I remember being the concerned comments from co-workers about my injury. Sometimes I even forgot what I was doing as I sewed it, needing to check my reference multiple times. Our store is open more than most custom embroidery shops, which is a blessing and a curse. It allows me to get more hours but at the same time, it makes my passion for what I‘m doing diminish. Which I know is what happens when a fun hobby turns into a job, but still. I was starting to get tired of stitching in logos. 

The number of customers slowed, leaving me alone at my desk. Reflecting on not only that day but my life. Tolc’s words reverberated in my mind as I stared at my wrapped hand. All this work and I wasn't satisfied. I felt lucky to be alive and fully acknowledged what little privilege I did have, but I wasn't exactly happy. Things could be worse but it was easy to see the ways they could be a lot better. It took me a long time to accept it but in that moment I did. I wasn’t anywhere close to where I wanted to be. 

”Maybe, he’s right.” I murmured to myself, struggling to keep my head up. I could feel that my body was moments away from a crash. I checked my phone, realizing that we were minutes from closing, and tugged on my hair to wake myself. I cleaned up my workspace, practically hobbling to my car. The cold hit me as soon as I stepped out. My lips quivered as I sat in the driver's seat. That in tandem with my tiredness made me struggle to hold myself together as I drove into a rest stop parking lot. I zipped up my sweatshirt, breathing into my hands, before turning on the heater.

“Wait,” I uttered, realizing that my blanket was in the trunk. Looking out my window I saw hail begin to fall from the sky. 

“Of course,” I groaned, clicking my trunk open and running out. The frigid chunks felt like pebbles getting thrown down on me. I bit my teeth harder with each step, grabbing my blanket before running back in.

Curling up into a ball in my chair with a hefty sigh. I tried to stay up a little longer despite knowing I wouldn't be able to. After ten minutes I found myself slipping from consciousness. My eyelids dropped like the harsh hail from the freezing sky above me. Leaving me lying with the little warmth I had.

“Wow, you look like you haven't felt this shitty in a while, and that’s saying something.” that dreaded voice commented. I had the blanket over my eyes but I could tell he was smiling.

“Whoever told you ducking under the covers would save you from monsters lied.” he chuckled, pulling it off me. Yanking my bandaged hand up to his face.

“It's been a day and you already need gauze? Damn, I forgot how much my bite stings. I haven't done it in a while since I decided to spare your brother from it.” 

“Let me guess I didn't get that treatment because in your opinion I got a chance to get better and he didn't?” 

He nodded, grabbing my blanket and observing the embroidery on it.

“Aw, how cute, did your mom sew you this?” he mocked.

“Partly, every weekend she and I would work one patch together. Hate to break it to you but trying to make fun of me for having good childhood memories isn't that effective.” 

He shrugged, tossing it over his shoulders like a cape. 

“Maybe not, but I know it's making you miss those times.” 

The chill from earlier had started to come back.

“Alright, just get to the point.” I snarled, curling back up. 

He wrapped the blanket around his torso while responding.

“If you haven’t noticed already I’ve been going easy on you today. Just leaving your hand to fester.”

He slumped down sideways, resting his legs on my curled-up knees.

“I’m giving you this break hoping that it's allowing you to reflect on your current life and if it’s worth fighting for.” 

I rolled my eyes.

“You seem to think I’m a lot weaker than I am. I’m not giving up after one day.”

He flashed his horrid grin again, red pupils shining the dark. The lights from the rest stop being the only thing preventing us from being swallowed in black.

“It’s funny, your kind always says the same thing right before the first crack in that armor forms.” 

“My kind?” I sharpened my gaze.

“Yeah. Your kind. I told you last time, I go after a certain type of person, so I get a lot of the same responses. People like you are so predictable, putting up a fight saying that they’ll be able to beat a power like me.” 

He snickered, strangely thick spit seeping between his teeth. 

“The result is always one of two things. One, they kill themselves to escape the pain thinking that their death will somehow matter more than their life. Or two, I break them, assume their place, and make something better with the usable parts of their rubble.” 

At that moment his smile appeared more sinister than it ever had before. His words were so viscerally wrong.

“So, with that being said, which route are you choosing?” 

I slowly sat up, purposely moving my legs last. 

“Neither.”

I swiftly shoved his legs off, almost making him fall over. His smile quickly faded as he was turned on his side. Moving out of the blanket wrap he threw it back at me. 

“Alright, fine, you want to play with fire like that?” he yelled, yanking me by the back of my sweatshirt.

“You are sleeping in a car in 40-something-degree weather, working at a place that’s killing your passion, and SOMEHOW think that existence is worth picking a fight with a demon for!” he growled, letting go of my sweater and grasping my neck. I tried to pull his hands away but I couldn't make a dent in his grip.

“I’ve given you your chance to submit and pass on peacefully, just like I gave you a chance to be something and yet again you failed!” 

I coughed, doing my best to breathe through my nose.

“So prepare yourself for the morning because now I’ll revel like crushing a burnt rodent like you!” 

As oxygen failed to reach my brain, my eyes closed. 

I woke up with a sprain in my neck with my blanket on the other chair. I got out of my car to stretch, the cold air wafting over me. My stomach grumbled as I remembered that I hadn't eaten the night before. I checked for snacks but I was out. I groaned and noticed that my throat was hoarse from earlier. I attempted to speak but could barely get a word out. It worried me but I decided not to focus on it. At this point, I knew I’d probably be late for my first class no matter what so I didn't rush myself. 

I got a bag of dry cereal and started eating it with a plastic spoon on a bench outside. I knew I looked pathetic, but it was hard to care about it with how hungry I was. After a few minutes, I felt an ick in my throat and my ears started ringing. Immediately, I knew what it was. I rushed to my car to put away my food and grab my supplies. Walking back inside the rest stop and into a stall in the bathroom. My eyes stung and my ears throbbed, the feeling of fluid coming up from both palpable. I got on my knees and put sponges in my ears as I started to gag. I closed my eyes as they bled, gore leaking from the folds in my eyelids

My entire body shook as each hole in my face bled. My nose stung like it had been attacked by a bee hive and my mouth tasted like a lump of steel. I did my best to plug it up with tissues but it barely did anything. I flushed the toilet at least five times from all the bloodied tissues and tried to rinse my eyes under the sink. Luckily no one saw me bleeding, but it still added a layer of humiliation anytime someone came in and I had to act like I was okay. I know I probably should have reached out, but I honestly didn't expect anyone to help me.

It’s cynical, I know, but in my experience, most people see someone like me and decide to let me suffer alone. Besides, I already felt vulnerable enough, I didn't need someone else seeing me in that state. Anyway, it continued for about 20 minutes with short breaks between, and as I slumped against this filthy toilet feeling my life force gush out, I thought about how no one would likely ever know why it happened. They’d find the body of this brown man covered in his blood with no idea how he got there. Not like it would probably matter to them. I hate to admit it but Tolc was right in a way. People like me die all the time and no one cares to make a headline about it. 

My reflection stared back at me in the mix of toilet water and blood. Everything looked slightly red and for a moment and I feared I’d lose my sight. Maybe my life isn’t that remarkable but if I died then I’d at least want to be known for my death with the full story included. So once I got my bearings, I started typing the first post. If I wasn’t going to make it I at least wanted someone to know even if they didn’t believe me. I got a lot of horrified looks as I walked out with my face barely rinsed, and a wave of shame clouded me. Each one of their eyes was a needle sewing into my self-consciousness, but I got through it. I changed my clothes, wanting to burn the jeans that I’d spent almost an hour in on that disgusting floor. I drove to the middle of nowhere to set up an inflatable pool I could fill water with, making sure I was far from where people could see me.

Even though it was just as embarrassing as any other time I had to do it, it felt like the best bath in my life. Sure the cost of the gas I had to use and the worry someone would see me raged in the back of my mind, but for once I was able to keep it at bay. I’ve been writing this in my car for the past hour and a half or so. I feel bad about missing classes but I just can't today. Honestly, I’m not even sure how I’ve been able to stay awake. That’s everything that’s happened so far, I'm as okay as I can be right now, but I’m even more hopeless than before.
