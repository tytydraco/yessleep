Was it five or six years ago? I don't remember exactly but my mom must have died around that time, I believe it was maybe from a heart attack or a heart condition but either way it was fast and deadly. The house was in her name but after she died it became mine, I took the opportunity because who wouldn’t want a bigger house? But my dumbassery forgot about costs and having to find a new job and all. I didn't think this through.



I figured I could drive and make it there by 18:00 and maybe have time to eat something at a fast food place by the time I got there, maybe mc donalds or something. I drove behind a bus for a good ten minutes and whenever it reached stoplights it would emit a silent but piercing squeal that felt like slow needles into my ears. I wondered if this was how dogs felt whenever a dog whistle was blown.



I was way off on my guess and was far past 18:00 o’ clock, I got there by 21:00. I found the house waiting patiently and with the windows dark as if it was merely closing its eyes, the walk towards the front door gave me shivers and I couldn’t tell if it was nostalgia or the wind. The night felt oddly silent and the whining porch steps and click of the front door unlocking was louder than it should have been. The darkness hugged me from the cold outside. I groped for the light switch and found it, the hallways gave a paltry yellow glow but the stairs looked as if it led to more darkness. The hallways and living room both had an unpleasant yellow wallpaper and the kitchen the same, the fridge of course had nothing edible and it was too late to order food. That was at least what I told myself so that I wouldn’t beat myself up about not eating anything.



There was only one bed in the whole house and it was in the master bedroom.  My old room from when I was a kid was repurposed into a storage room which felt more like a room to hide away unwanted relics, boxes of newspapers and old letters were pushed to the side and a torn couch chair sat in the corner. I pulled out a sketchbook from one of the piles like Jenga and flipped through it. They were old drawings from when I sat down in recess with my colored pencil set and drew to pass the time. I was never a good artist.



I entered the master bedroom with its plain blue wallpaper and white sheets, my parents never let me sleep with them and I remember getting beat either on the bed or on the floor with a belt that I was allowed to pick. I checked the closest and it showed a lone belt and nothing else. I didn't even feel like undressing when I fell onto that bed and slept.



On the first day I ate nothing for breakfast and went shopping. I brought some microwave dinners and some chips. I wasn't good at cooking either so it wasn't much of a loss anyways; I spent the rest of my day wandering through the house and just scrolling on my phone, I stayed up too late and ate too late so I put off showering to not fuck up my sleep schedule further. When I stared into the bathroom  mirror I saw my smile marks and double chin and decided not to stare at myself further and later went to sleep in a bed that felt a little too hot for this time of the year.



On the second day, I overslept and got a slight headache that pestered me for a few hours. I made the same vow yesterday and chose not to look in the bathroom mirror when I noticed that  I looked pale and that my wrinkles looked darker with a new pair of bags under my eyes. I wandered around town looking for  “For Hire” signs and found none, I couldn’t bother with talking to anyone so I gave up and went home. I tried eating microwave dinners but only ate one bite and threw the rest away and went to bed without brushing my teeth.



On the third day, Nothing happened. I still felt like shit and decided to just take a mental health day but later on was mad at myself because I didn't really do anything to deserve it. I had gotten skinnier and I wouldn’t have noticed if I had skipped today’s shower too. I might’ve been able to see my ribs but again I didn’t let myself see them for the same reason that I didn’t let myself see the bathroom mirror. The bed again felt too hot to sleep in and rolling across two hot sides of the bed felt agonizing.



On the fourth day, I didn't get up, I didn't want to. I could see the light trying to get in through the sides of the curtain but even then I didn’t get up. I felt attached to the bed and felt shitty for it. I passed the time with my phone and it kept me distracted and before I knew it. It was dark outside. I didn't care what time it was, I just tried falling asleep since today felt like a failure and maybe the next one would be better.



On the fifth day, I woke up in the middle of the night with my stomach down. I tried moving but I was stuck again to the bed, I looked to the right of me, of where the window was and saw that the curtains were open a crack. I couldn’t reach my phone so I tried looking upwards at the clock right above the head of the bed, but it was as if my lips and jaw were melted onto the pillow and wouldn’t budge.



I looked back to the window and the crack in the curtains were open wider with light behind them. It was daytime. A pitch black hand poked out from behind the curtains and clutched them as if they were threatening to open them from the other side. The light dimmed and went dark behind the curtains. It had turned to night. Another hand poked out of the other curtain, the night brightened and it turned to daytime. The hands forced the crack of the curtains and light blinded me, It again turned dim and night came.



Two pitch black arms were poking inside through the window, my face and body stayed unmoving. The darkness turned brighter and it switched to daytime. I was again blinded. Sunlight dimmed and darkness came again. A head and a torso joined the arms, crawling out as if it was a Ring movie. I felt my arms and body melting to the bed, into the sheets. Sunlight came and went. The being became a crouched figure, I felt time as it was moving faster and faster. Daylight came and went and the being stood with its knees bent and its head ducking downwards as if it was too big for the room, gazing down at me who couldn’t speak.



At me who couldn't scream with my lips and throat melted together, at me whose eyes were melting out of my skull and with time flicking between daylight and night time. Its arm stretching and reaching towards me, I wanted to close my eyes but my eyelids melted onto me. I felt time faster and faster, I felt time melting me, I felt time aging me, I felt time inching this figure of blackness onto me, the outstretched hand loomed over me and It touched me with its elongated fingers, It touched my melted body. And everything became still.



It was daytime, but it stayed daytime. I wasn't melting, I was whole. Open air stood in the presence of that black being. I gazed again at the window with its curtains drawn again. Its curtains open just a crack. And yet again I laid there, unmoving.
