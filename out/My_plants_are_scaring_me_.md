I was dating this girl for about two months when I found out that her younger brother lived near my apartment. Once, we passed by his place because she wanted to pick up something. As soon as I was inside, I was very impressed by his plants; they were so pretty and well-kept, growing far better than you would expect inside a small flat.

He proceeded to show me his secret: a bottle with some pink liquid inside that he had obtained from a company (a chemical industry). "You can't find it in the market," he said. "It is a special formula that one of the scientists has created."

A couple of weeks later, we passed by his flat again, and he handed me a bottle of the same liquid as a gift. I thought that was very kind—he had remembered my interest. "But you can only use around 10ml of this liquid per week per plant, no more than that," he instructed. I didn’t give it a second thought; he was just making sure I would not overprotect my plants, as this can be as dangerous as neglect.

As soon as I got home, I gave my plants the weekly 10ml dose and waited. One week later, I didn’t see any difference in my plants, so as the impatient person that I am, I gave them 20ml instead of the recommended dose. A couple of days later, and still not seeing any changes, I decided I might as well give them an extra 20ml dose. I guess I thought, worst-case scenario, they would just die and I would buy new plants. Little did I know, there could be an even worse scenario.

That night, when I was half-asleep, I felt something itchy on my feet, but I thought it was my cat Buddles and proceeded to sleep. When I woke up, the room was a lot greener than I remembered. My pothos, which is normally in the living room, had spread around the whole apartment—around the walls, over the furniture, and even in my bed. My alocasia, too, had grown leaves almost the size of the wall. Not knowing what to do, I took a knife, cut off the branches that were overgrown, and put them in trash bags to throw away. I could only think that this liquid was finally taking effect, but not in the way I expected, so I threw it away too.

I work from home, so I paid close attention to my plants during the day, though I didn’t notice any further changes. I checked them again before sleep—again, no difference. But then I woke up around midnight, finding it very difficult to breathe and move around. I found that the plants had grown back, but this time much more. There were leaves and branches in almost every single square meter of the apartment. My poor cat was stuck in a corner, unable to move around. I got so scared that I just grabbed Buddles and made my way through the door, directly to my mom’s flat, from where I am writing this now.

This was yesterday, and this morning, I passed by the building with my mom and noticed the windows were completely covered. The door was also not opening. I had broken up with my girlfriend, so I no longer have her contact, and her brother is not answering the door either. I wish I hadn't thrown away that liquid, so at least I could present it to the police if necessary. I'm not sure how to proceed. I am afraid that these plants will break into my neighbors’ homes and worry about the reaction of my landlord. Any advice would be much appreciated.
