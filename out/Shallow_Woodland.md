My home is a part of your typical rural town that is found in every part of the world. So, there isn’t much to speak about in the first place but with every town there are stories as to why they are there. Mine for instance was to provide larger cities with wood; a lumber town to be precise it thrived on the sale of wood. Like all things in this world eventually things start to slow down and eventually stop. My home is no different as it was nothing special to begin with. So, time passed and the lumber-jacks left the woodlands regrew. The town was forgotten by everyone except for the people that still lived there (Me for example). Well every now and then people move in to find a slow paced place to live, and it doesn’t get any slower then here. Eventually, even those people leave as well, because they typically underestimate how slow everything can get when there is nothing around. For, instance this town really only has two things to do. A.) Hiking through the woodlands. or B.) Play baseball. Nothing much aside from those two activities too do in good old “Ackers”.

Well, the town itself isn’t that bad to live in. The real problem is that it's too quiet. The unnerving type of quiet where if you’re not at the baseball field it’s complete silence. Most people here don’t notice it, because we’ve grown used to it I guess. It was only pointed out to me once when I was young by one of the kids that moved here, and stayed. We were walking home one day, and he just randomly said “ Hey, shawn this town is really quiet isn’t it?” I didn’t think much of it, so I just shrugged my shoulders as we continued on our way home. Back then I didn’t really give much a second though, but what Hunter told me stuck with me. I went on with my day, but what he said kept nagging at me from the back of my head like something was telling me to remember. The problem was that I didn't know what I had forgotten in the first place. At the time it never occurred to me that I could have just asked my parents, or something similar to that. Oh, well that was years ago now; live and learn I guess. we-ell for some of us at least. In hindsight, Hunter and I were pretty stupied to-begin with, so thinking back on this is pretty hysterical in a dark humor kind of way. Shit I lost my train of thought. Hmmm…. ok I remember where I left off. I went to sleep non-stop about what I could have forgotten. Nothing came to mind, so I fell asleep.

So, the following day I asked Hunter what he meant by the town being really quiet. That was a mistake, because boy can he talk an ear off. Well, the long and short of it was that Hunter noticed that the town was eerily quiet, because despite living in a town surrounded by woodland there were never any animal noises. So, after hearing what he had to say I thought about it. There are dogs and cats here, but none of them make any noise. The same with the wild animals as well I can see them, but it's like all the animals that live here are mute or something. I had never noticed any of this before, but now that I have it's like a glaring problem that I can't believe I had never noticed before. So, like the geniuses me and Hunter, we decide to look for answers. I swear I wish I had watched more horror movies, or something similar back then. That weekend, Hunter and I with three of our trusted friends went out into the woods to look for answers. As soon as the sun rose the five of us left for the woods to find out why it was so eerily quiet in the town we lived in. So, we hiked through the woods looking for answers. As we hiked though the woods there wasn’t anything out of the ordinary, so we set up camp a few hours before sunset.

Most of us were used to camping, because it's just camping, nothing special about it. We set up our tents then the fire, and lastly we picked the night watch everyone stood watch for an hour and a half. As the sun had set we drew straws to see who was first for the night watch. It was yours truly, so I was up from 11:00 to 12:30 next was Hunter 12:30 to 2:00. While I was trying to sleep I heard someone talking, and I thought to myself hmmm…I don’t think Hunter knew the rules to camping in the woods that we were currently in. Most of us were raised camping in the woods as a past time, So when I heard him talking I was a bit suspicious because I know for sure everyone is asleep. So, who in the world is he talking to because I can only hear his voice. As I peeked through my tent door all I saw was him talking straight to a tree in the distance, so I got up and said “Hey, who are you talking too?” This dumbass had the gull to say he thought he was talking to me. So, I nodded my head and told him he should sleep more, so he went to my tent and fell back to sleep. Then I heard it as well. Someone started talking to me, not from the tents that were behind me but from the tree line that was in front of me. It started off as small talk, but I would never answer or speak back, I would just stare in its general direction. For a while it would go silent then it would start talking again like it was trying to catch me off guard or something. Then that nagging feeling came back like I was trying to remember something that I had forgotten.

Then, it spoke again its voice this time was different every word it said this time had a different tone to it. Its voice got high then deep, slow then fast; it was like it was testing out how much it can change its voice then it went silent again. As time passed the next shift change started, so I was taped on the shoulder by Hunter's friend Jen. As I had explained what had happened, she decided to wake up the others beside Hunter who was in a deep sleep. Now it was me, Jen, Flin, and John sitting by the fire keeping watch, because neither of us want to sleep now for good reason that is. So, we stayed awake tending to the fire, and watching the tree line. Since we were all watching now I thought to myself again “What am I not remembering.” This time I was really trying to focus on what was missing, then I remembered just like today I was camping but I was with my dad and grandpa. My dad set up the tent and looked for firewood, while me and grandpa were setting rocks in a large circle for the fire. Then I heard my dad call me to him so I got up, and was about to leave then my grandpa suddenly grasped my arm like a vice-grip. My grandpa whispered to me “Stupied, boy did you already forget where your dad was.” then he pointed to my dad that was in the opposite direction to where I was about to walk off to. I was confused at that moment then my grandpa whispered something else “Be Silent, Never Speak, and remember it never forgets a voice that talks back.” As I was thinking back on all of this I noticed something else that was happening around me, Jen, Flin, and John went dead silent. Then I heard it again “S-Shawn, are you there?” as I heard it again I felt a cold sweat go down my spine, because this voice is a new one.

All of us looked at the tent that the hunter was in, but that isn’t where the voice was coming from. We all stayed quiet as it was taunting us with our friends' voices. “W-Where is everyone? I can’t find you guys? Are you there?” The last question was different; it was deeper, and harsher. It sounded like it was breaking. “ARe YOu THere?” Whatever it is, it's getting hysterical that no one was talking back to it. We couldn’t do anything, we were too petrified to move let alone speak but that was probably for the best. At this point everyone looked as white as a sheet of paper. It was getting colder and the fire was dying because nobody was tending to the fire. After a while the fire died and we were left there frozen in fear. The only silver lining is that I can see the sun peeking through the mountain peeks through the treeline. The peeking light was now starting to flow through the trees, then I heard it again “Are YOu THeRe?” Its voice was now completely distorted; it sounded high pitched and gravelly at the same time. I didn’t want to listen to its voice, I just looked through the trees watching the sun rise higher and higher. The sun is now half way up the trees but now I can see it not clearly more like its outline from the sun being behind it. Its body looked distended while its arms and legs were twisted and bent the wrong way round. I stayed staring at it for a while. The others next to me were pale white and shivering. While still looking at it I can hear it talking “ Talk to me! Talk to Me! FUckIng TaLK TO mE !!!” Good thing the others look like they are passed out, because that would have surely gotten a response.

The only reason I stayed silent was because I was too busy shivering. I thought to myself “The sun is about to the top of the treeline somebody would have noticed that we are missing.” It's still staring at me and I’m staring back at it. I’m trying to ignore it to the best of my abilities at this point, but I’m too afraid to turn my eyes from it. Then it spoke again but it was different again, calmer and more controlled “hahahaha, Well I guess today is not that day for you my friend. What a shame it's just you now. hahaha ... .See you soon Shawn.” Then its silhouette slowly started to move down the tree one limb after another until it evenly blended back into the shadows below the trees. As my eyes were about to shut from exhaustion I could hear footsteps creeping up from behind me. Then I felt a hand touch my arm, and then suddenly yanking me back I looked up in relief as I saw my dad, grandpa, and all the other adult men from my town. Just like I guess someone noticed that we were missing. I tried to tell my dad what had happened, but he covered my mouth with his hand and gestured that I remain silent. I still don’t really understand what happened that day. All that I know now is that I lost my friends and my voice. Apparently you can go mute from experiencing something traumatic. So, if you ever find yourself hiking through the woodlands near Ackers just remember “Be Silent, Never Speak, and remember it never forgets a voice that talks back.”
