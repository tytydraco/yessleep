Finally, it was time for my evening rest. I’d had a hard day at work, and around the house there had been plenty to do as well—early summer always meant endless chores. By evening, though, my wife was reading a bedtime story to our daughter, and I gave myself a little time to relax. I sat out on the front porch, sipping a cold beer, and watching the clear, starry sky. Tonight the stars were especially bright.

Then suddenly, a scream cut through the quiet. A woman’s scream, not too far away. It must have come from somewhere on the street, maybe from one of the houses. Squinting in the light of the streetlamps, I tried to see who it was. That’s when I noticed a man a few houses down. He was running. Running like someone was chasing him—or like he was in a race. He was shirtless, barefoot, his soles slapping against the asphalt. He ran into the yard of a house and slammed straight into the front door. I heard the loud thud as he hit the wood. He bounced off, stumbled, but got back up and kept running, as if nothing had happened.

I stood up from my rocking chair to see what the hell was going on. As soon as the man noticed me, he started running in my direction. Fast—like I was his target.


“What the hell’s wrong with you, man?” I shouted when he got closer. “Are you on drugs?”


But he didn’t slow down. He was charging straight at me. I took a step back. There was something terrifying about this unstoppable figure. And when he came even closer, panic seized me. The man was covered in dirt and blood. His legs were caked in mud, his pajama pants torn. A gash split open his forehead, blood streaming down and painting his face red. Still, he didn’t stop—he lunged at me.

But I wasn’t going down without a fight. I smashed the beer bottle in my hand against his head. It exploded into shards, glass spraying everywhere. The man dropped from the blow, but he didn’t pass out. As if nothing mattered, he jumped back up and came at me again. Glass shards were still embedded in his face, and he didn’t even flinch as I heard the crunch of glass under his bare feet.


“Somebody call the cops!” I shouted.


But it was no use. He barreled into me with such force that we both crashed backward, splintering our front door. We tumbled into the living room, wrestling on the floor. I pounded him with everything I had, but he didn’t care. He wanted only one thing: to grab my forehead. Again and again, he reached for me, stretching his arm no matter how many times I shoved him away.

I landed a brutal punch, and his eyes rolled back as if he were unconscious—but his body kept moving. I shoved him aside, and he toppled over the back of the couch. Then another scream rang out. I spun around. It had come from behind me.


“Jesus, Jeremy, what the hell is happening?!” Sandra’s voice cried out from the stairs. She was watching me fight with the man.


“Go back, Sandra! Call the police!” I shouted frantically.


But that moment’s distraction was enough. The man lunged back, right beside me, and pressed his palm against my forehead.


“It’s yours now,” he said hoarsely, blood spilling from his shattered mouth.


Suddenly, everything turned strange. Something seized my body—something I couldn’t control. I was no longer master of my own actions. The next thing I knew, my legs were carrying me—running out through the broken door, into the dark street.


It was a horrible feeling. Like a waking dream—like those sleep paralysis stories I’d read about. I couldn’t move a muscle; not a single part of my body responded. Yet I could see and feel everything. I felt the cool night air blowing across my face, heard the honk of a car horn, and the pounding of my boots echoing down the silent street. My body, however, wouldn’t react to me. It was willing to do only one thing: run. I didn’t know where it was going or why, but it ran as if something was driving it toward a single purpose.

I ran for what felt like forever, until my legs—and the rest of me—should have given out. Eventually, I reached a small row of shops. I’d come here before after work to pick up a few things—maybe half an hour’s walk from our house. My body zeroed in on the liquor store, sprinting with such speed I thought it would tear itself apart. The worst part was, it wasn’t slowing down. The store’s front door was getting closer and closer, and I couldn’t make it stop.

I slammed into the door with bone-jarring force. For a second I thought it might rip out of the wall, but I just bounced off and crashed to the ground. My body, as uncontrollable as ever, immediately pushed itself back up. A red haze clouded over my right eye—probably from a cut on my head—but the pain barely registered. I knew I was hurt, but my body didn’t care. It threw itself against the door again.


“Get the hell out of here!” someone shouted from inside. “We’re closed, you crazy drunk!”


For the briefest moment my body hesitated… or maybe I only imagined it pausing to weigh the words. Then, almost instantly, it spun around and bolted off again, charging through everything in its path. It knocked over a trash bin, tumbled across a bench, and hurled itself back onto the road—which, luckily, was nearly empty at this late hour. Straight ahead, it locked onto the direction of the dark, wooded area nearby.

Even in the forest, there was no stopping. My body just barreled through. Branches, bushes, and undergrowth snagged and cut into me, but none of it mattered. I just kept running, forward and forward, until my strength should have failed. Inside my mind, I was screaming. In my head, the voice howled and begged to stop. But my mouth wouldn’t open. I wasn’t in control of it.

And then came the thing I dreaded most: the steep slope in the woods. I knew this place—we’d gone hiking here before. I knew the slope wasn’t far.

It didn’t take long. In the darkness of the forest, I felt my body suddenly surge forward, faster than I’d ever run in my life. I lost my footing and went tumbling down the hillside, slamming into every bush, every branch, every bit of undergrowth on the way. Until finally—I crashed, full-force, into a tree.

And then there was nothing but darkness.


My mind jolted awake in terror. I was screaming inside again, but my body still wasn’t mine. Maybe I had blacked out earlier, probably from shock… I don’t know. But my body—no longer under my control—was wide awake, and it was running. I was sprinting along the side of a highway in the middle of the night. I didn’t know where I was, or where I was headed, but in the distance, I could already see the glow of a city at night.

I think my body must have run for two straight hours. My mind was foggy, weak, confused. Honestly, I wasn’t even sure how long I’d been running. But the city was right there, looming ahead.

I was terrified that this would be the end—that a car would slam into me, or I’d run headlong into something sharp and impale myself. My body was already covered in injuries. My clothes were stained with blood, and somewhere along the way I’d lost half a boot. But my body wasn’t afraid of the city. It just kept barreling forward as if nothing mattered—across crosswalks, streets, parks, through red lights, bike paths, even splashing through a fountain.

Inside my head, I was screaming. At every corner I thought for sure I’d be hit by a car or smashed against something. But my body just kept running, mechanical, relentless.

My mind could barely take the strain anymore. My vision blurred, the glow of the streetlights smeared together, but still my body pressed on. In a narrow side street, some young people outside a nightclub pointed their phones at me, recording. My body didn’t so much as glance at them. It just kept running, focused on one direction.


Until finally, I reached a large square. At the far end loomed a massive office building, and my body charged straight for it.

I slammed into the thick glass doors with bone-rattling force. The world spun as I crashed to the ground, but my body didn’t care. It scrambled back up immediately.

That’s when I saw the security guard standing in the doorway, staring at me in shock. His face said it all: what the hell is wrong with this guy? But my body didn’t care. It hurled itself at the glass again, smashing against the wall.

The guard spoke into his radio, then swung the door open.


“What the fuck is wrong with you, man? Jesus—you’re covered in blood!” he shouted.


But that was all my body needed. It lunged straight at the guard.


That was all my body needed. No matter how hard I begged inside my head for it to stop, I had no control anymore. I was nothing more than a passenger in my own flesh.

I lunged at the guard—just like that man had once lunged at me in my own home. As I slammed into him at full speed, we both went crashing back into the grand lobby of the office building. We grappled—though really, it was the guard struggling to hold back my uncontrollable body. Because, just like that other man, I had only one goal: to grab his forehead. I fought for it like a wild animal. No matter how hard I screamed inside for my body to stop, it didn’t listen.

With great effort, the guard finally forced me to the ground. Panting, he fumbled for his radio. I assumed he was trying to call for backup, to get someone to help restrain me. But then, the elevator doors slid open across the lobby, and out stepped an elderly man in a white lab coat, carrying a briefcase.

He froze, stunned, as he took in the scene: the guard barely holding me down, while I writhed and thrashed on the floor like a madman.

The moment my body saw the old man—who looked every bit like a doctor—it went completely berserk. My arm tore free of the guard’s grip, and I drove my elbow into his face. The instant he let go, my body sprang up and charged at the old man.

Terrified, the doctor staggered backward into the elevator just as I came rushing toward him. But I was too late—the doors had already closed. I slammed into the sealed metal with a sickening thud. The display showed the cabin rising… to the sixth floor.

Without a shred of hesitation, my body spun around and bolted into the stairwell.


My body charged up the stairs without tiring. Almost nothing could stop it.

Except for a locked door. I slammed into a reinforced metal security door on the sixth floor, the kind that only opened with a keycard. Blood splattered across it as I hit. My nose gushed again, but—like all the other pain—it only came to me faintly, dulled, distant. The door didn’t budge, but my body wasn’t ready to quit. It rammed the door again. By sheer coincidence, that was the moment a member of the janitorial staff was about to come out.

I crashed through his mop cart, scattering everything. The young cleaner hit the floor hard as I bowled him over. But whoever was controlling me didn’t care. My body tore down the hallway, because at the far end stood the old man in the white coat. He was arguing with another security guard—and this one very clearly had a gun. He wasn’t just some front-desk rent-a-cop.

I begged with everything I had to take control back, to stop what I already knew was about to happen. But no one was listening.

The guard immediately drew his weapon the moment he saw me sprinting at them.


“Stop right there!” he shouted, pointing the gun straight at me.


No matter how much I strained, my body kept charging. Sprinting like a lunatic.

The gun fired. A bullet cracked into the ground right in front of me—a warning shot. But my controller didn’t care. I kept rushing forward like a madman. The guard fired again, and this time the bullet tore into my thigh. I felt the searing burn—but my body didn’t stop.

The guard froze in disbelief, unable to process it, and I crashed into him with such force that we both slammed into the wall. He dropped heavily to the ground, dazed, but my body had other plans.

The old man had moved a few steps away, fumbling at a locked door.

Bloody, filthy, I lunged at him.


“No, please, don’t hurt me!” the old man shouted. “I didn’t know this would happen to you!”


I didn’t understand what he meant—or even if he was talking to me at all.

My body straddled the old man. I raised my right hand high, toward the ceiling, then brought it down onto his forehead—the very same hand I had lifted moments ago.


“It’s yours now,” my voice said. But it wasn’t me speaking.


My mind knew it was my voice, but the words weren’t mine. It was as if someone else, far away—maybe not even from this world—was speaking through me.

The instant the words left my mouth, my body collapsed limply to the floor. Agony consumed me—everything burned, every inch of me screamed with pain. I couldn’t even tell what hurt the most. But I was back in control. I had my body again.

Groaning, half-conscious, I lay facedown on the cold marble floor.


“Dr. Gelon, are you okay?!” the guard rushed over at last.


I just lay there, dazed. But the doctor… he wasn’t himself anymore. He slowly got to his feet. From the corner of my eye, I watched every move. He didn’t run, didn’t panic—he simply stood, then walked calmly to the wall. The guard kept asking if he was all right, but the doctor gave no answer.

He just stood against the wall—and slammed his forehead into it. Hard.

Blood split open instantly.

The guard tried to stop him, but the old man kept smashing his head into the wall until nothing was left but a pulped, bloody ruin.

My last memory before blacking out was the guard calling for help over his radio. Then I passed out too.


I don’t know how long I was out, but I woke up in a hospital. Every part of me ached, and I felt like I’d been run over by a truck. The days were hell, and as if that wasn’t enough, people kept coming in and out of my room. Doctors, cops, detectives—even some special unit agents. Everyone had the same thing: endless questions. What happened, how, when. And to all of them I could only tell the same story.

Thankfully, Sandra was finally allowed in after several interrogations, but poor thing—she didn’t know much either. All she could do was try to calm me down a little. The whole thing was nothing but a mystery to me… just like the man who came into my room one night.

He was young, bald, dressed all in black, and reeked of cigarette smoke. He didn’t introduce himself, didn’t really say anything. He only asked me to tell the whole story of what had happened. So I did. I told him everything. He was the only one who stayed calm the entire time, never once interrupting. He listened as if he already knew exactly what I was talking about.

When I finally finished, he stood up from the chair by my bed.


“Hmm,” he said thoughtfully. “So it worked after all.”


I stared at him suspiciously. What worked? Who the hell was this guy?


“Sir…” I asked quietly. “What was all of this, really?”


The bald man gave me a dismissive look.


“That doesn’t matter,” he said after a pause. “What matters is that the transfer worked. And that old man won’t be meddling in things he should’ve stayed out of anymore.”


I had a thousand more questions. But the moment I opened my mouth to ask even one, the man simply walked out of the room.

The last thing burned into my mind was his strange black eyes—looking at me as if I were nothing more than some roadside cockroach.
