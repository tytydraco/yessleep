I live in a small town in Eastern Hungary, my friend Daniel invited me and four of my friends to his house to eat, drink and play some boardgames, which we did, but at the end we eventually were too drunk and left at 1 am. 2 of my friends Pista and Erik lived in the nearby town so they left by car.

However me and 2 of my friends Dus and Kevin were not tired at all, so on the way home we decided to take a detour and head to one of the 'famous' streets in the town, the Han street which is a street that is so long that it goes out of the town and at the wnd of the street there is a small abandoned house, a farm and a small church, the street outside of the town is surrounded by workfields, and a small forest.

So we took a detour to the Han street and we wanted to see how it looked at night, and actually there was a thunderstorm that night so it looked even creepier, we were joking about finding a 'skinwalker', Kevin has a twitch channel so we started a live stream, but unfortunately we only had 1 viewer and that was one of our friends. 

So walking on the Han street we stopped to piss and we heard motorcycle noises, coming from the village, we stopped and looked who is that. And we have seen a bike without lights coming towards us.

The Biker stopped and said "What are you doing out here at 2 am?"

Dus said "We are just walking around here".

At this point it was pitch black, but Dus had a torch with him, and he was courius about who are we talking to so he turned it on and damn we fucking shit our pants because the biker wore a Money Heist mask under the helmet.

The biker responded "Don't go any fruther... there are dangerous wild boars around here at night"

I did not said a word, I was only nodding because I was shitting my pants. 

Kevin said with a frightened voice "Okay, thank you, have a good ride"

The Mystical biker then turned around and went away. We shit our pants so we went back to the village and decided to go home, on the way home another strange thing happened, we went by an livestock animal keeper and while Kevin was writing his mom that everything is ok and we are on our way home we heard a very strange noise, it sounded like a pig grunting very loudly but at the same time it sounded like an angry man shouting and a dog barking. It sounded like a pig human thing, I don't know how to explain it but it gave us the creeps.

I have multiple questions:

Who is that biker?

How was he driving around in pitch black with no light in a full Money Heist mask?

Has he really had good intentions? 

What was that noise that came from that house?
