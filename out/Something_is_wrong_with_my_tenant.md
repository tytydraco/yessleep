I’ve seen dead bodies before. I know what they’re supposed to look like, even smell like but this just wasn’t right. I saw my first body when I was maybe 7 years old? It’s not as morbid as it sounds, I promise. I was attending my uncle's funeral, an open casket event seeing as he died of a heart attack. It was probably 1978? I remember straining on my tiptoes to get a look at my once living uncle. I remember having a hard time getting a look over his huge belly. I hadn’t remembered it being that big when he was alive. When your that young you see a lot of people's bellies. I found it odd how swollen it seemed, practically bursting out of his black suit. When i got a look at his face my first thought was, “it's the wrong body.” When a body has been embalmed it looks different. Funeral technology wasn’t quite as good as it is these days and it showed. His face was waxy but he looked peaceful. My uncle was dead but it was hard to connect the man I knew to this immobile thing sitting in a crate.

The second time I saw a body was about 20 years later. My biological father passed away and left me a building in his will. It wasn’t his body I saw, mind you. I was never super close to my father. I saw him every week for years but we never really… clicked. We felt more like siblings than father and daughter. When he passed I couldn’t find myself incredibly sad. Call me cold but that’s the truth. I was excited to see the property he left me. When I drove to the house on Hilltop road I found a two story manor that had been divided into flats. I hadn’t known that my father had been a landlord. The building was old, not very old but old for a house. It had certain accents that made it seem much older but it was in alright condition. It’s outside was a little battered, peeling pain and ticketing gutters but I was confident I could fix her up. 

Angela was my first tenant. She was 70 when she moved in and was a picture of “sweet old lady.” She and her dog Bruce, a brown basset hound who’s long ears dragged on the ground, moved into a unit on the ground. The two of them were an odd couple but very good tenants. From the moment I took her on I knew Angie would die here. She seemed to know it too. She had no children, no husband, once confessing to me under the cover of some sherry that she was a lesbian from the time when that wasn’t cool. I told her I thought she was very cool. At the time it was just me and her filling that dusty building so we got to know each other rather well. I made a habit of checking on her everyday. She was… well, old so there were times when she was forgetful. I’d pop by every morning to make sure she had taken her meds and fed Bruce. We would chat over a cuppa and she’d reminisce about the disco. 

At some point it got rather bad. She wouldn’t remember taking her medication and I'd have to convince her that I saw her take it. Once I'd seen her try and give her meds to Bruce which was an interesting morning. It became clear that she was winding down. Bruce seemed to know it too, looking up at me with his sad eyes. I checked in one morning, knocking softly to no answer. I knocked again, still nothing. I knew but I still got out my key and locked her door. There she was, slumped on the floral sofa, Bruce sat next to her, resting his head on her lap. She didn’t really look dead. Just still. Her cheeks were no longer rosy but I could have sworn she was just sleeping. She was gone though.

I ended up moving into her flat. Bruce couldn’t bear to part with the place and I couldn’t part with Bruce. After that I cycled through tenants for the next 20 years until last year. I rented the flat above mine to a young lady named Rayna Dabrowsky. When we met she introduced herself as Ray and shook my hand with an infectious smile. She was young, 22 when she moved in. I found it odd that she wasn’t in uni but I really shouldn’t judge. Her path was her own and it was none of my business as long as she paid rent. She was a rather good tenant. She left at around 9 in the morning everyday and stayed out until 9 at night. I assumed she has some kind of customer service job because she left dressed in nice pants and blouses, blonde bob cut straightened into a perfect bulb. I knew all this because after I got the new tenants I decided to install some more modern security measures. Both of them lived on the second floor so I bought a camera that nestled nicely into the corner overlooking the intersection where both the rooms' doors stood. I could access the feed on my home computer and checking it became muscle memory for whenever I was bored. I worked from home, you see, I wasn’t just a landlord. It was routine for me to check the camera’s every morning after breakfast, where I’d catch Ray locking up and greeting her neighbor whose name I can’t quite recall.

I had no problems with Ray living above me. She was very quiet when she was in the house. I guessed she passed time by reading though that might be because she dressed like a middle aged librarian. There was one time where she had to knock on my door and mutter through her embarrassment that she had knocked a hole in the wall when swatting a spider. Other than that she was lovely. I’m not sure exactly when the change happened.

 When I went to check the cameras I’d see that she wasn’t dressed for work or just popping her head out of her door before retreating back inside. I found it a little odd but she might have just been an odd person. There was a point where I was upstairs for a reason I can’t remember. Ray opened her door, just a crack really, just enough for the hallway light to show her sickly features. She looked bad. Really bad. Her skin was pale and shiny. Her lips were cracked bluish and her well kept bob was grown out and greasy. Brown peaked out from the roots and it hung in a stringy attempt at curls. She squeaked and shut the door quickly.

That was odd enough but it wasn’t until later that week that I realized she hadn’t exited the flat in days. I know it seems like spying to watch for her on the cameras but I really had the best intentions. At first I thought rather deftly that she was taking a staycation. She was a bit of a workaholic so I thought maybe she finally was taking a break. My memory drifted to that odd encounter on the stairwell. She hadn’t looked well at all. Maybe she was staying home to rest her sickness away. Yes that must have been it.

It was then that I worked up the courage to go check on her. I didn’t have as close of a relationship with these tenants as I had had with Angie but I didn’t want to neglect them. And Ray… seemed to be in a bad way. So I walked up to her door and gave it a knock. There was no response. About 30 seconds later I knocked again. I was about to knock a third time when I noticed the state of the door. There was some sort of liquid turning the bottom portion darker. It wasn’t water, it was too dark but my landlord instincts kicked in and I assumed we had a leak. I knocked harder and called out to her. No response. I admit this was stupid but I’m not sure if it would’ve changed anything. I decided to give it a day. Goddammit, why on earth did I give it a day.

I don’t remember drinking that night but I must have passed out on the sofa because I awoke slouched there with Bruce Jr. draping his long ears over my lap. It was dark in the room, the shades had been pulled to prevent being woken by the morning light by a single streak of it cast onto the far wall where the television was set up. I could hardly make it out but there was something on the wall behind the tellie. I thought maybe wires but the plug was low to the floor. Something was making a vertical line down the wall, just barely illuminated by the sun. Bruce Jr. whined when I got up to flick the lights. The light revealed a large dark drip and it was growing fast. The stain was brownish red and slipped down the wall with a disgusting unhurriedness. It was thick and slow and gross. I’m not stupid. I knew it was blood but it just wasn’t right. It was too thick, too sticky. The smell began to permeate my flat, sickly sweet and metallic like spoiled molasses.


I went up to Ray’s flat. This time the door collapsed when I knocked, folding like a wet playing card. The lights were off but Ray had left the window over the sink's shades open. The beautiful sunrise spread over her body like a blanket. She was sat against the wall, legs splayed out like she had fallen, neck bent lifelessly to the side. Her hands were palm up on the cold tile floor and I realized sickening that she was surrounded by a poor of dark, rotting blood. I don’t know why the appearance of her corpse is burned so clearly in my memory. Why my uncle or Angie both who I loved dearly, only stayed in there fleetingly, I don’t know. Rayna Dabrowsky was dead and rotting, seeping her fluids all over my renovated kitchen floor. The cheeks and eyes were sunken and discolored with what looked like bruising. Thing was the bruising had an odd texture that caught to like. The bruises formed rings like circles of mold on an orange. That was it. There was mold covering her body, making colorful patches on exposed skin like some spoiled imitation of clown paint. Yellow green lines paved into her skin making sickeningly intricate designs. Brownish drool hung from her lips, staining the soft jumper she had on. Bodies are not meant to look like that, I know. She had been dead maximum days but she… it couldn’t have happened that fast. It was like she… rotted while alive.

I was just about to reach in my pocket to phone the police when her decomposing lungs wheezed out a breath of air. I startled so hard I dropped my phone and it hit the blood with a wet smack. It didn’t splash like liquid should, it was too thick. Her body let out this horrible gurgle and she lurched forward. Her unblinking dead eyes rolled to look at me. Her normally blue irises were milky pale and her pupils might have well been gone. I think she was trying to say something so against my better instincts I tried to listen. All I could make out was, “sorry ’bout the mess.”
