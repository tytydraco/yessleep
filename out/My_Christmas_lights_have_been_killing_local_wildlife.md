Something is wrong with the wildlife in my rural West Virginia town. Very wrong. And I’m worried whatever is going on has started to affect humans too.

I work as a Christmas light installer with one of my high school buddies, Josh. 

Over the summer as Josh was managing our inventory he realized how much extra the normal order from China was going to be due to the tariffs. 

Being the scrappy, albeit sometimes shady, business man he is, he found another supplier in China “Christmas Cheer” who was willing to ship at a fraction of the cost. Apparently they would rough up the lights enough to export at lower tariffs as “scrap” but still wind up being passable as new to our customers. 

In the end we saved about 20% on our regular order even after tariffs. 

As soon as we received our lights the supplier went dark. Nothing online, and all of the emails and phone numbers we were using to communicate with Christmas Cheer were disconnected. Odd, but not entirely out of the ordinary. 

The season started off slow. Christmas light installs are discretionary spending to a tee and the economy has been hard on everyone this year. Fortunately we have a few dozen long term customers who always have family coming around for the holidays and our installs have become a tradition for them. 

We always get started in the end of October or early November. If I had a dollar for every passerby who quipped “Oh it’s christmas already??” I would be long retired. This works well for us in the mountains as the weather can be unpredictable closer to the holidays. We install early and then set timers just after Thanksgiving. 

That's when this all started. Just after Thanksgiving. 

Dozens of animals were showing up dead in people’s yards every morning.

Ms. Stewart was the first to make a report of two otherwise healthy deer, and two raccoons. The bizarre part was that their eyes were glowing. The report said that the bodies were cold to the touch but their eyes were emanating light. 

More and more reports started to come in once the news ran Ms. Stewart's story. People reported that they had dead birds, squirrels, and mice which they had just thrown out without taking note of their eyes. 

Once the news started it was constant. All throughout the holidays people in town were finding more and more animals dead every morning. People started locking their pets inside at night since no one had any answers.

Coming back from the holidays Josh and I hit the ground running taking down our client’s lights. The weather was a perfect 60 and sunny for working outside. 

That’s when I noticed it. As we were taking down lights I realized that every one of the houses we were going to had been in the news. 

We took down all of the lights in just six days. 

On the seventh day, suddenly the news stopped. One week was a frenzy of panic, and the next it had seemingly resolved itself without answers. 

On Saturday Josh and I went to Sheen’s steakhouse, a local favorite and an end of season tradition for us. Josh was rattling off profit margins and client retention statistics, phone in one hand, buffalo wing sauce already three inches past his other wrist. 

“Did you notice that every single incident with the animals happened at one of our client's houses?” I interrupted.

Josh paused. His eyes shifted from his phone to the wall behind me.

“There weren’t any incidents anywhere that we didn’t put up new lights this year.” I continued.

“And as soon as we took the lights down it all stopped.”

Josh placed his phone down on the table and wiped his hands on his napkin.

“You don’t think… we’ve been doing this for 15 years. 15 years. There’s no way.. there’s just no way there’s any causation.” Josh replied. He looked like he was putting the pieces together but fighting the connection. 

“We used a different supplier dude. Christmas Cheer just dropped off the face of the earth. They were there and now they're gone.” 

I wanted to believe him. That there was no way. It doesn’t make any sense. Christmas lights don’t just kill animals overnight and leave them with glowing eyes in the morning.

Josh didn’t stick around long after that. He left in a rush, seeming concerned, saying he needed to get back to check his emails with Christmas Cheer to see if there was any way to get a hold of them. 

I went over to Josh’s this morning to tidy up his garage where we keep all the lights over the summer. 

I texted him that I was on my way over and got no response. Figures. I had stayed at Sheen’s for another four pints after he left, lord knows what he got into once he got home. 

I went around the side of the garage where he always keeps the door open figuring I could get to work and let him sleep it off. 

What I saw in the garage will haunt me for years. 

Josh pulled hundreds of strings of lights out of their boxes and had them all plugged in. He was hunched over a bundle of mini lights in the corner. The same exact multi colored ones that were in Ms. Stewart’s spruce tree just a week ago.

He turned to meet my stunned gaze, his eyes glowing brighter than any of the lights in the garage. 

“This is all my fault. I don’t know how, but this is all my fault.”
