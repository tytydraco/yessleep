The next day I was tired. 

Erica and I both called in from work. (I insisted E stay home today so we could talk and take a break.) 

The vision was eating away at me, so I decided to tell E about it. 

She looked uncomfortable as I did. She wouldn’t meet me at my eyes the entire time. 

We didn’t do much, then decided to go to dinner at a restaurant. 

Once there, Erica started looking nervous. 

“Did you not want to eat here babe?” I ask kind of questioning why she’s acting strangely. 

“No no, it’s fine.” 

We walk in a take a table with 3 seats because it’s all they have left for small groups. 

We had just received menus to look at when a strange girl walks up to the table. 

Dyed pink hair, pink sweater, red skirt, and hazel eyes. 

She’s wearing lots of makeup and looks sorta out of place. 

She smiles at us. 

“Hehe, mind if I join you?” 

Before I can process Erica actually nods and the girl sits down. 

I look across the table and Erica won’t meet my eyes again. 

“Hey, Erica, mind if we talk about something over here?” 

She almost winces when I say this, but gets up and follows me. 

I give a fake smile to the intruder, then lead Erica over to the bathroom. 

“Okay, what is going on her? Who is she and why are you acting weird?” 

As I try to control my voice, if comes out as a hiss. 

Erica is balking at telling me. 

I give up and go to the table deciding to question the girl instead. 

But as I am walking back I suddenly feel extremely uncomfortable. 

Through the windows I see a little girls face watching the restaurant. She quickly fades away. 

The girl at the table is still there.
I get more and more uneasy as I approach her. 

When she turns and looks at me I know I need to run. 

Her eyes have rolled all the way back in their sockets.  

She pulled off the sweater to reveal a tee shirt that had been cut above her stomach. 

There, where the flesh of her tummy should be, was a huge gaping mouth. Black ooze around the edges and a huge pink tongue.

The girl started to push over the table. 

Then leaping on top of the nearby bar, began smashing glasses. Glass was flying everywhere. 
People were screaming and trying to run out of the building. 

I ran back to the bathroom, realizing Erica hadn’t come out. 

When I found her she was laying on the floor, back against the wall. 

“Babe! Erica, come on, we have to leave!” 

I tried to pick her up and help her, but she stopped me. 

“Babe, you leave. Get somewhere safe. It’s…too late f ffor me now…” 

She was struggling to speak. I could now see black ooze coming out the corner of her mouth. 

E what happened?! 

“That girl, she’s a demon. She trapped me and I was poisoned. She didn’t kill me, but “it’s” toxins mixed with my blood. 
That’s a human shell Cy, whatever that thing is is inside her. The human is dead.”

She said this all breathless. I was holding her head now. 

“How long have you been sick for E?” 

Tears were starting to fall down my face. 

Erica tried to speak, but then couldn’t manage. She gasped for air once, then stopped breathing. 

I then heard something slam against the bathroom door. 

The thing had found me. With E gone now I didn’t know what to do. 

I stood up and looked for an escape. 

Seeing none. 

The demon entered.
It now was carrying 2 kitchen knives in its hands. 

“Why did you do this to her!?” I said screaming and pointing at E.

The demon now seemed incapable of talking, it just stood there with the knives. 

As it came forward at me I dodged and ran out the door. 

I ran as fast I as I could out to my car.

The restaurant was in chaos. Broken glass everywhere, people laying injured or dead, blood on the floors. A window had even been broken. 

Once out in my car I started it and drove a bit away. 

Once I thought I had a moment, I stopped the car and told the police the whole story. I didn’t go back until about an hour to the restaurant. 


Once there the police informed me that Erica was actually okay miraculously. I was stunned. She hobbled out and met me outside. I hugged her. 

“I am so glad you’re okay!” 

She smiled but didn’t say anything. 

We stood together as police also informed us that the demon had died, leaving the human shell with a huge scar across its stomach where the mouth had “withered” and rolled inward. 

Why it picked that person we don’t know, it could have been random or calculated. 

The demon had died of lack of energy. It hadn’t eaten enough and used it’s last bit of life chasing me.

The restraint had mostly been cleaned up, the bodies had been taken and the survivors hospitalized. 

I realized the vision I had of the girl on the couch looked a bit like the girl the demon had been using. 

Had I momentarily seen the future? I’ll never know, but after tonight me and Erica haven’t been bothered. The murders in our area completely stopped too. It seems the demon had been killing people. 


I’ll have a separate post on E’s story, we’re both tired rn and are going to rest.
