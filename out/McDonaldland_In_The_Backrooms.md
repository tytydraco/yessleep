It was the summer of my high school graduation, around 2014. For months my friends and I had been planning a celebration trip where we would get fucked up and if we were lucky, maybe have a hookup or two. Unfortunately for me, my parents weren't too keen on underage drinking, premarital sex, or indulging in illegal substances. In other words, pretty much anything a teenager nearly into adulthood would find entertaining aside from staying home and playing video games. Not to mention, my dad was a cheapskate.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The day I turned sixteen he made me go out and get a part-time job. Even before then, I worked under the table for some friends of his. Long story short, my parents saw fun as a waste of time. However, that Summer I thought that I would finally get to enjoy myself. I'd accumulated some money working at Publix and I intended to use it to splurge a little on the trip. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I figured I'd earned it between managing to juggle school and work. My parents didn't see it that way and began pushing me to sign up for college immediately after I got my diploma. Every time I tried to argue with them I'd get a lecture about how they were able to succeed while handling ten times the responsibilities I had. I suspected these claims to be straight horseshit, but they denied it. They also told me that I complained too much and that my generation was weak. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dejected and not seeing going with my friends to be worth the headache my parents would give me later, I planned to skip and go on another trip with them after we started college. My dad wanted me to pick up more hours of work, but I convinced him that I could better spend my time submitting college applications. While this wasn't entirely a lie, I was mainly using it as a means to give myself some time off. About a week after graduation, I got a call from work.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My manager explained that one of my workers couldn’t make it due to a near-fatal encounter with a grizzly bear on a weekend fishing trip. My parents were in a bad mood that day so I agreed to fill in for him. I was informed that I would be working a closing shift. That was okay with me since nighttime tended to be more relaxing. Little did I know, the day part of my shift would try my patience.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I know raising kids can’t be easy. God damn are they annoying, though. Several knocked glass jars off shelves. One was running around, screaming his head off. Another took a piss in the cleaning aisle and one puked on my apron. To my credit, I did handle it well and eventually, the chaos did wind down. Closing time came and once I finished my work, I left the store to go home.

&#x200B;

I had to take the bus since I didn’t have enough money saved for a car. As an aside, my parents were planning on charging me rent as soon as I became eighteen.  I needed to move out and fast. While I sat on the bus stop bench, I thought about what I’d be doing with my future. With my mind occupied, I failed to notice the group of four approaching me until they called my attention.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey. man. You mind helping us out?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Their jitteriness tipped me off that they were tweakers.

“Sorry, I don’t have any money on me.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The leader came closer, scratching the back of his neck.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Come on, man. We just need like five dollars. That’s all.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I got off the bench. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Ask someone else then because I don’t have it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They didn’t take my answer well and got ready to attack.  It wasn’t my first time encountering those kinds of people.  I brandished my pocket knife which usually was enough to deter these kinds of people. They pulled out knives of their own.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Aw shit.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was off like a bullet the second they sprang forward. They weren’t far behind me and had the advantage of being on drugs. Stores were closed at that time so my best bet was to try to make it back to Publix and hope my manager was still there to let me back in. First, I needed to lose my pursuers. Luckily, there were a lot of turns I could make.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I cut behind some buildings and doubled back to try and throw them off. Unfortunately, they knew the layout even better than I did and cornered me in an alleyway. The leader smiled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Why did you have to make things difficult? All we wanted was some cash.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced around, trying to find some form of escape. I was fucked. All I could do was back away. Expecting to feel the brick wall behind me, I was shocked when I fell backward. I let out a grunt after landing on my back. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Disoriented, I sat up to survey my surroundings. On the plus side, I was no longer being chased by knife-wielding junkies. On the downside, I didn’t have a goddamn clue where I was. From the looks of it, I seemed to be on the upper level of a mall. This was confusing because the closest one to me would’ve been about a ten-minute drive. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Furthermore, this didn’t appear to be my local one as indicated by the interior. The place appeared to be empty which wasn’t odd to me given the time I thought it was. However, I did find it strange that none of the security gates were down. Questions could wait. First, I needed to find an exit. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This turned out to be easier said than done. I thought it would be a simple matter of using the stairs and then cutting through one of the stores. I soon learned that how I got there was only scratching the surface of how weird that place was.  Upon stepping into Dillard’s. I was met with even more weirdness.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That place was huge. In fact, it appeared even longer than the mall itself. While I did have my phone on me, its signal was weak. Ten minutes of walking got me nowhere. Annoyed, I decided to take a break and think about whether I should keep going or try another store. By that time, my stomach was rumbling. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There were some boxes of Godiva and I hadn’t noticed any security cameras. Despite it not being the healthiest thing to eat, I needed something to tide me over. It was when I was chewing on my fourth piece did I hear movement around me. The way I would describe it is rapid clicking steps. Skittishly, I looked around for the noise’s source. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was no way in hell I would’ve been able to explain to security what I was doing there. Little did I know, what was heading for me was much worse. As I kept hearing yet not seeing anything, I realized that my imagination could’ve been running wild. Then I saw the mannequins. There were twelve in total and they were spider-walking across the floor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Several phrases ending in fuck or shit flashed through my head and I dropped my Godiva chocolates. They were faster than you’d think for what they were made of and were nearly on me before I was able to turn tail. Several times I felt them graze me with their wooden hands. I thought I was a goner because even if I made it out of the store, they would still be chasing me. However, I was surprised when the sounds of them giving chase vanished the instant I escaped.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Looking back, I found that they were now standing still at the exit and were now in normal poses. I was covered in sweat by then and I needed to catch my breath. Things would only get worse from there.  I didn’t want to take any chances with the other stores so I figured my safest option would be to try finding one of the main exits. Similar to the stores, the mall seemingly went on forever. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even if there wasn’t anything immediately trying to kill me, being trapped there wasn’t any more of a comforting thought. Eventually, I came to the food court. By that point, I could’ve eaten a horse and drunk a lake. Many restaurants stretched before me, the closest of which happened to be McDonald’s. Since I didn’t know how to work the equipment, I thought that maybe I could find some leftover salads.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

However, when I stepped past the counter, something I never could’ve predicted happened. Everything changed. The mall was gone and I was in a city. At first, I thought that I had made it back outside. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“After him,” someone yelled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I looked behind me and was dumbfounded to see a man in a black hat with a yellow brim and black and white jail-striped overcoat running toward me. This wasn’t the strangest thing I’ve witnessed in the city. The cops with burgers for heads on the other hand made me nope out of there. I had an idea of where I was, but I couldn’t believe it.  Those burger guys were freaky as hell because their eyes were disturbingly human. The only thing worse than me seeing them was them seeing me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Come on,” the guy they were chasing shouted as he ran past me.

&#x200B;

“After them,” one of the burger cops yelled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even though I didn’t have the slightest clue what was going on when they drew their guns I didn’t need to be told to run. A black and white stripe helicopter landed on the other end of the alley and we jumped in. We were fired at as we were taking off. The bullets only bounced off the metal. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How’s the haul?” One of the pilots asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He smirked and opened his coat, causing bags with a yellow letter m to fall to the floor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Way to go, Hale,” the other one said.

&#x200B;

“All in a day's work,” he replied to them.

&#x200B;

“What the hell’s going on?” I screamed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Everyone looked at me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, Hale, who’s the newbie?”

&#x200B;

“Beats me. Hey, guy, you mind telling us who you are?”

&#x200B;

“What? First, you explain where we are.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Their expressions changed to ones of surprise.

&#x200B;

“So you’re an outsider,” Hale said. “You’ll want to sit down then. This’ll be a lot to take in.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He confirmed what I’d been suspecting. I was in McDonaldland. I told everyone how I’d gotten there and they explained that many people had ended up there in similar ways. Apparently, The Backrooms has many McDonald’s entrances to that place. However, unlike how it’s portrayed in the commercials, this place was as far from cheerful as you could get.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

During the helicopter ride, I was given a brief rundown of the world’s history. Ronald McDonald, known by the nickname Red Ron, was a brutal dictator that owned all the political power in McDonaldland. He used this to try and enslave people into doing his bidding or he would starve them since he controlled all food production. The only force able to oppose this was Hale and his group of thieves.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We can only do so much with our resources limited, though,” Hale said sadly.

&#x200B;

“Okay, I admire what you guys are doing. I really do, but how do I get back to my world? Is there a portal or something you can drop me off at and then I can skedaddle?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They stared stone-faced at me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Sorry, you better get used to living here,” Hale said.

&#x200B;

“What do you mean?” I asked, laughing nervously.

&#x200B;

“I mean you’re probably trapped here.”

&#x200B;

“No. No. No. No.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Everything began spinning as the harsh reality of my situation sit in.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I can’t be stuck here. I just can’t, “ I yelled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hale grabbed my shoulders and shook me, attempting to stop my freakout. When this didn’t work, he slapped my face. That made me stop.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I said probably so quit bitching.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My breathing was calmed although still a bit rapid.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Is there a chance I can escape then?”

&#x200B;

“I can’t make any guarantees, but I know someone that may be able to help.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ear-piercing shrieks disrupted our conversation. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What was that?” I asked, jumping.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hale’s eyes narrowed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Birdies.”

&#x200B;

“Birdies? You can’t mean…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced out the window, confirming my fears. Harpies that were a mix of canary and human were flying toward us. Each one wore differently colored jumpsuit shorts, goggles, and scarves. The one at the front was yellow and her jumpsuit was pink. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Go faster," I demanded.

&#x200B;

"You think we wouldn't if we could," one of the pilots snapped.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With their speed, the Birdies caught up to us. They’ll forever haunt my nightmares with their razor-sharp beaks and cries that were like glass shards being rubbed on violin strings. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“At least they can’t get in, right?” I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The leader, the Birdie, smashed into a window, cracking it slightly and causing the helicopter to tilt.  Screaming, I fell back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You won’t escape us this time, Hale,” she hissed, “Ron always gets what he wants.”

&#x200B;

“Please tell me you guys have weapons,” I said.

&#x200B;

“A few,” Hale replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The helicopter was put on autopilot and then Hale and his friends got some rifles out from by their seats.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Here, take this,” he said, handing me a pistol.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Reluctantly, I accepted it. The birdies continued their assault and we knew the helicopter couldn’t take much more. We cocked our weapons and when they broke through, we retaliated. At such close range, we were able to pick a few of them off. However, Birdie eluded us. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 She and her underlings changed tactics and attacked our underside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Shit, we can’t hit them like this,” one of the pilots said.

&#x200B;

“We’ll have to jump for it,” Hale said, grabbing a parachute and the bags of burgers.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Luckily for me, there was a spare. I’d never been skydiving before nor did I intend to. Now, I would have to do just that to save my life. The harpies damaged the helicopter enough to make it lose control and next thing we knew, we were plummeting toward the woods below.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s now or never,” Hale shouted, “Jump.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I didn’t have any clue what I was doing so I followed by example. I deployed my parachute when everyone else did and we landed in some tree branches, We weren’t out of the woods yet. In fact, we were in them and the Birdies were still in pursuit. Tangled in the branches, I could only let out a squeak as the Birdies flew at us with open talons.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With no escape, I closed my eyes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I got some shit to do so I’ll be uploading within the next couple days. See you all then.
