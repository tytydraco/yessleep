I moved into this cabin three years ago. It’s quiet, edge of town, not isolated by any means. Trees in every direction. No neighbors quite close enough to bother me. There is only one streetlight near the end of the driveway and it never feels bright enough. I liked that at first. I worked nights and slept in the mornings. I needed silence. I thought this place offered peace.

I have a cat named Rye, he had belonged to the previous owner. An older man died and his family left the animal behind. They said they would come back for him but they never did. I fed him a few times and he decided I was his new person. He’s a gray tabby, scarred across one ear and always on alert. At first I thought it was because of his new home, or his age. Now I think he already knew something that I did not.

The chittering started during the second winter. At first it startled me until I realized it was just the cat, it woke me once or twice a week. A sound like he was trying to speak but with no words. When I was younger my cats would do this when they saw birds or chipmunks out the window. Like a squirrel sound but directed at something specific. I would find him in the living room just outside my bedroom. His body rigid. Tail low. The house would feel off. Like the air was too heavy in that corner. 

I shrugged it off. Rural areas have wildlife. Maybe a raccoon. Maybe a stray cat. I kept sleeping.

Then it became every night.

Always at four in the morning. Always at the same window. I would wake up without an alarm and feel something there. The darkness outside looked thick. My cat would stare into it and I could not pull him away.

I tried ignoring it. I tried sleeping through it. I even turned the bed so I would face the other direction. None of that changed anything.

One night I heard a reply.

Not loud. Not clear. A sound like breath pressed through teeth. Almost a whisper but not language. When it ended my cat went crazy. He shot away from the window sill into the kitchen. Tail twitching. That was the first time I felt afraid.

I told myself it was an animal. The brain likes excuses. Mine went through every possible explanation before ever landing on the one I already sensed.

There was something out there. It was watching through the glass. And my cat knew it long before I did.

I started staying awake, hoping to see it. Every time I got up and turned on the lights the yard looked empty. The trees stood still. The snow untouched. I almost convinced myself I imagined the sound.

Almost.

One night I woke up, it was darker than usual, the silence was so heavy I could hear my heartbeat. I thought the power was out. I got up and stood in the hall. Lights off. Waiting. My cat walked past me and went straight to the window like he followed orders. He stared out with no hesitation. Then he started that chittering again.

I looked at the stove in the kitchen from the living room, at 4:03 I saw movement outside. Something slipped between trees. It looked too large to be any animal I could think of, but it wasn’t a man. I saw the shape but not the face. It paused. My heart beat so hard I worried it would give me away.

The creature stayed still for a long time. Then it stepped back into the dark. My cat jumped off the ledge and hid under the bed. That sent me over the edge. I needed to know what I was dealing with.

The next morning I walked the tree line. The morning frost showed no prints. No sign any living thing had passed through. My yard looked untouched. But I knew I had seen it.

I talked to one of the older locals in town a few days later. He ran the hardware store. He was the kind of guy who spent his whole life within ten miles of where he stood. I came in often and he knew me well. I asked if anyone else had seen or heard strange things at night recently. He gave a quizzical look. 

“You live near the Penobscot woods right?” he asked.

I nodded.

“You leave a light on?” he asked.

“Sometimes.”

“Leave it on every night, animals avoid the light. Other things too.”

“Other things?”

I asked what he knew. He didn’t have a name for it. He only said this place had stories before settlers arrived. He said they described something that prowled like a mountain lion, crouched like a human, but did not think like one. Something that copied voices. Something that would move through the woods faster than any horse. I’d heard these stories before but always held it in the back of my mind as fables spoken of by the Natives.

After that talk I installed a brighter porch light, and a motion activated light on the side of my house. It stopped the chittering for two nights. Then it came back louder than before. My cat sat pressed against the window. Almost shaking from tension. He looked like prey. That terrified me. He was never really afraid of anything.

Then came the night I saw it fully.

I stayed in the hall again. No lights. I stood behind the bedroom doorway and watched the window. I saw my reflection. I saw the cat. Then I saw something move behind the glass.

The porch light was on but illuminated the creature enough to reveal its complexion. Its skin was pale, grey white. Like snow under moonlight. It crawled across the yard, its muscles rippled as it moved, skin stretched too tight. The eyes were dark but wide. It had a thick coat of hair on its back and some on the rear of its arms and legs. The mouth hung open, but it had no jaw, just an open cavity. Ripped flaps of flesh for what should have been lips. It had glossy clouded eyes. It did not blink.

It moved in the dark barely illuminated by the porch light. It pointed its head at the cat. Then at me.

I froze. My cat went silent. The creature tilted its head. The motion was slow and deliberate.

Its tongue snaked out from its throat, the open cavity widened. It let out a trill, then chittered, almost exactly the way the cat had. It’s jagged top lip curled to the sides, it started to seemingly smile, but with its eyes. Its cheeks pressing its bottom eyelids up over its glossy eyes. Thats when I realized It couldn’t see. Its throat opened again, it let out another chitter. It moved slowly to the back of the cabin, softly crunching the frosty leaves in my yard. 

Once it crossed the window the motion activated light clicked on. It illuminated the creature immediately, and in one instant it was gone. It bounded into the woods faster than I could have imagined. My heart pounded so hard I felt dizzy.

That was the last night the cat chittered at the window. Now he avoids that side of the house. He sleeps with his back against the wall like he expects something to reach for him.

This isn’t my first time encountering this creature. If any of you have any information about this being and what it could possibly be, please reach out. 
I captured a photo of the creature on one of my trail cams not far north of my cabin. Heres a photo for reference.
