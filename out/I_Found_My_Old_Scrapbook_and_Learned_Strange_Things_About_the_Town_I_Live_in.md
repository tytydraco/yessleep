My family has always been at the center of my life. I grew up in this quiet town where my childhood was spent, with my mother, father, and sibling. 

That house, those streets, and those people meant everything to me. But now, I'm embarking on a mysterious journey into my past, and this journey begins with my family.  
  
My family was the most precious treasure in my life. My father's warm laughter, my mother's loving smile, and the unforgettable moments I shared with my sibling... They all became immortal memories for me. They were the building blocks of my childhood in this town.  
  
My family was also the custodian of memories. Our old photo album was a sacred book that carried traces of our past. Each page would bring back memories of moments we once lived. The photos were filled with memories of our family's happy moments.  
  
Recently, I revisited my long-forgotten family album. As I flipped through the pages, my hands felt like they were reliving the memories to bring them back to life. And in that moment, I found a mysterious photograph on one of the pages.  
  
In the photograph, we had stopped on a road as a family and taken a picture together. In the background, there was a signboard for a town named "**Sonhoax**." I remembered the town; my childhood was spent there.

However, I didn't recall this name at all. As far as I knew, the town was called "**Xtress**." This strange discrepancy piqued my curiosity.  
  
Why was the town's name so different? And why did this new name appear in our family album? My family had never mentioned anything about this name.  
  
This enigma sent shivers down my spine, and I felt the need to remember the name of the town. This was the first step in my decision to explore my silent past.  
  
I had plenty of time on my hands, so I could easily spare a day for this. And I did.  
  
Inside the house, there was a warm and cozy atmosphere. The wooden floors had aged gracefully, bearing the intimacy of years, and each floorboard seemed to witness the memories from our family's past. The old woven carpets cushioned every step, carrying the imprints of the years spent in this house.  
  
In the middle of the living room, there was a large fireplace. It had witnessed my father's stories, my mother warming us, and the many warm moments shared with my sibling. The family photographs on the fireplace served as a reminder of the passage of time.  
  
The walls of our home were like the pages of our family album. Pictures and paintings were fragments that told the story of our family. My sibling's portrait, my father's favorite instrument, my mother's handmade quilts... Everything was a reflection of what had happened in this house.  
  
I ascended the attic stairs, and the wooden steps creaked gently. In the attic, there were old items collected over the years. Dusty boxes, worn-out furniture, and forgotten toys... But my goal was to find something more special.  
  
My memory book was the most valuable treasure containing memories of my childhood. It was a result of my desire to trace the beautiful days I had experienced in the town. 

I had lost it the day before leaving the town and found it under a walnut tree about two hours later. I couldn't leave without it. This book contained what I had written about the friendships and events in that town. I couldn't leave without it. As I wandered in the attic, I carefully searched through each box.

Finally, in a dusty corner, I found an old wooden chest. I opened the lid of the chest and among the old items inside, I found my memory book. The cover of the memory book was covered in dust, but its contents were still fresh and vivid.  
  
I took the memory book in my hands and began to flip through its pages. I recognized my handwriting, a mix of cursive and print, just as I used to write back then, and even the darned "**koes**" term was there.

"**Koes**" was a term I had coined, meaning "**silly**." This was my memory book, containing the memories of my childhood and helping me relive the days spent in the town. As I read, I saw the name of the town in the memory book. 

Yes, I remembered it correctly. It was the town of **Xtrees**. With the joy of solving the mystery, I continued reading the memory book, but as I read my memories, I began to sense that something was amiss.  
  
The first strange memory within my memories was about a summer day by the lake with my friends. As I read that memory, I started to relive that day.  
  
The sun was shining, and the waters of the lake promised coolness and adventure. My friends and I gathered on the sandy shore by the lake to enjoy the day. 

We built sandcastles together, played pranks, and laughed until our stomachs hurt.  
  
At this point in my recollection, I noticed a discrepancy between my own memories and what was written in the memory book.

 In my own version, all of my friends had been frolicking in the water for hours, and we had returned home in the late afternoon. But in the memory book... it was different.  
  
In the memory book, it narrated Tiffany's entry into the water in a strange and inexplicable manner. She had silently stepped into the water and then disappeared into the deep.

 The rest of us had panicked and returned to the shore, eventually going home, but Tiffany never came back.  
  
This discrepancy sent a chill down my spine. It was not as I had remembered it, and this strange change piqued my curiosity even more. 

I was determined to continue reading the other memories because I wanted to learn more about this town and its secrets.  
  
As I turned the page to the next memory, I encountered even more mystery than before. This memory was about Tiffany. About her disappearance.

 I tried to recall that memory in my mind, but there was no trace of such an event in my own memories.  
  
In the memory book, it described the day Tiffany went missing.

 I was asking my parents about what had happened to Tiffany, and they were inquiring about who Tiffany was, claiming they didn't know her. It was as if Tiffany had never existed.  
  
In my own memories, I remembered hanging out with Tiffany countless times, playing games, sliding down the slide, going to McDonald's together, and many other moments.

 But according to the memory book, Tiffany had disappeared. Tiffany's existence was a definite reality for me, but the memory book was saying something else.  
  
This contradiction filled me with dread. I was beginning to realize that something was not right.

I needed more information to understand the depth of this memory book. It was incredibly mysterious and was distorting my perception of reality.  
  
As I moved on to another memory, I was transported to the time of New Year's. In this memory, it was written about the joy and excitement of the town's Christmas celebrations.

 In my memories, I recalled going to Tom's house, where all our friends gathered for a wonderful Christmas party. We danced, told jokes, and exchanged gifts.

 I even remembered how Chris had stolen Tom's chocolates and how all of us had gathered to take them back from Chris. Those memories brought a smile to my face.

However, in the pages of the memory book, this New Year's memory was told in an entirely different way. Instead of the innocent Christmas party at Tom's house, there was something completely different.  
  
In the memory book, I was describing the brutal murder of Tom and his family, and how the police had arrived at the crime scene. 

My family had learned about the incident from the neighbors. The police and the town's elders had gathered, discussing the killer, and I had learned all this by secretly eavesdropping on my parents' late-night conversations.  
  
But such an event had never occurred. On that day, no such event had taken place, and it was not in my memory. 

In my memory, Tom and my other friends had gathered at that house to eat, have fun, and play games.

 However, the memory book contained a different and nauseating narrative, and this writing had deeply affected me.  
  
As I wandered between the pages, I read that the police had been unable to find the killer.

 Despite being a part of a town where people lived in fear, I had no recollection of such horrifying events. And the fact that I didn't remember was even more unsettling. What was happening?  
  
These pages of the memory book were completely overturning my sense of reality. 

The gap between the pleasant Christmas celebrations we had experienced in the past and this horrifying event was making the mysteries of the memory book and the town even more complex. I needed to understand what was going on and uncover this horrifying truth.  
  
After these memories, my fear and curiosity grew even stronger.

 Each page brought more questions and more concerns, but I was not willing to give up on solving these mysteries.  
  
The next memory told the story of the colorful ice cream truck that came to our town. Children scattered in excitement, running to the truck to get their favorite ice creams. However, I was down with fever that day and couldn't go outside.

 Amid the melancholy caused by my illness, I watched from the window as my friends eagerly waited in line for ice cream.  
  
In my memories, I visualized my friends getting ice cream for me and bringing it home, and we would enjoy it together in the backyard while joking and savoring the taste of summer.

They visited Aly after me, as she was also sick. That's how I remembered it.  
  
But in the memory book, it described something entirely different. It said that all the children who had gone to the ice cream truck had disappeared. Despite the search efforts of those around, there was no trace of them.  
  
With a sense of dread, I turned the page and encountered a horrifying revelation.  
  
According to the memory book, when night fell, my family had been watching the news on television. I had secretly tried to watch it from the living room.

 The news on the television channel reported that the missing children had been found dead, frozen in the deep freezer of a nearby factory. This news had shaken me to my core. The warm summer day I remembered had turned into a dark and cold tragedy.

 The memory book was indicating that these horrifying events had indeed taken place in the town, and I was preparing myself to read more memories.  
  
I want to tell you something about Aly. Aly... she was a beautiful girl. Sweet and like-minded. She was more like a kindred spirit among the girls in our group. 

After the ice cream incident, we became a couple months later. One night, as we were returning from the local cinema, she separated me from the group and confessed her feelings for me in a private setting.

I told her that I had feelings for her too, even though I didn't have any romantic attachment to her. We were just at an age where we thought it was cool to be in a relationship, so I became her boyfriend.  
  
When I turned to the next page, I came across a memory that was claimed to have happened between Aly and me. However, I didn't remember this event. The memory book recounted events between Aly and me.

After the tragic events, Aly and I had been left feeling a sense of emptiness. According to the memory book, one day Aly told me that she would be moving away from the town and wanted to share this with me.

With tears in her eyes, she confessed that she had loved me for so long and wanted to admit it. I, however, didn't feel a romantic connection with Aly; I saw her as a good friend. I didn't say anything to avoid making the situation more complicated and just hugged her.  
  
Later, Aly said, "Goodbye," and left. On the next page, I read that I had learned from my family that Aly and her family had been in a car accident that night and had all lost their lives. Learning the painful truth behind Aly's sudden departure had deeply shaken me.  
  
Aly's sincere confession and her subsequent tragic death had left me with a complex mix of emotions. I couldn't understand her feelings at the time, and witnessing her loss had been heartbreaking.

The memory book was making this painful experience even more difficult as I tried to solve the mysteries of the town. It was a day that had never happened, but... a part of me was deeply affected. I felt a void.  
  
The memory book had recorded the silence of the town, something I didn't remember. According to the memory book, every day at 7 p.m., all sounds in the town would cease, and there would be complete silence until 8 p.m. 

But such a thing had never happened in the village where I lived. In the memory book, I wrote that I could never understand the reason for this silence but didn't question it either. After all, I was a child, and it didn't bother me. The events in the memory book were spiraling out of control.

In the diary, it was written that I had sneaked out of my home without my family's permission at half-past seven. It also said that I had gone to the town center. 

There, I observed people never talking to each other, and this struck me as strange. Just as I was about to open my mouth to ask someone something, a stranger immediately covered my mouth. I couldn't understand what was happening. 

I tried to scream, but my mouth was held tightly shut. After struggling for about ten minutes, he let me go. It was written that he scolded me, saying, "**What do you think you're doing?!?! Didn't your family teach you what will happen if you speak in the square at 7 o'clock?!?!**".

I was in shock, staring at the man. The man told me, "**Those who speak at 7 o'clock never return, kid! Don't ever forget this! Now, go back home!**" He said this while I was crying, and I ran back home.  
  
Of course, I never remembered this memory, but what was this silence event? With every page I turned, a new mystery unfolded.  
  
When I reached the last page, I started reading the notes at the end of the diary. On the last page, I had written that we were leaving this town and that I would never forget my friends.

This final page felt like a farewell message, and I felt a strange melancholy while reading it.  
  
"*In these last days of leaving this town, memories and losses we left behind occupy my mind. You were my friends who gave me the brightest moments of my life, but this town took you away from me.*

*This diary is proof of the fearful moments we experienced, a way to never forget them. I don't want to forget you, but living with the weight of these memories is getting harder every day. I hope we meet again somewhere else, in a better life. Goodbye, unforgettable friends.*"  
  
The diary was completed, its pages were finished. Suddenly, I felt like I fell into a great void. I started to contemplate the meaning of these memories and events.

Were these events really happening, or were they just a product of my imagination? I knew that these events didn't happen, or at least I remembered they didn't. But why would I make up these stories? These questions occupied my mind for hours.  
  
Finally, I decided that there was only one way to find the answers to these questions: to go to that town. The writings in the diary had revealed the mystery of the town and the strange events that happened there. If I wanted to understand these events and question their reality, I needed to go to the town.  
  
This decision aroused both curiosity and fear within me. Going to the town meant plunging into an unknown mystery, and I didn't know what I would encounter.

But after all that had happened with the diary, I felt that it was time to confront the unknown. I was determined to uncover the town's mystery and started on my journey, ready to face the uncertainties.  
  
Remembering the way to the town was surprisingly easy. Despite the town described in the diary being very different from the one I knew, I somehow remembered the path.

My eyes confirmed it as I arrived at the place where the town should be. It wasn't abandoned, but rather an empty expanse of land. I got out of the car and looked around in shock.

The road was correct, and a sign two kilometers back read "**Sonhoax**." This was the town, the same town.  
  
The only living thing in the town was a large walnut tree rising where the town center should be. It was a massive tree. I approached it and stood in the shade, scanning the surroundings.

I was here to remember what had happened, but now it seemed like nothing had happened at all.  
  
I looked at the trunk of the walnut tree. It seemed rotten, but it was still standing strong.

Then my foot caught on something buried in the soil. It felt like paper. Thinking I needed to dig a bit, I used my hands to unearth it. What I found sent a shiver down my spine.

***It was a world map, but the names of the countries on this map didn't resemble any country names in the world...***
