Born on a warm summer night in june
The boy was born.
The half creek first generation american Named David
Later became the oldest of 4 with 3 younger sisters. 
My father when he was not at work, Drank or was high. He was a kind man but out of his Depth
Never truly content with life. After his older brother, David had died. Is depression let him to be in relationship with a woman who's not mentally sound.
Nameing his only son after his dead brother. He never truly dealt with his grief.

At age six I had My head to cracked open. For the first time. It was my birthday. Me and my friends were building a treehouse.. We only have one hammer, so the birthday boy got to use it.. All of my friends were using rocks.
What are my friends working on the second floor drop the rock about the size of my head down 20 feet on to my head. I don't remember the rest of that day.

After that my mother started abusing me.
It's started with Slaps , verbal abuse.
Later developing into whippings. I would leave my ass bloody and hard to sit down.

When I was 8 I fell off. My bicycle and cracked my head open in our driveway.
I walked up to the house in my mother's slut. Me so hard because I had gotten a hurt and not worn my helmet. That I fell down on our front porch.
If my father was not home, I would have died That day. 

The third time I was jumping with friends off a cliff into a lake that we did often.
I slipped on the rocks. 

At age nine, my mother kidnapped me and my 3 sisters. We went through battered women, shelters and  boyfriends houses. More than once, I had to protect. My sister's and got the shit kicked out Of me for it.. But they were safe. I never experience what I did.

I remember the first place we stayed at on the second night.
The attendant went into my sisters room
I Had the gotton up to go to the bathroom And I saw him.
He heard me turned and shut the door.
I opened it and said to him bixby touch them I'll start screaming.
He grabbed me by The throat practically lifting me off the ground
And we walked into the hallway where he shut the door again.
Punching me very hard in the stomach, knocking the breath out of me but still holding me up with this other hand as a struggled. 
I remember him whispering. "I'll do whatever the fuck I want boy And if you get in my way again, I'll kill you."

I found an old pipe in an alley way
The next night after my sister's went to sleep. I said outside their room all night
He came by.
I stood up and said " if you take one step towards that door. I am swinging. And yelling"

He just smiled and put his finger to his lips and then walked away
That 1st month I slept maybe 4 hours a day and only during the day.

The other shelters were better, although some not as clean.
 She had an apartment for a while. Small one bedroom where I slept in an easy chair.
And then she moved to send with one of her boyfriends
He beat the ever living shit out of me 
But he was smart to Not hit my face or my arms.
He said "if I told my mother about it. Not only would I be buried out back But my sisters would be buried next to me."

Luckily we were not There too long.
My father tracked us down and got a court order for us to return.
Remove back into our old house. My father moved out.
And then my mother took us to another city. But in the same state.

This was when I was twelve

At thirteen I ran away from my mother's house to live with my father
I remember riding my bike through the night for what felt like forever.
The next three years went pretty smoothly
But my 16th year was bad.

This was the year that I was born.
David tried to put the Dune in his mouth and pull the trigger.
Jack pulled the gun out.  It is taken a significant amount of time for Jack to assert his total control.
But he doesn't allow David to do that stupid shit anymore.

My grandparents sold their business. moved from New England to Florida.
2 of my sisters went with them.
My father got cancer

I dropped out of school to take care of him got my ged and started online part time college
The rest of the time I worked

Using a fake id. I got into a fight at a bar. At 17
I was 6 foot an my grandfather. Taught me how to block so I could handle myself. 
The bar tender was a friend of my father's
He knew I was under age. But he also knew everything that I was going through. 
Seeing the way I handled myself. He offered me a job as a bouncer.
After a couple of months and a few more rough situations
The offer funny but this time to fight
That money helps me keep my dad taking care of for a while

After a couple of years he got two sick for me to take care of
I sold his house
Removed from specialized care to hospice
And I was lost. 

I failed. And I could not watch him die
So I left.
He survived and went to Florida.
Taking my car, my travel around the US for a couple of years.
I left before he recovered and I truly regret.

After three months on the road I met a cute hitchhiker
We saw most of canada almost all of the states
I loved her
But she wanted to stay in California. Aso we stayed.
I was able to get a really great deal on a house that was a foreclosure.
And then her family's home Burned

Her brother, Her sister, Her sister's boyfriend and child, And her blind mother had nowhere to go.
I had just enough room. It was a little tight, but we made it work. And it was good for a little while. But then I realized it's not what I wanted

I didn't want to live my life taking care of her family.

I gave her the house and I left again..

I spent another six months on the road before ending up in mexico city
Half way through my 21st year. I had a gun pointed in my face for the first time by someone who I knew would use it.
I had drank too much and played cards with people I should not have
I lost a great deal of money. I did not have or at least that's what they claimed

The man who pointed the gun at me said " You owe me money gringo, You either pay me with cash body parts or a job."
My drunk ass. Could only think of one thing when it came to job and that was blowjob
I blame the liquid strength when I responded.
" You can go ahead and shoot me. I'm not going to suck your Dick."

When he left, his friends laughed.
And then he put away his gun and he said. "No, you're going to run drugs for me."

I shrugged and agreed

I do not know what was loaded in my trunk and i'd never want to know.
Play, they put so much weight in it.
It was lower down on the Springs.
Hand to God. The only reason I made it through that Border crossing was some old guy with smoking a joint a couple Cars down
 they didn't pay any attention to the white boy.
I do not know if he was planted by the cartel or it was simple coincidence.

My dropped off the shipment did not watch them unload.
I was handed ten thousand dollars and told 
" You did good, We normally pay our couriers more. One more job and you are square."

I smiled and said "just let me know when"

That very day. I took the Passport that I had been given as a fake ID.
Along with my real one.
Sold, my car, took all of my money.
And fucked off to Russia..

I spent the next 2 years traveling. Surround all the places that I had wanted to see.
When I needed to work. It was not hard for me to find the work.

I had a lot of fun and i'm not gonna tell you all of the things that happened but  One of the more notable ones was me dying in 3 different countries.

The first time I struck by lightning in russia
In Thailand, I don't know what it was. But it wasn't Coke.
And increase when swimming I got hit in the head with a surf board

I don't remember ever seeing anything on the other side.

When I was twenty four I came back to the states because I was home sick

And when I Got back i realized. I didn't have a home to return to.

I got a job that I didn't really care for but it was easy and I made good money.
A drank too much spending about a year in the bottle
Easy to do when you can do your job drunk.
I was just as lost as when I began my journey

And then I met a woman.
Second time in my life that I've fallen in love.

To me she was beautiful. I don't know if others would consider her the same.
Three months after we started dating she lost her job
Face homelessness with her autistic four-year-old son.
So I gave up my shitty appointment and I stopped Drinking for a while I moved in.
Eventually, we got married since she had my son.

Cut forward through all the bad that happened in that relationship.
My mental health was slipping.
I had put her through nursing school. And we decided that I should take a break for a while.

So I became a stay-at-home. Dad, something I never wanted to be. And I realize she was just shoving me in the corner so that she could Live her dream 
I became severely depressed and I gained a significant amount of weight
At five hundred and twenty pounds my wife accused me of abuse
Something that I have never done to a woman

I had no recollection of it and thought I'd finally snapped 
I went for a stay at mental health hospital.
And while I was in, she went to the police with charges.
She had no bruises and this was confirmed by doctors.
All she had was her story. And I couldn't even keep reality straight.

It was not hard for her to take everything from me
The house that I had Earned for us.
We did not have an insignificant savings.
And someone who I thought was my best friend is now her lover

Because of my mental health, it was not hard for her to take the rights to my son away from me.

And when I was finally out of the mental hospital. I was homeless with the only the clothes on my back.

I went to Live it a homeless shelter. I was lucky to find a bed.
And I work as much as humanly possible 
My forced my sleeping habits to change from now. Any more than 6 hours, I can't sleep.
I got a car and then I was homeless in a car

It is now five years later

Oper last few years I have had several places to live
I've lost everything just to gain it back again
I usually find it pretty easy to make money where I go

Hello my name is Jack 
I left a lot out of my story.
There are spots in my memory. I just can't breach.
Another parts
Are to dark for the telling.
