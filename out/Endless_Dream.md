I woke up one morning, just like any other day. The sunlight filtered through my curtains, casting a warm glow on my bedroom walls. I stretched, yawned, and rubbed my eyes, ready to start the day. I went through my usual routine – brushing my teeth, taking a shower, and making breakfast. Everything felt so ordinary, yet there was an eerie sense of déjà vu lingering in the air.

As I stepped outside, the world seemed oddly quiet. The usual sounds of birds chirping and cars passing by were absent. I walked down the empty streets, my footsteps echoing in the silence. A feeling of dread washed over me, but I couldn't quite put my finger on why.

I went about my day, interacting with people who seemed familiar yet distant, as if I had met them in a half-remembered dream. I tried to shake off the strange sensation, attributing it to mere fatigue or stress. But as the day wore on, reality began to warp around me.

Every time I glanced in a mirror, my reflection seemed to waver, as if it was trying to escape its glassy prison. I touched objects, feeling their texture beneath my fingertips, yet doubting their existence. The boundary between dream and reality blurred, leaving me in a perpetual state of confusion.

Night fell, and exhaustion washed over me. I crawled into bed, hoping that sleep would bring clarity to this surreal experience. As I closed my eyes, I expected to wake up in the familiar confines of my bedroom.

But I didn't.

Instead, I found myself trapped in another dream, living out another day in a never-ending loop of waking and sleeping. Each day became a twisted version of the one before, with subtle differences that only I could perceive. I pleaded for release, for an escape from this nightmarish cycle, but my cries fell on deaf ears.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months. I lost count of how long I had been imprisoned within this endless dream. The line between my waking life and the dream world became indistinguishable. I couldn't remember who I was anymore, or if I had ever truly existed outside of this haunting illusion.

I became a ghost in my own consciousness, a mere spectator in the distorted reality that surrounded me. The people I encountered, the places I visited – they were all fragments of my imagination, taunting me with their familiarity. I longed for the sensation of true awakening, the feeling of cold air against my skin and the certainty of being alive.

But it never came.

And so, I remain trapped in this never-ending nightmare, a prisoner of my own subconscious. Forever waking up in the morning, going through the motions of life, only to realize that it's all just a dream. A cruel illusion that mocks the very essence of my existence.

I am lost in the darkness of my mind, suspended between the realms of wakefulness and slumber. And as the cycle continues, I am haunted by the terrifying possibility that I may never truly wake up again.
