I don’t think I’ve had a proper night of sleep ever since this happened. And truthfully, I don’t think I ever will.

Six years ago, I died in the stupidest way possible.

There’s a lake of sorts located in the outskirts of my town. The day that I died was a particularly chilly day, so the lake was frozen solid. My two best friends (who I now refuse to talk to) dared me to walk across the frozen lake. Doing so would result in them paying me a hefty amount of forty dollars. I was twelve at the time, so you know damn well that I didn’t think twice about this.

So, there I was right after school. Walking across the frozen lake. Truth be told, it didn’t seem like a bad idea at the time. Walking on the ice felt like walking on concrete. Then again, my friends were cheering me on the whole time, so I really couldn’t hear the cracks that came from the ice.

You can imagine how mortified I was when the ice collapsed.

My heart stopped due to the sudden drop in temperature. And in that moment, the world faded away into the brightest shade of white. Just pure white. I tried holding my hands up to my face, but I couldn’t do so at all. In fact, I wasn’t even inside my body at all. As the spiritual people say, all that was left of me was a big ball of light known as ‘my soul’.

“You’re here early.” A voice muttered.

Who this voice belonged to, I’ll never know. Was it God? Eh, I doubt it. Was it an angel? Mmm, maybe. But irregardless, this voice was deep and commanding, echoing throughout the entire void. It came from everywhere yet nowhere at the same time.

“Who are you?” I gasped.

“Oh, I really shouldn’t say,” The Voice spoke. “See, you’re here about a few decades early. But that’s okay. That’s fine. Because fourteen minutes and twenty one seconds from now, a cocky ER doctor will bring you back to life. Your mother will hold you in her arms, and your father will cry for the first time in over fifteen years. Your friends will visit you in the hospital, but you won’t really want them there. No! You’ll just curse them out for three minutes straight. You won’t go back to school until next Wednesday, and when you do go back, your biology teacher will give you a very nice box of chocolates. Very nice indeed.”

The Voice spoke as if these events had already occurred.

“How do you know all of this?” I asked.

“Because I planned all of it,” The Voice answered. “I planned for you to wear Nike sneakers today, and I planned for you to grow an interest in The Olympics. You’re a very good athlete right now, so I can already see that that decision has paid off very well.”

“So, you planned out every part of my life?” I stuttered.

“Even the parts that you don’t think about.” The voice answered.

“So you planned out every argument that I’ve had with my mom?” I asked, horrified.

“And I planned out every insult that you called her.” The Voice answered.

“And you also planned out who I would be friends with?” I asked, angrily.

“Yep.”

‘Shocked’ is a very subtle way of describing how I felt. But as The Voice continued to speak, I couldn’t help but think of just one more question.

“Well,” I said. “If I’m not going to die today, then what’s going to happen when I actually die?”

“Oh, when you *actually* die?” The Voice asked. “Well, the answer is actually quite simple. You’ll be reincarnated as yourself, born in the same year and everything, and I’ll just change another decision of yours. Maybe instead of planning for you to grow an interest in The Olympics, I’ll have you grow an interest in Charles Dickens. Or maybe I’ll have you grow an interest in The Titanic. Or maybe I won’t even change that. Maybe I’ll change where you sat on your first day of Kindergarten. Or maybe I’ll change what bus route you use to go to work.”

Bus routes? Charles Dickens? Kindergarten? Seriously?

“Why does that even matter?” I asked.

“Because it all impacts your future.” The Voice bellowed. “In your previous life, you chose to oversleep on a Sunday morning, which caused you to miss a flight that ended up crashing into the ocean. In the life before that, you woke up right on time. And in the life before that, you never even had to go on any flight, because I chose for you to have aerophobia.”

“Every decision counts.” The Voice concluded.

And the shade of bright white faded away, allowing me to watch my father as he uncontrollably cried.
