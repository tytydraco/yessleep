Just a year ago, I was at rock bottom. And not like I fell to the bottom — no, I had firmly settled there, clutching a bottle of whiskey with a divorce and job termination behind me. The divorce papers were stained with cigarette ash and wine glass rings. No friends from work remained. Everything I had amounted to nothing. I drank all day — for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I didn’t even eat. I didn’t care. I drowned in debt and absolute depression. I often thought about ending it all. Pills, a razor blade, or a noose — I simply wondered which would be quicker and easier, but never followed through.

The day the nightmare began, I was walking through the rain to the liquor store, and something terrible found me on the way. It was a simple flyer, soaked through and plastered to a lamppost like a moth to glass.

"Wanna try your luck?"
That’s all it said, along with a phone number.

I smirked, but something inside urged me to call. As I dialed, I told myself it was just for a laugh — but looking back, I think I truly was reaching for any kind of help. The call was answered on the second ring. No voice. Nothing. Just static. I tried to speak, but no one responded. I hung up and laughed bitterly.

After spending nearly my last dollars on booze, I stumbled home, tossed my coat to the floor, and lost myself in bourbon. In the morning, I drank to remember. In the evening, to forget.

And then it happened.

My bedroom door creaked open with a long, eerie moan that made my heart plummet. I never left it open. I turned, and from the bedroom stepped something — slowly, rhythmically clicking its heels. A man, maybe thirty, dressed like a corpse from the 19th century: tailcoat, vest with tarnished copper buttons, black leather gloves, and golden wristwatch. But none of it mattered — because his head... his head was turned completely around. Along with his face.

His skin was taut and smooth, unnaturally stretched. His chin sat where his forehead should be. Bulging brown eyes stared from upside-down sockets like marbles, and his crooked smile revealed yellow teeth. Filthy hair clung to his neck. He tossed a silver coin in one hand, catching it with dirt-caked nails. I screamed, pressing myself against the wall. My entire body crawled with terror. I could barely breathe.

“You called,” he whispered.

His mouth barely moved. He kept tossing the damn coin every second.
“Who are you?” I choked, gasping in fear.
“A Player. We can play a game — one that will change your life. Generous rewards... and brutal losses.”

I don’t know what I was thinking. Maybe I believed it was a drunken hallucination, maybe I’d lost my mind — but I agreed. And oh, how wrong I was. It was real. But back then, I had nothing left to lose. That’s when he laid out the rules.

“Heads, and you stay alive — with a chance to win in future games and earn rewards. Tails... and I take your life. Right here, right now.”

My lips moved before my mind caught up. I agreed. He flipped the coin — and time slowed. I saw it twirl, silver like the moon.
Heads.
“We’ll meet again, winner.”
He smiled faintly and disappeared into my bedroom. When I rushed to check, the room was empty. My knees buckled with fear and confusion. But it was only the beginning.

The first few days were normal. I drank and smoked from morning till night. By the third day, I had no money left. The fourth morning, I stood at a crosswalk, eyes bloodshot, staring at the red light. That’s when I heard it — like a knife to the back.

“Heads — and you’ll cross safely. Tails — you’ll die under a car.”

My heart froze. I turned. There he was — smiling, flipping the coin between his fingers. I begged him not to, but his smile widened, revealing yellowed fangs. He flipped the coin.

Heads.

I crossed. In the grass on the other side, I found an envelope. Inside: twenty thousand dollars. I burst into tears, then laughter. I couldn’t describe the madness surging through me — hysteria, holding that envelope in shaking hands.

I paid off my debts. Cleaned my apartment for the first time in months. Nearly stopped drinking. How I wished it had ended there. But now I know — that first coin toss wasn’t a game. It was a contract.

A week later, I was brushing my teeth when I heard a snap behind me.

“Heads — your tooth cracks. Tails — no cavities to worry about.”

Coin flips.
Heads.

I saw it split in the mirror — the pain was blinding. I crawled, bleeding, to the dentist. And after that, he came more often. Wherever I went — elevator, car, street — he was there. Tossing the coin. Each toss shaped my day.

I slipped in public and broke my nose. Found wallets full of cash. Met stunning women who seemed programmed to fall into my bed. A streak of tiny wins. A parade of tiny losses. One morning, I didn’t wake up naturally — I awoke to him standing over me.

“Heads — the stock market bows before you. Tails — you lose everything.”

Heads.
I made a fortune. Bought my dream home, car — lived carefree. He appeared only to toss the coin. I kept winning. Maybe luck was with me... or maybe he wanted me to win.

One coin toss later, I had a girlfriend. Then a wife. Her laughter was like bells. Her eyes — oceanic.

“Heads — she’ll give you beautiful children. Tails — she dies in her sleep.”

He said it one night, standing by our bed.

I couldn’t speak. Tails.

She never woke up.

The stakes grew. He became constant. When he wasn’t physically there, he appeared in puddles, windows, mirrors — smiling, flipping his coin. I’d turn — nothing. My house emptied. I should have grieved, but I had just won another game — and lost my love for her.

Otherwise, I’d have spiraled into depression again.

Money flowed in and out. Then I lost — and got lung cancer. I heard him chuckle as I coughed blood. Another toss: both legs shattered with a grotesque snap. One win healed me — the cancer vanished. Another loss would’ve given me dementia.

Even winning stopped bringing joy. All I felt was fear — fear of him coming back to toss the monstrous coin again. Losses began outweighing wins. I stopped shaving — what if a toss said I’d slit my throat? I stopped bathing, stopped doing anything. He didn’t care. He came anyway.

He stepped from my closet, silver coin blackened and stained.

“Heads — you go blind in one eye. Tails — in both.”

I screamed, begged him to stop, said I’d give up everything. He listened... then flipped.

Heads. I went blind in my left eye. 

Before my eye surgery, lying on the table, I saw him on a chair beside me. He whispered:

“Heads — a surgical error takes your hearing. Tails — you die on the operating table.”

Terror froze me. I wept. “That’s not fair,” I whispered.

He flipped. Heads.

I’m half-blind. Completely deaf. My heart pounds. Sweat pours constantly. I can’t sleep — when I do, he’s there. When I’m awake, he’s still there.

He no longer appears in reflections — he just sits beside me, silently mirroring my every move. A man with a backward head, draining my life with each second. No words can describe the horror of being near him. I tried to shoot myself — heads, the gun didn’t fire. Tried to hang myself — heads, the rope snapped just in time.

Then he vanished for a whole day.

Only to reappear at dawn, sitting on my windowsill, head tilted grotesquely upward, driving a finger into his chest. With his blood, he wrote on my wall:

“Tomorrow, 7:00 AM — final game. Heads — you die quickly, painlessly. Tails — you’ll scream as loud as you can... until you die.”

I begged. Sobbed. Screamed without hearing myself. With my one working eye, I saw him grinning, enjoying it, as he vanished again.

I’m typing this now, watching the clock. It’s 6:53 AM.
