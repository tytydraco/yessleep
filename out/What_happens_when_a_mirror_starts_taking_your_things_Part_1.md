So, I’ve started to notice strange things with my mirror. It’s kinda hard to explain, so I think I should just go back to where it all started.

Yesterday, I went to the weekly yard sales in the neighborhood. It’s a small, old neighborhood, full of houses built in the 70’s, with plenty of elderly folks to fill them. I live near the edge of the neighborhood, close to the college, so during these yard sales, we get tons of poor college students looking for things of value or things they can use. I for one, always go for the valuable stuff. With all the old people around, you never know what you’re going to find—old golf clubs, coin collections, sometimes even old video games if you’re lucky. The kind of stuff you’d find in a grandparent’s basement.

As I walked my usual route, I stopped by Mr. Robinson’s house. He’s an elderly fellow with thinning brown hair, glasses, a trimmed mustache, and a tall stature with a slight hunch—exactly the kind of kind old man you’d see at church. He always enjoyed seeing me. 

“Hey there, Jake,” he said, smiling.

I always stop by to chat with him. He saves things for me in case I might want them. “Got some baseball cards here for ya,” he said. “Not sure if any are valuable, but there might be some goodies in there.”

“No thanks,” I said. “I still haven’t gone through the last set you gave me.” 

He chuckled and asked if I was still busy with work. I told him I’d been up all night doing commissions, but it didn’t stop me from coming out for the yard sales. I waved goodbye and kept going.

That’s when I noticed something unusual: a new person was setting up a yard sale. On this street, you usually get the same few sellers—Mr. Robinson, Mrs. Parker, Mrs. Grey, and Mr. Thomson—but today, it looked like Mr. Graham was having his own sale.

Mr. Graham is another older guy, a bit stout, with short gray hair, a rough beard, and a sunken face. He uses a cane, and whenever I see him, he’s usually sitting on his porch. I walked up to his table, and he was shuffling things around, setting them up.

“Hey there, you’re John, right?” he asked.

“Uh, Jake,” I corrected him.

“Oh, my bad. I hear you talking to the other neighbors when I’m out on the porch. Must’ve misheard.”

I told him it was fine and asked why he was selling his stuff. 

“Well, I’m not. I’m giving it away—for free,” he said. “I’m moving down to Florida to live with my daughter, and I figured I’d just get rid of the stuff I don’t need.”

I told him that was nice of him and asked what he was giving away. On the table, there wasn’t much—just some dining room decor and old clothes. But in the center of it all was a mirror. About 3 inches by 6 inches. It immediately caught my eye, not that there was much else to look at.

The mirror looked old. The glass was dusty, and some of the edges were banged up, but otherwise, it seemed fine.

“You want the mirror?” Mr. Graham asked, almost the moment I looked at it.

I wiped the dust off with my hand, and Mr. Graham spoke again, more insistent this time. “You touched it, didn’t you? You clearly want it. Go ahead, take it.”

Shrugging off his strange behavior, I picked it up. “Thanks, are you sure you don’t want anything for it?”

“Nah, I just want it gone, like the rest of this stuff. Trust me, take it.”

He smiled, but there was something else in his eyes. It wasn’t just kindness—he seemed almost... relieved. I didn’t know what to make of it. Maybe the mirror gave him bad memories or something. He’s old, a war vet, and I don’t really understand what that kind of life can do to someone. Maybe it was just one of those things.

When I got back home, I hung the mirror up on my closet door in my bedroom. By then, it was around 8:00 p.m., so I sat down to work on my art commissions. I was drawing for hours, probably until midnight, when I finally decided to call it a night and go to bed.

I woke up at around 2 a.m. to the sound of footsteps. At first, I thought it was just the house settling. These old houses do that sometimes, especially in the cold, and it was October after all. But these footsteps sounded louder, closer. Still, I chalked it up to being tired and tried to go back to sleep.

That’s when I noticed the closet door in the mirror—it was open. I never leave it open, especially not when I’m sleeping. I turned around to check, but in reality, the door was closed. I looked back at the mirror, and this time the reflection showed the door closed too. 

I didn’t know whether I was just seeing things, but after that shock, it took a while for me to fall asleep again.

Today, things got even stranger. When I woke up, I went to the mirror to get ready, and when I reached behind me for my shirt, it wasn’t there. But in the mirror, I could see it, hanging on the back of my chair like always. 

I turned around—no shirt. Only in the mirror did it appear. 

That just happened about an hour ago, and honestly, I’m not sure what’s going on. Maybe I’m still tired, or maybe this mirror is just... off. Either way, I’ll keep you posted if anything else happens.
