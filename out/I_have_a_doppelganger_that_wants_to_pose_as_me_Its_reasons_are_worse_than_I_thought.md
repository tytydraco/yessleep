Imagine having to sleep knowing there’s something watching you. As you casually go about your daily routines, your every move, activity, is observed down to the most micro of gestures. When it appears like you’re alone, but there’s something lurking, salivating at every detail of your body.

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/109bgs4/when_im_gone_for_work_something_happens_in_my/) will fill you in if you’re not caught up, but for a basic rundown: I was told by a guy who claimed to be a supernatural investigator that the best course of action for handling the doppelganger attempting to copy my life, was for me to live with it. It's nauseating. Nonstop looks over my shoulder, eye twitching all day, and sleep deprived. I’d made constant attempts at messaging Yoel. They were delivered, but never opened. After we were done collaborating for the two previous installments of this story, he’d been completely ghosting me ever since. I saw he had already posted them.

Was beginning to think that this fuckin' asshole really did use and abandon me. In terms of anymore standout, odd occurrences with my doppelganger, or “Mimic,” it was a little strange how calm my house was.

My Mimic seemed to improve itself on how much it, well, was able to mimic me. Over a shy of two weeks, I’d come home to see less and less sloppiness from how I left it. Actually, when I say “improve,” I mean, really improve. For example: I only had a single roll of paper towels in my house. Made a mental note to get more on my day off. Next day, however, I came home to a twelve casing of paper towels sitting in the closet used for storing everyday appliances.

“Neat,” I thought. And that was only the beginning. If I had a lack of food in my freezer, or my laundry needed to be done, all that would be taken care of. My rugs had clear signs of being thoroughly vacuumed every day. Whenever mold builds up in crevasses and corners around the house—be it the bathroom or the kitchen—consider it done. These are things I’d top off, but if I was feeling slightly lazy and neglected it, my Mimic would get it first during its day, while I was gone. How? Who the fuck knows.

Don’t mistake this for comfortability. This was still a violation of my privacy. Although having a little helper was nice on paper, to have a pair of eyes on you 24/7 eats away at the psyche. I jump awake every couple of hours of sleeping, feeling a presence at awe over me, studying me. I was to “act as natural as possible,” but damn was that tough. It ain’t normal for me to sleep with the light on, but I can’t help myself. There’s no way I can be in total darkness with that thing. Not being able to see it was the worst part.

Early morning—today, which is my day off, I’m doing dishes when my phone pings. It’s a message from an unknown number. I dry my hands off and open it.

It’s Yoel. “David, it’s your new best friend. I’m about to call your ass. DON’T put me on speaker. Wear ear buds if you have any. Go into your car, drive around your neighborhood or something. Tell me when you're ready.”

Finally. I turned the sink off, grabbed my keys, and did exactly what he told me. By the time I get out of the driveway, I'm in a facetime call with him.

The camera view was opposite his face. He seemed to be in bed, in his pajamas, reading some kind of book. “David, buddy, how you been? How’s the new roomie? He’s paying his half of the rent?”

“Practically. Where the fuck have you been?” I said. “Why are you calling me from a completely different number?”

“Listen, sunshine, you’re not my only client. I’m busy. In any case, I got into some shenanigans and had to ditch my old number. Common practice in this business. But enough about that, I’ve got some things to tell ya, friend.”

“Like how to get rid of the Mimic?” I hastened a response.

Couldn’t see his face but could tell he smirked.

“The ‘Mimic.’ Look at you,” he said. “Someone’s started to believe. I’ve done a lot of research, David. It’s been driving me nuts, but I have a good idea of how this thing operates.”

“Hey, before you get to that, I have a question," I interrupted. "You said you knew that it hasn’t been a long time since this thing has been around me. How could you tell?”

“Excellent question. I love that. This is the kind of thinking that’s gonna keep you in the race,” Yoel said. He briefly pulls out another book, the same book he had at my sister’s house. “This manuscript here is an anthology collection on a variety of different entities. Not incredibly thorough of each one, however.”

“Your point?” I said, trading glances between the road ahead and what he's trying to show me.

“It means its contents are limited. Especially in terms of the knowledge that would be of use to us in combatting said forces. From it, I’m able to identify your issue, know a superficial level of the subject’s behavior, and ultimately what it can lead too. This is why I needed time to gather info, you see? But from what I was able to gather from this first book, was that if a Mimic were to kill their lover, it’s not totally without warning.”

My car skirted to the side as my grip on the wheel waned. “Wait, what? You sayin’ this thing is going to fucking kill me? I thought it just wanted to copy me?”

“Listen carefully to what I’m about to tell you,” Yoel said. He flips through the pages before pointing at some illustrations. “In the 1670’s, there was a painter in Strasbourg France named Charles Le Franc II. An underrated, unknown, master of the arts. Often described as optimistic, cheerful, and talkative. Able to etch a laugh onto anyone’s face in a conversation. One day, he began to gossip in his town that there was something mysterious happening in his home. He said that one time, he came back home after a long day and saw another portrait standing aside his original one. It’s unknown how Charles reacted to this, but he left it there. He would finish a particular piece the next morning and leave for the day. Upon returning home, the other portrait stand had a painting on it. However, it was a mess of colors, barely coherent.”

“Where is this goin’?” I asked.

“Shut up. Listen. He’d continue to bring up the odd occurrence to his acquaintances and even strangers, but no one believed him. Every day he came home, the second portrait would have more defined features. Eventually, he must’ve realized these rough etchings were meant to look like whatever painting he currently worked on. Sounds familiar, David? Imagine a beautiful canvas, magnificent rays of sunshine bounced off a mountainous horizon, with a river flowing down from the peak of the terrain. Now, imagine a kindergartener attempting to copy it with a crayon.”

“I reckon the dummy painting kept getting better with each passing attempt?” I said.

“Precisely. And eventually…”

“The copy was perfect,” I finished his sentence.

“Beautiful,” he said, flipping the page. “Soon after which, something changed in Charles. He complained to his mother of horrific nightmares he was having. He said there was something in the dark, stalking, hiding in the confines of his peripheral. It got to a point where he then spent several weeks without being seen. He’d refuse to leave the house. When Charles eventually stepped back outside after a month, his peers noticed his mannerisms and behavior were distant. He was awkward, tried too hard with his enthusiasm, and forced quips. His critics documented his paintings to have become significantly terrible, and Charles was rejected by every single one of them. To make a long story short: he was found in his home hanging from the ceiling weeks later.”

“That escalated quickly,” I said. “But I get what you’re tryin’ to say. He was haunted by a Mimic, but he killed himself because of it?”

“David. He didn’t kill himself. Remember what I told you? The primary motivation of a Mimic is love. The more time it spends around you, the more that love festers into an obsession. Typically, its desire will evolve for it to want to become you. It’ll replace you entirely.”

He punctuated his sentence by closing the book.

I was stuck in a limbo of shock and pulled over to grasp it all.

Yoel must’ve sensed the awkward silence. “Don’t panic. In your sister’s house, I asked if you were experiencing nightmares, or seeing figures in the corners of your eyes. You said no. Is that still the case?”

I didn’t speak.

“David,” he snapped.

I rubbed my eyes. “Yeah. I’ve been having nightmares. Then again, I can hardly sleep at night.”

“I see…” Yoel said. He paused for a moment. “So, it’s begun the beginning stages of its haunting. It’s giving into its urge of wanting to replace you. It’s odd how it’s progressing so quickly, though. The stories here detail events taking place over several months. In your case, it’s already began its final stages.”

“There’s something I should tell you,” I said. Began telling him about my experiences with the Mimic out-performing me in terms of how to take care of my own house.

Yoel got silent, pensive. “So…you’re saying it’s thinking ahead of you? Not just copying? . . . Oh dear.”

“What? What is it?” I asked.

Another awkward silence ensued. The facetime was reduced to a standard call.

Yoel chucked, but it felt a little forced. “Look, my friend, either way, it’s well documented that Mimics can have different personalities and different levels of proficiencies. To elucidate, let’s take Charles for example: the book interprets his death by suicide to not have been the original version of him. When Charles was complaining to his mother about his terrors, that’s when the Mimic had begun haunting him. However, when those who knew Charles noted a change in behavior when he eventually returned to the outside world, the Mimic had already killed and replaced him by then. It was the Mimic disguised as him, talking with his peers, painting the works that were rejected by critics.”

“Okay, this particular Mimic was shit at its job, then,” I said.

“Exactly,” Yoel responded. “Most Mimics aren’t the brightest creatures. Even when it’s ‘reading’ your books, it’s most likely pretending to understand what’s on the pages—an excuse to copy your mannerisms. Remember what I said earlier about ‘channeling’? If a Mimic is too hasty and kills its lover without properly downloading them to completion, it’ll get stuck once it decides to discard you. You might say: depressed. It won’t know what to do with itself. As those closest to you began to distance themselves from your changes in behavior, when it’s not able to convincingly be you to the world, its will to live shatters. Truth be told, a Mimic doesn’t even have to materialize itself to pose as you. It helps the bonding process, but it isn’t vital for the replacement to merely happen.”

I was on the verge of hyperventilating. “How the fuck do we stop this from happening then, Yoel? Just give me a solution. Please.”

“It’s gonna be okay, alright? I’ve been telling you all this because the context is necessary. Our solution to this is simpler than you think. David, according to what I’ve gathered, all we must do is simply ask it to stop.”

I took deep breaths. “Ask it to stop?”

Yoel continued. “Precisely. In person, there’s no real way to confront it without the risk of angering it. There’s a resolution to this caveat. Something’s coming your way. In a few hours from now, a crew I hired is going to come to your house. They'll wiretap and put live-recording apparatuses all throughout your home. After this phone call, I want you to extract whatever necessary belongings and leave your house before they get there. It shouldn’t take more than a few hours, so think of something time consuming to do.”

I was flabbergasted. “You want me to sit-on back and let a group of total strangers sent by another total stranger to invade my home? What the fuck, man. We could have at least had a conversation about this beforehand."

“Touché,” Yoel said. “Let’s be fair, though. Ideally, I would’ve liked to have had this kind of setup in your home this entire time. An entire week’s worth of footage between a Mimic and its chosen host would have been incredible. But you barely trusted me when I met you, so there’s no way you would’ve agreed to it.”

“Yeah, and there’s no way in hell I can go another week with this thing, so you’re shit outta luck,” I said.

“Bummer. What a waste. But considering you’re saying the nightmares have started, I guess it’s for the best.”

‘I guess,’ huh? My blood was boiling by his nonchalance. “What’s even the point of all this, man? And what if the Mimic is there when the camera crew are? They'll be in danger."

“They'll be fine” he said. “The Mimic will likely not know how to react and will simply stay dematerialized. It's a change in behavior for what goes on in your home, but it's an outlier. I don't even think it could hurt them if it wanted to.”

"So, what's the point of me leaving?" I asked.

"Because on the off chance I'm wrong about that, I don't want my client to be there."

I sighed. "You're a real piece of work, you know that, pal?"

"Love ya' too, Davi—" Yoel interrupted himself. “. . . Fuck.”

“What is it?” I said.

“Listen, the crew told me they’ll be there in about thirty minutes. Move your ass. Text me when you’ve left the house and I’ll let you know when they’ve left. If I remember your schedule correctly, tomorrow’s Saturday, right? You told me before that’s a workday for you—call it off, then. Meet me at my hotel tomorrow, I’ll send you the address. Chow.”

“You better be right about all this, man,” I said before hanging up the call.

There are still so many questions I have. At least most of them are answered. I went back, grabbed my wallet and keys then fled from the house again. It was at a pace that I hoped wasn’t alarming for my invisible little monster.

Currently, I’m at a Starbucks writing an unrevised version of these events before I send it to Yoel. If you’re viewing this on the 13th of January, assuming Yoel is able to revise & publish all in one day, then this is the day it’s being written. Either way, tomorrow it seems like we’re gonna confront this thing once and for all.

Whatever happens, happens. I guess.
