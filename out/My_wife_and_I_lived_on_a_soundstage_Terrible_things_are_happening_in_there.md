For a while, every day was the same.  


  
I'd wake up in the morning, kiss my wife, make a cup of coffee, throw on my uniform, and walk the beat. My beat. Where every day I'd say hello to the same townsfolk, pet the same dogs, and buy the same donut. Every. Single. Day.  


  
It was routine. It was predictable. It was perfectly normal. And I loved it.  


  
But then, one day... something changed.  


  
One day... someone had to go and get themselves killed.  


  
And the thing about murder in my town was... it had never happened before.  


  
Cause the truth is... my town... wasn't real.  


  
It was a fabrication. An illusion. An experiment. A "town" of actors, playing make believe on a literal soundstage built on an old airplane hangar out in the middle of nowhere. An "open world" within the confines of the hangar's walls, with no internet, or access to "the outside," as we called it. And everyone was in on it. Even me.  


  
The only catch was... nobody knew why the soundstage even existed in the first place.  


  
Some said it started out as a film shoot. Others said an immersive theater production. And some even said a roleplaying game. But I never saw any cameras, or curtains... or dice for that matter. For all intents and purposes, "the stage," as it had come to be known, was a living, breathing ecosystem, with its own currency, government, health insurance, education system, postal service, and of course... rules.  


  
Rules like leaving your cell phone at the gate on your way in. Signing a non-disclosure agreement on your way out. And never, ever breaking character, or questioning the soundstage, while you're inside it.  


  
Which is why, whenever my wife Laura and I did just that, we spoke in whispers.  


  
"Murdered?" Laura asked.  


  
"Murdered." I repeated.  


  
"But that's never happened before?"  


  
"I know. That's the thing."  


  
"Well what happens now?"  


  
"I mean if we were in the outside, the police - I mean, we, would investigate it."  


  
"Well why don't you?"  


  
"Honey, we're not equipped for that. None of us are actual cops. We're teachers, lawyers, janitors, and -"  


  
"Criminals?" She asked, pointing to me, with the same cheeky smile that she always did, whenever she reminded me of my sorted past.  


  
"And yes, criminals. Without any real authority, resources, or tools. I mean look at this, honey," I said, knocking on my gun, to a hollow sound. "How am I gonna catch a murderer with a wooden gun?"  


  
"So what happens to the body?"  


  
"They're burying it."  


  
"Here? On the stage? Without an investigation? How can they get away with that?"  


  
"Cause nobody in the outside knows about this place, Laura. And anyone who leaves here, is sworn to secrecy."  


  
—  


  
The next morning, the chief asked me to accompany him to the victim's private funeral, held at the stage's one and only church, and attended by only a select few privileged individuals.  


  
"We come here to celebrate the life of Oscar Morris. Not mourn it." Father Mullen, our resident priest, began. A priest we all knew well, and whose sermons, for many, were the cornerstone of our small but tight knit community.  


  
He then began to read from a passage that I read along with, in a book that I had picked up from the back of the pew.  


  
But as I continued to scan the page, something about its words seemed strange to me. Strange... and unfamiliar. Like the passage had been changed.  


  
But before I could dwell on the thought too long, Father Mullen finished reading. He then proceeded to share a couple fond memories of his few, but positive interactions with Oscar, before ending with a prayer, and sending us on our way.  


  
"Let us go in peace." The priest said, before gesturing for a few of us to help pick up the casket, and carry it out of the church, where it was to be taken away to be buried in some far off corner of the stage.  


  
Remembering Oscar to be a heavyset man, I leaned into my boots in such a way as to brace myself for the weight of the casket, but when I finally picked it up, I discovered that it was quite light.  


  
And as I helped the others carry the wooden box out of the church, my mind couldn't help but race.  


  
*Wait a minute. Oscar's body should feel heavier than this. Even with his weight distributed across four men, there's no way that the casket would feel this light. That must mean... that the body of Oscar Morris must not be in the casket. And begs the question... where is it then?*  


  
After placing the casket in the hearse, I pulled Father Mullen aside.  


  
"Father, I'm not quite sure how to tell you this...  but something's... not right about Oscar's casket." I whispered to the old man.  


  
"Whatever do you mean, my son?" He whispered back.  


  
"It felt... very light. And Oscar was a heavy man. We should check to make sure he's inside-"  


  
But the priest interrupted me.  


  
"May I have a word with you in the rectory?"  


  
—  


  
Father Mullen then led me back through the church, past the pulpit, and into his small office, shutting the door behind him.  


  
And after taking a seat on the other side of an oak desk, he gestured for me to sit down across from him.  


  
"You were saying?" The priest continued.  


  
"Father, I don't think that Oscar's body is in that casket."  


  
He paused for a minute, before smiling, and ironically, making a confession to me.  


  
"Well of course it's not."  


  
"Of course?"  


  
"It's a sacrifice."  


  
"A sacrifice? For what purpose would Oscar's death have been justified?"  


  
"No, no, my son. His body is literally being sacrificed."  


  
"That's a funny one, Father." I chuckled.  


  
But Father Mullen reassured me that he was serious. "I'm afraid it's not a joke. He's to be ritualistically sacrificed tonight, and all of the blood drained from his body."  


  
I stopped and took a moment to compose my thoughts.  


  
"You're... actually sacrificing Oscar? To what end? And why?"  


  
"Can I be frank with you for a minute?" The priest said, leaning forward on the desk, as he loosened his collar.  


  
"Sure."  


  
"Listen. This place... this... stage... is exactly that. A front. A facade. For what's really going on. And what is really going on... is best for you not to know. Let's just say, these people... these townsfolk that we let live here. Their stay here... doesn't come without a cost."  


  
"But-"  


  
"You're not really a cop, right? Just a regular guy, playing one?" The priest reasoned.  


  
"No, I'm not a real cop." I agreed.  


  
"Well, I'm not a real priest. Think of it that way."  


  
"I just don't understand."  


  
"Now, that leaves you with three options. One. You can either stop snooping around, go back to being a cop, and turn a blind eye to any murders or disappearances here on the stage. Two. You can leave the town today, return to the outside, and keep your mouth shut forever. Or three... You can die."  


  
He then leaned back in his seat, and gave me the opportunity to think it over. But I didn't quite know how to process what he'd revealed to me, let alone the options that he'd presented, or the threat, and said nothing.  


  
"Oh, and if you don't believe what we're capable of," Father Mullen continued, "You can ask your wife."  


  
—  


  
By the time I ran all the way back to my apartment, and burst through the door... it was too late.  


  
The priest's men had already broken in, tied up my wife, and left her sitting there, crying at the kitchen table, as she stared at the decapitated head of Oscar Morris, just lying there on a plate.   


  
Breaking Laura free of her bonds, I then led her into the other room, where I proceeded to tell her about my encounter with the priest... and his ominous implications about Oscar and the soundstage.  


  
So we did what any right minded individuals would do, packing our bags right then and there, walking over to the gate, signing two non-disclosure agreements, collecting our belongings and cell phones, leaving "the stage," and returning to "the outside."  


  
And in the ten years that have passed since we left, we've always honored the NDA and the priest's request to never, ever tell anyone else about the soundstage on the old airplane hangar out in the middle of nowhere, and what's really going on inside there...  


  
...Until now.
