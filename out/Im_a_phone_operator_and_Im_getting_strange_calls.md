This is my first time posting, I want to write this down because I want to prove to myself that I'm not going crazy, that what I've been experiencing these couple weeks isn't a cocktail of coincidences blended with sleep deprivation and down right losing my mind.

I have been working for the last 4 years as a shift phone operator for large scale hotel, because I don't want to outs the company I work for and risk my job I won't be telling you which hotel I work for nor where it is. Now my job is to pick up the phone whenever anyone either inside or out of the hotel calls, it can range from a guest  calling for more towels, report something broken in the room that needs fixing, to people outside the hotel calling in to get some info or book a reservation with us.

My department has it's own office space away from the other departments with a key reader door that only we operators have a key for, no one outside our department can get in, not even a manager. We are usually 4 to 6 agents on shift on any given day with about 2 or 3 for the night shift, but recently we lost 2 of our night agents, one who changed careers to be a supervisor for the front desk, and the other who got terminated for attacking a the other night agent.

It came as a shock, I've talked to the guy a few times and he always seemed nice and even supportive when I told him I hoped to one day grow into a supervisory role in the company, so that's why when I heard he started beating the other night agent to the point security had to pull him off, I just couldn't see the guy I knew in my head to be the same I'm hearing about.

After the incident we had to temporarily close the office at 12AM, you see our office is open 24/7, we always have someone in office, in case any of our guest wake up in the middle of the night to report issues or ask for a delivery, because of that we quickly had to re-open the office. Seeing a chance to get a salary boost I offered to switch to the night shift, I already knew the job, and the extra work the night team had just amounted to make some daily reports to send to the management.

So that's how I got switched over to work the night shift, starting at 10PM and finishing up at 7 in the morning.

The first night went well, when the last day agent clocked out at 12AM, I was by myself in the office, I brewed up a pot of coffee in our break room and watched my shows on max, in the office we have two simple rules, answer the phone within 3 rings and keep your phone on available whenever your at your desk. Follow them and you can keep yourself busy with whatever whenever there's downtime between calls. Didn't get any calls my first night and just did my daily report which took me a little over an hour to get done, the hardest part that night was just adjusting my internal clock to stay up that night.

The second night though, I think maybe that's when this started, it was 12:33AM and it was just me in the office, I just finished making a cup of coffee when my first call came in, usually any call from inhouse guest will show their names with their room number, that way when we answer the call we can greet the guest by their name, it's that little extra touch we give to form a connection with our guest, but this call didn't have a name with the room number.

Now it's not strange for an inhouse guest call to not show their name, it can takes a a while for a name to register to the room when they first check in, so when the call came in, it didn't click with me right away how strange this call was.

I answered the phone and gave a warm welcome to the guest, but got nothing, it was just silent, had to double check to make sure I still had the caller on the line, I gave another hello, just to see if I get an answer, I was ready to hang up when the caller spoke.

Hello.

It came out of nowhere and to the point, didn't sound like a hello to see if I was still there, wasn't even a greeting, just a hello, the caller then asked who I was, told him I was the phone operator and asked him how I could be of service to them, the caller didn't say anything back to me, before I could even ask if he was still there he immediately asked me for my name. Part of my job is that I have to give my name to any guest who calls in, so they can know who they are talking to and who to ask for if something goes wrong with their order if they liked my service, so I gave the caller my name, Jimmy J.

Went quiet again, the caller wasn't speaking, I couldn't hear anything in the background, couldn't even hear them breathing on the phone, just no sound, the caller then thanked me and hanged up.

I've been working as a phone operator for over 4 years and I have gotten a fair share of weird calls, kids playing on the phone, drunken guest, even had someone call in to ask if we found the bag of sex toys they forgot in the room. So it's not anything new for me to get a call like that, but still, that moment got stuck in my head and I couldn't stop thinking about it.

The rest of my night went by fast, maybe had a couple outside calls that night, nothing that stayed with me like that first one.

The following night at 12:33, I got another call, from the same room, and still no name to it, I hesitated at first but picked it up by the third ring, before I could get a word out the voice on the other end asked, is this Jimmy? I said it was, after a moment of silence the caller told me that he lost a watch, I asked him to describe the watch to me, it was a stainless steel watch, with a cracked lens, but when I asked him when he lost the watch, he went silent again for a full minute.

I called out to him, making sure the caller was still on the line, he then answered back, saying he found the watch, that it was on his desk, he then hung up and for the rest of the night I didn't hear back from that room.

That morning when the AM team started coming in I asked my friend I work with, if he's heard of anyone getting strange calls from that room, shook his head and said not that he is aware of, just getting the usual rounds of guest pissed off they didn't the exact view the wanted or that they reached their limit for towels.  
Shrugged my shoulders and went home to sleep.

Day 4 was different, the other night agent finally came back to work, I wanted to ask her what happened between her and the other guy, but I didn't think she wants to relive that moment again so soon. The rest of our night went okay, couple calls, people complaining about their neighbors making too much noise, one guy asking for some beers to be delivered, and some kid way past their bed time making crank calls. That night went by fast, and yet it didn't sit right with me, it was the first night since I started getting those strange calls where that room didn't call in.

The next night was no different, a whole shift came & went without hearing from that room, even asked my co-worker before we left that morning if she had any strange calls, but no, she only got outside calls trying to book a room. I felt a little relieved, thinking maybe they checked out or just didn't need anything. Managed to relax and decompress on my days off, played Overwatch 2 with my buddy, just wanted to ignore those calls, but, no matter how busy I kept myself, I just couldn't.

Went back to work, I was working alone again , the other agent was off that night, I was kind of nervous, wondering if that room would call in again, but I figured by now they had to have checked out, it's been a week since that first call, but the moment I thought that, 12:33 the phone rang, it was the same room number without a name.

I didn't want to pick it up, each ring was echoing in my head, I didn't want to hear what the caller had to say, I answered by the third ring, I didn't know what to expect, but the voice I heard did catch me off guard, it was a toddler on the other line, I felt relief hearing that voice, that moment I knew whoever I was speaking with before was gone.

The kid in that chipper way kids have when the just learned a new trick was giving me a hello, like they just learned the word, I gave the kid a happy hello back asking if their parents were there. For a moment it went silent again, no background sound, no breathing, not even the sound of anyone moving the phone around, I then heard the same toddler's voice again say hello.

He kept repeating hello, but each new hello the pitch was changing, getting deeper, until his last hello sounded exactly like that man from the first call, what he said next freaked me out so bad I hanged up, he said. Hello Jimmy. We're not suppose to hang up on a guest until we hear them say thank you, but that moment  it's the only thing I could think of doing.

I didn't know what to make of that, did that man have a voice changer on him, am I being pranked, I didn't know and didn't want to call that room, I opened our reservation records app and looked up the room, I needed to know who was in that room.

My blood went cold when I searched the room, no results, no reservation for that room. Who was calling me?

I didn't answer anymore calls that night, I put my phone on unavailable.

That next night I didn't want to come into work, I didn't want to get another call from that room, but I have to work, they depend on me. The moment the last PM agent left, I was alone again, I dreaded that call, 12:33 is when the phone comes in each time, so I decided to put the phone on unavailable and head into the break room and wait until it was past that hour, I probably waited a good 10 minutes before I walked back into to my desk.

My chest started to tighten, I could barely breath, and my legs couldn't hold me up anymore, I fell to the ground from what I saw, on my desk there was a stainless steel watch, the lens on top was cracked, and the hands stopped at 12:33.

That moment I didn't know if I should run out the room or call security, my head was racing a thousand miles a minute, I tried calming myself and try to rationalize it, the only thing that could make sense was someone is pranking me, had to be. I call up security, telling them I found a lost watch in the office, and asked if they could come pick it up, also told them I think someone sneaked in the office and is trying to mess with me.

Security came up, I opened the door for them, told the guy that last few days someone has been messing with me and that this time they came into the office to leave a watch on my desk. I pointed towards it, but the security just asked me, what watch? I turned around, and it was gone, I didn't touch it and I was in the main office the whole time, no one could have run in and taken it from me without getting caught.

I told the guy to check the key reader and see who was the last person to open that door, he did a quick scan, and the last person to open it, was me, when I clocked in to work.

  
That morning I could barely sleep, every time I felt like I was drifting away, I could hear the work phone ringing, I was thinking to myself how stupid this was, why is this happening to me. I wanted this to stop.

  
When I went in to work that night, I decided I was going to keep the phone on unavailable, I would be breaking our office rule but I didn't care, I just didn't want to hear that blasted ringing. I sat by the desk closest to the entrance door and kept my eyes fixated on the only door in and out the office.

Finally after a bit of waiting, the time was 12:33, my eyes fixed on the door and every office phone set to unavailable, tonight I wasn't going to hear that phone ring, then I heard it, the phone was ringing, while it's not impossible for a call to come in even when set to unavailable, the person dialing needed to have dialed that specific phone extension. That moment I decided to move away and go the next desk, but the moment I did that phone started ringing.

I kept moving away, sitting at every desk, but no matter which desk I went to those phones would start ringing that same room number, that room was following me, wherever I went that room knew where I was heading to, but then I saw something, I never paid attention to it,  because it's one of those details from the job you didn't really put too much focus on, but now, seeing the same number calling every phone, I saw it.

  
The room calling me, was room 1233, and what's worse, the hotel doesn't have a room 1233.

  
I froze, I couldn't believe it, how did I not catch this sooner, then at the moment I saw a tall silloute on the screen behind me, before I could even turn to face it, or even just run away, the whole room went black. The power went out, and the only light in the room was the blinking red lights on the phone, I let out the biggest bloodiest scream imagined, I screamed so hard my lungs were ready to explode, I thought, whatever forces are doing this, they finally came to take me, I knew this would be my last shift.

  
What happened after, I don't know if you would call it a miracle or just blind luck, I personally want to believe the former, the time was 12:34, and the power came back in the room, whatever figure was behind me was now gone and I couldn't have been more relieved. 

As soon as my shift ended I talked to my supervisor telling them I can't go back to the night shift, not alone at least, I didn't tell her what happened to me, because I know no one is going to believe my story. I submitted my application to return to my day shift, and called in sick until the change came in. 

  
Since going back to my day shift, I haven't gotten anymore calls from room 1233, even when the time reads 12:33PM, someone else in the office took over the night shift, and when they did I made a point of telling them to never answer any room calls that don't have a name on it. They shot me a strange look, as if I was some hobo giving advice on crypto, but that's okay, I know what I experienced and they will too when they are the are by themselves at night and that clock hits 12:33.
