My mother didn’t die of a heart attack.
That’s what the doctors said.
But Lola swore she saw something sitting on her chest.

Have you ever heard of Batibat?
Old folks say it kills you in your sleep. Not a dream. Not a heart failure. It sits on you—pressing, crushing—until you stop breathing.

I used to think it was just a bedtime story.
Until the night my mother died.

⸻

When we moved back to the Philippines, Lola warned us about the house.
“It feels heavy,” she said. “Like something’s waiting.”

The house was an old Spanish relic—brick on the first floor, bamboo and timber above, the kind with capiz shell windows and a giant wooden door you locked with a plank. My mom laughed at the old superstitions.
“Fairy tales,” she said. “The world’s modern now.”

The barrio was quiet, warm wind carrying the smell of mango trees. Neighbors brought fruit, rice cakes, and smiles. Hospitality, Lola called it.

Then one old woman pulled me aside.
“They cut a tree to build this house,” she whispered. “Something lived in that tree. It still does.”

I didn’t tell my mom. She wouldn’t have cared.

But when the sun went down, the air changed.
The house felt heavy. Breathing was harder. My head pounded like it was splitting open. My muscles ached as if the walls were pressing against me. I thought it was jet lag.

We went to bed early.
Mom gave Lola the bed and said she’d sleep on the floor until the hospital bed arrived. She laughed and told us to rest.
That was the last time I saw her alive.

⸻

I couldn’t sleep. Dogs barked like something prowled outside. Then the wind shifted. Warm air gone. A cold draft crawled in through the bamboo walls.

And then—silence.
No dogs.
No crickets.
Not even the wind.

Then Lola screamed.
A scream so sharp it split the night.
She was crying, howling my mother’s name.

I ran. The hallway stretched like it was growing longer with every step. I slammed into Mom’s door. It didn’t budge.
I kicked hard.
It cracked open an inch—then slammed shut again.
Something was holding it.

I pounded, screaming her name. Then I heard it.
A voice. Deep. Wet. Wrong.
Muttering words no one understood.
Then a laugh.
Not human. Not from this world.

Neighbors stormed in and rushed upstairs. When they heard the laugh, they froze.
So did I.
But I begged them.
Four men kicked that door until it burst open.

And there she was.
Mom.
Lifeless on the floor.

Lola was on the bed, sobbing into her hands.
And for a moment—just a flicker—I thought I saw something slither into the shadows. The floorboards glistened, like something oily had crawled away. And the smell—rotten fruit mixed with spoiled milk—stuck to my throat.

⸻

The doctor called it a heart attack.
Lola didn’t argue in the hospital. She waited until we were driving home.
“I saw it,” she whispered. Her voice cracked.
“It was sitting on her chest. Fat. Naked. Its skin dripping slime. Laughing while she gasped. Hair so oily it stuck to its face. And its smile—”

She stopped. Tears filled her eyes.

When we got home, I carried her to bed.
And as I walked past my mother’s room, I heard it.

That laugh.
Low.
Wet.
Coming from the dark.
And then—
the door to my room slowly started to close.
