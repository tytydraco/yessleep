I don't mean to sound ungrateful towards the Hunters for the seeds, because I truly am appreciative. When it comes to prosthetics from our world, they cost an arm and a leg (pun intended, die mad about it), especially for the options that are waterproof and capable of the complex motions I need for my job. 

That being said, it certainly is something to have a plant growing out of your arm. Or more accurately, *within* it. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

When the seeds first took root, I *felt* it. A slithering sensation beneath the still-healing skin, followed by the bright, blinding pain of them burrowing into my marrow. My arm had cramped up afterwards, my breath catching as fire flowed through my veins as my blood became theirs. Each beat of my heart fed them as they began their growth. In short, it wasn't entirely dissimilar to how it feels to be caught up in Briar's thorns. 

Now that I've felt both and have a basis of comparison, I have to wonder if they're related in some way. Or maybe it's like how hares and rabbits look similar, but are actually on completely different branches on the evolutionary tree. 

Before leaving the Houndmaster's home, the mechanic had given me some pointers  to reduce the possibility of rejection. The one that helped the most was that sunlight can help soothe the ‘growing pains,’ as he'd called them. Sure enough, the moment the afternoon rays touched my arm, the roots spreading through my vasculature like tentacles eased their travel somewhat. The anguish didn't go away completely, but it became much more manageable. 

However, there was one day during this hellish week where it downpoured for nearly the whole day. The seeds took it out on me, causing breath-taking cramps that I could feel radiating up to my elbow. Reyna ended up running out to find an indoor plant lamp because of how bad it got. It helps in a pinch, though natural sunlight seems to be more potent.   

As terrible as the pain was, it wasn't the most disconcerting part, in my personal opinion.

At around two in the morning, roughly three days after implantation, I was torn out of a dream about being back in high school by a maddening, burning itch, right at the tip of the stump. At first, I thought it was that damned phantom limb shit again, but it went deeper. Far more than the typical irritation that I was already getting too familiar with. 

Now that I was wide awake from nerves, I crept out of bed and ducked into the bathroom, not wanting to disturb Deirdre or Reyna. They’d done enough for me since I got hurt; the least I could do to repay them is let them have one night of uninterrupted sleep. Heart pounding, I took a seat on the side of the bathtub, bracing myself for the worst. As I unwound the dressing covering the end of my arm, my mind tortured me with unwanted images of skin blackened by gangrene despite knowing I'd followed my doctor's and Briar's instructions to a T. 

After taking numerous deep breaths in an effort to slow the pounding of my heart, I uncovered my arm. The start of a small, red stem was growing from my wrist. I had to look away. 

Leaving it uncovered made it hurt less. Helped with the itch, too. Don't get me wrong, I know this is a good thing; the seeds were working without complication. But I couldn't look at the plant arising from my body without feeling sick.  

There were concerned weed whacker noises outside the shut bathroom door, accompanied by some scuffling. In the brief time we've had our two new roomies, Fireball has demonstrated an uncanny ability to know when someone is in desperate need of cuddles. I let her in then reached down, letting her sniff my hand, then scratched her behind the ear when she headbutted me comfortingly. 

In the end, I loosely covered the stump and stem up with an oven mitt while Fireball acted as my little furry shadow, following me to and from the kitchen. Sleep wasn't happening for me that night, so I just laid in bed, staring at the ceiling as the little skunk snoozed, stretched out like an accordion between my legs. 

Most of my week has been spent watching impatiently as the stem got longer. Over time, it became an intricate network of spiderwebbing branches roughly the same size as what my natural hand had been. By that point, the phantom aches had become replaced with a harsh sting that had started out as tolerable, but gradually escalated. There were days when the pain made me immobile, even after covering them. It did help marginally, though even the light brushes of gauze were excruciating. The prescription-strength ibuprofen my doctor gave me didn't put a dent in it. 

Raw nerves. The branches were replicating nerves without having skin to cover them yet. It felt as if every molecule in the air was abrading the area with the intensity of sandpaper. I couldn't decide if the constant sensation of being flayed was better or worse than fluctuating between imaginary itches and nothing. 

Briar had stopped by between calls to check on my healing progress. At the time, Reyna and Deirdre were at work, and truthfully, I was bored out of my mind with nothing to do but check realty websites. For the most part, Fireball is great company, but she likes attention on her terms, and if she's not in the mood, she *will* let you know. 

The puffball was loafing about in the sun, pretending like I didn't exist, when I heard a knock. As I was getting up to check the peephole, like fucking clockwork, my neighbor's door flew open. *That's* an aspect of apartment life I won't mind leaving behind. While the walls are rather thin in these units, they aren't nearly as sound conductive as he seems to think that they are. 

Upon discussion with the person in the unit on the other side of him, the miserable old bastard is just as unpleasant to her and her two toddlers as he is to us. Then to top it off, I caught him staring at Deirdre's behind as she walked past the other day. Creep wasn't even subtle about treating her like she was a prize cutlet at the local butcher. 

Which brings us to when he got on Briar's bad side. 

I didn’t hear the first part of the crotchety bastard's gripe, just the last of his sentence: “-people coming and going at all hours of the day!”

Without any hesitation whatsoever, Briar coolly replied, “Like how I did in your daughter last year?”

*Oh, dear God.*

Before this dispute could descend even further into middle school territory, I loudly interjected, “Hi! Inside! *Now!*”

Leaving my neighbor red-faced and cursing at his back, the Hunter followed me inside. 

“Are you trying to get me evicted?!” I hissed, trying to keep my voice down. 

Briar apparently didn't share my desire for discretion, narrowing his eyes as he glanced around at the apartment judgmentally. “If that happened, you’d owe me a favor. I've seen cardboard boxes with more sturdy construction than this. The box would be more private, too. You know he presses a shot glass up to the wall to hear you better, right?”

That caught my attention. “He does *what now?*”

“You could always have some fun with it,” He suggested with a mischievous smile that I saw far too many times while he was implanting the seeds the previous week. “Make him regret listening in on you. Put on a little puppet show! Make him think that you're all in a murder cult together.”

*You mean the Wild Hunt?*

With no intention of following his terrible advice, I replied, “Can you please check my hand before you get me kicked out?”

Snickering, he nodded towards my left arm. “Alright, let's see what I'm working with.”

Unwrapping the gauze was a slow, excruciating process. It was hard not to wince at even the lightest of touches against the sensitive pseudo-tissue. Briar had to step in after a moment. Making me sit down as he delicately did the rest. It got to be too much once the branches were exposed to the elements once again. 

“It's looking good,” he remarked, then began fishing something out of his pocket. “I’m sure it doesn't *feel* good, but it's progressing exactly like how it's supposed to. No signs of infection or rejection, which is what we want.”

After producing an amber vial topped with a dropper, he went on to explain that the muscles had already started to form, as well as the other associated connective tissues. Afterwards, flesh would follow, then the screams of my nerves would subside. 

“In the meantime, this'll help with the discomfort,” Briar informed me as he offered me the vial. “No more than two drops each day. And it tastes horrible, so brace yourself. I recommend lime juice as a chaser. The acidity neutralizes the bitterness.”

Examining the bottle, I asked, “What is it?” 

“A painkiller from our world. Not eye of newt, if that's what you're afraid of. We also made sure to hold the snips, snails, and *puppy dog* tails.”

Shithead. 

Trying not to get snippy with him, I urged, “Please? I prefer to know what is going into my body before ingesting it.” 

He appeared to be fighting the impulse to roll his eyes, but elaborated. “It's sap from one of the captain's willows. Isn't learning fun?”

No. But I wasn't in a place to refuse, despite how disturbing the source of this tincture was. Two drops of it did what modern medicine couldn't, taking the scream in my new nerves down to a throbbing hum. For the first time since the stinging began, I could properly breathe.

Before he departed, I tried to ask about the spear Reyna had retrieved. As expected, he didn't have the authority to answer. My best guess at the time was that it was intended to be used against Gwythyr, in some regard. 

As far as the spear goes, its description matched that of a legendary weapon that I remembered from the old stories Grandma used to tell me. Such a weapon was said to be wielded by the god, Lugh, but upon doing some digging, a similar enchanted spear was said to have been used by one of Cú Chulainn's adversaries, Dubthach Doéltenga. However, one notable difference between the two is that the latter had to be bathed in blood in order to keep the spear from killing whoever wielded it, whereas the one Reyna took was found in water. And given the history lesson Iolo gave her about the tower, I'm thinking that this was Lugh's weapon. Though, it is worth mentioning that there are some sources that insist that they're the same weapon under different names. 

Forgive the infodump. I have literally nothing better to do until Reyna and Deirdre get off of work, so I'm making it everyone else's problem. 

Anyways, both spears – whether it's Gae Assail or Lúin of Celtchar – were said to be devastating in battle, capable of decimating enemies from afar with unbeatable precision. It was also said that the tips of both spears would burst into flames if a battle was nigh.

A battle such as Calan Mai. 

Was this Iolo's way of trying to end things between Gwyn and Gwythyr once and for all? Or was this for something else? 

A few days after skin started to grow on my hand, I finally had the energy to entertain the idea of having a long talk with the Hunters about how we were all going to move forward. By that point, the stinging had mostly subsided. It was still so horribly tender that exposing it to the open air hurt like a bitch, but it was a vast improvement over what I'd been experiencing prior. Even more significant was that I could actually move the branches.

It's hard to describe, but it still doesn't feel like *my* hand, or a hand at all, for that matter. I can maneuver it decently enough, but it's like I've got weights on the end of each finger. I've accepted that with my hand being gone and this being a new appendage entirely, this offputting sensation could be due to the fact that I have no muscle memory. Using it feels slow. Clumsy.  

It looks odd as well. The ‘flesh’ is a deep red when I'm properly hydrated and able to photosynthesize. It has a distinctly smooth, waxy texture that was reminiscent of sturdy leaves rather than skin. There are nail beds, but nothing resembling a fingernail to cover them. If you look closely, you can see what appears to be veins in the translucent pseudo-skin. In other words, it's obvious that it's a prosthetic, albeit one my ‘arms dealer’ wouldn't recognize. 

When Deirdre, Reyna and I went to check out a house for rent, the landlord kept looking at it when he thought I wasn't paying attention. Begrudgingly, I accepted that was something I most likely was going to have to get used to. I ended up putting it behind my back in an effort to keep it out of his sight, but the fucker still kept staring. 

Before I could tell him off, Deirdre did it for me, albeit far more gracefully than I would have. 

“Staring is rather impolite, don't you think?” she said with a disapproving frown. 

He flushed, instantly tearing his gaze away from my pocketed left hand. Without apology, he breezily kept crowing about the newly renovated living room, the granite counter tops, and *oh,* did you notice the crown molding that was original to the house? 

No. I didn't. Something else had caught my attention. While we were walking through, a window flew open seemingly on its own. 

“Oh! That happens sometimes!” He chirped as he rushed over to close it. “You know how old houses are.”

All three of us shared equal expressions of skepticism with one another. 

“Is there… *something* already living in this house?” Reyna asked carefully. 

*Or not living.*

“Oh, you mean like ghosts?” the landlord said with a chuckle that he'd probably meant to sound dismissive, but it was a bit too high in pitch to be convincing. “That’s just local talk!”

“And what, exactly, do the ‘locals' say?” I questioned, scanning the room to see if anything was amiss. 

The place looked spotless. Streaks were visible in the freshly vacuumed blue carpet. The wooden cabinets in the kitchen shone from a recent treatment. There wasn't even a hint of dust on the windowsill. Could be evidence of Housekeeper activity, or the landlord found a solid cleaning company to spiffy the place up before showing it off. All in all, unless he fessed up, we didn't have much to go off of. 

The landlord waved my inquiry off. “Oh, it's all superstitious nonsense. Nothing worth repeating.”

“Let us be the judge of that,” I retorted. “By law, you have to disclose any ongoing infestations to prospective renters. That includes the ones that seem unbelievable to most people.”

As he sucked air, Reyna chimed in, eyes still flitting around cautiously, “Has anyone died here?”

He shrugged again, then with a shake of his head, answered in a failed attempt at nonchalance. “Yes, there were some deaths that occurred, but that was *years* ago! Longer than any of you have been alive.”

Deirdre looked like she wanted to make a comment, but thought better of it. It probably was the wiser choice, but she did pass up a golden opportunity to mess with this slimeball. 

“What kind of deaths?” I pressed. “Murders? And what were the ages of the victims?”

He gave me a sour look. “Seems a bit morbid to ask questions like that, don't you think?”

Patiently, I replied, “Sir, we're pest control specialists. Whatever this is, we can deal with it. We just need to know what it is.”

“Deal with *what?*” He balked with a forced laugh. “There's *nothing* to deal-”

At precisely that moment, somewhere in the house, a baby began to cry. 

It wasn't the typical cry of a fussy infant at the grocery store. More distressed. Shrill. Reyna was shrinking into herself, her hand over her heart as the lights began to flicker in time with the infantile shrieks. Deirdre was still, eyes wide and locked onto the floor, her pretty red lips drawn together in a tight line. The blood had drained from the landlord's face. His hands were shaking. 

Not a Housekeeper after all. One of its cousins. 

These Neighbors tend to stay close to hearths and fireplaces, preferring the warmth of a fire over anything else. In homes that don't have such amenities, they often settle for furnaces or hang out by radiators, depending on the age of the house.  

As such, I asked the landlord, “Is there a fireplace?”

He blinked, then worked his mouth as if he’d been so spooked by the cries that he'd forgotten how to speak. “A what?”

At my question, the screams took on a much more grating tone, causing me to grimace. It didn't like the idea of me looking for it. 

For the most part, the treatment plans for Housekeepers and Redjackets are identical. As long as you leave them to their own devices and offer them some cream, they'll reward your kindness. Though, Redjackets are also known to enjoy slices of bread as well. One of the biggest differences between the two is that unlike Housekeepers, Redjackets don't transform when agitated like our favorite, self-appointed maids. That being said, they are still dangerous, especially when provoked. 

Two springs ago, a client didn’t like the advice we gave him and chose to take matters into his own hands. He located the Redjacket and tried to shoo it away by dumping a pot full of boiling water onto it. 

The next day, the client was found by his brother, chopped up and boiling on the stove in that same pot. 

“A fireplace,” I repeated patiently. “Or a hearth, of some sort. Somewhere warm.”

“Uh, yeah. In the basement.”

After telling him to stay where he was, I approached the only door we hadn't gone through yet. Deirdre opted to tag along while Reyna remained with him. 

The cries increased in volume as I passed through. And became much angrier. The screams grated like glass between metal gears. The light switch for the basement didn't work. Before I made my descent into darkness, Deirdre's hand appeared on my shoulder. A light, comforting weight. 

After steeling myself for the first atypical infestation I've contended with since my injury, I called down the stairs, “Can we talk? We don't mean you any harm.”

The cries morphed into words, the voice childish in pitch, but monstrous in tone, as if dark fingers were manipulating the vocal cords like a harp. “*This is **my** home!*”

If I'd known we were walking into a Redjacket's claimed dwelling, I would’ve brought an offering. But now that I knew that it was here, it was easy to see why this listing had been up for so long, and why rent was so cheap in relation to the nice neighborhood it was placed in. This Redjacket must've scared off other potential renters. 

I told the Redjacket, “We'll be back with a proper offering.”

It grumbled, but didn't protest. Its cries had stopped, for the time being. That was a good sign. That meant it was open to communicating, albeit begrudgingly. As long as we handled the infestation properly, we could be out of the apartment by the end of the month. 

Upon discussion with Deirdre and Reyna, the latter was understandably unnerved by the idea of living with a Redjacket. We made sure to have this talk outside where the house's atypical resident couldn’t eavesdrop and potentially take offense. Meanwhile, the landlord paced nervously nearby, eyes and nose red from rubbing at his face. 

We'd gotten him to agree to cut rent in half if we took the property, given that he'd initially failed to disclose the Redjacket in the basement. Some may wonder why we chose to rent a property managed by someone who'd potentially put us in danger with his secrecy. The short answer is desperation. Yinz already know the reasons why we're anxious to leave the apartment; the sooner we get out of Gwythyr's property, the better. And anyone who has looked at housing costs lately can tell you that a place to live with good space in a nice neighborhood has become an anomaly in recent years. 

Besides, I figure it would only be a matter of time before we were called out to deal with this infestation anyways. May as well mitigate it now before the landlord tries to mislead someone else. Someone that wouldn't know how to deal with it properly and would endanger themselves and anyone else living under their roof. 

“How do they compare to Housekeepers?” Reyna whispered, watching the house's front door as if expecting the Redjacket to burst through it at any moment. 

“Redjackets, generally, are more stable than Housekeepers,” I explained. “We wouldn't have to worry about it transforming. As long as we feed it in the same place every night and treat it with dignity, it'll be like having a fourth roommate that really likes to clean.”

Deirdre supplied, “They also bring good luck to a household. We certainly could use more of that. It's also got a nice yard, and it's close enough that I could walk to the office.”

Reyna nodded, but still looked rightfully concerned as she asked, “Are they pet friendly?” 

I hesitated. Ordinarily, Redjackets are good with common house pets such as dogs and cats, but one of the many chores that they're said to help out with is removing pests from homes. Depending on its opinion on skunks, it could see Fireball as an intruder. 

“That's a good question,” I replied. “We'll have to ask about that when we return.”

We made a quick run to get what we needed, then once the offering was acquired, we were back inside. Like previously, the Redjacket had begun to wail as I approached the basement door. I went first, leaving Deirdre and Reyna to wait at the top of the steps as I pressed on with a plastic bowl full of cream with a slice of Amish friendship bread floating in it. That may sound like an odd combination, but this is a delicacy to Redjackets. And nobody with any sense of taste can say ‘no’ to friendship bread. 

“We don't want to remove you from your home,” I assured it. “You were here before us and we intend to respect that.”

*CLANG!* I flinched as something pounded on the side of the furnace. There were footsteps on the wooden stairs as Deirdre raced down to check on me, but the Redjacket’s enraged shriek stopped her in her tracks.

“I'm alright!” I told her. “Just give us a minute.”

From the little bit of her that I could see, that appeared to be the last thing that she wanted to do, but she didn't descend the stairs further. 

There was a shadow in the corner. Roughly a foot tall in height. It was only marginally less dark than its surroundings. Humanoid in silhouette. 

When the Redjacket spoke, a slight German accent was noticeable now that it had stopped screaming. “If all three of you can look upon me without fainting, you will be fit to live under this roof.”

While nobody is certain how Housekeepers are made – assuming that they are made at all – the cause of a Redjacket's appearance is well-documented and tragic: if an unbaptized child has been murdered, there is the possibility that it may return as a guardian of its former home. Or as an avenger, if the murderer was somebody who lives under the same roof. My stomach dropped as my mind painted a macabre picture of what could've happened to the poor thing.

Nevertheless, I embraced the cold tendrils of dread as I told the Redjacket, “I accept.”

The shadows receded as the house's guardian crept forward, its small hands reaching up to adjust the crimson mantle that they're known for. Some have also been spotted wearing pointed caps, though this one didn't seem to be privy to such a fashion statement. Once it stepped into the spot of light provided from the open door upstairs, it revealed a face that was both young and old. The round, cherubic cheeks of a child were covered by neat white whiskers. 

Slowly, it removed its jacket, revealing a knife sticking out of its small chest. Deep gouges dented its torso as if whoever had done this had intended to puncture every organ in the Redjacket’s small body. Rather than being afraid, like I was expected to be, I teared up. Rather, I just felt sickened. Saddened. 

*Who could do this? Especially to a child?*

There was a gasp from behind me. It sounded like Reyna. 

Once it was satisfied that none of us were going to lose consciousness, the Redjacket put its mantle back over its thin shoulders, its small face grim. All of us had been shaken up in our own ways. Deirdre had needed to sit down on the stairs, her face buried in her hands as she sniffed.  Reyna kept her eyes low, wiping her own tears away, not wanting to look directly at the Redjacket. 

“I welcome you,” it said with a polite bow before retreating back into shadow. 

“Pardon me,” I interjected before it disappeared. “I just have a question.”

It paused, not turning back to face me. “What is it?”

“We have a skunk. She doesn't spray, but she can be a bit feisty. Is that alright with you?”

It repeated, “Skunk?”

“Yes.”

Another pause. Then, “Does the skunk bite or piss on the floor?”

“No.” Reyna answered for me this time. “She just has a slight attitude problem and stomps a lot.”

The Redjacket deliberated upon this, absentmindedly toying with something I couldn't see. 

Before it completed its disappearing act, it informed us, “The skunk is welcome as well.”

We move in once my lease is up at the end of April. 

I know how it probably looks to some of yinz: a self-inflicted horror story waiting to happen. However, unlike the worst of our clientele, the three of us can handle the apparently monumental responsibility of setting out nightly bread and cream to keep our house's guardian happy. And on a more compassionate note, I think it would be good for the Redjacket to have a caring household. Clearly, it hadn't been shown enough of that in its prematurely shortened life. 

With the housing situation figured out, that was one less thing to worry about. The next one on the list was the biggest: Gwythyr. Like I had alluded to four score and seven tangents ago, a discussion with the Wild Hunt needed to be had. 

Speaking of, when Reyna told me about her agreement with the banjo bastard, I'd been ready to cut him to ribbons, hand or no hand. However, once I'd stopped seeing red, I thought about it. *Really* thought about it. 

As much as I hate to say it, I know him. Far better than I ever wanted to. The fact that he's given her a decade is generous, and he does not afford generosity to many people. Something that she'd done had appealed to him; whether that was the way she handled getting the spear or how she volunteered to take on my debt, I'm not sure. Maybe all of the above. It's possible that this was an act of mercy on his part, but most likely, he wants to see if any of her impressive actions were a fluke or if they were truly representative of her character. 

In short, this decade is a test. One that I know Reyna will pass. 

Don't get me wrong, when she told me about all of this, I was still considering marching down to his shop to negotiate with him to try to take my debt back – at swordpoint, if I had to – but then Deirdre brought up a good point that stopped me in my tracks. 

“Part of what impressed the Huntsman was her bravery,” Deirdre said quickly, holding the top of my arm gently, but firmly. “Think of the implications. It wouldn't look good for her.”

I hadn't even considered that he could interpret an attempt at renegotiation as me bailing Reyna out. That would be enough for him to convince himself that her entire sacrifice was just ‘lipservice,’ as he put it. In that event, his disdain for her would be even worse than ever, and yinz have seen how he treats humans that he doesn't respect. She'd be *lucky* to be turned into a crow, at that point. 

“Please, let me do this,” Reyna pleaded quietly. “Like, I'm scared, but… I have time. You know?”

I'm scared for her, too. Believe me, I am. That being said, I have faith in her and I'll do what I can to help her every step of the way. 

After learning about the ten-year deal, it was hard for me to stomach the idea of seeing the mechanic again despite knowing that we needed him. It also didn’t help that our last conversation hadn’t exactly been pleasant, from what I remember while I was lying half-dead in the hospital. Likewise, I imagined that he most likely still harbored some ill-will towards me from my handling of the Wood Maiden situation, injury or not. 

Though, some of you have pointed out that I wasn’t in my right mind during that conversation, which yinz were right to. It’s possible that I may have misattributed his agitation as being against me. I don't know. I was there for the conversation, but not all there. Hell, I'd thought I dreamt that conversation between him and Reyna. 

It seemed that the Houndmaster’s home was becoming a primary meeting spot between our two organizations. What’s interesting is that she doesn’t seem to mind hosting. I daresay that she might even enjoy it. Prior to the meeting, she told us that tea was offered to everyone on the grounds that Orion supplied scones to go with it. 

When we arrived, we found that our hostess had set out pretty, antique teacups for everyone as well as a tiered tray for the aforementioned scones. The kitchen table had been shined up like a new penny. Deirdre, being the avid tea-drinker, had aided in selecting the ones she thought would best suit the occasion.   

She had also been the first to try the tea, taking a sip before anyone could protest. Nothing happened, just as she’d known it wouldn’t. A trade was a trade, after all.

“I already have two oversized juveniles to care for,” the Houndmaster said after surveying our reactions, earning side-eye from Iolo and a smirk from Deirdre as the Huntress poured herself some of the pink, floral-scented tea. “I have no desire to collect more.”     

“We’re the light of your life and you know it,” Briar quipped with a smile, his chin propped on his hand as he watched the stragglers (Victor and I) take our seats, paying special attention to the boss.

The Houndmaster exhaled heavily into her cup, muttering, “If you say so…”

Victor nodded at her with a look of long-suffering understanding as he took his place beside his thorn-wielding Not Boyfriend. The expression felt very targeted. Reyna and I exchanged a glance from where she sat across from me, staying close to Wes. 

To summarize, this afternoon tea was much more relaxed than the last time all of us met up together last fall for the cookie hag. Of course, that interaction had been so tense that we could pretty much only go up from there. Strange to think that was only a few months ago. It feels like centuries have passed since then. 

The mechanic was eyeing my left hand, though I couldn’t read his expression. Maybe this was a peculiar thought to have, but the last time we all had to work together, Iolo ended up losing a piece of himself. Now, I'm the one relying on parasitic seeds in order to function. 

Under his scrutiny, I flexed the branches uncomfortably, finding that even the sensation of something as mundane as wood was overwhelming to the senses. It was raining again. Even with the aid of the growth lamp, I've noticed that the new joints tend to ache when it's humid. 

The mechanic remarked, “You’ve been takin’ good care of it.” 

“Your advice helped,” I admitted, the closest I could get to thanking him without causing more trouble. 

Then with a slight smile, he informed me, “Rain fucks with mine, too.” 

He could tell? 

Victor ended up being the one to get everyone on track, simply having to raise his voice a hair more than usual to turn the attention of the room towards him, “To start this off, it may help if one of the Hunters could describe what we're in for when it comes to Calan Mai.”

Iolo's gaze slid over to examine him, his grin suddenly appearing bitter. “Same shit that’s been happenin’ since centuries ago: Son of Scorcher and the White Son of Mist cross swords, Hunters and Sentinels die, and it all means nothin’. Won't mean shit til’ the final days. It's all just one pointless fuckin’ formality to keep Ol’ Pendragon happy.”

Afterwards, the smile regained its familiar mischievous quality as he continued, leaning forward with renewed intensity. “But this year, we got somethin’ else in mind!”

Wes, who had been ordered to behave himself by the boss before we got there, appeared to be doing his best to refrain from diving across the table to wring Iolo's neck as he prodded, “And that is?”

Reyna tried to be subtle as she elbowed him in the ribs. She did not succeed. 

However, Iolo just chuckled. “Why, I'm *tickled* that you asked! We're gonna leave the fightin’ to the White Son of Mist and the others y'all got the pleasure of meetin’ on Halloween. Meanwhile, the three of us are gonna be hittin’ him where it *really* hurts. Know where that is, bloodsucker?”

“Nope,” Wes said apathetically, not appearing to be interested in playing this guessing game.

“All them human lawyers and chairmen we couldn't touch?” Iolo drummed on the table with his fingers for emphasis, still wearing a grin that came straight from Hell. “For one day, it's open season.” 

“What do you intend to do to them?” Deirdre inquired, brows drawn together in concern. 

The mechanic glanced at her as if he'd forgotten she was there and was unpleasantly surprised to find her in the same room as him. 

But his tone was cordial as he replied, “Ever since them blackpoll warblers were spotted, y'all may have noticed that construction has come to a grindin’ halt.  So that got me thinkin’ that maybe these esteemed assholes could help us replenish their populations *permanently.*  Along with a few other species that we just ain't seein’ enough of anymore.”

The Houndmaster agreed coldly. “Companies like theirs are the reason why those animals are disappearing to begin with. Only seems right that they should fix the problem they started.”

This may sound terrible, but I was past the point of caring what happened to the people working under Gwythyr. They didn't give a damn when people in town were vocal about not wanting them there. They also didn't give a rat’s ass when their expansions caused a food shortage in our county. As long as more zeroes got added to the ends of their paychecks, they didn't care what happened to any of us. 

And look at what happened to Reyna and me. I doubt we’re the only ones Gwythyr had lured into his home and introduced to his ‘Sentinels,’ as Iolo referred to them. We’re just the ones that got out.

On that note, I forgot to mention that Victor checked up on the Department of Wildlife a few days before this meeting. The officers that had played a role in the warbler case have been getting antagonized as well. They’ve reported being followed with one of their personnel actually having someone break into his house while his daughter was home alone. Luckily, she’d been able to hide in the attic before the intruder could locate her. When law enforcement investigated, they found that nothing was taken. This information was shared in our talks with the Wild Hunt. 

I’d known that things with this development company were going to get ugly. I just never anticipated that it would be like this.

“What do you need from us?” Victor asked.

The mechanic told him, “As of right now, nothin’. But on that day, you and your buddies at the Department of Wildlife are gonna wanna watch your backs. That’s what the spear’s for. We ain’t gonna be able to do much for ya, so y’all are just gonna have to survive the night on your own.”

He inclined his head at the spear, sitting with its tip submerged into a bucket of water. Had it always been there? Just chilling? Of course, you’d have to have a death wish in order to steal from a Hunter. 

Now that I’ve seen the fabled weapon myself, I have no idea how Reyna managed to carry that thing; it’s nearly twice her height and appeared to be made of sturdy, intricately carved wood. Whoever had crafted it had artfully adorned it with pointed leaves and Gaelic characters that Deirdre later explained were blessings intended to give the spear its power. 

It was a lovely weapon. One that would be fit for a god to wield. Provided, of course, that it didn’t burn said god that armed themselves with it alive. 

“Is that Gae Assail? Lugh’s spear?” I inquired.

Iolo looked impressed. “Someone’s been doin’ her homework!”

That was a ‘yes.’ And not a comforting one. “How are we going to keep that thing from burning one of us up if we try to use it?”

The mechanic’s grin wasn’t kind. “Just keep it covered in blood and it shouldn't be a problem!”

*Spoken like a true psychopath.*

Wes, to nobody’s surprise, volunteered. “Seems like fun.”

Iolo winked at him as he mockingly praised, “Knew I could count on you!”

“Aren’t they going to be anticipating this?” Wes pointed out, for once having the self-control to not take Iolo’s bait. “I doubt they’re going to leave all these key people unprotected.”

Briar gave the vampire a sneer. “You act like we aren’t experts at getting around things intended to keep us out. Or finding people that don’t want to be found. You had – what, three hagstones? – and we still got to you pretty easily.”

Before things could escalate, Victor curtly reprimanded the Hunter. “Be nice.” Then he glared at Wes. “You too.”

Wes raised his hand in a show of discombobulation. “Why am I getting yelled at?”

“You know why,” Victor snapped, then continued like an exhausted parent. “Now, we’re going to discuss this like adults and there will be *no* infighting. Understood?” 

The Houndmaster raised her teacup in silent acknowledgment. 

Meanwhile, Briar appeared to be biting back a smile as he rested an arm on the back of Victor’s chair, but didn’t say anything more. He merely stared down the vampire as if trying to pry open his skull with his mind. Wes, thankfully, didn’t feed into it.

However, Iolo shrugged one shoulder. “Really ain’t much more to discuss. Just don’t die. Y’all are annoyingly good at that.”

So that's our great plan: don't die. Excellent. We'll see how that goes for [us.](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/SO6b77lmMD)
