There’s a sound my hometown makes. 

You won’t hear it during the day. The background noise is too thick, I think: trucks downshifting, lawnmowers chewing up dead grass, the high-pitched screech of kids playing like they’re trying to drown themselves out. But if you wait long enough - if you sit still after midnight, with everything off, all the lights killed and the windows shut tight - you’ll hear it.

It doesn’t hit you all at once. It creeps in. At first, it sounds like nothing. Then it becomes a low hum. Then it starts to vibrate: deep, mechanical, slow. A kind of snarling. Like something enormous is breathing somewhere underground.

It gets louder the longer you listen.

When I was seventeen, I’d spend nights in my parents’ driveway with J. and G. We’d sit on the hood of J.’s car, chain-smoking and zoning out. Sometimes we talked. Mostly we didn’t. G. always pissed against the same pine tree, half-asleep on his feet. J. would say weird shit that should have been but didn’t feel like jokes. One night he muttered something about chess being a game about extermination, “either you kill or you wait to be killed”, and laughed with his teeth clutched tight.

We all heard the sound, I'm sure, but none of us acknowledged it. That was the unspoken rule I used to live by. Like saying it out loud would make it real or something like that. But it was there. Every night. Quiet at first, then louder, until it felt like the ground itself was humming. Not from below, but from the inside. Like the whole town was a shell and something was moving it from its guts outwards.

Then came the boar thing, and I actually started to feel like it was a proper haunting.

It was late, close to four. We were driving home from one of those afterparties that feel like a funeral clad in strobe lighting. G. was behind the wheel, eyes glazed. I was in the back seat. The thing came out of nowhere. Thudded under the bumper, rolled like wet luggage, and landed in the gravel ditch, twitching.

We got out. It was still alive.

Its ribs were sticking out of its side like broken scaffolding. One lung had collapsed. The sound it made wasn’t an animal sound. It was too rhythmic. Too deep. It wheezed, but it wasn’t breathing. It was imitating something. To my ears, it was mimicking the hum. I did not say it to J. and G. but I want to believe that they felt it too. That thick, metallic grinding, steady as a heartbeat.

We didn’t talk. J. threw up in the ditch. G. just stared like he was waiting for something to happen. We left the boar there and drove home in silence. The sound didn’t stop.

It never does.

I left that town when I was nineteen. Bounced around: shared apartments, sleeping bags, trains. Eventually, I ended up in Bruxelles. Third floor. Yellow walls. Too much light. The parquet always looks wet no matter how clean it is. The bulbs flicker like they’re whispering. The radiators tick in code. I can’t sleep anymore. Not real sleep. Just benzo-blackouts broken by gulps of cold air and the taste of metal behind my teeth.

The sound stalks me.

It’s changed. It used to be distant: just below the horizon, buried in dirt. Now it’s in the wiring. It hums through the pipes. It breathes through the vents. It waits behind the mirror like it’s trying to push through once and for all.

Sometimes it morphs into a thing in my shallow dreams.

Not clearly. Just the shape. Huge. Made of teeth and steam and something like bone, but stretched and boiled into chrome. Its face flickers like headlights in the fog. It doesn’t move, but it doesn’t need to. It knows I’m here. It’s watching me the way the head of a factory watches its assembly line. Not curious. Just there to make sure all the limbs go through the motion.

I read once about a medieval torment used on people accused of witchcraft. They’d hang them from trees in sacks, suspended just low enough to swing. Villagers would beat the bags to keep them awake. Days. Weeks. Locked outside the realm of sleep. Just to see what would happen when the mind broke in silence. Just to force them to spill their guts and do as they were supposed to.

That’s what this sound is. A kind of torment. Not an attack. A presence to make me behave the way this wretched cosmos wants me to.

A way to make me go through the motions. Even if I don't want to, especially if I don't want to.

I lie awake as I'm writing this, listening. It no longer waits for silence. It doesn’t creep anymore. It rumbles. I hear it through the bedframe. I feel it in the floorboards. It's no longer confined to my hometown's dirt. It grew out of it like I did. It’s learning how to speak: how to use the spaces between walls like lungs. When I walk from room to room, it follows. As I step outside, it is there as well. When I stare into the drain, I hear it inhale and breathe out.

I think it’s almost finished building whatever it’s been building for me. That project I had to carry out is almost done.

And I think it wants me to see it when it steps out of the dark. Take it all in.

Maybe no one else ever heard it, but me. Maybe it chose all of us - me, J., G. - back when we stood in that driveway trying to outsmoke the sunrise. Maybe we were the first cattle to sense the slaughter. Or maybe the only ones dumb enough to listen. Maybe they are living their lives somewhere far from me, going to the motion too. Maybe I'm not alone.

But one thing is sure: it’s here again. Louder. Close. Not humming anymore. Not pretending to camouflage.

It’s breathing.
And it wants me to listen.
