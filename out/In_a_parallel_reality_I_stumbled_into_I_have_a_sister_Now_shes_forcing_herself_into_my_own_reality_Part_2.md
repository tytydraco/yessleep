**Part 2**

September 15, 20xx

When there is fire, people tend to watch the flames or the burning objects. But with me, my eyes tend to be more attracted to the smoke — how they twirled and bounced in the air with the wind. If I were to explain it, I probably found it fascinating how even when the fire is gone, smoke still comes out of the ashes. Smoke signals a warning of a reignition. Smoke means something is waiting underneath the destruction. If given the chance. 

That was what I felt when I watched the stool burn away in my friend’s fireplace. I felt that even with the stool totally burnt, it wasn’t enough. There was this gnawing fear that there was more I needed to do. 

 My entire morning was a blur. When I touched the stool and it was warm, I remember holding my head in my hands and repeatedly screaming, “No!”. After a few moments of panicking, I called up one of my college friends and asked her if I could torch something at their family house’s fireplace. Immediately, without changing out of my pajamas or even drinking water, I went to their place and threw the stool into the fire. 

Seeing me in that state must’ve been like seeing a deranged person running away from the mental hospital. My friend worriedly asked me what was wrong when she saw me scrambling to push the stool’s legs deeper into the fire. 

I sniffled, watching the smoke, “Sorry Hannah, it’s been a rough week for me. Someone’s… been stalking me lately and sending me things.”

I lied so naturally, a habit I didn’t know how I developed from childhood. “This is the latest one and I think I just finally cracked from the fear.”

”Oh my God,” Hannah gasped, joining me on the floor. “That must’ve been so scary. When did this start? Did you go to the police? Why didn’t you tell me?”

Hearing her questions somehow made my head hurt. The ringing in my ears is rising in volume. And if last time was any indication, the nightmare was about to pull me back in. Any anxiety I had instantly doubled and washed over me. I shivered, even though I was close to the fire. 

“I’m sorry Hannah for freaking you out too,” I moaned. “But I don’t want to talk about it now. Please?”

I could feel her stare bore into me for a few seconds until she sighed in resignation. “Okay, I understand. I made some eggs and toast, join me in the kitchen if you want some.”

I finally turned towards her, gratitude in my tone. “Thank you so much. I’ll definitely explain everything to you soon.”

Hannah smiled warily but her expression hardened. “Sure, Seli. Just update me occasionally. If you don’t, I’m going to assume something’s happened and I’ll storm your apartment with the police. You got that?”

I laughed, “Alright.”

Hannah stood up and walked towards their huge dining area. As if to lighten the mood, she started enlightening me about gossip from her work and some drama about her boyfriend’s friends' girlfriends. She didn’t seem to mind me staying silent. Just like when we were in college.

Gazing back into the fading smoke, I gulped and started doing some breathing exercises. I kept it up until I could no longer hear the wood crackling or feel the warmth on my face or hear Hannah groan about someone named Amy. And when there was nothing left but the ashes, I prayed that nothing else would bother me. And in my friend’s house, I thought my prayer would be answered. 

And later, I would know that there was no answer.

After breakfast, I realized I did not have my diary with me. I usually had it with me wherever I went. Without it, I felt incomplete. And now, with what’s going on, I felt unsafe too. In my fear, I left the things that could potentially keep me grounded and sane. 

Hannah, somewhat as a joke, suggested I write in a Google Docs or maybe even post onto a private Instagram or other social media. Something that I could access anywhere and anytime. But I reminded her that not only did I not have an active social media account, I did not have my phone with me. And Google or other sites required 2-step verification with a second device or your phone number if I attempted to log into them. And as I stayed there whining, she handed me her old laptop and told me to go on Reddit and make an anonymous post. 

She even reasoned, “Who knows, maybe someone is going through the same thing you’re going through and will help you out. Or at least, Reddit’s a valid place to complain about it.”

I took a few seconds to think about it. She was kinda right - I don’t have my diary *or* my phone and all I needed was to vent in my writings. And, really, the medium didn’t matter. If I didn’t stick to my Mom’s tradition, I would've already started an online diary somewhere on the internet. 

Thanking Hannah, I started typing on the dining table while she did the dishes. Knowing I wasn’t alone, even just for a little while, lessened the tension in my body. That was good. It made me write clearly and precisely all my thoughts down.

At some point, Hannah mused, “You really love journaling, huh.”

“Uh-huh,” I grunted, eyes on the screen.

“When we were in college you’d always immediately pull out your journal at the end of the last class. You would zone out while you were writing. And sometimes you were so in the zone, you didn’t notice us taking pictures with you.”

My typing paused and I looked at her dumbfounded , “Wait seriously? Why am I finding this out *now*? I must’ve looked weird!”

She laughed, “No, you looked endearing! Everyone said so! But *you* should also know we have an album of just you just writing in your journal.”

That made me think. “Do I really concentrate that much when I write?”

Hannah nodded, “Mm-mmh. It’s like you didn’t think of doing anything else until you finished writing. We get it, though. You told us it was like a ritual you had with your mom.”

“Huh.” 

I heard the clinking of dishes stop and Hannah wiping her hands. With a lull in the conversation and my focus gone, I tried to recall why I was so gungho about writing during college. I wasn’t that serious when I was a kid. Then again, I was *still* a kid. Maybe it was a trauma response to my mom’s death? Maybe. 

Hannah, having prepared tea and coffee, sat across from me. “It’s actually impressive you’ve kept it up all this time. It’s like keeping a part of your mom with you. I like it. And it’s also a good habit to have.”

“Thanks,” I softly said. 

“How did you maintain it all this time anyway? Surely, you must've been bored doing it, especially when you were in high school.”

That question triggered a memory within me. It just popped in my mind, like an elusive deep-sea fish breaking the surface of the water. 

“I guess I had a pretty strong motivation to do so.”

”Oh? What would that be?”

“My mom’s Christian, so she had me baptized as a baby, right? But I never really went to church cause my mom wouldn’t bring me there, on account of her working even on weekends. So I… developed a habit of praying to just about anyone.”

Hannah made a confused face. “Wait, how?”

”Okay. For example, on Christmas, I wouldn’t write a letter to Santa or even Jesus. I would just write, ‘To whoever’s listening…’”

Laughter erupted in the room. I couldn’t blame Hannah for trying to hide her giggling. I ended up laughing with her because of how ridiculous my story was. 

“So when you were a kid, you were, like, praying to the wind?”

”I know it sounds random and out of nowhere but it’s true,” I explained in fits of laughter. “Everytime I wanted something I would look outside the window and just go, ‘Please, please, please’.”

”How did your mom react?” Hannah asked, shaking her head. 

I took a breath as I calmed down. “I think she heard me wishing on the stars and to imaginary fairies constantly that she thought it would make sense to just make me write them down on something. Mom probably didn’t want me to start doing the ‘praying’ that I was doing at school.”

Hannah sipped at her tea as she thought out loud. “Oh, I get it. When you were a kid, you wrote down your wishes in your diary. And since you don’t really lose your desires as you grow up, the habit just formed.”

“Yes,” I affirmed her conclusion. “However, when you grow up, your wishes just get fewer and fewer and you become more grounded to reality. At least, that’s what happened to me. So over time, my habit evolved into simply recording my daily life.” 

In my mind, it made sense. I was a kid full of prayers that I scattered to the winds, hoping it would reach anyone — be it a god, an angel, or even a devil. But when my mom died, those prayers died with her. The diaries turned into a way to keep a memory of her alive, so it just contained frustrations and “what-ifs” about my life.

Now that I’m thinking about it and writing stuff here, I feel like I haven’t been writing optimistic things lately. My wishes have dried up and my life has remained the same monotonous grey.

Hannah couldn’t keep me as a guest even for a night. Apparently, she had plans to have dinner with her boyfriend tonight. And having no plans on being a third wheel, I bid her goodbye. But not before promising her I would call at the first sign of distress. 

My hands were shaking when I opened the door to my home. Stepping in, I saw that my apartment remained the way it was when I left it this morning. But instead of relaxing, I got even more nervous. That meant whatever change was about to happen needed me to witness it. 

Worse, the ringing in my ear came back. My anxiety was slowly worming its way to anger. It was ridiculous to feel unsafe in my own house. But I couldn’t deny that I was also scared. 

*Crap, I should just go to a hotel tonight.* 

Steeling myself, I strode towards the bedroom to pack some things. I quickly found my phone still connected to the charger. My gun, work clothes, and other necessities were dumped into a backpack. Finally, I retrieved my diary from where I hid it. Without looking, I threw it in, zipped up the bag, and looked for my shoes.

I didn’t bother changing out of my pajamas. No shower, either. Without context, I looked like an overgrown kid running away from home, with a backpack and keys in hand. 

Driving away in my car, I allowed myself to relax and listen to music. I drove quietly with only pop tunes and the GPS filling in the silence. Soon, the mechanical voice alerted me that I was near my destination. And as I attempted to make a turn, a bike suddenly came into my view.

I cursed out and stepped on the brakes. The sudden stop lurched me forward along with my bag. I heard it topple over and some of my things spilling out. In my rush, I might have failed to zip it up properly. 

Making sure no one was injured, I chided the cyclist loudly before calming down. Then I remembered my bag. But I couldn’t exactly try to retrieve my things now, so I just made a mental reminder for myself to secure them better next time. I reached over to right the position of my bag at least but then something caught my eye.

It was my diary. The small, leather-bound one I bought earlier this year. But one thing was off, something I didn’t see when I was hastily shoving things in my bag. The color was different.

My diary had turned pink. Magenta-like, bright pink. Like my first diary.

Before I could think of anything else, a piercing honk blared as a truck was barreling towards my car. The sounds of a crash reverberated in my ears along with a high-pitched ringing.

Needless to say, I woke up to the other world. At first I wasn’t sure since I woke up in a hospital ward and everything looked “normal”. But I noticed I didn’t have injuries or bruises that might connect to a car crash. Also, my bag with my belongings were nowhere to be found and the nurses looked at me weird when I asked for them. And then my suspicions were confirmed when Casey walked in. 

She merely shook her head at my glare before walking up to my bed and explained what happened. She said she witnessed me faint and fall to the floor, hitting my head. And unable to wake me up, she brought me to the hospital. It had been 4 days since. And it seemed like “our” father wasn’t able to visit. 

It must’ve been when I blacked out and returned to the real world. Then when the crash happened, I was inexplicably pulled back here. Yep, I was right. *This* is a nightmare. 

I pressed my palms to my eyes. *What was the trigger for the switch? I know the sign of it happening: the intense ringing in my ears. But what caused it?* 

*What brought me here? And why did items that belong here appear in the real world?*

I sighed and closed my eyes. There was no point thinking about it, there was too much to process at the moment. And perhaps if I sleep now, I’ll wake up to the real world tomorrow. But just as I was about to get comfortable, Casey piped up. 

“Since you woke up and doctors found nothing wrong with you, they’ve allowed you to be discharged tomorrow,” she happily exclaimed. “And once you’re stable enough, I’ll contact your therapist to assign more sessions for you.”

I made no response and my eyes remained closed. Whatever’s going on isn’t real anyways, and she hasn’t made a move to threaten my safety. In regards to my sanity, on the other hand, is another question. But as long as I keep a safe mental distance from her and everyone in this world, I can most likely return home. I know it. 

The voice in my head said so.

September 18, 20xx

Getting home was a breeze but settling in in the odd apartment that I, according to Casey, shared with her was anything else but. Like I said before, there were random things here and there that were the farthest things from what I would’ve bought. It took some time, but I managed to control my reactions whenever I saw something new. 

I tried to relax with a cup of coffee in front of the TV even though Casey hovered over me. She didn’t hide that she was wary of how I’d act. And considering I pointed a gun at her the last time I saw her, I could not blame her.

Eventually, I gave up and went to my room to do something else. Then it dawned on me to check my diary. *Has it actually turned pink?*

The answer was no. Pulling it out of the plushie, it was still black, as it always has been. *But then what made it turn pink? Or did I just hallucinate it happening?*

*What was real? What was fake?*

Staring at it won’t answer my questions, so I settled myself onto a chair in my room, ready to write a new entry. However, before I could do that, I had to read my past entries. I half-expected the change, but seeing it with my own eyes was nothing short of horrific. 

It was my penmanship and my writing style. I could even identify the different types of pen I used. But the entries were nothing from what I remembered. Just skimming through it, I mentioned Casey a handful of times. The word “roommate” even appeared in some of the pages.

I felt a headache coming in. Then the unmistakable feeling of familiarity for the entries in the diary washed over me. Suddenly, the words I didn’t remember writing felt natural. With my gaze finally fixed on a blank page, a memory of me going to the park with Casey started playing in my mind. 

I was lying down on the grass and Casey came over to scold me for not laying out the blanket. I laughed and helped her unpack food and drinks from a big canvas bag. I remember reading a book and drinking hot chocolate from a thermos I prepared. And my sister was beside me, typing on her laptop, probably working on her newest book. 

*What was the title again? She told me me it was a children’s book this time cause her publisher—*

The “memory” stopped there. The pain woke me up, my hands shaking from the slap I gave myself. 

“What just happened?” I murmured. “I don’t— I never…”

Then the ringing came. It was painful but right now, it was giving me a chance to escape this nightmare. I knew. It was the warning that I was going to go back to the real world. The pain upped a level and I was ready to scream, but I held it in. Waiting for salvation, I closed my eyes and held my breath. 

But it stopped and I felt a hand on my shoulder. And between my rapid and shallow breathing, I swore I heard someone click their tongue. 

I lifted my eyes to Casey. Her smile was like what a mother would give to her child to comfort them. But to me, it was laced with something more sinister, something otherworldly.

September 19, 20xx

Casey didn’t say or do anything out of the ordinary when she found me acting weird yesterday. She chalked it up to an “episode” when I asked during dinner. Then she gave a curt smile and stayed quiet for the rest of the night. This morning too, she acted normal and saw me off as I went to work. 

At work, meanwhile, nothing changed. No new boss or strange coworkers I didn’t recognize. Left with a piece of the real world, I worked without thought. I wasn’t given a chance to think about my situation anyway, because I was bombarded with reports and emails. Well, owing to the fact that I was unconscious for days at the hospital, there were things that certainly needed to be completed right away. 

I ended up staying late, of course. And as I stepped out of the office at 8 PM, it occurred to me that I hadn’t mesaged Casey about coming home late. But I caught myself reaching for my phone to call her. *Wait, why should I call her as if she’s actually real?*

I made an agreement to myself to play along to this reality. That didn’t mean I should let myself get carried away. And besides, even if I did have a sister, I’m already an adult. I’m fine. 

Driving home amidst traffic was the same degree of frustration. If the parallel world was going to change something, it should’ve eased traffic for everyone. While waiting for the nth red light to turn green, I reminisced about the time Casey slept during traffic and woke up thinking we made it home, only to see we never moved from the same spot. I chuckled to myself. 

*Wait, what?*

Honking from the cars behind me distracted me from my thoughts. Driving off and getting home, I eventually forgot what got me so confused. 

Casey was typing on her laptop in the living room when I walked into the apartment. She might’ve been too busy because she only greeted me back with a grunt and a wave. She was so in tune in writing that she didn’t notice me watching her. 

Somehow, it felt more natural for her to be here. The incongruity I felt was gone and replaced with a sort of harmony. Casey, my sister, felt more familiar than the thought of me being alone in this apartment. 

Then I started thinking about the supposed mental illness Casey said I had. False memories replacing real ones due to trauma. *Could she be telling the truth?* 

As I sat on the bed, I glanced at my socks. Socks our father gifted me when he visited us a year ago. Then I caught a glimpse of one of the pictures decorating my walls. There was a picture of me and Casey…with Mom. 

*Wait—*

”Your 11th birthday,” Casey said with a smile, standing by the door. “Too bad I wasn’t actually there. But when I found the photo in Mom’s room, I just couldn’t help myself making a version where I was there… with you.”

As she approached me, I looked closely at the framed photo. It looked like she was actually there. 

“You must be pretty good at photoshop,” I concluded. 

She giggled, “I wish. My friend did the editing. He used one of my own birthday photos taken during the same year you had this party.”

Never taking my eyes off the photo, nostalgia and longing filled me. “Looking at it, it makes me miss Mom even more now.”

I could feel Casey alternating her attention from me to the photo. Then, as if a light bulb lit up above her head, she nudged me. 

“What do you say we go home?” She suggested. 

“What? Why now?” I countered. “I can’t just go home when I suddenly miss Mom. Besides, I have work and so do you.”

”No, think about it,” Casey said, beaming. “When was the last time we visited Mom? Don’t you think it’s about time to check up on her?”

I was thinking of rejecting the idea when she continued. 

“I need material for my children’s book anyway. It would be nice to get fresh concepts for a story when we’re out of the city. Also, it would be *extra* nice for you to use your *extra* PTO, that you didn’t use when I invited you to come with me to Hawaii.”

I cringed at that reminder. I remembered promising Casey that I would vacation with her to Hawaii, but work overwhelmed my schedule that I ended up cancelling. After that, Casey would not fail to bring it up everytime I mildly upset her. 

With a deep breath, I returned her cheeky grin and nodded. “Okay, fine.”

She held my hands tightly as she jumped up and down. “Yes! I’m going to pack my things and you should too!”

She practicallly skipped out of my room and went out to look for our suitcases from one of the closets near the entrance. 

Feeling her enthusiasm, I went to one of my bedside tables to look for my phone charger. It died during traffic and I needed to let Dad know of our plans cause Casey usually forgets to update him. 

Suspecting that the charger may have been left unplugged this morning, I knelt down and started to pat my hand around for it behind the table. But I felt something else. A gun.

*Weird. I knew I had my gun under the bed. Did I change where I hid it somehow? But when?* I inspected it in my hands, turning it around to maybe gauge whether this was Casey’s. 

Then in a violent rush to my head, a ringing drilled into my ears, along with it was a desperate voice. 

*Stay away from her. Stay away from her. Stay away from her—*
