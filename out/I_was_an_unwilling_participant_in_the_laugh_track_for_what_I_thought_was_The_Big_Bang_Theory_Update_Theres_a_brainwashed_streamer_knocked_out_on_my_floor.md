There’s a peeker in the vent.

I have learned there are specific-colored rooms inside the Darkroom facility.

The Red Room is where Brightwood’s residents are brutally molded and contorted into killers, turning living, thinking, and breathing human beings into shells of themselves, mindless caricatures for an invisible audience with eagle eyes on their every move. This is where Darkroom’s [best and brightest](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14xywcb/i_was_an_unwilling_participant_in_the_laugh_track/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2) are created, the faces you see on the front page showcasing their most popular streamers. 

The Yellow Room is where I narrowly escaped—a torture chamber built for the sole purpose of creating a never-ending laugh track out of the mangled corpses of its victims, where they continue to laugh, long after death, long after decomposition, when their skin has melted and crumbled from withered bones. 

The Purple Room is where I am yet to visit.

It takes care of glitches and mistakes inside twisted minds, ensuring Brightwood residents are not thinking for themselves or have become victims to the very implant sandwiched at the back of their mouths. 

The Purple Room exists for those who were specifically made for Brightwood. Darkroom OG’s, they call them. These guys weren’t naïve idiots like me who quite literally walked into my own almost-murder. They were stitched and shaped from birth. I haven’t been in this place long or known about these people for barely a few days—but from what I have gathered from certain people, the one room neither of them can bear, even carved into masochistic monsters who revel in their own unraveling. The Blue Room is the unspoken demon that haunts their shattered minds, the center and catalyst of their undoing. 

I don’t know what goes on in there, and I don’t want to know. Though I have a feeling I will soon know. This place broadcasts the OG’s and their loss of humanity like daytime television. The White room is here. Where  I will lose myself. It is a waiting room made of what used to be pristine white marble, stained, and splattered revealing shades of intense red. I think I am still in shock so I am not fully registering where I am, and my fate as of now. 

I can see where blood has been scrubbed from the expanse of white. 

I can see where people, now Brightwood residents, have smashed their skulls into the floor and walls to try and stall, to try and save their minds. Built into white marble are four television screens on each wall. I have no doubt they are going to fully take me away and officially make me a Brightwood resident. 

It’s only a matter of time before I fall into the red—like I should have days ago, a prisoner of the laughing track room screeching out hysterical laughter which writhed inside me and became a part of me. I thought laughing myself to death and becoming a never-ending host for a human laugh track would be a horrific fate, but I was wrong. Being here where they were, the OG’s of Brightwood, the heart of a fictional town, is worse. I wonder if they have been in this exact position. Elle. Kaz. Annalise. There are no chairs, so I am sitting cross-legged on freezing cold flooring. 

Did they scream for their minds, or were they so broken, so shattered upon repair that they laughed?

Oh, I know they laughed. 

This room is tiny and claustrophobic. It was built with the intent to shatter minds and souls even before the red drowns, filling you up. There is no door. Well, there is. But I can’t see it. The door is built into the walls, perfectly sandwiched between the white. I can see bloody handprints on the walls where others have tried to feel their way to the crack of the door, but I am not stupid. I know a door does not exist; only the hope of one does. 

And once the reality hits me that there is no door, no exit, no way out, I will fall apart like every other who has been inside this waiting room and forced to live out every second and minute like it was their last. The television screens flicker like a tease as if knowing when to catch my attention, drawing my gaze to blaring white.  Four walls. I keep looking at them, and every few seconds I glimpse a brand-new blood stain. Some of them are large, taking up whole tiles, while others are a little harder to see. But if I am really looking for them, I see them as engrained scarlet pooling in the gaps in crevices. The ceiling is the same. I wonder if heads have exploded in here, which is why the tiles above me are stained vivid smears of cardinal. I know you expect me to ask for help, but I am way past that.

This place is not on a map. 

I don’t know how I got here, and all I know is the inside. I have a phone, but the battery is slowly dying. I keep looking up at the screens looming over me. I’m not sure why his torture, both as a child and an adult will be my unraveling. They preview it like I am in a fucking movie theatre, his face writhing in agony, his squirming body wiggling in restraints. I lost hope of escaping this world several hours ago when my own crumbled around me, and I realised my mistake of helping a seventeen-year-old boy belonging to an organisation that is not just national. 

It is global. 

Darkroom does not exist on one server, it thrives on multiple. And when one goes down, another hundred pop up somewhere else. It is an unbeatable and hopeless hell, and empathy was my downfall. I should have left him. I should have left him inside the car wreck and let these bastards take him back. Because of him, I am here. Because of him, I bear the exact same marking on my arm which makes me a product. The ink is still wet, and I’ve tried to scrub at it, but it’s a permanent stain on my skin, officially making me theirs.

Property of Darkroom.

Kaz Issacs is the face of Darkroom, alongside Elle. So I can understand why this place is covered in posters and merchandise with their faces. But what I can’t understand is why Darkroom is using a brainwashed and tortured teenager to take my mind.  Was Kaz Issacs’s transformation into a psychotic killer so popular that they now use it to turn others? 

Because what says losing all hope and faith, than watching a kid shatter over and over and over again, a puppet of both Darkroom and its deprived viewers who want to watch him on repeat. His face joins Elle’s on the preview screens flickering around me, their vacant grins boring into me. I can’t help but wonder if I am going to end up there. If I am going to become a member of Brightwood, an overexaggerated version of myself, and I won’t even realise it because my mind will be shredded apart. He told me that. Darkroom takes living human beings with thoughts and memories and hopes and dreams and twists and converts them into shells of themselves, purely for the entertainment of the masses who thrive on carnage and murder, the true, disgusting, and feral unravelling of the human race distilled in a single stream which will make you want more. I have a lot to tell you and not much time so buckle up. Let’s hope these screens above me don’t turn on, and I can finish this post without losing my mind.

Seven hours earlier, I was in a way better position than I am in now.

“Wait, you’re hanging with a streamer?” 

Jet's voice was a relief in my ear. 

"Uh, yeah, you could call him that," I said, stabbing my finger in my mouth. 

Standing in front of my bathroom mirror with my phone lodged against my chin and my index finger once again stroking over my back teeth searching for dental implants, my stomach was twisting. I had a feeling my housemate would question a 17/18-year-old kid knocked out on our lounge floor, and I had no idea how to explain it to him. It had been maybe an hour since one of Darkroom’s top streamers had stopped hysterically laughing. The laughing had gotten so bad, I had no choice but to knock him out. But don’t worry, it was just a clean knock to the head. 

So, with thinning patience, yes, I grabbed the closest thing to me, which was a hollow paperweight that wasn’t too heavy, and slammed it into the back of his skull. 

“Oh, cool! So, like an underground streamer?” 

It didn’t surprise me that Jet was excited. The guy spent most of his time on Twitch when he wasn’t in classes. Jet was my housemate. 

We met in our freshman year of college and decided to move in together in our second year. He was due back home any second, and I was trying to break the news gently, that we had a… guest. I didn’t know what to call him.  

*Streamer* was the first thing that came to mind since he was part of whatever the fuck “Brightwood” was— an underground live stream broadcasting actual murder. 

Millie had known what was going on from the start and still wanted to join Darkroom. She knew it was all real, that Kaz and Elle were real people doing real killing. And she tricked me into almost surrendering myself to the red screen, dragging me down with her.

“Sort of?” That was all I could respond with. 

Whatever this kid was involved in, he definitely was not there willingly. 

I had stopped laughing, thankfully, and there didn’t seem to be any mysterious fillings implanted into my teeth. 

I had lost my best friend inside a room of laughing corpses, accidentally kidnapped one of Brightwood’s most notorious killers, and brought him back to my fucking apartment. Thanks to a comment on my last post, I did end up tying him up with one of Jet’s jump ropes. “So, how famous are we talking?" my housemate enquired. 

There was a bright side. The SUV that had been lurking outside my apartment for most of the day, was finally gone. “He’s just a guy,” I said. “Listen, Jet, maybe it would be a good idea for you to stay with someone for a few days,” Staying on the call, I left the bathroom to check on Felix. The kid was still curled up with his back to me, his wrists still bound in jump rope. My main concern was him waking up, going through my knife drawer, and stabbing me through the head from behind. I didn’t realise it when I posted my last update but the commenters referred to the kid I'd rescued as Kaz Issacs. The Brightwood psycho and one of  Darkroom’s most famous faces whom Millie had been googly eyes over. 

He was the kid standing alongside Elle after bringing a whole town to its knees. 

And I'd brought him to my apartment.  

Regarding the mysterious tooth implant, I was planning on checking it out, but the kid could wake up and go psycho any moment. If he had been brainwashed to be a Brightwood psycho, I had no doubt he wouldn't kill me without a second thought. 

Jet chuckled in response. “You want me to stay away so I miss meeting this mysterious underground streamer? I’m almost home, anyway.  Just picking up snacks,” he paused when I didn't respond, eyeing the paperweight across the room. 

"Clara, what’s going on?”

I could hear the rustling of him fumbling for snacks, politely greeting the store attendant. “Where’s Millie?

I was still trying to figure out how I was going to tell my roommate his girlfriend was most likely dead. My eyes stung at the thought of leaving Millie in that room, her body contorting and twisting. Alone. But she brought me to Darkroom and knew who they really were and what they did. 

She mentioned people in the town being brought up to be killers. I thought she meant in the “fictional” universe of Brightwood. But if this was real, if Brightwood was a real place--then everything she told me that had happened, kids being brought up to be psycho killers, and an “urge” forcing people to kill and an apparent escape by the two main leads Elle and Kaz, was in fact real. She wasn’t a performing streamer in this twisted narrative. Elle was a real person who had discovered her life was a lie and tried to get out. At some point, Elle had found a way out, a breakout into the real world that was no doubt being suppressed. She tried to escape Darkroom. And failed, with the person she trusted the most betraying her. 

I knew that because she was caught and was still part of it today. 

I thought back to her standing on the threshold of the door with an empty smile, vacant eyes staring straight past me. Unlike Felix, Elle's eyes were empty of everything. Like she had given up completely, allowing herself to be completely swallowed up. “Clara?” Jet’s voice was a low hum in my ear. "You've gone quiet." he sighed. "Jeez, there's a weirdo following me around the store. Do you think my good looks are attracting stares?" 

“Following you?” I jumped up, something cold and slimy creeping up my throat. “Who’s following you?”

“Dude, chill, I’m good. I’m pretty sure they’re just joking around.”

“They?”

“Yeah, there’s a group of them pointing their phones at me.”

“Jet,” I said through my teeth. “Leave the store, get in your car, and drive to a friend’s house."

“What?” His tone twisted. “Wait, are you okay?”

I thought about lying to him, but lying could get him hurt and I couldn’t lose two of my closest friends. “I’m in a… situation. But I’m okay. I just need you to stay with a friend. Text me when you’re there, and don't ring me, okay? Just stay away."

Before he could respond with what I could only guess would be sarcasm, I ended the call, pulling the lounge curtains shut and making sure the windows and doors were locked. If they were tracking the kid, then they already had Jet and my identities. Idly scrolling through Reddit comments on my phone, one of them caught my eye. 

*“Pull the filling. Then throw it somewhere far away. That’s how they’re tracking him.”*

It was the last sentence that sent shivers ripping down my spine, which was just confirmation that I was inches from a serial killer. “And his name *is* Kaz Isaccs.” 

Millie told me who Kaz Issacs was. He was the guy who betrayed Elle, her so-called love interest, according to Millie, and an apparent viewer base, who had stood by her side inside the skeleton of their school, standing atop a mountain of mangled bodies. Real bodies. The people of Brightwood were real souls trapped inside a hell. Kaz, or Felix, was insanity let loose, the devil incarnate, according to Millie. He was the embodiment of unravelling humanity. He had killed his own parents, slaughtered a whole town, and was responsible for the dystopian, decrepit underworld Brightwood had become. I thought back to when I first saw him, pushing through what resembled a classroom door, more of a shadow than a human. Before wide-set, dark blue eyes eyes met mine.

Unmoving. 

Feral. 

Like an animal.

Even conscious, he had been mute, frenzied, his fingernails slicing into my flesh. If this boy was Kaz Issacs, with the tattoo on his arm quite literally marking him as Darkroom’s property—then he had a history… one which Millie had linked to town’s people being brought up to be killers. If that was in fact real, and Kaz was the product of engineering from childhood to create the perfect psychopath for whatever Brightwood really was… a shiver slipped down my spine. Then I had to get that thing out of his mouth. Initially, I didn’t want to touch it. But the thing was tracking him, right? And what exactly could a filing do?

The kid was already fucked up, what else could this thing do if I took it out?

Understatement of the fucking century.

Besides, he was tied up. If he went feral, I could knock him out. 

That’s what I told myself as I lowered myself to my knees, crawling over to him. I didn’t have the proper instruments, just a glass thermometer, and a blunt knife I was hoping I wouldn’t have to use. I had an idea of what I was supposed to do. I just had to get it out, right? Gingerly rolling the guy onto his back, I inched towards his mouth with shaking hands. First, I pried his mouth open and attempted to hold it open with a metal ruler.  That worked. Ish. With the flashlight from my phone, I  peered inside his mouth, locating the filing in his back teeth. Looking closer, it was silver in color and looked to be like no other filling I’d seen. I prodded the thing with the thermometer, almost jumping out of my skin when the boy's head lurched, his eyes flickering. This time with the scissors, I prodded again and attempted to carve a way into the filling, but the thing was rock solid, drilled into his tooth. “Ahh warghhhdent dwoo warghht whiff warghh warghh whurgh.” The muffled voice took me by surprise. *I wouldn't do that if I were you*. I almost jumped out of my skin. The kid was wide awake, unfocused greyish blue eyes peering at me. He rolled them. “Uhhwesh whargh hwav arghh fwukin thweth thwish.” *Unless you have a fucking death wish*. The boy gestured to himself with his eyes. *Can you get this out of my mouth?!*

The guy seemed… normal. When I yanked out the thing wedged between his teeth, his mouth snapped shut, his body jolting like he'd been shocked. The boy spluttered out what sounded like a laugh before he must have gained control, a thin line of scarlet dribbling down his chin. He eyed me with a scowl. "Get me the sharpest knife you have, and your phone.” The guy wiggled in his restraints, attempting to roll over onto his side. "You didn't have to tie me up."

“You were laughing and you wouldn’t stop. I had to tie you up to stop you from hurting yourself.”

His eyes narrowed. "You were that girl standing outside The Purple Room."

"You remember me?" 

"Yeah. They sent me to the Yellow Room for not getting any kills.” His blinked rapidly. “More so,” Inclining his head, the boy regarded me with confusion. “How were you in the right place at the right time? You’re not a Darkroom OG or even one of the brainless idiots who come to us voluntarily for clout. The Purple Room is strictly for us, and the doors surrounding it are always locked so if we escape the first room, the guards can grab us before we make it out into the main building and escape.” He curled his lip, attempting to sit up and failing. "Darkroom is crawling with security, and I should know, I made one of those rooms when I was a kid.” His half-lidded eyes strayed on me. “So, how exactly did you end up right in front of The Purple Room?” The guy slowly drank in my lounge with wide eyes. “And why bring me back to your house?” He surprised me with a sarcastic laugh which took me off guard. 

“Dude, do you even know who I am?" 

“Kaz.”

“Nope.”

“Felix?”

“Try again."

“You almost killed me," I hissed out. 

He arched his brow. “Of course I tried to kill you, do you even watch Brightwood? What’s your name?”

“Clara,” I said. “I  escaped one of their rooms, and I panicked. You were right in front of me and you looked like you needed help. And in your psycho state, you grabbed me and pulled me with you.” 

I could feel myself slowly inching away from him. His eyes darkened. “I’m still deciding for myself but that could change at any moment, so get me your phone and the sharpest knife you have. Do it quickly."

I shook my head. “I’m not untying you. You knocked me out with a metal pipe.”

Felix rolled his eyes with a scoff. “All right, fine. You can rip out my trackers,” he stretched out on the rug, nudging me with his leg. “I’ve got two in either ankle and another two in my wrists. They’re paranoid these days after our grand escape in April.”

Something ice-cold slithered down my spine. Millie told me about the escape stream. “You tried to escape with Elle?"

“In a way,” he pressed his face into the floor, muffling his words. “Listen, I would love to chat about my sad, tragic backstory, but you need to get my trackers out or they’ll come for me.” The boy lifted his head. “Judging from your facial expression, you’re already worried. These guys aren’t to be messed around with, and they need me. So, if you don’t want men in black bursting through your door, get me a knife, let me cut out my trackers, and then I will tell you everything I know.” He wrinkled his nose. “Also, I need your phone to sign into my Darkroom account. If I’m missing, they’ll be informing my crazy followers." Before I could speak, he sighed, curling into himself. “If I wanted to kill you, you would already be dead. Give me your phone and a knife, unless you want my followers to rip out your guts."

I’m not sure how I ended up in my bedroom, pulling out the sharpest knife I could find from my hidden stash under my bed. I untied him and passed him the knife, averting my eyes while he slashed at his wrists and ankles with not much of a whimper. It was when blood was starting to pool on my lounge floor, did I looked up from my phone where I was trying to find the Darkroom app, which didn’t seem to be in any search engine or app store. 

I was expecting tiny devices embedded into his skin, but when I lifted my head, the guy was slicing deep into his flesh and scooping out large bug-like things with red flashing lights, still connected to thin wires attached to his flesh. Jesus Christ. This shit was inhumane. He stamped on them, doing the same to his ankles, digging the blade into the curves of his feet, and I had to resist a cry not to get blood on my rug. When he was finished, the boy easily patched up his wounds without complaining or crying, humming to himself, and I had a hard time understanding how he wasn’t writhing in agony. And then it hit me like ice-cold water. Whatever these kids had been through, slashing open their own wrists and ankles must have been a breeze. When Kaz, or Felix, hovered the blade in front of his eye, wrinkling his nose, seemingly trying to get a good trajectory, I snatched it off him with a hiss. 

“What the fuck are you doing?!”

The boy didn't blink. He didn’t look annoyed or angry. This kid had zero emotion. “They’re watching us,” he said. “Give me your phone and I'll show you."

“What?!”

He held out his bandaged hand. “Give. Me. Your. Phone.”

I did, following him around as he paced my lounge, his eyes glued to my iPhone. “Wait, if you sign into your account, won’t you be signalling to them where you are?”

He scoffed, typing something into my phone. “They already know where we are.” Felix shoved my phone screen in my face, and I glimpsed what looked like a live feed of… my face. I stumbled back, and so did the version of me on the screen. I could see my lounge and surrounding furniture, the seeping red stemming on the floor. I opened my mouth to speak, but Felix was already dragging away the phone and prodding his left eye. “Two million people are watching your face right now, so why not give them a smile,” he murmured, sticking his index directly into his eye, a shadow shading the screen. “Through me. I had this thing installed when I was deep into Darkroom and started doing live shows. I even live streamed kidnapping Elle, when I first brought her Into Darkroom." Felix blinked for confirmation, and so did the stream. When I peered at the feed, I could see the chat coming down the screen, a plethora of capitals and emoji’s demanding to know where Kaz Issacs had gone. 

Felix shot me a sickly smile, his eyes glued to the phone. 

“It gets worse.” He showed me another stream with the same amount of views. This time a blonde girl was sitting cross-legged on a pink bedspread. It didn’t take me long to realise who it was. Elle. The girl was eating candy from a bag, and in front of her was her dismembered mother severed into pieces. It took me a moment to register what she was doing, and what was in her other hand which wasn’t holding the bag of candy. With a wide grin and half-lidded eyes, Elle stuck the blade of a saw into her mother's skull and began cutting, slicing it into pieces, her gaze never leaving the screen, her grin splitting her lips into a horrifying, grotesque sight. The chat on screen was going crazy, voting on what piece would be cut off next, revelling in what they were seeing. The girl moved slowly and methodically, knowing exactly which piece would take time and which would come off with no problem. I When Elle delved her hands into the cavern of her mother’s skull and pulled the brain from its root, finally speaking in a low murmur, only saying, “Where is Kaz?” much to her delighted chat, I twisted around, choking up my stomach lining. 

“Turn it off!!" 

Felix hummed, his gaze glued to the phone. “That’s not going to stop the stream. She’s leading the search party, ordering her followers to come and find Kaz Issacs. Who also happens to be me."

"What happened to her?" I swiped at my mouth. 

He folded his arms. “Oh, because she seemed completely okay and mentally stable the last time you saw her?"

“But you tried to escape, right?”

Felix nodded, and I glimpsed a prick of emotion wrinkling his otherwise nonchalant expression. “Yeah. Annalise Duval opened our eyes to what was real, and I found out my real self was a raging psychopath who was quite literally made for Brightwood.”

“Annalise?”

That name was familiar. The mention of her name seemed to snap something inside of him. “Yeah,” Felix said in a breath. “But I… I don’t want to talk about her. Not right now.” He wouldn’t look me in the eye, his expression suddenly haunted, and hollow. “Annalise Duval was Elle’s real sister. The sister she had before Darkroom took her." He wrinkled his brows. "I never knew her real name."

“What happened to her?”

“Didn’t I just say I don’t want to talk about it?” He snapped, his lip curling. “Elle lost her, okay? She lost me. So, she gave into them.”

I noticed his hands were shaking. No matter how hard this kid was trying to appear inhuman, the caricature he was forced to be on screen—I knew some of him was still there, even if it was the tiniest lingering piece of humanity. “She gave up.” Was all he said in a sharp breath. “Elle realised that she couldn’t save me or herself, and that broke her. Which was exactly what Darkroom wanted. They wanted her to shatter, and give in to Brightwood, accepting her role as Elle."

“Because you betrayed her.”

Felix shook his head, real emotion and feeling finally creasing his expression. “That wasn’t…” he scrubbed at his face with a groan, clawing at his eyes with his nails. “Do you know how hard it is to keep coming back?” He hissed. “When they cut into me and promise me they’ll fix this glitch in my brain which won’t let me sleep—and yeah, they manage it. But it never fucking sticks.” The phone slipped from his hands, and he dropped to his knees in the first vulnerable position I had seen him in. This kid was traumatised, wrapping his arms around his knees, and staring forwards into nothing, his jaw set. “I appear to be fixed on the outside, sure. The bigwigs congratulate themselves after drilling into my mouth, and my brain, trying to turn me into the perfect monster. I’m exactly who they’ve wanted me to be, my original self who they made for the sole purpose of Brightwood.” His eyes were glittering with tears, but he swiped at them angrily, trembling. “I don't know why I'm crying, I'm not allowed to cry,” he whispered. “I’m… I’m not allowed to cry. I can't.. I can't cry." When I lowered myself to try and help him, he shuffled away from me like a frenzied animal, his eyes wide. “They…they said I can’t cry, or they’ll hurt me. I have to laugh. I laugh at everything, and that's what they want. Darkroom, and my followers." 

There was a certain vacancy in his eyes, before he blinked it away. “I betrayed her and I didn’t give a fuck. I laughed in her face and gave Darkroom some of their best views they have ever had. But then I…” He choked out a laugh.  "I keep coming back! I keep coming back with my memories, and my emotions—what they tried to take them away, and what they keep trying to cut out and carve from my mind… it never goes away. I have... regret. I have emotions and feelings, and pain. I cry! I cry when I'm not allowed to. I want to claw out my own eyes, and I want to scream and cry and tell Elle that I will get her and the others out of there.” He slammed his fists into his temples. "But that's not me. That's Kaz. Fucking. Issacs.”

Felix shuddered. “He won’t leave me alone. The bastard is a coward. He cries and screams, and tries to fight. He won’t let me sleep—and because of him, because of him holding on, I can’t be who they want me to be. I mean, do you think I want to feel? After everything they did to me as a kid, I shouldn’t be able to, but I do. I do, and it… it fucking hurts. They told me to laugh at pain and not to dare cry, but Kaz won’t fucking let me. He’s a disease.” 

Felix buried his head in his lap. “So they hurt me. They…  they cut me open and make me remember every cut and slice, every time they throw me into the Redroom and twist my thoughts. He always comes back. He won’t let me give into it… like her. They even cut directly into my brain to take him out!” He sputtered. “So, that must have worked, right? Oh, yeah, it did. Darkroom got their views when I turned my back on Elle after being brainwashed right in front of her and then tricking her into believing that I was okay—only for the climax, where I revealed I was fucking with her the whole time. People were glued to their seats."

He swiped at his eyes again, which made me believe he really was fighting this other (?) version of himself. “And I was okay for a while. I was exactly who they needed me to be. I played into their game, and Elle was broken. I was a mindless monster who started a new arc in Brightwood, going on a fucking murder spree, and what happens?” He laughed incredulously. “I woke up! I keep waking up after they try to fix me. And that IDIOT," He prodded at his temples, "Is still there. I wake up to people I have killed and names and faces in my head who used to be my friends. Darkroom makes me kill them for views, and as a mindless puppet, I do. When they force us into those colored rooms—the purple room to crack open our minds, and the red room to empty us out,” He got to his feet slowly, swaying from side-to-side. “I shouldn’t care, right? I shouldn’t care that Sim’s blood still stains my hands, and Johnny’s decapitated body is being used as a fucking prop. I should laugh like Elle.” 

He took a step toward me, and I found myself staggering back. “But I do care.” Felix took my phone, his tone softening. 

“Kaz does, so I do too."

I eventually found my voice. “But isn’t Kaz…” I trailed off, unsure what to say.

Felix shook his head, his gaze flicking to my phone. “I know what you’re going to say, and the answer is no. Kaz was who I was supposed to be, an AI personality embedded inside me via a tooth implant.” He pointed at it. “Initially, it was to trick the audience into thinking I was this harmless guy hanging around Elle with zero bad intention,” he sighed. “But then the implant poisoned me, and I started to think I really was this sixteen-year-old jock living in a town where murder was legal,” Felix side-eyed me. “The only reason why I woke up was when the implant was physically torn from my mouth. Which was Kaz. That woke me up for a while, and I was myself again. But Kaz lingered like sour fucking milk. He gave me my humanity back. Which gave me sympathy toward Elle and made me actually want to escape, and regret what I did to Annalise. Kaz was gone, or at least the tooth implant was gone, but the asshole had already poisoned right through me, my brain, my blood and bones. He had completely taken me over. They tried to bring me back and destroy him, but it was too late. Kaz was officially a part of my mind and has not left me since.” Felix chuckled, lifting his head, his eyes red. “Which is why I haven’t killed you yet.” He stabbed at his teeth. “The thing you tried to get out? That is currently stabilising both of us. If it gets taken out, I come out full force and will kill you, dismembering you without a second thought.”

“So, you were made… from birth?”

He frowned at me, his lip curling. “I’m not a test-tube baby. I was eight years old when they took me and turned me into… this. Before Brightwood and even Kaz, I was one of the little kids they broadcasted to the world to prove that children could be psychotic killers."

I swallowed. “You were…”

“Brainwashed.” He finished. “Yes. Brutally. I didn’t even know until they revealed it when I was fifteen. They were in control of me my whole life, a whole Truman Show-like vibe, and I had no idea until I tore apart my brother and father in a fugue state, who were acting the whole time." 

“Acting?!”

“Let’s not go there,” he murmured. “Childhood trauma. It might trigger the implant to dislodge, and neither of us wants this thing to revert to default."

“But why would they be stabilising you right now if they want you to be a murderer?”

His lips curved into a smirk. “It’s not supposed to be stabilising Kaz. It should have been suppressing him, but he took over as usual. I was halfway through a Brightwood stream when he woke up. So, they threw me into the laughing track room to prepare me for yet another attempt at cutting him out. The laughing track room makes a human lack track—but it also sends OG’s into a hysterical trance in preparation for  the red room. Elle was questioning if Kaz was awake when I saw the door was unlocked, took a chance, and ran for my fucking life."

“Right.” I bit into my lip. “So, you could revert back to your original self at any minute and rip my head off of my shoulders.”

The boy inclined his head, and I spied the tattoo still printed onto his arm. Property of Darkroom. “That depends if they think you're entertaining. If you can kill someone without breaking a sweat, they might develop an interest."

Felix’s expression darkened when his gaze flicked back to my phone screen. 

“Elle’s playing a new game."

“Meaning?”             

"She's hunting me down," He showed me the screen of my phone. “Do you know him by any chance?"

Looking closer, the writhing legs of a phantom spider entwined around my spine. I found myself staring at a blindfolded and gagged guy with his arms bound behind his back. Kneeling on silver flooring, it looked like he was in the back of a moving van. I recognised dark brown curls and freckles. Jet looked barely conscious, his eyes half lidded. “That's my housemate,” I said in a breath. There was a masked figure behind Jet, a girl with golden hair poking from the mask. She had a gun pressed into the back of his head, teasing the trigger. Felix tapped onto Elle’s stream, and the girl leaned into the camera with a wide, childish grin. There was nothing behind Elle's eyes, and looking at Felix, I could tell this was the reason why he hated waking up. The boy stumbled back with a hiss, and Elle’s smile widened. She liked seeing him with emotion. I think it thrilled her to watch him in pain. “Give him back!" she sang, "Or I will blow a hole through pretty boy's head."

“She’s got Jet.” I said in a hysterical hiss. 

"I know.”

“Because she wants you.”

He twisted around to look at me, and I caught my frantic expression on stream. "I know!" 

A sudden BANG made me jump.

Thundering footsteps came from outside. 

I inched toward my door and peered out, glimpsing a sea of phone lights accompanying shadows gathering outside my apartment. Felix was behind me, pressing his face against the glass. “Looks like Elle’s sent her followers, and she won’t stop until I’m back there,” he hissed out. “They twisted and contorted her mind to think she loves me—in an extremely fucked up way. It's not like before when it was… natural and felt right. This is obsessive and insane. It's all for an audience, but she's the one suffering. This is what they did to her. They made her like me. They turned her into Felix Delacroix, or perhaps an even fucking worse version."

I couldn't breathe, my heart in my throat. "How do we get away?" 

"I don't… I don't know."

My next actions surprised even me, but it's like I was possessed. 

With Felix caught off guard, I grabbed the knife and the boy, pulling him to his feet and sticking the blade in his throat. The phone dropped out of his hands, and I kicked it away from him before he could grasp it. "Clara, I'm really not the one you should be threatening right now," he gritted out. 

I had already lost Millie to these people. 

I watched her die. 

There was no way I was losing Jet too. 

“If I give you to them… they’ll let him go, right? You’re a psycho, anyway. You killed people. You butchered an entire town.” I choked out a laugh. “Jet? He's innocent. He doesn’t deserve this. You’re the one Darkroom wants."

“Oh yeah, blame the brainwashed footsoldier,” Felix gritted out, struggling when he realised I wasn’t playing around, or was doing this for show.   “They’re going to kill you anyway, and then claim me as the prize. This is just a game to them and you’re playing right into their trap. Do you think they're actually giving you an ultimatum? Clara, these people kill for the thrill. For fun. She's killing him whether you give me to them or not. That's what Brightwood is. That's that our viewers want."

“No,” I said. “Because what if I kill you? They’re obsessed with you, right?" 

I twisted the boy around to look at me, so the two million eyes could see and hear me. In the corner of my eye, through the glass of my door, one shadow pulled out a chainsaw and revved it, the group of them roaring with laughter. In my panic, I stabbed the blade into Felix’s throat, drawing blood. “Do you hear me, Elle? Let my friend go, or I will cut Kaz Issacs’s throat open. I'll kill him. And then what will you do?"

“Careful, you stupid bitch," Felix’s voice twisted into a snarl, creeping its way into my head. His hands grasped for  the knife, thrusting the blade further into his throat, like he was challenging me. “You’re starting to sound like a Brightwood resident—and trust me, the last thing you want to do is impress them." His voice trickled into a maniacal giggle sending shivers creeping their way down my spine. 

"Was that… the original you?"

"Nah. I just think you're an idiot." He hissed out. "You need to snap out of it. She's in your head, Clara. Push her out!"

“How about a counteroffer?” 

Elle’s voice surprised both of us, and I wrestled to get a hold of the phone with one hand, keeping a hold of the squirming guy with the other. Something had snapped in him, causing him to heave out hysterical laughter, trembling in my arms, head tipped back. The live feed kept switching to the POV of Jet on his knees. 

Elle’s voice was a giggly sing-song, and glued to her words, hypnotised by her fake promise, I followed her instructions, my hands grasping for the knife, and sticking the blade inside Felix's mouth. He struggled violently, but all I could see was a sea of red in front of my eyes, slowly drowning me. He felt weightless when I pinned him against the wall, Elle's smile taking over my lips. Her thoughts tangled on my tongue. *“Why don't you grab some pliers, get that mean and nasty implant out of his mouth, and I won’t kill your friend like I’m planning to. I’ll let both of you go."*

…

This is all I can write for now.

It’s getting kind of cold in here, and the peeker in the vent is yet to come back. I hope she does before these screens turn on.
