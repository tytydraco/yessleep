Hello r/nosleep my name is Joshua, and I'm here to tell that my life is fucking strange. 

You see, there are plenty of weird happenings that occur in our world, and they rarely make any sense. They’re downright incomprehensible, they make your skin crawl, and they make your stomach feel like there is an endless pit inside of you.  


I experience more strangeness than anyone else in the world. You can consider me a bad omen. I always wondered what makes me so eccentric. What’s the reason for all of it? Does there even need to be one?  
  
If there’s one thing I hate, it’s being a bystander to the oddities that occur around me. The emotional distress that comes with viewing and experiencing such weird things is enough to make any sane man put a bullet in his head. I had to constantly remind myself that I wasn’t crazy.   
  
But nothing bad ever seems to happen to me. I’m kept out of harm’s way and physically immune.  
  
I’ve only ever been the focal point once back at the beginning. I guess you can say I was “infected” or “touched.” Maybe I was always this way, and that day was simply the first time I took notice.   
  
There’s this alleyway I used to cut through when I was coming to and from school. I’ve walked down it more times than I can count. But on one particular walk, I suddenly felt enclosed. It was like I was trapped inside a small box that rapidly compressed.   
  
I started hyperventilating.  
  
I wanted to turn around and take the long way home to avoid whatever was happening, but it felt like there was no alternative. Whether I take this path today, tomorrow, or three months from now, it will eventually draw me back so that I can see whatever needs to be seen.  
  
I tried to compose myself. But even then, I knew it was pointless. Swallowing my fear, I walked forward into the ominous alley. Halfway down, an awful smell filled the air, stinging my eyes and throat. I felt bile rise as I approached a dumpster swarming with flies. Against my instincts, I slowly turned around.  
  
I was met with a horrific sight. A vagrant, stiff as a mannequin, came into view. His face was angled up and his mouth stretched unnaturally wide while the limbs twisted at impossible angles.   
  
He was dead. He had to be…I still don’t know how he managed to cry out for help.   
  
I ran home and told my parents. The police were called, but I didn’t hear any updates for years, at least not until recently. They believed he was murdered and later disposed of at the dumpster, but they were puzzled by how his body deflated like a popped balloon when touched. No one can explain it.  
  
That was the only time I was at the center of incongruity. From then on out, I’ve been a mere bystander, a witness, some crazy guy.  
  
So much shit has happened to me directly or indirectly that I decided…I don’t know…to understand it. I wanted to make sense of it. Am I connected to it? Am I causing it? Am I just a crackbrained individual who’s suffering from some undiagnosed illness?  
  
I just turned 23 and…well I’ve made a significant life-changing decision. Although, if I’m being honest, the decision may have already been decided long before the idea came to fruition.  
  
I have a name for all these weird occurrences that have happened: the Bizarre. They are bona fide experiences layered with incongruous facts. I want to find people who’ve experienced the Bizarre and interview them. Who knows, maybe they can shed some light and help me understand why the Bizarre exists.  
  
I’ll transcribe their stories so that they can be read by you.   
  
You’re welcome to form your own opinion, whether you’re a believer or a skeptic. I genuinely don’t give an ounce of a single fuck. Think whatever you want. I’m not doing this for fame or glory.   
  
I’m as broke as someone can be without being labeled homeless. If you really want to know why I’m doing this, it’s because the world is far more frightening than we know. And someone has gotta make sense of it. Might as well be me.   
  
\---------  
  
I posted a Craigslist ad hoping that someone would message me so that I’d get to conduct my first interview. But after two weeks, I got no responses.   
  
I later posted on a Facebook page called “The Off Center” where odd people go to share their genuine opinions on how the world is not truly ours.   
  
There’s a lot of kooky behavior, so it was right up my alley. I got a couple of DMs and was thrilled when I finally conducted my first interview with Cory M.   
  
After interviewing him, the recordings were mysteriously corrupted. I’m now working on recovering them. Though initially disappointed, I ended up finding another interview at a gas station while en route to meet a different potential lead.  
  
Note how I format the interviewee names based on my online research. It would be made with the first name and then the first initial of the last name. So, mine would be Joshua A for Joshua Ankitz.

Title of Interview: The Truck Driver   
  
Location: Carlsbad, NM  
  
Interview Setting: The interview was conducted on the hood of my car outside a gas station.   
   
Date: 01/10/2024  
  
Attendees: Joshua Angkitz (Interviewer) and Christopher Harmon (Interviewee)    
  
Affiliation with The Bizarre: Claims to have experienced weird phenomena during his tiring career as a truck driver   
  
\[While I was leaving the gas station, I suddenly felt this odd sensation constricting my body and making my nerves go haywire. I ended up bumping into Christopher—a tall, heavyset older man with sunken wrinkled eyes, a buzz cut, and a jolly southern demeanor that was quite overbearing.   
  
Christopher laughed solemnly before quickly apologizing. He’s very jovial in the way he speaks. Despite me bumping into him and causing me to drop my drink, Christopher was very persistent in righting a wrong.  
  
That constricting feeling didn’t depart. It got more intense, causing my head to pound like thunder while white noise slowly encroached in volume. I accepted his offer. Not a split second later, the pounding, that enclosing feeling, and the white noise…they gradually faded altogether.   
  
This was the Bizarre; it had to be.   
  
While we waited in line, we chatted about nonsensical things like life, places he’s visited, and his wife. We chatted until my favorite topic, the Bizarre, rounded its misshaped head. It came up so naturally in our conversation that it felt almost forced.   
  
He agreed to be interviewed.\]   
  
Joshua A: Hold on, Christopher. \[Brief pause.\] I want to make sure this is recording. Got this thing from a pawnshop. \[Laughs.\] Let’s see. Is the light on? Heck yeah! Let’s go. Alright. What is it that you do?  
  
Christopher H: I’m a truck driver.   
  
Joshua A: Awesome. How do you like it?   
  
Christopher H: It pays well. Get to see many things on my many travels. Get to meet interesting people like yourself.   
  
Joshua A: While we were waiting in line, we talked a little about the Bizarre. You’ve driven through the states and traveled through their intricate roads. Have you ever seen something you just can’t explain?   
  
Christopher H: \[His smile drops and he gives me a slim chuckle.\] Yes, I have. I’ve seen a lot of things I can’t explain but hasn’t everyone at least once had that experience? The world is bombastic. Filled with twists and turns that if you were to follow, you’d just end up getting lost.   
  
Joshua A: \[Laughs.\] I’m not under the perception that things happen because things can happen. But what do you think?  
  
Christopher H: I’m just happy to be alive. \[Laughs.\] So, is this what you do? Interview people? Are you with a network?   
  
Joshua A: I wish. This is not a lucrative occupation, Christopher. To answer your question…no, I’m not with any network. But we’re not here to talk about me. Tell me about your Bizarre encounters.  
  
Christopher H: Well alright.   
  
I dedicated 13 years of my life driving through the various roads the states kindly offer. I’ll be the first to tell you about some of these roads; there’s something off about them. You’ll see things that make little sense and hear things your mind will refuse to accept as…what’s the word… tangible?  
  
Joshua A: Can you elaborate?  
  
Christopher H: Let’s see… this one time. I…umm…I heard… laughter.   
  
Joshua A: Laughter?   
  
Christopher H: Sounds silly, right?   
  
Joshua A: Not really. Please proceed.   
  
Christopher H: I had a long drive ahead of me—I always do. \[Laughs.\] I was far from any rest stop or gas station. There was nothing but an empty road in front of me shouldered with thick trees and crowded in a fog.   
  
I’m almost embarrassed to say that I was \[Awkward pause.\] that I was imagining some gigantic creature parting through the trees. Gradually getting closer. \[Laughs.\] I remembered needing to use the bathroom, and so I resorted back to our primitive design. \[Laughs.\]   
  
I parked my semi on the side of the road. It was dark out, and the moon emitted enough of its angelic light to pave the way for my next step. A dense fog surrounded the trees. It looked like the entire forest was alive—like it was breathing.   
  
I hadn’t seen another car for hours, so I relieved myself then and there…I then…I suddenly felt…uncomfortable, like I was being watched.   
  
The fog made things hard to see. But as my eyes scanned the surroundings, I noticed something off in the distance: Two golden slits, short, snake-like, and unmoving while staring at me.   
  
At first, I thought it was an animal like a bear or maybe even a deer. But then I heard laughter. It sounded forced and painful, a gut-wrenching laugh that raised the hairs on the back of my neck. Just recalling this event is giving me goosebumps.   
  
Joshua A: You’re not the only one. Jesus, that must’ve been frightening. Was it only laughter you heard?  
  
Christopher H: I caught a whiff of rancid smells. Spoiled…everything: eggs, milk, a deceased person.   
  
\[I’m taken aback, but just for a moment.\]  
  
Christopher H: Yeah. The laughter never faded, only got more boisterous, excruciating even. But I could tell that it was a man’s laugh.  
  
But you see, no man should be able to laugh like that. Crackling that long without pause, I can’t even imagine what that would feel like.   
  
Terrified, I…I froze. This…this was something backassward, Y’know. Devoid of normality. \[Long pause.\] I…I think what got to me the most…was…that the unseen man spoke.   
  
His voice complemented his warped laughter.   
  
He said…uh. He said, “Would you mind lending me a hand.” He snickered. “Oh, it looks like someone beat me to it.” His laugh became manic. He wheezed and howled as if he’d told the funniest joke of all time. Normally at a comment like that, I’d just punch the bastard who said it. But I just stood there, unable to do a damn thing. Whoever or whatever was out there, they didn’t stop.   
  
They fucking continued. “You’re a funny-looking man, aren’t ya? How about we come face to face? I want to get a good look at you, stumpy.”   
  
“Does your wife think of you as less of a man?”   
  
“Come on, I know you want to hit me. Do to me what your pops did to you.”   
  
With each crude and heartless comment, I imagined the unseen man smiling from ear to ear. He wanted a reaction out of me. \[Heavy sigh.\] I was close to giving him one but thought it best to withdraw myself.   
  
\[Christopher pauses, glancing at his amputated left arm. Misery claws at his face.\]  
  
Christopher H: This…\[He gestures with his other hand, pointing at his amputation.\] used to fill me with dread. I used to think I was less of a man because of it. \[Smiles.\] But if it wasn’t for this, I would have never lived the life I was intended to live. I would have never met the most beautiful woman in the world. I probably would have never lived in general.   
  
Joshua A: I’m happy to hear that, Christopher.   
  
\[We chat about non-Bizarre-related things before we get back on track.\]  
  
Christopher H: Rest stops are beyond terrifying. Every time I’m forced to sleep in one, I get these nervous tics. People think we truck drivers are always hauling expensive crap like flat screens, dishwashers, and iPhones. \[Laughs.\] Joshua, look over there. \[Christopher points at a blue semi-truck.\] What do you think I’m hauling?   
  
Joshua A: Given your tone, I’m going to say nothing worth stealing.   
  
Christopher H: You’re smarter than half of the idiots who think otherwise. I’m hauling paper. \[Laughs.\] It’s just blank sheets of paper for a company down in Pennsylvania. Imagine breaking into my semi, hoping to find something expensive and worth stealing, and then…BANG. \[He smacks the hood of my car; a small dent forms.\] So…sorry.   
  
Joshua A: That’s fine. It’s a better car anyway.   
  
Christopher H: You get the gist of things. There are these thieves, however, that we call “Area Prowlers.” There are usually eight to 10 Area Prowlers wandering rest areas. They walk during the day and attack at night.   
  
They’ll slash all the tires, forcibly enter, and most of the time just ruffle the drivers. Y’know, they will pin them to the ground and that sort of thing, nothing life-threatening.   
  
Some of them take it too far though. Shit, I’m under the impression that some of them purposely go out of their way to grievously harm the drivers.   
  
Joshua A: Holy shit. That’s awful!   
  
Christopher H: \[Sighs.\] Not much we can do besides take precautions. When sleeping, I loop the seat belt through the wheel so no one can open the doors easily. It’s ample time for me to get my gun. However, there have been a few instances involving…what you call the Bizarre.   
  
I remember this one time. I think I woke up at around 2 AM. It was dark out, and the clouds shielded the moon. But a little bit of its light bled through. I can recall this fluttering noise, like a bird flapping its wings. It was quiet at first, but then it got a little louder.  
  
I have curtains up while I sleep, and it’s a good thing that I do. I hate to think that some guy is staring at me while I’m asleep. It makes you feel vulnerable, y’know.   
  
Anyway, whatever made that sound, it flew around the lot. I peered outside. I couldn’t see a damn thing until I looked up.   
  
Something pierced through the clouds. I saw what I think was a…a beak? I don’t know.  
  
Whatever it was, it circled the lot for a good minute before it flew away. This is probably one of the least frightening things I’ve experienced, but it stays with you. Y’know?   
  
Joshua A: And what would be your most frightening?  
  
\[Christopher pauses for a moment; his eyes go blank as if he’s reliving all the Bizarre experiences he’s encountered and ranking them quickly by how scared he was at that given moment.   
  
Staring into his blank face, all I see staring back at me is an empty husk. The first thing that comes to life is his eyes. They glisten, and tears start to form. He lets out this dry breath of uneasiness as he rubs the back of his neck.\]   
  
Christopher H: There’s only ever been one experience that has genuinely scared the shit out of me. Because I don’t know if it really happened.   
  
During the first few months of my employment, I was scheduled for a long drive from Minnesota to New York. Along the way, I must’ve picked up a hitchhiker.   
  
A 19-year-old, redheaded girl that was slim and tall, with black fingernails. The reason I said “must’ve” was because I couldn’t remember picking her up.   
  
I’m a big talker and I always like to fill in the silences. I turned to look at her. Her face was covered by her red hair and I noticed her fiddling with a ring. I…I remember her turning to face me but…I don’t know. I’d blink and suddenly, I was staring back at the road.   
  
“Where are you heading again?” I asked for what felt like the hundredth time.   
  
“We’ll get there eventually, just keep heading straight,” she said softly.   
  
“Ok,” I stammered out, “So, what’s a girl like you doing all the way out here?”  
  
“Sightseeing,” she said weakly.  
  
“There ain’t much to see besides farms and livestock,” I said. I remember her tilting her head towards me. Just as our eyes were about to meet, I was suddenly staring at the road again.   
  
“Does it hurt?” she said. I was confused by her question so I asked, “Does what hurt?”   
  
“Forgetting.” Her voice was filled with dejection as she continued, “It’s like a scar that doesn’t go away. It only gets bigger and bigger. And for whatever reason, you can’t seem to remember how exactly you got it, but you know it’s there. My life is teeming with forgetfulness. Sometimes, I wish I could forget like everyone else.”  
  
I was only getting more confused. I remembered my head pounding. My thoughts were a distance away and the base of my neck tightened. I…I umm…I remembered saying something, but I can’t remember what.   
  
Turning to face her again, I was brought back to the road, except this time it was dark out. “You’re bleeding?” she said, “I’m sorry.”  
  
I wiped away the blood off my nose with a napkin I don’t remember reaching for.   
  
“I’m so sorry. I can’t control it,” she said in a weakened voice.   
  
“Control what?” I remembered muttering.   
  
“You wouldn’t understand,” she said, “I can tell you everything, but what’s the point? It’s not like you’ll remember it anyway.” I think I heard her sniffle, but I can’t remember correctly.   
  
“Maybe you’re right?” she then said.   
  
“Right about what,” I responded. Suddenly, the road in front of me wasn’t the same road I was on a second ago.   
  
She sighed then placed a hand on my lap. “You’re a weird one, Christopher. I like weird, it suits you. I haven’t spoken to someone this long in a while. I hope you remember some of what we chatted about. But if you don’t, that’s okay. I’ll remember for both of us. A little word of advice? Don’t prolong the idea of marriage. Jen sounds like a nice girl, I know she’ll say yes.”   
  
I remember that just as she said those last words, we were suddenly parked on a street. She ran her hands through her hair and she thanked me before walking away.  
  
“You’re welcome,” I muttered. I saw her walking down the street from my side-view mirror. At the moment I lost sight of her, I was suddenly at a diner. A puzzled server tapped on the table to get my attention and asked if I was okay. Honestly, I couldn’t for the life of me answer that question.   
  
It may not seem that frightening, but for me…well, I guess you can say that I found the scar.   
  
\---------  
  
Our interview abruptly ended there as Christopher had to leave. I thanked him for the drink and the interview. I then hopped back inside my car and turned the ignition. But as I was about to drive off, I noticed something peculiar in the rearview mirror.   
  
A small shining orb floated in the middle of the road. Passing cars would phase through it as if it wasn’t there. For some bizarre reason, it felt like it was watching me.   
  
Twisting my head to look at the orb, it was suddenly gone. I glanced back at the rearview mirror. It wasn’t there either.  
  
I’ve seen weird things, but that orb…that’s a [first](https://www.reddit.com/user/Johny_MP/comments/1953gf8/welcome_readers_new_and_old/).
