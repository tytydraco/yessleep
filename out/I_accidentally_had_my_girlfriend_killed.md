It all started about a week ago, I'd heard about the darkweb and seen a few news articles referring to Hitman, Drugs and all the other nefarious activity you can think of but me being me, I was skeptical, I mean how could the government release a tool for anonymity yet allow all this criminal activity to go on.

So I decided to download the browser and dive into it my first couple of days into the darkweb were really not that bad I came across the odd gore site and the odd black market but nothing like Hitmen until Wednesday the 4th of February, her birthday, after the party I jumped back on my laptop and jumped into a couple of chat rooms and that's where I found the user smogikas.

At first he or she never really let anything go until I slipped up and mentioned as a joke I wanted to hire a hitman to kill my girlfriend, as the chat went on and on, I realised what was happening, he/she would charge me 20000, 10000 before and 10000 after. At first I thought he/she was just messing with me until he/she went from being semi friendly to outright angry.

He/she started threatening me and maybe I shouldn't have poked the bear by taking the Mickey but I thought it was a joke, that's when he/she wrote my name, address and a few other details about me, right there in the private message box, my heart skipped a beat and I started feeling nauseous.

I tried apologizing but he/she wasn't having any of it and he/she bluntly wrote "You will see the truth with your own eyes shortly, I hope this will be one of your life lessons"

And the chat ended abruptly, I tried playing it off as a joke or an elaborate troll, maybe he was the admin of the site and maybe it was just a joke because I'm a newbie to the darkweb, maybe it was there way of scaring idiots and whatnot away from there.

Yesterday is when it happened, I got up and my daily routine just fell into place until about 11:00am when I received a call from the local authorities

"Hello is this ******"

"Yes it is how can I help?" 

"Your partner has been in an accident, we need you to come to the hospital"

"Wha...what happened, wha... What do you mean, what are you talking about, who is this?"

"I know this is shocking news but this is PC Steven *********, and I would like you to attend the hospital so we can discuss things further."

"Oooo...ok I'm on the way."

I went straight to the hospital and spoke to the officer and he told me that the breakline on her car showed some kind of tampering and right now they are investigating me for it, i don't know what to do if I tell them will I be charged with her murder, if I keep it a secret will it destroy me, what did I do, what do I do now, I'm all alone and it's my fault.
