For nine years now my bodily functions have been 'haunted', or something. By something. "Nobody ever died from the hiccups!", you might say, and laugh. Well don't laugh, because I almost did.



The first time it happened I didn't even know for sure that something was wrong. I was at a bus stop. I hiccupped and looked up from my book and suddenly I was completely alone. The bus arrived, I took my seat but noticed as I looked back through the window that the stop had filled up again with what appeared to be the same crowd that had stood there when I arrived.



I rode the handful of stops from my apartment to the grocery store, stepped off, and saluted my driver. It was dark and soggy, the ground full of rivers gushing into one storm drain or another. I liked this weather and would have walked but I knew that my paper bags and anything that couldn't fit in my backpack would turn to mush.



Another hiccup. This time, as my throat contracted and sealed and my body involuntarily hitched upward I saw the woman in front of me, her baggage, and the entire bus disappear right out of existence and the world became completely silent. I couldn't see a single person or even a trace of one, just the rain - now silent - bouncing off of the brick buildings and empty storefronts. My heart beat faster. I noticed that something else had changed, too - the walls near me suddenly looked almost like they were made out of wax, and something thin was flowing slowly down the brick. I got closer and stared for a second, trying to see the nature of the flowing substance, and my normal sight was suddenly replaced with a static image of the wall plastering my field of vision. A still-frame picture of what I had been focusing on was now seemingly stuck to my eyes. I shook my head from left to right trying to get the image of the wall unstuck, until I could see normally again. At this point I was panicking. I ran.



I paused at the end of the block, decided to go right, and nearly slammed full-speed into someone carrying their groceries. I stopped hard on my pivot foot and fell on the wet ground. The noise of the rain came back. When I looked back up the street I had come from I saw, upside-down, the woman who had gotten off the bus first slowly making her way up the street behind me. When I sat up I saw that the bus itself had reappeared and was pulling off into the distance.



My hiccup episodes were formulaic. I would feel that tug in my throat, and everything would go silent. Everyone would disappear. I would have to trudge around until I found someone "outside" of the sphere of influence, or whatever, to snap out of the empty wax land. Always silence, flowing walls. My other bodily functions experienced only minor changes - belches (please believe I wanted to use a medical term here but I promise you the medical term for 'belching' is even worse) would result in a brief golden glow washing over the room around me accompanied by a sense of well-being and calmness. I don't believe it ever extended to anyone other than me, but I never asked anyone.



Other than that, this is a fun one - I once let out a little gas while standing in line. High-ceiling room with ventilation, okay? And the trash can behind me spontaneously caught fire. That one I assure you the rest of the world could see. I played it cool while the people around me rushed to put the fire out. I was a little terrified of the implications but eventually I realized that this particular effect only occurred if I was in a social setting and only if others were there to witness it - otherwise, it was just 'business as usual'. The only one that really gave me a sense of dread was the hiccups, and even then I got lucky the first handful of times and found someone to un-hiccup me shortly after. Until - you knew this part was coming, right? - one day.



I was at the library on one of the upper floors. It got late, people more or less had cleared out, but I was wrapped in a new book and didn't notice the crowd thinning. I felt that familiar stomach prelude followed shortly by a 'hic', and prepared for another episode. This time I didn't rush myself, I finished my chapter, and noticed that waxy walls began to take on a slightly darker and more purple shade the longer I spent in this place. I realized that as I remained in this place there was a sense of getting deeper into... something, as time progressed. I checked the corridors and corners of the floor per my now-normal routine, finding no one, and decided to try the elevator down to main. When I went to press the button, sure enough - it was like it was made of wax, it smudged underneath my fingertip and a little bit of it stuck heavy on the end of my finger.



I shook my hand, and just like how the image had stuck to my eyes and then disappeared the wax was suddenly gone, and it reappeared back on the button itself. I walked back towards the staircase and down the flights, hoping that I could catch someone outside to snap me back. Here, even my tinnitus disappeared completely. I couldn't hear the blood flowing through my own head, I couldn't hear the sounds of my own footsteps, I just couldn't hear.



As I made my way down, something caught my eye - a visual disturbance at the corner where the wall met the floor. Whichever part of this intersection between the two planes that I focused on, I could 'see' but not quite see something slowly peeling its way out. I stared too long at one place and my vision glazed over with a static copy again. I shook it off, and when I looked again I could almost see what was beneath the two planes - everywhere I looked, the image moved to the center of my focus, like the afterburn from a bright light except that I could start to make out the details even as it still lay behind the floor and wall. Suddenly I could "see" it in detail, just behind the corner, almost out - and my blood froze. It was a human. I could see its teeth. Right when I felt certain that it would peel the corner apart and enter, I was snapped back. The janitor walked down the stairs, laughing and telling me that the library had closed and that I had almost gotten left behind! He offered to unlock the front door for me and sent me on my way.



After this, I started to take the whole thing a little more seriously. I obeyed certain precautions and protocols, avoided carbonated drinks altogether, familiarized myself with not just my destinations but the places nearby that might yield a supply of people to snatch me back if necessary. I remember exactly how it happened. I was just getting off the subway, biting into my bahn mi sandwich when I felt my teeth pierce the jalapeno seed -



My face flushed bright red, not just with the heat of the seed but also with a kind of jerk-dread-embarrassment reaction knowing that I'd just done something hopelessly wrong and there was no escaping the consequences. I cursed the sandwich maker for her carelessness but it didn't make any difference. My eyes welled up with tears, this from the spice, and I felt the heat take over my throat until the inevitable. One quick and familiar contraction, and I was in wax world at the bottom of the subway station.



I could feel right away that I didn't have much time. Whatever was beneath the corner, it was almost out. I watched as that point between the floor and the wall expanded, the two surfaces forced apart by something invisible wherever my gaze lingered. When the floor and wall peeled back, I could smell rancid blood coming from the gap. And then the gap closed. There was nothing there. I looked to my right, and then I saw that it was already in the room with me - 



It wasn't human, actually. It was human-shaped. It was cloaked, probably eight feet tall hunched over, but the last two of those feet were taken up purely by its head. It had no eyes or a nose, only a set of sharp teeth stretching from the bottom to the top of where the face should have been, with rancid green-gray skin. It stood perfectly still, as if a still-frame of a movie. And then I blinked, and the frame changed. It was closer to me, the arms slightly shifted, as if waving hello. I struggled to keep my eyes from blinking again, backing up towards the stairwell. I failed, blinked again. It was closer. 



I ran for the stairs, keeping it fixed in my vision, trying to pin it down while my eyes watered. I made it to the top of the flight, turned around to find the next means of exit, and it was right in front of me. I fell hard on my ass as it stood motionless, leering, black saliva dripping from the teeth like a dog. It screamed.



As it shrieked, I felt my throat seize upward with a hic -



But there was no release. My throat remained closed completely, I couldn't breathe in or out. I was already winded from the stairs. The sound of the shriek was playing or replaying constantly, filling my brain and I could hear nothing else, and this displaced the silence of wax world until there was no silence remaining. The creature stood motionless over me, its mouth still open and curled into a smile, ready to descend. It was only now that I realized that the scream had frozen me in place, I couldn't move or breathe. I felt the room darken, feeling the lack of oxygen.



I believed at this time that I was going to die there.



Somehow, earlier, it was possible to "shake off" the waxen evil of this place. To free my vision, or body, from whatever had "stuck" it. Unable to move my body, I shook my "thoughts" - shuffled from place to place to object and so on - until I felt the grip on my body falter. I had almost suffocated and the world was nearly black. I crawled up the final staircase leading to the street, not even opening my eyes, not able to think except for conjuring random objects and ideas to keep myself from getting stuck.



The last thing I saw was the boots of someone bending over to help me, at the top of the stairs. I felt my throat release, and passed out anyway.



\* \* \*



It was at this point I decided I had to take a closer look at some of my flaws. If I'm being honest, I was a shut-in. I didn't have many friends. I barely exercised, other than walking, and I didn't have any hobbies that forced me out of my small, isolated comfort zone. The loneliness on its own was bad, now it was possible it could kill me - so I moved into one of the busier parts of the city, got an apartment with roommates, joined clubs, joined sports teams. I came out of my shell. And through careful dietary management and my newfound lifestyle changes I was able to keep my incidents to a minimum and keep my time spent in that other place to almost nothing. It gets better - I even found the love of my life.



We have our story, like any couple, but the bottom line is that she is the only person I've ever confided in with this story until now. She's made me feel comfortable sharing the parts of my life that would make most people experience that awkward stomach turn you get when you realize you've struck up a conversation with someone not attached to this reality. We got married, found our own place, and even sleep in separate rooms in case I have a moment and need someone to ground me. It couldn't be better, or could it? Over time, the more time we spent together, I noticed my minor hauntings gradually begin to taper off. The effects were blunted, wettened, until I stopped noticing some of them at all. I decided to tell my story tonight because, for the first time in over nine years, I had - and I have started to cry while writing this - my first hiccup since the haunting where I remained fully grounded and did not enter the wax world. Ha! I really can't believe it, I am sitting here crying and typing this out and I just can't believe it. Love conquers all indeed? Wow.



I want to thank the love of my life for sticking with me throughout all of my weirdness, for not running away when hearing my story, for putting up with my rigid procedures and dietary restrictions - and I want to sincerely thank you all for reading, from the bottom of my heart. I will forever remember that I shared this moment with you all first, my first moments of being free after nine years. Thank you all for reading this, for being here with me. If anyone is experiencing symptoms like mine, please do not give up hope - I know you will join me on the other side. Hang in there.
