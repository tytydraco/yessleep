I have to tell my story. I know most people won't believe it, but I'm serious. And I'm sorry.

It all started when my wife decided to go to a cabin in the woods, because she was simply too stressed about her work. I also wanted a break, so I took some days out from my job, and she basically booked what I think it's and Airbnb.

We just didn't know it was _that isolated_. Cellphones didn't work, and the closest landline phone was quite of far. So in the first day, she drove to the nearest city, about 10km far, to buy food, water, and everything we could need on out 3-day stay, while I basically made the beds, prepared the place to be... well, livable, etc. She was very happy on how clean the place was.

At that night, unfortunately, the problems started. We woke up startled by something - some weird sound, and shadows, by the window at my side of the bed. I whispered for her to lock the doors, while she looked at me with her eyes full of panic, and then I went to hunt... whatever it was.

It wasn't long since I found a trail. It seemed that something humanoid - or maybe something else - was walking around our house. I could see the footsteps, circling around, and they ended at the basement. Quietly I opened up the door to the basement, and found the lights turned on.

At the basement there were books. Lots and lots of diaries, describing my wife's routine - when she waked up, the time she slept, _how_ she slept, how many times she woke up at night...

I panicked, but I didn't want to make things worse, so I hid the the diaries and tried to mount guard. Every single sound at the woods, and I was there, prepared, to comfront whoever sick pervert was stalking my wife.

At some time, I must have slept, because the next moment, I woke up and went running to the door, checking if my wife was fine. She was sleeping, but woke up the moment I set foot to the cabin, and screamed.

I looked behind me to see a deer just behind me, while she was screaming "Go away! Go away!". I knew it was too much, so I somehow chased the animal, but she didn't stop screaming. I tried to calm her, but my words were being ignored, completely.

\- "Babe... let's stop this, ok. You're not safe here. Let's go back to our home, we can check what to do later"

\- "What are you talking about?? Leave me alone! Are you crazy? Back to home in these conditions? PLEASE, LEAVE ME ALONE!"

Scared, I poured some water to her, tried to stay close, until she could calm down. I saw her tears subsiding, little by little, until she seemed to stop. Still very scared, she looked at me - inquisiting, confused, and then, something else. I could see she was entertaining the idea of leaving early, so she just said:

\- "Ok... let's go home, babe. But please, let me drive. Please?"

I made her promise me that if anything happened, any fear, doubt, we would change. As soon as she felt comfortable, we left the cabin behind - while I was lost in though, thinking on how could I get our money back from our host.

The lack of speed, and the crazyness of the situation started to get to me. I tried to stay awake, but the drowsiness was just too much... until I heard my wife asking me to check my door, because it seemed it was open. I decided to open it and close...

... but as soon as I opened up the door, she... well, pushed me. Hard. We were going quite fast, and I still don't know how I survived. I could see our car speeding away, while I was rolling in the cold asphalt, pain sweeping through my body like I never felt before.

But the worst pain was at my heart. What happened? Unsure what to make of anything, I walked... and walked... for hours, the pain getting worse and worse, until I felt everything fading to black.

I woke up in a hospital. Multiple lacerations and a broken arm, but still alive. Apparently, I was at the middle of nowhere, and the police came to ask me what happened - but I couldn't answer. I still wasn't _sure_ what happened, so I decided to try to contact my wife - without luck. Then I tried to call my family, and ask what was happening...

... which confused me. So, to pass the time, I decided to look at some old photos and videos of us together. With us crying together, living together, our marriage, our plans... but I could not find anything. It seems that my wife never actually existed at this point, and my family... they also didn't know anything about her. Like these wonderful, beautiful five years were never a thing. I called my job too, and they, also, didn't know anything.

Luckily, I found that I was close to the cabin, so I sneaked out of the hospital, still in pain, and was able to call a taxi to the cabin. I took everything I found that night, every evidence, and I found some photos we left behind. I took everything with me, and asked the driver to bring me to the newest hotel...

... which brings me to the point I am right now. After analysing the photos - yes, my wife **was present** on them. But the diaries were a different thing alltogether. I felt I recognized the handwriting, so as soon as the sun rose, I took a bus to my mother's house, and without even asking for her permission began to rummage my old stuff. And what I discovered shook me the bone.

She had a stalker - me.

The handwriting... was mine. When I decided to train my non-dominant hand to write things. I found multiple photos of her in lots of hidden folders in my laptop and my phone - obviously, I'm not present in any of them.

Right now, I'm at the police station. Trying to explain the whole situation the best I could. Obviously, she's already been here, reporting... well, me.

I'm not even sure what to do starting now. Will I be arrested? Will I be send to a sanatorium? Is there even a happy ending for... well, anyone here? I wasn't even aware something was wrong, and in my mind, I am as sane as I always had been... will I become a monster, that will stalk her forever, eventually hurting or killing her in the process?

And the worst part? I still thinks of her as my wife...
