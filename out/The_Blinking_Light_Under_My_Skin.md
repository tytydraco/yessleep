Sometimes I just want to scrap the skin off my body, a constant irritation to my existence. I want to peel it away from my bones and be rid of it. I know that sounds macabre. I don’t mean literally but often I have scraped myself so rigorously that I have left scars just to get relief. I have an undiagnosed itching disease, at least I think this is a disease. It has to be. There’s nothing I can find on the web. Sometimes when I lie in bed, about to descend into unconscious bliss, ready to forgo the responsibilities of the awakened world, an itching spell overcomes my entire body. It’s much worse than the common description of bugs crawling all over your body. It feels like a moving, unreachable, itch under the skin. I scratch one area, only to be cognizant of yet another area that needs scratching. My fingernails are tools without effect, too dull to get the job done. I keep a screwdriver and a pair of scissors on the nightstand beside my bed. Sometimes the finite point of the screwdriver is adequate, other times the broad surface of a scissor blade is needed. I scrap and dig, plowing sharpened edges across my skin with little or no relief.

And yes, I’ve tried medications of every sort. My dermatologist is bewildered and thinks my condition is more akin to a mental disability rather than a physical ailment. She suggested a psychiatrist might be able to help me stop itching. I do not concur.

If the spell drags long into the night and I haven’t slept, I will fill the tub with lavender bubble bath and scalding hot water, get in, and hopefully, fall asleep. In addition, but not on every occasion, I’ll pour myself a little Kentucky Bourbon and sip it until I’m numb to the boiling of my skin. I try not to make a habit of it, but it’s nice to have a spare bottle just in case.

There was a particularly bad night when nothing seemed to work. I had gone through my normal steps of trying to ease my affliction, scratching and bathing and sipping, with no relief. Every inch of my skin itched. When I scratched my legs, I felt an itch in my back. Scratching in one locality, made it universally worse. I decided another bath may do the trick, and maybe instead of sipping, I’ll get straightaway drunk and get some sleep. If I can’t fall asleep, then I’ll pass out.

I know I was in the tub for a long time, for my hands and feet were wrinkled, and usually by that time I had fallen asleep. I was in a state of consciousness between slumber and wakefulness when I noticed a little flashing light under the skin in my forearm. A red point of light blinking fast and then slowing down, a continuous pattern alternating between the two. I immediately felt nauseous, my head spinning, stomach churning, and my ears ringing. I vomited in the tub, not once, but numerous times until the contents of my stomach were empty and then I was dry heaving. This lasted for about an hour. My throat was raw and sore. My stomach muscles were tight, balled up in tension, and then it stopped. My entire body relaxed, and a warm sensation enveloped my body. The light in my forearm was flashing green, slowing fading away, until it was gone.

Needless to say, there was no sleep that night. I tried to call out of work, but my manager told me that I had already used all my time and that another absence would amount to a critical written.  I slugged through the day, checking my arm every now and then to make sure there was no blinking light. Over time my fear subsided, and I reasoned that I was probably drunk. There were the classic symptoms of being shit-faced, except for the blinking light lodged in my skin. Maybe it was a rare hallucination, something I never realized I was prone to, but these things often develop late in life.

And then one day, it happened again. I was at work, running the forklift, and as I turned the steering wheel, I saw the blinking red light. I jumped off the forklift and ran to the bathroom. I started vomiting before I got to the toilet, green beans and regurgitated meatloaf spilled out onto the floor.  I slung open the stall door and crouched down over the toilet.

“Oh shit,” someone said as he walked across my lunch. “Man, are you ok?”

I was unable to give a coherent answer. The only sound I could make was an involuntary gag. The door opened and the mysterious stranger was gone.

Whoever it was must have been seriously concerned with what he witnessed. Dave, my manager, came to check on me.

“John, are you alright? You’ve been off the dock for an hour now.”

I managed to communicate something intelligible as to my assertion that I was in fact not alright. An hour? His sense of time was well removed from reality.

“This must be food poisoning or something. What’d you eat? I guess I’ll take you to the hospital. You think you can stop throwing up before you get in my car?”

The blinking red light slowed and turned green.

“I think I can manage.”

Dave drove me to the emergency room and dropped me off at the door.

“When they’re done with you, call the center and Todd will come pick you up. You’re good with the absence as well. I won’t count it against you for leaving early.”

I turned and lumbered towards the automatic doors. As the doors slid open, I noticed a tall, slender humanoid, dressed in a black robe, standing next to the nurse behind the desk. It was hunched over to fit under the ceiling. It had an elongated skull that split in two at the back of the head and curled in under its cheek lines, a broad face with four eyes and a wide gaping mouth. Its skin was grey, mottled with bright red scars. As it moved its arms they extended well beyond its body and over the top of the desk. The creature reached around the nurse and motioned for me to come forward.

I ran away from the building and to the entrance of the parking lot. I called the center and got an irritated Todd on the phone.

“Already? Dave hasn’t even got back yet. Yeah, I’ll come get ya.”

“Todd, I’ll meet you up at the store. I’m going to get something to drink… something to calm my stomach,” I explained, not wanting to be anywhere near the hospital.

“They didn’t give you anything there?”

“I didn’t go in. I’m fine. Waste of time.”

“Well does that mean you can finish your shift?”

I told him politely that just because I didn’t go inside didn’t mean I was ready to go back to work. I was still sick.

“Whatever. You know we had to clean that shit up,” he answered.

“You cleaned up the vomit?”

“No, but I had to pull someone away from the dock. Now we’re behind.”

I just apologized and asked again if he could come pick me up. It took him two hours to get there.

When I got home, I was determined to cut that damn light out of my skin. I had a good sharp box cutter and a bottle of liquor to quell my inhibitions. I knew exactly where it was located, the light flashing incessantly in my mind. The very thought of it made my stomach queasy.

I took several shots and waited for the effects. I wanted to be numb, not sloppy. I didn’t need to be a precise surgeon, but I sure as hell didn’t want to haphazardly cut in the wrong place. Quick, precise, and without much intrusion. It didn’t seem deep, so I decided to make three incisions, fold the skin back, and pluck it out.

I took another shot. The anticipation of pain was affecting my buzz. I grew impatient with my cowardice, took a large swig from the bottle, placed my arm over the sink, and made three quick cuts. The pain was sharp and excruciating. Blood seeped through the wound, thick and fast, large drops pounding against the porcelain. My flap idea wasn’t as well thought out as I had imagined. The skin didn’t easily fold back and there was too much blood for me to assess the situation. My will was faltering. I didn’t have the fortitude to make another cut. I ran some warm water and put my arm underneath. I had all but made up my mind that I was done, but then as I washed off the blood, I could see that the light was blinking red. My stomach churned, my eyes shook, spots shooting across my field of vision. I started dry heaving, my body jerking violently, throwing blood everywhere.

The sink and floor were a mess. I slipped and fell to the floor, knife still in hand. My mind was overwhelmed with sensations, and none of them good. Instinct took over and I shoved the knife point down through the skin and right into the light. It stuck. The pain in my stomach subsided, but the feeling of the knife in my arm became more acute. The light faded and shut off. I moved the knife vertically, making sure that the light I had snagged didn’t fall off. Ironically, this meant cutting through the flap of skin that had finally separated.  I pulled quickly, cutting and tearing the skin from my wound. Stuck to the end of the knife was a two-inch clear vial, with thick copper ends.

I thoroughly cleaned myself and the bathroom and then bandaged up my wound as best I could, with the hopes of finding something at the pharmacy better than a washrag and duct tape to bind my wound. This would have to wait until morning. It was late into the night, and I was exhausted. I took the bottle of whiskey with me to bed.

Sometime during the night, I felt pressure in my chest. I woke up but unable to move. Standing above me was the creature, his large hand and slender tree limb fingers pinning me to the bed. Each of its four eyes blinking erratically, not in unison, all looking in different directions. The creature was angry. With its other hand, it pointed down at my forearm, shaking its head in disapproval. He then placed his frigid index finger on my eye, and I fell asleep.

The next morning when I awoke, the pain in my arm was unbearable. My makeshift dressing had failed and blood was all over the sheets. I hurried to the bathroom to grab some painkillers and a clean towel. My stomach started to hurt, and the room began to spin. I panicked, snatched the tape off and uncovered the wound. Nothing but a nasty skin carving with congealed blood. The feeling wasn’t like it was before, maybe it was just the stomach flu. The vision in my left eye was a little blurry, but again, I thought, it was nothing as before, but this blurriness persisted. It was a strange sensation, more like a flashing. I turned to look in the mirror and to my horror, I saw a blinking red light just behind the pupil of my left eye.
