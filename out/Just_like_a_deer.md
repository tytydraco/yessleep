I've been doing some insomnia cleaning around my house here recently, and while doing so, I've stumbled across some old photos of my father and me from some of the many hunting trips we've been on over the years.

But this one photo, in particular, was special. It showed me, with a camouflaged, smudged face and a broad smile, next to my tired-eyed father, who tried to hide a wiry smile. This was our last hunt together.

Hunting was a way for him to decompress after coming back from over there, from those places far away that he was sent off to for months on end with the men who he'd called his brothers, the men who were his second family.

During those months he was gone, my mother and I worried like crazy while waiting until we received his handwritten letters or static-filled phone calls on occasion telling us he was fine, that he loved us, and that he'd be home soon.

It was tough for my mom, especially since I wasn't the most collected kid when it was time to be supportive, and it wasn't until I finally hit my teens that things started to go downhill. I snuck out, stole, fought, and found myself in more trouble than most at that age, but I always managed to snake my way out of it, well, almost...

I was sixteen when he took me on my first real "hunt".

Sure, I've pulled the trigger on dove, geese, and even hogs down in Texas, but my father wanted to be with me for this buck, not just any. It was a ten-point he'd been tracking and keeping tabs on since I was in diapers, and he wanted to be there with me when I bagged it.

"Hey, get some sleep, it's gonna be an early start tomorrow." My father's large frame stopped in my room's doorway while I "studied" for a math test scheduled for the following Monday.

"Will I actually get to shoot this one? You, Uncle Lane, hell, even Mom has bagged one over there." I asked with a huff, concealing my phone that I'd been texting on with a quick hand.

"Hey, language and we'll see..." He chuckled and continued down the hall before stopping abruptly and turning back around, poking his head back through the jarred door.

The look in his crystal blue eyes said it all. *Put it up, or I will.* Meaning I'd more than likely never get it back if he took it.

Hours passed before a loud thud startled me awake out of deep sleep. I waited a few minutes under my blankets before getting up and tiptoeing to the bedroom door, placing my ear to it.

"Nathan, if they found out what you're doing..." My mother spoke with a hiss.

 "You're going to wake Cassidy!" he hissed back, then stopped, undoubtedly listening for me.

"Shelby," He finally spoke after a long moment of silence, "What... What happened to Clemson's little girl is unforgivable, and the sheriff can't do a damn thing about it. I can't walk away from this knowing that what they did is going to go unpunished, you...."

My weight shifted, causing the old wooden floorboards to creak, cutting my father off mid-sentence, "How am I going to explain to Cassidy why you're being dragged away in cuffs, Nathan?" My mother growled as his heavy footsteps grew closer and closer to the door, "Shelb..."

I rushed back into my bed and threw the blankets back over me just as the door opened. My father's immense shadow instantly darkened the yellow light from the hall as I held my breath.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, he shut the door, and I drifted off into a dreamless sleep while they continued to have their hushed argument.

"It's time to go." A harsh whisper startled me awake once more as I swung my feet off the bed and onto the hardwood floor while wiping the sleep from my eyes. It wasn't until the moonlight from outside broke through the clouds that I noticed something was wrong with my father.

His stubbled face and clothes were dirty; his shaggy brown hair, which he usually squared away, was matted down with sweat and dirt.

It looked like he had just gotten the shit kicked out of him as he slipped a beanie over his head, covering what looked like a massive cut at his hairline, as he looked around the room before quietly stepping out into the hall.

Several questions raced through my mind, but the tiredness and the thought of getting that buck chased them off as I slowly got around the darkened room.

After shuffling into warmer clothes and a pair of camouflaged coveralls along with some Muckboots, I was glued to my father's side as we walked to the gun cabinet in his office, "Dad..." I asked aloud only to get a stern look in response.

"Keep your voice down, I don't want to wake your mother. She'd kill me if she knew I was taking you with me." He whispered, grabbing his wood-finished bolt-action hunting rifle, along with a box of ammo and a pair of binoculars, before turning to me. "Here," he handed me the binoculars, then locked the cabinet and headed to the front door.

The air was freezing on that December morning. I remember the cold biting at my exposed eyes and nose as we drove off towards his favorite hunting spot. It was a secluded, untouched patch of land out in the Virginian wilderness that only a few people knew about, other than us.

In the distance, the lights from the old gas station we visited from time to time shone like a beacon as the old truck bounced over the paved road that wound through the hillside like a coiled-up snake.

"Do you want to grab something warm before we head out?" He asked, reading my mind as a gray sedan pulled away from one of the pumps.

"Yes!" I drummed a little victory beat on the dashboard as he pulled the old truck up to the now-empty spot where the sedan had been and killed the engine. "Alright then, let's see what they got." He pocketed his keys as I slid out of the passenger seat and rushed to his side.

"Mornin' Nathan, y'all goin' hunting?" Mr.Baker, the kind old man who owned the station, looked at me and smiled while leaning against the counter, "Yeah, taking little Annie Oakley here on her first real hunt." My father replied as I started my search for a "free" candy bar.

After prowling the aisles and keeping an eye on my father and Mr.Baker like a hawk, I finally got my moment and snatched up a chocolate bar, sliding it into my coat pocket as my father set down a steaming cup of coffee and a cup of hot chocolate on the countertop.

"That'll be," Mr.Baker looked at my father with a *Deal with it, or I will* look, "Five even."

*Shit...*

"Have a good day, Mr.Baker, and take care." My father gave him a nod and looked down at me, "And *you*... Can put that candy bar back."

"What are you talking about?" I lied through my teeth as a fire grew in his eyes, "Cassidy..." His hands tensed around the foam cups.

"Sir." Mr.Baker spoke up before my father glared at him, causing the kind older man to clam up instantly.

I quickly placed the candy bar back and followed my father to the truck, my head hung low in silence, thinking of a way to salvage the situation, only to come up empty-handed.

"Do you think I'm blind and stupid? Why would you do such a thing, Cass?" He asked with spite in his voice as the truck pulled back onto the road.

"No, sir, I just... I..." I stammered before he slammed an open palm onto the steering column, causing me to jump, "I thought I raised you better!" His eyes shot daggers over in my direction, then back up to the road.

I finally worked up the nerve to speak after a few minutes, "I'm sorry..." My father just let out a sigh before clearing his throat.

"I know I've been gone, and I'm sorry, Cass, I really am, but you need to understand that when I'm gone, you're the one who has to help your mother. The house and chores, schooling are all on you..." A deer ran into the road a split second after we turned a bend, and at the last second, it jumped, narrowly missing the bumper.

My heart was slamming against my chest like a drum, but my father wasn't fazed as he followed the winding road with ease, "It's time for you to grow up, Cass. " His phone rang once before he looked at it and answered, "Will, what's up, brother?" He asked, with a blank expression, as if nothing had just happened.

He was good at that, putting on a mask and hiding his emotions; it was something I got really good at that day.

"It's done." Came the response from Will, one of the guys who served with him.

"Thanks. I owe you, brother. Cass is with me, we'll have to sit down and talk once this is over." With a click, the line went dead, and the joy and happiness seemed to fade away as he tossed the phone onto the dashboard as we rounded another bend.

"It's not too late. You can drop her off at Ali's, and we can finish this. You don't need to get her involved." Will seemed pensive.

"We will meet you at the Cabi,n" Was my father's last response before hanging up.

"What was that all about?" I asked, eyeing my father's phone, but got no response.  *What the hell is going on?*

The drive continued for another fifteen minutes in silence before we finally pulled off onto a little secluded dirt road that could've easily been missed if you didn't look for it. "Grab the binoculars and get ready." He spoke calmly now as he scanned the road ahead of us.

"Do you think we'll find the buck?" I asked, trying to get a response while clutching onto the bulky binoculars, slinging the loop over my head as the truck pulled over.

I got the cold shoulder in response as he exited the truck and melted into the tree line like a specter, leaving me alone in the darkness. After a few panicked seconds of traversing through the tangled dark underbrush and resisting the urge to call out "Dad?" like a scared, lost little girl, my foot connected with his boot, almost causing me to fall on my face.

He was crouched down with the rifle at his side, next to a patch of matted-down grass. "Come here..." He whispered, quickly holding out his large hand, grabbing mine, and guiding it down onto the patch of grass. Its cozy warmth granted me a few moments of joy from the freezing air as he looked at me.

"They were here not too long ago," He spoke with a barely audible whisper before pointing to some disturbed foliage to our front, "Looks like they went that way, let's see if we can find them, maybe we'll spot our buck."

My legs began to ache after what felt like hours of stalking through the woods without making any sound until my father finally held up a hand before slowly getting low to the ground.

He raised his hand and pointed through the trees that opened up into a small clearing ahead of us before raising the rifle, resting his cheek on the stock, and taking aim through the scope. I cursed myself for not bringing any gloves, as the cold stung my bare hands as I raised the bulky binoculars to my eyes. There was a large doe accompanied by three fawns at her side that were chewing on roots, as white plumes of steam wafted up into the air as they breathed. The buck we were looking for appeared from the south, joining the group with a trot.

It was a surreal moment, and I was caught in its bliss and beauty until something rustled in the trees across from us, sending the deer scattering and the birds flying off in all directions.

Two figures came crashing through the woodline and out into the opening, the steam from their bodies radiated around them, making them look like ghosts as I tried to comprehend what the hell just happened.

My father just held a finger to his lips in response, grabbed the binoculars, then handed the rifle to me. "Get ready." He mouthed before bringing the binoculars up to his eyes. I was confused for a second, then it finally hit me.

He wanted me to aim at them, to break one of the most important rules he'd instilled in me with an iron fist. In that instant, this man was no longer my father; he was a stranger. A stranger in my father's body. This man was a monster.

I hesitated as I shouldered the massive rifle and took aim with unsteady hands. The moon was behind us, so we were in the trees' shadows, making us nearly invisible to anyone looking at us from the front.

"Oh god... Oh, Jesus." One of the figures spoke aloud while breathing heavily, "He's still out there somewhere. We have to keep moving, James." One hissed in response as I exhaled slowly, steadying my aim.

I could see both of them clearly through the scope. The one on the left was facing the direction they'd come from. He was wearing a dirty red jogging jacket, torn, stained jeans, and what looked like earrings.

*Definitely not from around here,* I thought before switching over to the other one.

The one on the right had something wet running down his right cheek, glistening in the ambient light. His shaggy black hair bobbed as he looked around frantically before looking right at me, but he showed no indication of spotting us.

"Did you see what happened to Chad? That fucking monster skinned him! Lucas! We have to find the fucking road, and we have to get the fuck out of here." The one on the right hissed as branches snapped off to my right, causing the two men to crouch low.

"What the fuck was that?" The one on the left, *Lucas, I think*, called out as I felt a large hand on my shoulder.

The one on the right, James, stood back up with his back facing me.

 *Just like a deer... Just like a deer...* 

I hovered the crosshair under his left shoulder blade and placed a trembling finger on the trigger. 

*Just like a deer.*..

My father's large calloused hand suddenly wrapped around mine as his finger pulled mine against the trigger. The shot that followed surprised me as the rifle stock slammed into my shoulder, causing me to wince as dead leaves and dirt kicked up in front of me.

I managed to see James pitch forward and fall face-first into the long grass beside Lucas before I pulled back the bolt, ejecting the brass casing before slamming the bolt back home with a crisp snap. Lucas cried out in horror in response and took off back to where they had emerged.

"Good shot, I'm proud of you, Cassidy, real proud." The stranger whispered in my ear and squeezed my shoulder.

I trudged through the grass that was knee-high to me while the hulking monster moved with ease at a quick pace before kneeling next to the man *I shot... I just shot another human being... I just killed someone...*

A look of confusion was plastered on the man's pale face as I got closer, wet bubbles of blood rose from his mouth with a labored hissing noise, and a hole the size of my fist was where the man's pectoral muscle and heart used to be.

"Right through the heart," The stranger's words snapped me back to reality as he looked towards where Lucas had fled off to, "That was a clean shot, think you can do it again?"

"I... I.. Yes." I struggled to speak as he stood back up, "Good, you're going to track the next one down then. Show me that you've been paying attention to our lessons, Annie Oakley." He quipped as I took the lead.

The sky began to turn pale gray as I followed the disturbed brush and broken branches as we penetrated the treeline. It wasn't hard to follow where Lucas had gone. In his panicked state, he left behind a noticeable trail that even a novice hunter could track, leading off to the west. There was a creek a mile down from where we were headed, and not too far from that was the valley.

*He'd probably cross or drink at the river before moving on towards the valley in an attempt to cover more ground and hide... Just like a deer...*

I followed the winding trail until the faint sound of running water began to creep towards us as the sky brightened to a blood orange. And just as I predicted, the outline of Lucas was on the other side of the river.

His shoulders hitched up and down as he sobbed; his faint cries echoed through the woods, causing the hair on my neck to stand up as I stopped in my tracks.

*Inhale slowly and exhale through your nose.* My father's voice echoed in my head, bringing back memories of when he first taught me to shoot.

I rested my cheek on the stock and hovered the crosshairs of the scope over the crying man's chest, slipping my finger onto the cold metal trigger. I hesitated, but only for a moment, as the fear of what the monster would do to me if I didn't shoot began to worm around inside my mind.

The rifle boomed, shattering the silence just as Lucas sidestepped, causing the round to slam into his shoulder, spinning him like a top and sending him to the ground.

The hulking monster beside me let out an audible curse and bolted towards the wounded man, who was now wailing loudly while crawling his way into the tall brush in a pitiful attempt to escape.

"Why? Why are you doing this?" Lucas croaked as the monster dragged him back towards the riverbank by his legs.

I could see the tears in Lucas' eyes. I slowly approached them, "You know why! What you and your friends did to that little girl..." Spittle flew from the monster's mouth as it screamed through clenched teeth just inches away from Lucas's face. "She was thirteen! Thirteen years old! You sick fucks."

"She asked us to do it. I promise you'll never see me again. Please, I have money, my parents can pay you..." Lucas pleaded with fear in his eyes before being punched in the nose, with a sickening wet *Crunch* as blood spewed onto his shirt.

The hunting rifle suddenly felt heavy in my hands like someone had weighed it down with sand and lead as the punches continued to land with wet thuds until I couldn't hold it back anymore and finally began to sob hysterically. 

Lucas coughed and spat out teeth and blood through labored breaths, but the monster didn't take his eyes off of Lucas, who was now staring at me with one good eye. "Why?" Lucas croaked. His face was a bruised and swollen mess beyond recognition now as he lay there limp like prey that had given up and was ready to be slaughtered by wolves.

My shaking hand found its way to the rifle's bolt as I walked up to the two men at the riverbank. I pulled the bolt back, ejecting the empty brass casing, then slid it forward, chambering a live round.

*Just like a deer. Just like a deer.*
