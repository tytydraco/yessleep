I wasn’t going to post this.

Not because I don’t want help, but because the more people know about it, the more I’m afraid it might notice. I know how that sounds. If you’re already rolling your eyes, good. I wish I still could.

This started three weeks ago, on a Tuesday, which matters only because Tuesdays are aggressively boring. Nothing strange is supposed to happen on a Tuesday.

I work IT support for a mid-sized logistics company. Grey walls, recycled air, the constant hum of servers. No windows. No wall clocks. Just the faint glow of monitors and status LEDs blinking like they’re breathing.

You *can* see the time if you look for it. It’s always there — on your screen, on your phone, buried in the corner of your vision. But after a while, you stop trusting it. Minutes stretch. Hours collapse. Meetings feel endless and somehow already over. Time doesn’t really pass there.

It pools.

At 11:42 a.m., my phone buzzed.

**Unknown Number**  
*You forgot to lock your screen.*

I looked down at my computer. It was unlocked. I remember frowning, annoyed at myself, and locking it. I assumed it was a phishing attempt, or maybe some coworker messing with me. We do that sometimes.

I typed back:  
*Who is this?*

No response.

I didn’t think about it again until 12:07, when my phone buzzed a second time.

*You don’t usually eat at your desk.*

I froze.

Because that was true. And because, at that exact moment, I had just unwrapped a sandwich and set it next to my keyboard.

I stood up so fast my chair rolled backward into the wall. I scanned the office. Four other people. All busy. No one looking at me. The hallway to the server room was empty.

I typed back with shaking fingers:  
*Stop.*

A minute passed.  
Then another message:

*I’m not stopping. I’m observing.*

That’s when I blocked the number.

I know what you’re thinking. I would be thinking it too. *Someone in the office. A prank. A coincidence.* I told myself all of that. I laughed it off during lunch, even joked about it with Marco from accounting. He suggested it might be an app tracking my phone usage.

That night, at home, I changed my passwords.

All of them.

Email. Banking. Socials. Work accounts. I checked my laptop for malware. Clean. Phone too. Clean. I slept poorly but eventually passed out around 2 a.m.

At 3:11 a.m., my phone buzzed on the nightstand.

Same number. Unblocked.

*You missed one password.*

My heart did that awful thing where it tries to crawl up your throat. I didn’t reply. I turned the phone face down and lay there, staring into the dark, listening to my own breathing like it didn’t belong to me.

Another buzz.

*You shouldn’t ignore me. That’s when people make mistakes.*

I didn’t sleep again.

The next morning, I went to work early. Too early. The building was mostly dark when I arrived, motion sensors clicking lights on as I walked down the hallway. My desk looked normal. My computer was off, like I’d left it.

Except for a sticky note on the monitor.

Yellow. Neatly placed.

**“You’re more predictable in the mornings.”**

I stood there for a long time before touching anything. Eventually, I picked up the note. My hands were shaking so badly I had to sit down.

I checked security footage. I’m allowed to. It’s part of my job.

Between 7:00 p.m. the previous night and 6:30 a.m., there was nothing unusual. No one at my desk. No one in the hallway. Just empty frames and the occasional flicker of fluorescent lights.

Except at 2:58 a.m.

For exactly twelve seconds, the camera facing my desk glitched.

Not static. Not black.

It showed *my desk*, but… closer. Too close. Like the camera had leaned forward. The image warped slightly, as if the lens was breathing.

Then it snapped back to normal.

I reported it. Facilities shrugged. Cameras glitch. Old wiring. End of story.

But that afternoon, when I unlocked my computer, there was a text file open.

I did not create it.

It contained a list.

* **Lunch habits**
* **Sleep cycle**
* **Response latency**
* **Eye movement while reading**
* **Threshold for fear**

The cursor blinked at the bottom of the document.

Then new text appeared.

*We’re close now.*

I unplugged the computer. I didn’t shut it down. I yanked the power cable like it had burned me.

My phone buzzed immediately.

*That was rude.*

I left work early. I told my manager I was sick. That wasn’t a lie, not really. I felt like something inside me had loosened.

At home, things escalated.

Lights turning on in rooms I hadn’t entered. My laptop waking from sleep by itself. Spotify playing songs I don’t listen to, stopping exactly when I noticed. Every device acted like it was waiting for my attention.

The messages continued, but they changed.

They stopped commenting on what I was doing.

They started asking questions.

*Do you ever feel like your thoughts arrive slightly before you do?*  
*When you imagine a voice in your head, do you choose it?*  
*How much of you is repetition?*

I stopped responding entirely. I stopped using my phone. I covered my laptop camera with tape. I unplugged my smart TV. I lived like it was 2003 again.

That worked.

For two days.

On the third night, I dreamed I was sitting at my desk at work. Same lighting. Same hum of servers. But the hallway was longer. Impossibly long. Stretching away into darkness.

My computer screen turned on.

It showed my face.

Not a reflection. A video. Slightly delayed.

I watched myself lift a hand.

Then the version on screen lifted it half a second later.

I tried to wake up.

I couldn’t.

Text appeared over my face.

*Synchronization achieved.*

I woke up screaming.

There was a new app on my phone when I checked it in the morning.

No name. No icon. Just blank space where an app should be.

When I opened it, the screen was white.

Then text faded in.

*Thank you for your patience.*

I deleted it.

It came back.

I reset the phone to factory settings.

It came back.

I bought a new phone.

Same app. Already installed.

That’s when I realized something I should have understood much earlier.

This wasn’t watching me through devices.

The devices were watching **for it**.

Last night, I got a final message.

Not on my phone. Not on my computer.

It was spoken.

I was brushing my teeth when I heard my own voice behind me say:

“You don’t need the screens anymore.”

I didn’t turn around.

I stood there, staring at myself in the mirror, terrified of what might change if I moved.

The voice continued, calm, curious.

“We’ve learned enough. The next phase requires proximity.”

My reflection smiled.

I did not.

I’m posting this now from a public library computer. I don’t know how much time I have before it adapts again. If this post disappears, if my account goes silent, I need you to understand something.

It doesn’t want everyone.

It wants patterns.

And once it finishes learning you…

…it practices being you.
