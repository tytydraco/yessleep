I've had a secret since I was seven.

It started about a week after the funeral. I met more adults that day than I ever had. "I held you when you were a baby" and all that annoying shit. I thought one of those nameless Aunts and Uncles were behind it when I found the first bag at the edge of my driveway.

*A treat to get you through, from your special friend to you, today when you're feeling blue!*

Inside the polka dot gift bag was that note, in pen, with a Fudgerific bar (regional Michigan candy bar, locals may remember). Stranger-danger messaging must've gone right over my head because I was choking it down before I finished reading the note. I remember crinkle paper spilling out the top, my favorite shade of purple too.

Fudgerific bars were me and Dad's favorite. We'd grab four from 7/Eleven after my tee-ball games and eat them on the way home. It had to be our little secret, my health-conscious Mom would've had his head.

I hadn't much felt a taste for them at that time, but eating it that day brought me some much-needed comfort. Made me more at peace with those old memories.

I checked up and down my street for the gifter, but they seemed to be long gone. With that I brought the bag back to my room and stuffed it deep under my bed.

I guess something about being that young, faced with something so oddly whimsical, made it instinct just to keep it my casual secret.

Or maybe I was just a dumb kid who was easily wooed by chocolate.

Either way, I know the first bag was almost completely out of my mind when I discovered the second.

It was a stressful household on a good day, and Dad being gone had just exacerbated Mom's temper. I can't blame her for snapping on me, but the turbulence of that time sent me into a full on meltdown like I hadn't felt before. Crying until the sheets looked like I peed them. Wrapped in a blanket cocoon.

That was my state when the second bag appeared at the end of my bed.

My door had been locked. I knew I jumped up onto the bed from there. Yet somehow in the time I had been crying the bag was left there, silently no less.

Another note, more crinkle paper in my favorite purple, and of course another Fudgerific bar. Chewing that chocolately candy finally put a quiet to my sobbing.

I see now it reads kinda unnerving in words like this, but at the time it all felt like a warm hug. Some special pat on the back from the great beyond.

I remember around this time family members would express worry about me. *Is Nina okay?/Has she processed any of this?/Maybe she should talk to someone*.

But I didn't understand any of that. I didn't have to *process* anything. It was just like all those people had said to me at the funeral: *He'll always be with you*. I intuitively understood that this was a bit more literal, but I just counted myself lucky and accepted the gifts.

Their frequency over the next few years varied greatly.

They seemed to come at the moments I really needed them, or at least at the moments my gifter thought I might. I could go a few months without receiving them at times. Then one bad day, or a fight with my Mom, and I might find four in a single week.

He was always especially sensitive to Mom issues. I guess it makes sense.

Their locations...varied too. Sometimes as simple as a bag left in my room, but other times absurdly exact and seemingly psychic like the freaking bathroom stall at school. I dropped MANY a deuce at school while eating a Fudgerific bar.

Which, makes this a good time to mention, Fudgerific bars left shelves YEARS ago. The small parent company folded. Yet in every bag, every time, was a factory fresh bar.

It kept the past intact for me...*fresh* I guess you could say.

And in every single one of these gift bags was a new rhyming sentence, always corny and always heartfelt.

Until June 2nd of this year. My seventeenth year.

I met my first boyfriend Trevor in homeroom. He was shy, so I had to take the initiative and finally ask him out after months of awkward eye contact. Things were going smooth, especially since his likewise meek rescue dog Duke was obsessed with me. That's when I found a new bag on my driver's seat after school.

But something intuitively felt *off* to me.

Years of stresses followed by gifts had established a sort of understood pattern between my feelings and their appearances.

Yet for the past two weeks I had felt *better* than I ever had before.

Inside this bag there was no crinkle paper, nor a Fudgerific bar. Just one message.

*STOP IT*

For the first time I felt conscious that something had left this bag here. My car door was left slightly ajar, and my fabric seat had torn with what looked like nail marks.

What was he trying to do?

I tried to put it out of my mind, chalking it up to some sort of fluke as I tossed it in the nearest school trash can.

The next morning Trevor wasn't in homeroom.

No, before you start wondering, he didn't disappear or get murdered. He moved homerooms. Requested a transfer as I came to find out.

I caught him in the hallway and tried to talk but he hurried past me. Not only ignoring me but actively fleeing my presence. Texts sent later went unanswered. Every call left ringing until he finally just outright blocked my number.

But I don't take no for an answer that easily, especially with the dread starting to fill a pit in my stomach. I had to know what did this.

His Mom adored me, but even she was a standoffish when she answered the door. It took her almost five minutes to wrangle Trevor down. 

The way he went tearing into me made me miss when he was silent. "Who is he?/Why'd you get me in the middle of this?/Leave me the fuck alone!" Trevor seemed convinced I had a secret boyfriend. Not realizing what he meant I yelled right back at him, grossly offended by the assumption. 

Then he told me about the bag he found Duke in. 

His dog had been covered by crinkle paper. It was only when he pulled it off that he found the body...and the note. 

*STAY AWAY*

I don't think I got another word out after that. I just hurried back home, but not before checking my backseat. On the drive back I eagle-eyed every corner. Every dense forest. 

I couldn't see him, but I felt eyes from *somewhere*. 

The second I got home I secured every opening. Every window latch and side door locked tight. It wasn't much, but it eased my mind some. Sure enough, I found a new gift bag left earlier on my bed, Fudgerific bar and all.

*Better this way, together we can stay, no others to lead you astray*

Suffice to say I wasn't in the mood for candy. I felt weird about being alone too, so for the first time in what must've been years I sat down on the couch with my Mom. 

She was through a few too many hard kombuchas. I guess that was her idea of a healthier beer alternative. After about thirty minutes of silently letting NCIS play on I got the nerve to ask her about Dad.

Something about her blood alcohol content, or maybe a complete lack of caring about how it would affect me, led her to spill everything I hadn't known.

His suicide wasn't the tragic end of a tortured soul.

Mom had discovered things about him. Things he had done to others.

Things he had planned to do to me. 

I wanted to tell her everything about what was happening, that he wasn't *entirely* out of the picture, but she was too far gone. My words just bounced right off her inebriated ears. 

I anxiously tried to keep her awake as best I could, hell I was shaking her by the end, but she passed out for good an hour ago. 

It was while I was re-checking the windows and doors that I noticed another gift bag on the porch outside. 

Then another. 

And another. 

Now there are at least a dozen gift bags waiting out there. 

And I just heard something clatter on the wood of the porch...
