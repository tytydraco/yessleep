This started a few months ago, but the ending… happened last night. I’m still shaking as I type this. I don’t know if anyone will believe me. Maybe I don’t care. Maybe I just want someone to know.

It started when I met her.

Her name was Mia. Quiet girl. Transfer student. Pale skin, long black hair, big dark eyes that always looked just a little too wide, like she didn’t blink enough. She sat next to me in English, and one day after class, she asked if I liked horror books.

I said yeah. That was our first conversation.

She started following me around after that. Always just there when I turned around. Always smiling. I didn’t mind at first. I thought maybe she was just lonely or awkward. She was nice. Too nice, honestly. Always remembered tiny things I said. Laughed too hard at my jokes. Looked at me the whole time, never the group.

Then my friend Marcus went missing.

We’d hung out just two nights before—played Call of Duty at his house. Next morning, he was just gone. His parents filed a report. The whole school was buzzing. But Mia… she didn’t react. Just asked me if I wanted to “hang out more now that Marcus wasn’t around to distract me.”

I laughed awkwardly. She didn’t.

Then there was Lily. My childhood friend. She invited me to the arcade Friday night. I went. She didn’t show up. Next morning? Missing.

Gone. Like Marcus.

That’s when I noticed something that made my blood go cold.

Mia… started wearing the same hair clips Lily used to wear. Not similar. The same. Green star-shaped ones. She’d never worn them before. I asked her where she got them, and she just smiled and said, “Guess we have the same taste.”

She also started using words Marcus used. Slang he made up. She even mimicked his walk. When I pointed it out, she just giggled and said, “I learn fast. I like being close to people.”

People kept disappearing. Two more friends. And each time, Mia got… weirder. Closer. More like them. Like she was collecting their pieces and stitching them onto herself.

I stopped replying to her messages. I started going straight home. I was terrified to even look at her. But somehow, she always knew where I was. Always knew what I was doing.

Then last night happened.

I was in bed. Half-asleep. Feverish. I’d been feeling sick all day. Something in my gut just said, Don’t fall asleep. Keep the light on.

But I must’ve dozed off. Because I woke up to the sound of breathing. Not mine.

I opened my eyes.

She was there. Mia.

Standing inches from my bed.

But it wasn’t just Mia. Her face was—wrong. Like all the faces of my friends had been melted together and stretched into something inhuman. Her skin bubbled and twitched like it was trying to settle on one shape but couldn’t decide. I saw Marcus’s smile, Lily’s eyes, someone else’s nose… it was like a slideshow of the dead flickering in front of me.

She leaned down. I couldn’t move.

Then, right next to my ear, she whispered: 

“Why are you terrified you’re mine now aren't you happy?”

I screamed. My mom came running. The room was empty.

She thinks I had a fever dream. Maybe I did. But the window was open. And on my desk, where I swear I left my headphones, was a green star-shaped hair clip.
