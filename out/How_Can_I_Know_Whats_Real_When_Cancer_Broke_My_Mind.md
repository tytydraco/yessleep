I was back there, convulsing on an operating table. Masked faces looked down on me, silhouetted against electric lights, like rogue moons eclipsing a faraway sun. The theatre air was bleached and sterile, the illumination piercing. Surgeons need to be able to see what they’re doing, I suppose. Enigmatic, eccentric mutilators who I love to hate. I have no doubt it was one of them, looming over my open skull behind me, who gave a whispered signal to the anaesthetist. 

“Sedate him.”

The nurses buzzed all around me, working to the lunatic beeping of medical machines. The edges of my vision blackened. The best way I can describe the journey to unconsciousness while having a seizure, is a slow, circular narrowing of vision, and a gradual, yet total, sensory loss. Just like in the cartoons or movies. It’s a small death.

I sat bolt upright in bed, breathless and sweat-drenched. The covers were soaked. I pinched myself hard and felt pain. The dream was over. I heaved myself out of bed and went to the bathroom to splash my face. It was a memory, nothing more. I braced myself on the edge of the sink, tap running, and looked in the mirror. Water dripped off my nose and my grey eyes were bloodshot. Tentative, I lifted a hand to the top of my head. A deep, four-inch scar ran in a ‘c’ shape, just left of centre and hidden by wispy, radiotherapy-damaged hair. 

My partner, Claire, is adamant that I’m still as handsome as ever, but I don’t see it. I switched off the bathroom light and stumbled through darkness to my bedside, where I flicked on the lamp. There was a framed picture of Claire and I at my air force induction ceremony. In that world, I’m six-foot-four, uniformed, tanned, with sandy hair, and bolt-upright. She’s petite, with skin like porcelain, and auburn hair touching her pronounced collarbones. Her green dress matches the backdrop, as she intended. We posed under a willow tree, next to a little stream, beaming smiles at my mom behind the camera.

I tossed the damp sheet and covers onto the floor, and lay on the bare mattress, staring at the ceiling. I didn’t need to look at the picture to see him because he lived in my mind’s eye. The airman in the picture, fresh out of his basic training. That proud, confident man I’d been. My self-belief had taken a beating, absolutely, but I hadn’t lost it completely. Not quite. What I *had* lost fully was my innocence. I ached for it. Being oblivious of what was yet to come. 

I killed the lights and sleep returned. Swimming through fog, I found myself standing on undulating ground. I was dressed in full plate armour and held a wide-bladed sword that glinted in the moonlight. A field was before me, where a legion of skeletal dead men stood, and a dark forest lay beyond. High on a throne at the back of their ranks was Claire. I tightened my grip on the sword’s handle and strode forward. Gathering pace now, I lowered the tip to point it at the skeleton army. A clear signal of intent. I smashed into them, swinging my weapon in wide arcs to cleave five or six of them at a time. Loose bones and rotten flesh clattered around me as I punched a hole through their lines, always moving towards Claire. The night air in this dream world was cold in my nostrils.

As I got closer, Claire descended from the throne and ran for the treeline. I burst from the rear of the dead men’s formation, in pursuit.

“Claire! Wait!”

I paused, confused. Throne. She was their leader, making me her enemy. That made no sense. She cast a fearful glance over her shoulder and disappeared beneath the dark eaves of the forest. The dead men had crept up on me while I stood, and when they pounced I could only manage a half stroke. Cold, bony hands took hold of my ankles and wrists. They clawed incessantly, pulling me down and pinning me on my back. Suffocating me.

“Claire! Make them stop! Please!”

I sat bolt upright in bed, breathless and sweat-drenched. The covers were soaked. I pinched myself hard and felt pain. The dream was over. I heaved myself out of bed and saw a shape in the gloom, over by my desk. I turned on the lamp and jumped at the sight of a man reclining in my office chair. He was slim and lithe-looking, with long fingers steepled at his throat. He wore a simple outfit: grey jogging bottoms and a black hoodie. The hood was up so that his twinkling eyes were half in shadow. His nose was hooked, his chin sharp, and his smile baleful. I stood there, naked in the half light, once again pinching my forearm fiercely, and trying to deny the pain I felt.

“Your face was a picture when she left you on the battlefield, bud. Not quite the knight in shining armour.” 

“I’m still dreaming.”

He spread his palms. “You pinched, right? And it hurt?”

I had, and it had.

“Who are you? Why are you in my house?"

“I’m the sower of seeds, man. A real handful, if you’ll excuse the double entendre, but you asked. Now, that dream of yours… what do you think? Scary?”

“No.”

He suddenly sat forward, elbows on knees, and I saw grey hair, and a forehead riven with deep lines.

“It’s not opposite day, bud! Think of the symbolism. Indulge me. You fought death to get to your sweetheart, yet when you did, she turned tail. Makes me wonder whether you *fought* it, or *brought* it? She certainly *saw* it, and dashed off somewhere you couldn’t follow. Meanwhile, what happened to you?”

“They got me. I died.”

“Now we’re cooking! You’re playing along, good man! You fought bravely, but you fell. Would you want that for her? To suffer that fate?”

“No, not at all.”

“Well, it’s a good job she ran then, isn’t it? I see you here tossing and turning and wailing her name, like a baby crying out for mommy. Interpret the dream, man. Think. You can’t go bringing down death on your sweetheart like a damned meteor shower. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. But not for her. Not yet, at least.”

Beneath the hood, I saw the intruder’s eyes smoulder with humour. I crept closer as he rambled on.

“Speaking of dust. Do you see fear in this here handful of… dirt?”

He rotated his palm to let it face the ceiling. Sitting on it was a little pyramid of soot. He closed his hand into a fist and let it pour out onto my desk.

“It’s just dirt.” I said, getting closer.

He seemed taken aback. “It's death. Don't you fear death? You should. Unless you’re still under the impression that it’s opposite day. Didn’t find that funny before, and I still don’t, FYI. Let me take you back a couple of hours. The dream of the operating table when they tried to remove the cancer from your brain- such a terrible shame that it’s inoperable. When they pulled and tugged too hard on that little cluster of chaos in your brain, and you had a convulsion, what did it feel like?”

“It felt like I was dying.” I said.

“And were you scared?”

“Yes.”

“At last, the truth of it. As seen as you’ve been so honest, I’ll make a confession of my own: I put it there. A seed sown by these fair hands.”

He once again held up his hands, like a despot addressing crowds from a palace balcony. I was rounding the edge of my bed now, he was cornered.

“The doctors said there was nothing I could’ve done to prevent it. A guy in a hoodie doesn’t go around clicking his fingers and shooting cancer lightning bolts at people. It doesn’t make any sense.” I said.

“Cancer doesn’t make any sense. I don’t make any sense. This whole situation doesn’t make any sense, bud, but here we are. Give yourself another pinch, why don’t you?”

I lunged for him, but my fingers found no purchase. He was thin air. I crashed into my chair and slumped into unconsciousness, distant laughter ringing in my ears.

Rays of light bathed my face as I came to my senses. I uncoiled myself from where I’d crashed into the office chair and staggered to my feet, still drunk on the potent cocktail of sleep and dream fragments. I blinked to clear my vision, and looked at a bedroom in disarray. Everything could be explained, apart from a small pile of soot on my desk.
