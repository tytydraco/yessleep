I saw it once when I was in middle school.

It was a thick book, like a dictionary or an encyclopedia, and all it contained were endless pages of people's faces—what they looked like before and after death.
On the right page was a photo of the person's face while they were alive, and on the left, a photo of their face after death...

I don't know who made such a book, for what purpose, or how.
But it’s said to be a secret reference material among people involved in fortune-telling.
And according to them, if you look through that book every day, you'll eventually become able to recognize the Death Signs that appear on a person’s face before they die.

The person who showed me that book was a teacher at the test prep course I was attending at the time. That was over twenty years ago.
He was working part-time at a cram school for a few years after graduating from college.
Then one day, he said, "I'm going to Bali to study white magic," and after that, no one ever heard from him again.

This is a story I heard from that teacher.
Let's call him Brian.

When Brian was a college student, he got his hands on that Book of Death Signs and spent every day staring at it.
He barely attended classes and was deeply immersed in the occult, but he liked mountain climbing and would sometimes show up to the university’s hiking club.

One day, he was supposed to go on a winter mountain trip and met up with the group at a small station near the Catskill Mountains.

When he looked at the faces of the group members who had gathered, Brian realized for the first time that Death Signs really do exist.

Naturally, Brian refused to climb the mountain and desperately tried to stop them, shouting,
"All of your faces have Death Signs!"

But they just laughed and said,
"Huh? What are you talking about? Do you think you're some kind of psychic?"

They left Brian behind, and the other four headed off into the mountains.

A few days later, while watching TV at home, Brian saw a news report that members of the university’s hiking club had gone missing.
To his shock, Brian’s name was listed among those missing.

Shocked, he immediately contacted the university and got in touch with other hiking club alumni who had gone climbing with the group.
Then they rushed to Woodstock, the town they usually used as a base for mountain trips.

Due to bad weather, the search had to be postponed until the next day.
With nothing else to do, Brian headed to a familiar café they always visited after coming down from the mountains.

There, he saw the supposedly missing members casually chatting at a table as if nothing had happened.

Brian, surprised, ran over and sat with them, happily saying,
"You guys made it out alive!"

Then one of them, holding a newspaper, placed it on the table and said quietly,
"You... you’ve got a Death Sign."
"That thing you talked about… the Death Signs, right?"

He stared at Brian and gave him a creepy smile.

Chilled to the bone, Brian ran into the restroom in the back of the café and looked into the mirror.
But there was nothing there—nothing that looked like a Death Sign.

When he came out, the members who had just been there were nowhere to be seen.

He asked the café owner,
"Where did my friends go?"

But the owner just tilted his head and gave a vague response.
According to the owner—

"You suddenly came in and sat down alone at a table, talking to yourself.
Then you suddenly ran into the restroom…"

Brian, puzzled, looked down at the table and picked up the newspaper that had been left there.

There was an article about the missing hiking club, with five photos of their faces.
At the very bottom was Brian’s photo.

The other four all had clear Death Signs on their faces.
