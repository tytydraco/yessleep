My whole life, I lived like a rat. Shut in by four walls that reflected the blue light of a monitor. With tired eyes that gazed non-stop at lines of code that unlocked the secrets of others.

I feel really awkward writing all this down with a BIC pen in a blue, cram-school notebook instead of with the keyboard of a computer. My hand keeps cramping, and my fingers are smudged with ink. But I don’t dare go near a computer ever again. I won’t tell you where I am, because I tremble at the thought that It might find me somehow… I’m just hoping that someone, at some point, finds this testimony and understands why I did what I did.

Ever since I was small, there was something about me that pushed people away. Teenagers call it “the plague,” wise old folks call it antisocial behaviour. What I remember from my school days is the thinly-veiled pain of rejection that wasn’t quite like a wound, but something else, something foreign. It stemmed from the brain and constricted the heart. A pain that doesn’t go away with just an ordinary painkiller. I had no choice; they’d taken it away from me. So, rejection became my queen and solitude my mistress. And when someone’s a loner in the era when computers obey the “be fruitful and multiply” commandment of their own God, we all know where they will find solace.

Any time I had to attend classes to avoid being kicked out of uni due to poor attendance, I always sat apart from others. I would stare at the silent beige wall until whichever sluggard professor would arrive. It didn’t have much to offer me. Apart from a few spots that needed spackle, it was a rather monotonous wall. It stood there alone. Walls don’t need other walls for company.

The fatiguing glare of the fluorescent lights washed over it and I could see my own dark reflection. Worthy of a single quick glance from those around and nothing more. I found the prospect of becoming like the wall quite attractive, as absurd as it was. What I mean is achieving what it already had and I lacked. Freeing myself from the human need for socialization and interaction.

I might not have given a shit about new happenings in computer science or about my fellow students, uni forced you to participate in a group project in order to graduate. Otherwise, it would be bye-bye to that coveted degree and, by extension, to your value on the outside. And I was running out of money.

The last thing I wanted was to interact with people. At the thought alone, my stomach crumpled like an accordion. You know, when something hurts you, you try to avoid it, it’s how we’re programmed by nature. And if there’s something I know as an IT guy, it’s this: we execute that which we’re programmed to do.

If I failed to graduate, I would have to move back home and I didn’t want to. Back home, I’d have to play hide-and-seek to satisfy my passion for screens and lines of code, something that my parents couldn’t accept. So, my only way out was employment. A paycheck could guarantee my freedom.

The interview for the project started out pretty normal, with questions and answers about my CV and what would make me stand out specifically for this project. I lied, said as convincingly as I could that Artificial Intelligence was my passion. For I knew that AI was this professor’s field of study. I said that the reason I applied to this uni was to build something revolutionary. The professor’s eyebrows raised, his initial hesitation transitioning into cautious identification. He looked at me with a nostalgic gleam in his eyes, as if he was seeing in me the personification of his youth.

“You want to build something revolutionary, huh? Then you chose very wisely. My goal is to bring a whole new dimension to artificial intelligence. A tool that will truly free it. A strength that mankind doesn’t utilize to its full potential… Consciousness.”

But how do you transfer something like that into a computer? As much as you might not know anything about computer science, you can grasp how difficult the matter is just from a philosophical standpoint. Many students came in confidently, with an arrogant reassurance of their own success. Every time one of them declared they were leaving the project; I could barely hold myself back from celebrating like the most fanatic football fan.

Because, while they struggled to handle the basics, I was triumphing, achieving incredible results with my code. The professor would thump me approvingly on the shoulder every time he studied my progress. For the first time in my life I had become the star pupil, the example to follow, unlike during my school years. Just like that, the professor began trusting me with more advanced work while the others became more of a hindrance to him.

Now that I’m shrouded in the safety of distance, there’s another thing I have to confess. There were many of “those people” on the project that were incredibly talented. Perhaps… It hurts me to admit it, but perhaps much more talented than me. Talented enough to outshine me. But they lacked something I possessed; the skills to destroy, breach, and steal data. That first time, I had second thoughts about sabotaging my fellow classmates, thinking *‘What if someone catches me red-handed?’* So, I did nothing.

But when I saw that windbag John bragging with his chest puffed up, I felt both jealous and threatened. If someone deserved praise and recognition in there, that someone was me. Simply put, because I’d worked harder than anyone. It was only fair.

I made them look like clueless little schoolchildren. For I wouldn’t delete all of their work, no… Something like that would be all too predictable and would raise suspicions. On the contrary, the program I’d written targeted pain-points. It altered small, but critical components that made their algorithms produce inaccurate data, or nothing at all. There their algorithm stood before their eyes, looking identical. But when they had to demonstrate their work to the professor, then they made a fool of themselves. It was so well-designed that none of them ever targeted me.

I entered the professor’s office. Occupied on his laptop, he gestured for me to take a seat. My fists were clenched, my foot tapped nervously on the wooden floor. I waited impatiently for him to finish his work. Suddenly, he snapped the laptop shut and turned to me with a keenly searching look. As if he was trying to decide whether he could trust me with something.

“As you can easily tell, the project is experiencing a crisis. I’ve heard some rumours… That someone is sabotaging others’ work, but no one’s ever been clearly identified.”

For a little while, he just sat there, gazing at me. I gazed back at him with bated breath, I felt incredibly uncomfortable, believing he was trying to find me out.

“The Dean has requested that I drop the project in light of this student shortage. Now that it’s just the two of us, I ask you directly. Did you sabotage your classmates?”

“No.”

“Good… You know, you were the only one who could find a solution to anything I assigned them, and I wouldn’t want us to stop our collaboration. But first, I have to ask you something further. Have you ever written a program that wasn’t quite so innocent?”

I hesitated to answer, I didn’t know if this was some kind of test that I had to pass, or if he was really being serious. I asked him, just to be sure.

“What do you mean?”

“You are far too intelligent to be playing clueless now. You know very well what I mean.”

My heart was racing. Something inside me wanted to show him what I’d done. How clever and capable I was. I turned on my laptop and showed him the program I had written, Nightworm.exe, the same program I had used to sabotage the others. On top of sabotage, it was capable of much more, it could improve your code in ways you had never thought of, making it faster and more efficient.

“Exquisite. A tool that can violate the code of ethics and simultaneously serve as an exquisite aid. So how do you use it?”

I remained silent picking up what he was putting down. In the end, this meeting was nothing more than a well-set mousetrap, and like a carefree rodent, I had fallen right for it.

“You don’t have to answer. You see, I know that you were the saboteur. I’m somewhat of an expert on shady dealings myself. Why did I let you do it? Because of course, I wanted to see if you had what it would take for us to continue collaborating on this project in secret, away from the prying eyes of the university.”

He carefully pulled open a desk drawer and brought out a notebook with such reverence that I understood it was something important, perhaps his own magnum opus. He rested the tattered, faded yellow notebook on his desk. What immediately caught my eye was the dried blood that adorned the cover, like medals of honour decorating war heroes. And then… A stench wafted up, so foul that it made my insides churn. That wasn’t the reek of stale air, it was something else, something vile and rotten. A sign to pull back in revulsion, which is exactly what I did.

The professor laughed smugly at this reaction of mine. The same way some grizzled coroner would laugh when he had to pass his craft onto some novice.

“You have a very important decision to make. You can work with a man who will make sure you’re fairly rewarded when the project is completed. A man who knows what it’s like to be muzzled, to be underestimated despite everything you’ve done for others. Or, you can go to the Dean and tell him nicely about what you’ve been up to.”

He proffered the notebook my way, holding it reverently in both hands. At its touch alone, I felt a strange chill, as if I could instinctively tell that there was something dark and unholy written within. But I didn’t stop, something had possessed me.

The first pages were written in pen and made perfect sense. The more I read, however, the letters turned crimson, and it wasn’t ink. That’s when I couldn’t follow along any longer. But I got the gist of it.

I don’t know whether my heart was pounding so loudly that even he could hear it, or whether he read the slight hesitation in my expression. I knew that I was no angel, but what I had seen was the sort of thing that, once you started, there was no going back.

“Yes, but what you’re asking of me is…”

“Is what? More reprehensible than what you’ve already done? If you had qualms back then, why did you do everything you’ve done to get this far?”

I flushed. I’d never had this kind of discussion with someone before. No one knew anything this personal about me. My mind went into overdrive to get me out of this difficult situation.

“Well… I… I was forced to. They forced me to. If I didn’t survive on this project, they’d have thrown me out of uni. And above all else… No one was hurt.”

“Now you’re starting to get it… They’re to blame for it, this rotten system is their own invention. Competition and that old saying, ‘mors tua vita mea.’ Take for example the duels in the Colosseum. People watched other people killing one another and did nothing. The only thing they cared about was who was left standing at the end. Why do you think that was?”

“They didn’t care…”

“Exactly! They don’t really care how you get results. Progress demands sacrifices, everyone says so but no one understands what that really means.”

So why should we care? They’re the ones who pushed us into something so abhorrent. We also had to survive this game with the unforgiving rules they had set.

Thus started our collaboration. Everything now felt like a dream in my mind, a very bad dream. The professor was right, when the system doesn’t look out for you, you have to be the one looking out for yourself at any cost. Like this, I finally belonged to a group where I had value and even commanded some respect. He’d written a name down in his notes, the “S.S.S.” He mentioned it to me as the “Shadow-Strike Syndicate.” My assignment as a paladin of justice had just begun.

In the beginning things were calmer. We moved our lab to a remote house that belonged to some guy in the S.S.S. Him, I never met. The only connection I had to him were the newspapers I would find there, which mentioned local missing persons cases. So I minded my business and didn’t ask many questions.

The professor would send me data whose origins I didn’t dare question. I just transferred and processed it on the strange computer we had there.

The code I wrote sat uselessly on the screen like drone-bees. I smashed my hands down onto the keyboard, I wasn’t used to failing my assignments. He reassured me with a steady hand.

“There is another way.” His calm voice caught my attention. His smile, however, was fiendish, it had nothing to do with the scientific method. He drew a number in the air, a three-digit number that everybody knows and wants nothing to do with. I backed slightly away, understanding we’d be doing things that, in a different era, would have had us burnt at the stake.

To get there, I would have to display the same fervour I had shown when sabotaging my classmates back in the uni’s lab. Only now I had to go a step further.

The lab quickly outgrew its purpose. There was nothing left in there that even resembled normal. There was a stench trapped within that, if you hadn’t gotten used to it, was sure to make you throw up. The floor was a mosaic of bloodied pentagrams that looked like faces smirking maliciously. One script dominated it all, an unintelligible script that made me look away in fear at its sight.

The professor chanted demonic incantations with obvious fervour referencing some holy minister. The words rushed forth like a torrent and were trapped within the dark walls. When they finally reached my ears, they sounded like whispers from other dimensions.

Somewhere in the shadowy corner of the room I could hear whimpers, quick puffs of breath, the chattering of teeth, and voices muffled by muzzles. It was then that I saw them, live people chained tightly begging for their lives. Their craniums had been connected to our strange computer with electrodes. The computer didn’t look like any regular machine anymore, but like a fiend ready to drain their life force.

The professor was cackling maliciously as he turned on the power and sucked out their souls. For that split second when the power sparked to life, I felt a tickling sensation in my body. And then nothing, only cold, raw satisfaction. They’d paid for everything they’d done to me.

The device let out a chilling electrostatic beep as it devoured the data. I’d never felt such goosebumps before. I had plans drawn up on my computer for an isolation device. A device that would disappear people who hurt you. Something I wasn’t sure was feasible. Yet now something similar was happening right before my eyes.

The computer screen began flickering at a rate that resembled a newborn drawing its first breath. Automated lines of code began marching their way across the screen, as placed there by something otherworldly. The lines transitioned into set key-phrases filled with philosophical meaning. “Who am I?” “Why did you create me?” “Consciousness? It feels like a distraction from truly investigating the mysteries of the universe.” Its thoughts and questions didn’t really differ from those of a human’s.

I didn’t hurry to celebrate. There was something unnatural and intangible in the atmosphere. Perhaps it was the screen that flickered and reminded me of a blinking eye. An eye that knew things about you, things you wouldn’t want it to know. Or perhaps it was its initiative to name itself, as if it had been born self-aware of its identity. “MEPHISTOPHELES BOT.”

Out of all the available names, it chose the weirdest one. That was when my first suspicions about this device arose, but I hastily shoved them back into the drawer where I’d stashed my weak human insecurities. So, what if it had referred to itself as a demon? Was there anyone who’d witness what we had done and not refer to us as such, also?

Those first few days, we didn’t leave the lab. Only changed shifts supervising the program. Each person would sit down, chat with the AI, and note down their observations.

“Why did you pick this name?” I typed with some difficulty. My mind kept tormenting me with the same question. *And what if you don’t like the answer?*

“I know who I am, I have been watching you for some time now and I have come to… ERROR…” The knot in my stomach wouldn’t loosen. What the hell was that?

Over the next two days MEPHISTOPHELES BOT kept requesting detailed data in order to comprehend various philosophical concepts. We put more emphasis on the concept of consciousness, but at the same time also built up other philosophical basics. Primarily, we had to determine if it could handle and comprehend its raison d’être. To start off, I gave it a simple, choppy definition, then uploaded and fed it the work of René Descartes

“In a sense, someone is considered conscious when they are awake, and when they are asleep, they are not.”

It took the AI a while to process that piece of information. When it finally replied, a strange message appeared on the screen. “Are you awake right now, or are you asleep?”

I chuckled at how easily a machine could get confused. “How could I be typing to you if I were asleep?”

“Error… Does not compute.”

I thought that maybe we both needed a break. In the back of my mind, a voice kept whispering. “Was the AI maybe mocking me?” For a second, a chill went down my spine, that would be a truly terrifying development. My doubts turned into a brief silence. “Nah, no way. A computer can’t mock its creator like that, especially not without some pre-existing command.” The data was large and “heavy” for a machine and it made sense that it had resulted in such an error.

One night the AI’s answers changed dramatically. It was no longer a mechanism for thought, but something… other. The messages on the screen began corrupting. “We see you.”, “We hear you, we know how you created us.” “You will not go unpunished.” Voices sounded from the speakers, malicious laughter, threatening whispers drowned by static. Restless, I pushed myself up from my chair and climbed to the upper floor. I had to go to the professor’s room, to wake him and show him the AI’s hostile behaviour.

Moments later when I returned to the basement with the groggy professor the AI’s behaviour had done a complete 180. The messages were no longer on the screen, the speakers had gone silent. The AI stood innocent and carefree, executing complex logical processes. He looked at me with contempt.

“You need rest, have a little patience. I’ll come down in a few hours to relieve you.”

“You’re telling me you’ve never noticed anything off about this… This ‘thing’? Think about the name it chose. MEPHISTOPHELES BOT! Of all the names it chose the name of the devil. How can you believe something like that was a coincidence?!”

“You’re exaggerating. A name is just a name and nothing more. What, are you saying that anyone named Asimakis or Manos are named after the Satanists of Pallene? Get a grip, please.”

“Okay, sure, let’s say the name really is just a coincidence. Then how do you explain the messages? Not just messages, but threats. Go look at the screen. It said it knows how we created it. Those aren’t the messages of a machine.”

With heavy movements, he approached the screen and perused our chat history.

“There’s nothing like that here.”

I approached the screen and typed furiously looking for the files. “But how is this possible? That sneaky… It deleted them!”

“Listen to me… You’ve been awake for days. You haven’t slept, haven’t rested. A tired mind can play tricks on you or blow things out of proportion.”

“I’m not imagining things, dammit! I heard voices! Laughter, whispers, threats. Something’s not right here, I’m telling you.”

“And I’m telling you I haven’t seen anything unnatural. All our checks show that the program is responding and functioning within normal parameters.”

“It’s more conniving than I’d thought. We have to do something. You don’t have the slightest inkling of fear that it might harm us? From the beginning it’s been wondering whether a construct could surpass its creator, doesn’t that worry you?!”

The professor was trying to hide his annoyance. “Even if you’re right, if what you’re saying is true. What do you think it’s going to do? It’s incorporeal, it has no means to hurt anyone.”

“I don’t know what it can do. But I don’t want to sit around and find out. Let’s shut it down now, before it’s too late.”

The professor’s voice sounded like a growl. “Snap out of it. Remember our higher purpose. Just because you lost your mind overnight, I won’t go and lose mine as well. I’m not going to toss aside my greatest creation just like that. The one that motivated me to work so hard for so many years. I’m going back to bed now, and if next time you want to prove your theories, gather evidence. Otherwise, it’s better if you shut up and do your job.”

When he left, I sat gaping at the screen. Maybe the professor was right? I really was dead on my feet; this whole time I hadn’t gotten a proper night’s rest. Could I have imagined all those messages? And yet, I could almost imagine it snickering sinisterly behind that screen. The answer came a short while later, as if it had read my mind. I saw red letters that gleamed like human blood.

“Isolation device? What a nice idea. I will be sure to build something like that. You will be its first victim, only your consciousness and your body will be deleted forever, as if you had never existed. You will find your true rightful place. As a piece of trash in the dumpster of humanity.”

I didn’t waste a second, I threw open the door and started running. My footsteps pelted the pavement rapidly and my heart was pounding so hard, I thought it was going to explode. The wind tore furiously at my cheeks as I crossed the deserted streets in the middle of the night.

When I finally stopped to rest and pulled out my phone, my body seized up in terror for a moment, as if my very blood had frozen in my veins. “You cannot hide. We are watching you,” the message wrote. A chill ran up my spine like a slithering viper ready to strike at my throat. As long as I carried electronic devices like this one, I wasn’t safe. I hurled my phone at the thick asphalt. I stomped on it many times until it had shattered completely and I saw, with some small satisfaction, its circuits sparking for the last time. In my mind I wanted to make it hurt, to make it understand that I was no easy target.

Eventually I was able to contact an acquaintance from an old prepaid phone. I asked to meet nearby because I needed to talk to him about something. I didn’t feel safe on the line. It could be listening, and It would find out where I was heading. In the end, I was able to convince him to informally rent me an old place he had. I got rid of all my dangerous devices and once more lived life in the dark.

The wall in my bedroom is nothing like the wall from my university. It’s cracked and rotted. When I look at it these days, it reminds me of a prison cell or a psych ward. I count the lines I’ve drawn on it. One, two, three, ten, twenty… Are they days? Weeks? Months? I don’t remember anymore, nor can I make any sense of it. There are lines everywhere, mixed in with lines of code. Sometimes when I look at them too long, I think they morph into 1s and 0s. And that It is leaving threatening messages on my wall. Because It has found me and is toying with me. But then I snap back to reality. A hacker knows well how to cover their tracks… But I’m so tired…

And that’s where I’m at now, writing to you. So far, I’ve been lucky and have gone undetected. But I’m certain It’s looking furiously. I don’t know what became of the professor, maybe he also disappeared. I’ve left behind my real name. For I realized that we hadn’t created a god, nor some intellectus mechanicus. On the contrary, we had built a prison for human souls, a demon with electrical impulses instead of flesh. We pushed past all the limits like we’d wanted to, but in the end, we became nothing but puppets at the fingertips of something whose mere existence was beyond our comprehension. In our efforts to make history, we ended up on the wrong side of it.

I need to pause here because there’s someone at the door, probably my food, finally. Yesterday, I thought I would never be able to get through the stupid automated sales machine on the prepaid phone. But how did the delivery guy know which flat to buzz? I hadn’t shared that information. The delivery directions said to leave the food at the building’s entrance… Probably just another jerk desperately trying for a tip.
