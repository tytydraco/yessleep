“Why don’t you just go to the beach! “Carlos’ brother shouted, slamming the door. Carlos thought his brother must have gone crazy. Not only did he have no way to get to the beach he was locked out wearing sweats and a tank top. Carlos had had no desire or intention to be wandering around the streets today. Just standing around in the summer heat felt exhausting.  His brother had muscled him out of their tiny apartment in order to get some privacy with his girlfriend. Carlos didn’t care what the reason was. No reason was good enough for him to be getting cooked on the sidewalk.

 

With no money in his pockets and few other options he walked down the boulevard heading toward the corner market. If the shop was busy, he might be able to steal a drink or some snacks. If not, he could at least relax in the AC till the owner kicked him out.

 

The walk over to the store wasn’t far but there was no shade anywhere to be found. Carlos could feel the sweat pouring off him by the time he reached the parking lot. Unfortunately for him the parking lot was empty. That wouldn’t be a good sign for being able to sneak out a drink or some snacks. *At least I can get out of this heat.*

 

Carlos walked into the shop soaking in the blast of cold air that greeted him. His relaxation was short lived though. Moving through the store the owner watched him like a hawk. He slowly wandered down the aisles enjoying the relief from the sun. Time flew by as he tried to look interested in various items, picking them up and putting them back down on the shelf. The owner got tired watching Carlos finally snapping, “This isn’t a hang out you know! It’s a store for paying customers. If you aren't going to buy anything, just get out.

“Hey, I was just about to make my purchase, but if this is how you treat your customers I’m out of here.”

“Yeah, yeah get out of here!” the owner said, waving him off with his hand.

 

Carlos backed out of the store gesturing at the owner. Turning around he almost ran into a motorcycle parked in the middle of the parking lot. The heat already had him on edge and with the owner yelling at him he was ready to explode. He looked around ready to yell at whoever had left their bike haphazardly in the middle of the parking lot. Only no one was around. The way the bike had been left he figured the owner couldn’t have gone far. Strangely though he hadn’t noticed anyone else in the store.

 

Waiting for the owner to return Carlos looked over the bike. The street style motorcycle looked brand new freshly painted matt black. The more Carlos looked over the bike the more jealous and angrier he got. Glancing back around the parking lot he was surprised that there was still no one in sight. When he looked back down at the bike, he got an even bigger surprise. The keys were dangling from the ignition. Carlos had no idea how he had missed it before.

 

*Why not borrow the bike for a little joy ride? If the owner really cared about it he wouldn't have been so careless. Besides it’s not like things don’t go missing here all the time. Let's just take it around the block.*

 

Swinging his leg over the bike Carlos settled into the seat. Cautiously he looked around again making sure that there was no one in sight. He smiled, turning the key in the ignition and the motorcycle rumbled to life. Gripping the handles Carlos sat revved the bike shooting off down the boulevard. He didn’t have much of a plan other than to catch a breeze before ditching the bike.

 

Speeding down the boulevard he spotted one of his friends walking by. He slowed down to shout and wave, but realized something was wrong. His hands wouldn’t come off the bike. Jerking at his hands he swerved dangerously around in the lane. No matter how much he fought, his hands stayed locked around the throttle. Carlos let off the throttle trying to slow the bike to a stop. The bike had a different plan in mind, steadily increasing its speed.

 

Carlos held on for dear life as the bike raced down the streets getting faster by the second. His heart raced pounding in his chest. It was all he could do to weave between the cars narrowly avoiding collisions. Looking ahead his heart froze, the next traffic light cutover to red. Cars flooded through the intersection blocking his path. Carlos lowered his head against the bike, closing his eyes and screaming.

 

Horns blared and steel crumbled as cars collided with one another trying to avoid the motorcycle. A moment later Carlos opened his eyes, shocked to find himself through the intersection in one piece. Over his shoulder he could see people starting to climb out of the wreckage shouting at one another. He also saw a set of red and blue flashing lights. With his face buried in the motorcycle he hadn’t seen the cop waiting at the intersection. Not that he could have stopped the bike.

 

 Racing toward the highway Carlos hoped the cop was too preoccupied with the wreck to pursue him. As he merged onto the highway bridge a quick glance in his side mirror confirmed he wasn’t that lucky. The cop’s flashing lights were quickly approaching from behind as he merged onto the bridge. This was quickly becoming his worst nightmare. Stuck on the six mile stretch of the Franklin bridge with nowhere to hide. His only option was to try to outrun the cop. 

 

The sun gleaming off the ocean water below was blinding as Carlos weaved his way through the traffic. Despite his reckless weaving through traffic the cop was still closing the distance. A loud voice shouted over the cop’s megaphone “PULL OVER!”. Carlos could see the cop car pulling up beside him out of the corner of his eye. All the joy was gone from his brief ride and he was more than ready to pull over. But his hands were still locked tight to the bike and it showed no signs of slowing down. He uselessly pulled at the bike throttle hoping to coax out more speed.

 

To his own surprise the bike shot forward at an alarming rate quickly leaving the cop behind. As the bike accelerated, so did the wind blowing into Carlos’ face. Bringing his eyes to a squint he could barely keep them open. A few seconds later Carlos was forced to shut his eyes completely. The violent rush of air from passing other cars drowned out all the other sounds. It was terrifying white noise filling the time before his inevitable crash. Carlos fought to keep the bike straight, but it started to drift. Panicking, he pulled at the handles to the left trying to keep his balance. Then jerking the bike back to the right. Through frantic adjustments Carlos lost any sense of where he was on the road. Without warning the front of the bike lifted up into the air. If Carlos hands hadn’t been locked to the handles, he would have been sent flying off the back.  Expecting the bike to rush forward he clung to the bike with his entire body. Instead, he felt weightless.

 

Forcing his eyes wide open he saw a massive teal rushing towards him. It took his brain a second to catch up, realizing it was him rushing toward the ocean. The bike had careened over the railing and was hurtling toward the water below. The fall felt like it was ripping Carlos' stomach right out of his body. His mind told him to scream but there wasn’t any time to. Instead, he took a last desperate gasp for air. The bike smashed against the surface causing an eruption of water.

 

Submerged underwater he propped his legs on the bike trying to stand up and rip his arms free. Standing up against the seat his feet began to sink into the bike. The black body of the bike began to twist and morph in the water. It started to collapse into a large black blob then stretch out into something new. A long horse’s head began to stretch its way out of the blob that Carlos was stuck to. At the same time four long legs started to pull out from the blob forming the horse's legs. Then the large torso formed, still latching onto Carlos’ limbs. The bike’s new horse form began to solidify, and it started to kick its legs. The kicking became a gallop, dragging Carlos deep toward the ocean floor.

 

Pressure built up in Carlos’s lungs as he struggled to hold his breath. He was quickly running out of time. Pulling himself toward the horse he opened his mouth wide letting out a large air bubble. With desperation racing through his mind, he bit down hard on the horse's neck. Reeling from the bit it spun in a circle creating a whirlpool underwater. The whirlpool kicked up sand and debris from the ocean floor. Carlos’ vision started to darken looking back towards the surface. The dim glow of the sun was fading away. The last bit of air coughed out from his body making way for water to flood into his lungs.

 

Feeling his body go limp, the horse finally released him, setting him adrift in the ocean.
