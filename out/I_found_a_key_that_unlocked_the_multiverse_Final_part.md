This new dimension I had found myself in hit me straight away with an intense heat unlike anything I had ever experienced before. I was inside a room and the heat was already causing me to sweat, my breathing was laboured from fear but I knew I had to use the door again to get away from the creature. As I went to put the key in the lock the door started opening meaning that thing was already coming through so I had to run. The other side of the room had another door but no keyhole so I ran through it and happened upon what looked to be a huge abandoned warehouse.

I took a quick glance around but saw no doors, what I did notice though was a huge opening on the other side of the building. This led outside but I noticed a strong red tinge to the landscape but tried not to think about it yet as I knew I had to get away from that creature. I managed to run outside when the heat intensified so much that I found it hard to breath, it was then that I noticed the red colour I was seeing was because there were fires everywhere.

Buildings, trees and even bodies I noticed were burning, the sight and smell almost caused me to pass out but my adrenaline kept me going. I walked for hours trying to find a door I could use to get out of this dimension but saw nothing as every possible place I could find a door was already burnt or still burning and to dangerous to enter. The only thing I could do was keep searching, it was after another few hours I finally saw some people in the distance and started making my way towards them. When I was in sight of them the only thing I could manage to say before passing out was “water!”

I’m not sure how long I was out but when I awoke I came to find myself tied to a chair surrounded by these people in all black robes. I tried to understand what was happing and looked at one of them and asked what is happening and why am I tied up. The person I was looking at stepped closer to me and whispered “Child of god, what is it you believe?” I didn’t understand the question so repeated what I asked first but this time trying to sound a little more authoritative, which just came out shakily. The person then looked me directly in the eye and shouted “we the sons of lucifer demand your faith, you will no longer be a child of god. We are as one and will bring about the rise of our father once more!”

I’ve never been religious and tried my best to sound sincere when I told them I would do whatever it is they asked but they just laughed and we’re all shouting “blasphemer!” They kept repeating this over and over for hours and hours all whilst the one who first started asking me questions was muttering under his breath in a different language, I believe it was Latin but honestly am not 100% sure as I only speak English. Whilst this was happing I was actively trying to get free not caring that they were staring at me I just knew that I had to get away. I ended up exerting so much energy I passed out again.

Suddenly a huge crashing sound woke me up and I noticed the people were no longer Round me, in fact I couldn’t see them anywhere. I heard another huge ceasing sound but this time closer and another and another, each time it was come closer and making the floor shake. My mind was racing but I knew I had to get out and now so I started really pulling at the restraints trying to either break them or hoping they would loosen enough. The crashing sound stopped and I looked to my left and what I saw chilled me to my very soul, there standing as large as a house was a monster at least that’s the only explanation I could come up with for what I was seeing.

It was dark and humanoid with huge claws even bigger teeth but it’s eyes are what caused me to unashamedly admit I pissed myself in terror. The eyes were black and infinite like I was staring into nothing yet seeing everything. I couldn’t take my eyes off it and knew that this was the end so i stopped struggling and began pleading with this beast to let me go, I tried everything I could think of to convince it to just let me go when it raised its hand and with a swipe created 3 huge cuts on my abdomen. I screamed in agony as my blood started flowing onto my legs and down to the floor, the creature raised its hand again and I knew I wouldn’t survive another swing so bowed my head closed my eyes and succumbed to the inevitable.

Nothing happened so I open my eyes and to my horror I was back in the very room that creature took me to question me, I was still tied up but in utter defect as I panned my head across the room there it was the weird static faced suit wearing thing. I just started crying I think mainly due to the fact that I was just utterly and totally exhausted and knew that my fight had all but dissipated. My chest and stomach still hurting from the 3 larges gashes I just said to the creature “kill me, I’m done running and I don’t know fuck all about this key or where it came from so just FUCKING kill me!” This creature just stood there and looked at me or at least I think it was looking at me with its static face.

“You are telling the truth aren’t you?” The creature said, “yes, I’m just done and want out of this nightmare so kill me and get it over with.” I didn’t even have the energy to shout this time and just waited for it to kill me, I waited for what felt like forever and at one point thought it would kill me by letting me bleed out from my wounds. It was after about 10 minutes of me just sitting there in anticipation that the creature said “what would you do to get out of this alive?” I turned my head to it in disbelief and obviously said “I would do anything to get out of this, I want to live I just thought that you wanted to kill me as that’s what you said last time” the creature pulled out a tool and held it near my wounds and with the press of a button my cuts closed and didn’t even leave a scar.

It then untied me and said “I want to show you something that will change your life forever and I will give you a choice and depending on what path you choose will decide the fate of so many universes” it opened a door that appeared on the wall and beckoned me to follow it. I got up and with nothing left to lose decided why not, as I followed beside it I asked “what are you, where do you come from, where is this…?”

“I promise I will answer your questions very soon but I need you to follow me first” it interrupted. We came to a set of double door which it opened and on the other side were rows upon rows of cages. I couldn’t even guess the number if I tried it looked like it went in forever. I noticed each and ever cage had a person in it dressed in a jumpsuit and metal mask.

The creature suddenly said “you want to know what I am and what it is I want, well to answer your first question let me show you” it started pulling up on the static which was a mask this whole time and as it came off all I could muster up was “what the fuck” you see it was me I was staring at another me, I tried to compose myself and before I could say anything the other me said “as for what I want is well simple, I want you. I want every single version of us. The cages are filled with us from different dimensions and I want every last one” I stated in disbelief and simply asked “why?” Before the other me had chance to answer I remember he said he was going to give me a choice so I question him on what this choice was.

“That is also simple. You see you will become a member of my collection but your choice is either you become a member today and you will be mine till the end of time or you help me gather other versions of us meaning you get to experience the closest you will get to freedom ever again” I felt a lump in my throat but knew the only thing I could choose was to help him so I said I will help to which he looked at me and smiled. “Let’s get started then, you will continue to use your key to travel and track down the other us’es and once located you will use this (he handed me a device with a button) to signal me and I will come and get the other one of us” I wanted to throw up but knew I had to do what he said. “One last thing. As you have already worked out I can track you anywhere and everywhere so do t run otherwise I will drop you off in a dimension that makes the last one look like heaven”

He showed me a door and said “now go and make us proud” I stepped through the door and ended up on your earth this is where I am currently, I have to do what he says but each earth I visit I will post this story on some form of website and tell you this. There is someone out there beyond your universe but with the ability to travel here whenever he wants you need to prepare yourself as I have a feeling if he is even the slightest bit like me then he is collecting every version of us for a reason and that reason I believe is to eradicate all lives but us. I’ve located the me from your universe so I need to press the button meaning I won’t be able to post anymore but please I beg of you to get ready and fight as every last one of you will die at our hands trust me.
