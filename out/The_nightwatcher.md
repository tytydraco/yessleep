I am a 28-year-old female, and this is an incident that happened to me last week. I live in a small town, small enough for the map to not even display it. I was always an insomniac and stayed awake till 4 in the morning. Every night at around 2 a.m., I could hear a rustling sound of footsteps in my backyard. Before getting any further, I would like to give an outline of my property. It’s a long plot with half of the area covered with big trees and the front half has the building that we live in. Our house is a three-story building and we have a large backyard. 

I would come home every summer from my university to spend my vacation with my family. I live with my parents and my younger sister. Every summer vacation, I come to stay for about a month and spend really quality time at home. The days are perfect, but the nights are miserable for me. Every night I would stay awake late and had awful experiences regarding the sounds I mentioned earlier. 

One day, I decided to confront whoever was making such noise at such late hours of night. I was a fool and decided not to wake my parents up. My room was just beside an open corridor that led straight to the backyard. I still remember it to be a Saturday night. As the clock struck 2, I could hear the rustling noise again. I slowly crept down my bed and opened the door. It made a slight noise and the rustling stopped. I took my phone with me and started walking with my flashlight on. I couldn’t see anything at first. As I approached through the darkness, I could see a black figure crouching in the distance, hiding behind an oak tree. I was scared shitless at this point, but something in me told me to keep walking. My reaction was involuntary and I had no control over my body. 

I slowly approached the figure, which at this point had stood up and I could see its yellow glowing eyes. My phone had stopped working at this point, the battery had died out. Moon was the only source of light I could use to traverse my path. As I was inches away from the figure, it let out a shrieking noise and opened its mouth wide. My eyes had adjusted to the dark and I could see hundreds of razor-sharp teeth protruding from its face. The creature was about 8 feet tall, skinny and covered with a slimy substance all over its body. I was frozen with fear and couldn’t move my feet. The creature slowly inched close towards me. It started to make a low growl and a weird hissing noise. It was only inches from my face at this point and I could smell its rotting breath. 

The creature said in a raspy voice, “fresh flesh”. I immediately came back to my senses, turned back and started running towards my room. It was fast and as I was about to enter my room, it blocked my way. 

“I am the night-watcher”, it rasped. 

I started sobbing at this point. 

“I want you”, it said.

I was petrified and just stood there motionless. The creature then jumped over me and bit a chunk from my hand. I was so scared that my voice had died out in my throat. It started to tear off flesh from my legs. I was deeply in pain and slowly, I fainted. 

I was awoken next morning by my mother. I saw around me and I could understand that I was laying in a hospital bed. The doctors said that I was attacked by an animal and that I had to stay there for about a week. My parents were standing beside me and my mother was in tears. My arms and legs were wrapped in bandages and I couldn’t move, as I was in great pain. 

Today I am writing this post from the hospital. My scars are healing fast and my eyes are turning yellow. My skin is changing texture and has taken a greasy yellow form. The doctors think I have jaundice. I am afraid to go home and mostly afraid that I’m turning into the next night-watcher. I hope this post finds someone who knows what I am going through and can hep me reverse this transformation.
