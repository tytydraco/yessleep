A few days ago, I met a strange kid. I’m posting the encounter here in case anyone has ideas or suggestions about what happened. (And because the people involved will probably see it if I post on my social media.)

It is currently my half term break from uni and originally, I had just planned on spending the time at home, watching TV, and vaguely glancing at essay assignments. But as I’m a great niece (with a £50 bribe) I'm helping my aunt and uncle move house instead. 

They're not moving a great distance. They live an hour or so away from us, up in the old valleys. In a town that has been run-down since the closure of its iron and coal mines. It has a standard, copy and paste arrangement of buildings, with local shops that are small, damp, and like old women, huddle together against the graphic chain stores. And off down the side streets you can find a church or two, tucked away like the shy, overlooked cousins to the cheap, tatty pubs. And all this watched over by the bald, stout mountain with nothing but ferns, heather and disused miner’s paths to cover it.

Not the nicest place, but hey, run down means cheap. Which is something my uncle can get behind. And the new (cheaper) house is just a little further up the mountain than their current one.

So, my uncle is carting everything up and down in his small blue car instead of shelling out for a moving van. 

We tackled the kitchen first. The toaster, kettle, bread maker, set of 5 blending cups, and other essentials; we chucked loosely into some banana boxes. The bigger stuff, however, was hard work. 

Wedging the oven into the back of the car was easy enough but un-wedging it was a bloody nightmare. I strained against the thing for a good half an hour, going at it from different angles but couldn't get it to budge. I got hot, frustrated, and in a final effort, I booted the back of it. My uncle roared about me having to replace it if I broke it, so I gave in and went back up to the empty house.  
  
I made us both a cup of tea and we strategised about how to get the hulking thing out of the tiny car. We considered shoving a bit of loose timber underneath and shimmying it out, but the scraps of wood we found in the back garden were all too thick. We took up our mugs again and decided to survey the problem from the front window. But our problem had already been solved.

A kid of around twelve or thirteen was out on the short street, hugging the cooker which was then about two thirds of the way out.   
‘What the fuck?’ fell out of my mouth. Was that kid crazy strong or we were just idiots? The boy wore an orange long-sleeve shirt with a faded white logo and a pair of grey joggers. His hair was blonde and stuck out from his head. I couldn't tell if he was tall because he was hunched over the oven, but I got the impression that he was. 

My uncle rocked on his heels, whistled and said  
‘Why am I paying you when that kid does it for free?’   
‘I've done loads actuall-‘ I was cut off by a squeal. The oven had been pulled out of the car but had scraped the back of it as it went.  
‘That’s why,’ I winced. But my uncle hadn’t heard me or ignored me. He rapped his knuckles on the glass.  
‘Oi!’   
He stormed out of the room, out the front door and marched down to the boy. 

‘What do you think you're playing at!?’ My uncle is a short man, and he flew out in rage to a boy who when stood up, turned out to be very tall. Taller than my uncle. The fireworks simmered and my uncle tried again with a more reasonable approach.   
‘What are you doing, lad?’ he coughed.

The boy stood awkwardly and pulled at the side of his shirt, looking nervous and twitchy.

I left the house and joined them at the edge of the sloping front garden. Up close, the boy’s face and expressions were uncomfortable to look at. His features were gaunt, cast in shadow and his eyes were fearful.   
‘What are you doing?’ My uncle asked again. The boy didn’t answer but determination crossed his face, and he began to drag the oven out into the street.  
‘OI!’ My uncle shouted and grabbed the opposite side of the oven to pull it back from the boy.  
‘You can’t just take things!’ My uncle was incredulous at this random kid so openly trying to steal his stuff. I was too. What the hell did this boy want with an oven?  
  
The kid tugged harder and started to look desperate. In the bizarre confusion I grabbed the side that my uncle was wrestling with and helped him pull it free. The boy fell back as we wrenched it from him and landed on the pavement. He began to cry.  
‘Shit,’ I hissed.  
I came around the oven and offered my hand to help him up  
‘Are you alright?’  
‘Please,’ he whimpered, ‘let me give it to them.’ He got on his knees and pulled at my shirt.  
‘Please please please’ he begged. Repeatedly asking us for the oven so he could give it to someone. My uncle had stepped back, weirded out and protective of his oven.  
‘Who?’ I asked, ‘who do you want to give it to?’  
‘The Bone Grubbers,’ he whispered.  
  
The Bone Grubbers? I was pretty freaked out. We did manage to get the oven into the house in the end, after the boy’s mother had come to collect him. She apologised to us and said that Luke (that’s not his name but it’s what I’ll call him for discretion) didn’t usually go any further than her front garden, which is right next door to my uncle’s new place. His mother explained in a hushed roundabout way, that Luke had witnessed a crime at a young age and had behavioural difficulties as a result. I think she told us this because she wanted us to know that he might be a handful as a neighbour but that he was a good kid and his actions weren’t entirely his own fault.  
She was really apologetic and seemed nice, if not exhausted.  
  
When we went back down to my uncle's old house, we told my aunt about it (although my uncle only relayed the part where someone was trying to steal from him). I asked her what a ‘Bone grubber’ was and she told me it was just an old name for the rag and bone man.  
  
While they got on with putting stuff into boxes, I played on my phone for a bit and decided to Google ‘Bone Grubbers’. A definition for it came up and, as my aunt had said, it was just another name for a rag and bone man. ‘Bone Grubbers’ didn’t have an article of its own but was included in the rag and bone Wiki. The Wiki said that in the 19th century, people who lived in poverty, in cities like London or Birmingham, would collect scraps that could be sold for a few pence. It was generally rags that they collected or scrap metal like horseshoe nails and brass. But their collections sometimes included bones. Bones could be sold for use as knife handles or for the grease that could be extracted from them. That’s probably where the grimy sounding name comes from.  
  
Now that I’ve read about them, they seem a lot less sinister than their name suggests. I mean, we have rag and bone men now, they’ve just evolved into driving vans and taking away scrap metal. And they certainly don’t go around collecting bones anymore. But where had Luke picked up on the name? I didn't know what it was. And why had he started using it like the name of a boogeyman? I don’t know. If you have any suggestions or know if the name appears elsewhere, I’d love for you to comment.  
  
I have visited my aunt and uncle’s since, and I’ve seen Luke out in his front garden. I’ve tried asking him questions, but he doesn’t respond. He just sits and stares past his gate, like he’s looking out for something.

I’m curious about the crime his mother told us he’d been a witness to, but I won't (and probably shouldn't) find out from him. 

I'm going to my uncle’s tomorrow. They're pretty much moved in now, but I'm free and interested in this thing. So, I might try to talk to Luke's mum instead, strike up a conversation with her. I'll keep you posted if I learn anything more.
