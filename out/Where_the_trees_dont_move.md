I don’t remember why I came out here. Just that I needed to leave—my apartment, the city, my phone buzzing with messages I didn’t care about anymore. Everything was noise. Everything felt like pressure behind my eyes. So I drove. I didn’t plan a route. I took back roads, then dirt roads, then nothing. Just a tree line and the feeling that I was finally away from whatever had been clawing at me.

I left the car at the edge and walked in.

At first, it was peaceful. The air was cool and damp, and the only sounds were the crunch of my boots and the occasional distant birdcall. I felt like I was sinking into something ancient, something that didn’t care about deadlines or phone calls or whatever I was trying to escape.

I thought I’d hike a little, write in my journal, and come back.

But I never found the same path twice.

I tried marking trees. I scraped bark with my keys, broke low branches. But somehow, when I turned around—nothing was where I left it. The tree I marked was gone. The branch I snapped was whole again.

I laughed at first. Maybe I was just disoriented. Forests could be like that, right?

But the laughter didn’t last.

The forest was wrong. Too still. There was no wind, no rustling, no life beyond my own. Even my breathing felt loud. The deeper I went, the more the silence pressed in on me like a hand around my neck.

I thought I saw something, just ahead. Between two trees—a structure. It looked like a cabin, or what was left of one. I approached, hoping for shelter, or maybe even a way out. It was old, wooden, sagging inward like it had been forgotten a long time ago. The door hung open slightly, like it had been waiting.

Inside, it was dark. The smell was damp and sour, like mold and something faintly sweet—decay. The walls were carved with words. Names, mostly. Dozens of them. Some in shaky cursive, others in jagged block letters. Many were scratched out violently, deep gouges that tore through wood.

And then I saw my name.

Not just my first name. My full name. Carved neatly. Fresh.

I backed away slowly, heart pounding. I didn’t hear anything, but I felt something behind me. The forest again. When I turned back, it had changed.

The trees were closer. There was no path. No space between trunks. Like the woods had crept forward when I wasn’t watching.

I ran. I didn’t look where—I just moved. The trees watched. I know they watched. Not with eyes, but with something deeper. Old. Patient.

Eventually, I collapsed. Couldn’t tell how far I’d gone, or how long I’d been running. Night had fallen again. Or maybe it had always been night.

That was when I found my journal.

It was open. A page near the back. My handwriting—shaky, like it had been written in a rush. But I never wrote this.

“Stop running. Lie down. Let it take you.”

The journal felt cold. Damp. Like it had been buried.

I haven’t slept. Every time I close my eyes, I hear breathing. Not mine. Slow. Rhythmic. Deep as the earth. And every time I blink, the trees get closer.

They never move when I watch.

But they’re always closer.

And they’re waiting for me to blink again.
