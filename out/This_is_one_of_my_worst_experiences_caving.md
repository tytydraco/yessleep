At this time I was no experienced caver and this was one of my first more advanced caves. it was just me and some friends Jan, and Tom.  Jan was one of those stereotypical hippies, blonde hair, colorful jacket, one of those nose piercings that make it look like you have little tusks and face covered  in freckles. Tom was about 24 at the time he was the reason we were here. He had a tall frame skinny perfect for caving short brown hair and acne covering his face. 

After we arrived and had some lunch it was burgers which where your basic camping burgers nothing special. Soggy tomatoes, old buns from someone's pantry, and meat just dry enough to be hard to chew. 

We had then entered the cave about an hour later. We brought a long wire about 500 meters long for internet connection. We needed this to live stream the cave and call 911 incase of emergency. As we entered I had gotten a sudden cold chill unbeknownst to me at the time but it was due to what was inside the cave. Gotten deeper when I had felt that same feeling it wasn't just me though I could see Jan was nervous too. She stopped for a short time but quickly went back to normal.

As we got deeper we took a break in an opening. It was cold and damp crawling with spiders We had a couple of energy bars. After I barely managed to take a bite out of mine the was a loud bang deeper in cave. We had brushed it of as a falling rock. But we should have left after hearing that sound because once we got deeper in the cave we would be past the point of no return.

 But we carried on we got to a tight squeeze. I was first to go as I got in I could feel the pressure on my chest. I had to go feet first due to it being a vertical drop. But as descended I felt something brush my foot. I yelped out in fear. Tom asked if I was okay. As I told him what happened I could feel that cold feeling again this time more intense but it quickly went away. We knew something was off but for some stupid reason we kept going

When we got deeper we heard that bang multiple more times the last few times they where more like screeches. At this time we had dropped the camera we were live streaming with. We kept going even though our bodies told us no it was like we were forced to.we got to another tight squeeze this time Jan went first. but this time it wasn't as simple as just dropping down. This time something was forcing us to go faster and so we did with no regard for our lives. We kept going deeper and deeper until we met a large opening. I had large gouges in my legs and arms. So did Jan and to. We looked around in the opening.
 
This opening was larger than anything we had ever seen. It was the size for a mansion it even look like something was living here. It was terrifyingly dark, cold, and damp.We heard that banging again this time louder then ever and longer than ever. I had felt that shiver again we all did. 

As we approached the source of the screech we could hear breathing. And when we approached we could see it standing there. It was large looked rotten skin hanging from its rib cage. Its large head had horns those of a ram. It legs were non existent they were clear barely visible in the dim light of our flash lights. 


Then the loud yell happens again for the last time.  The monster picked up Tom ripping him in half covering me and Jan in his blood, guts, and organs. This breaks me out of my trance I can finally move for myself and I do. I bleat off limping to the rest of the cave searching for a hiding spot.

I turn a corner in this maze like cave and I find I crawl space. As I hide I can hear Jan's bones being destroyed in the mouth of the beast. 

The monster walked searching for me and I fear that I might not have much time left so as I type this my final message. I will leave this cav...

Hi I'm nyambers and this is one of my first horror stories so don't be afraid to roast me in the comments of this post. I know it wasn't that good of a read I only took like an hour on this story.
