It's been hard to find a way to send this out, hopefully it works this time. After I posted last, I barricaded my apartment. I moved my couch, TV stand, and dining room table in front of the only door into my place but I left the doors to the fire escape open. I organized my food into perishable and non perishable, keeping what needed to be cool, refrigerated. I had my old backpacking bag packed with essentials just in case I had to make a quick exit. 

While I still had power, I turned the news on. I had hoped for something encouraging, but the situation was declining faster than our city authorities could handle. The National Guard was deployed as the police departments and hospitals were overrun with sick people, “going mad and attacking everyone they see.” The news broadcast showed footage of carnage. Large groups of people in the same, or worse, states as Helen were marauding the streets, preying on anyone who happened to bear witness to them. After several videos, I noticed a trend. The large groups of infected would be simply walking down the streets aimlessly, when suddenly their necks would crane upwards. Then, in unison, look in the direction of the next victim and overrun them. Some victims died, most became infected, joining the ever-growing hordes that slogged the city streets. Sometimes the victim was the cameraman. In those instances, I got a good look at some of the infected. They were menacingly inhuman. The whites of their eyes were all filled with blood and their skin looked dark and bruised, like someone with bubonic plague. And they were all covered in blood and feces. The best guess the Army doctors could come up with was that it was spread through contact with bodily fluids. *Why hadn’t I gotten sick?*  But their assumptions had yet to be verified. 

Like I said, I had some supplies ready: a big camping knife, a pot to boil water, a map and compass, a small tarp, and a sleeping bag. I felt prepared until it happened. When all plans to ‘survive, evade, resist, and escape’ went out the window. When Scott knocked on my door and begged to be let in.

I know I shouldn't have let him in, but he was crying so pathetically. I couldn’t find myself to be cruel enough for survival. As I moved the heap of apartment furniture away from the door to get him inside, my head began to ache again. Scott didn’t say a word to me, he just sat on the floor, quietly weeping. 

After replacing the barricade, I handed Scott a water and sat down across the empty floor of my living room from him. I rested my head against the wall, “Did you see the news?” I asked, unable to think of anything better to say. 

“My roommate turned on me…” He said. “She said she was sick and had to lay down. We were just sitting there watching TV together and, boom,” he said, gesturing with his hands a small explosion, "she's jumping on top of me, grabbing my throat, clawing and trying to bite me.” He sank his head between his knees and sniffled, “I had to kill her.” He mumbled something else but I didn’t hear; didn’t want to hear. Scott had been too close to his infected roommate. *Dammit.* I knew I shouldn’t have let him in. 

“You…killed her? Was there nothing else that could be done? Couldn’t you just run away or knock her out?” My fear was coming through my tone of voice.

“I had *no* other choice!” He lifted his head, bloodshot eyes locking with mine. I swear I saw the blood start to fill in the whites of them as we looked at one another. *I need to get out of here.* His eyes softened slightly, “I tried everything.” He hung his head and cried again. 

“What happened afterwards?” 

“I fucking ran man!” He said, incredulously. “I didn’t even think to grab anything, I just ducked out my back window and fucking bolted.” 

There was a moment or two of silence as Scott recollected his flight. “What I saw out there,” His voice took on a deeper tone, laced with rasp, “would make what I did to my roommate merciful.” 

Thunder clapped, making Scott and I jump. He began shivering slightly. The rain started and quickly grew to a deluge. Its sound was comforting, despite the situation. 

“Do you have any food?” Scott asked, after the sound of the rain turned to white noise. I gestured to the fridge behind him. 

As he rummaged through it, I silently made sure my belongings were in my backpack and zipped it up. He lifted some microwavable quesadillas, “Do you mind if I eat some of these?” 

I leaned my head back against the wall, feigning rest, “Yeah, sure.” 

He turned and popped the food into the microwave. *He would turn at any moment,* I thought as the microwave hummed.  He turned towards my direction and leaned against the counter top with his head down. I decided to risk sneaking out onto the fire escape. I raised myself to a kneeling position and reached my hand behind me. Thunder struck as I unlocked it, *Thank God.* The continual hum of rain pattering my roof covered the noise of my slowly sliding the window up. Scott didn’t seem to notice the sound of the rain getting louder so I seized this opportunity. I turned my back on him and stepped out into the rain. As I turned and started closing the window, the microwave beeped its clamorous signal. Scott looked up, fully turned. 

“Where the fuck are you going!” Gargled Scott. 

I started to run but he leapt and caught my foot, tripping me. 

Scott started screaming now. I could hear his clothes tear and his spit hit the floor as I writhed, trying to escape his grasp. I was astonished by how strong he was. I caught a glimpse of his face through the heavy veil of rain. His features were gruesome beyond reckoning. His furrowed brow brought recollections of angry demons, poised on destruction and torture. His devilish grin seemed to writhe as his tongue slithered over his teeth. This wasn’t a human anymore. 

Lightning flashed as Scott and I battled on the fire escape. I launched my foot into his face with a crunching sound. He wailed in agony and anger, grabbing his face with one hand but keeping the other firmly held on my ankle. I squirmed and tried to break free but his grip held. He removed his hand to reveal a bloodied complexion, his anger and anguish distinct in the deep lines of his growling visage. I kicked again once his hand was away and heard another crunch. This time his cries peaked as a pig squeals and he relinquished his clutch of my leg. I rolled over and practically leapt like a frog to the lower landing. The clamor of my body hitting the metal blended with the sound of the storm.

I waited no time for Scott and swung myself down the fire escape stairs, then down the ladder. I ran up the grassy knoll away from my complex, towards the highway. I began to thank the stars for allowing me to get away unharmed, when I realized what I left behind. I was so worried about escaping that I forgot to grab my backpack as I ran out. 

*Fuck!* I thought. I felt my pockets and thankfully had my phone and my pocket knife. If I get attacked, it might give me an upper-hand. 

When I realized I had my pocket knife, I heard a snarl and a thudding stride amongst the rain. I glanced over my shoulder and saw Scott, frothing. His arms flailed madly as his body propelled towards me, bent on gaining me as a conquest. I tried to pick up my pace but I couldn’t outrun him. His footsteps went silent for just a second, then I felt his body slam into mine, driving us both down a hill. We tumbled, entangled limbs of murder and defense, landing against a chain-link fence at the bottom of the hill. Unfortunately, he landed on top of me and was using his weight to bear down on my limbs. I tried to squirm my way out of his grip, to reach my pocket knife and stab him, but I couldn’t. Scott was leaning down closer and closer to my face, his wreaking breath and bloodshot gleaming eyes drowned my senses. His slimy mouth gaped and he was just about to bite when his neck jerked back, like an invisible puppet master had pulled tight his strings. He looked up at the sky expectantly, his neck bones crunching and grinding. Then as quickly as he looked up, he got off me and ran back towards the smoking city.  

I sat up and leaned against the fence. 

“What the fuck was that?” I said aloud. I looked up and around and saw nothing but gray clouds and ruined buildings. The coolness of the rain felt stark against my skin. I could feel my body heat mixing with the rain as I caught my breath. Eventually, I squatted up onto my haunches and pulled my knife out. I waited a while longer before I decided to hop the fence and continue on. 

As I approached the highway, I saw ahead of me the opening suburban sprawl, shrouded by the encroaching black clouds advancing from the city. Despite the lower population density, it seemed they had been plagued as badly as the city. Houses burned and people cried in the distance. The dying were moaning in the streets only for their shrieks to escalate as one of the diseased got ahold of them. I saw them, the sick and the living, running feverishly through their beloved col de sacs; their homes a warzone in less than twenty-four hours. My heart hung in my chest like raw meat in the rain and I fell to my knees. How could there be divinity in chaos such as this? Where was meaning and fulfillment in survival against such horrible foes? I stayed there kneeling, against my hindsight’s judgement, mourning the world I once knew. But my mourning was disturbed by strange noises filtering through the pour. I looked through my tears to see several of the recently infected stalking me. They peaked just over the knoll I came, crawling on the ground like animals, peering at me like predators. 

I ran into the desecrated suburbs, heeding the beasts behind me. Quietly I was thankful that my heavy breathing and steps could not be heard over the pandemonium of my surroundings. I ran through the backyards of this once pristine neighborhood: vaulting fences, dodging attacks, and leaping over corpses. The dead were all around, laying in the streets. As I ran, I saw no more infected, I just heard the several chasing me. 

Eventually, through many side streets and clever outmaneuvering, I lost my pursuers and rested in a hiding spot: behind a trash bin between two houses. The noise of the calamity befalling my city and its outskirts had dulled to the background, and in its place was the eerie quiet muffled with gentle rainfall. Once my breathing slowed I peaked from my hiding spot. After a quick look down the street, I began to sneak across, attempting to head due West, as far from this madness as I could go. But I was arrested by a human sound; of someone hissing to get my attention. I looked sharply ahead of me, trying to discern a human form amongst the disarray. I locked eyes with a young woman, wide eyed, through a boarded up shattered window. She was gesturing to my left. I looked to where she pointed and saw a horde of those things meandering their way towards our position about two hundred yards away. I winced when I saw them, a stab of pain shot through my skull. I looked back at the girl, frozen with fear. She pointed back to the alleyway behind me, made a lowering motion with her hand, then brought her finger to her pursed lips. I obeyed. 

I crept back into my hiding place and climbed into the large plastic trash bin. I waited for some time, perhaps a quarter of an hour before I started to hear them. Their gait sounded like newborn giraffes, stumbling and unpredictable. The horde pushed its way through the street while I cowered. I stayed as quiet as I could; my heartbeat sounded like a timpani in the waste bin. As time moved on, I calmed down and was able to listen to the swarm. Above their shuffling steps, I made out faint whispers, murmurs of humanlike voices. I couldn’t quite make out what they were saying, but they were saying it in unison. I considered lifting the lid to try and hear better but I decided against it. 

Eventually, their numbers dwindled and ceased, and I was able to crawl out. The woman was waiting patiently at her window. Upon seeing me she gestured fervently that I join her. Foolhardy or hopeful, I didn’t care. 

Despite being strangers, we embraced one another as I entered. Her gentle breathing and clinging arms squeezed tears out of me. We stood there together, renewing our hopes that not all was lost, for a moment, before letting go and sitting down before the window she had seen me through. 

“They’ve been coming by like this every hour or so.” She checked her watch, “I haven't been able to look away.” She said, almost ashamed. 

“My boss was the first infected one I saw. It seemed to take longer for her to become…” I coughed, ignorant of what I could say. “Have you noticed that they’re turning… *faster*?” I finished speaking as my head throbbed. *Here we go again, dammit*. “You wouldn’t happen to have any pain killers would you?” I groaned before she could answer. 

“I don’t have any. I didn’t have time to grab anything.” She groaned, rubbing her temples. “This isn’t my house so there might be some here. And yeah, I noticed they were changing faster too. Maybe the virus has evolved and gotten stronger?” 

I could only manage to shrug. The pain in my head was cresting. 

“Do you get migraines too? Mine have been horrible this whole time.” I said, briefly distracted from the pain. 

“Ever since I was a kid.” She looked up at me, still rubbing her temples, sympathy and woefulness filled her eyes. “My name is Amanda.” She said. 

“Jack.” I nodded in recognition of our now ‘formal’ introductions. “Would you mind if I took a look around?” 

“The refrigerator and the pantry are all emptied out. But I haven’t checked the medicine cabinets or any bedrooms yet.” 

I rose to scour the household for any supplies I could muster together. I ignored the kitchen and lower level, heading straight upstairs. I saw three doorways with a closet at the end of the hall. One of them had to be a bathroom, I assumed. I started with the closest one. It was a bedroom, a teen’s bedroom, by the posters and gaming console. There was a mini fridge in there but before plundering it, I slowly entered, cautious to keep my noise to a minimum. I checked under the bed, in the closet behind the curtains, under the desk, each twice, then opened the mini fridge. There were several mini soda cans and a half eaten frozen pizza. I grabbed a couple slices and slipped a can in my pocket and left the room. I closed the door behind me and moved onto the next doorway, chewing the jerky-like pepperoni. Thankfully this opened to a bathroom. I checked behind the shower curtain and in the linen closet. It was hard to be an atheist the moment I saw that bottle labeled “extra strength.” I grabbed it and took a tablespoon’s worth with the next mouthful of pizza. I know, I didn’t care. All I wanted was relief from my pain. I capped the bottle and put it in my other pocket. 

I left the bathroom and headed for the last doorway. I’m not sure if it was the pizza’s flavor growing on me or the pain killers starting to kick in but I was not as careful and almost committed a fatal blunder. I casually opened the door, as one does in their own bedroom, and was met by the same wreaking stench that proliferated Helen’s office. Looking across the room and over the bed was a man, clad in blood and shit stained clothes, neck craned gawking at the sky through his window. It is only through adrenaline (or divine intervention) that I was able to grab the door before it slammed into the wall on the other side. My breath shortened and I swallowed hard my last bite of pizza. I silently backed out of the room and closed the door. I turned to quickly go down to Amanda but was startled when I saw her approaching me through the hallway. She pointed towards the street and mouthed “They’re right outside.” 

“There’s one in here.” I mouthed back, pointing at the room I just left. Her hands clasped her mouth in astonishment. I looked over her shoulder and breathed, “This way.” I walked past her towards the room with the mini-fridge.

We snuck in and quietly closed the door behind us. Wordlessly we moved the bed and bureau in front of it. Amanda opened the window as we assessed the situation. Through it we could see the roofs of the neighboring houses, their asphalt shingles slick with moisture. We looked down the shaded alleyway in both directions and saw nothing. 

“How do we get down?” I whispered. It wasn’t too far of a drop, but we would certainly make too much noise. Without saying anything she stepped her leg out of the window then, turning, braced herself on the window frame and slowly lowered herself down in a reverse pull-up.

Hanging there she whispered, “Climb down my back, then help me down.” I raised my eyebrows in surprise but began climbing down when I heard the mob on the opposite street collectively moan. I braced myself on Amanda’s shoulders when we heard a loud clash beneath us. Looking down, I saw the soda can I had put in my pocket had fallen out during the climb and fell on a trash can lid, turning it into a symbol.

Amanda glared at me and let go. We crumpled to the ground together as we heard the moaning mob transform into a screeching horde. We bolted, running towards the setting sun, maintaining my original course despite the panic. Darting through alleyways I was able to catch glimpses of the feverish things hunting us. They were barely human anymore. Their skin had turned ashen, grey, and matte. Their eyes were glowing red and I swear I saw their refraction in the windows. We must’ve ran for half an hour when we reached the end of the suburbs. We crested the hill, their cries never ceased. Our tired bodies were getting weak and I didn’t think I could run much farther. 

To my distrusting relief, the hordes stopped just beneath the crest of the hill. Amanda and I stood close, watching the masses before us sway with slavering mouths. The air was tense and we braced for their sudden rush, but none came. Their glowing red eyes held our gaze. We jumped when, in unison, every single one of them broke their neck to look upwards at the sky. The collective crunch of spinal columns sounded like the Earth’s crust being folded in half. Following their line of sight, I turned to see something which I still don’t fully believe. 

Emerging from the turbulent clouds above was a gargantuan; a stinking piece of oblivion slipping its way into our reality from the realm of human nightmares. Its many, lidless eyes beamed downwards at us with an authority that only beings who do not die possess. I cowered in fear, uncaring of anything surrounding me. All of my consciousness was occupied trying to make sense of the insane. My migraines were put to shame, for the boiling in my brain built pressure in my head so that my nose bled and my eyes watered. Further this thing came through its veil of darkness, revealing more of its grotesqueness. It possessed no solid form; only writhing tentacles, swirling impossibly, encompassing those horrible eyes. 

My eyelids were locked open as the embodiment of the void stared at me. I could not move or look away. Within my frozen faculties I felt the command to “Kneel.”

I honestly can’t remember much about what happened after that. But between Amanda and myself, we’ve pieced together some of what did. As its command echoed forth in the minds of the mob, they kneeled, like penitent believers. Amanda tells me that she grabbed my hand and dragged me away, the enormous atrocity apparently disinterested in a couple of mortals escaping. She pulled me through the woods and hills, running for hours. With enough distance, our headaches relented and we were free of the infected and their monstrous master. Despite our respite, it was clear its reach was deep. Throughout the countryside, the forests, and fields, we saw the dead and the swath its followers had carved. It was months before we found others like us; others who didn’t succumb. There’s twenty-four of us now and we’ve made a base, so to speak. We haven’t seen a swarm of infected in a few days. 

I think we’re safe for now but…someone just started passing around the pain killers.
