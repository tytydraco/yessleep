I’ve never been bright by academic standards. Maths and Science are aspects I’d generally consider out of my realm of understanding. Still, when it comes down to livestock and day-to-day duties as a farm hand I’d say I’m just about average. It’s not that I’m stupid by any stretch of the word, it’s just that I understand and learn what I like, and I find it difficult to provide my attention to anything that doesn’t give me the slightest bit of excitement. Regardless, I don’t need to be all that bright to know the animals around here aren’t normal.

 

I work for an elderly man called Mr Cropper whose family has owned and worked on the farm for several generations. If it wasn’t for the fact that Mr Cropper's youngest son George didn’t lose his leg in a combine harvester a few years back, then I wouldn’t be here at all. The farm has always been a birthright to the children of the Cropper family and has always been an expectation that everyone would take their place working there. However, on the account of Mr Cropper's late wife, he hasn’t had the heart to move on and so he has been left a worker and a half down on the account a one-legged man can’t be consistently agile every single day. Without a qualification to my name and no one else applying I soon became the newly appointed farmhand to the Cropper family legacy. Although I don’t exactly live on the farm, at least not with everyone else. I live around 10 km away from where the Croppers live in a small cobblestone cottage that used to belong to Mr Cropper's grandmother who was so fond of the nearby pond she wished to see the morning glow dance across its tiny waves every day. I don’t mind living this far out from the rest. Despite the cottage being a little rundown and nail-bitingly cold in the winter months, the way the sun shines across that pond is nothing more than breathtaking. However, I can’t help but think that Mr Cropper has me live this far out because my presence serves as a reminder of the trauma that led to my arrival. I don’t blame him. This farm has always and will always belong to the Croppers.

 

My duties on the farm vary depending on the season. In the colder months, I’m needed for the early lambing season, springtime is when I’m needed for planting, summer harvesting, and so on. However, the duty that I hate the most purely because it’s the most tedious is tracking down escaped livestock and repairing the walls they’ve destroyed when climbing over. Segments of the farm are separated by walls made from loose rock stacked on top of one another. Some of the walls are as old as my cottage if not older and have remained a farm tradition. As livestock such as sheep climb over, they scatter the rock demolishing sections of the wall providing a useful yet annoying sign as to where they're headed. It’s not only annoying that once I’ve found the animal I then must rebuild the wall, but it's also annoying the fact that most sheep who do this end up injuring or breaking their leg during their fall down the other side.

 

Late October last year I had met up with George to help herd the sheep into the barn in preparation for lambing season. Climbing the slippery hill, the sun far behind the clouds the whole field was cast in a dim mist with George propped against his crutch at the top whistling as his sheepdog Felix ran circles around the sheep appearing as a white flash disappearing and reappearing in the grass.

 

“How’s the leg, George?”

“Still missing. How’s that pillow back at yours Sam? Still treating her right?”

“Leave it out will ya-“

“Listen the day I see you with a girl is the day you can come live with us. Be nice to have someone fairer on the eyes than your ugly mug.”

“Don’t see you getting any action”

George grimaced a smile and cast his eyes back over to the sheep now filtering through the gate to the next field.

“Missing a sheep.”

“Doesn’t look to be any damage to the wall”

“Well, it looks like we're down to 32 and the last anyone checked we had 33.”

“Don’t exactly have anything to go off. I’ll see what I can do. Can’t guarantee I’ll find her before sundown.”

“Don’t have a choice, Sammy. Lass is pregnant, can’t have her freezing out there now.”

 

I can’t begin to describe how far and wide I looked. The further I ventured through the field and some of our more wooded areas I didn’t even glimpse so much as a strand of white wool. Every hour the mist grew thicker and thicker to the point I could only see a couple of feet in front of me, and by the time the sun had set I came to the realisation that I had completed a full circle before returning to the edge of my cottage pond. My hands were completely numb, and my nose leaked a constant stream of snot as I stumbled with half paralysed legs to my cottage door and collapsed in a chair by the fireplace. My cottage isn’t as dated as you’d believe. I do in fact get electricity all the way out here and a tiny bit of signal, but both George and his father swear against technology and refuse to use anything other than a landline which each farm building has, besides the barn where George would likely be. Regardless I rang their home phone to let them know I couldn’t find the sheep and was turning in for the night due to the mist limiting my vision from reaching the barn. There was no answer. I rang three more times and was again met with a recording of Mr Cropper and his wife.

 

“Thank you for calling the Cropper farm, unfortunately, my husband and his dashing drop-dead gorgeous- “

“I don’t know about drop dead!”

“Oh shut up Henry! You know I’d never change a hair on your head, and I know if I didn’t look this good, you’d be down at the pub each night looking for a mistress.”

“I wouldn’t trade you for the world.”

 

That’s where the recording ends. I don’t think Mr Cropper knows he still has it set, and I don’t feel like reminding him. I just hoped they’d understand my absence and by any rate, the sheep had likely miscarried from the stress they’d endured so far from the herd and with all this mist. There isn’t much out there that would kill it. Living in England we don’t get any wolves or bears but we do have foxes and badgers, and I don’t think either would be able to take down a sheep unless it was incredibly weak which at that stage it wouldn’t be the fox putting it out of its misery.

 

I don’t exactly know how late into the night it was. I was in my pyjamas already in bed and on the verge of entering sleep when echoing in the distance was a single rhythmic “Baa!”. I sat up in bed and peered out my window to a moonlit pond with gentle ripples crashing against the bank and yet the sound was there. Constant. The same tone, melody, and pitch over and over again. It didn’t exactly sound like it was in pain. Calmer and softer than that. Judging from the sound there was a possibility the baby would survive as long as I managed to herd her into my cottage and keep her warm. Still, in my pyjamas I slid on my boots and jacket and wandered out into the mist with a torch in hand. I first heard her baa come from the left and started in that direction stumbling over roots and caking my trousers in mud as I’d slip on the grass. Then the Baa came from the right even further than the one before. Picking up the pace I darted to the right the beam of my torch lighting the way through entangled branches before again hearing the baa coming from the direction of my cottage. Reaching my cottage once again, the beam of my torch reflected two bright eyes staring at me amidst the dark. “Baa!”. I crept towards her taking care not to step on a branch or spook her in the slightest let I restart our game of cat and mouse. She didn’t move, however. She remained motionless even. Staring unblinking all the way up to the point I could reach out and touch her.

 

“Baa!”

“How about we get you inside Miss?”

 

I softly spoke giving her a little push towards my cottage door. The force of her stance was like trying to push a brick wall as she remained unmoved by my efforts. That’s when I noticed her eyes more closely. Usually, when you shine light into a pupil they shrink but hers didn’t. They didn’t change at all in fact. Her hooves were clean, with no marks or injuries and her wool was bright white without so much as a spec of dirt. Crouching down to become level with her eyes she remained completely still, her eyes felt as if they looked completely through me to something far, far beyond. Feeling the first drops of rain I didn’t want to waste any more time and cupped my hands beneath her and heaved her into my arms and carried her indoors setting her down beside the fire. It was like carrying a ton, there was no wonder she didn’t move if that was the burden she had been carrying.

 

I sat with her for a little while. She remained standing, still unblinking, staring into the fire. She didn’t exactly scare me at first. Yeah, she was unnerving but so are a lot of the animals on the farm. Some sheep have eyes that look entirely human. Some cows moo so strangely that it sounds as if they are saying “you” over and over again. On a daily basis, you’ll feel the sudden urge as if you're being watched to then turn around and find every animal in the field staring directly at you. This felt like one of those instances. I was entirely wrong.

 

“Well then Miss I’m going to turn in for the night, if you need anything just let me know.”

 

Quickly patting her, her head felt rough. Almost as if there was something beneath her skin. I crouched down eye level with her once again. Her pupils never did shrink. Placing my hand steady on the top of her head I felt a wave of gentle uneven pulsing. Looking more closely I noticed it wasn’t just her head, but her whole body was covered in rhythmic pulsing buried beneath. Outside seemed to fall completely silent besides the soft crackle of the fireplace leaving another sound. A soft buzzing sound. I positioned my ear closer beside the Sheep’s head and heard what was unmistakably the sound of hordes of insects. My heart sank at the realisation as I stood back up and stared back down at the sheep who seemed unbothered by the fact she was a bustling nest and on the verge of exploding.

 

I darted over to the landline dialling over and over again the voice of Mrs Cropper taunting me on the other end. I wasn’t trained for something like this.

 

“Baa!”

 

Spinning on my heel the sheep turned completely around and was now staring at me. Her eyes. They were unexplainable. They never moved, never dilated, never dried or went bloodshot. It was as if they weren’t real. Imitations of eyes with blinking  a foreign concept. In an instant, she let out a long agonising.

 

“Baaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”

 

A pile of flies and ants splattered between her legs with a loud squelch. Rolling off their backs and wiping their antennas clean they burrowed beneath my floorboards leaving me reeling as to whether I had imagined it. The piercing ring of the landline cut through the air as I clutched the receiver within an instant.

 

“Sammy it's George, listen I can't talk long but all of the sheep have escaped the barn. I’m going out to look for them now with Dad and Felix, but if you find them you bring them straight to the barn as best you can, okay?”

 

The call ended before I could even answer. My heart raced; this was a complete disaster. If the sheep were out of the barn for more than a couple hours with it being so cold, it could result in serious consequences with their pregnancy. Stepping backwards towards the door I never left my eyes off the sheep silhouetted by my fireplace. Swinging the door open and casting my foot across the threshold of my cottage I froze in an instant. Stood, all unblinking, were the rest of the sheep surrounding me.

 

“What do you want!?”

 

My mind went completely blank. My palms were slick with sweat and my body shaking sending the torch in all directions as tens of eyes reflected back at me from within the dark abyss. Invading the night air I was suddenly overcome with a powerful stench I knew all too well. The smell of birth. The sound of buzzing insects surged in harmony with the monotone Baas of the sheep both within and outside. Slowly turning around to face the fire the sheep approached the door and pushed past my leg to rejoin the herd. The walls of the cottage were covered in roaches and ants with numerous fluttering moths and flies bashing against the lights and those too adventurous erupting into glowing embers as they neared the fireplace. Within the centre of the room, curled up lay a bloodied sack. Absent of limbs or a face the slug-like creature lay motionless in its mother’s blood. In a jumble of clattering hooves, the sheep had all but gone by now. I approached the centre cupping the creature in my hands and wandered outside towards the edge of the pond. It was dead. I didn’t know what it was or what exactly I had witnessed that night, but I just about knew it was dead. With my hands, I scooped handfuls of dirt and buried the creature beneath the earth. I removed the cross hung around my neck and placed it atop the grave. I didn’t know what to think but my empathy remained.

 

The following morning I discovered the grave empty, and the cross tossed aside. Abandoned by its herd and God, I believe it still roams the farm. When I returned to the barn, I found George propped up on his crutch patting me on the back as all 33 sheep stared right at us from within. I don’t exactly know what happened that night but there are times when the owls and crickets fall silent and if you listen close enough, you’ll hear the gurgled baa that echoes still from that night.
