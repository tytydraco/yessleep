Right now I'm hiding in my washing machine (yes, I know that's weird), but I think this is the best hiding spot since no one will find me here. Let me tell you my story. 

I am a math teacher in a primary school. I've been teaching for 5 years. This year, I'm teaching the first grade students. Being kids, they like to have fun and they are loud. But I thought that teaching first grade is better than teaching the misbehaving fifth grade kids. 

Teaching first grade kids is never boring. Sure, the material is boring, but the kids aren't. They are the most eager to learn. They are always excited about learning math and it makes me happy. We learned math through games and fun, fuck worksheets. Students hate doing it and I hate grading it. 

One day, when I was preparing my things to go to school, I heard my back door open. I knew it was my back door because it makes a distinct creaking noise when it opens. Being scared, I ran to the school. The day went by normally but I was still scared. After I finished teaching, I called the police to investigate my house. No signs of an intruder or a break-in was found, so they left. I thought the back door opening is just due to it being old. 

During the night I couldn't sleep. I felt that I was constantly watched from above. I kept hearing occasional taps on my window. Every time I tried to close my eyes, I felt like another pair of eyes stared back at me from the darkness. I was covered in sweat and my heart was beating like crazy. I finally fell asleep at 3 AM. 

I went to school the next day, not letting my fears get in the way of teaching. Class was running smoothly until a student said, "Miss, there's someone behind you, is he your friend?" I turned around and saw nobody. I was confused and asked the kid, "Is there someone behind my back?" The whole class said yes. I thought it was a joke and continued teaching. Some kids keep telling me there's someone behind my back, but I ignored it and eventually the school day ends and I went home. 

During the way back home, I heard footsteps following me. When I looked back, they stopped. I got scared and basically sprinted home. When I arrived at my home, I locked all my doors and read a book to get this thing off my mind. I managed to make a cup of tea and thought maybe it was just sleep deprivation. I still feel scared, though. 

When I was about to take my last sip of tea, the sound of a window breaking caught my attention. It was the window next to my room. I peeped and saw the creature that had been following me. It is human-shaped, colored pitch-black with white glowing eyes. I realized that this creature must be the one that the children saw. I ran to the room closest to me, the cleaning room, and hid inside the washing machine. 

Thankfully, I brought my phone, so I could monitor the creature from my cameras. I noticed that as it got closer and closer to me, its eyes turned red, than gradually turned white again as it leaves my area. Another thing that I've noticed, was that the more scared I am, the creature became faster and closer to me.  This means that I'll have to stay calm. Lastly, the creature has a great hearing. When one of my books fell off my bookshelf, the creature ran to the room, even if it's on the opposite side of the house.

I think I got a plan to escape this creature. I'll put my phone on silent and call 911. I'll keep the call muted and the responders will eventually track where I am and send help. I'll just need to survive until help arrives. 

For all the teachers out there - listen to your students. It might save your life.
