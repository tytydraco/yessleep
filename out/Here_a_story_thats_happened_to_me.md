I'm concerned for my friend. Recently, I found him playing a game called "Your Bizarre Adventure", or YBA for short. Ever since then, his behavior has changed drastically. When he got bullied in school, he would shout out 'RKer', and then when he fought back, he would start saying the word 'ez', 'trash' and 'garbage' over and over for the next 5 minutes as he kicks the guy around. When the bullies friends came in, he asked me to help him 'Stop the teamers'. I didn't understand what that meant, but I had the help of the teacher instead. He then called me a 'runner'.

Another incident occurred where my class went to a field trip. As we were exploring the Egyptian area, my friend went to the Egyptian Weapons section and grabbed an old arrow. He then stabbed himself, and said 'Whitesnake please' over and over. When he pulled the arrow out, he shouted 'Ew, Beach Boy' and began to ask 'Roka fruit please', even though I had no idea what that was. The museum staff had to pull the Relic away from him, and then he screamed while bleeding 'TEAMERS' over and over. I have no idea how his pain tolerance is suddenly so high.

The final incident I wish to talk about is at my Grandfather's Grave. As I was making my weekly trip there to pay my respects, my friend asked me if I had any fruits. I was curious as to what he meant, but I gave him an apple in response. He then threw it onto the ground, and said 'I want roka.' Then, he started digging the grave of some random person in the graveyard behind my grandfather's, and then pulled out the dead person's rib while saying 'D4C please'. After trying to shove the ribcage into his own, he dropped it and said 'Yooo, D4She, let's go!'. Then he asked me for a heart, but I told him I didn't have one. He found some random squirrel, and started killing it with a rock. He then pulled out its heart and, again, shoved it onto himself. He then shouted 'Now I need Hamon'.  


  
I was frightened by his strange behavior and I didn't know what to do. I tried to talk to him about it but he just ignored me and walked away. I tried to seek help from professionals, but they didn't seem to understand what was happening to him. The strange incidents continued to happen, and I was worried for my friend's well-being. One day, I decided to do some research on YBA and I found out that it was a virtual reality game that had taken over my friend's life. The game was notorious for causing players to behave strangely and even become addicted to it.

I was determined to help my friend, so I entered the game with him to see what was going on. What I found was a virtual world filled with dangerous creatures and powerful beings, and my friend was caught in the middle of it all. He had become so immersed in the game that he could no longer tell the difference between reality and fantasy. I tried to help him get out of the game, but he was too deep in to listen.

Eventually, I found a way to disconnect him from the game, but it was too late. The damage had already been done. He was in a coma for weeks, and when he finally woke up, he was a completely different person. He had no memory of his time in the game or the strange incidents that happened. I was relieved that he was safe, but I was also sad that he had lost a part of himself.

From that day on, I made it my mission to warn others about the dangers of virtual reality games like YBA. I spread the word and helped people understand the harm they can cause, hoping to prevent others from going through the same thing as my friend.  
Despite my efforts to spread awareness about the dangers of YBA, there were still people who refused to listen. They were drawn to the game's excitement and thrill, just like my friend once was. I tried to reach out to them, but they wouldn't listen. I even tried to talk to the creators of the game, but they brushed me off and told me that they had taken all the necessary precautions to ensure player safety.

I was frustrated and didn't know what to do, until I met a group of people who had also been affected by virtual reality games. We formed a support group and started to help each other heal from our experiences. Together, we tried to raise awareness about the dangers of these games and pressured the creators to make changes.

We organized rallies and protests, and even staged a sit-in at the headquarters of the company that created YBA. Our voices were finally heard, and the game was eventually taken off the market. The creators were held accountable for their actions and were forced to pay compensation to the families of those who had suffered as a result of their game.

Although we couldn't turn back time and undo the harm that had been done, we were proud of what we had accomplished. Our efforts had helped to prevent others from falling into the same trap as my friend and many others. I learned that together, we can make a difference and create change for the better. and this was my story
