She was there, when I came to my senses again, standing over me. The girl from the cemetery, the girl from the cafe. My headache was gone, and I was still lying on the pavement. I could not comprehend what was going on, but she was talking to another lady, helped me up, I was now lying in an icy and sticky puddle of blood. She held me as I staggered away with her, while the lady kept insisting to herself that I would need an ambulance.

We did not speak a word while we walked, and she held me close to her. My head felt so much better, even good. The cold left my bones, as comfortable warmth was radiating from my skull. My heart felt paralyzed with fear, but also like I could not physically try to get away from her. If you have ever experienced sleep paralysis, this is the precise sensation. My body was walking mechanically, I did not feel any pain, just a kind of blissful feeling in the front of my head, but still extreme unease, fear, and the urge to break free and run as fast and far as I could.

I could not make out where we were going. I remember walking with her, and I would have recognized the streets and buildings, but in the moment, nothing seemed to be able to penetrate my panicked, blissful paralysis.

She brought me to a ground-floor apartment, she undressed me, laid me in a bathtub, and washed my naked body with dish soap and the soft end of a kitchen sponge. I must have fallen asleep or passed out.

Nonci ta qaa.

I woke up again, wrapped in a thin white cotton cloth, unable to move. I must have slept. It smelled of incense. I turned my head to look at the room I found myself in. The windows were covered with book pages; it must have been day outside, not sunny, but daylight penetrated the paper and gave everything a beige shade. The furniture was woody and dark, probably very old. Some pieces of furniture were covered in similar white cloth, as I was wrapped in. I heard voices from the next room, but I could not make out any words.

Nonci ta qaa.

I could almost hear it, as if it were spoken from inside my head. The word Mordeshu crossed my mind, and it felt … it feels so silly to say this, but it is the only way I can describe it, like a little orgasm in my head, to think this word.

I tried to listen to the words that were spoken, while I could not loosen myself from the tight cotton wrap I had been made into. Realizing that I did not understand anything apart from some words and snippets of conversation, “Frater”, “came back”, “unable to run away”, I finally made out “botched”, which silenced the conversation in the next room. I involuntarily started to wiggle like a worm, partly to free myself, partly because I felt like my body was cramping up. The girl looked inside the room. Her black hair framed her pale face; she was wearing a black hoodie and jeans. Her face was expressionless, her black eyes staring at me, as if I were some kind of mistake that she did not quite know what to do with at this point, her black lips seeming to whisper something to herself only. To her, I was a problem that a solution needed to be found for.

Her head disappeared again in the door frame.

After some further discussion, more heated but less intelligible to me, I heard a door and steps moving outside. My head started hurting again, my face feeling feverish, in an intense spike, until the door creaked again after what felt like at least half an hour. I did not dare to scream. Almost involuntarily, I said “help”. Not like someone who means it. 

I came to myself to the beat of some goth dance music. I was still wrapped in cotton, and for a moment, I could not tell if it was sleep paralysis again or if I was just wrapped too tightly to move. Engulfed in darkness, I could barely see, apart from some green flickering light. The girl was dancing around the room, obviously not noticing that I had woken up. It was kind of bizarre to watch until she stopped in the middle of the song. She stopped directly in my view, facing towards one of the walls. She turned around, and I instinctively closed my eyes, but clearly saw her, see me. I heard her shrill laugh, in a burst, and immediately stopped. I opened my eyes again and saw her face directly in front of mine. I could feel her breath on my face. She laughed again and put her hand through my hair.

I dropped in and out of consciousness a few more times after that. There were episodes of her feeding me with a little spoon from a cup. Her lying with me, embracing me from behind. Her skin feeling obscenely good against me. More dancing. 

It felt like I woke up in the middle of a conversation, in the middle of a sentence, which I stopped, confused. She looked at me. “There you are”, it was the first time I heard her speak to me directly. She began telling me the craziest story.
