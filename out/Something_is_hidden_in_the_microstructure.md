Writing this is the last thing left to do.

I had a friend, Jim. We met in college. He was one of those people who lit up every room he walked into, the kind of guy who had a story for every situation and could make anyone laugh. If life were a party, Jim was the host. And me? I was the quiet one, the guy sitting in the corner, fiddling with a chessboard or trying to finish a book while the noise of the world carried on around me.

It didn’t seem like we’d have much in common, but we clicked. Both of us were studying materials engineering, and we started pairing up for everything: group projects, lab assignments, late-night study sessions. He’d bring the energy, I’d bring the focus. He joked that he couldn’t have made it through thermodynamics without me. I told him I’d probably still be stuck in first-year physics without him.

After graduation, our paths diverged. I went straight into research—academic work, mostly. I didn’t mind scraping by on scholarships because I loved what I was doing. There’s something about studying metals, about peeling back the layers of their microstructures and uncovering their secrets, that made me feel... grounded. Jim, on the other hand, went into industry. He had this way of talking to people, of leading them, that made him perfect for managing teams. He climbed the corporate ladder faster than anyone I knew.

We stayed close, though. Even after he started making six figures and jetting off to board meetings in London or Tokyo, we always found time to catch up. He’d call me from wherever he was—some swanky hotel room or a café in Paris—just to hear about whatever creep test or metallographic study I was working on.

It became a tradition: every time Jim traveled somewhere new, he’d bring me back a piece of metal. He had this thing for archaeology, and his finds were always fascinating. Arrowheads, ancient coins, fragments of tools—each one was like a little puzzle waiting to be solved. I’d spend days analyzing them, figuring out their composition, their microstructure, their history. We even co-authored a few papers on the artifacts.

Jim loved traveling. He loved the freedom, the adventure. I think part of him enjoyed the idea that he could do his job from anywhere while the rest of us were stuck in labs or offices. He’d joke about it all the time: “Man, you should try it. A laptop, a strong Wi-Fi signal, and the world’s your office.” I’d laugh it off, telling him I was happier staring down a microscope than wandering through ancient ruins.

But he always brought me something. That was Jim—he knew how much I loved the work. And every time he came back, he’d hand me a new artifact with that grin of his and say, “This one’s gonna blow your mind.”

I didn’t know how right he was.

It was a Friday night when Jim handed me the statue. We’d agreed to meet at this Brazilian churrascaria we both loved. Jim had just gotten back from Iraq—another one of his “spontaneous archaeology trips,” as he called them. He seemed different this time, though. Tired. Maybe even a little on edge.

I noticed it as soon as he sat down. Jim was usually the loudest guy in the room, but that night, he barely touched his food. Instead, he kept fiddling with his bag, glancing at it like he was worried it might get up and walk away.

“You okay?” I asked, cutting into a piece of picanha.

“Yeah,” he said, too quickly. “I’ve got something for you.”

He reached into the bag and pulled out a small, fabric-wrapped bundle. The material was dirty, frayed at the edges, like it had been through hell. He placed it on the table between us, nodding for me to open it.

“What is it?”

“Just open it,” he said, leaning back in his chair.

I unwrapped the bundle carefully, revealing a small statue about five centimeters tall. It was uncanny. At first glance, it looked like a crude humanoid figure, but the proportions were all wrong. The arms were too long, the head had strange protrusions, and the face was featureless, just a smooth, rounded surface.

“What is this?” I asked, turning it over in my hands.

“Something I picked up in a cave,” Jim said. He didn’t meet my eyes. “Don’t ask me where exactly. Let’s just say I had to borrow it.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Borrow?”

He grinned, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Yeah, well, the group I was with wasn’t too keen on people taking souvenirs. Figured I’d keep this one for you.”

I studied the statue more closely. It was made of metal—steel, if I had to guess—but it didn’t look old. The surface was too smooth, too perfect. I’d analyzed plenty of ancient artifacts in my time, and none of them looked like this.

“This doesn’t feel ancient,” I said.

Jim shrugged. “Beats me. All I know is, it was buried deep in the wall of a cave. Took me half an hour to dig it out. Thought you’d like the challenge.”

There was something in his voice I couldn’t quite place—something between pride and unease.

“Challenge accepted,” I said, tucking the statue back into the fabric. “I’ll let you know what I find.”

Jim nodded, but he didn’t look relieved. If anything, he looked more tense. “I’m heading to Africa tomorrow,” he said abruptly. “Figured I’d drop this off before I go.”

“Another adventure?”

“Something like that.” He paused, his eyes flicking to the bundle in my hands. “Be careful with that thing, okay?”

I laughed. “What’s the worst that could happen? It’s just a piece of metal.”

Jim didn’t laugh.

The statue sat on my desk for a couple of weeks. December is always busy for me—wrapping up research projects, finalizing papers, and trying to get everything done before the holidays. But one Friday, I finally decided to take a closer look.

I remember unwrapping it and placing it under the bright lab lights. There was something oddly mesmerizing about it. Its surface was unnervingly smooth, almost unnatural for a metal artifact.

I started with the basics: metallography. The first step was cutting a small sample from the base. Normally, I’d feel guilty about damaging an artifact, but Jim had called this a “challenge,” and I was eager to figure it out.

When I polished the sample and put it under the microscope, I was stunned. The microstructure was immaculate. It was steel, no doubt about that, but the grains were so uniform, so perfect, that it looked like something forged in a high-tech lab, not dug out of a cave.

At first, I thought it might be modern. Maybe Jim had been duped by a replica or some kind of hoax. But then I noticed the inclusions. They didn’t match anything I’d seen before—not carbon, not manganese. They were strange, dark precipitates scattered throughout the structure, almost like... cracks. But when I tried to zoom in closer, they seemed to shift, as if the sample itself was resisting analysis.

That should’ve been my first warning.

Still, I was intrigued. I decided to test its mechanical properties. The creep test was the next logical step—a way to measure the material’s behavior under extreme heat and stress. I machined a specimen out of the statue and set up the test: 600°C, 125 MPa. For a steel like this, I figured it would take about 12 hours to fail.

It was late, and I was tired, so I started the test and left it running over the weekend. These machines are designed to shut off automatically once the sample fractures, so I didn’t think twice about heading home.

Before I left, though, I glanced at the statue’s remains on my desk. Even without the piece I’d cut away, it looked... whole, as if it hadn’t been altered at all. For a second, I thought I saw something shift in the reflection—a flicker of shadow across its smooth surface.

I shook it off. It had been a long day.

Saturday morning started like any other. I was eating breakfast—black coffee and toast—when my phone rang. It was the university. That wasn’t unusual; labs sometimes needed maintenance, or there’d be a problem with equipment. But the voice on the other end wasn’t calm or routine—it was panicked.

“You need to get here. Now,” the security guard said.

“Why? What’s going on?”

“It’s your lab. Something smells horrible. We can’t even go inside. You need to come check it out.”

At first, I thought it might be a sewer issue or maybe a chemical spill, but when I arrived on campus, I knew it wasn’t that simple. The smell hit me the moment I stepped out of my car. It wasn’t just bad—it was *putrid*.

The security guard was waiting for me outside the building, his face pale, a makeshift mask of shirts wrapped around his nose and mouth. “It’s coming from your lab,” he said, his voice muffled. “We can’t get near it.”

As I approached the lab, the stench grew worse. It was unlike anything I’d ever smelled—decay, sulfur, rot, and something metallic, like blood. My stomach churned, and I gagged, barely managing to keep my breakfast down.

I covered my face with my scarf and forced myself to open the lab door. The air inside was thick, oppressive, and the smell was suffocating. It clung to my skin, my clothes, my lungs. I couldn’t take more than a few steps before I had to run back out, gasping for fresh air.

“What the hell could cause that?” the guard asked, his voice trembling.

“I don’t know,” I muttered, trying to steady myself. “I need to figure it out.”

The second time, I held my breath as I stepped into the lab. The smell seemed to seep into my brain, making it hard to think, but I managed to trace its source: the creep test machine.

The furnace was still running, the sample glowing red inside. I shut the machine off, and the hum of the equipment died away, leaving an eerie silence. The stench began to lessen, but only slightly.

I stood there for a moment, staring at the machine, trying to understand what I was looking at. The sample hadn’t deformed. It hadn’t fractured. It was completely intact, as if it hadn’t been under stress at all.

That didn’t make sense. At those temperatures, at that tension, the steel should’ve elongated, warped, broken apart. But it looked exactly the same as when I’d placed it inside.

And the smell—it didn’t fade entirely. It lingered in the room, thick and unnatural, as if the air itself had been tainted.

I left the lab, locking the door behind me. My head was spinning, my stomach churning. Whatever was happening, it wasn’t normal. It wasn’t *scientific*.

That night, the stench clung to me. No matter how many times I showered, I could still smell it—faint, but there. Like it had worked its way into my skin.

I barely slept. When I did, the dreams came.

At first, it was just fire. Endless waves of it, roaring and consuming everything in its path. Then came the shadows, always on the corner of my eye, like they were avoiding me. And then the voice.

It was a voice just like myself, but just different enough for it to be seen as a mockery. It whispered my name, over and over, drawing it out like a chant. It told me things I didn’t want to hear. “You’ve touched it now,” it said. “You’ve begun the work. Finish it.”

I woke up drenched in sweat, the faint scent of sulfur and rotting meat lingering in my room. My hands were shaking as I reached for the glass of water on my nightstand.

It was just a dream, I told myself. Stress from the lab. But when I went back to bed, the whispers didn’t stop.

The next morning, I arrived at the lab determined to find answers. The smell had lessened but hadn’t disappeared entirely. It was weaker now, more like a faint warning than an all-consuming assault.

The creep test machine sat in the corner, cold and silent. The sample lay on the workbench where I’d left it, unchanged. But as I stared at it, I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was watching me.

I brushed the thought aside and decided to run more tests. I measured its hardness, its density, its thermal properties. Each result was normal for steel, at least. But when I placed the sample under the microscope again, I noticed something new.

The inclusions—the strange, dark precipitates I’d seen before—they had shifted. They were no longer scattered randomly. They had formed a pattern.

I pulled back from the microscope, my pulse pounding. It wasn’t possible. Metallurgy doesn’t work like that. Crystalline structures don’t just rearrange themselves under ambient temperature.

I tried to convince myself it was an illusion, a trick of the light, but the symbols were too precise, too deliberate. Maybe I was too tired. 

The whispers started again that night. They didn’t wait for me to fall asleep this time. I heard them as I sat at my desk, trying to write up my findings.

“Finish it,” the voice said.

The shadows in the corners of the room seemed darker than they should’ve been. The air felt heavy, oppressive, like the walls were closing in.

I closed my laptop and went to bed, hoping the nightmares wouldn’t follow me.

They did.

This time, the shadows weren’t just watching, they were moving, I could see more of them. And the voice wasn’t whispering anymore. It was laughing.

When I woke up, my notebook was on the floor. The pages were filled with symbols I didn’t recognize.

By Monday morning, I was already on edge. The dreams, the whispers, the symbols in my notebook—it all felt like it was spiraling out of control. But I told myself I could figure it out. That’s what I do—I solve problems. I analyze.

I was about to head to the lab when my phone buzzed. A text.

It was from Jim.

*“Don’t trust it. I’m sorry.”*

I stared at the screen, my stomach sinking. Jim never joked about things like this. 

I called him several times but there was no answer.

I spent several hours reaching out to Jim’s sister, as she always knew where he was. But she didn’t picked up either.

After all afternoon she finally picked up, in tears.

*“Hey, just for you to know. He called me before he did it. Did he say something to you?”*

*She went on and on about how he just killed himself in his hotel room.*

The words didn’t make sense at first. I had just seen him a few days ago, handing me that damned statue with his usual grin. Jim couldn’t be dead.

Jim had been found by the hotel staff in his room. The report called it a suicide, but the details didn’t add up.

“There were claw marks on the walls,” his sister said, her voice shaking. “Like he’d been trying to fight something off. And the bed... there were scorch marks all around it. The hotel employees said his body was burned, but only his eyes. It’s like they were... charred from the inside out.”

I hung up without saying goodbye. My hands were trembling, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps.

Jim’s last text echoed in my mind: *Don’t trust it.*

I knew I should have left the lab right then and there. I should have smashed that statue into a million pieces and thrown the dust into the ocean. But instead, I went back to the lab.

The smell hit me as soon as I walked in. It wasn’t as strong as before, but it was still there, lingering like a ghost.

I sat at my desk, staring at the statue. Jim’s warning played over and over in my head. *Don’t trust it.* But I couldn’t stop myself. I had to understand it.

I picked up the statue, feeling the cold, smooth surface against my skin. It felt heavier than it should have, like it was pulling me down.

That night, the dreams were worse than ever. The shadows weren’t just watching anymore—they were touching me, clawing at my skin, whispering things I couldn’t understand. The voice wasn’t a whisper anymore; it was trying to be charming, trying to seduce me.

*“Finish the work.”*

I woke up screaming, my hands covered in sweat. The statue was on my nightstand, even though I’d left it in the lab.

I didn’t take the statue back to the lab the next morning. I couldn’t bring myself to touch it again. It just sat there on my nightstand, cold and immovable, like a dead weight pulling the room down with it.

But I couldn’t leave it alone. I had to know more.

I started digging into the region where Jim had found it. The statue wasn’t from any culture I recognized, but the area he’d mentioned had a history steeped in myths—stories of ancient civilizations that rose to incredible power before disappearing overnight.

One legend stood out. It spoke of a pact between a god of fire and destruction and a forgotten kingdom. The god had gifted them material  in exchange for their devotion. At first, they used it to build weapons, tools, art. But the more they worked with it, the more it demanded.

The legend claimed the civilization was wiped out. Their city burned, their people went mad.

I didn’t want to believe it. It sounded like a fairy tale, the kind of story locals tell to scare tourists. 

I went back to the lab that night. I don’t know what I was hoping to find, but I knew I couldn’t stay away. The lab was silent, but the moment I opened the door, the air seemed heavier, thicker.

The statue wasn’t there—it was still on my nightstand—but its presence lingered, like a shadow burned into the walls.

The whispers started again as I worked, faint at first, like the hum of a machine. But they grew louder, more insistent.

*“Finish it.”*

I don’t remember how long I stayed in the lab that night. When I finally looked up, hours had passed. My hands were covered in sweat again, and the notebook in front of me was filled with pages and pages of symbols I didn’t remember writing.

The dreams that night weren’t dreams anymore. They felt real. I was in a burning city, the air thick with ash and screams. Shadows moved all around me, their skinny and charred hands reaching out, trying to pull me deeper into the fire.

And the voice—it wasn’t just calling my name now. It was laughing.

When I woke up, the statue was back on my desk. I hadn’t brought it from my apartment.

I had to go back.

When I arrived at the lab that morning, the statue was sitting on the workbench, right where the creep test machine had been. I didn’t question how it got there. At this point, nothing about it surprised me anymore.

The smell was back, stronger than ever. It wasn’t just the sulfuric rot this time—it was mixed with something acrid, metallic, and burning. I gagged as I stepped inside, but I couldn’t bring myself to leave.

The whispers started as soon as I closed the door.

*“Finish it.”*

The symbols I’d been writing were everywhere now—on my notebooks, on loose papers, scrawled on the whiteboard in my own handwriting. I didn’t remember writing them, but they were so familiar.

I decided to test the statue again. I didn’t know why, maybe it was the voice, maybe it was my own obsession, but I needed to know what would happen.

This time, I didn’t cut a sample. I placed the entire statue into the furnace and turned the temperature up as high as it would go. The lab was silent except for the hum of the machine and the faint crackling of the furnace.

And then I saw it.

The statue didn’t melt. It didn’t deform. Instead, it began to glow, a deep, pulsing red that filled the room with an eerie light. The whispers grew louder, drowning out everything else, until they weren’t whispers anymore—they were screams.

The air in the lab turned heavy, almost liquid. I could feel it pressing down on me, suffocating me, filling my lungs with that sulfuric stench. The shadows on the walls began to move, twisting and writhing like they were alive.

The furnace shut itself off, and the glow faded. But the screams didn’t stop.

I opened the furnace door, and the statue was different. Its surface was no longer smooth. It was covered in deep, jagged grooves. And the symbols—they were etched into the metal now, glowing faintly with a orange glow, like it was still red-hot.

That’s when the voice spoke again, louder and clearer than ever.

*“Finish the work.”*

I ran. I don’t remember how I got out of the lab, but I ran as fast as I could. When I looked back, the windows were glowing with that same orange light.

That night, the dreams returned. But they weren’t dreams. I was back in the burning city, surrounded by screams. The fire wasn’t just fire anymore, it was alive.

And in the center of it all was the statue, glowing.

The voice spoke again, not as a whisper, not as a roar, but as a command.

*“You will finish the work.”*

I didn’t go back to the lab the next morning. I couldn’t. I told myself I was sick, that I needed time to think, to process what was happening. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t about rest.

It was fear.

The whispers didn’t stop. The dreams didn’t stop. And the statue was still there. Every time I tried to leave my apartment, I found it somewhere new—on my coffee table, on my kitchen counter, once even on my pillow. I hadn’t brought it home. I knew I hadn’t.

By the third day, I stopped questioning how it got there.

When I finally went back to the lab, the air was wrong. The temperature felt off—not cold, not warm. The shadows were worse, darker, moving even when the lights were steady.

I didn’t remember sitting down, but suddenly I was at the workbench, staring at it. The whispers filled the room, louder than before.

*“Finish the work.”*

I started writing again, the symbols pouring out of me like a fever. I didn’t know what they meant, but my hands didn’t stop.

And then the furnace turned on by itself.

The roar of the flames snapped me out of my trance. The statue wasn’t on the workbench anymore—it was inside the furnace, glowing brighter than ever, its surface shifting like molten lava.

I stepped closer, even though every instinct screamed at me to run. The glow filled the room, bathing everything in that sickly orange light. The air grew thicker, harder to breathe, and the shadows on the walls began to coalesce into shapes—human shapes, with long arms and empty eyes.

They didn’t stay on the walls.

The first one stepped out of the shadows, its movements jerky and unnatural. It didn’t have a face, just a void where one should’ve been. The others followed, dozens of them, their hands reaching for me, their whispers now a deafening roar.

I backed away, but they were everywhere. The door slammed shut behind me, and the walls began to close in, the green light pulsing like a heartbeat.

In the center of it all was the furnace. The statue was changing, growing, its surface shifting into something alive.

The voice spoke again, no longer in my head but all around me.

*“The work is done.”*

The shadows surged forward, their hands clawing at my skin, dragging me toward the furnace. I screamed, but it was swallowed by the roar of the flames.

The last thing I saw before everything went dark was the statue, its glowing symbols burned into my vision. And then I was falling into fire.

I don’t know how long I was gone. Time didn’t exist where I was just fire and shadows. The heat didn’t burn, but it pressed against me, crushing, suffocating. And the voices… they were everywhere. Screaming, whispering, laughing.

When I woke up, I was back in the lab. Or at least, what was left of it.

The walls were scorched black, streaked with ash and soot. Papers were scattered across the floor, their edges burned. The furnace was cold, its door hanging open, but the stench—the sulfur, the rot—was still there, stronger than ever.

And the statue... it was gone.

I don’t remember how I got home. My hands were shaking, my clothes reeked of smoke, and my reflection in the mirror didn’t look like me anymore. My eyes were sunken, my skin pale, my hands blistered like I’d been holding something burning.

But the worst part was the whispers. They hadn’t stopped.

They were louder now, constant, like a chorus just beneath the surface of my thoughts. I couldn’t drown them out, no matter how hard I tried.

That night, I dreamed of Jim. He was sitting in his hotel room, staring at the walls, his hands torched, the claw marks all around him. His eyes were blackened, empty, but his mouth moved, forming words I couldn’t hear.

When I woke up, the symbols were on my walls.

I didn’t write them. I couldn’t have. But there they were, scorched, the same patterns I’d seen in my notebook, in the statue. They were everywhere.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I tried to destroy the symbols, the notebook, everything. I even tried burning the room, but the flames didn’t touch it. The whispers only grew louder, the shadows closer.

Now, I’m sitting here, writing this, because I don’t know what else to do.

I can feel them, the symbols are glowing now, etched into my walls, my hands, my eyes.

The air smells like sulfur. The shadows are moving.

The furnace it’s glowing again.

I think I’m going back.
