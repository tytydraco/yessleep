Cutoff from the outside world, sat Mulligan’s Valley, a small rural town in McKinney, Texas. Established in 1978 by real estate mogul, Lance Mulligan, this “piece of paradise” was intended to serve as a sort of trial run for the modern day ‘utopia’. While seemingly unremarkable, this small-town development process was no small event. Mulligan and his team made headlines around the entire state and even inspired many other successful tycoons around the country to do the same thing he was doing. 

Because of his stature in Texas, his funding was of no question, all he had to do was deal with the city and state governing bodies; which proved to be suspiciously easy. Things were moving fast, and Lance had an almost concerning amount of passion about getting this project up and running. During the construction in the fall and winter months, a few select number of families were chosen and invited to be the first residents of Mulligan’s Valley. After a swift summer grand opening, and all the big news had died down, things in the Valley were running smoothly. People settled into their new designer homes so quickly that you’d think that they’d lived there for their entire lives. From an outside perspective, it truly looked like a piece of paradise. 
30 Years Later 

By the spring of 2010, Mulligan’s Valley had become just that, a Valley. Though the town still held (most) of its structural integrity, it had become void of any sense of utopia, much less paradise. In 1986, Lance Mulligan was disgraced and on the verge of bankruptcy. The very next year, he was charged with five counts of embezzlement and tax fraud. 

When the authorities received an arrest warrant for him; Mulligan and his wife Lila, suddenly disappeared. That night when the police searched the town to see where they could have gone, all they found was their abandoned car, with both doors swung open to the hinges, sitting at the edge of Craven’s Quarry. The town moved on pretty quickly from their deaths,  but the quarry never opened back up to the public; and for thirty years there’s been a security guard on site around the spot where their car was found ever since. 

Mulligan‘s dream had turned into any other overlooked small town in Texas. Over the years, those select number of families turned into anyone who was willing to move there, and The Valley fell into the ownership of the first wealthy person that offered to buy it. Some of the people willing to live there happened to be 16-year-old Charlie Jones and his family.
 Charlie was your average teenager, who had normal hobbies, like photography and biking the town trails with his close group of friends. He kept solid b’s and c’s in school, which would be more than enough for him to get into a good state university when he applies next year. Charlie lived with his mother, Rose, who worked as vice principal at his high school, Halloran High, which was the only high school in town. His older sister, Veronica, a recent early graduate from Rice University, has just moved in back home before spring break. Charlie loved his small family and his small life in his small town.  

~The Phone At The Bottom Of Craven’s Quarry~


BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BE-

Veronica, hungover and annoyed, bursts into Charlie’s room and loudly slams on his alarm clock to turn off the blaring sounds. “How can you possibly sleep through that?” She says, while holding her forehead in her hand. Charlie, barely conscious, moans his witty remark, “I can’t, but usually there isn’t a strange unemployed woman in my room who wakes me up”.  “I set that for 8:15, it’s spring break, why do this to me?” Charlie says, as he yawns and sits up on his bed. “Blame Mom, she wanted to make sure you didn’t skip today.” Veronica walks out of the room and starts making herself a pot of coffee. 

Even though his mother, Rose had authority on campus and even more at his home, Charlie and his friends had a proclivity for skipping school on days where they thought would be spent better elsewhere. Today was no different. After waking up, Charlie starts his normal morning routine of hygiene and sitting on his bed while staring at his open closet trying pick his outfit for the day. In the middle of him changing, he hears a tap on his bedroom window; but when he went to check, there was nothing there. Charlie sat back down on his bed to tie his shoes and once again, a tap on his window. He cautiously opened his curtains another time and looked all around outside and just as he was starting to feel uneasy, Charlie’s best friend, Shaun Willmore, popped up from the ground. “WATCHU DOIN’ IN THERE?” Shaun screams at the window in an elderly accent. Charlie gives a sarcastic “ha ha” before opening the window to let Shaun in.

 “You almost ready?” Shaun says while crawling through the windowsill. “Tracy and Noah are already on the way to the quarry to get set up.” “Yeah, give me one sec”, Charlie replies while finishing the final loops of his shoelaces. After sneaking into the kitchen and avoiding his sister to grab water bottles for their trip, the two friends grab their bags full of supplies ready for the day, and head out back through the window to start another adventure. 

After a 45-minute sunny and breeze filled bike ride to the edge of town, Charlie and Shaun arrive at a stretch of an unkept, pine oak - filled forest that covered the rest of the way to Craven’s Quarry. The boys attempted to ride through the overgrown and out-rooted woods, but after one minute of bumping their years old bmx bikes on root knubs and and rocks, they decided to walk the rest of the way. When they arrived at border of the forest, A voice from the trees shouts “LEROY JENKINS!” As an arsenal of water balloons begins to get launched at Shaun and Charlie.                

“Alright guys, you got water in my eardrum. Mission accomplished”, Shaun yells at the trees, as Tracy and Noah begin to climb down from their hiding spots with their buckets. “It was all Noah’s idea” Tracy says, with the biggest smile on her face that was so infectious it almost forced you to smile. 

“Hey! Throw me right under the bus, why don’t you?” 

Noah exclaims while laughing. “Sorry though boys, I walked outside this morning, and it just felt too good not to do to sumbody. You can point the blame at Tracy for that aerial guerilla attack; she’s the gymnast here. I’m pretty sure I pulled something on the way up and on the way down.”  The four friends, all together, start walking to the quarry cove, where the opening acted as the shore of a beach where people could sit and swim. After laying out all their blankets and putting their stuff down in their spots, they all sat down and sparked a joint. On this hot Friday morning, aside from a scattered call by a nearby bird, or a rare jump out of water from an energized bass, Craven’s Quarry was dead silent.

 “So what do you guys wanna do first?” Tracy says to the group, while looking in her bag for water. Charlie, stoned and looking up at the clouds, dozed off back asleep like he had never gotten out of his bed. 

About an hour had passed and while Charlie is just waking up, the rest of the group placed their bikes on the ground, having returned from a journey into the unexplored trails. Shaun, Tracy, and Noah only sat down for a minute to drink some water and catch their breaths; then right back up they got, ready to take a swim in the Quarry. 

“You coming, Sleeping Snookie? Or are you still working on your tan” Noah shouts as the three of them are waiting for Charlie to join them. Charlie begrudgingly takes off his shirt and his shoes and goes to join his friends in a cool dip in the water. Following four games of chicken, two lap races, and one game of ‘who can hold their breath the longest’, the group waded in the water together, enjoying their time in Texas sun. “Can it possibly get better than this?” Shaun says with a cheesed grin. “I would hope so. We still have a whole week ahead.” 
 
The whole group laughed and smiled with each other. Then suddenly, a pale look appeared on all of their faces instantly. The distant and muffled vibration of a cell phone call started alarming underneath them. There was at least 10 feet of water between the bottom of their heels and the floor of the quarry where the sound was coming from. 

MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMMRRRR - MMMMMMMMRRRR

The thought of a working cellphone at the bottom of 15 feet of water was nightmare fuel enough for the group of friends to ride away from Craven’s Quarry and never return, but in that moment, a peculiar thought ran through Shaun’s head. “You already know what we have to do guys” 

“Absolutely not”, Tracy says, with the same frightened look on her face. “We need to get out of here now.”

Ever since the disappearance of the Mulligan‘s, the residents of the valley knew that there was something off about Craven’s Quarry and that there was found no harm in staying far away from it. All of the friend groups’s parents had previously warned them about going near the quarry as well,  but  a town wide myth and mystery is every curious teenagers Achilles’ heel. 


“I don’t think this is such a good idea”, Charlie exclaims as Shaun arrives back to the group holding a snorkel from his bag. “It’ll only be two minutes, then we can leave, I just need to see what I can find.” Shaun turns fully into the water and dives down to the floor. Two minutes and a dozen air bubbles go by and Shaun hasn’t come up to the surface. The three remaining friends start to go as deep as they can to the surface, but none of them were as good of swimmers as Shaun is. After minutes and minutes of trying to dive down, they become tired and even more afraid. “Oh my god” Tracy mumbles, trying to stop herself from crying.

 “We have to go get sumbody”, Noah says while splashing around frantically. “No one’ll get here in time, we have to save him ourselves” Charlie exclaims, trying to keep on a brave face. Just as the trio catch their breath and prepared to go back under once more, small bubbles began to raise up to the surface. 

Then, a pop and a splash from the water, leaving only a small, floating, algae covered, black object. “What the hell?”, they all say, almost in unison. Just as Noah was about to grab the device, the phone began to ring once more. 

MMMMMMRRR- 

Noah picked up the old flip phone before it could ring another time. “H-Hello” he said cautiously. After several unanswered seconds, Noah says in a disturbed tone “it just sounds like…water.” Immediately after finishing his sentence, Noah is dragged and taken under the water before he could even let out another breath. “What the fuck? NOAH!”, Tracy screams, as the silhouette of her best friend was submerged completely. 

“C’mon Tracy, we need to get back to the shore now!” Charlie and Tracy start swimming frantically back to the shore, where all their stuff and their bikes laid. The noise of their gasps and anxious kicks in the water being the only sound in the area, echoed throughout the quarry. Before he could turn around to check and see if she was still close behind him, the sounds of Tracy‘s breaststrokes and heavy breathing suddenly went silent. 

Charlie was all alone. Part of him was convinced that he was dreaming all of this; he could still be in bed waiting for his alarm to go off for a great last day of school or maybe he’s sleeping off his high on the lake shore and everything that has happened is just some THC induced fantasy.  Maybe none of this was real. That’s what Charlie hoped for.  Realizing that he could nearly touch the ground with his feet and that he was close to the shore, Charlie began to go full swim and then sprint the rest of the way. Charlie, finally back on land, made his way to his things where he could grab his cellphone out of his shoes.

 Tripping on the rocks with his wet feet, Charlie crawled to his cellphone and began to go to his contacts to call his mom from school. Just as he arrived at her name, he looked up to see the faint current of the water washing away but leaving that same dirty phone on a pile of rocks. Charlie crawled over to it and began to investigate the device. Wiping the algae and grime off the exterior shell of the phone revealed a retro Motorola logo and an engraved L.M. on it. 

Charlie instantly knew who those initials stood for, everyone who ever lived in the valley did. Lance Mulligan and his wife were the reason why this spot was such a desired and feared place to adventure in. Right when Charlie begins to wrap his mind around everything and make the call to his mom, The phone that had caused all of these problems, rang once more. 


MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMRRRRR- MMMMMMMRRRR- 

Charlie was deathly afraid, but also oddly curious and suspecting of what would happen if he answered the phone call. 

“HELLO?” Charlie yelled, trying to convince himself that he had any shred of confidence. “WHO THE HELL IS THIS?” Suddenly- A break in the static and a familiar breathing pattern came onto the line.  It was heavy, it was desperate and scared, it was — Shaun
. 
“Charlie…I’m sorry. We shouldn’t have come here, man”. All of a sudden, two giant chains made of water shot out of the lake and wrapped themselves tightly around Charlie’s ankles. “W-what!” As Charlie begins being pulled back to the depths of Cravens Quarry, he hears the tire squeals of a car from up above. 

Jerry Forchheimer, the security of the quarry for the past five years, arrived late to his overlook post that morning. 

“HELP!” exclaimed Charlie, as he was being dragged further and further down to where his friends had just met their fate. Fighting and scratching till his last breath, Charlie lets one last “HE-“ before being fully submerged in Craven’s Quarry. Only the soft ripples of the water remained as the four friends were taken away, never to be seen again. 

Jerry gets out of his car too late. He begins his mundane patrol when he spots the groups bikes and supplies laying on the shore all nearby together. Zooming in closer with his binoculars, he gathers a detailed report of all of the items, and then begins to survey the water of the quarry. 

He takes out his radio and makes a call. 

“Hey boss, it’s Jerry. I just started my shift here at Craven’s for the day and uh…. I think it happened again.”
