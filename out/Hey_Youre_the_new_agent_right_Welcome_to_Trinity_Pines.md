**Today was my first day. I'm going to go back through my recording, and write down everything he said. It's an easy way to memorize it.**

"Hey! You’re the new agent, right? Welcome to Trinity Pines!

"I know it doesn’t look like much, but I promise, there’s a lot more going on here than you know. Oh what’s that? You say you have been briefed on the job? That’s great! It’s just a start though. Trust me, you’ll be glad that they made you take those behavioral science and counterterrorism courses. Probably doesn’t seem like it right now, but you’ll use both.

"That reminds me, have you gone through all the certifications? Tactical Operations, and Emergency Vehicle Operations, that’s a start. Until you’ve got all the others I listed there, you won’t be able to handle the night shift.

"And look, before you say anything, I know that being baptized is typically a religious thing, but it’s just a requirement for your job here. Oh, and using the actual silver as a tattoo will be covered by the Government. You even get to pick the design. Just make sure it’s on your forearms and your neck. My best bud is Hawaiian, and he gave me some wicked tattoo designs. He operates a similar place to this out on the other side of the world. Well, not literally. That would be in the Indian Ocean. His is in the Pacific. Anyway, these tattoos look rad in the moonlight.

"Alright, I’m gonna take you on a tour of the grounds. Just as a precaution, you’ll be sticking by my side for the first month or so. Eventually your instincts will be sharp enough that you can do this on your own. Usually there aren’t any incidents, this place is fairly self-sufficient at this point. You’re here more as a formality, to let the Government know that they ain’t wastin’ their money. That, and you'll be running the Supernatural Hunting Information Training for the FBI here in a few months. You don't need to do much, and it makes sense that you didn't take the training yourself. You're here to build a relationship with the locals, not learn how to hunt others like them.

"We don’t have a list of rules here or some manual. Who would even write down a list of rules and just leave? Just let you rawdog this by yourself? Seems like a lazy way to get around actually training your employees. Or shadier shit.

"Anyway, we’re coming up on the first and most important building. This is Michael Carmine Hall. This, to put it simply, is your safehouse. If anything ever goes wrong, day or night, flee into this building. You’ll be safe here. I’ll introduce you to Father Tenebris once the sun goes down, he’s the head of the church under the Hall. He’s been here almost as long as I have, he knows all the local residents and all the troublemakers. Man, you shoulda seen the bishop’s face when he realized the church was underground, and insisted on going inside. I about peed myself, it was so funny. Since then, the Vatican has just left them alone. 

"Though, they're not  t e c h n i c a l l y  Catholic, I think they're some kind of separate order. 'Interfectores inmortuitatis' or something.

"Anyway, he knows what goes on here. If it weren’t for him, the other fathers, and the sisters here, there’s no way this place would be safe. Their strength is nuts, the speed is fun to watch. I’ve only seen them shift once. Pretty rad. It’s kinda ironic, kinda sad that they take the vow of Obedience to uphold the light of God, but can’t even go out in the sun. You’ll see them come and go fairly often. They might return with more than they left with, that’s fine. Most of the time they don’t. Nine times out of ten, if your supervisor comes to visit, he’s here to talk to them.

"Anyway, I’ll introduce you to them later.

"That out there is our resident tall grass. Don’t look at it for too long, it’s pretty shy, and we don’t need it moving somewhere else again. The Needlebacks already have your scent, and you’re still here, so you’ll be fine.

"Just past the tall grass is where the river cuts through the campgrounds. If you’ve got a four-wheeler, just start driving into the grass, and you’ll find the path, it’ll lead you to the river. We’ve got a gem delivery coming up on Wednesday. I’ll teach you how to handle the Grootslang then. Oh, and if Creusa ever offers to take you fishing, go for it. She’s pretty, and pretty nice. Just make sure you catch-and-release.

"Ah, but over here we’ve got Lycatt Barn. We won’t go in until you’ve got your tattoos. The groundskeepers are lovely. Every full moon, the clergy and the groundskeepers play Rugby, which is honestly my favorite part of working here. You wouldn’t think that priests, monks, and nuns would be able to give the groundskeepers competition, but it’s actually super competitive. It’s also a total blast. I love full moons. If you need a gun or a four-wheeler, hit them up, they’ve always got some, and they’re in great condition. They’ve made trouble a few times, but I don’t imagine they’ll do so again for awhile. Most of the troublemakers got moved to a more secure facility. If things do actually start getting hairy, head to Michael Carmine.

"What’s that? Jurisdiction? You don’t need to worry about that. Yeah, I know, plain view doctrine, protective sweep, exigent circumstances. You don’t need to worry about being lawfully able to be on the premises, or probable cause, not even reasonable suspicion.   
T e c h n i c a l l y  this place is a prison, and nothing here has any fourth amendment rights, so we have the legal capability to go anywhere here. Though honestly, you should be more concerned about keeping people out than keeping things in. That’s where the real trouble happens. Now, that doesn’t mean you should just be going anywhere here. Especially not the Forest, unless you’ve got a tac team, or at least a crossbow. Leave that to the groundskeepers. Listen to your instincts, thousands of years of evolution know better than that FBI training.

"You ever watched horror movies? Same, my favorite is The Descent, though The Devil Below was actually pretty good. 

"Wait, am I just claustrophobic?

"Whatever. Thing is, you know how frustrating it is to watch characters in a horror movie that act irrationally, but you’re initially willing to give grace to them because they don’t yet *know* that they’re in a horror movie?

"Well, I’m telling you now, best way to avoid being a ‘character in a horror movie’ is to always assume that you are in a horror movie. Pretty much covers all the bases.

"Anyway, see that hatch right there? Well, suffice to say, I *will not* be taking you down there. Oh no, it’s not that bad at all, supposedly. Your predecessor went down there constantly. Apparently they’re pretty friendly, and quite gracious too. They also routinely kicked his ass in chess. Nevertheless, I refuse to go down there. Personally, I’d rather go in the Forest without a crossbow than down there.

"Ah, and here we are! This is your new home, my dear Warden. It’s got all the warding, all the safeguards, not even the priests can get in here. If something *does* get in there, head directly to Michael Carmine. Don’t look back. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.

"This here is SF. No, I don’t know what it stands for, but he is a good boy. He lives right here in the stables right next to your house. Disregard the red eyes, he doesn’t have an evil bone in his body. Most of the time, you’ll be using him to ride around the park. I reckon you’d even be safe in the Forest if you’re riding him.  I’ll show you how to saddle him up tomorrow morning. Wait, no, tomorrow morning you’re getting your tattoos and baptism. Tomorrow evening then. You can go ahead and let him out of his stall, he’ll follow us.

"Alright, let’s keep going. You see that over there? Just about a mile down the road? Yeah, the place that looks like a frat house. How astute, because it’s practically… what was that? Oh yeah, it’s basically always blaring music. Well, apparently, it’s “Phonk” but I honestly have no idea what that means. It just sounds like noise to me. But hey, not my circus, not my monkeys. Well, they’re not monkeys anyway. Yeah so that’s where the incubi and succubi are.

"Frankly, I’d highly recommend staying out of there, unless you have to. Unfortunately, “have to” is gonna happen a lot. See, usually those guys and gals can keep each other entertained but they figured out what “spring breakers” are, and they’ve gotten really good at luring them in. Doesn’t matter how hard we work, they just always seem to get people in. We go in every Friday and Saturday night at 11 p.m., sharp, and we do a breathalyzer check on everyone there. See, only humans will register on the breathalyzer. Usually we “arrest” them before they get wise or get killed. Make up some bullshit about getting wasted on a federal land. Make up the legal lingo, we won’t actually be arresting them, just detaining them temporarily, so no court will give a shit. If we don’t catch them before midnight… well, we’ll know.

"Halloween parties with them, hooo boy those are a blast. Something about Halloween makes them much more tame then usual. It's about the only time it's safe enough to party with them. I guess because it's the opposite of humans? Safe enough to have some good old fun, if you catch my drift. Unless you’ve taken a vow of celibacy like our friends at Michael Carmine, there’s definitely gonna be something worth your time in there.

"Aaaaanyway. We’re at our last major stop of the evening. This is only about 10% of the park, but we’ll get around to the rest later. Just the basics first.

"This, well, this is the Forest. This is the reason they had you take that wilderness survival course. This is the place where they put things that like to *hunt*. Most of the time they just hunt each other, it’s a pretty cool ecosystem. But every once in a while, that ecosystem gets out of wack, and we gotta call in a specialist. That or it’ll attract a new resident, and it’s gotta be rooted out. Most dangerous part is probably the Forest itself, though. One time I got stuck in there for a few decades. No big deal, plenty of food, nice and peaceful. Got a little monotonous, eventually. Got out, and apparently only an hour had passed outside the Forest. Spoopy. Oh, I will give you one rule. Never, EVER fire a gun in the Forest. It hates that, everything in there hates that, and I guarantee that you will have a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. For a short time, at least.

"Anyway, that’s gonna be it for today. We’ll head back to your new home, and you can call it a night. I’ll be up all night patrolling. I’m on channel 5 on your walkie if you need anything."

  
**Guess I finally found it.**
