My name is Arthur. I’m 36 and recently divorced.

The reason for it? I’m not so sure myself. I suppose Alicia got tired of having what she once called a “boring family.”

Still, we didn’t even need to go to court over custody! Lucas stayed with me. He’s twelve, and for that alone, I suppose I should be grateful.

Things without Alicia were rough at first... Lucas blamed me, then he’d break down five minutes later and apologize through tears.

But, as a wise man once said, "*Time heals all wounds."*

I eventually managed to get a house outside the city, far from the noise and constant pressure. It's a pretty simple place! It's a single-story house with a kitchen, a toilet, a living room, and two bedrooms—one for Lucas and one for me.

It surprised me how happy Lucas got when he found out about our home. He hasn't been very expressive lately—unless the topic is, of course, crying. This just felt right. A fresh start.

We spent the afternoon moving furniture around the place, putting Lucas’ things in his room, and trying to keep Cookie—our dog—from getting under our feet every five seconds. He followed us from room to room, tail wagging, like he was just as excited about the move as Lucas was.

I gave Cookie his food, me and Lucas had some pizza for dinner, and night quickly approached.  
Lucas went to his room, and I went to mine. Safe to say, it didn't take me long to fall asleep.

It didn't take me long to wake up either.

I woke up to that unmistakable feeling of being watched. I scanned the room, but it was empty. Just shadows and unfamiliar shapes in the dark.  
"*Just the usual new place paranoia"*, I thought to myself.

Then I heard scratching at my door.

I exhaled, relieved, and whispered as quietly as I could, loud enough to be heard, “Not tonight, Cook. Go to sleep…”

The scratching stopped.

I let my head fall back onto the pillow. With a sigh, I closed my eyes... Then, something shifted near the foot of the bed.

Cookie lifted his head over the frame, eyes half-closed, ears twitching at the sound of his name.

The scratching started again.

Shocked, I quickly swung my feet out of the bed and stood up. I approached the door and kneeled before it, sticking my eye to the keyhole. As I peered through it, I couldn't see a thing. Everything was pitch black.

Suddenly, an eye appeared from the darkness. Not blinking, not moving, just... staring.  
It was so close you could barely see its eyelids.  
The pupil was unnaturally small, and the iris was surrounded by these dark-red veins.

I quickly got up and swung the door open — Nothing.

No sight of who or what was causing the creepy eye. No sounds too. Just the long, empty, and dark hallway.

I quickly grabbed Cookie and brought him with me to Lucas' room.  
Trying my hardest not to wake him up, I locked the door and laid on the floor, hugging Cook until we drifted to sleep.

The next day was mostly normal, apart from Lucas questioning why I’d been sleeping on his floor. He’s just a kid dealing with a divorce, I won't bother him with my night terrors.

We spent the day finishing the decorating. Night came again, and this time I placed my pistol in the top drawer of my nightstand. It might seem extreme, but when you’ve been woken by something that shouldn’t exist, caution feels reasonable.

Lucas was asleep. I grabbed cookie and headed to my room. I locked the bedroom door, placed Cook on the bed and placed my Tom Sawyer blanket on top of us. We slowly drifted into sleep.

Not for too long.

This time, it wasn't scratching. It was breathing. Heavy breathing.  
Cook trembled beside me.  
I stood up and marched towards the door, kneeling before it once more as I looked through the keyhole.

The eye was there.

"Go away. Leave us alone." I whispered, trying to keep my voice steady, in hopes he, or it, would leave.

And, just like that, it moved. Slowly upwards to the left, leaving me with the hallway's darkness.  
Even though it had left, I wasn't sure whether I should feel relieved or worried.

I slid the pistol from my drawer and set it on the nightstand. I laid down once again, comforting Cook as I placed my arm around him, listening closely to the silence.

Then I heard a voice. A muffled voice. "Dad, what are you doing? It's not funny...".

My heart froze. With all my speed, I grabbed the pistol and ran to my son's room.

That... **thing.** It was trying to harm my son. I wouldn't allow it. Never.

As I reached the outside of his bedroom door, I couldn't see anything or anyone. I opened the door and my son was sitting in the bed, the blanket up to his face.

"Dad? What's going on?" he asked, his eyes wide.

"Nothing, son... Just... go back to sleep. You just had a bad dream." I murmered, hiding the pistol behind my back.

Every encounter with that thing ended the same way — it vanished.

I called Cook and had him get in bed with Lucas. After comforting both, I went to the living room and looked for my ex-wife's sewing tools. In a hurry to leave our old and boring family, she didn't even bother to take them with her. Thank God.

After searching through countless drawers, I found a thin sewing pin that'd easily slip through the keyhole.  
"*Let's see you spy on us again."* I thought to myself.

I went back to my son's room, both the pistol and the pin in hand. Lucas and Cook were asleep. I sat on the floor and just waited. And waited.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the breathing came back. Heavy.

I approached the door, the pin ready in my right hand, the pistol as a last resource in my left.

I kneeled and pressed my eye to the keyhole — There it was again. That disgusting, unblinking eye.

"What do you want?" I whispered.

Nothing. No blinking. No movement. Just that unnerving stare

“Fine,” I muttered, my voice shaking, “let’s see you react to this.”

I shifted my grip on the sewing pin, gripping it tighter. Slowly and carefully, I placed it at the entrance of the keyhole.

Then, with a swift motion, I pressed it forward—*POP*—that's all I heard before the darkness swallowed me.

When I woke up, I wasn’t in Lucas' room. I was lying on the living room floor. The house was silent. Everything looked normal.

Except my left eye.

It was gone.
