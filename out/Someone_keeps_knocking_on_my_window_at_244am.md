The farmhouse waits at the end of a gravel road, half forgotten. White paint peels in strips, the porch tilts, and the roofline sags over the kitchen. It is a tired house. Nobody with money would want it, but the rent was low and the place promised quiet. That was enough for me.

The silence out here has weight. In town you always hear something, even at three in the morning. Tires on wet pavement. A bottle breaking in an alley. Somebody arguing through thin apartment walls. Here it is only the wind through the trees. At first I thought it was peaceful. Then I noticed how loud silence becomes when you are lying in bed waiting for sleep.

The house has its own voice. The boards creak when they feel like it. The water heater sighs like an old man settling into a chair. The pipes knock if you ask too much hot water at once. I got used to it. The noises became familiar, and I knew them all.

That is why the new sound woke me.

It was 2:44 in the morning. I checked the phone beside the bed. The room was black and still. Then it came: three slow taps against the window glass.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

The bedroom is upstairs. No balcony. No porch roof. No trees close enough to scrape the window. Nothing that should reach that high.

I sat up and stared at the curtains. Listened. The sound didn’t come again. I laid back down and told myself it was nothing. A bird. The siding shifting in the cold. Anything at all. I didn’t believe it, but the thought carried me until daylight.

The next evening I came home from work and pulled into the drive. The sun was low, hitting the house at an angle. I looked up at the bedroom window and thought I saw three faint smears on the glass, as if someone had pressed their fingertips there. When I went inside and checked, the glass was clear.

That night I left the curtains open. My phone on the nightstand. I fell asleep waiting.

Again, 2:44. The screen lit up. I held still.

And then it came, polite and steady.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

The third night I stayed awake for it. Not on purpose. I laid there staring at the ceiling until my eyes burned. Every sound of the house was magnified. I watched the phone glow 2:43. My chest was tight. At 2:44 I heard it.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Same rhythm. Same glassy tone. I turned my head toward the window and stared. Nothing but my own faint reflection in the dark. I pulled the curtains shut and sat there for an hour before I could lie down again.

By morning I had an explanation ready. Old frame shifting. Siding popping in the cold. That was what I told myself. That was what I tried to believe.

The fourth night I set an alarm for 2:40. I wanted to be sitting upright, ready to laugh at myself when nothing happened. At 2:44 the sound came. Three steady taps. The laugh caught in my throat.

The fifth night I tried logic. I went outside before bed with a flashlight and circled the house. The ground was soft from last week’s rain, but there were no prints in the mud below the window. Nothing had climbed the siding. Nothing had brushed the glass.

Inside, I checked the locks. Tight. I even wedged a chair against the frame for reassurance. I slept badly. At 2:44 the knock came through just the same.

By the sixth night my nerves were thin. I set my phone on the dresser facing the window, camera recording. I felt foolish, like a child trying to prove there is a monster under the bed. I laid down and waited.

2:44. The knock came.

In the morning I played back the video. Only static in the dark, the faint outline of the curtains. At the 2:44 mark the camera jolted, as if the phone had been slapped out of a hand. The screen went black for a minute. Then the recording resumed. The curtains hung still. The phone sat untouched where I had left it.

I watched the clip again. And again. My stomach turned each time. I was late for work because I kept staring at the window, looking for some mark I had missed.

The only thing I saw was my own face in the glass.

By the seventh night I stopped making excuses. It was not pipes or siding. It was not an owl. It was not my imagination. Something was outside that window at 2:44 every morning, and it wanted me to know it.

I decided I would look.

That night I left the curtains wide open and sat in bed with the lamp off. The silence pressed so hard it rang in my ears. Every shadow in the room felt like it was holding its breath.

At 2:44 the sound came.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

I turned my head immediately.

A face was pressed against the glass. My face. The skin looked bloodless and pulled too tight, like it had been stretched over the bone and left to dry. The lips were peeled back in a grin that showed not just teeth but the dark of the gums. The eyes were wide and glassy, staring into mine without a blink, and with every shallow fog of breath against the window, the chest behind it heaved in perfect rhythm with my own.

I froze. My tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth. The thing outside tilted its head slowly, as if testing how much I could stand before breaking. The smile trembled, straining at the edges until the corners split raw. Then it made a sound through the glass, a wet, hitching rasp that began like a wheeze and ended like someone trying to laugh through water.

I wanted to move. I wanted to scream. All I could do was watch.

Then the sound came again.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

From behind me. Inside the room.

That broke me. I lunged for the lamp and snapped it on. The bed was empty beside me. The curtains swayed as if touched by a hand. The air smelled faintly of damp earth.

The phone on the nightstand said 2:45.

I don't know what I will do tonight. I don't know if I can stay here another hour, let alone another night. If I hear that knocking again, I'm not sure I will have the strength to look.
