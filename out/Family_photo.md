It happened a few years ago. Me and my friend Ben were walking our usual route at night, from my house to his. We live in the middle of nowhere, so it was quite dark out but we pretty much knew everyone in the neighborhood, if you can even call it that. I live on a dirt road that pulls out onto a highway, which is pretty vacant at night. We'd walk on the side the cars were coming to be safe. On our left, houses with porch lights on and to our left, woods. Not endless, scary woods, there was a trailer park and a few houses (one mine) a few hundred feet away. So we were never scared walking together, even joking that Ben's long, slender frame and my small, large shape made us look "intimidating." Neither of us believed that, but it helped on some of the colder, quieter nights. 

But this night wasn't like others. It was eerily quiet. The missing sound of cars was fine enough, but no animals, nothing. We didn't make a big deal of it, but looking back that might be why we were even more freaked out to see in a distant streetlight, someone walking towards us. Now it was a little over a mile to Ben's house, so we would have to come in contact with this person if we kept walking. No issue, just kinda weird as we never saw anyone out this late, about 4 in the morning. The dude was hunched over, walking fast, a hoodie over his head. It didn't take him too long to reach us, and being friendly guys we didn't wanna switch over to the other side to seem rude. When he got to us, he spoke. "Hi guys. Out late, huh?"  
"Yeah, I suppose..." I said, trying to stop my voice from shaking. It wasn't fear, just social anxiety. The guy sounded around our age, but couldn't really see him in the dark. "Where ya headed?" He spoke again. Ben answered this time, shrugging. "Heading to my house to relax with some video games and probably pass out in the morning, haha." 

There was a pause, and the guy kinda laughed. "Sounds fun. Mind if I come along?" He laughed again, sounding a bit awkward. "Well, we don't know you, so..." Ben didn't get the words out before the guy had reached into his pocket, grabbing his wallet. "What the fuck" he yelled out, trying to grab the guy. I had barely any time to react, trying to pull on his hoodie as he took off. "Hey asshole, come back here!" Ben yelled out. We heard a few dogs start to bark as he ran, Ben's stolen wallet open as he went through it. Laughing, he turned back, his hood falling down and we could see him smile. It was a creepy, wide eyed smile from ear to ear. The guy didn't look weird or anything, but that smile....

He ended up tossing the wallet to the ground and kept running, across the road into the woods nearby. We ran over to Ben's wallet, not sure if chasing this weirdo was a good idea. After catching our breath and Ben checking his wallet, he sounded relieved when he said "No money is gone. Cards are all here..." I laughed and sat down, head spinning from what had just happened. After a few more seconds, Ben spoke again, this time a little concerned. "My family's picture is missing..." "What?" I said back, still panting. I knew the picture. It was the family photo of his mom, dad, sister and dog. He had been trying to set the auto timer and took a pic by accident. They used the picture he finally got right as the holiday card, but he kept this one in his wallet. "What the fuck would some random weirdo want with that?" I said to him, but he just shrugged it off.

We eventually made it to his house, where his dad was still awake watching some drama show he had been into lately. We told him what had happened, and decided eventually to tell the police what had happened. Few days passed, and as you can probably guess, they'd keep an eye out but nothing really ever came of it. It became a weird story we'd laugh about for the next few months. 

Almost exactly one year later, Ben's dad would die in a car accident. It hurt him and his family deeply, he was a good man and we had all been super close, even me. We both bawled our eyes out when we heard what was assume to be a drunk driver hit and run. They never caught the guy. They held a wake at his home, and we all reminisced. How he would come in when we were gaming and challenge us, being really good at Mario Kart and Tekken games. After the wake, Ben and I decided to take a walk and stayed out for hours, just kinda walking in silence. We arrived back at his house at dark, hoping not to wake his sleeping mother and sister. But the yell Ben let out definitely did as he came to his door. Stapled right there was a white piece of paper, and as Ben shook and panted loudly, I took a look. A small, cut out piece of a picture was glued to the paper, unmistakably Ben's dad from the picture he had took years ago. Underneath, in messy handwriting it simply said "One down."
