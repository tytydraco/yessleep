Have you ever made a split second decision that changed your life so profoundly and horribly that you wish you could take it back? When I was a little girl, the decision I made resulted in my becoming half of who I should be. My memory of that day is so clear, even after all the therapy that had tried to replace it with something “real”.

“Hey Lisa, come over here. Look what I found!” Linda called from her perch on the windowsill. I looked up from my coloring book and saw my twin studying a bug crawling up the side of the window. “I’ve never seen one like this before,” she said, leaning in for a closer look.

I hopped off my bed and crossed over to her side of the room, carefully stepping over her army of plush animals to get to her window. I climbed up on her bedside table and looked at the little bug, which had stopped crawling and now stood still in front of my sister’s squinting eyes. “Isn’t that a box elder beetle?” I inquired, recognizing the pattern on its back. Like everyone else in the neighborhood, we would have lots of them living in our house every few winters. My mother had told us that we wouldn’t be able to get rid of them unless we first removed the trees for which they were named. I didn’t mind since they were cute and friendly. This one, though… “Why is it green?”

“That’s what I wanna know,” Linda replied. Then, without hesitation, she snatched up the little bug and tossed it into her mouth, swallowing it whole. “Ewwwww!” she exclaimed, looking like she wanted to be sick. She jumped off the sill and pranced around on her bed, slapping at her tongue, spitting, and coughing. Her face burned red as tears began to run down her face.

“Why the heck did you do that!” I couldn’t believe that my sister had just eaten a bug, especially a weird green one. Who knew what was wrong with that thing? I briefly thought about one of those nature shows that my father liked to watch on Saturday mornings, in which the narrator had warned about the dangerous toxins on the skins of some brightly colored frogs. The green coloring on that beetle had been so bright that it had almost seemed to glow. My nose wrinkled in disgust even as my heart began to hammer with worry for my other me.

Linda finally calmed down enough to grab a juice box from our mini fridge and drink it down until there was none left. I felt somewhat relieved that she was grossed out by having done what she did. I didn’t want to think that my own sister would enjoy consuming creepy crawlies. She gave me an exasperated look when I asked again why she would do such a thing. “I don’t know, okay? I didn’t even think about doing it. It just happened. Yuck!” She spit on the floor one more time before looking back at me with wide eyes. “You can’t tell anyone I did that, okay?”

I was thinking about who I might tell first when my mom yelled from downstairs. “Girls, it’s time for piano lessons!” Linda and I both groaned. Like many kids in our area, we were being taught to play the piano by our neighbor, Old Lady Rose. She was so old that my mother had called her by the same moniker when she had taken lessons from her as a child. My mother, having been a somewhat lonely little girl, looked back fondly on those hours spent with the ancient pianist, and encouraged us to get to know the old lady better. But Linda and I weren’t so lonely.

“Oh great,” moaned Linda. “I already swallowed a bug, and now I have to go choke down some of Old Lady Rose’s cookies.”

“Her cookies aren’t that bad,” I shrugged. I actually thought her oatmeal cookies were pretty awesome, even if the lady was kind of strange. Her emerald-green eyes seemed to know too much, and her blue-black hair seemed a strange color for a woman her age. She also had way too many snow globes around her house. In her living room alone, there had been at least 30 of them, all about the size of a fortune teller’s crystal ball. Each globe contained a unique scene that came with a creepy background if you cared to ask the old woman about it. I was more curious than my sister, but I was told that many of the globes held stories that would have to be told when I was older.

“Her cookies are terrible,” Linda spat. “Maybe if I break another two or three of her snow globes, she’ll finally refuse to keep teaching us.” She pulled the pink ribbon out of her ponytail so that her hair hung straight down like mine. “She wouldn’t even know who to blame,” she smirked.

I smiled uneasily. I had almost forgotten that the last time we’d gone to the pianist’s house, my twin had “accidentally” elbowed a snow globe off one of the shelves in the room. The woman had looked heartbroken but had accepted our apologies and my mother’s offer to pay for it. The thing was that Old Lady Rose was really kind and generous. I knew that Linda didn’t really dislike her. She was just acting out because she hated playing the piano. I didn’t like taking lessons either, but I didn’t want to cause trouble for our elderly neighbor. Now, as we left the house with our mother, I silently prayed that my sister would just be nice to her for a change.

After our lessons, we returned home to find dinner already set at the dining room table. I was extra happy to find that my father had made his special spaghetti with sugar and garlic, just the way I like it. I ended up eating two whole plates of it, while Linda only poked hers around with her fork. It was unusual for her as she loved our father’s spaghetti as much as I did, but she was probably too full to eat much after having scarfed down so many of the neighbor’s cookies. That had also been strange, but I figured she was still trying to bury the taste of eating that bug earlier.

When dinner was through, it was obvious that my sister wasn’t feeling well, so my mother gave her some ginger ale to settle her stomach and sent us to bed early. The two of us always went to bed at the same time by choice, so I had no complaints about getting more rest if my other me needed it. That night, we didn’t say much to each other as we lay in our beds, watching each other by the light of the moon until we fell asleep.

Later that night, I was awakened by my sister’s breath on my face. It still smelled of the berry mouthwash we used after brushing our teeth. I opened my eyes and found her face hovering above mine. At first, I thought she had put on some weird mask to scare me, as she had done once as a prank. But when I reached out a hand and pushed her back, I realized that was not the case this time.

Linda’s entire body was covered in a writhing mass of box elder beetles. Every inch of her face, except for her glowing green eyes, was smothered in layers of the little bugs. When she opened her mouth to speak, I could see that they even coated her teeth and tongue. “Come with me, Lisa,” she beckoned, extending a hand to me to offer up one of those weird green beetles like we had seen earlier.

In fear and revulsion, I scooted backwards and screamed, “No! Get away from me! Mommy!”

Linda looked at me a moment longer, then turned and went to her window. She opened it and reached her hands out towards the sky. All the box elder beetles that had been clinging to her body flew out into the night, leaving nothing of my sister behind. My twin was simply gone.

I told my parents and the police everything, but no one believed me. They concluded that my sister had been abducted that night and that my young mind was dealing with the trauma by constructing this story about beetles. I was in therapy until I learned to lie about my experience and pretend to heal. I never got over losing my twin, though. It hurt me to continue piano lessons in her absence, but my mother insisted that it would be good for me. I stopped going one day after I noticed that one of Old Lady Rose’s snow globes now contained a little girl holding a bright green beetle in her hand. I remained polite whenever I saw my ancient neighbor, but I could no longer bear to see all those snow globes and think about what they might mean.

To this day I regret turning my sister down when she offered me that bug. All it would have taken was just a swallow and we could have still been together. Every day I wish I could be made whole again. Every day I search for a bright green box elder beetle to take me away to wherever Linda is now.
