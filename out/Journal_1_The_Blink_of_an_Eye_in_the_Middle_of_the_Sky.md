**November 2nd- 11:38am:**

I woke up early to get myself ready for the day. I had a slight hangover from last night, so getting out of bed was a bit more complicated. Other than the constant pounding in my head, there was nothing new in my morning routine, nothing new in my day. It was simple. So what the hell happened?

It started when I decided to go to my boring-ass computer science class. I am in my second year of university, so the assignments are getting harder. The prof for this class is very dull and rigid to listen to. But Whatever. This doesn't matter. I can learn it by myself. 

Midway through the class, I felt a chill go up my spine. It felt weird and oddly timed. When I shrugged to relieve the pressure, I let out a yawn, blinked, and everything when silent...

 When I opened my eyes, the entire room was completely empty. Everyone was gone. There was no noise aside from the soft hum from the lights on the roof.

I panicked silently, thinking maybe I simply flaked out and woke up after class. But that doesn't make any sense. No matter where you are in this school, you can hear distant noises of people talking, laughing, running, etc. There was none of that. I could tell I was utterly alone. 

I've always been calm in challenging situations. I scanned my backpack and checked what I had on hand. I have no idea what is going on, so I could have been drugged for all I know. I collected my thoughts and got up. I took my stuff, packed it up, and left the lecture hall in the empty hallway.

I am writing this from the hallway now. The door closed behind me, locking in the process. I called out to whoever was in the room, but nothing was said. My plan is to walk to the door that leads outside. Once I get to it, I will write more. 

Disclaimer to anyone reading this. I am not dumb. I know what I am doing in most situations. This is unlike anything I have ever experienced. This is unlike anything I have heard of outside of Science fiction. I will document everything I see, hear, touch, and experience until I either figure out what is going on or am unable to keep reporting.

**November 2nd- 4:25 pm**

Update! The doors to the outside no longer exist. I have been walking down a hallway going North for the past five hours. The hallways seem to continue. There are branching hallways from the one I am in now. That being said, every single one of them looks longer than my university's hallways.

If I was to guess, I would have been going in this single direction for about twenty kilometres. My feet are beginning to hurt, but that is the least of my worries.

Every time I look behind me towards the area I came from, I swear I see a shadow slip into a classroom in the distance. I am not entirely confident in this claim I have made, but it feels very unusual. 

As I said in my previous entry, no other human exists in this area. I hear no noise aside from my footsteps and the lights. I haven't called out to anyone for fear that I am simply hallucinating, going to wake up at any moment. 

I can see this being a dream. This is very improbable and unlikely to be happening in reality. Nevertheless, I will continue documenting how this is continuing.

**November 2nd- 8:22pm**

I am afraid for my life.

I was vastly incorrect in my assumptions.

I am not at my school, that is certain. I am not on earth.. or at least my planet. I can decern that from the fact that I saw an open window. It looked normal enough. It overlooked one of the many courtyards that my school had. The most significant difference was not the yard's contents but the sky's contents. It was not cloudy, and there were no stars. I am positive that light pollution did not hide them either. There was nothing aside from the moon, and it was NOT my moon. My moon does not look like an eyeball bleeding red blood. I moved away from the window and ran down the hallway.

Also, I am not alone. I cannot express this enough. The shadow has gotten closer and is now within 10 metres of me every time I turn around. It is a humanoid about eight feet tall and has elongated arms and legs. With my little glance, I can see it has teeth, pure black eyes, no nose, and no hair or ears. Its eyes are bleeding red blood, and it holds a constant smile. I cannot stress this enough, it is not human.

All the doors are locked. I tried other classroom doors to no avail. I changed my direction several times and counted my steps to track how far I had gone in these hallways. I now understand that these are never-ending hallways. I have gone about twenty kilometres to the North, turned and went ten kilometres to the east, five more to the North, and twenty to the west. I have been jogging for the past hour to try and make up some distance.

I will make another entry in an hour or two. I will try to figure out as much as I can.

**November 3rd- 12:00am**

I have vastly misunderstood my situation. I will never escape this place, and I am disappointed that I just figured this out. I have a signal, and after this passage, I will attempt to put this on any social media platform I can.

The shadow's name is Daniel. I know you must have many questions, but I only have a few answers. Daniel is now behind me, reading over my shoulder until I turn around. When I turn around, he slips into the walls. He is smiling a crazed smile that is so much worse up close. I can feel his breath against the back of my neck, and I can tell I am utterly powerless against him.

About an hour ago, he spoke to me. It was a short few sentences, but they were enough to help me understand my situation here. The following are his exact words:

"I am Daniel. I am the watcher. I am hungry. You are sustenance."

He screamed into my ear immediately after his words were spoken, making me flinch in pain. When I turned around, his eyes were gone, completely black, and he slipped into the wall. 

I do not believe I will survive until morning, I am sure of this fact. I am truly sorry. I have made my peace and I am simply sitting down on the ground. This will end soon.

Goodbye.
