Hello. I’m Kushal, an undergrad from India.

I’ll start with what made me finally type this out.

When I’m back in my hometown, my mother and I go for walks. There’s a house on our route that we pass every time. My mom always reacts to it. She looked it and said :

*"I’d love to buy a home like that and live there*."

It became routine. I could almost predict the exact second she’d say it.

A few days ago, we were about to reach that house and the usual thought appeared in my mind.

*she’s going to say it again.*

We reached it. She looked right at the building. I watched her eyes move the same way they always do.

She said nothing.

There was no change in pace. She just kept walking with her mouth closed, as if the habit had never existed. After we passed it, she started talking normally about random things. Something felt wrong to me like a missing line in a script that everyone else thinks is complete.

  
A second example, because this one still pisses me off.

Last month I was walking back from college after it rained. The road was wet, dirty water everywhere, vehicles passing fast. I saw a bike coming up ahead, close enough that I could hear it properly. The moment I saw it, I thought

*"This bike is going to splash water on me"*

I moved away from the edge of the road.

The bike passed and ... Nothing happened. I even felt that stupid relief for a second.

Then a car hit a pothole and threw water so wide it reached the sidewalk anyway. I got drenched. Standing there soaked, the worst part wasn’t the water but what it suggested. My brain didn’t prevent the bad thing. It just dodged the version of it that I saw coming.

This wasn’t the first time something like this happened. These are just the cleanest examples because they’re simple.

For a long time, I blamed my last four years on plain bad luck. College started and everything went downhill. Bad timing, missed opportunities, random setbacks. Some good things happened too, but overall, it felt ugly.

Then I noticed a pattern that I wish I never did.

When I strongly expect a realistic event that could go either way, it tends to avoid the exact moment I’m waiting for. It doesn’t vanish from existence. It just slips away from my prediction. I tried timing it once and gave up. The delay changes. The only constant is that the moment I start expecting, the outcome stops lining up with what I pictured.

This doesn’t touch things I fully control. If I decide to raise my hand, I can do that freely. Crazy unrealistic thoughts also change nothing, because reality was never headed there anyway.

The trigger seems to be that middle zone. Like an event that could happen any second, and your brain starts leaning toward *“yeah, it’s about to happen.”*

I’m also a daydreamer. My head runs ahead of my life all the time. I imagine good things, conversations, messages, plans working out and here’s the part that scares me, the best moments I’ve had usually came when I didn’t picture them beforehand. They arrived from nowhere but the moment I start building a clear expectation, the moment starts acting… allergic to it.

I know what this sounds like. I know about confirmation bias. I know stress can wire your brain into seeing patterns where there are none. I’m not trying to win an argument against reality.

**I WANT THIS TO BE COINCIDENCE**

But there’s another part of me that I hate admitting. A part that wants the opposite, because if this is real, then maybe I can learn to use it. The logic is simple and it’s poison. If expecting good ruins it, then expecting bad might protect me. That thought changes you. You start practicing disaster in your head as a daily habit. You start pre-ruining your own life to **“help”** it. You start sounding negative even when you don’t mean to, because negativity becomes a tool.

I don’t want to become that person.

I could list a hundred examples, but that won’t prove anything. It’ll just make me look more obsessed, and honestly, I already feel obsessed. I’m writing this because I need a clean test that isn’t trapped inside my head.

I’m writing this post as my final test to see if my hypothesis is true.
