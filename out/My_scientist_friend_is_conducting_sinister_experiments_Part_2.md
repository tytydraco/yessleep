The stairs groaned under my feet as I descended into the suffocating darkness. The air was thick, cloying with the stench of mildew, decay, and something far worse. Each breath burned my lungs, as if the very air itself had been poisoned. My heart hammered in my chest, but all I could hear was the wet, muffled sound of my shoes slapping against the cold stone.

I dare you to try it sometime—standing on a staircase, knowing that the abyss below is worse than the monster behind you. It’s the kind of fear that digs into your bones and makes you second-guess everything. But I had no choice. I had to keep moving.

I dared a quick glance over my shoulder. The staircase was empty, but the echoes of Victor’s slow, methodical footsteps were unmistakable. It felt as if he were savoring the chase, the predator enjoying the hunt. He wasn’t rushing. Not yet. It was like he wanted to drag this out.

The further I descended, the colder it grew. A chill seeped into my bones, gnawing at my sanity. The walls were slick with moisture, dripping with a thick, black substance I didn’t want to question. And I know what you’re thinking: What could it possibly be? But trust me, you don’t want to know.

The dim overhead lights flickered erratically, casting grotesque, malformed shadows that twisted and distorted with every passing second.

Finally, I reached the bottom. The basement.

It was worse than I could have imagined. The room stretched far beyond what my eyes could make out in the faint light, filled with cages—large, rusted cages, their bars twisted and bent in ways that suggested they had once contained something alive, something that had fought for its freedom. Bloodstains marred the floor, dried in sickening patterns. And scattered throughout the room were glass jars filled with substances I could only describe as unnatural—thick, cloudy liquids with the occasional human-shaped mass floating within them. They seemed to shift in the light, as if alive, watching me.

And I’ll tell you something: Those jars? They weren’t just filled with liquid. Whatever was in them was alive. You could feel it. I didn’t need to look too closely. I didn’t want to know.

I stumbled back, my pulse quickening. This was Victor’s true laboratory. This was where his insanity had birthed the monstrosities I had witnessed in his twisted notes and fragmented journals.

My eyes darted to something else. A large metal door, tucked away at the far end of the basement, was slightly ajar. A sickly, flickering light streamed from behind it, casting a faint glow across the floor. It could be an exit. It had to be.

I sprinted toward it, my heart pounding in my chest like a drum. Every step felt heavier, as if the very house was trying to hold me back, keeping me within its clutches. Was this my escape, or another cruel trick Victor had set for me?

I reached the door, my hand trembling as I touched the cold, rusted handle. It didn’t turn. Something was blocking it. My stomach churned as I heard a faint, scraping sound from behind the door. Something was dragging itself across the floor—a low, gurgling noise that made my skin crawl.

I swallowed, forcing my mind to remain sharp. I had no choice but to move closer. My fingers brushed the door handle, turning it slowly, cautiously.

"Leaving so soon, Jonathan?"

The voice—Victor’s voice—cut through the silence like a knife. I spun around, my blood running cold. Victor stood there, his face twisted into an unholy grin. His eyes glowed in the dim light, gleaming with a maddening, almost affectionate amusement. He hadn’t been chasing me. He had been waiting.

"You really think you can just run away?" he taunted, his voice dripping with malevolent pleasure. "You are part of my experiment now, Jonathan. There is no escape. You will never leave."

I felt a tightness in my chest, the walls of the basement closing in on me. My mind raced—there had to be a way out. I had to get through that door.

In the dim light, I saw it—a shifting shadow, moving behind the metal door. It was too large, far too large to be human. For a split second, I thought I saw a familiar form—a human shape, but twisted and distorted, like something that had once been alive but was now deformed beyond recognition.

The door creaked open a fraction more, and my breath caught in my throat. It was coming out.

I didn’t have time to think. With a rush of adrenaline, I shoved against the door, pushing with all my strength, every muscle in my body screaming in protest. The door opened wider. And what came through... I would never forget.

It was tall. Far too tall. Its body was impossibly thin, limbs stretched at angles that defied the laws of nature. Its skin—if you could call it skin—was stretched taut, a translucent membrane that clung to its bones, giving it the appearance of a malnourished, corpse-like figure. Its eyes were black holes—hollow, infinite voids that seemed to suck in all the light around them.

Its mouth—it was wrong. So wrong. It split open, impossibly wide, revealing row upon row of jagged, broken teeth that jutted out in unnatural directions. Its tongue flicked in and out, dripping with thick, black saliva that fell to the floor like oil. And the smell—it hit me in a wave, the stench of rot, of decay, of something far too ancient for me to comprehend.

I stepped back, my legs trembling beneath me, too paralyzed by fear to run. I couldn’t look away. The creature moved forward, its limbs jerking unnaturally, as if they were not meant to bend that way. The sound it made—it was like fingernails scraping against glass, a screech that pierced through my skull, leaving me dizzy, nauseous.

But then I heard it—a bang.

A loud bang.

The creature shrieked, its body convulsing violently as if reacting to something beyond its control. The metal door slammed shut behind it, trapping it inside, but the noise only grew louder. The air crackled with energy, and the room seemed to pulse with a sickly, malevolent life of its own.

"Victor!"

A voice, sharp and full of authority, cut through the chaos. A figure appeared from the shadows, tall and ragged, his face bruised, gaunt, but sharp with a strange determination. He was holding a crowbar, his grip tight.

"Do you have any idea what you’ve done?" the man shouted at Victor, his voice hoarse but filled with an urgency that shook me to my core.

Victor’s face twisted in a mixture of shock and rage. "You! I thought you were—"

The man didn’t give him a chance to finish. With a swift, powerful motion, he swung the crowbar into one of the machines near the back of the room. Sparks flew, illuminating the basement in flashes of bright, violent light. For a moment, everything went still.

The creature screeched again, its voice building into an agonizing crescendo. I stumbled back, nearly losing my footing, but then—I saw it. The creature was moving toward us, dragging its horrid, malformed body closer, faster, with every passing second.

Victor’s voice broke through the rising noise. "You’re insane!" he shouted at the man. "You’re going to kill us all!"

The man didn’t respond. He only looked at me, his eyes locking onto mine with a frantic, wild urgency. "We don’t have much time," he said. "You have to leave. Now."

Before I could even process his words, the creature reached the doorway. It lunged—its jaws snapped open like a trap, its teeth glistening with a grotesque hunger. A rancid breath poured from its mouth, splattering the floor with thick, black saliva.

The man shoved me toward the stairs. "Go! Run!" he yelled.

I didn’t hesitate. I turned and bolted up the stairs, my legs barely able to carry me, my heart slamming in my chest. I heard the sounds of battle behind me—the sickening wet thud of flesh hitting metal, a bone-chilling scream. But I didn’t dare look back.

I reached the top, gasping for air, but there was no escape. The door to the outside was still ahead, but... something was wrong.

A heavy, wet thud shook the door from the other side. It groaned under pressure. Something—someone—was pushing against it.

Victor’s voice came from the other side, frantic and full of rage. "You can’t escape, Jonathan!" he screamed. "You think you can leave me? After all I’ve done for you?"

I froze.

Then, behind him—beyond the door—I heard it.

The dragging. The gurgling.

The thing was still coming.

And it was hungry.

Suddenly, the door exploded open. The creature stood before me. Its eyes locked onto mine, its mouth parting to reveal its teeth, slick with blood and saliva. And then, from somewhere behind it, I heard a voice—a voice I hadn’t expected.

"Run!"

It was the man—the stranger who had helped me. But it was too late. The creature lunged.

And with it, my world went black.

Darkness swallowed me.

For a long time, there was nothing. No sound, no movement. Just an empty, suffocating void. But slowly—too slowly—my senses returned. First, the pain. A dull, aching throb in my skull, radiating through my body like I had been tossed down a flight of stairs.

(Which, to be fair, might have actually happened.)

Then came the cold. It gnawed at my skin, settling into my bones, the kind of chill that never really leaves. I wasn’t lying on concrete anymore. The floor beneath me was damp, uneven. Dirt. I could taste it in the air—earthy, metallic, tinged with something rotten.

I wasn’t dead.

Yet.

I pried my eyes open. It was dim—too dim to see clearly—but I could make out the silhouette of jagged stone walls stretching upward into a ceiling I couldn’t see. The air was thick, heavy, and damp, filled with the distant sound of dripping water. A cave? A tunnel?

I pushed myself up, groaning as every muscle in my body screamed in protest. My hands pressed into the dirt, and my fingers brushed against something rough. A rope. No, not rope—twisted, fibrous strands that pulsed slightly under my fingertips. I recoiled, my breath catching in my throat.

What the hell was that?

Then I heard it.

Breathing.

Not mine.

I wasn’t alone.

I twisted around too fast, my vision spinning for a second before focusing on the figure a few feet away. A man. He sat slumped against the cave wall, barely conscious, his face partially obscured by the shadows. His clothes were torn, streaked with dirt and something darker. Blood.

His head lolled forward, but as I shifted, his body tensed. His eyes snapped open.

For a second, neither of us moved.

Then, with a voice hoarse and raw, he rasped, "You're alive."

I blinked. "Yeah. Barely."

His eyes flicked past me, toward the tunnel stretching into darkness. "Then we need to move."

I hesitated. "Who—?"

He cut me off. "No time. If we stay here, it will find us."

A sharp chill crawled down my spine. It.

I didn’t need to ask what he meant.

The last thing I remembered before blacking out was that thing lunging at me. Its hollow, black eyes. Its gaping maw lined with jagged teeth.

I should have been dead.

Instead, I was here. And so was this guy.

I pushed myself to my feet, swaying slightly. "Where the hell is here?"

The man let out a dry, humorless chuckle. "You think I know?" He shifted, wincing as he moved his leg. "Woke up about ten minutes ago. Thought I was alone until you started mumbling in your sleep."

Great. At least I hadn’t been talking about anything embarrassing. Like how much I wanted to not die in a monster-infested murder cave.

I eyed him warily. He wasn’t Victor. That much was clear. His face was gaunt, his beard scruffy, but there was something sharp in his gaze. He wasn’t just some random prisoner. He had survived down here.

"Who are you?" I asked.

He exhaled slowly. "Alex." A pause. "And you?"

"Jonathan."

He nodded, then glanced down the tunnel again. His jaw tightened. "We need to go. Now."

I hesitated. "What's coming?"

He didn’t answer right away. Instead, he lifted his arm and pulled back the shredded fabric of his sleeve. His skin was covered in deep, raw scratches—long, uneven gashes that looked more like something had grown out of him rather than clawed him.

"They don’t kill you right away," he said quietly. "They change you."

A deep, sinking dread settled in my gut.

I didn’t ask who they were.

Because I had a horrible feeling I already knew.

From deep within the tunnel, a sound echoed toward us.

A wet, dragging sound.

Gurgling.

Alex’s eyes locked onto mine.

"Run."

So we ran. Adam was slightly faster than me, bolting toward the exit. However, a daunting realisation had hit me, something was grasping onto my foot.

I had been caught.
