For the past, what it feels like 200 years, I've been stuck in a paradox. I can't explain why it's been happening to me. I get birthed by the same mother each time it resets. As I grow up I do something new, I try investing in bitcoin and becoming rich thinking that it's the key to escape, it didn't work. I tried becoming happy in one life and getting a decent job. Didn't work either. Chaos started to ensue. I gingerly await my demise. I tried killing myself to escape. It never worked, I tried so many times with different methods. Burning, stabbing, shooting, suicide by firing squad, ripping out my own organs, draining all my blood, etcetera. 

I started to notice something horrifying near my birthday each time it passes. A munci looking creature stares at me from a dark corner, it has dark black eyes with pure white irises, crimson red liquid which I can assume is blood dripping down its eyes and head. I try to ignore it but I see it in my peripheral vision, glancing down at me. Just recently, I tried to run over to it and punch it, when I do, it vanishes. In another setting in the paradox I warned everyone of it, no one listened. They looked at me like I shoved their dead dog in a box and shipped it to them. I was close to doing it as well. I was desperately waiting to meet my end, but it didn't come. I went to Paris with my wife and stood on top of the eiffle tower, I glanced down to see it, it was there. I started to realize something, it was there every reset. It was stalking me ever since I got trapped in this paradox. 

I try and avoid it but it always finds a way. I try and calm down, take a shower maybe and relieve my stress. When I exited the shower and looked in the mirror I finally figure out what it is. It was me. It was me when I escaped. When I tried to communicate with it, it kept on disappearing, I now know why. The paradox is trying to kill me to keep me inside. I bastardized the one thing that can help me escape from this blood stained bastile. I walk over to the tundra of Alaska to see a rift. The exit of the paradox. Then, it appeared,  right in front of it. 
"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT FROM ME?"
I yelled at it. I stepped back and it started chasing me. It launched itself on me and bit parts of my body off with its sharp blood stained teeth. I saw chunks on my guts being spewed everywhere, fractions of the intestines changing the color of the snow. With the little muscle I had, I charge for the rift. Half my body got in when it latched onto me. It was desperately trying to pull me back in. With the little time I had, I started ripping my intestine out, it hurt like hell. I finally got it out and  hit the demon with it. It couldn't hang on and sent me flying to the other side. 

I escaped, I see scratches and bruises with blood on them. I clip in my kid body. Surrounded by paramedics, it was all over. I was more than overjoyed. I noclip out of reality. I was met by the demon itself. Face to face. I start whimpering. I didn't escape. 

"I can't believe you escaped, no one has been able to. Please, never come back. You got trapped because you noclipped out of reality, like the backrooms." 
I suddenly get a sharp electric feeling and clip back in reality, I realize that everything was real. 


I was finally free.
