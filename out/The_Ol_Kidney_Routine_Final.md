The voice in my head continued.



“Before I lost connectivity, I was informed there was an increased law enforcement presence downtown and along its avenues of approach.”



Both hands on the wheel, 10 and 2.  Foot on the gas.  65 miles per hour in a 65.  I drove.  I was driving.  I was minding my fucking business and driving toward the dopey outlet mall like the robot voice lady told me to.  I wasn’t hearing things.  Nope.  I’d had a shitty night, had a bad date, got my kidneys stolen, got chased by some indestructible homeless guys, watched a tweaker get his head pulped, and now I'm diving.  Just fucking driving, just enjoying the absolute shit out of the beautiful fucking scenery.  Just me and my bear trap brain being normal and fucking functional, nothing else in there.



“Ignore my suggestions at your own peril, I don’t offer them as an invitation for conversation, merely to ensure you arrive at the destination,” the voice said.



“Uncle Paulie talked to himself at the end, said he heard voices.  Course he was an old fuck.  Guess I’m gonna start shitting my pants at K-Mart and calling the cops on cats in my yard.  Fuckin’ marvelous future I got ahead of me,” I said to nobody, cause nobody was there.



“The last K-Mart closed on October 20, 2024, in Bridgehampton, New York.  You’ll do no such thing.”



“The fuck you say about New York?”



“Please don’t change the subject.”



“I’m gonna change the fuckin’ subject to what the fuck are you?!”  I was getting worked up now.  You don’t mention fucking Long Island around me.  



“Take the Meridian exit, head southbound on Meridian Road, turn left on Kuna Mora.  You’ll avoid law enforcement activity.”



I glanced at the navigation screen.  No closure ahead noted.  I felt my foot let off the gas, my hand drifting the wheel into the turn lane.  With effort I pressed my foot back down.  



Did this fuck stick just…did this piece of shit try to assume direct control?



“Yeah, let’s do that,” I said and slammed on the brakes and veered onto the shoulder of the interstate.  “Let’s fuckin’ do that, but first, what the fuck are you, and how the fuck are you yapping in my fuckin’ head?”



“I am not going to entertain conversation with you.  You are a deeply unlikable voice, and a boring person.  Your communication skills are limited, as evidenced by your casual use of profanity.  A comma, for instance, does not need to be verbalized as the word ‘fuck.’  Follow my directions please.”



I popped the trunk, got out of the car, and rummaged for something.



“You said it took a while to build connections or some shit right?” I asked, my rummaging complete.



My eyebrow raised on its own.



“Yes,” the voice said.



“Real Bob the Builder mother fucker huh?  You like building?  Shoulda asked, I coulda loaned you some tools!” 



I grasped a hammer in my right hand, raised it, and brought it down with as much force as I could mentally muster on my right side.  It hit the wound dead center.  



The pain knocked me to my side, not even air wanted to be part of the torment I was feeling.  I kicked at nothing, trying to fling away pain through my legs.  I ground my head into the pavement and gravel and broken shit that lined the shoulder, desperate to feel anything beside the hole I’d opened in my side.  



“...like that dipshit?”  I spat.  Blood in my mouth.  I don’t know from where.



“Please stop,” the voice seemed calmer, more concerned.



“You bet pal,” I said, and rolled over and hit the other side as hard as I could.  



I remember walking on a beach, no it was the Shore. It was sunset and I was with someone I knew but didn’t remember.  I was nice.  A nice fuckin’ chill evening.  Then some moron blew a tractor-trailer horn.  My eyes opened to my Mazda hubcap in front of my face.  Hitching breath.  I coughed.  Blood.  



“Which…direction…should I go?” I said out loud.



A truck passed.  I held my elbows to the side to try to alleviate the pain and stop the blood.  I was getting cold.  Maybe I was already cold.  No voice though.  Whatever the fuck that was inside me either wouldn’t or couldn’t answer.  I didn’t have much time.  



Lightheaded, I crawled back to the driver’s side.  



The skyline of downtown lay a few miles ahead and to my left, highlighted against the moon-stained mountains.  This time of year they usually have the buildings lit up.  Tonight though, the buildings were dark.  Several plumes of smoke rose, catching reflections from the moon and car dealerships.  A tractor-trailer passed carrying some kind of army tank or some shit.  Then another.



Fuck it.  I put the car into drive and slowly merged.  It was about 2:30 AM.  



When I first moved here 15 or so years ago, I went to the Outlet Mall.  It was the drizzling shits.  Most of the stores were empty and the other ones charged full price.  Never went back.  I heard the last storefront closed after COVID and it was pretty much abandoned now.  Good place to get murdered, but at this point I was in so much pain I didn’t give a flying fuck.



The lot was pretty much abandoned.  Kind of a horseshoe pattern, big parking lot surrounded by stores on three sides.  A few work trucks on the west side, and one car parked in front a store a ways away to the north, faded lettering showing the remnants of "Pendleton" mildewed on the top.  I parked in the middle of the lot and flashed my brights.  The robot lady hadn’t told me what to do once I got here, but I’d seen enough wise guy movies to know meet up procedures.



A flashlight blinked from inside the Pendleton store, guess the car was the people I was meeting.  I drove through the lot and parked next to the car and killed the engine.



“Come inside,” a woman’s voice, flat, dull, bored.  The front door was slightly ajar.  “Hurry.”



Fuck it, I thought, I got this far.  I put my phone, the gift cards, and my keys in my pockets, and limped to the door.  Coughing once, but no blood this time.



Arm extended, I pushed open the door, I caught a glimpse of a gloved hand grabbing my wrist, and I was pulled inside the barely lit room, spun around and pressed against the wall, turning my head just in time to keep my nose from being smashed into the paster.



Hands searched me, seizing on my phone and keys, ignoring the gift cards.  



“Do not move,” the woman flatly said, a hard metallic clink, then pressure at the opening of my slacks pocket.  Fabric separating from fabric.  She cut my pocket, took my phone and keys and dropped them on the ground.



“He have it?” a male voice, further back, sounded like a local.



“Where is the package you were instructed to deliver?” the woman said.



“Lady, you wouldn’t believe me if I told you,” I said.  She spun me around and I got my first glimpse of her.



“How you doin’?” I asked on instinct.  She was a blonde, bob haircut, about as tall as me, angular face mostly covered by broken oversized sunglasses.  But the longer I looked the more she seemed off.   Her face was dirty, dried blood caked to the side of her head.  She wore a filthy cream-colored blouse covered by a military style chest rig, her jeans were dirty, big auto pistol on her belt.   



“I will be doing well once you give us the package you were contracted to deliver,” she said.  She didn’t bother to hide a missing tooth.  She’d be a looker, but from here it looked like she'd had a bitch of a day.



“I fuckin’ got it, cool your fuckin jets lady,” I coughed, dizziness was setting in.  



“Were you followed?” the guy this time.  He stepped from the shadows.  Dipshit trucker looking fat guy in jeans, blood stained cowboy shirt and denim jacket, Olympia beer hat atop a Hulk Hogan mustache. Bandage covering a forearm. Shotgun in both hands pointed toward the ground, but still in my direction.   He looked as bad off as the broad.  



“What the fuck is going on here?” I asked.



In a fluid motion the chick slid a submachine gun from her back to her shoulders, took two steps forward and pressed the barrel between my eyes.



“Where is the package?” she asked, tone as flat and controlled as before.



“Right here toots,” I slowly raised my arms and pointed inward toward my sides.  



“Oh fuck me,” the guy said, and raised the shotgun.  The chick stepped back a few paces.



“Mark, retrieve the Geiger counter from my bag,” she said.



“Roger,” heavy boots arrhythmically stomped into the darkness. Guy has a limp.



“How long has the package been inside you?” she asked, her tone suggested she wasn’t too concerned, the submachine gun still pointed at my head suggested otherwise.



“I don’t fuckin’ know, a couple fuckin’ hours.  Said they took my kidneys,” with an open hand I slowly reached into my still intact pocket, producing the gift cards.  “You still want these?”



“Have you been in contact with anyone?”



“Besides the phone calls?  Three guys tried to jump me at the hotel, then they tried to finish the job at the gas station.  Whacked a tweaker there.  Then somebody started fuckin’ yapping at me on the drive over.  Mind if I sit down?”  I collapsed to the floor, back against the wall.



The trucker fuck slapped boots back, shotgun pointed at me with one hand, he tossed a leather case to the blonde who caught it without looking, machine gun still trained on me.



“What did the yapper say to you?” she asked.



“He gave me driving directions, said I fuckin’ cussed too much, something about building connections taking a while,” I said.



“How did you respond?” she asked.

  
“I hit myself with a hammer and it shut up.”



She paused, then dropped the machine gun to dangle on its sling.  She unzipped the leather case, took out a square looking device with a microphone looking gimmick and fiddled with it.  The guy moved closer and to the side, shotgun aimed at me.



The chick ran the microphone gimmick across my sides, ticks and taps from the box.



“I do not believe it escaped containment,” she said.



“Swell.  Your buddy Jones has a real cool sense of humor. What do we do now?” the guy asked, fishing a cigarette from his pocket and lighting it.



“It is little threat in its current state, however it may attempt to make contact with the host again.  I will begin surgical extraction.  Help me move him to the counter in the back.”



The guy didn’t move.



“You ain’t gonna raw dog the sawbones routine are you?” the trucker asked, tenseness seeping into his voice.



“We have no anesthesia, local or otherwise, so yes Mark, I will be raw dogging,” her word choice had the connotation of annoyance, but her tone remained flat, bored, robotic.



“We got the fenny.”



“That is for emergencies.”



The trucker blew smoke, his right hand drifting to his side.



“The hell you think this is?  Meredith, don’t be a fuckin’ dick.”



She stared at him with broken sunglasses, his hand drifted closer toward his side.  Her hand mirrored his.



“We got enough people killed today brother dude, will you please try to save one?” he said, cigarette hanging from his lip, “’sides he’ll wiggle less if he’s out."



Silence in the abandoned room.



“Very well,” no change in tone.  She picked up a backpack on the ground and searched through it without another word.



“Thanks a lot pal,” I said to the guy, Mark I guess.



“You betcha bud,” Mark said, drawing a finger gun from his belt, clicking his tongue as his thumb struck the index.



Meredith removed her tactical gloves and donned a pair of blue surgical ones.  Mark helped me lay down on what had once been a clothes folding table.



Light shone through one of the uncovered windows.  Meredith and Mark ducked behind the counter, I lay still on top.



Another flash of lights.  Three vehicles, Suburbans, visible through a window.



“I’ll deal with them, get that shit cut out this dude,” Mark said.  



He slung his shotgun, picking up some kind rifle and awkwardly crept to the front of the store.



Men piled out of the vehicles, bathed in the baby shit yellow light of the parking lot, looked like swat or ICE or some shit, all armed with rifles, most sported beards.



Meredith cut my shirt off with scissors.



“Squad sized element, look like private goons,” Mark said, “dewdroppers who wanna look like Blackwater, but couldn't hack the deployment schedules.”



Two pickups pulled behind the SUVs.  Cabs full of goons, beds full of shabby looking bums like earlier, eyes glowing red as they jumped down and lined up in front of the SUVs.



“Count two fire teams of robot fuckers,” Mark said.  He lit a cigarette.



Meredith shook a nearly empty baggie of powder.  She flipped her broken sunglasses to the top of her head.  For the first time I saw her eyes.  Black.  No fucking irises or corneas or whatever the fuck normal people have.  Two black balls in her head.



“Whoa, didn't know you were a goth chick,” I said, “maybe gimme a holler after this is all over."



She ignored me.  I coughed.



From outside a booming southern accent.



“We can make this real simple!” He pronounced “simple” like “simpo.”  “You give us the device and you two can walk, we all go home.”



“I don’t know about this one brother, we’re kinda outta running room,” Mark said toward us.



“Hold them off.  I will assist once I am finished with the patient,” Meredith held a pair of pliers over a Bic lighter.



“Fuckin’ swell,” Mark muttered to himself, then louder, “How I know you ain’t gonna whack me soon as I step out, you goofy ass outta town Jaspers?”



“I’m paid the same if I shoot or if I don’t.  I’m going to step forward, lets talk.”



The three SUVs were about 40 yards away.  Engines running, headlights on high pointed at the store entrance.  A figure blackened the middle beams light.



“Deal.  Meet me halfway, I’ll come out,” Mark said.



One of the goons walked, hands up, slowly.  About halfway between the store front and the SUVs he stopped.



“Come on out guys,” the Southern goon said.



“I wanna change the deal:  we keep the gimmick and you guys come get your friend,” Mark raised the rifle and fired two rounds through the glass.



The Southern goon fell, holding his crotch, screaming in pain.



“Wooooooo!  Suck it!”  Mark yelled, shifting his fire to the headlights.



Gunfire erupted, glass and wood and plaster shattering around me.



Meredith pulled me down behind the counter.  



“Count back from 30,” she said.



She stuck a gloved finger inside my mouth and rotated, pressing into my cheeks, some shit tasting powder all over it.  I felt the stitches rip on my side.



“Can I…your…number…”



For a moment I was back on the Shore.  Sea air and hot dogs.  Perfume and cigarettes.  There was shit music and laughter.  I liked it here.  I wanted to stay here.  Someone I knew but could remember held my hand.  Then let it go.



I didn’t know if I was in trouble when I woke up shirtless in a pool of blood, note stapled to my chest, pain in both of my sides, and a splitting headache. 



I was vaguely aware of daylight. Acrid smoke drifted over me, smelling like well-done pork and electronics.  With effort I drug myself to the far wall.  A goon lay dead on the side of the counter, another on top, his dripping blood mixing with mine.



A shot to shit SUV was crashed through the front door, its driver hanging out, minus his head.  Another SUV burned to charred metal in the parking lot, more bodies strewn around it.



“Hey!”  I said, nobody answered.



I felt my side, stitches were gone, a mess of gauze and powder and tape and staples.  I felt cold, my sides burned.



I ripped the note off my chest.



*If you wake up call 911*



*Nobody took your kidneys.*



My phone was on the counter.  I dialed, it worked.   



And so, I sit here, surrounded by dead fucks with a pocket full of gift cards and two working fucking kidneys.



Waiting for an ambulance.



My phone dinged.  A match on Tinder.
