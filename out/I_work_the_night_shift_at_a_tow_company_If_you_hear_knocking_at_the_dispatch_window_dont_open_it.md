This job wasn’t supposed to be complicated.

After a breakdown at my last job, I needed something quiet. Something I could handle. Working nights alone at a dispatch center seemed like a good idea at the time. It was just me, a phone, and a system called PulsePoint that let me track drivers, assign calls, and upload information from the road. The hardest part was supposed to be staying awake.

But then Carl retired. And he left me a list.

Carl worked here for forty years. Quiet guy. Didn’t say much unless it was worth saying. Everyone respected him, even if they didn’t always understand him. When I came in for my second solo night, I found his name in my inbox.

*He didn’t say goodbye. Didn’t write a long message. Just a list.*

I thought it was a joke. Something he left behind to mess with the new kid. But that first rule had me sweating. I’d gotten a call the night before from a woman crying about a wreck on the highway. She said her husband wasn’t breathing. We sent someone, but there was nothing there. Just an empty stretch of I-66.

I started watching the clock a little closer.

Around two fifty-five, I went to the bathroom. When I came back, the GPS glitched for a split second. A blank screen, just like in the list.

Then I heard it.

A knock.

Soft. Measured. Right behind me at the dispatch window. The one that looks out into the dark lot. I didn’t turn around at first. Told myself it was nothing. Could’ve been the building settling. Or the wind. Or a tree branch.

Then it knocked again. Louder this time.

I turned. Looked at the window. Nothing there. Just my reflection.

I pulled up the camera feed. It showed the same thing. Just darkness outside.

The third knock came while I was looking away. Then, clear as day, I heard it.

"Rachel..."

My name.

That was enough to make me grab my phone.

**Me:** Tyler, where are you?  
**Tyler:** Wreck on Route 7. Fifteen minutes out. Why, what’s up?

That’s when I knew it wasn’t him. It wasn’t anyone from the company.

I stayed in my chair. Didn’t move. Didn’t speak. Just stared at the screen until the lights in the building buzzed once, then settled.

At exactly 3:00 a.m., a new email popped up. No subject, just a single line from Carl.

*You can look all you want. They’re not really there. Not yet.*

I didn’t move until the morning shift walked in. They found me still at my desk, eyes locked on the window.

Tyler had been in sometime after four. Left me a drink and a note that said he didn’t want to bother me. Figured I needed some space.

He never knocked.

So whatever did... it’s still out there.

And the window is still right behind me.

Tonight is another shift. Ill let you know if anything happens.

But I have to wonder.

What happens if someone breaks them?
