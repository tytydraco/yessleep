Over the next few weeks, I became more focused and determined than ever. I followed the rules meticulously, completing my tasks with precision and keeping a wary eye on anything unusual. It was then that I truly understood why the other employees on the floor all behaved in a similar manner.

Everyone was doing their best to conserve their energy, moving through their tasks with a quiet, almost mechanical efficiency. They consciously tried to avoid stressful situations that could lead to unnecessary energy expenditure, especially during the Task Hour.

But that was easier said than done because the Task Hour was designed to activate those triggers—but that didn’t mean you shouldn’t try. Keeping your heartbeat steady was a key ingredient for long-term survival at Twilight Trust.

It also became clear why friendships were scarce and confiding in one another was avoided—emotional attachments could become liabilities if someone ended up in a bad situation at the workplace.

It could happen today, tomorrow, or even two months from now; you never know.

So, 'every man for himself' seemed to be the unspoken mantra going around.

However, as I moved into my eighth and final week at the company, the paranoia began to take hold. I found myself constantly glancing over my shoulder, feeling the weight of unseen eyes, which made me double-check and triple-check everything.

The tension mounted with each passing day, as if I was bracing for an unseen blow that would force me to start all over again. With only three days left on my notice, my heart nearly stopped when I saw Mortimer ambling around my office as I returned from the restroom.

He was holding a file in his hand and flashed a weird smile as he walked past me. I wasn’t sure if he had stopped by my office or was simply attending to some other work. I immediately rushed to my desk and started checking if everything was in place.

The red cord with my name printed on it was where it was supposed to be. The cinnamon powder sprinkled around the entrance was undisturbed. The portrait on the wall, the filing cabinet, the glass of water and the leather-bound journal—everything was in its place. Even the cuckoo clock was ticking away, its time in sync with both my watch and the system.

But then my gaze landed on the little figurine. It had been moved. It was supposed to be facing me during the shift, but now it was slightly turned to face the computer.

 “You sneaky little bugger,” I muttered under my breath, cursing Mortimer with a few choice words. I carefully moved the figurine back to its correct position and slowly sat down, double-checking everything again for my own peace of mind.

Finally, I glanced at the clock—it had just turned 11:20 PM. Taking a deep breath, I regained my composure, took command of my station, and resumed taking calls.

After processing over 20 calls, I took a moment to stretch and glanced at the clock again. It read 11:45. My eyes immediately shifted to the new call flashing on my screen awaiting my attention.

 “These things don’t stop do they? I’ll just take a couple more before getting ready for Task Hour” I sighed to myself. I hit connect and answered the call.

 “Welcome to Twilight Trust. This is Ryan. How can I assist you today?” I asked, speaking into the microphone.

“Good evening. My name is Gavin, I am looking to open an account for myself.”

“Certainly sir. Can I have your full name please?” I responded

“Gavin…… Jeremiah…… Lockwood.”

I suddenly froze as I felt the blood drain from my face. That was supposed to be my full name.

My mind raced as I struggled to maintain my composure. “Could you please repeat that?” I asked, trying to steady my voice.

“Gavin Jeremiah Lockwood,” the caller responded calmly.

I took a deep breath and forced myself to focus. “Thank you, Mr. Lockwood. Could you please provide your date of birth and place of residence?”

There was a brief pause on the other end, and then the caller responded, “April 14th, 1999. 425 Evergreen Terrace”

A cold sweat formed on my brow as I stared at the screen, not only because he had just recited my exact details—down to the address where I grew up, but also due to my realization that a timer had activated on screen. Meanwhile the time on the system clock showed 12:01 AM.

The Task Hour had just been initiated without my knowledge, and now I can’t disconnect until the timer runs its course.

With my heart pounding away in my chest, my eyes slowly gazed towards the cuckoo clock on the wall. The bird didn’t come out and chime this time. Instead the clock hands simply pointed at 11:50 PM. Clearly the clock had stopped working some time ago.

“Perhaps you should check the bin next to you…” I heard the voice speak softly from the other end, as if volunteering himself to clear the confusion.

I hesitated for a moment but knelt down to retrieve the bin placed below my desk, wondering what I would find inside. As I rummaged through it,  I pulled out the discarded wrapper of a pack of two red batteries that I had removed at the start of the shift. But to my horror, the very same red batteries were still inside the bin, as if I had never used them.

Alongside them was another wrapper for two blue batteries, which I had never seen before. That’s when it hit me—Mortimer had switched the batteries while I was on my break. Moving the figurine had been a distraction, a sleight of hand to cover up the real deception!

 “Who are you? What do you want with me? And why are you  calling me using my name?” I finally demanded, desperately trying to keep the fear from seeping into my voice.

The line crackled briefly before the voice on the other end responded, smooth and composed. “Hello Gavin, I am Mr. Ernie Finch, the CEO of Twilight Trust.”

“Do you see that figurine near your computer?” he continued. “I’m the same man—or at least, I used to be…” His voice trailed off, distant and reflective, as if lost in memories of a different time.

“What do you want with me?” I finally asked, struggling to keep my mounting frustration in check.

“Come on, Gavin. I want you to continue working for me. I’ve been impressed with your performance these past few weeks, and I think you’re becoming a valuable part of Twilight Trust. Why else do you think we’re having this conversation?”

“Why did you call using my name?” I asked again, more insistent this time.

“Well, Gavin, I like to think of myself as someone who truly cares about his employees. So, I make an effort to step into their shoes—to live a day or two in their world, so that I can understand them better.”

“I believe it helps me connect with them on a deeper level, giving me a unique insight into their lives.”

“Wait, what?” I stammered, leaning forward in my chair. “What exactly do you mean by that?” I asked, as a cold dread started creeping up my spine.

“Why don’t you find out for yourself?” the voice suggested smoothly. “Go and check your folder in the filing cabinet.

“Go on Gavin, it’s the Task Hour after all,” he added, as I deliberated on it.

I approached the cabinet slowly, dragging my feet, uncertain of what I would find. With a quick motion, I opened the cabinet and removed my file. This time it looked and felt different.

Opening the file, I was surprised to discover that all the previous task-related documents were gone. In their place was a single iPad. My heart raced as I hurried back to my seat and powered it on. The screen flickered to life, displaying only one app—no labels, just a pulsating icon.

With a deep breath, I tapped it and it opened a folder that contained many videos and photographs. They were infrared images of my home, both inside and out. I saw pictures of my brother and sister sleeping soundly at night, completely unaware of the intrusion. My blood ran cold as I stared at the photos, feeling utterly helpless.

I clicked on the videos and immediately saw Mr. Finch for the first time, standing outside my house. He was a tall man, around 6'5", his figure clearly visible with his back to the camera. He wore a utility belt around his waist, just like the one Mortimer wears at the bank.

As he turned to face the camera, he adjusted a knob on his belt and began to slowly dissolve into the air. He would have been almost invisible, except for a faint outline the camera managed to capture in the grainy footage.

Finch then entered my home with his camera and found my sister Kylie asleep on the couch in the living room. He dropped a small rock on the floor, jolting her awake. She immediately pulled out a kitchen knife from under her pillow, her face pale with fear as she waved it around aimlessly. But Finch was already behind her, spraying a solution from a bottle he carried. Kylie slowly sank back into the couch, gradually losing consciousness.

He then carried the camera with him as he toured my home, carefully looking at the photographs on the wall of my family, including the ones with mom and dad.

Next, he entered my room and started going through my belongings, eventually moving into the bathroom. He took my toothbrush and began brushing his own teeth.

Clearly, the CEO of Twilight Trust had no concept of personal space or oral hygiene.

Mr Finch then found my box of journals that I had kept stashed under the floorboard in my cupboard. He lay down on my bed and started reading them, one by one.

The next video showed him bent over, rummaging through the refrigerator and slowly pulling out ingredients. I watched as he prepared sandwiches in the kitchen while my sister remained fast asleep on the nearby couch. He neatly packed the sandwiches into bags and placed them on the kitchen table.

Then, he sat next to Kylie on the couch and leaned back on the cushions to relax. My jaw dropped as I watched myself enter the house 20 minutes later, waking Kylie up while Mr. Finch simply watched, seated just a couple of feet away.

He observed from the side-lines as I moved from room to room, packing their bags. Mr. Finch even stood next to me on the lawn, waving alongside me as Kevin and Kylie climbed aboard the school bus.

I finally switched off the tablet; I didn’t need to watch anymore. I was already sick to my stomach. They had been watching me, tracking my every move, and now it was all being laid out in front of me.

 “What now?” I asked bluntly, feeling the anger rise in my chest. “Is this how you are going to get me to work for you? By indirectly threatening to bring harm to my family?”

The line crackled with a chilling silence before Mr. Finch’s voice returned, smooth and unbothered.

“Well, I hope it doesn’t have to come to that Gavin. It’s not like your hands are tied, and you don’t have a way out of here.”

“Are the conditions a little hard to follow?” Yes, maybe.

“Is there a bit of subterfuge going on here and there? Also yes.

“But you can still make it out of here in one piece, Gavin. You saw that happen on the very first day you joined here, when Mrs Malone won her freedom. You do remember that right?”

“So what makes you think you can’t do the same?” Mr Finch asked me, in a matter of fact manner.

“At what cost Mr Finch? You want me to give away my youth for this place?” I asked exasperated.

“Just a bit of it, yes, but how much we take is entirely up to you,” Finch chimed in trying to sound reasonable.

My voice faltered as I lowered my head, feeling my shoulders slump in resignation. With no clear escape in sight, I finally looked up and asked, “What is the point of all this, Mr. Finch? What exactly are you trying to achieve?”

“Aah Gavin, I am glad you asked. But first let’s take a detour and delve into my own personal life before we can get back to answering your question. Trust me, you would be wise to hear me out. I think this will help you out in the long run.

As he spoke, my eyes drifted to the timer on the screen—less than 7 minutes remained. I shuddered, wondering what awaited me as the clock ticked down.

“You see Gavin, in another lifetime I used to run a thriving casino business in Vegas which made me a very wealthy man. One crucial aspect of my success which made me stand apart from my competitors was my understanding of the human psyche” Mr. Finch continued, his voice laced with a mix of pride and nostalgia. "I knew how to tap into their deepest desires, fears, and motivations of people.”

While others focused on the surface - offering flashy lights and big payouts—I devised methods to make patrons stay longer at the casino, to feel as if they were on an endless vacation. From incorporating structural changes on the gaming floor to releasing pheromones and exotic scents into the atmosphere, I pioneered techniques that are now standard in the industry.”

“I brought the same level of expertise to Twilight Trust. I study each employee meticulously—what makes them tick, what disturbs them, and how I can influence their actions and emotions. Why else do you think I tolerate people like Mr Fawkes?”

“You tolerate him?” I responded, in disbelief.

“Of course. Someone like him is a useful idiot to have on your side. He might believe his actions are genuinely helping people, which isn’t entirely untrue. A few individuals do wake up and turn things around. However, the majority only sink deeper into the chaos because they’re not prepared to confront the truth all at once.”

Mr. Finch’s tone shifted suddenly, becoming grave and reflective.

 “You know, Gavin, everything was running smoothly in my life as a Casino boss. Until one day when a crazy woman shot me dead simply because I broke her boyfriend’s legs for counting cards in my shop.”

“What followed wasn’t pretty. I wandered as a spirit for years—lost, angry, and bitter—until I encountered someone not far from here.”

“Care to take a guess?” he asked, pausing to let the suspense build before continuing.

“It’s our very own Mortimer, of course,” Mr. Finch answered himself, not bothering to wait for my reply.

“Mortimer was the unwitting casualty of a secret experiment gone wrong in the early ’30s. The government had seized alien equipment buried deep underground in the canyons, capable of transferring life energies between different mediums. But back then, we didn’t have the technology to harness it properly.”

“So when I heard about the existence of such technology, it ignited a fire in me that couldn’t be extinguished. I devoted every effort to uncovering more about it.”

“You know, Gavin, one of the perks of being in spirit form is the freedom it grants. I could go anywhere—even into the most secure government facilities—without anyone realizing. I could haunt and disturb those connected to this technology for days or weeks, until they inevitably led me right to it.”

“Eventually, I even managed to convince the Paranormal Sciences Division to green-light the project again. We assembled some of the best minds from around the world, each a genius in their field. It took us three decades to see results, but it was worth every moment, don’t you think?”

“So you’re saying Twilight Trust has direct government support?” I asked, flabbergasted.

“Of course. Who else do you think appointed me as its CEO? It was their way of rewarding me for my role in bringing this project to fruition.”

“But what is the point of all this, Mr. Finch? What exactly do you hope to achieve?” I asked again, struggling to see the bigger picture.

“Patience, Gavin, I’m getting there. When I entered the spirit world, I encountered countless beings like myself—souls stuck here on Earth, unable to move on. Each of them was bound by some unfulfilled desire, a deep yearning that anchored them to this realm.

It could be a trader betrayed by his partner, a wife murdered by her husband, or a father who couldn’t rest because he was worried about the family he left behind, who were struggling financially after his death. The reasons varied, but the result was the same—they hovered, restless, until their needs were somehow met.”

"This is where we come in. We offer them what they need—whether it’s financial aid or a temporary body to accomplish their unfinished business. But there's a catch: before we fulfil their desires, they must first do our bidding. In time, they become assets for the government itself. It doesn’t matter who’s in power—these spirits are in high demand. Whether it’s taking out a troublesome leader or carrying out covert operations on foreign soil, these souls are invaluable."

"Think about it, Gavin. What’s more effective than an agent who can vanish like a fart in the wind once the job is done?”

"And why do you think these entities are flocking to our bank to open accounts? They have unfinished business, and they’re more than willing to lend a hand to the government if it means finally achieving their own goals.”

 “Now do you understand why we need people like you working for us?” Mr Finch asked, his voice tinged with excitement.

I could feel my head spinning, the weight of everything he’d revealed pressing down on me. The timer was also winding down with only 3 minutes left on the clock. It did not go unnoticed by Mr Finch either.

“I guess we are coming to the end of our conversation, and you have a decision to make, Gavin. Do you agree to an extension in your notice period in our company?”

“ I need a verbal commitment from you right now,’ he said.

"What if I say no?" I asked, in an act of sudden defiance hoping to sound braver than I felt.

There was a chilling silence on the other end before Mr. Finch spoke again. “Why don’t you turn on the iPad again, Gavin?” he said, his tone now dead serious.

I fumbled my way through it and powered it on. The previous icon that contained the photographs and videos had disappeared, replaced instead by another new icon which seemed to look like it was a live stream. I clicked it even as I felt a pit form in my stomach.

The screen flickered to life, showing Mr. Finch sitting on a couch in my sister Kylie’s room. She slept soundly, unaware of the intruder next to her. He held a kitchen knife in one hand, the same one Kylie had hid under her pillow in a previous video.

Finch was casually testing its sharpness with the finger of his other hand. My heart raced as I scrambled to call Kylie’s phone, but I watched helplessly as it buzzed uselessly beside her on the live feed.

All this while he was speaking to me sitting in my own house!

Panic overtook me. I bolted from my seat and tried to open the office door, but it wouldn’t budge. I was trapped, blinded by fear. On the screen, Mr. Finch remained calm, and ordered me to return to my seat. Reluctantly, I obeyed, glancing at the timer—less than a minute left.

 “Don’t worry, Gavin,” Finch said, his voice eerily calm. “Your sister is fast asleep, and I won’t hurt her. Not today, at least. But I want you to understand the options at my disposal. I could easily hire one of our bank’s new customers to do the job for me. Or, if I’m feeling generous, I could have you sent to prison and then hire your siblings once they reach adulthood. Do you see where this is going?”

I nodded frantically as a paralyzing fear gripped me.

“So, do I have your consent for an extension on your notice period?”

“Yes. Yes. Yes,” I stammered.

 “Excellent,” Mr. Finch replied, satisfaction evident in his voice. “I always knew you were reasonable.”

Finch then moved directly in front of the camera until only his face was visible and continued speaking.

“And remember, Gavin, always follow the rules. Don’t let people like me or Mortimer ever get in your way.”

The call abruptly ended as the timer hit zero.

I slumped back in my chair, overwhelmed, when Line 7 buzzed in my office for the first time, and Mortimer’s voice broke the silence. “Mr. Lockwood?”

“Yes,” I responded, wiping sweat from my brow.

“I gather your conversation with Mr. Finch went well. Congratulations. According to the new terms, you’re required to work another four months at Twilight Trust. Is that acceptable?”

“Isn’t it supposed to be only two?” I asked, incredulous.

“Breaking the rules during Task Hour is a serious infraction,” Mortimer replied. “Plus, you’re no longer a newbie. Four months is required. If you agree, I’ll bring the paperwork right away.”

“Yes,” I replied back.

“And there is one other thing. Do you consent to share the contents of your file with future employees of Twilight Trust. Your consent is vital here Mr Lockwood. We have protocols to adhere to here.”

I agreed once more and ended the call.

As I sank back into my chair, a hundred thoughts raced through my mind. I worried about my future, my family, and when I’d ever escape this nightmare.

Yet, despite everything, I didn’t feel the urge to glance at the mirror in my office this time. Instead, my eyes drifted to the little portrait on the wall to my right.

The insect perched on the twig was no longer there—it had now become fossilized, encased in a glowing ball of amber.
