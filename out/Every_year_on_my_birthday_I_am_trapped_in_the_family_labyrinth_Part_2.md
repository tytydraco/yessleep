I had another nightmare last night. After everything I had just seen it was not surprising. Less than a day left now. I wish there was some way to escape. I don't want to go back, but I know that there’s nothing I can do to stop it. I try and calm my mind as best I can and prepare myself for what's to come, but the memory of seeing the mutilated form of Jaime emerging from the mausoleum shattered my resolve.

I left for my room after it was over. No one else in the family, at least the family members that I know, are in the labyrinth right now. No need to watch the door. So, I sit in my room and wait and brood. I wonder exactly how many hours, how many minutes, how many seconds until this place fades away, and the labyrinth emerges.

I could sit and wait like I did last year. I thought that maybe if I didn't sleep, then I might not wake up in the labyrinth. But whether I sleep or not, the same thing always happens. One way or another, at some point during the night, my eyelids will grow heavy. Then one slow blink later and the world will change, and the darkness will be there to greet me for the first terrible happy birthday.

I think about that year I tried to stay awake. It was a big mistake, I was exhausted as soon as my escape attempt started. I don't know how I made it out, but I was lucky. I can't make the same mistake again. Yet even after everything I can't turn my mind off and fall asleep.

I only managed a bit of sleep last night. Since it's the last day before I have to go, I know I have to calm my mind but the anxiety boils. I take a small measure of comfort knowing that my family will wish me good luck and share their prayers for my safety.

I hope it will not be the last time I see them. When they visit with me, I see the fear in their eyes as well. They know the danger, they know they can't spare me from it.

My mother was barely able to let me out of her arms after she heard what happened to Jaime. She understood that we could not do anything, that the person being tested by the labyrinth held their own fate in their hands, but that helplessness was tormenting her.

Her fear was understandable; it made me think about my older sister Lydia. She had survived eight years, was almost free, but she never returned when she went to the labyrinth on her twenty fourth birthday.

Despite the loss of cousins in the past. Our immediate family had been lucky in the labyrinth until Lydia. Lydia’s loss hit us all hard, but I think it made my mother realize just how dangerous and insane this curse truly was.

I knew she was thinking about Lydia whenever Jake or I had to go back into the labyrinth. She had to be praying that she would not lose another child in there. I did my best to comfort her, to show her I was ready and not afraid to face what was in store. I did not like lying to her, but I couldn't stand to see her so distraught.

I promised I would say goodbye before midnight, just in case I never returned. It was difficult, but I had to be ready.

My brother Jake checked on me shortly after my mom. We had a good relationship and he tried to make me feel a bit better by telling me a cheesy joke, but he frowned when I did not laugh. I apologized but he waved it off saying,

“No worries bro, just don't get lost in there. I will see you later, stay safe.”  Jake left and after an hour or so my dad checked up on me. I asked how Jaime was, but he held up a hand and shook his head.

“He is in bad shape, but he is at least somewhere where he can receive the care he needs. I think he will make it, but he was very badly hurt. I don’t know, but it seems to be getting....worse in there.” He told me while a frown creased his face. I knew he was trying to spare me the worst details. He knew it was my turn to go to the labyrinth next and his desire to be direct and warn me, conflicted with his attempts and reassuring me that I would be alright.

The truth is, at that moment, I did not think either of us knew if I would be alright. I was about to speak, when he cut me off,

“Look son, I don’t know how to ask you this, but...” He paused and I could see he was not sure how to phrase what he was trying to say.

“If it is getting worse. If there is something worse in there. Then we have to find a way to stop it. Not just escape, but to stop the whole thing. I know I've told you before you need to prioritize escaping and keeping yourself safe. I’m afraid I have to ask you to do something. I need you to try and find the hidden chamber.”

I couldn't believe what he was saying, I thought it was just a rumor, but it sounded like he was really asking me to try and find the hidden chamber that was supposed to have some sort of device hidden away that would stop the labyrinth from pulling anyone else in.

“I thought that didn't really exist. You told us not to look, you said it was just a rumor. How do we know its real unless...Did you see it?” I asked him and I could tell by the way he looked away briefly that he knew more than he had ever told us before.

“I’m sorry.” He put a hand over his face in shame and continued,

“I did see something. It was my final year, there was a symbol, an odd blue symbol that sort of looked like an Ouroboros. It lead to a hall that was impossibly dark. I thought it might be the way out, but I heard someone...speak to me. It was like the voice was in my mind. It beckoned me, but I fled. I turned back and looked for escape, because part of me knew that something was in there. But I always suspected, that whatever it was, whatever it was guarding, was the hidden chamber.” He sounded manic and desperate, but strangely hopeful. I could tell he really believed it could be the key.

We talked more about the hidden chamber and despite his apologies and reservations about telling me, I did not need convincing to agree to look for the chamber. I knew it was dangerous, but at least if I could find it and put a strop to this once and for all, then the rest of my family would be safe. I hugged my dad and said goodbye, hopefully not for the last time.

Now I am alone again and despite my fear at what comes next, I feel a strange energy, I know that I am not just fighting for survival, but also for the first time...hope.

It is getting late, I need to get some sleep. The labyrinth is calling and I can't keep it waiting.

I close my eyes and drift off to sleep, knowing where I will wake up. It does not take long. I am up, after what felt like mere moments. My bed is gone and I am laying on a dark stone floor. A thick trail or running water brushing against my head. I jolt upright and take in my surroundings.

I'm back again and I know I have to hurry. As I look around, my eyes slowly adjust to the dim light. Last year I was slumped against a wall at a dead end. This time, rather unhelpfully, I am in the center of a concourse with four long halls stretching out in each direction. I already feel at a disadvantage, but my decision on which way to go is made when I hear something in the distance. I cannot believe I am hearing anything, but even crazier, it sounds like a voice, a person calling for help!

I have never seen or heard anyone here before. I did not know any of my other family members would be here right now. I cautiously move down the path where the distant voice is coming from, and hope I am not making a huge mistake.
