I’ve been wanting to share this story with someone for a long time now. I’ve been sitting with this information for 5 months and I feel like i’m going to lose it any day now. I know that doesn’t seem like a long time at all, but when you hear what’s been going on, you’ll understand why each day feels like a lifetime. In the fear of dragging this out, I’ll just come right out and say it. 

For almost half a year I’ve been finding severed body parts in my house and I have no idea where they are coming from. Please believe me, I know how crazy I sound. Sometimes it’s little things like thumbs or toes but other times it’s entire arms or legs. One time it was a whole torso. The ends were wide open and I could see parts of the insides. I’m not sure if i’ll ever be able to get that out of my head. I’ve had absolutely no one to tell until this. I'm at a loss. I've developed insomnia, I have sickening anxiety attacks, stomach aches, and I barely leave the house.. 

I can't go to the police because I'm pretty sure “hey I found all of these body parts do you guys want them?” would get me a sure one-way ticket behind bars for the rest of my life. Listen, I'm a normal guy. Or I was before this. The days seem to blend together now. I worked a regular 9-5 and went out for the occasional drink with coworkers. I’ve since lost my job and am scraping by on my savings. I live in a small two-bedroom house on the outskirts of a big city. My family visits quite often- or they used to. My house used to be the gathering place for holidays. It gave everyone a good break from all of the city ruckus. If only they knew what was happening. I’m not sure they’d believe me. 

Listen ok everything was perfect. And it’s not anymore. My life wasn’t anything special but it’s.. It’s turned into a living nightmare. One that I can’t seem to escape not even in the few hours of sleep I do get. I have nightmares of getting arrested or hung or killed for all of this. One dream had me painted as some kind of monster in a big time documentary about how i’d killed them all myself. I’d woken up in a cold sweat and raced to check every streaming service id had. Obviously I was losing it but i was so paranoid. I still am. 

The first time it happened I was just waking up from a shitty night's sleep. It was 4 in the morning when I finally called it quits and rolled out of bed. It wasn’t anything out of the ordinary for me. I never slept all the way through the night but it used to feel at least restful. 
I got out of bed and headed to the kitchen to start the coffee pot. Like always I reached above to the cabinet that housed my mug collection. That morning I chose my favorite Garfield mug that said something about hating monday’s. I remember because when I opened the fridge for the creamer, Garfield cup full of black coffee in hand, that’s when I saw it. Sitting snuggly between the oat milk and last week's takeout was what I thought was a pile of spoiled old food. Like fish sticks or small sausages. Old food that I didn’t recall leaving there. Upon closer inspection, taking a few seconds for my eyes to adjust, my heart sank to my stomach and my precious Garfield mug slipped from my grasp. My hand flew to my mouth as I turned and barfed into the sink. 

How else was I supposed to react? Lying there under the white lights of my refrigerator were three severed fingers. Once I could stop losing the contents of my stomach I stood back up from my hunched position over the sink. With glossy eyes from the tears that formed, I looked back into the refrigerator stunned. After several long minutes of utter shock and confusion, for some reason I grabbed a pair of tongs and chucked each finger into the garbage. as well as the tongs. Because let’s face it I was never getting that image out of my head. No more stick shaped foods for me. 
After panicking and throwing them in the trash I sat down on the kitchen floor, sick and weak from what just happened. Although I didn’t know why my first reaction was to throw them into the trash right away, I knew pretty quickly I couldn't call the police. I had just discarded crime scene evidence. I mean it was a crime scene right? Maybe nothing had been committed right there in my kitchen but someone had to have broken in and left them there for me to find... 
I wasn’t sure there was a way I could explain that away to the cops. Now that you see the issue that I'm facing let me tell you just how many body parts have turned up. I’ve kept a log in a secret notebook under my couch in the living room. Not that I'd even dare let anyone come visit, I still hide it because after these past months, I know anything is possible.  

Like the fact that over the course of the last 5 months, 52 body parts have shown up in different parts of my home. The fridge, the couch, my desk chair, the actual fucking toilet, my BED, in the microwave, the shower, hell sometimes it’ll just be in the middle of the floor somewhere. Every morning when I wake up it’s like finding a fucked up version of the elf on the shelf. I've tried staying up during the night to catch someone sneaking in a secret way I hadn't thought of, but to no avail. I would continuously walk through my home all night waiting. But out of nowhere the body part would just pop into existence as soon as I left the room, ready for me when I did my next round. I never know where the next body part might be. You're probably asking how I dispose of these body parts. But the other issue is I don't. 

I’m not a criminal. I haven’t done anything wrong. I would just hate it if anyone got the code to my storage unit. Then I'd have a LOT of explaining to do… and I wouldn't even know how. I feel crazier by the day. I’m not sure how much longer I can take this. I’m not a bad guy. But something or someone is out to get me.
