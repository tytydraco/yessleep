My small town on the coast of Massachusetts is home to plenty of mysteries and rumors that run back to a time before my great great grandparents were around.  
  


I don’t believe many of them.  
  


But there is one. One that I know is real.

The dock is just an old finger of wood and salt bleached stone, stretching into Deepwater Bay. By day, it’s harmless. Lobstermen smoke and gut their catch there. Children dangle their legs off the edge, tossing pebbles into the blue. Gulls scream overhead like they have since before the town was ever charted.

But at night, there is a glow. Pale. Greenish. Like an old gaslight lamp burning underwater.

It comes from the end of the dock.

No one remembers a lamp being there. Not even the Harbormaster, whose father built that dock with his own hands. Well, because it was never really there… when everyone was around at least.

But some nights, especially foggy ones, there are whispers that it appears. Just barely visible. Only if you’re already looking. Only if you’re out there on your own.  
  


And that is the problem.

Once you see it, you want to get closer. Or so I heard.

The rumors say it looks like a lantern someone left behind. Just sitting there. Lonely. Flickering. It sways gently in the breeze, like it is hanging by a hook or chain. It never makes a sound.

Most folk don’t believe the stories, but most folk don’t go skulking about at night. Most folk have no need to. That’s the thing. Everyone who saw it, went looking.

Sometimes, people go missing. A lonely heart. A night fisherman. A teenager who wants to prove to his friends that it’s real. Always alone. Always just one person.

Hardly anything ever washes up. No bodies. Maybe a shoe. Sometimes a thermos. A bloody scrap caught in the rocks.  
  


The police blame the tides.

But some of the old ones in town, the ones who remember things they shouldn’t, say something lurks in the bay. Something older than the dock. Older than the town.

Something that hunts.

Something that’s ancient.

I didn’t believe it. Not until last year. Not until I followed the light.

Couldn’t sleep. The fog was thick. The streetlights looked like dying stars. I wandered. Ended up near the water.

And there it was. The glow. Flickering soft and slow at the end of the dock.

I walked out. My mind, close to blank. The glow was charming. There wasn’t a real reason for me to go out that night, it just happened. The memory of climbing out of bed and walking along the harbor blended and blurred until I felt as if it was just a dream.

The planks creaked beneath me. The ocean was quiet. Waves rolling up softly — calmly. The groaning of old docked row boats, tugging on posts through sailor knots, added to the symphony. It was nice to be alone.

When I reached the end, I crouched to get a better look at the lamp, thinking maybe it was real. Maybe someone left it. Maybe it was worth something.

Then I saw it.

The light wasn’t hanging. It was growing.., not growing, raising.

A stalk of slick, pale cartilage stretched out of the black water, swaying gently. The glowing orb pulsed at the end like a living lure. It was part of something beneath the surface.

I saw it just as it lunged.

A face, if you could call it that, surged from the water. Wide, glassy eyes. A mouth filled with jagged, human-like teeth. Its skin was gray, stretched, slimy. Webbed hands broke the surface.And rising behind it, a twisted, extended spine, holding the lure above its head like a lantern on a fishing line.

I ran. I didn’t look back.

Not until I was halfway down the dock did I hear the splash behind me. The thing slinking back beneath the surface.

Now, when the fog rolls in, I stay far from the water.

And so should you.

Unless you want to dance with Dagon.
