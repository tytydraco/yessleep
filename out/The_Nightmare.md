The nightmare 
There’s 5 rules to the nightmare.
1.) You can’t fall asleep after midnight. If you’re not asleep by midnight you must stay awake til the sun comes up.
2.) You must cast a protection spell on your room every night before you sleep.
3.) You must always keep a line of salt across the back door of your house.
4.) You must sage your house every new moon.
5.) If you realize you’re in the nightmare you must run as fast as you can to the hollow tree and climb inside. I hope you’ve been practicing your lucid dreaming skills.

Welcome to the nightmare club. Once you’ve been welcomed you can never leave. So glad you came…..

First order of business have you been practicing your lucid dreaming skills like the dream teacher told you last week? The beast is getting stronger and will reach its peak for this cycle on 12/22/2022 so I sure hope you’ve been doing your homework. Or did you zone out in class again? 
Let me refresh you. Every night before you sleep you need to say out loud 3 times “I will remember my dreams.” Upon waking you must write down what happened. This was the first thing taught in the dreamers course for conquering the nightmare so I hope you remember. We learned a few months ago that every 4th dream you have will give you 1 small key component to defeating the beast when the time comes so I hope you’ve been paying attention to your dreams. We’re counting on you for your 8 keys. We will need all 88 keys to put the beast to rest. It will be semi problematic if it were to kill you in the nightmare before we got those keys. I trust you’ve been closely following the rules though since your reading this now. Either way I’m sure you could be replaced with a new member in no time. After all the welcome can’t be opt out of.

This week we covered the keys for the 5th raven-warrior, that’s you in case you weren’t paying attention. You’ll need to gather a small pocket watch, an intact bloomed dandelion head, a black widow, 44 connected links of a rusty chain, a red handled dagger, the nutty wizards left shoe, and 12 rose thorns. You’ll be keeping the dagger for battle. The rest will be for the potion creation in class on 12/2. I highly recommend attending class that day if you wish to survive. 
I’ll list the other raven-warriors keys in good time for the others who haven’t taken good notes. 
Oh also before I go we had to update the protection spell for rule number 2 as it appears the nightmare broke through last night and killed one of our ravens.
The updated protection spell is as follows. Recite out loud; Salt of earth guard this home while I’m here or when I roam. In my dreams I may be far but to my body will come no harm. Then turn 3 circles clockwise. 

Sweet dreams.
