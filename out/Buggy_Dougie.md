***The Beginning***

I came home early to surprise Sheila, roses in hand.

The front door wasn’t locked.

I heard them before I saw them.

The bed creaking like old floorboards at the Bates Motel. Low voices. Whispered laughter.

Then her voice.

Then his.

I stepped into the doorway.

They saw me.

My wife and my best friend, Jack.

That's when the world I knew caught hellfire and I became its first ember.

I turned my back on my home for the last time.

...

***Exodus***

The studio was shitty.

A mattress on the floor. No furniture, just half-packed boxes and silence.

Roaches found the apartment before I did.

At first, just one.

Crawling across the kitchen counter, slow and deliberate, like it knew something.

Then more.

Behind the fridge. Under the sink. In the folds of my blankets.

I killed them. Wiped them off my plate. Pretended they weren’t always watching.

The acid reflux started after that.

A slow, creeping fire, crawling up my throat.

First at night. Then at work.

Then all the time.

I kept bottles of Rolaids and Tums in my desk, my pockets, my car. Popped them like candy.

*Didn’t help.*

My daughter stayed with my ex.

She needed insurance. Dialysis wasn't cheap. She needed my insurance. Private, expensive, the kind I could only keep if I kept my shitty job.

*I had to keep my job.*

But the industry was dying.

***The Keeper of the Gate***

No one wanted IT consultants anymore. No one was hiring anymore. Layoffs hit every month like a Mike Tyson punch.

HR kept posting bullshit openings they never meant to fill—“future opportunities,” they called them. Future lies.

*I was drowning.*

Miguel made sure my life preserver was made out of lead and spite. Miguel didn’t just burn employees he tortured them first like a cat with a mouse. He tortured candidates too.

Every consultant interview was a grueling autopsy, stretched over weeks, layered with impossible questions that had zilch to do with the job.

"What’s the time complexity of sorting infinite data?"

"How would you optimize a database that exists only in theoretical mathematics?"

"How do you debug a system with no logs, no errors, and no access?"

And then—

"What language came before C?"

The guy hesitated. Shifted in his chair.

"Uh… B?" he intuited.

Miguel flashed his patent-pending smirk at full voltage. Smacked the table with his greasy little hands.

***"Check out the big brain on Brad!"***

The guy forced a smile.

Miguel leaned in. "And what does that help you do?"

*Silence.*

Miguel sneered, sat back, scribbled something onto his notepad.

He never hired Brad. Hell, he never hired anyone. Just made them dance, made them sweat, made them question everything—then let their rejection email arrive months later, boilerplate and cold.

He would tell Marcellus, "Can't hire them if they can't do the job!"

I was one of the unlucky few to get past the gate. I had that kind of face that bullies loved to hate. Miguel liked watching people suffer.

***Enter Doug***

*Doug was one of the only hires who made it onto the team since the market went tits up*

No one really understood how he slipped through.

Where others cracked under Miguel’s inquisition, Doug answered cleanly, quickly, precisely.

He barely moved during his interview. No shifting in his chair, no hesitation, no unnecessary gestures. His fingers hovered over the keyboard, still and ready, like they were waiting for some unseen signal before springing into motion.

He was given seven brutal coding challenges he completed fast as if he were writing his sweetie a love letter.

His scores were perfect. Marcellus told Miguel, "Hire him."

Miguel *hated* him. But Doug never blinked.

"Jesus, Doug, you ever *not* stare like that?" he’d snap during meetings.

Doug wouldn’t answer.

Miguel pushed harder.

"Swear to God, you look like you don’t sleep. You're bugging me out, dude!"

Doug tilted his head just slightly, like he was examining a new alien life-form.

Miguel sneered.

"Bet you don’t. Bet you just sit there all night. Watching."

Doug remained still as the night.

Miguel thrived on tormenting him. Yet Doug never fought back, never spoke much. Just worked. Worked and watched.

And Miguel. He just pretended to work and fumed. All five feet four inches of him. Short. Pockmarked. Always sweating.

Three breakfasts deep by 9 a.m., Miguel was chronically slurping coffee between mouthfuls of something fried.

He typed with two fingers, his lips moving, stabbing the keyboard like he wanted to break it, muttering under his breath, shaking his head. Muttering out loud, *"What the fuck did this guy do?!!?!?!?! He can't code! He can't do the job!"*

Every failure—someone else’s fault. Every problem—someone else’s burden. He never stopped banging on those keys like a red-headed step-child except to get up to pee every fifteen minutes; fifteen shots of espresso rattling through his bloodstream, keeping him mean, keeping him loud, keeping him in control.

Once Tim, our DBA asked him if all that coffee didn't make him jittery.

*"Doesn't affect me at all! I been drinking it since I am 5 years old. It's a thing."*

Tim nodded as if to say, *"FuhhhhhhK!"*

And Miguel's hair—so stiff with spray you could play a game of quarters on it. A frozen shield, untouched by sweat or time, like it had been built for war. Head down steamrolling over every poor soul he crossed paths with who couldn't do something for him.

He was the quintessence of kiss up, punch down. And I was down. Way down like the job market.

Miguel saw me for what I was—a lifelong consultant hanging by a thread, clawing to stay employed and keep my daughter's kidneys from failing.

And Miguel used my plight for profit and sport. Every joke at my expense. Every public teardown.

***Trouble in Paradise***

Then one day the system crashed hard. Right after an update Miguel was responsible for. A total failure.

*The dreaded:*

**500 Internal Server Error** 

*... flashing on every screen of every user.*

Clients screaming. Money bleeding. Roosters pecking. Marcellus called it a catastrophe and told me to work with Miguel on isolating the issue.

I suggested a rollback. Miguel shot me down and said my latest module introduced a memory leak. I knew it was bullshit but held my tongue. No time to gamble with my daughter's well-being.

***Triage Time aka The All Nighter***

Miguel barked orders, snapping at engineers, slamming his fist against desks, refusing to admit the crisis was his fault.

I stayed in the office all night along with Miguel. Everyone else had gone home to get some sleep after midnight.

*I was getting blamed. Getting framed.*

I felt abused and hopeless and exhausted from no sleep.

Popping Rolaids and ignoring my ex-wife’s slew of texts demanding more money. Money to take our daughter to more specialists not covered by my shitty but expensive as fuck insurance. I guzzled more shitty office coffee, risking my own kidneys in some twisted form of solidarity, I supposed.

Miguel waddled in circles behind my chair, wearing out the shitty gray office carpet.

He was sucking down yet another espresso, jittery as fuck, muttering to himself incessantly—then he suddenly stopped behind my chair.

*I hated people looking over my shoulder.*

Miguel leaned in close until I could smell the sour coffee and cheeseburgers on his breath.

Lowering his voice he said, "You know, man...," before letting out a dramatic sigh and slowly shaking his head to and fro, "times like these… job security isn’t guaranteed. I don't think Marcellus wants to renew your contract. You can lose your job."

I felt the burn of acid climb my throat like an adamant gorilla.

Miguel, voice calm and casual like he was discussing a weekend outing to the zoo continued.

"We need people who can handle *pressure*, people who don’t choke when it really matters."

I swallowed hard and felt the sweat form on my upper lip. I resisted the urge to wipe it away.

Miguel smiled like a viper. Clapped a hand on my shoulder.

"Hope you’re one of them. Especially for your daughter's sake." Then the rooster waddled away for his fourth lunch or dinner or whatever kept his lard-ass neck and neck with his ego.

***Dread Dawn.***

I had caught myself nodding off. I wiped some drool off my face and woke my screen up.

Don't ask me how but....

**The system was fixed. Up. Running. As if nothing had ever happened.**

CIO Marcellus came in smiling, dragging half the executive team behind him, glad-handing anyone in arm's length; talking big as his doofy bouffant.

"Let’s go get Miguel! I knew he'd fix it!" he grinned, leading his cohort of enablers toward Miguel's office. I followed sucking on a *Tums* and dreaming of dreaming.

***"Miguel! Big save, buddy, come on, let’s celebrate!"***

Miguel ignored him.

He sat stiffly at his desk, hands flat, head still as the night, as if the lights were on but nothing and no one was home.

Marcellus chuckled, stepped forward, gave him a congratulatory pat on the back—

**Miguel’s head dislodged. It bounced off his keyboard, landed on Marcellus' left wingtip then rolled toward Angela. She screamed!**

Then some screamed, "Good Lord!"

Then the flood. It poured out of Miguel's still rolling neck, mouth, eyes and ears. Roaches, maggots, ants, worms, and even a praying mantis.

Thousands of bugs swarmed Marcellus, running up his hand and arm where he had just slapped Miguel on the back. Then crawling into his shellacked hair from every conceivable direction, twisting through the strands, climbing back down his arms, across his tie, his chest, all over that fucking suit he must have had seven identical copies of.

Marcellus screamed. Loud.

He frantically tried to get the bugs off him. He swatted at the ones on his chest. Everyone in the room ran for cover. I stood frozen unable to move from just outside Miguel's office door. Within seconds Marcellus was covered in a bug suit.

Then Marcellus' bug covered face grimaced. His hand clutching his chest. He looked around and our eyes met. I saw a look that screamed, "This can't be happening. I am the goddamned CIO!"

Then his eyes rolled back in his bug covered head and his tongue protruded. And, without further fanfare Marcellus dropped dead. He fell to the shitty gray office carpet next to Miguel's head which rolled next to his own, coming to rest at an odd angle.

***The Aftermath***

The police were, of course, involved.

Security footage was reviewed.

Doug had been in Miguel’s office. And the server room. Right at the moment everything had been fixed.

The police detectives started digging.

Two days later, an officer pulled a director aside, face pale.

"Doug’s been dead a couple of years. Lost his job at Twitter and jumped off his roof. We got a warrant and exhumed the body, and well that was Doug in that coffin; DNA confirmed it."

Nobody ever mentioned Doug again after that.

***Reorg***

I was the only one left who knew how the system worked.

They made me CIO.

A couple of days later, I was at my desk in my old cubicle, cleaning it out and preparing to move into Marcellus’ old office once the painters were done.

Inside the top drawer of my desk I spied an unfamiliar envelope with my name handwritten on it under a 12 pack of Tums.

I didn't recognize the handwriting. I tore the envelope open curious as George.

Inside was a handwritten note that read:

...

*Hey Joe,*

*Sorry about your daughter & all the rest.*

*I died from kidney failure just about two years ago and when I saw what you were going through, well, well I just couldn’t leave you hanging.*

*I know you don’t remember me, but back in college the frat guys on your hall were hazing drunk-as-a-skunk me.*

*I'll never forget them trying to get me to eat that Ritz cracker rubbed on a urinal and worse.*

*That's when you came in to take a piss and saw the whole scene.  I remember you telling me, "they ain't your friends."*

*I remember you calling them all douch*e *bags. Then I remember one of them Grand Poobahs got in your face, posturing for all his brothers.*

*That was Halloween 1988.*

*You were dressed like Humphrey Bogart in a trench coat and fedora.*

*You headbutted the biggest guy, you remember Alex, don't you? What a bully! Then you grabbed him by his frat hoodie with one hand and started slapping him across his face with the front and back of your other hand.*

*I'll never forget what you said while you slapped him, "When you're slapped; you'll take it and like it."*

*You were a senior and I was just a freshman, but you were the only guy who ever stood up for me like that in my life.*

*After that night I forgot all about Greek life, but I never forgot that night and I never forgot you being a stand-up guy.*

*So, I just wanted to say a belated thanks in my own way.*

*Sincerely,*

*"Buggy" Dougie.*

*PS*

*Don't let the bed bugs bite ;D*

*...*

And just like that, the burning in my throat stopped.

Or maybe—I just couldn’t feel it anymore.
