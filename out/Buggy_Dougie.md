I came home early.

The front door wasn’t locked.

I heard them before I saw them.

The bed creaked. Low voices. Whispered laughter.

Then her voice.

Then his.

I stepped into the doorway.

They saw me.

The world split open.



I never went back.

The studio was shitty.

A mattress on the floor. No furniture, just half-packed boxes and silence.

Roaches found the apartment before I did.

At first, just one.

Crawling across the kitchen counter, slow and deliberate, like it knew something.

Then more.

Behind the fridge. Under the sink. In the folds of my blankets.

I killed them. Wiped them off my plate. Pretended they weren’t always watching.

The acid reflux started after that.

A slow, creeping fire, crawling up my throat.

First at night. Then at work.

Then all the time.

I kept bottles of Rolaids in my desk, my pockets, my car. Popped them like candy.

Didn’t help.



My daughter stayed with her.

She needed her insurance. My insurance. Private, expensive, the kind I could only keep if I kept my job.

I had to keep my job.

But the industry was dying.

No one wanted consultants anymore.

No one was hiring at all.

Layoffs hit every month.

HR kept posting bullshit openings they never meant to fill—“future opportunities,” they called them. Future lies.

I was drowning.

Miguel made sure of that.



Miguel didn’t just burn employees.

He tortured candidates.

Every consultant interview was a grueling autopsy, stretched over weeks, layered with impossible questions that had nothing to do with the job.

"What’s the time complexity of sorting infinite data?"

"How would you optimize a database that exists only in theoretical mathematics?"

"How do you debug a system with no logs, no errors, and no access?"

And then—

"What language came before C?"

The guy hesitated. Shifted in his chair.

"Uh… B?"

Miguel grinned. Smacked the table.

"Check out the big brain on Brad!"

The guy forced a smile.

Miguel leaned in. "And what does that help you do?"

Silence.

Miguel sneered, sat back, scribbled something onto his notepad.

He never hired him.

He never hired anyone.

Just made them dance, made them sweat, made them question everything—then let their rejection email arrive months later, boilerplate and cold.

I was one of the unlucky few to get past the gate.



Miguel liked watching people suffer.

Short. Pockmarked. Always sweating.

Three breakfasts deep by 9 a.m., slurping coffee between mouthfuls of something fried.

He typed with two fingers, stabbing the keyboard like he wanted to break it, muttering under his breath, shaking his head.

Every failure—someone else’s fault.

Every problem—someone else’s burden.

He peed every fifteen minutes—fifteen shots of espresso rattling through his bloodstream, keeping him mean, keeping him loud, keeping him in control.

And his hair—so stiff with spray you could play quarters on it.

A frozen shield, untouched by sweat or time, like it had been built for war.

Miguel saw me for what I was—a consultant hanging by a thread, clawing to stay employed.

And he used it.

Every joke at my expense.

Every public teardown.

But the worst was when he compared me to Rick.

Rick was a senior dev. Stable, permanent, valuable. Not like me.

"You know, Rick would’ve had this fixed hours ago," Miguel muttered, shaking his head, sighing dramatically. "Guess not everyone’s cut out for high-pressure work."

I kept my face blank. Didn’t react. Didn’t let myself look at Rick.

Miguel leaned in. "You just have to keep your head, huh?"

Laughter.

The others didn’t look at me.

Miguel smiled, satisfied.



Then Doug arrived.

Doug was quiet. Unshaken.

We noticed little things.

Never blinked enough.

Sat too still.

Cracked his neck just a little too far.

Hands always twitching, fingers curling absentmindedly, like they weren’t used to resting.

Sometimes he’d rub his arms—like something was crawling under his skin.

Sometimes his jaw would tighten—like he was suppressing something.

Miguel hated him immediately.

Doug fixed things Miguel had claimed were unfixable, made accreditation possible, made Miguel furious.

Then the software running the entire company collapsed.

A total failure.

Everything down.

Clients screaming. Money bleeding.

Miguel barked orders, snapping at engineers, slamming his fist against desks, refusing to admit the crisis was his fault.

I stayed all night.

Getting blamed. Getting abused. Popping Rolaids and ignoring my ex-wife’s texts demanding more money for our daughter’s treatments.

Doug was nowhere to be found.

Miguel paced behind my chair, sucking down another espresso, jittering, muttering—then stopped.

Leaned in.

Lowered his voice.

"You know, man," he sighed, shaking his head, "times like these… job security isn’t guaranteed."

I felt the burn of acid climb my throat.

His voice was calm, casual.

"We need people who can handle pressure," he continued, watching me sweat, "people who don’t choke when it really matters."

I swallowed hard.

Miguel smiled.

Clapped a hand on my shoulder.

"Hope you’re one of them."

Then he walked away.



Morning.

The system was fixed.

CIO Marcellus came in smiling, dragging half the executive team behind him, clapping hands, talking big.

"Let’s go get Miguel," he grinned, leading them toward his office, still giddy off the win.

"Miguel! Big save, buddy, come on, let’s celebrate!"

Miguel ignored him.

Sat stiffly at his desk, hands flat, head still, as if the lights were on but nothing was home.

Marcellus chuckled, stepped forward, gave him a pat on the back—

Miguel’s head dislodged.

It slid off his shoulders, wet and sickening, as if it had only been loosely attached all along.

Then his throat convulsed.

A shudder. A slow, wet tremor—

And the bugs erupted.

The burning in my throat reached its peak.

I almost choked.



Days later, I was at my desk, cleaning it out.

Promoted to CIO.

Moving to Marcellus’ office.

I found an envelope.

Opened it.

Inside was a note.

It read:

Sorry about your daughter.

I died from kidney failure two years ago and couldn’t leave you hanging.

You don’t remember, but in college the frat on your hall was hazing me drunk, forcing me to eat a cracker rubbed on a urinal. You saved me. Called them all dicks. Busted the frat boy bully in the nose.

You were a senior and I was a freshman, but you were the only guy who ever stood up for me.

Sincerely, Buggy Dougie.



And just like that, the burning stopped.

Or maybe—I just couldn’t feel it anymore.
