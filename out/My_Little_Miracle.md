"Little Miracle"—it's the nickname my parents have called me for as long as I can remember.

My mom and dad always wanted to have a child. When I grew older they told me about the many years of miscarriages and health issues they went through trying to bring a child into the world. When they found out about my conception they were ecstatic. They thanked God for his blessing and worked closely with doctors to ensure this was the one they got right, but it wasn’t easy.

During the entire pregnancy, my mother had issue after issue. Preeclampsia, hyperemesis gravidarum, pre-term labor, and more. Scans showed visible structural abnormalities in me as an embryo, even if I was born it was likely I wouldn’t have a high quality of life. Later tests showed signs of sickle cell anemia as well.

 My parents didn’t care, they believed that with enough prayer God would heal me in my mother’s womb and take away my limp arm and leg. It didn’t work.

At around the 26-week mark, the preeclampsia got so bad that doctors had to induce labor. It was bloody, painful, and horrifying for both of my parents, but by the end of it, I was born. Quickly the nurses and doctors hooked me up to machines and kept me growing in the NICU. During the time I stabilized my mother recovered as well. After about a month I was allowed to be brought home.

Pain medication became my daily routine. Without it, agony would seize my body for hours—or worse, the seizures would come. On top of that, my left arm and leg were just stubs wearing the facade of being useful. After getting a prosthetic leg I was able to walk, but an arm was too expensive for my parents to afford. Even with a new leg, I wasn’t able to keep up with the other children. Watching them run and play together filled me with deep envy. I tried to play alongside them, tried to fit in. But who wanted to be friends with the “limp?” 

That was also my nickname. My peers would laugh in glee as they tore me apart, there even was a time when a group of them stole and hid my prosthetic leg. My teacher had to convince them to give it back, but even then they had written all kinds of words and phrases on the metal. 

But I was still a little miracle, the joy of my parent’s lives. They told me not to listen to the other kids, that I was a blessing that I couldn’t understand. My pain would bring me wisdom and strength that others would wish for. 

What about what I wished for? I wished that I had functioning limbs. I wished that I didn’t need to be drugged just to be ok. I wished that I hadn’t been born as this misbegotten miracle. 

They never once told me I had a negative impact on their lives but I heard what they thought behind closed doors. Some nights I would hear my mother sobbing behind her closed door and my father’s gentle voice consoling her. I always wondered why she was the one crying, she wasn’t the one in pain. It got to a point where I forced their door open and confronted them. 

I called them selfish, how could they be the ones feeling guilty when they had every chance not to go through with my creation? How could they have the gall to proclaim that I was somehow a miracle? My words made my mother cry harder than ever, and my father’s face filled with anger. For the first time in my life, he put his hands on me, he slapped me hard across the face leaving my cheek throbbing and me stunned. Afterward, he stood there in disbelief at his own action and tried to quickly apologize.  

I hobbled out of the room not giving either of them a chance to speak. I didn’t want to hear an apology unless it was about bringing me into this world, yet it never came. They acted as if that night never happened, and before going to school my mother kissed me on my head and called me her “My little miracle” as if trying to convince herself.

At that point something unexplainable happened to me, I felt as if the partial humanity I was born with had suddenly been drained from my body. I wasn’t anything close to a miracle, and if they didn’t want to understand my suffering I wanted them to experience it themselves. A few nights later, I had slipped enough of my lorazepam into their drinks to keep them passed out through the night. I took this time to bind them to the bed using the rope we had in the garage, and I grabbed a large stake knife from the kitchen. 

When I stood over them I stopped for a moment. I looked over their greying hair and resting faces. I almost turned around and went to bed but in my head, I heard the same phrase repeat itself on a loop. 

“My little miracle.”

I thrust the knife over and over into their sleeping bodies with a hollow apathy. I felt little resistance as I went, and I was only spurred on when my father slowly opened his eyes in response to my mother’s gurgles. He tried to raise his hand but was caught by the rope. When our eyes met all he could mutter was a half-hearted “I’m so sorry.” 

 By the time I had finished my hands and face were stained red. The only part that bothered me about the whole situation was that I felt grossly sticky. So I went and took a long hot shower, washing away the grime of the scene I had left in the master bedroom. When I finished I dried myself off and went downstairs and called the police on myself. I stood at the front door, holding the knife in my hand, and waited for them to arrive. 

When they did they drew their guns on me and told me to drop the knife. Instead, I sprinted as fast as I could toward them, but from their perspective they must have seen a girl lazily limping toward them. I wanted them to shoot me, and for the first time in my life, I prayed to God. I prayed that he would give me a quick release. Instead, I ended up shaking uncontrollably on the ground with taser barbs stuck in my chest. Eventually, the shaking evolved into a full-body spasm, and an uncontrollable seizure overtook me. 

While my vision blurred and darkened I wondered to myself, am I still a little miracle?
