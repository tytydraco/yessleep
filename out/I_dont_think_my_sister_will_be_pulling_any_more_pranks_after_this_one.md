“Could you run any slower?”

One of my sister’s favorite hobbies was taunting me on our almost-daily runs we’d started a couple week ago. She called it motivating; I called it bullying. When my rheumatologist had instructed I stay active to slow down the progression of my arthritis, this wasn’t what I had it mind. Anyway, wasn’t running supposed to be hard on your joints?

Despite my huffing and various joint pains, we somehow managed to make it back to the driveway with a couple seconds improvement on our last time.

Early the next morning, we geared up as usual.

“Couldn’t we have a break for just one day? I can feel a fatigue episode coming on,” I begged.

My sister wasn’t having it. Neither of us liked my grandmother very much but she’d still managed to pick up the matriarch’s persistence.

“Come onnnnn,” she wined, “you can do it one more time this week before you give up.”

I willed my stiff fingers to pull my tennis shoes over my aching toes and ankles. I couldn’t let the disease win, or something like that, right? I still didn’t like how that small amount of effort had me breathing heavily despite it being a much easier task just a few days ago.

“Anyway. . . “ 

My sister had a glint in her eye that didn’t mean anything good. 

“. . . I have an idea that’ll help you forget your fatigue.”

I didn’t dare to hope it would be anything enjoyable like a glass of Sangria from the Mexican restaurant we passed on our runs.

I could usually tell how the run was going to go based on how hard the hill was at the beginning. It wasn’t giving me any motivating indicators. My legs were still sore from yesterday, and I could already feel a pounding in my chest. 

Before I could launch another complaint, I heard footsteps behind me. My sister must have heard them too because she glanced back for a second.

Her yelp and quickened pace had me suddenly racing.

I had the thought that this had been her idea to get me moving more. She wasn’t past scaring me to get a rise out of me.

I took a second to glance behind me.

The figure dressed in full black keeping pace behind had me not caring if this was a prank or not. A hood blocked their face just enough to keep me from identifying them without completely hiding the terrifying glint in their eye.

If this was my sister’s prank, it was effective in making me forget my fatigue. While my treatment had been largely helpful in easing my pain and fatigue, adrenaline was the one consistent thing I had found to temporarily reduce my symptoms, as much as I paid for it later. 

The corner past my girlfriend’s house went by in a blur. I barely even registered the Mexican restaurant. You’d think someone would have been concerned, but it’s crazy how people always end up wrapped up in their own lives the most the moment you need help.

I pushed down chest pain as we sped down the hill to our house. I knew it had to be part of a prank. Why would we have gone our normal route instead of stopping at any of the places we passed if it was anything otherwise?

My sister’s laugh between gulps of air as she slowed confirmed my suspicions.

“One minute! One minute less than yesterday!”

The scolding I had for her stuck on my tongue when I felt a firm grip on each of my arms. I watched terror creep on my sister’s face.

“You’re not Jon!” she exclaimed.

Her plan must have backfired. Instead of her coworker she got. . . 

I turned to face him as his hood slipped from his face.

. . . my ex.

My ex if you could call him that. We’d had a short fling a couple years ago before I realized I was lesbian. His sporadic apologies through various social media platforms for his awful behavior while we were together never acknowledged that reality.

My sister dialing 911 and both our screaming didn’t deter him from shoving me in the backseat of a tan sedan. I caught a glimpse of Jon in the driver’s seat and the distain on my sister’s face as she recognized him.

I don’t think my sister will be playing anymore pranks on me after this.
