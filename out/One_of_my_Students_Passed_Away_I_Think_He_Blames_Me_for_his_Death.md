TW: Self Harm

&#x200B;

“Not your best work.”

Justin’s face sank, sullen defeat scrawled across his features.

“Professor Stone, I worked on this for hours.” I pursed my lips, shaking my head.

“Justin, your story was riddled with typos. Not only that, but you had very little character development, and your plot was… lacking. All I’m saying is, I know that you can do better.”

A pang of guilt struck me like a lightning bolt as I walked away. I wasn’t trying to crush the kid’s spirit. I just wanted to motivate him to work harder. Light a fire under him, ya know? If only I hadn’t said that…

Justin was absent from the next class session. I began to wonder if I’d pushed him too hard, but I crammed the notion to the back of my mind and focused on the students that did show up.

“That’s all for today, class. Read chapter 7 tonight and come ready to discuss on Thursday. Don’t even think about skipping the assignment either. I’ll know if you didn’t read.”

Several students scoffed as they filtered out of the classroom. I watched them go, single file like ants marching to a bread crumb. Once they’d mostly cleared out, I noticed a woman in a pink cardigan fighting against the current. She angrily shoved students out of the way, beelining straight for my classroom. She stomped straight up to me, her emerald green eyes burning with rage.

“Hello ma’am, how can I-”

*Smack.*

My jaw dropped. I stared at her in shock as I placed a hand over my throbbing cheek.

“What the hell, lady! I don’t even know who you are. What was that for?”

“*What* was that for? You mean who, you selfish fucking asshole. I’m Gloria Valdez. Justin’s mother. He killed himself yesterday. All because of *you*.”

Her words rang in my head like a gong as my brain struggled to process them. Justin had taken his own life… because of me? My mind raced back to our last interaction. This couldn’t be happening. I just wanted him to put in a little more effort. Never in a million years did I think it would come to this.

“I- I don’t understand,” was all I could manage to squeak out.

“Maybe *this* will help to clear things up a bit,” Mrs. Valdez spat, shoving a piece of loose leaf paper into my chest. Tears were brimming in the corners of her eyes. I numbly took the paper from her and began to read.

*Dear Mom and Dad,*

*I’ve been thinking about this a lot, but now that I’m actually writing it out, I don’t really know what to say. I want you two to know that this is not your fault. There’s nothing you could have done to prevent it. I’ve felt empty for a long time, and nothing could cure that. Well, nothing except for writing.*

*Writing has been my passion ever since I was thirteen years old. It’s always been my dream to become a published author. But that will never happen. After taking Professor Stone’s class, I’ve come to realize that my writing is crap. Even after years of practice, putting hours upon hours of work into every assignment, crafting each story with the utmost care, I still haven’t amounted to shit. And I never will.*

*That being said, I don’t want to be remembered as the awful writer I was. I burned all the pages in my writing journal and deleted my stories from my laptop. You’ll never have to read the garbage that I pumped out. I’m sorry for doing this to you. I really am. You two have been the best parents that I could have asked for. But the pain is too much to bear. I just can’t go on like this any longer.*

*I love you, Mom and Dad. Thank you for everything.*

*Until we meet again,*

*Justin*

Tears blurred my vision as I glanced up. I can’t begin to describe the amount of guilt I felt at that moment. It really was my fault. Maybe if I’d shown a little more compassion. Maybe then he’d still be here. Maybe…

I shook my head, staring holes into the floor. “It can’t be.”

“Well, it is. He just wanted to be an author and you destroyed his aspirations. My son is d-dead, and you’re responsible.” Mrs. Valdez threw her hands over her face and broke down, ugly, lamented wails reverberating off the walls. Unsure of what to do, I placed a hand on her shoulder for reassurance. She immediately swatted it away.

“Don’t you fucking touch me, you-you-you *murderer*. I hope you rot in Hell for what you did to my baby boy.” She snatched the note from my hand and shot me one last parting glare before dramatically slamming my classroom door shut on her way out.

I couldn’t contain my emotions any longer. I bawled my eyes out for a solid hour straight. How could this happen? I’d had no clue that Justin had been struggling with depression. I would have approached it so much differently if I’d had any inkling of an idea. After all, he really wasn’t a bad writer. He just needed a nudge in the right direction. But as it turns out, I’d unknowingly pushed him over the edge.

I made the fifteen-minute drive home in complete silence. Mrs. Valdez’s words replayed over and over in my mind like a broken record.

*He killed himself yesterday. All because of* ***you***.

Even as my head hit the pillow, her voice joggled around in my head. All. Because. Of you. Eventually, the stress and exhaustion won out, and I drifted into a fitful slumber.

I awoke in my classroom, facing the chalkboard. I wearily rubbed my eyes and yawned. Wait. My classroom? How was that possible?

I quickly patted myself down and breathed a sigh of relief. I was fully clothed. Maybe I’d blacked out from the mental strain? I began to feel around for my phone, when suddenly, I froze.

The atmosphere in the room had shifted. Something dark and oppressive floated in the air. I felt eyes on the back of my neck. My heart pounded like a jackhammer as dread surged through me like a tsunami. I didn’t even need to turn around. I already knew who they belonged to.

I decided to rip off the bandaid. I spun around, blood pounding in my ears. And there he was.

Justin sat in the back of the classroom where he always did. A gray hoodie obscured his face, but even through the shadow cast over his visage, I could see two bright, burning eyes.

I gulped, swallowing my pride. I didn’t know how or why we were here, but I needed to make things right. I took a tentative step closer.

“J-Justin look, I-” The words caught in my throat. The hood slipped from Justin’s head, allowing me a full view of his face.

Gray, ashen skin stretched tightly over bone. Congealed blood dotted his face, marring his mottled cheeks like battle scars. His lips had withered away, yellow, rotting teeth peeking from his mouth. And those eyes. His pupils glowed red, bathing his desk in an eerie, luminescent glow. Jet-black tears flowed down Justin’s cheeks, staining his skin like ink against paper.

“I’m so sorry, Justin. You know- AH. What the…”

My head exploded with pain. Every synapse in my brain screamed at me, pleading to put an end to the hurt. I squeezed my eyes shut and clasped my temples. I shrieked in agony, crumpling to my knees. It was getting to be unbearable. But, just when I thought that I wouldn’t last another second, it stopped.

I hesitantly wrenched open my eyes. Justin was gone.

I began to turn my head, but I stopped in my tracks. Hot, musty breath assaulted my neck. A putrid stench stung my nostrils. Justin’s demented voice bellowed into my ear. I’ll never be able to rid those words from my mind.

“You can do better.”

I awoke in a cold sweat, hyperventilating. It was all a dream. But it felt so real…

I laid awake for the remainder of the night. How could anyone sleep after something like that? The image of those angry, radiating eyes was burned into my mind.

After hours of lying there without a wink of sleep, I laboriously slid out of bed. I went through the motions, drowning my worries in coffee. I knew it was a temporary fix, but it did the trick for the time being. I did my best to clear my conscience of Justin. But that proved more difficult than I ever would have imagined.

I’d been zoning in and out for hours when I suddenly found myself back in my classroom. I was teaching. Dozens of eyes stared at me expectantly. I gazed out into the sea of students diligently jotting notes. I paused when my eyes landed on a gray hoodie at the back of the class.

I began trembling and all the color drained from my face. I thought my heart would stop at any given moment. He was back.

“No, no, no. This can’t be happening. I-I’m seeing things. Yeah, that’s it,” I muttered, avoiding eye contact with the figure.

“Umm, Professor Stone? Are you okay?” A petite blonde girl in the front row asked. Concern swam across her countenance.

“Y-yeah, I’m fine. Just feeling a bit feverish. Class dismissed.”

As the students were filing out, the one in the gray hoodie glanced up. A girl with long black hair yawned, grabbed her backpack, and trudged to the exit.

“Thanks for letting us out early, Professor. I hope you feel better soon.”

“Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mary.”

I needed to clear my head. I was losing it.

I drove to the local park. It would be a welcome distraction from all the chaos that had ensued over the past few days. I trundled into a parking space and took a deep breath.

*You can do this, Tim. Just relax.*

I hadn’t even stepped out of the vehicle when I froze in place. My skin began to crawl as that prior feeling of dread came crashing down on me like a ton of bricks.

I locked eyes with a man standing in the treeline. There was still a good distance separating us, but I didn’t need to squint to tell who it was. We stayed like that for a long time, entranced in a nauseating staring match. And then, he took a step forward.

I didn’t wait to find out what he wanted. I slammed the car into reverse and peeled out of the parking lot. I must have looked like a maniac, but I didn’t care. I just needed to put as much distance between myself and that *thing* as I possibly could.

I screeched to a halt in my driveway. I clutched my chest and focused on my breathing. It felt as if I was being crushed by a hydraulic press.

What I saw in the park… that wasn’t real, was it? No, it had to be some kind of hallucination. I *was* sleep-deprived, after all.

With that thought in the forefront of my mind, I shuffled anxiously into my home. The first thing I did after discarding my jacket was turn on all the lights in the house. Paranoid much? Sure, but it did put my mind at ease.

I collapsed on my bed, the overhead light beaming into my face. I couldn’t take the pressure anymore. Just a nap. That’s all I needed to get my head straight. I closed my eyes, and I was out in an instant.

I awoke in my dark room, cold and sweaty. My heart leapt into my throat and I felt nauseous. I could feel eyes burning into the back of my neck. The same hateful, loathing eyes from my dream. This couldn’t be happening. It had to be another nightmare, right?

Against my better judgment, I rolled over and straightened myself against the headboard. I quickly discovered the source of my discomfort.

Standing in my doorway, with that same sinister expression, stood Justin. He grinned at me maliciously, showcasing rows of jagged teeth. His red, burning pupils illuminated his visage, highlighting the deep black streams cascading down his colorless cheeks. Justin licked the remnants of his lips, slowly inching closer to my bed.

I had to snap out of it. I slapped myself hard. Nothing. I glanced at my alarm clock. It displayed legible numbers. Both surefire tests to determine if I was dreaming, failed.

I began to panic. This was real.

“Justin, please hear me out. I didn’t know what you were going through. I just-”

He pointed a mangled finger at my desk where my laptop sat. He didn’t need to say it. I knew what he wanted.

I apprehensively sidled over to it and sat down. I booted up my laptop as Justin’s foul, rotten breath tickled the nape of my neck. I opened up a Word document and began to type.

That’s where I am now. Writing this. I don’t know what he’s planning on doing with me when I’m done, but I’m ready to accept my fate. Because Justin has caught every mistake. Every misplaced comma. Every misspelled word. Each time, it’s accompanied by a debilitating headache as those four incessant words relentlessly pinball in my brain. I know why he made me do this. Justin only wants to inspire me, like I did him. And he’s constantly reminding me:

*I can do* [better.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)
