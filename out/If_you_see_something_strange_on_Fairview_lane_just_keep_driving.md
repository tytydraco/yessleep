“Do you mind if I play some music?”

“I kinda just wanna listen to the radio Harry”

“Uhh, you don’t *ever* let me play the music anymore.”

“I just like to listen to the radio, that’s all. It’s nice to hear different music sometimes.”

“I get that, but can we at least change the channel?”

“Can you just fucking chill out? Jesus. Besides, I like this song.” She turned it up.

“Sorry, I just don’t really *dig* all this old stuff you know? — Wow, what the fuck is that. What the fuck? Jesse, what—“

“—Oh my god. Oh god—“

“—is that! Stop the car! Jesse! Stop the car!”

She slammed down the breaks, making them scream out. The truck bounced around and she jerked the wheel to the right, turning us sharply. We damn near rolled over in the road, and came to a stop so close to a hedgerow it was almost funny.

I said, “Jesse, quick turn on the—“ but before I could even finish my sentence, she was already pulling her finger off the button. Hazard lights engaged.

For a few seconds, the slick croons of Elvis Presley were the only sounds filling the forested silence.

Then, Jesse was shouting. Something like, “Harry, Harry. Oh my god, Harry. Did you see that? Did you see it?” And, of course I had seen it. I’d been the one to point it out in first place, the strange shape on the road.

You could drive out on those lanes and not run into another person or house for hours. The roads are lit only by the moon and the headlights of the passing cars, and it was now dark. Inky. The alchemical kind of black that merges objects and transforms them into unfamiliar, unsettling, assemblages.

She said, “what was that?” and “God. I thought we were gonna crash right into it.” Then she paused for a moment, and asked “did we?”

“Maybe.”

“I don’t remember if we did or not, it all happened so fast.”

“It happened very fast, babe.”

“We should go out and take a look, shouldn’t we?”

“Maybe,” I said again, then asked if she had a flashlight, and she said “no,” then added “actually yes, obviously,” flourishing her phone.

Her hand was hovering, ready to open the car door, when she asked, “do you think maybe we should get the crowbar from the trunk first? I mean, it’s so dark out there. It’s kind of scary.”

Jesse’s always been kind of a junkie for danger. Sure, she’d act like she was scared, but I knew her better than that. We’d been together long enough. She was the type of person who daydreamed about the end of the world, some kind of horrible apocalypse, just so she could go and smash a bunch of shit, and hit zombies with makeshift weapons, people too probably.

Regardless, she was right. It was dark, and it was scary. And, what the fuck was that thing in the middle of the road? I could see it, sort of. Lying there. On the ground. Softly glowing orange every time the hazard lights blinked out, like a lighthouse on a shore.

“Should I get it,” I asked, and just incase it wasn’t obvious, added “the crowbar?”

But, she said “oh I can get it, I don’t mind. Just keep an eye on that fucking thing. See if it moves.”

She opened the door and hopped out, then crept over to the boot. I could hear her, rummaging around back there. I kept my eyes fixed to side though, looking at the shape. What was it? It looked a bit like road kill now, but before. Before it was…

Tap, tap, tap. The sound startled me, but it was just Jesse, knocking on the car door with the crowbar. She signalled for me to come out. My shoes hit the ground with a softly, lock-up keys quietly jangling on their chain.

I whispered. “Jesus Christ, you nearly gave me a heart attack, babe.”

“You should’ve seen your face, it was priceless.” She mouthed, and laughed silently. Then she held up a finger to her mouth to say, “Quiet!”

She turned on her phone torch, pointing it at the ground, and led the way.

We edged closer to the strange shape on the road, until Jesse got close enough to give it a good look.

“Oh, we are so dumb.” She said, laughing out loud now. “Harry, I think it’s just a deer.” She nudged it with the crow bar, and sure enough, it was a deer, albeit bloodied, and broken up. “Pretty dead though.” She added.

“A deer? Yeah, we are ridiculous.” I said, feigning confidence “You know, I could’ve sworn it was something else, it looked kind of *different* when we were driving. I got so worked up just now.” And I pushed out an uneasy laugh.

“No, you’re right. In the car it looked. It was like a. It was—” she took a quick step back, an uncertainty entering her voice “What?”

“What? What’s wrong?” I asked from behind her.

“It’s face, Jesus Christ. Look at its face. Harry!” She was back to whispering again, more urgently now. “Oh Harry. What the fuck. Look at its face!”

She hooked the carcass with the end of the crow bar, pulling it around to look at me.

Where there should have been the head of an adolescent deer, there was a pulpy, bruised face. Slick with blood, and glistening in the light of Jesses phone torch.

A human face.

“Oh god.”

“It must be.”

“Oh, what the fuck.”

“It must be some kind of… Some kinda… Harry?”

“Yeah, uh, some kind…”

“Some.”

“Jesse, I don’t know what the fuck that is.”

She snatched the crowbar away, and the deers head and neck slumped back on to the tarmac with wet sound like ‘fthlump’. Its head and human face bouncing twice before coming to a rest on the gravelled surface.

If it wasn’t so beat up and bloodied, and if it wasn’t grafted onto the skull of a deer, it might have been, almost elegant. It had a sort of peaceful expression, the kind of expression you’d find on a painting of a saint, in a church.

“Jesse, get the light off that thing. I can’t look at it. It feels wrong to look at it.”

“Yeah, sure. Of course babe.” She said, switching off the light and putting her phone in her pocket. Then she slid her spare hand into mine and led me back to the hood of her truck.

Then it was just a dark shape again, periodically blinking orange. We sat there for a while, unsure of what to do, and talked in circles.

“What do we do?”

“What was that thing?”

“Did *we* kill it?”

“What are we gonna do.”

Until, eventually, we saw another pair of lights. An approaching van, some way away. As it got closer, it noticed our hazard lights and slowed down to a halt a little way behind us.

\--

“I’ve gotta be honest, I’m a little relieved. For a good minute there, I thought you were gonna tell me you hit a person or something.” Said the man from the van, after we explained the situation to him. “You both okay? You look like your in shock.”

He was balding, maybe in his sixties, and he was dressed in a close fitting boiler suit. Over his heart there was a small embroidered logo, the same one that was on his van.

COOPER AND FAMILY LTD

Your Plumbing Solution!

Behind his ear, he’d tucked a rolled cigarette, which he’d retrieved when I told him about the face. He’d seemed to wrestle with the idea of lighting it, smoking it, but eventually he tucked it back behind is ear. I figured he was trying to quit.

“We’re just a little shaken up,” I said, my hand tight, grasping Jesse’s, her other hand clenched around the crowbar. “It’s face. You gotta understand, it’s—“ I trailed off , unable to explain myself again.

“Don’t take this the wrong way, kids, but shock, it’s a real powerful thing. Probably, your mind was just playing tricks on you.”

What he said sounded sensible, it was rational even. But I knew what I saw. In my heart of hearts, I knew it for a fact. There was no way that it had been a figment of my imagination, plus Jesse had seen it too, and how do you explain that?

Then he said. “Listen, if it makes you feel any better, I could go and take a look for you, clear all this up?”

I couldn’t help feeling a sense of unease. Jesse obviously felt it too as she took her hand out of mine, slipped off the hood of the truck and offered him the crowbar. “Take this, just incase, okay?”

“Honestly, I don’t need it I’ll be fine.“

“Take it, please. It’ll make me feel better.”

He did, and then walked over.

As he got closer to the deer, torch in one hand and crowbar in the other, he slowed, until eventually, he froze altogether. “Good lord.” He said.

Jesse cupped her hands around her mouth and shouted “See! Just like we told you.”

He didn’t seem to hear her, he just continued exclaiming to himself. “Why I’ve never seen anything like it, long as I’ve lived.” And “What in the hell is this thing.”

Jesse shouted again. “Now do you believe us!?”

I couldn’t shake that feeling of unease. “Hey, you’ve seen it now, so come on! Come back here! Let’s talk about it!”

He heard me. “Just one second kid. I just…”

The man who we had not known long enough for him to have even thought to introduce himself, leant down, bending over the deer.

There was no warning sign.

Three, slender and sinuous tendrils stripped themselves away from the deers neck, leaving long, maroon gashes in its hide. They coiled themselves around his neck before he even had a chance to notice them.

Firmly in their bind, he let out one, piteous yelp. Then they killed him.

They must have been very sharp, because the slits across his throat were made so deep, and with such ease, that his death was almost instantaneous.

He made a desperate attempt to take in a final breath, which only bubbled through the lacerations. Then he fell over the deer. A deep purple now spreading through his blue boiler suit like tie dye.

“Fuck.” I said, expelling the words, more breath than voice. “What the fuck is happening.” Now I really was in shock. I didn’t even have a scream in me.

Jesse took my hand again, this time dragging me back inside the truck. “Fucking hell, I gave that guy the god damn crowbar.” I just nodded long, not really hearing her. “I don’t think I’ve got anything else in the back.” I kept nodding, the rhythm of it felt good, sort of comforting. “Harry. Are you listening to me?” Nod. “Harry, god damn it. We have to do something, okay? Harry?”

“Uh-huh”

“God, you are no good in high stress situations,” she said, rolling her eyes, “Just put your seatbelt on, okay baby?”

She threw the truck in reverse and started driving away, all the way back up the road, past the dead mans van and even further.

Good, I thought. Yes. This is good, we’re getting away. Good.

Then she switched gears, and began to drive forwards.

No, that doesn’t make sense, I thought. Not back there. Not there.

“Jesse. What are you doing?”

“We can’t just ignore it, Harry.”

“We can. We can call the police. We just have to get somewhere—“

“—Yeah and if we call the police, they’re not gonna believe a word we say. Then they’re gonna go check out the man and the deer, and the exact same thing’ll happen again. Rinse and repeat. Is that what you want to happen babe?”

Slowly, I shook my head,

She slammed down on the gas. Forwards.

She hit twenty. She hit forty. Sixty. Eighty. She hit a hundred, and we collided with the man and the deer like a fucking train.

A blushing film of scarlet mist and viscera coated the windscreen setting off the automatic wipers, and, this time we *did* enter a hedgerow. But she pulled the car right back out again, and began adjusting her rearview mirror to get a better look.

I stared, blankly, at her, and wanted to say a thing, anything, but I could find no words, nothing to express myself with.

She looked at me sympathetically and patted me on the thigh with her hand. “Just hold on, babe,” and then, like she was talking about something so ordinary. “It’s still moving.”

She stuck it in reverse, and this time she took it real slow. Deliberate. Driving backwards over the man and the deer. Twisting the wheel, grinding the tires, as she went.

\--

“You okay babe?” She asked, as she finally pulled up the handbrake, a little way away from the site of impact.

“Mmm,” I said, still struggling for words.

“I think we got it.”

“Mhmm,” I mumbled, nodding my head.

“Listen Harry, babe. I need you to start being useful again. Okay? You need to give me a hand. Is that alright?”

“Yeah, uhh. Sure. Just give me a second” I said, and tried hard to shake myself loose from all the shock.

She left her headlights on this time, and we got out of the truck. The beams spotlighted, what had just been, the body of a man and the creature. Now, there was not much of anything left, just a mostly flattened boiler-suit and a few, rogue pieces of deer.

“Oh, what! Jesse, look at that!” I said, pointing at the cracked head of the deer-creature. “What is that? What’s that, inside of it?”

“Wow. That’s not… It’s not blood or like, brains. What the fuck is that?”

“I don’t know. It sort of looks like…”

“Like vines?”

“I was thinking spiders legs.”

“Ugh, gross. I hate spiders.”

“So what now?” I asked.

“Well, first we’re gonna pick up what’s left and put it in the back of my truck. Then you’re gonna find the keys to his van and drive it into the reservoir.”

“No, Jess. That doesn’t make any sense,” then, whispering angrily, “the man has a family. The van doesn’t say Cooper, the lonely old man who no one’s gonna notice is missing. Its Cooper and *Family*. Family, Jesse. Family. Surely *now* we can call the police? Surely?”

“Okay, and tell them what exactly, Harry?” She said, pointing to the chunks, and the smears across the road. The word overkill probably hadn’t ever been more appropriate.

“I feel like you’re actually kind of enjoying this. You are, aren’t you?

She said, “don’t be ridiculous,” but I could see that she was smiling a little bit as she turned to get a blue tarpaulin from the back of her truck.

We laid it out flat on the road, and she began kicking the remnants into the centre of the plastic sheet.

She asked me if I’d found the keys, and I said “no,” and then she sighed and rolled her eyes again, muttering something about having to do it all herself. And she began to search the pockets of the recently vacated boiler-suit.

“Gotcha.” She shouted, proudly, and threw them in a perfect arc, into my palm. Then, dusting off her hands, she said, “I think that’s everything. Help me wrap this up and bring it to the back.”

“Jesse I…”

“Harry, are we just gonna leave it here now, after all of that? For some random person to find?”

“No I just… It’s just disgusting thats all, I—“

“Exactly, now you take this end, and, on the count of four we lift.”

“Fine, fine.”

“One, two, ah-one, two, three, *four!*”

We raised it up, carried it over to the truck and swung the tarpaulin, letting it fall into the open boot. As it landed, the fracture skull of the deer bounced out, tendrils splaying out. It’s broken, human face, looking up, frozen in a death mask, somehow still looking remarkably peaceful. A stray lock of auburn hair curled down over its remaining blue eye.

“Go on then. You’ve got the keys to his van. You know what to do babe.”

I fumbled with the keys a little, my hands still shaking, as I clambered into Mr. Coopers van. I sat for a minute, eventually managing to get the keys into the ignition, and I left them there for a while as I googled routes to the reservoir on my phone. I selected a path with little to no traffic. Better not to be seen, I figured.

The van had those old school manual windows and I rolled down the one next to me, and asked Jesse, “What do I do? Once it’s done I mean. Will you pick me up?”

“Yeah, but not by the reservoir, just in case. Meet me at the intersection, off of Bidford lane. You know, the one by that old barn we always point out?”

“Okay, baby.” And then I said “I love you.”

“I love you too, babe.”

I rolled up the window, and turned the key.

The radio jumped to life, playing some oldie, and I switched it to a different station.
