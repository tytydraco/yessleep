The counter above is how I track what day I'm on. Every day, when I wake up, I type that before I forget.

There are a million movies surrounding this. They all focus on comedy. This is not funny, this is a living nightmare.

It has been December 13th, 2022, for about 4 years. I have written this Reddit post too many times. I don't post it every day, but I almost always do, in the small hopes that someone's advice will work.

My wife is 9 months pregnant. Every day, at 11:49pm, she goes into labour. No matter what I do differently, it always happens. On the drive to the hospital, at exactly midnight, everything always goes black, and the day resets to when I was sleeping this morning.

I don't even always wake up. Some days, at midnight, I'm suddenly back to dreaming again. Sometimes the dream even continues the drive to the hospital. I always wake up before my wife gives birth - And I always cry.

A terrifying thought I sometimes have is what happens to my wife. Is everyone in the world resetting, but I'm the only person with the memories? Am I in a different universe, and the version of me driving the car thinks they've broken the loop? Do I disappear for her, and there's a car crash? That last one is the most terrifying for me. Some days I don't even drive her down, and she's furious at me for it. I hate to do it, but I like to think I'm saving her from a potential crash.

Sorry if it feels like I'm not writing much about myself. When I was only a few days into this, my posts were short. A few sentences at most. I would add more information every day, cramming more and more information in. Eventually, it got to the point where most of my day was spent typing things up, and it got tiring. Whilst this is your first time reading this, I have written slight variations of this post over 1,000 times. I'm too burnt out to make this one a long one.

Asking for advice in person takes too long, and usually, nobody believes me. The internet is the best way to reach a large number of people, fast.

The comments are always slightly different - Probably because nothing is truly repeatable. The simple act of me wording this *slightly* differently each day will cause different outcomes for that day.

A few things are usually the same, though.

u/BriteBytes, you're going to comment about how this reminds you of Groundhog Day, and how it's been your nightmare since you were a kid. You're also not going to read this far down because you never notice this prediction.

u/Skipper15cp, you're going to comment about trucks.

I'm kidding. You're actually going to write some cocky comment about how I was wrong, and fate doesn't dictate you. Also, *you're

Please, anyone, I need something to break this cycle. I am sick of this day. I don't want death to be the only way out.

I want to see my daughter.
