Our sun has been acting up lately. Storms, flares, coronal mass ejections. I was told it was natural. Nothing to worry about. We were just in a solar cycle and storms on the sun would get worse for a few more years until the cycle peeked, and gradually solar activity will return to normal.

But it’s not so benign. At first, I thought the folks at NASA were keeping things hush hush because of a potential Carrington Event; a solar storm so powerful that it sends enough radiation to earth to melt the energy grid and send us back into the dark ages.

As horrifying as that sounds, such an event would be a comfort compared to the truth.

Right now, I’m around 94 million miles from earth. Some of you will realize about where that places me. We expected things to be bad, but not like this.

Just a few hours ago, things were still normal.

Our spaceship is so damn cramped. No, that’s an understatement. Its *coffin* cramped. We sleep in bunks so tightly stacked that my nose touches the fabric of the cot above me.

Coffin Cramped. Huh. I’d called it that since launch, but the irony is just beginning to dawn on me.

There were four of us in the crew. Me, Margo, Ted and Jin.

At 1400 hours today I felt like I was a little boy again, bickering with my sister on an airplane over the sunshade. But this was of course a *little* different.

“Please, Margo,” I begged. “We’re restricted from opening any ports after 50 million miles. It’s my job to enforce shit like that. I’m not trying to be the bad guy.” I was trying to act like I didn’t want her to open the port covering our spacecrafts only window because I was a bureaucrat. In reality, I was terrified of getting toasted by cosmic radiation.

She gave me a pitying look. It was an expression that the rest of the crew had been giving me more and more as the mission went on. They knew more than me.

I didn’t get the same security clearance briefing as they did. I knew we were looking to retrieve an experimental probe that went dead in orbit around the sun. And that the plan was to retrieve the data it failed to relay, and boomerang home using the sun. All and all the mission would take most of a year.

But I didn’t get to know all the details. I’m not even an astronaut. I’m a hired gun. I spent a dozen years in the Army special forces, retiring as a Captain. My selection for this mission should’ve been the first red flag.

But I was too busy thinking how awesome it would be to get to space. Besides, I made a living by not asking questions. I was told I would be the security specialist for the space flight. I thought maybe all long missions needed someone like me.

It made sense when you thought about it. You put four people in a tube for almost a year and fights are due to break out. Believe it or not astronauts are not all timid geniuses. There are some gravitational egos floating around Earth’s orbit in the ISS.

My job was to keep everybody in check. Follow the rules, be civil or Murphy will handcuff you for a timeout. But 30 days before launch I was given a list. Things to look out for. Signs and symptoms. And I realized I was not just here to keep the peace.

Of the more concerning bullet points were things such as:

“If any crew member experiences bleeding that could be hemorrhagic (blood seeping from ears, eyes, nose) or starts speaking in a strange way (mutterings, a throaty tone that sounds like another language) immediately quarantine them in their ECP.

ECP stood for Emergency Containment Pod. In our tight little ship, six of these steel coffins were lined up in the wall, opposite our bunks. Every place you could fit a toothpick was important. So, it was god awfully concerning why so much space was allotted for those things.

But before I saw any of this shit, the lists, the containment pods, the look of doom in the eyes of the other astronauts, the ink was dry. The contract was signed and unless I wanted to fake an injury there was no way out. It seemed like NASA was expecting madness on this mission and my job was to keep it at bay.

And the red flags kept coming one after another, like a clown with nothing but crimson scarfs up its sleeve.

If you’re a big space nerd, you may have heard of the Parker Solar Probe. In 2018, a spacecraft the size of a sedan was launched with the intention of uncovering the mysteries of the sun’s corona and solar wind. But it discovered something else.

The probe went dark 8 months ago. Me, the rest of the crew, and dozens of top scientists and brass were briefed with a PowerPoint composed of blurry images. Now, the pictures weren’t in 4k. The probe uses white-light imaging that gives photos a grainy look like you’re looking at the Loch Ness monster.

But with the help of a projector and nervous men with their pointer sticks, I was able to understand what I was looking at.

There was a black and white blur of stars in the background and coming out of them, streaked by the speed at which it travelled, was something that looked like a screaming, human face. And it was coming right for the probe. It was the last image it took.

Sounds kind of funny, doesn’t it?

But the room was quiet with fear. No one seemed to offer an explanation for why the object that disabled the probe gave us all a bad case of facial pareidolia. Its hollow eyes weren’t level, and its mouth was jagged. I thought it could be passed off as some kind solar radiation interference. After all, no space craft or camera had ever been so close to the sun.

But I didn’t raise my hand, I sat quietly confused as they started talking about the distances between the eyes and mouth. Distances? In the picture the thing looked close, like it might be twenty feet long. The room came alive with nervous murmurs as they concluded that the facial object that appeared in front of the probe was roughly the size of the Pacific Ocean.

Were traveling gas clouds a thing? Or of course, radiation interference? But I didn’t ask these questions. It felt like every obvious answer was out the window. Otherwise, the room wouldn’t have felt so eerie.

They told us the probe was not destroyed and it was lingering in orbit, and our crew had the herculean task of retrieving it.

I was given a folder of the general mission plan and then dismissed along with dozens of others with lower security clearance while the rest of the crew stayed sitting.

I thought maybe they were going into technical details that I wouldn’t understand. But as the days and meetings went on, and from the tight-lipped smiles I got in the halls, I knew I was told half the truth.

Looking at it now, it wouldn’t have made a difference. Up until hours ago I still knew nothing.

Margo ignored my pleas to not open the sunshade and set her hand on the window switch. “Visors, guys?”

The whole group was equipped with a gold visor, sunglasses on steroids as we called them. They allowed us to look out the window without being blinded by the sun. Hell, they were so effective we could stare at the sun if we so wished.

Ted and Jin nodded and donned their giant bug-eyed glasses. It was beginning to feel like we were on a suicide mission and I was the only one still ignorant to that fact. The cosmic radiation from the window, even for a few minutes, could cause serious complications down the line.

I didn’t say anything. I nodded gently, defeated. I flipped my goggles on and Margo hit the switch. An alarm sounded and the metal shade begin to slip into the wall. We were all silenced by what we saw.

No, my blood didn’t run cold. Nor did my hair didn’t stand on end. At least not from fear.

17 million miles away sat our sun. A silent ball of fire burning almost white against the blackness of space. From as close as we were, we could see the fire storms slowly swirling on its surface. Systems of flames the size of Earth.

Ah. I’m done. Words can’t do it justice. Mountains, stars. Even the aurora borealis swimming pink paled in comparison to this view of space.

The four of us had a moment gathered around the window. Four faces pressed against a porthole looking at beauty so incredible it was truly indescribable. It was a while before any of us spoke.

“Should probably close this up,” said Jin. “Radiation and all…”

“Yeah,” Ted snapped to attention like he’d been in a trace.

The alarm blared and the metal shade returned to cover the glass, but I kept staring at where the sun just was. Ted and Jin went back to the tiny table that folded out of the wall where their poker hands sat dealt but untouched and looked at one another.

It’d been 122 days since launch, and we were sick of talking to one another. An hour went by and I tried to read, but quickly found myself getting warm.

“Ted, can you turn up the cold air?”

“These cooling units aren’t meant to last much longer than the mission. We got save it for when it really gets hot.”

“Is this not really hot?” Ted ignored me and I looked at the rest of the crew, but they just shrugged.

“Whatever,” I muttered and starting to read again.

But twenty minutes later my stomach dropped. I was sweating so much I had to wipe my brow. There was a sheen of sweat on the back of my hand. I looked up with alarm and immediately locked eyes with Margo. She had her fingertip in front of her and she stared a bead of sweat resting on the tip.

It was getting hot far too fast.

Before I spoke the comm station crackled to life with an electronic voice. “Message incoming.”

We were so far from earth that radio transmissions weren’t instant. This billion-dollar spaceship used what was essentially a fax machine to communicate with earth. The screen lit up with big letters we could all see.

“BASE JUMPER, CONFIRM YOUR SPEED AND LOCATION”

Ted rose from his seat with a start. “I told you it was too hot,” I muttered.

“Shut up,” he went to the cockpit and checked some of the instruments before quickly speed walking back to the comm station. He typed furiously and spoke over his shoulder to us. “We’re off course and gaining speed.”

“What, you can’t be serious? How much speed?”

Ted leaned back from the screen biting his lip “200,000 Kilometers an hour.”

“Jesus,” said Jin.

“That’s the increase, not the total. We’re at 320,000 now.”

Margo climbed into the cockpit and Ted took the seat next to her. Jin went to the instruments wall just behind them and started giving readings. Everybody had a job here except for me.

“We’re being pulled in!” Ted shouted.

“Cabin temperature rising 2.3 Celsius a minute,” Jin said calmly.

“Don’t worry folks, this thing is meant to withstand the heat from reentry. A little sunshine ain’t no thing,” said Ted, but I could tell he was just trying to be the man in charge. There was terror in his wide darting eyes. “Engage starboard thrusters! Sun side! Sun side!”

Margo flipped a series of switches. “Thrusters engaged.”

“Give ‘em it all!”

Margo eased the throttle all the way up and the starboard wall begin to roar. Although there was no difference in gravity or feeling I clung like my life depended on it to the pole that supported our bunks.

“3.4 Celsius a minute. Sir, I need to blast the cooling or we’re gonna bake.”

“Do it!”

Jin furiously clicked a button sending the A/C temp as low as it would go. It blew freezing air into the cabin. With the sound of the thrusters and the cooling system everyone put their radio sets on. I grabbed my headset off my bunk and moved the mic in front of my mouth.

“It just doesn’t make sense… the thrusters changed our course by 0.1 degrees. We’ve already reverted.”

“Maybe there was a malfunction,” said Margo.

“Fuel levels suggest normal activation and all thruster sensors indicate they made it into position.”

“Jin,” said Ted. “How long can that cooling system keep us at a non-lethal temp?”

“Depends, if you want to be smart but uncomfortable, I can set it to keep the temp below 35 celsius. We’d be hot but we’d live.”

“Do it.”

“Roger.”

Everybody was silent for a moment and I hesitated to speak. Elements are a funny thing and I was out of mine. I’m confident under gunfire when there’s no evac, yet I felt like a child as these astronauts assessed the situation. “So… what’s the problem?”

“We’re still off course. I can’t… I don’t have control of the ship,” said Ted. Margo, Jin and him all looked at each other. There was some kind of understanding in their eyes. A knowingness that this may happen.

“Think we’re at the farm?” Margo asked Ted and he nodded ever so slightly.

“What’s the farm?” I asked. I didn’t care about sounding naive anymore. I was too afraid.

“We’re in a tractor beam,” Ted flipped some switches off. The sound of the A/C and the thrusters lessened, and he slipped off his headset and stood. “We’re being pulled by something.”

“You people have to talk to me, to where?”

“Into the sun.”

Margo and Jin looked defeated. Ted opened the drawer in the wall that acted as his footlocker and pulled out a brown bottle of rum.

“Want to switch off the comm station Jin? I swear we’re fucking bugged.”

“Oh…” Jin powered down the comm station and the lit-up buttons all went dark. “What’s it matter anyway?”

“Why are you all so calm?” I sprang into the middle of the craft. I was beginning to get angry. I had been the dumbest guy in the room for more than a hundred days and no one pretended otherwise. I was damn near a breaking point.

“Murphy,” Ted twisted the cork out of the rum bottle with an echoey pop. “This wasn’t a suicide mission. I want you to know that,” Jin held out a plastic cup and Ted splashed some rum in. “Something has been hiding behind the sun. Some… structure. We know it can move, since the sun does too and somehow it always manages to stay hidden.”

Ted sighed, grabbed a plastic cup, filled it and put it in my hand. But I didn’t drink it. He sighed. “That probe that was launched a few years ago, the one we were supposed to retrieve, it wasn’t sent to study solar activity. It was sent to figure out what the hell our radar was detecting and why ever since this structure appeared, the sun has been going crazy with solar flares. To be honest we still don’t know but we have a pretty good idea of what’s happening. We have a theory.”

“And what’s the theory?” The three of them looked at each other and I set my rum down.

“We think our sun is being mined.”

“Mined?”

“For energy. I know, why this sun when there are so many others without intelligent species in orbit? But we figure that they’re so advanced they don’t care. Our sun was probably closest. The next gas station so to speak. We’re only theorizing here but based on the strange and concerningly strong solar activity that’s built up in the last few years we can tell that something is effecting the energy of our star.”

“So, you don’t know if any of this is true? What about the symptoms list I received where’d that come from?”

“The International Space Station is empty. Evacuated. The astronauts there, they started bleeding and going mad just when the Parker space probe captured that image… Hardly anyone knows this, but we are the only human beings in space right now. And Murphy, I really think you should drink that rum.”

I picked up my cup and drank the rum in one swift gulp. I held the cup out for more. “Why me? I mean, there were so many others to pick for this shit.”

“You’d be shocked at what percent of the special forces fails the psyche eval for going to space.”

“Actually, I wouldn’t,” I said, and we all laughed. What else could we do.

We talked theories for the next few hours. What these aliens were doing, what they needed the fuel for. A couple times Margo or Ted would head to the controls and try to deviate from our path or change our speed, but it was clear we were in the power of something else.

Despite it all. I actually had a good time. We had human need for levity in the face of death and we quickly found ourselves drunk and laughing in hysterics.

“Ok, brass tack’s everyone,” said Jin after some hours as the laughter cooled after a joke. “We can’t burn to death and that’s exactly what’s going to happen if we stay on this course. There’s no way we can make it quick by using the sun. Votes on cutting off the oxygen versus overriding the airlock?”

“Oxygen,” said Margo and we all agreed. Oxygen.

“Alrighty,” said Jin, and I smirked then. I did not think my death would be decided with an alrighty but after being in the fray so many years it felt right. I was surprised how well the crew was taking this. They were properly selected; there was no panic.

A couple minutes later Jin got up from the table. We didn’t realize he did it then, but over the next few minutes our breaths became shallower and shallower. “Wait,” said Margo. She was suddenly swaying. “Jin, did you already…” But before she could finish her sentence, she hit the floor hard.

There was terror in my mind for sure, but I did my best to ignore it. We typically don’t discover this until the final seconds of our lives, but the human mind is an expert in experiencing death. I remember for some reason then, drunk and oxygen deprived, I was thinking of waking up with the window open on a Sunday morning. It was a memory I had from high school. Birds singing, bells tolling. A girl’s arm gently curled on top of my chest. I was ready to die but just then something heavy hit the roof of the spacecraft.

Sparks burst from the control panels and materials flew from their compartments. But it wasn’t enough to keep me conscious. I fell to the floor and the world went dark.

I woke to a shade being drawn. Darkness and then white, unbearable light. It was the sunshade. I was still on the ship. Jin and Ted were on the floor both on their backs. I stood clumsily over them. “Guys!” I reached down to shake them but froze.

Their eyes were gone, and so were their brains beyond. Red, hollow sockets. These men had the eyes of jack-o-lanterns. “Fuck. Fuck!” I screamed.

“Shhhh.” My head snapped towards the source of the sound. Margo was standing at the porthole staring out into the sun.

“Margo?”

“It brings tears to my eyes every time. I mean just look at that.”

I could see the sun out the porthole, but I wasn’t blinded. “Why can I see?” I touched my eyes half expecting them to be gone.

“Because I want you to. But there are more important questions,” she whistled a peaceful melody, still not turning from the glass. “I want to share something you. This view. Come.”

I looked down at Ted and Jin. I had this horrible fear that my eyes were melting, too.

“What happened to Ted and Jin?”

“This is only supposed to be shared with one. It’s… a polite protocol.”

“What is?”

“Letting you know *why*. It’s a painful thing to have to wonder. At least one of you shouldn’t. One of you should know. And I’m going to tell you, starting at the beginning but keeping it brief.”

I said nothing.

“Look at all those stars,” I looked beyond the sun to where thousands of stars twinkled, and Margo continued. “Every creature I’ve ever encountered thinks it’s beautiful. Their world, the universe. And god… I do, too. Gorgeous,” she hissed. “Absolutely… gorgeous. If only this feeling could be bottled. Sold. Enforced. The scale of space, the beauty of it all makes greed and worldly power seem so silly.”

I shifted on my feet uneasily. I had a handgun for emergencies and started towards my locked drawer to grab it.

“You would think a species could evolve past such things. But that’s the fatal flaw poisoning the purity of all things. You see, even when life reaches the level of sentience to appreciate goodness and beauty it still can never leave nature behind.

The primal drive to accumulate power… the high that comes with it. The subjugating of the weak. The slaughtering of the unknown. The slaughtering of anything that could be a threat… All those basic instincts remain.”

Margo was still facing the window and I started thumbing the combination into the lock.

“Your species did not win its way to the top of the food chain with song and dance. There is no solar system where intelligence ever has. So, all who wonder at the natural world in which they inhabit are built in with the cruelty it requires to take it. To lay waste to the competition. And those instincts, and the need to implement them, can’t be erased. There is no technology or time elapsed from when we were beasts to rid us of our want to win at all costs.”

“Margo,” I stopped fiddling with the combination and looked at her back. “This is no time for philosophy.”

“I’m not philosophizing,” she turned then, and I blanched as I saw that her eyes were pupil-less orbs. Something swam in them like parasites. “I’m apologizing.”

“Wha—” I stuttered. She was one of them. An alien. Anything but human. “You can have it!” I shouted. “Take as much energy as you need. Please. Please.”

“Energy?” I realized Margo’s mouth wasn’t moving. She was slack-jawed. Her voice came from inside my head. “We’re not here for energy. I’m sorry, to you and your people.”

Suddenly the top of Margo’s head popped and a slick metal pole that had been coming from the roof slinked out. It paused in the ceiling creating a barrier from the vacuum of space. Margo’s body fell lifeless to the floor. Her eyeballs had been sucked into her skull just like Jin and Ted.

She had never been speaking. She’s been dead the whole time. Whatever spoke was what had been hiding behind the sun.

I thought about going to the comm station then. Its lights were still on, I could connect to the internet and send out a message to tell others—and I have. You’re reading it. But before I did, something seemed to call me to the window.

I could see some kind of obelisk structure nearly touching the sun. It was enormous with emerald lights shining down its length. But then I noticed it had something like tentacles that were reaching into the sun. Where they connected to the surface, angry storms of fire swirled.

I understood what they were apologizing for. The sun wasn’t being mined. No, the words of that thing rang in my head, *“the slaughtering of the unknown,”*

*“The slaughtering of everything that could be a threat.”*

I stared at the sun and from fear or beauty or both, I began to cry. They were increasing the sun’s activity. The solar storms suddenly all made sense. Soon our star would go supernova. The sun wasn’t being mined. No.

They were turning it into a [bomb.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thespookyplace/)
