The yellow light of dim, far-spaced-out streetlights glinted off the glossy black hood of my Durango as I turned onto Churchill Road. I glanced down at the GPS one more time to make sure I had the right address, and crept slowly down the lane, shining my spotlight along the row of tightly packed, single-story mobile homes. It honestly baffled me that a security contractor providing alarm responses could even get work in a shithole town like this, as if there was anything here worth stealing. But parking outside of empty houses, most likely disturbed by the incessant desert wind, still paid the bills.

I parked and hopped out, fingers looped through my duty belt, glancing around in confusion as I once again checked the map application on my phone. Before me stood ### Churchill Road, a few hundred square feet of empty, undeveloped hardtack. A few lonely sage bushes and a sole Juniper tree were the only signs of life. I sighed and decided to take a short walk, and checked the house numbers of the trailers adjacent to this plot. The presence of ### and ### confirmed that I was in the right spot, but unsurprisingly, none of the nearby homes had the “Protected by Safeguard Solutions” yard sign that is bundled with every “Peace of Mind” package.

Reluctantly, I pulled my handheld radio off my belt. There are few people whom I reserve as much spite for as our “dispatcher” Ann. A failed public safety call taker turned micro manager of the two or three rent-a-cops in the booming metropolis of Broken Hills. I grimaced as I keyed up the mic.

“Dispatch, November 56,” I hailed, a piece of me died every time I had to send my raspy voice out into the void with my company-issued, pseudo-military call sign.

“Go ahead,” The reply came back as terse as expected.

“Confirming the location as ### Churchill?”

“Copy that, that is the address entered by the customer,” Ann responded, after an irritated sigh.

I took a few seconds to consider my response. Once again, I shined my flashlight around the perimeter of the blank square of land. I couldn’t even fathom where the power source would be to supply the electricity for the security system. The moonless night chilled me to the bone as a harsh burst of wind dragged particles of sand over my face. I shivered, the trance-like state broken as my radio squawked to life yet again.

“Do you need me to dispatch the SO, or are we code 4?” Ann asked, her voice impatient.

“No, everything checks ok here,” I said through gritted teeth, “I’ll be continuing with my assigned patrol route.”

The rest of the night passed in a blur of mundanity. I enjoyed driving, but an 8-hour shift of doing anything can turn into torture. The glittering lights of the Gold Point Casino, the steady blinking of streetlights, and the twinkle of stars overhead combined and refracted like a kaleidoscope as I drifted from site to site, confirming doors were locked and fences secure. Despite the meager population of just over 5 digits, Broken Hills was not a charming rustic town. In a town with little more to do than drink and gamble, crime was a constant factor, so the gap in the market was filled by barely qualified security staff like me.

Rolling slowly down the main street, only the lights of the Casino and the Slot House lit the way. Boarded windows covering the old ice cream parlor, iron bars over the small drug store, and a blank painted-over surface where the cinema used to display colorful movie posters.

Growing up in an old, retired mining town was not easy. The town didn’t age with you; it died before you even graduated from high school. Almost all my classmates went off to faraway places to study or find better work, and a small number like me thought the armed forces would be just as enjoyable as the JROTC. Now, at the age of 22, with no prospects, no degree, no relationships, and no goals, I was somewhat jaded to the concept.

I parked as I reached the end of Main Street, just before the road turned off to the twisting dirt path that led to the derelict silver mine. I got out and sat on the hood, my shined boots scraping idly against the headlight, making incomprehensible shadow puppets against the asphalt. The orange glow of my Zippo reflected off the tin badge haphazardly pinned over my heart, as I took a slow drag, blowing the smoke slowly out of my nostrils. I threw my head back, feeling the tremors start to fade, the quiet ritual at the end of my shift always helped to still the pounding of machine gun fire echoing between my ears.

The lack of light pollution means our night skies are clear and pure, stars shone down at me, twinkling merrily against my own misery. As I gazed upward, my eye caught a different color to the crystal white of the constellations. A slowly pulsing purple light, small as a pinpoint, moving across the dark horizon. I tried to focus my gaze, but the new light kept getting fuzzier, blinking with increasing rapidity. It was hypnotic, each time the bright dot vanished, my eyes would leave behind a murky afterimage, only to be wiped away as it popped back into view.

In a few seconds, the light stopped flickering and held steady, bright and piercing. It wasn’t moving anymore either, just held petrified in the center of the night sky, just below the Big Dipper. Suddenly, the firmament was lit with a sudden burst of lavender light. I jumped out of my skin with fear, feeling the still-burning cigarette rolling out of my grip. My vision went blurry, and I felt myself falling backwards in slow motion.

I came to with a start, banging my head against the headrest of my driver’s seat. The sun was peaking slowly over the Quartz Mountain, stinging my bloodshot eyes. Blinking out of my stupor, I found with bewilderment and unease that I was sitting back inside my own vehicle, parked in front of the small office suite Safeguard Solutions called HQ. In a well-practiced maneuver, I engaged the parking brake and took the keys to turn back into Miss Ann before she could chirp at me over the radio again. I drifted in and out, thoughts still consumed with doubt as to how I even got here. The taste of tobacco in my mouth told me I had definitely had my nightly break, but what about the blinding light in the sky? As disturbed as I was, the mental fog of the sleep aides and a crisp beer put me to sleep like a baby, ready for 4 more days of the same old grind.

My dreams were uneasy, vague impressions of shadows, the cold desert and a flash of purple swirled through my delirium. When I woke, the sun was still a few minutes from setting, so I grabbed an energy drink, a granola bar, and took my time getting to work. By the time I walked up to the front desk, the night was black as tar, and 2 minutes until my shift began. Ann sat, stiffly upright, lips smacking on her chewing gum, eyeing me with slight disapproval. Her short bob of blonde hair under the office lights shone like a dirty golden halo.

“Good morning,” I muttered, signing my keys out on the clipboard she passed me.

“You’ll never guess what call day shift left pending for you,” she said, a slight smile twisting her cherry red lips.

I didn’t reply, just stared at her in expectant silence. Taking the cue, she continued.

“Another glass break alarm at Churchill, second night in a row,” she said, a slight accusatory tone creeping in, “I wonder if a more thorough check might be needed.”

I thought about telling her how nonsensical it was that a sandbox of empty desert could even have a glass break alarm, and how I didn’t appreciate her insinuating I couldn’t do an entry-level security job. But instead, reason and my own desire to avoid unnecessary conflict won out.

“Huh, weird,” I muttered, coughing on the last syllable, “I’ll check it out first thing.”

Spinning my keys, I strolled out of the building without another word. The creeping dread I had felt last night was returning in full force. I drove through town, at a slightly unreasonable 45 miles per hour, knowing damn well policy stated I follow all posted speed limits. But rolling past where Deputy Harvard sat transfixed on his phone at the intersection of 2nd and Rowland, I knew we had a mutual understanding as the sole travelers at this time of night. I once again took the turn onto Churchill, pulling up to the driveway like I had rehearsed it a million times. To my shock, gone was the barren, dusty ground, or rather, where the juniper tree had stood was now occupied by a dingy, beaten old aluminum trailer home.

Unlike the previous night, I sat motionless, gazing at the dark frame of the dwelling. I started to tremble inexplicably, knuckles white as I gripped the steering wheel. Barely 24 hours ago, I had walked directly through the empty space that was now plainly occupied. And worse still, I could see through my blinking amber lights that all the windows I could see were shattered across the dust, the shards glistening like dewdrops.

Without exiting my car, I immediately jumped back on the radio, requesting that the Sheriff’s Office respond as well due to signs of a break-in. I stayed petrified while I listened to the approaching screech of Deputy Harvard’s sirens. By the time he parked, I forced myself to stand stiffly outside the home, the engine block of the car firmly between me and the home I swore didn’t exist.

“Jordan, what’ve we got ‘ere?” the middle-aged, unimposing figure of the Deputy slurred through his heavy accent.

I explained how I had responded to this location for an alarm, neglecting to mention how vacant the location was last night, and he nodded slowly.

“Prolly the robbers thought they ought ‘a test out the systems first, see how long the response takes,” he murmured, scratching at his ample gut.

Nonchalantly, he approached, service weapon drawn, and pushed open the ajar door. Instinctively, I drew my own snub-nosed revolver and fell in as he made entry. I prayed that the home would be empty, the mere act of clearing the 2 or 3 rooms already causing my heart to beat through my cheap uniform polo. My body was searching with my light and gun, but in my mind, I was back on deployment, the smell of blood and gun smoke causing waves of nausea to wash over me.

The house itself was unremarkable, with a few framed photos of an average family of 3, a dog bowl by the entrance, and small decorative rugs covering every surface. But the whole place was devoid of life and sound, aside from our boots slipping over the floor slowly.

“Must’ve been spooked off,” Deputy Harvard concluded, holstering his gun with a snap, “All them valuables are here, hell even the safe looks alright to me.”

He said this, gesturing vaguely at the small TV set and the car keys strewn on the small kitchen counter. I thumbed through a stack of mail sitting on top of the toaster oven, all addressed to either of the Parsons, who were assumed to be the balding man and dour woman pictured in the framed photographs.

“Will the Sheriff’s department contact them?” I asked the uninterested public servant, who was already halfway out the door.

“Oh yeah sure, detectives will come and clean this mess out Monday morning.”

As the Deputy wandered back to his patrol car to call it in, I took one more glance around the house, a nagging feeling that something was wrong deep in my stomach. The wind howled through the empty windows, making a low moan of a pained animal as I looked from one to another. As I thought, every single window in the house was shattered beyond repair, but strangely, there wasn’t a glass splinter anywhere in the carpet. With growing certainty, I believed the windows had broken from the inside, as remarkable as that was.

*Who the hell breaks into a house, just to steal nothing, and break all their windows?*

With a sudden pang, I had to support myself on the kitchen counter as my head split with pain. Unlike the trauma bringing back phantom smells earlier, I now knew I was breathing in a cloying, ammonia-like aroma that made me sway forward and back on my feet. Then once again, I was falling.

But I didn’t feel the sudden stop of the tile floor meeting my back, instead, it felt like I was sinking deeper and deeper into the ocean, my vision blurring with vibrant explosions of color, and my head bursting with pain. Terror filled my mind; I was certain I was about to die. Through the murky darkness covering my sight, a hand reached out towards my face. Its clawed, jagged fingers terminating in small circular orifices. Panic consumed me as I counted 4 hideous, evenly spaced fingers as they closed around my mouth, the slimy grip pinching down on my flesh.

I tried to scream, but a cold tendril slipped down my throat, choking me as my mouth filled with the same disgusting sulfur I smelled earlier. It felt like my jaw was being wrenched apart by the impossibly strong grip, small pinpricks of pain covering every surface those loathsome fingers touched, like it was wrapped in sharpened needles. I raised my hand and feebly started hitting at the clammy arm that extended from the hand that manipulated my head into contortionist poses.

The paramedic yelled at me in surprise as I tried to batter him off me, oxygen mask clutched in his outstretched hand. I could see the street blurring behind us through the ambulance window, feel the cold paper stretched across the gurney I rested on. My unsettling vision had vanished as quickly as a light being switched on, and I could just barely choke out a question.

“What happened?”
