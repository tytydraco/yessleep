"Holy SHIT!" Liam shouted.

"We have to lock the doors!" Brian yelled. He ran to the entrance doors to flip the locks...but then saw that they locked only by key. He looked at us, frantic. "Keys! We need keys!"

I ran to the register, where the mustached clerk was still sitting, completely nonchalant and seemingly oblivious to the commotion we were causing. "We need your keys!" I screamed at him.

Once again, he made no indication that he even heard a single word I'd said. Just nodded his head, smirked slightly, and turned a page in his magazine.

I snapped, partially from fear, partially from frustration. "LISTEN, GODDAMMIT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT--"

I reached across the counter and grabbed him by the collar of his shirt, intending to shake him.

What happened next was something I was completely unprepared for.

There was a strange sound -- *frrrrumph*! -- and the clerk..*.seemed to collapse inward, implode upon himself.* It happened in a split-second. He just kind of...*deflated*, like a balloon. What was left of him dropped soundlessly to the floor, an empty skin-suit still inside his clothes.

"FUCK!" I screamed, unable to believe what I had just witnessed.

My three friends, still gathered at the entrance, focused on the approaching crowd, hadn't seen what had just happened to the 'clerk.'

"Come on, man, hurry up, they're getting closer!" Tony shouted at me in desperation.

I snapped out of my shock and knelt down, rummaging through the deflated man -- or whatever the hell it had been's -- clothes. I inadvertently made contact with the skin...except it didn't feel like skin. It felt rubbery, synthetic.  I found a keyring in the front jeans pocket.

"Here, catch!" I hollered and tossed the keys across the store to Brian.

He caught them and began frantically trying them in the entrance door lock.

The faceless...things...in the parking lot were only a few yards away from the store.

"Come on, come on!" Brian murmured urgently, trying one key after the other.

"They're almost here!" Tony screamed hysterically.

Brian tried another key...another...another.

The first of the faceless people slammed its body against the glass door.

Tony and Liam threw their own bodies against it from inside, trying to hold them shut for Brian.

Brian tried another key...the right key. It slid home with a click. Brian stepped back from the door, breathing heavily.

The faceless creatures pounded against the locked door.

"Can they smash through that?" Liam asked nervously.

"No, it's probably shatter-resistant safety glass," Brian panted. "I think we're safe...for now, anyway."

They pounded against the door for a couple more minutes, then, seeming to realize it was useless, gave up and backed away, but remained standing outside, facing (pardon the expression) the store.

"What the fuck do we do now?" Tony asked, looking at us, scared.

I pointed across the store to a steel door labeled EMERGENCY EXIT in the wall opposite the entrance. "We can slip out the back and make a run for the car. Then--"

"No," Liam cut me off, shaking his head. "Don't you remember? I'm almost out of gas. Even if we made it, we wouldn't get very far."

"And we sure as hell can't gas up with those things out there," Brian added. He glanced at the faceless figures waiting motionless outside the store and shuddered.

"Shit. We're trapped." Tony muttered.

"What the fuck are they? What is wrong with this place? What's going *on* here?" Brian wondered out loud.

"Let's see if there's a phone here, we can call the police," I suggested.

We trooped back to the front counter. The others reacted to the shriveled remains of the 'clerk.'

"What...the...fuck?" Brian half stated/half asked in amazement.

"He just kind of...flattened out... when I touched him," I explained with a shrug.

"Freaky shit," Tony said in awe.

We looked around but there was no phone on the counter.

"What about in there?" Liam pointed to an open door behind the register, a small manager's office.

We stepped inside. There was a desk, and a computer monitor with a CCTV grid-screen displaying various camera views of the gas station, interior and exterior. Next to the monitor was a phone stand with a cordless handset.

"Bingo!" Brain exclaimed triumphantly.

I grabbed the handset and dialed 911. We listened as the phone rang...and rang...and rang. Much longer than it should have for an emergency number. Finally, there was a click as the call connected.

A voice spoke from the other end. Not the calm, professional voice of a 911 dispatcher asking for the address and the nature of the emergency. No, this voice was...wrong. It was an unnaturally low, deep, grating voice. It might have been a male voice; but it was difficult to say for certain. It didn't sound human. It had an unpleasant quality to it that I can only describe as...squirmy. Like a bag full of snakes slithering over each other. It made my blood curdle. The horrible, crawling voice sounded like it was reciting some kind of poem, or maybe a song.

*"What say, Jimmy-Jack? I seem to see a baseball bat. Shadows creeping across the sun. Lost his head in '41. Wagon wheels full of mud. Lincoln's eyes are dripping blood...."*

I slammed the phone down before I could hear anymore. I looked at my friends. They had heard the voice too and had all gone pale. We regarded each other in silence.

Brian broke the tableau. He marched back to the entrance and stared out at the faceless horde waiting patiently outside. He suddenly pounded on the glass. "WHAT DO YOU WANT?" he shouted furiously. "JUST WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU *WANT*?"

One of them, wearing a white T-shirt and overalls, stepped deliberately up to the glass and slowly raised a finger, pointing it at us.

It was answer enough: *You.*

"Maybe we should--" Liam began but never finished. There was a sudden sound from the other end of the store. A perfectly commonplace sound we've all heard a dozen times a day throughout our lives. The sound of a toilet flushing.

In unison, and seemingly in slow motion, we turned our heads in the direction the sound had come from. Two doors that had previously gone unnoticed. One marked WOMEN, one marked MEN. Public restrooms. The sound had come from the men's room.

"Someone's in there," Tony said pointlessly.

"Tony, please shut the fuck up," Brian told him emotionlessly.

We stood like statues, watching the men's room door. Seconds passed.

Slowly, the men's room door opened.

Its occupant emerged, crouching low to clear the doorway, then standing straight.

Whatever we might have been expecting, whatever horror our minds could have possibly conceived, it wasn't any of them.

It was impossibly tall, at least eight feet, and thin. Completely naked with bright yellow skin that was smooth and featureless. Its anatomy was void of any detail; it didn't even seem to possess genitals. Its hands were too big, fingers too long, and its feet were just shoe-shaped lumps without toes. Its head, also yellow, was perfectly round and totally bald.

And its face...

Unlike the things outside, it *did* possess a face, more or less. And it was distinctive and instantly recognizable.

A cartoon smiley face.

It was a living, eight-foot-tall smiley face figurine.

It stared at us and we stared at it, speechless. It was such a bizarre, absurd moment that it was impossible to even react to it. It was like a darkly humorous scene from an otherwise intense horror movie.

Suddenly the top three quarters of the smiley face man's head unhinged and fell back, exposing a six-inch horizontal gap lined top and bottom with rows of long, white, needle-pointed fangs.

"Oh shit," Tony said in a soft, dazed voice.

With a warbling, unearthly shriek, the thing charged at us with frightening speed.

*"RUN!"* Liam screamed.

We scattered in a panic, Tony and Brian fleeing in one direction, me and Liam fleeing in another. The direction Liam and I took happened to take us towards the door marked EMERGENCY EXIT.

Liam pushed it open. As we ran outside, I heard a high-pitched, undulating scream of terror and mayhem behind us. I couldn't tell if it was coming from Tony or Brian.

We were outside, in back of the gas station, sprinting across the parking lot and ducking behind a dumpster.

The screaming abruptly stopped.

We peered around the edge of the dumpster, hearts racing, watching the store, waiting to see who - or *what* \- was going to appear in the open doorway. But the doorway remained empty.

Liam reacted with a start, looking around, as if suddenly realizing our friends weren't with us. "Tony! Brian!" he called out, alarmed.

I clamped my hand over his mouth. "Shut up, you idiot!" I hissed at him. "Those things will hear you!"

"But Brian and Tony! We have to go back for them!"

"They're gone, Liam. We go back in there, we're dead too."

"Jesus," he breathed with a horrified whimper. "What are we going to do?"

"We have to get out of here."

"And go *where*?"

"There's only one place *to* go," I gestured toward the darkness surrounding the gas station.

"Are you fucking insane? We don't know *what* could be out there!"

We can't go back in the gas station and we're sitting ducks hiding here. We gotta take our chances."

"Maybe we can sneak back to the car. There's still a little gas left. Maybe enough to get us a couple more miles--"

"It's too risky. Those faceless freaks are still out front."

"I'm not going out there on foot!"

"Then stay here and die," I told him, fed up. "I'll go on my own."

I got up and headed for the edge of the parking lot.  Liam hesitated for a few seconds, then I heard him scurry after me. "Wait up!"

At the edge, we paused with some reluctance, exchanging a look of fearful trepidation. Liam's words echoed in my mind: *We don't know* what *could be out there*. But staying here was certain death. We stepped out of the perimeter of the "clearing" that surrounded the gas station...into the thick, fog-like darkness beyond.
