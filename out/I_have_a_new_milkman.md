I grew up in a small culdesac in a suburban area full of detached houses. Everyone was on friendly terms and almost all were young families. The other children and I would play games together on the safe street after all only people who lived there would drive into the dead end culdesac. It was very peaceful and pleasant. That was until the milkman changed.



Every other day a big bottle of fresh milk was delivered to every door in the culdesac from a local farm. I vividly remember the giddy feeling I had as a child when I left the empty bottle out in the evening only for it to be replaced as if by magic the following morning. It was like a miniature Christmas to me. One day I set an alarm and woke up in the early morning in order to pull open my curtains and wait for the milkman to arrive. A silent electric powered milk float eventually pulled into the culdesac. The float was laden with trays upon trays of bottle white milk which quietly clinked together as he drove. The milkman looked tired but cheerful as he went about his task. When he came to our front door I opened my window and called out a greeting. The milkman was startled and dropped our bottle onto the pavement. He looked up at me. The man’s face was round, red and kind. A brief scowl or irritance disappeared when he saw me looking down at him in awe. He quietly tipped his cap to me before retrieving a fresh bottle or milk.



My parents scolded me when they found the note the milkman had left on our milk bottle. I accepted their discipline but couldn’t help but feel elated when they gave me the note. 



“Sorry for the glass, I don't carry a sweeper. Your young lad gave me a fright when he called out this morn. All the best. Milkman.”



I cherished the piece of communication and kept it in my bedside drawer. My parents seemed perplexed at my obsession but did not deter me. With pride I relayed the tale to my school mates and the other children in the culdesac. Some shared my excitement but others mocked my passion. I got into a scrape with an older boy who called me a cruel name over the whole affair. Nursing a few pains I elected to renew my spirits by waking up early for the milkman once again.



The milk float pulled into the culdesac and somehow seemed quieter than it had the first time. None of the trays in the back made a sound either. I felt strange when I saw the milkman step out from the float. He was much taller than the last time. When he walked his legs seemed to bend outwards slightly as if they were too long. Across the road I watched the tall milkman approach the front door and place down two fresh milk bottles. He then picked up the empty bottle but he had his back to me. When the milkman turned around the empty bottle was gone. His cap was pulled low in front of his face. As he came to approach our door I reached for the handle to open my window but paused. Something instinctual warned me against making myself known. The tall milkman placed two bottles of fresh milk on our doorstep; we only ever received one at a time before. Then I watched as a thin fingered hand picked up our empty bottle of milk and raised it to the obscured face of the milkman. From behind the window I heard the quiet crunch, crunch, crunch as the milkman ate the glass bottle.



My parents did not believe me and added the delivered milk to their coffee and breakfast cereal. When I refused to drink my glass of milk or eat my cereal they became infuriated. I went to school that morning with a sore bottom but that did not shake my sense of unease. I sought out the children at school who lived on my culdesac and they confirmed that an extra bottle of milk had been delivered to their doors that morning. Not only that, they explained, with a smile on their faces, that it was the sweetest milk they had ever drank.



Everyone acted differently that evening and the day after. My parents treated me with great kindness professing their love for me in uncomfortably vulnerable conversations. Father wept that he would never strike me again and only did so because it was how he had been raised. Mother held me tightly pressed against her as if she wanted me back in her stomach again. When I escaped their strange clutches the games outside were not any better. The culdesac gang as we dubbed ourselves were in equally odd spirits. Instead of war they wanted to play games of peace. They skipped around in a circle holding hands for at least ten minutes and I watched on with a frown. It was no fun at all. 



Three bottles of milk were sitting on our doorstep. That was what the label claimed the contents were but I was disgusted at the grey thick liquid within. My parents slurped it down all the same. When I refused to have any there was no angry response, just a quiet acceptance. Everyone at school acted like copies of one another. The lessons became difficult. Our teacher drew complicated diagrams with numbers above what I could count on the blackboard and asked questions. Everyone’s hand went up to respond except mine. I walked home with some of the neighbour’s children every day but soon they began to walk in a strange line and did not talk about TV shows or games anymore. 



Four bottles of black milk were sitting on our doorstep. My parents stopped talking and drank an entire bottle each before heading off to work. I decided to stay at home and I don’t think they even noticed. Everyone was turning into robots. The TV stopped showing anything fun. All the channels showed lines of strange symbols and made a weird ticking noise that hurt my ears. I began to feel so lonely. Nobody forced me but in the end I decided to drink the milk. After that everything felt better. 



I am happy now and you will be too once the new milkman starts his rounds where you live.
