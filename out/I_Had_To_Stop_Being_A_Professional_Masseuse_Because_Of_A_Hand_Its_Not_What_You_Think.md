This happened a long time ago.

I had just started working as a masseuse then. Masseuses have long, tiring days, and my wrists were often sore. I would pause before starting with a new client, regain the strength of my arms, and begin.

I had started with home visits. They pay well, though it was always a bit daunting to visit a new house. This particular visit was booked by a young client who used to come to the clinic once in a while. She had long, black, thick hair that she used to tie up as I massaged her head. It had a somewhat unpleasant texture — as it used to slip over my hand it felt like a rubber rope.

However, that was a small unpleasantness that hardly mattered. I went to her home in the evening that day, I remember. She lived in a very large, beautiful Art Deco apartment in the older part of the city, with lush green plants trailing  over cream colored balconies. I walked in with a slight hesitation that I have always felt , entering a stranger’s home.

My client was as usual, quiet and polite, sitting up in a large hardbacked chair from her dining table. The angle was a bit unfamiliar, so I first began to pass my fingers across her scalp to understand how to position my fingers. She had opened her hair, so it lay over the back of her chair.

As I put my fingers in and passed them through, I had a very odd sensation. It felt like my fingers were being met by a cold hand from the other side. As I passed my hand up, it felt exactly as though someone was passing their hand in to meet mine.

I hurriedly removed my hands and paused for a minute. the client must have thought I was just taking a breather. She didn’t say anything. I realised the minute was extending too long and I tried again — only to feel the tips of icy fingers meeting my own!

I can’t describe what passed through my mind at that instant. I jumped back, only for my client to look back as well, in surprise. She was a pale woman, and I distinctly remember her startled black eyes peering into my own.

‘What happened? Are you dizzy?’

I said my apologies, that I had been taken over by faintness, and ran away.

The young woman never came again. I had been scared of her coming and complaining, but she never returned. Sadly, she died a year or two later, the spa’s owner told me. I had left the place and the job by then.

I’ve tried many times, to make sense of what happened that day. I remember her languid face and a sort of charm or pendant she had, that used to lurk near her neck. Years later I saw a similar one online. When I googled it, it turned out to be a tabeez or charm against a djinn, a male spirit entranced by female hair. And I remembered the long hair that would coil like a snake around my wrist. I remembered its slightly repellent texture, how it swooshed through my fingers. I remembered how she never called for an explanation, never visited the place again. The only cure for a djinn’s fixation is death. Poor woman.
