I live in the backwoods, an isolated cottage in the deep forest. A nearly empty 100 mile wide and 100 mile long forest with a huge network of winding empty gravel roads.

I work in the city and have quite the commute, While I was driving home for the weekend, just after leaving the final town, I heard a loud thud, a speeding car had overtook me, narrowly missing me, at what must have great speed. I blanked out temporarily and continued driving. 'Close Call', I thought to myself.

I continued my commute to my backwoods house, not seeing another single car. Which was normal for a deep fores, even during the day.

When I got home, I was surprised that the power went out. No worries, my phone was charged and I had a UPS. 'I got this'. I slept and woke up, clear blue skies, but the electricity was still out. 

Now you might wonder how an isolated cottage in the forest has electricity, well you know those huge transformer power lines, they cut through the forest. My house is directly underneath them, so I conveniently have an electric connection.

Since then, the electricity never came on, I called my electric company, but the call just went through, no voicemail or anything, it just keeps on ringing indefinitely, this happened to every single other contact I tried, my friends, family, and landlord.

Now you might wonder how come an isolated cottage in the forest has mobile services, well you Starlink, well, I got that.

I have lost my desire for food and water, yet I haven't lost a single kg of weight in the last week. I no longer feel cold or warm, I'm in shorts all the time and feel normal.  I think I may be experiencing dementia or something. 

Well, the weekend was over and I had to go back to work, I got in my car and followed the gravel road that runs parallel to the huge power lines. I had a full gas of tank, 'lets go'. I kept driving, usually it would take 40 minutes of driving the dirt road to reach the paved highway, that leads into the city. Yet, I kept driving, kept driving for 80 minutes until I reached back to my house. 'WTF', guess I'll head southwards and hit the other main road, kept driving, winded up back to my house. 

My tank was nearly empty by the time I reached home, I switched off the car and headed inside.

Goddammit, there goes my job I thought, not realizing at the time that I had a much bigger problem. My UPS had run out and now my phone was at 99 % battery. At-least I got internet, I can send an email for help. I contacted the police and all my friends/family on their email address. No response, its definitely sent, the sent category in my inbox shows so. I tried posting on reddit for help, but when I logout, I see that I have been shadow-banned. I cannot hear any bird chirping outside my house, come to think about it, I didn't even see any rabbits for the last week, usually they run in front of your car whilst driving.

My phone is now at 1%. I better submit this before my phone dies, I'll edit it and update you guys when I figure out what happening. All the knives and ropes in my house disappeared, come to think about it, they disappeared since last week.
