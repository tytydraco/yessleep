 I can still remember my dad’s reaction to the Halloween flier and, how, in hindsight, he was maybe kind of right. If we had just done everything like they always had, this might not have ever happened.

The flier read: LIFESPRING CHURCH FALL FESTIVAL AND “TRUNK OR TREAT”. A SAFE ALTERNATIVE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!

“Trunk or treat? What the hell is this?” my dad asked.

“It’s like where the parents park their cars and you go around to them and collect 

“My God,” he said, and leaned his head back with his hand across his brow like he was about to faint. “And I suppose they did this because regular trick or treating is too ‘dangerous’, hmm?”

“I guess.” 

“I tell you if this don’t beat all I’ve ever seen. You know what this is? This is just another example of the sissification of this country. Halloween used to mean something. The whole community coming together for some mild mischief and spooky cheer. Not a bunch of cars in a freaking parking lot, for crying out loud.

“What are you going to do, walk around the perimeter of a parking lot? Where’s the fun in that? Halloween used to be about roaming the neighborhood, covering miles in a single night, filling a pillow case. You had to *work* for that candy. Now this? This is just teaching y’all to get handouts. No work or nothing. Congratulations, America! You did it. You gave Halloween its own version of a participation trophy.”

I waited a while to make sure his rant was over. He continued grumbling indecipherable sounds as he scanned the flier. 

“Well . . .can I go?”

Dad waved a dismissive hand. “I ain’t stopping you.”  

Growing up, my parents weren’t really religious. They may have believed in a Christian God or something like it, but it was only in the vaguest or easiest of ways. Point being, we never went to church.

“Why should I waste part of my weekend, getting all dressed up and sitting in an uncomfortable seat and getting bored?” Dad would reckon.

How I’d started going to this Lifespring church was because of  my buddy, Kyle. It was nothing like the traditional church my dad had in mind. We could wear jeans and tennis shoes. The chairs were actually kinda comfy—not pews, but padded, stackable chairs, the kind you saw at hotels and event centers. 

It was a big, non-denominational church that had taken up refuge in an old Sears department store. A megachurch, they called it. I started going frequently, usually as a function of a Saturday sleepover at Kyle's house. The services were never boring. A live band with electric guitars and drums blasted contemporary Christian music at us from a stage flanked by two large projector screens. Song lyrics scrolled by on the screens and sometimes there were funny video sketches playing up there. The pastor paced around excitedly during his sermons, wearing a microphone headset and sprinkling in jokes throughout. 

And every Sunday, they had a smorgasbord of free donuts. Whatever else they could do to sweeten the deal, bribing heathens with long johns and donut holes. 

I had never had a particular affinity for the old-school version of Halloween that my dad had described. Trick or treating in our neighborhood had always been kind of lackluster. With half the houses having their porch lights off, driveways empty, and their front doors shuttered, the walk-to-candy ratio was severely lacking. So despite what my dad had to say about the whole thing, I was looking forward to the Trunk-or-Treat festivities. It was likely shaping up to be the best Halloween I’d ever had in all of my twelve years of living. 

The location was about as festive as you could make an asphalt parking lot. There were a few hay bales scattered here and there, serving as anchors for crafty scarecrows. Inflatable yard decorations fluttered in the autumnal breeze, skeletons and jack-o-lanterns and Halloween themed Snoopies. A moon bounce castle loomed in the distance. Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” floated from a PA system across the lot, interrupted intermittently by a cheery emcee giving announcements as to when the costume and pumpkin carving contest judging would be held. All the while various costumed kids of all sizes meandered across the lot. Darth Vaders and princesses and Power Rangers and zombies and ghosts and superheroes and mermaids.   

I had decided to go as Napoleon Dynamite. Kyle was supposed to match up with me as Kip, but had bailed at the last minute, deciding that coordinating costumes was "totally gay". Instead he wore some generic Wal-Mart grim reaper costume.   costume. It was just as well. I already had prescription glasses as part of my ensemble. After putting my black hair in my mom’s Hot Stick curlers, I looked more like Weird Al Yankovic wearing a “Vote for Pedro” shirt. 

We entered into a sea of cars and vehicles all parked in rows with their trunks, hatchbacks, and tailgates popped open. You had to hand it to the parents. Many of them had gone all out for the occasion, decorating the ass end of their cars and trucks rear ends in elaborate displays.

Paper mache and Styrofoam teeth mounted to the lids of trunks, creating the gaping mouths of a shark, a dragon, a troll. A VW Beetle had transformed into a ladybug. A ford Mustang became a mustang, a horsetail hanging from the open trunk (giving ghastly implications as to where the candy was coming from). One man turned the back of his truck into a pirate ship, served us grog with an “arrgh matey” from a construction paper wrapped cooler. In imagination, the ice chest was a treasure chest and in reality the grog was simply root beer. 

Another car was manned by clowns (the friendly kind, not the maniacal bloodthirsty versions from horror films) and it was all such a good time and I was getting so much candy and goodies, that I was beginning to realize my dad’s earlier rant about this thing was completely off base. What did he know? 

It couldn’t have been more perfect. The sun was still hanging halfway in the sky, shining brightly through the autumn leaves. Bright blue sky and chilled autumn breeze. A din of excited chatter. Laughing children. Popcorn smell floating on the breeze. Caramel stuck to my teeth. And the way the cars kept going on and on and my candy bucket runneth over. 

We must’ve been coming to the end of the line, the noise of the festival muted and now far behind us. The edge of the parking lot coming into view, untamed brush and overgrown grasses meeting cracked concrete. Parked all by itself underneath a naked, twisted tree was a shiny black Cadillac, an older model. Sleek with rounded edges. Nearby, a tall man in a black suit and top hat leaned against a shovel. He was dressed as an undertaker, parked way out on the edge of everything. Here to scare some kids, no doubt. 

Some little kids—three of them to be precise—had gone off by themselves and we could see them milling about near the black vehicle. They were without parental supervision and why not? This was a church parking lot. What was the worst that could happen?

“Who’s that guy?” I asked.

“Beats me,” Kyle said. “Looks like he’s got a sick setup. C’mon, let's go check it out. Might be the only actual scary one at the whole thing.”

The younger kids sprinted away from the black vehicle in a sudden panic, screams blaring from their wide open mouths, tears streaming down their faces. Genuine terror on their two little faces. 

“Must be legit,” Kyle said. 

*Two little faces*.

“Where’s the other kid?” I asked.

“Huh?”

“I thought there were three kids down there.”

We were upon the vehicular display. The man was tall and gangly, the suit sleeves swallowing his thin wrists. He must’ve bought it a size or two too large to give him that illusion. His cheeks were sunken and dark lines traced the contours of his face, like they had been carved in. Dark circles underneath his eyes, and flap of skin folded over from his cheek, revealing a moist, gray wound bed. 

“Welcome, welcome,” he rasped. 

"Awesome effects," Kyle said, and he just wasn't referring to the man's makeup. 

On closer inspection, the black Cadillac's trunk looked like nothing vehicular, metal giving away to a shiny black hide like that of a whale. Rows of teeth were not constructed of paper mache or craft supplies, but rather something like thick ivory, a pair of large, glistening fangs on the upper and lower jaws. 

And the interior of the trunk, not fabric or any other such material, but wet pink mucus membrane, a thick red tongue snaking out from some cavernous blackness deep within. Rank stench of death wafting across the short distance we kept from the display. 

“Holy shit, look at that thing,” Kyle said, peering closer.

“Kyle, dude. I think we should head back.”

Back toward the crowd, the din of festive chatter had shifted into a tense vibe. Voices reached a sharp register. A woman saying, “Where’s Bobby?” 

The PA system boomed louder than it had all day, an authoritative voice asking, “Will Bobby Carter please report to the canopy tent.”

“You boys want a treat?” the man asked in a voice as dry as bone dust. 

He had somehow flanked us, the arm holding the shovel was outstretched, corralling us toward the trunk of the Cadillac. I closed my eyes and shook my head, hoping that the illusion would be gone as soon as I opened them.

“It’s got drool and everything. And is it breathing?” Kyle was really close now. 

The PA system announcing again, “We’d also like to add little Stevie Driscoll to the list. Bobby Carter and Stevie Driscoll, please report to the canopy tent.”

I ducked my head under the handle of the shovel, stepped back from the trunk.

“Kyle, let’s *go*.”

“Natasha Stephens please come to the canopy tent. Five cars down from the moon bounce. I repeat Natasha Stephens. Stevie Driscoll. If anybody can look around for a pink Power Ranger, a Batman, and a firefighter, please guide them to the reunification area.”

The trunk closed, mousetrap fast. All I could see left of Kyle were the bottoms of his tennis shoes, his legs draped out from underneath his costume robe, kicking frantically. There was no sound, no scream, or nothing. That’s how fast it was. The trunk mouth opened partially again, the teeth now crimson stained, something meaty and glistening caught in between the gaps. Kyle’s legs were pulled further inward. A shoe fell off. The sock clad foot the last thing I saw before I turned screaming as loud as I could, rushing with everything I had back to the adults.

“He’s killing them! He’s killing them!” I shrieked, my voice cracking into a thousand different pubescent pieces, until it was just a high pitched wail. “Black Cadillac! Black Cadillac! Down towards the back!” My candy bucked long dropped and spilled on the sidewalk, legs pistoning and pumping myself toward someone that could help.

“Ladies and gentleman, we have a situation. We ask that everyone gather their children and remain in place. Do not leave the parking lot. I repeat, do not leave the parking lot!”

Screams rose up across the rows of car like some sort of guided wave chant at a major league baseball game. Kids crying. Moms crying. Sirens. 

“What’s that Justin? You know where the kids are?” the pastor asked me as I got to the canopy tent. 

“Where’s Natasha? Where is *she?”* a hysterical woman pleaded to me, crowding into my space. 

The pastor held up his hand to let me speak, gestured for someone to hold the mother back.

“He’s in a black Cadillac, down there,” I pointed. “He killed Kyle. His trunk did. He’s in there.”  
 “Now hold on a minute. What do you mean, killed Kyle?”

“Look man, we don’t have time. He’s going to get away. He has the kids. Something bad is going to happen.”

It was only in hindsight that I could begin to put some of the pieces together as to what happened next. The hysterical mother had set off toward where I was pointing, followed by others. A tall man in a cap and western shirt with a get-shit-done attitude lurked on the fringes. I don’t know if I saw him in the moment or my memory simply placed him there a long time after. After the news articles and photos. 

But there was pandemonium and it was all swirling around me. Panicked parents and confused children. The deadly black car making its way to the exit, trailed by a group of festival attendees. The shouts that erupted at this scene. 

“He’s getting away!”

“Stop him!”

The engine revved and tires peeled out from somewhere a few vehicles down. A Jolly Roger flagpole clattered to the ground and if I thought the screams were tense before, they didn’t compare to what followed in the wake of the truck as it accelerated across the parking lot in a blind fury toward the black Cadillac.

He was getting away. There was no time to watch for pedestrians, it seemed. The kids and parents making their way back to the safe spots as directed were only in the way. 

At least the man in the truck stopped the Cadillac, though. A loud crash followed by busted radiator steam. The black car’s hood crumpled, its windshield shattered, and the unconscious driver dragged from the driver’s seat and set upon by the mob. 

And minutes after, four kids came walking out from the brush at the far side of the parking lot.

Bobby Carter, Natasha Stephens, Stevie Driscoll, and my best friend Kyle. 

They were untouched and unharmed. At least until they stumbled upon the carnage after: the strewn bodies of injured trick or treaters, the bloodied heads and frantic parents, the kid in the skeleton costume with his real bone sticking out from his skin and pants, the dad performing CPR on his dying wife—she was dressed as an angel.

Fortunately, none of the kids died. All of our thoughts and prayers the following Sunday must’ve really worked for them. 

The mom in the angel costume. She spent a week on life support. All of our thoughts and prayers for her must’ve fallen on deaf ears. 

I don’t really understand how any of that works. I don’t think anybody does.

 Not even God.

Months later, my dad felt comfortable enough to offer his two cents on the whole ordeal. He knew that I had seen a lot and I guess that it was thoughtful of him to not say anything directly after the accident, but in the end, I guess he just couldn’t help himself.

“I just knew something like this would happen. A bunch of kids roaming around a parking lot? Anybody could show up. Pretend like they’re part of the group. Throw kids in trunks. Get everybody all riled up. Lucky that he didn’t run off with any of them.

“ And do you know that cars running over children in parking lots is one of the leading causes of accidental deaths in kids? Things just aren't like they used to be, I tell ya.”

What was it though? Was the world being sissified or were things much crazier and dangerous nowadays?

I didn’t bother asking him.

In our town, they did away with trunk-or-treats. It was just too dangerous, they said. Better to just do it the old fashioned way. Wear reflective clothing. Only stick to neighborhoods you know. Bring a flashlight. Don't accept baked goods. And as always, the local police station was there to x-ray your candy if need be.
