 

I sincerely enjoy reading about scary stories, and watching scary videos and scary movies but sometimes human stupidity makes me so fucking angry. Why do people want to provoke anything that is, I don't know how to put it, not alive? Supernatural? Paranormal? Dead? Whatever is there does not want to be disturbed in my opinion. And I feel like most of the time it is provoked.

So I ran across this channel on youtube, BizarreBub, I'm sure some of you are familiar. He basically makes scary compilations of real events. So I'm watching the videos, and there's a woman who's a tarot reader, I'm already annoyed at this point as I know it's gonna be the ladies fault if anything happens to her. I know it sounds really rude but it's my experience with anything containing trying to get in touch with the other side or whatever. So she's a tarot reader but this time she decides to contact spirits via a Ouija board. And literally provokes the spirit. Chanting stuff like ''Open the door'' and ''Come stand in front of the mirror'' etc. She was also filming a live video for entertainment purposes although this one I did not find amusing.

I used to be into tarot cards and tarot readings. One of my friends told me numerous times to cut it out since It's the devil's work and it's occultism. I did not believe him and just continued to mess around. It was going good. I was reading people right, I kind of ''felt'' with the cards I can say. So this one time I bring them to the same friends house, and there's another friend there. He's telling me the same stuff I've already heard before, but ultimately decides he wants me to do him a reading. A minute into the reading I ask him ''Are your parents divorced?'' I don't know why but I just felt like it, even though the cards showed fairly good things. He immediately got spooked but we continue for a little while.

After we're done with the reading we're just chilling, hanging out when all of a sudden my friends router just falls face down on the floor. It was literally impossible. He was like ''get those cards out i don't care'' which is completely understandable. We're all Christians so it's really against our beliefs to even think about playing with that stuff. He literally went and put the cards on the terrace just so they would be as away from the inside of his apartment as possible. So next time I use them is in my own apartment to some friends, I get their readings on point, they were amazed but I was feeling uneasy.

Nothing in particular happened but I just remember throwing them in my closet as soon as they left because I was scared AF, can't really tell myself why tho. I literally waited for my boyfriend to finish his night shift, until 6AM with the lights turned on. I also noticed that anytime I would watch a reading online or get caught up in anything spiritual bad things would happen. Not paranormal, but bad things, fights, drama, arguments, illnesses...

So yeah I started to strongly believe that no one should play around and mess with the spirits, good or bad. That can only bring misfortune. I've had a few scary things happen in my life but nothing haunting in particular, but these card made me feel the most uneasy than anything I've experienced. So whatever happened to this lady from the video, she was basically asking for it. I believe that this shit messes with your head and willpower, and just your overall well being. I'm open for second opinions and questions, but my advice: Don't go looking for the devil.

I'm also thinking about throwing them away or burning them but I'm kinda scared of doing that, so I'm just leaving them be for now.
