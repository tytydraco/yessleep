I used to wake up to the lights flickering.

Not just blinking… flickering. Like candlelight on a wall, like something alive and stuttering. It always happened around 3:12 a.m., though I never set an alarm to check. My body just knew.

Grace said it was nothing. Wiring issues. Maybe a power surge. But we both knew better.

The lights only flickered after the funeral.

It wasn’t a normal funeral. Grace never wanted one, not really. She was always halfway out of this world anyway; never big on ceremonies or flowers or the polite way people grieve. She wanted ash and sea and silence. So I gave her all three.

Scattered her from the old dock behind the house we never finished building. I watched her disappear into a tide that didn’t pull her back.

And then the lights began.

  
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The first few days were quiet. Too quiet. The kind of silence that builds a shape around you, presses in, waits for you to speak first. I didn’t.

But the house did.

The photos changed first. Little things. A shadow where there hadn’t been one. Grace’s face slightly turned. Her smile a touch too wide. I told myself it was memory playing tricks, or the grief.

Then I found her handwriting. Not on old letters. Not in her journals. On the walls. 

Pencil first. Then ink. Then red.

"The door is open."

I checked every door. Locked. Sealed.

Still, the lights flickered.

Still, the handwriting grew.

Still, the clock stopped every night at 3:12 a.m.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



I tried to record it. Set up cameras in every room. Left the lights on. Sat on the couch with a baseball bat across my knees and watched the monitors until the lines blurred.

Nothing happened. Until I rewound the tape. That’s when I saw her.

Just a frame. Maybe two. At the very edge of the living room. In the hallway mirror. Standing behind me, her head slightly tilted.

I blinked. The screen went black. The tape melted inside the player. The lights flickered. And Grace laughed. The laughter didn’t stop.

It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t cruel. It was soft, almost thoughtful. Like the kind of laugh you give when someone reminds you of an old memory you don’t know if you’re ready to feel again.

But it didn’t come from the tape. It came from upstairs.

I took the stairs slower than I should have. Every step felt like memory. Every step a sound she used to make. And at the top, the hallway looked different. Longer. The doors were all open now. Even the attic.

…*Even the attic.*

I hadn’t been up there in years. Not since Grace got sick. It used to be where we stored all our almosts. The crib we never built. The frames we never hung. The wedding box with the vows we wrote but never said.

But when I pulled the ladder down, I smelled salt. And something else. Burnt dust. Old film. Static before lightning.

I climbed.  The attic was no longer ours.

The walls had changed. Not wood anymore… screen. Flickering white, broken with black slashes like half-loaded tape. The floor pulsed faintly beneath my feet, like breath.

And in the center, a chair. Her chair. Rocking gently, creaking, though no one sat in it.

I wanted to speak. Say her name. Say something, anything. But my mouth stayed closed. Not by choice. By... something else.

A monitor hummed to life in the corner. No power source. Just light. And then, a tape slid out from underneath the chair. Blank label. Black shell. Still warm.

I picked it up. It was heavier than it should’ve been. Like it was holding something it didn’t want me to see.

Still, I brought it downstairs.

Still, I put it in the only player that worked.

Still, I pressed play.

But the screen stayed black.

No sound. No flicker. Just that deep, yawning kind of silence that feels older than the room it’s in. And then the player ejected the tape on its own. But something had changed.

My reflection on the dark TV glass leaned a second behind me. When I stood, it didn’t. When I moved to the hallway, it stayed seated.

And then, only then, did the hallway lights flicker. All of them, at once.

I looked down the length of the corridor and saw the front door already open. It hadn’t been open before. On the kitchen table, something new had appeared.

A photograph. It wasn’t one I remembered taking. Grace was in it. But so was I. Older. Standing just behind her with my hand on her shoulder. We were smiling. That’s when I heard her voice, faint and tired, from nowhere at all:

“Go now, before it starts again.”

I turned to run when I saw it.

A thick black smear led from the kitchen to the basement door, which now stood wide open.

I should’ve run. But I followed it down.

The basement was colder than I remembered. Wider, too.

The concrete walls were covered in pages. Not taped, not pinned, grown from the surface, like mold. Every one of them was filled with my handwriting.

And every page was a transcript. 

Of things I never wrote.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

“Day 74: Grace visited again. Her skin is almost fully translucent now. I think that’s how she sees through the walls.”

“Day 128: I found the reel. It wasn’t buried. It was planted. There’s a difference.”

“Day 201: I asked her to leave. She said, ‘You’re the one who stayed.’”

“Day 265: The lights only flicker when I lie.”

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



That’s when I saw it. At the base of the far wall, half-submerged in the concrete like it had grown there with the mold… an old VCR. Plugged into nothing. And inside, a tape was already playing. I didn’t rewind it. Didn’t press play.

The screen across the room flickered on.

And Grace’s voice, softer than I remembered, whispered through the speakers:

“Come finish the ending.”

I stood in front of the screen as the tape played. But it wasn’t just Grace’s voice anymore. There was something beneath it. A sound behind the sound. A low, pulsing rhythm; like breath, or footsteps pacing across floorboards that shouldn’t exist.

I turned down the volume. The noise didn’t stop. It was coming from beneath the house. I knelt, pressed my ear to the floor. There it was again. Moving. Waiting.

I followed it, not with reason, but with something deeper. Like remembering a room I’d once dreamed of.

At the back of the basement, a section of the wall looked… wet. Soft. I reached out. The bricks gave way like paper. And behind them, a staircase.

One I never built.

Descending into a dark that wasn’t empty.

Just patient.

The steps were uneven.

Some rotted. Some stone. Some just light, thick like syrup underfoot.

My phone didn’t work. The screen showed me a battery percentage that kept ticking upward.

101%.

102%.

110%.

By the time I reached the landing, the screen embedded in the far wall flickered once.

It simply said:

“you’re almost out of time.”

The room ahead wasn’t lit. It was flickering. Not the lights… reality. Like an old tape wearing out.

Grace stood at the center. No longer pale. No longer translucent. Alive. Or close enough.

She turned to face me, smiling like she’d never left.

“You kept the tape,” she said.

I nodded.

“That’s okay,” she whispered. “We kept a lot.”

She reached out to me. I didn’t move. Her hand stopped inches from mine. Not in hesitation. In restraint.

“You still think this is about you,” she said gently. “That’s why it hurts.”

The walls behind her began to change. They rippled, like heat over pavement, then peeled away into layers; rooms from our old apartments, our first house, her hospital room, my childhood bedroom. Each layered atop the last like cells in something learning how to grow.

She stepped backward into them.

And they swallowed her.

I followed.

The first room was our kitchen, exactly as we left it the day she got her diagnosis. The calendar still on March. A single banana on the counter turning brown.

She stood by the sink. And so did I. Two of me now. One ghost. One watching.

The ghost-me reached for her. She pulled away.

He said something I couldn’t hear. She didn’t answer.

Then the lights flickered—

—and we were in the next room.

This one was colder.

It was the hospice center, the one with the flickering light in the hallway we joked about, before we knew.

She was lying in the bed. I was holding her hand. This time, I remembered what I said:

“If you can’t stay, just haunt me.”

The real me, the now-me, started to cry.

Grace sat up in the bed. Not the dying one. The version from below. She looked right at me.

“I tried,” she said.

And then the walls fell in. I landed in water. Not deep, just enough to soak me. It was a flooded hallway. Familiar wallpaper peeled like wet skin from the walls. Picture frames floated past my knees. All of them held images that moved.

Grace at seventeen. Grace asleep on the couch. Grace laughing with someone whose face had no features.

The water rippled. She was there again. But not walking this time. Floating. Face-up. Eyes open. Speaking without breath.

“You never asked what it cost,” she said. “You just wanted me near.”

The ceiling trembled above us. Through the cracks, I could see stars. But they were wrong. They were moving. Not drifting; reaching.

I climbed toward the light. Every step took me through another version of the house. Some pristine. Some rotted. One was entirely burned. Ash fell like snow.

I stepped over a version of myself curled on the floor, whispering the same word over and over.

“Rewind.”

The walls were bleeding light now. Flickering. Stuttering. And at the end of it all, Grace again. But different. Larger somehow. Wider. Wearing every face she ever had. 

She held the final tape.

“I didn’t mean to become this,” she said, “I just wanted to stay.”

I didn’t take the tape. I didn’t move.

But the floor did. It slid me toward her like film through a reel. The closer I got, the more distorted she became. Glitches in her edges, flickers behind her eyes, her skin shifting between scenes I never remembered living.

“You said you wanted me to haunt you,” she said.

“And you did.”

“But I got stuck,” she whispered. “You mourned me so hard the door stayed open.”

I didn’t know what to say.

She handed me the tape anyway.

“Break it, and I go back.”

“Rewind—” she paused. “And we loop forever.”

My hands shook. The tape felt heavier than the others. Warmer, like it had a pulse. The room dimmed. Somewhere above us, the lightbulb at the top of the stairs flickered once. Twice.

And then I dropped the tape. It didn’t fall. It hovered. Hung in the air like a held breath. Grace closed her eyes.

“I was never meant to be this loud,” she said.

Then the room exploded into static. But not visual. Auditory.

Every word we ever said. Every fight. Every kiss. Every unfinished sentence. Layered and echoing and backwards.

And at the center…

A silence that screamed.

When the noise stopped, I was alone. Not in a room. In a reel.

Everything around me pulsed in frames. The walls ticked. My hands twitched a few seconds behind my thoughts. I could see the grain in the air.

And then I heard her laugh. Soft. Warped. A glitch in the filmstrip. I turned and saw her again.   


“My turn,” she said.

And then she pressed her hand to my chest. And the reel began to rewind.

I saw everything backward.

The funeral. The diagnosis. Our first date. Her laugh. Her scream. Her silence.

The day we met.

And then…

I was a child.

And Grace was beside me. She handed me a tape and whispered:

“Choose.”

I blinked.

And I was back.

  
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

In the real house.

Morning light. No sound. No Grace.

Just the final tape sitting on my lap, with a label written in marker:

It said:

**Rewind?**

I sat with the tape in my lap like something living. Like it might shiver or speak.

The house held its breath. 

Eventually, I slid it into the player. The screen stayed black. Then, Grace appeared. Lying in a hospital bed. Asleep. Peaceful. A soft beeping in the background.

I remembered this day.

There I was, sitting beside her. Holding her hand. Smiling through tears.

The camera panned out.

Behind the curtain, the machines whispered. A rhythm, steady. Fading. A breath drawn, but not returned. The hush of something being turned off.

The light from the window touched her face, and I remembered.

Not the words, but the way she looked at me, like someone already half-free.

The screen cut to black. But one final line appeared, written in white:

**You didn't lose her.** **You let her go.**

The tape stopped. The lights came on. And I was alone again.

Except for her voice, barely a breath:

**"Thank you."**
