Okay, so, I’ve been asked to post about what Spike told me. Good news! I finally got around to writing it, so here it is.

I’m on break right now, so I gotta get this down quickly. 30 minutes is enough, right?

Spike happened to tell me about what he saw the very same day I saw the gargoyles. Apparently, he’d experienced this before I started working at the ice cream shop, so it’s not a surprise that I didn’t know about it sooner.

I did my best to write down what he said. With all that out of the way, here’s how Spike discovered about the cult.

•

I think it was, what, 10 in the morning? Of course it was at that time, the shop doesn’t stay open for that long. I had taken to just kind of standing there and doing nothing for the first hour of my shift. We usually only get our customers around noon, so it was as good as dead in the morning.

 I thought it would be like a normal shift, but I couldn’t have been more incorrect. The bell rang, notifying me that someone had entered the shop. I was looking at the different ice cream flavors, so I had to move quickly if I wanted to get to the cash register in time to meet the customer.

As it turned out, I couldn’t need to worry about being cordial to them.

It was a man. He gave me strange vibes looking at him, like there was something REALLY wrong. If I concentrated, I could even here him muttering something under his breath. I couldn’t really tell what he looked like, but the small view of his face I got painted a man brown hair and some stubble. The reason I couldn’t see most of his face was due to the large white hood covering it. Not THAT kind of white hood. Unfortunately, the comparisons didn’t end there. He was wearing robes with the hood attached to them.

I couldn’t hear much of what he was saying, but a word I frequently heard coming up was *Morte*, whatever that meant. A few minutes passed and the situation remained the same. I decided to break the silence by asking him if he was okay.

“Hey, man,” I said. “You okay? Seem kinda—”

“What?” He asked. His voice was shaky and he sounded like he was in a hurry. “I’m okay! I’m just trying to figure out—how to—do you want to join us?”

That was sudden. I tilted my head. I wasn’t scared at this point. Intrigued, for sure, but not scared. I decided to humor the man rather than ridicule him.

“Join what?” I asked. “Like, a group?”

“Kind of,” He said. “We run a group in town. We’re kind of—religious, if you catch my drift.” So, it was one of THOSE situations.

I’d learned at this point not to be aggressive towards these people if it wasn’t warranted. So long as I was polite, but firm, I could get them out of the shop without much issue.

“S—sorry, man,” I said. “I think I’m gonna have to decline.”

“Oh, wait,” He replied. “Let me tell you more! We look up to this really cool guy. He’s kind of like—death.”

I cocked my head once more. Somehow, this guy had piqued my interest again.

“Okay,” I said. “Go on…”

“Ah, well,” He replied. “There isn’t really much to it other than that. Is it—enough to go off of?”

It was not enough to go off of.

“No thanks,” I finished. “I appreciate the offer, but I’m not really a religious guy.” Like most door-to-door religious folks, I expected him to be calm, cordial and accepting of my answer. I certainly wasn’t expecting what he said next.

“Oh well,” He said. “I suppose you’ll be one of the fallen, then.”

“What the hell?” I asked. “What does THAT mean?”

“You’ll find out,” He said. “It’s just a matter of time.”

Before I could say another thing to him, he whirled around and began to walk away… towards the bathroom.

“Sorry,” He said. “Just have to do one more thing before I leave!”

Listen, I don’t like dickhead customers, but even they deserve to be able to go to the bathroom. I will say, though, what this guy did in that bathroom was genuinely disgusting unacceptable.

He left and another customer walked in. The robed man even held the door open for him, the two-faced bastard.

The newest customer asked for a vanilla scoop with sprinkles on a waffle cone. While I was getting his cone together, he went to the bathroom. He wasn’t in there for very long. He came crashing out—from what I heard from behind the counter—and nearly slipped on his way back to me.

“D-d-dude,” He said, pointing towards the bathroom. “Y-you gotta check in there, man. What-what the hell?”

I gave him his cone and sent him on his way. “Have a good day,” I told him.

“I’ll try!” He said on the way out.

After he left, I came out from behind the counter and decided I’d investigate the bathroom. Just to see what shook him up so badly, you know? I certainly couldn’t have expected what I found in there.

The heat was the first indicator that something wasn’t right. It’s an ice cream shop; it’s going to be cold most of the time. Since I’d become accustomed to that cold, I was shocked to feel some heat coming from the cracks between the door and the frame.

Not really knowing what to do next, I grabbed the handle and yanked the door open.

In the middle of the bathroom, somehow, there was a sigil. I don’t mean it was burned into the wall or the floor, no. It was burned into the *air*. I questioned it, and then took a step forward. I felt my heart skip a beat and my vision went black for a second.

In that second, I saw something horrible. It was this pitch black, amorphous figure. It looked like the thing was eating people. No, eating wasn’t the right word, nothing went towards the thing’s “mouth.” Instead, it looked like it was moving what I thought to be hands around. When the hands moved, the people disappeared.

As quickly as it came, the vision went and I was back in the ice cream shop. Except, this time, the sigil was gone. I had two thoughts then.

“Who the hell am I gonna tell about this?”

And—

“Stupid religious people and their stupid religious magic.”

•

So, yeah, quite a bit weirder than what I saw. You might be thinking that walking gargoyles are much weirder to see than—than whatever Spike saw. And I’d agree with you, I would! But uh, the burned-into-the-air sigil is way weirder than all of that. And the visions Spike saw? Weird, man.

I just remembered another strange thing that happened here, actually. It was a couple days after my encounter with the Gargoyles. I don’t work on Sundays, but Lily does. Lily Walker. She’s essentially the third wheel on me and Spike’s tricycle. That’s to say she completes our little trifecta. She’s small, like, really small. She’s got a similar hair color to me, but lighter, and with better looking bangs. Spike has told me that whenever he looks into her eyes, he feels like they’re piercing his. Oh, and she’s British. But don’t fault her for that! She’s not like the rest of them.

Well, enough about her. Not to sound rude, but you probably want to read about what she saw. I was surprised by just how willing she was to tell me about it. Thinking back on it now, I’m not really all that surprised. I mean, when nothing happens at the shop, NOTHING HAPPENS. It is very boring.

Anyways, here’s what she told me.

•

I was about to leave the store, as my shift had just ended. I’d turned nearly everything off, put all the stuff that needed putting back, well, *back*. And I had just finished cleaning the floors when the damn power went out.

“Shop, you damned muppet.” I mumbled under my breath. I got up and decided that I’d try and find out what actually switched the breaker. Sitting around, wallowing, and calling the shop stupid wouldn’t turn the power back on. Or maybe it would. No, probably not.

I made my way outside and to the back. That’s where our breaker box is located, for some reason. What I found didn’t shock me all that much, to be honest. It’s what the muggy bastard turned into that shocked me.

Hanging on the switch of the open breaker box… was a kitty. A cute, not-at-all-dangerous little Calico. I sighed and put a hand on the building.

“Just what the hell’are ya doing, kitty?” I asked. “Go on, bugger off now, go! Get! Get!” I waved my hands in front of me, attempting to banish the cat from the premises. Instead of being smart and doing what I asked, the damn thing transformed!

I was shocked at first, but remember what Spike had told me the first day I worked here.

“You’re going to see some really weird things, Lily. Just uh, go with the flow, yeah? None of the are really all that harmful.”

Sure, this thing couldn’t physically harm me, but I sure as shit wasn’t feeling all that great upstairs. I would have been fine, had the thing not turned into a mangy rat right in front of me. It let go of the breaker switch and scurried away. Away isn’t the right word, actually. It rounded the corner sharply and went to what I assumed was the front of the building.

I didn’t hear it transform again, if it made any sound at all. I know it transformed because I heard the sound of tearing metal and could only assume that meant trouble from the little shapeshifter. I went the same way it did and sprinted back to the entrance of the store.

When I made it there, I fell on my ass and tried to back up. This thing had turned into a damn grizzly bear! And it was tearing our entrance door off the hinges! Oh, I was tamping alright. I got up and raised a fist in the air.

“HEY!” I yelled. “GET YOUR ARSE OUT OF HERE! YA’ DAMN BOULDER!”

It simply turned to me and huffed. Then, it turned back around, and in one smooth morning, ripped the door the rest of the way off its hinges. Before I could do anything else, it tossed the door aside and turned back into the rat.

“You son of a—” I growled, moving towards it. I don’t know what I was thinking; I wouldn’t be able to catch up to this little bugger even if I sprinted. In addition to that, I hadn’t the slightest clue of where it would go. It wouldn’t let me catch it. I knew that much, at least.

It ran away and I was left standing in the bare entryway of our store, studying the destroyed door.

“Hmm,” I said. “Think I’m gonna have to go ahead and ring Kent.”

\-*Kent is our manager, not sure if I told you guys yet—Ollie-*

I gave him a rang and he picked up relatively quickly.

“Lily?” He asked. “Wha—what’re you calling for?”

“I think a shapeshifting thing tore the door of its hinges,” I said. I looked at the door and corrected myself. “Sorry, no. I don’t THINK it happened. It DID happen. You need to get over here, now.”

“Oh god,” He said. “Okay, I’ll be right over.” He hung up the phone and I waited for him to come, bored as all hell.

When he finally showed up, he wasn’t alone. There was a group of individuals in the bed of his truck. Who they were, I had yet to know. But I’d find out soon.

Kent examined the door and looked up to the truck. “Yup. Come on!” He clapped his hands. Out of the truck came three goblins.

“Goblins?” I said.

“Yeah, goblins,” Kent said. “But not any goblins! These are the Carpenter Goblins!”

“Interesting,” I said. “Are they good at it?”

“That door should be opening and closing by—” He said, checking his watch. “Tomorrow.”

“Cool,” I said, looking over at my car. “Can I uh—you know?”

“Oh, yeah, sure,” Kent said. “Not like there’s much else going on here tonight.”

“You sure?” I asked.

“Go home,” he said. “I’ll hold things down here.”

“Okay. Good night, then,” I said.

“Night,” He replied.

After that, I got into my car and I went home. Nothing else really happened that night. I did go to bed with one thought, though.

“I sure do have something interesting to tell Spike and Ollie.”

That last part was something she included in the story herself. Or something she wanted to include. Guess it made the end sound cooler.

Damn, 30 minutes is just about up and there looks to be like 12 hungry Carpenter Goblins outside the store. I have got to go.

Don’t worry though, I’ve still got plenty more to write about. Just need plenty more 30-minute breaks, too. 

More to come, it’s just—those goblins are getting impatient and I really don’t want to see a pissed off Carpenter Goblin. Oh, and one more thing.

I think me and Spike discovered where the shapeshifter that Lily encountered went.

I just wish we could have done it in a less horrifying way, but, oh well.
