When I moved into my late grandmother's house, I thought I’d feel her absence everywhere. Instead, it was the opposite. The house felt alive with her presence, like she had never truly left. The air was thick, carrying the weight of countless memories. Every creak of the old doors and groan of the floorboards felt deliberate, like the house was breathing, sighing with her life.

She loved music. That record player I bought her, it wasn’t just a gift. It became a part of her, an extension of the joy she carried with her. She wasn’t tech-savvy, streaming services baffled her. But those vinyl records, they made her come alive. I still remember the way her eyes would light up as the music started, her fingers tapping along with the rhythm. She would laugh, tell me stories of her youth, and hum to every song like it was written just for her.

When she died, it didn’t make sense. She was healthy, no signs, no warnings. My mother found her first, sitting in her favorite chair. Her body was slumped forward, her hand resting on the armrest as if she’d simply dozed off. But her eyes... my mother said they were open, staring, lifeless. Fixed on something she couldn’t see. The record player beside her still spun silently, the needle lifted as though the music itself had stopped in respect.

When I moved in, I avoided her room for days. Something about it felt too sacred, too final. But eventually, I had to go in. Everything was exactly as she left it. The chair, the records, even the faint scent of her lavender perfume lingering in the air. I sat down in her chair, letting the worn fabric sink under me. My fingers traced the grooves in the armrests, imagining all the times she must have sat there, happy, alive.

The record player caught my eye. The disc resting on the turntable read *The Best of Rockabilly Collection*. It was one of her favorites. I placed it on the turntable, hesitating for just a moment before lowering the needle.

The music began, and for a while, it was comforting. The familiar strumming of the guitar filled the room, its rhythm matching the heartbeat of the house. I closed my eyes, letting the memories wash over me. But then, something shifted.

A faint sound, like a whisper, began to creep into the music. I opened my eyes, my heart quickening. It was so faint I thought I’d imagined it, but then it came again.

“Ji.”

The voice was soft, barely louder than the static from the record. My chest tightened as the word echoed in my mind. That was her name for me, her special nickname, something no one else ever called me. My rational mind told me it was just a trick of the static, but my body disagreed. My hands trembled, my breath coming in shallow bursts as I strained to listen.

“Ji,” the voice said again, louder this time.

The air in the room grew heavier, pressing down on me like a physical weight. I couldn’t look away from the record player. My chest burned as I held my breath, afraid that even the slightest movement would shatter the moment.

“Drawer,” the voice said, sharp and commanding now. “Check the drawer.”

The words hit me like a cold wind, slicing through the haze of disbelief. My hands clutched the chair’s armrests so tightly that my knuckles ached, but I couldn’t let go. My entire body felt locked, every muscle tense and unwilling to move.

The music continued, unfazed, but I couldn’t hear it anymore. All I could hear was her voice, echoing in my head. Slowly, I forced myself to stand, my legs shaky and weak beneath me. Every step toward the drawer felt like I was wading through water, my movements sluggish and heavy.

When I reached the drawer, my hands hovered over the handle, trembling so violently that I could hear the faint rattle of my fingers against the wood. My mind screamed at me to stop, to leave, to run, but my hands disobeyed. I pulled the drawer open.

Inside was a record. The label, written in her unmistakable handwriting, read: *To my dearest Ji*.

I stared at it, my vision blurring as tears welled in my eyes. My hands shook as I lifted the record, its surface cool and smooth under my fingertips. She’d never mentioned this to me, never told me it existed. Why?

My body felt like it was moving on its own as I placed the record on the turntable. My breath hitched as the needle lowered, the crackling static filling the room like a storm on the horizon.

Then her voice came through.

“Ji, I’m still here,” she said. Her tone was distant, strained, like she was speaking from somewhere far away. “Take me out, Ji. Please... end my misery.”

Her words grew frantic, trembling with fear and desperation. The static swelled, drowning out the music. My chest heaved, my lungs struggling for air as the sound built and built, growing louder with each passing second. My legs felt like jelly, barely holding me upright.

Then the scratching sound started. It wasn’t coming from the record player anymore. It was behind me.

I wanted to run. My brain screamed at me to move, but my body refused. My heart pounded so violently I could feel it in my throat. Slowly, against my will, I turned.

She was there. Sitting in her chair, pale and unmoving. Her eyes were white and empty, staring into nothingness. Her mouth hung open, and from it spilled a ribbon of magnetic tape, unspooling endlessly onto the floor.

The sight struck me like a lightning bolt. My legs buckled, and I collapsed to the floor, unable to look away. My breath came in shallow, ragged gasps, my chest heaving as panic seized every part of me.

The scratching sound grew louder, filling the room until it was all I could hear. I closed my eyes, squeezing them shut as tears streamed down my face.

When the sound finally stopped, I opened my eyes.

I wasn’t in her house anymore. I was in a hospital room. She lay in a bed, her frail body hooked up to machines. A nurse adjusted her feeding tube, oblivious to the chaos that had just consumed me.

In my hand was a note.

“To my dearest Ji,” it read. “I have so many great memories with you. And the day you got me the record player is easily the best one.”
