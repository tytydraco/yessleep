Up until this a few years ago, I hadn’t had any problems with roommates or neighbors since I moved away from the big city. The whole reason why I did it was to get away from all the noise. Years of footsteps thumping above my head, music blaring from another apartment, yelling in some dingy alley - I could hear just about anything, loud and clear, through the paper-thin walls of my old place. When I finally graduated college and found a remote job, I could go somewhere where I could get some much-needed peace and quiet. Part of me wanted to wait until I saved up enough for a mortgage, but I was so sick of the crap by that point that I was willing to take what I could get.

After searching for listings, I found a spare bedroom in a small town about an hour away. A drive-through town with nothing of note, really, but I wasn’t really looking for much action. Just a place I could stay in for about a year until I saved up some money. I’d be living in a one-story flat alongside a couple, which was immediately a bit weird to me - why would they wanna live with some single dude in his late 20s? I shrugged it off, since the rent was cheap and I didn’t wanna be judgmental of someone else’s financial situation. Looks like I’d just have to get used to third-wheeling a lot.

After talking to the couple over the phone, they agreed to grab lunch with me at some diner at the edge of town to discuss the possibility of me renting the room. They seemed relatively normal. John worked in IT, and it showed - bags under his blue eyes, a constant air of slight nervousness even though it was a Saturday. He was nice enough, though, and since I’m also in the tech industry, we talked about video games for a bit while his wife was in the bathroom. Monica was an odd duck, for sure - she was gorgeous, but quiet. She had a beautiful head of long red hair, and stunning green eyes. As compared to John’s more laid-back demeanor, she was high-strung, her eyes darting across the diner, reacting to every possible noise. Hell, if her boyfriend wasn’t so low-energy, I’d think she was on something, and I’m still not sure she’s not, but I brushed it off. After all, I couldn’t exactly read her well - she barely spoke five words the entire time I was there, aside from the occasional affirmation of what John was saying. I just chalked it up to her being shy, and figured that if I ended up living with them, we could be friendly.

They gave me a rundown of how they ran their household, and it was pretty standard - no loud noise after 10pm, no dishes left in the sink, clean the bathroom on a rotating schedule. I don’t like a messy space, either, so that wasn’t a problem. There were some strange requests from them, though. The first was that I couldn’t turn any lights on after 10pm, apart from my room’s. John said it was because he got migraines easily from artificial light, and we agreed to a small night light in the main hallway so that I could find the bathroom at night. The weirdest request, though, was the fact that the basement was off-limits. They said it was because of mold that the landlord kept delaying a fix for, and they alleviated it spreading to the rest of the house with some spray they put on the basement stairs. They insisted that I don’t go down there until it’s fixed, and that I could store my excess stuff in the hall closet. To be honest, I didn’t have much that couldn’t fit in the room, so I didn’t have a problem with that, and bought the story.

I agreed to their rules, gave them the first month’s rent up front, and we were all set. The first week living there went pretty smoothly; I spent most of it moving stuff into my room and doing training for my new job. I ate dinner with John and Monica on the second night, and I thought it went well. John and I talked about our self-care routines, as people in our field have the reputation for being shut-ins with bad hygiene and we both seemed to be outliers. The conversation mostly consisted of me giving him tips on my favorite hair styling products, and him giving me skincare tips. He stressed the importance of good skincare to me - he said that there’s no better feeling than having new skin. He quickly clarified that he meant freshly exfoliated skin, and I chucked at his verbal misstep. I thought that was a bit of a weird way to describe it, but I agreed with the general sentiment. Monica seemed to be opening up to me, speaking to me about twice as much as she did before. That was still only about ten words total, but progress is progress. She seemed like a nice woman with a staring problem - every time I’d glance over at her, she’d be looking right at me, with her eyes wide open and her face blank. She’d always quickly look away, though, and I was mid-conversation, so I didn’t really think anything of it at the time.

It was on the eighth night of staying there that I heard it for the first time. It was very brief, and just loud enough that I could barely hear it over the fan on my nightstand - this little croaking-type noise. It sounded like it was either somewhere in my room or directly outside of it. Admittedly, it did freak me out a bit, and I hopped up and shut the fan off to try and hear it better. As soon as the fan was off, though, the room stayed silent. I assumed that it was just ‘old-house noises’ and turned the fan back on so that I could go to bed. In hindsight, I probably shouldn’t have just gone back to bed without a little investigation, but after I calmed down, I kind of just defaulted to the most rational explanation. After all, I had a Zoom call in the morning.

The next day, I was walking by the basement door when it hit me - there was this awful smell coming from behind it. I didn’t wanna break the rules less than two weeks into living here, so I went into the kitchen where John was making lunch and told him about it. He didn’t seem fazed by it - he told me it was probably just an animal that found its way into the basement and died and assured me he’d go and check when he finished eating. To his credit, he did just that, and came back up affirming that it was a dead raccoon. I didn’t stick around to see him drag it out of the basement - I had work to do, so I left him to it.

I heard another noise that night. It was different from the one I’d heard yesterday, but it was equally as disturbing. It was this panting noise, like a dog would do after sprinting across the yard to fetch a ball. I turned the fan off, and like it did before, the noise immediately stopped. To put it politely, I was losing my shit at this point, and stayed up the rest of the night getting work done. I wasn’t sure if there was some animal in the house, or what, but what I heard didn’t come from the house. It couldn’t have.

I sat down at the dinner table the next night, since John and I had planned to grill that night, and immediately asked John if he was outside my room last night. I probably should’ve waited a bit before asking that, since he kind of just stared at me with this blank look that didn’t have any emotion in it. His face quickly morphed into a confused expression, though, and he assured me that he had slept through the night and didn’t come near my space. I was a bit skeptical, since I didn’t know what kind of animal could be making those kinds of noises, but I disregarded it at that moment to ask if Monica was joining us. He shook his head with a slight grin on his face, and said that she was away on business. Thinking about it, I hadn’t seen her since I had dinner with them a week ago, so I joked about her taking a vacation on the company’s dime. He laughed, and said she was in Vegas, in the sweltering heat. That sounded like literal hell to me, but hey, maybe she’d win big and rent would go down. Or they’d just kick me out, one of the two.

I had a few nights of peaceful sleep before it happened again. Again, it was a different sound - a mix of two, in fact. A scraping noise that seemed to be coming from the door, and what sounded like someone whispering. I quietly got out of bed and, without turning the fan off, crept over to the door and put my ear against it. I couldn’t tell if it was a man or woman’s voice, but it was right there. They were speaking in gibberish - a mix of English words and garbled nonsense. One phrase stood out to me, that was said a couple of times, although it didn’t seem to mean anything - “nooskin”.

At that moment, I tried to get onto my knees and peer under the crack in the door, but the floorboard creaked under my weight - I’m honestly surprised they didn’t sooner, but this was the worst possible moment for it. The scraping and whispering immediately stopped, and after a moment of silence, a new noise filled the empty air - what sounded like muffled crying. The sound of rapid footsteps echoed down the hallway and stopped just as suddenly as it started. I was freaked the fuck out, and knew I couldn’t stay another night in this place without figuring out what was going on. I was too chickenshit to open the door and peek into the hallway to see if I could see anything, so I did the next best thing - I cracked the door open and slid my phone out of the crack, with the camera facing into the hallway. I sat against the door, blocking it with my weight for about three minutes, and as I yanked my phone back into the room, I heard a few more footsteps further down the hall. I wasn’t sleeping that night, and immediately started throwing my shit into the moving boxes that lay folded against my wall. I didn’t check the footage that night. I couldn’t bring myself to.

Four hours or so later, the sun was rising, and I felt safe to crack the door open and peek out. The hallway was empty, but I noticed that the night light I’d stuck into the outlet was gone. I didn’t question it - I grabbed my keys off of the hanger in the hallway and got out of there. I drove for about ten miles before pulling into the parking lot of some restaurant, and finally taking a deep breath. I still didn’t wanna look at the video.

I returned to the house later that day, intent on grabbing my stuff and leaving. I didn’t sign any lease, so I didn’t need to tell them anything - I could just leave and never talk to either of them ever again. I still wasn’t convinced it was John pranking me, but I didn’t have any other explanation for anything I heard. The house was empty, or at least I thought it was - it’s not like I was gonna call out for John to see if he was home. He should’ve been at work, anyway. What was odd, though, was that his and Monica’s bedroom door was open - I’d never seen the interior of their room before, and I sure as hell wasn’t about to start now. On my last trip into the house to grab the last of my stuff, I was walking back into the hallway, relieved to be finally done.

And then it happened.

Quicker than I could process, the basement door at the end of the hallway flew open, and a high-pitched shriek echoed through the house. It sounded like the weeping I had heard the other night, only mutated into a full-blown wailing. I dropped my box and froze, unable to comprehend what was happening. The shriek abruptly stopped, and there was silence. Slowly, something poked its head above the top step of the basement stairs, as if it was lying down on the steps. I saw Monica - her hair, her face, her eyes, looking at me with a grin plastered across her face. Her skin was wrinkled, and her eyes looked like they were sunken into her head. She didn’t speak as I stood there, completely paralyzed. She just looked at me.

She suddenly shrieked again, as her bottom lip drooped down to reveal her gums. Not wanting to run down the hallway towards her, I ducked into the couple’s room, since mine didn’t have a window I could use to get out of there. I shut the door behind me as loud footsteps quickly encroached on my location, and immediately, there was pounding and screaming on the outside of the bedroom door. I tipped the cabinet over to try and block the door, and immediately started pulling on the window, trying to open it. The banging on the door was starting to turn into smashing. I finally got the window open, and without looking back, I jumped out and booked it to my car.

I drove until I had to fill up my tank, and then drove some more. I tried not to think about what had just happened, but I couldn’t help it. I thought about what would have happened if I couldn’t get the window open. Then I thought about the bedroom. It was a weird layout. There was a twin bed, instead of a bigger size, and no women’s accessories or clothes in sight. Eventually, I pulled over and stayed at a motel for the night, and before I went to bed, I pulled out my phone and deleted the video I had taken. I had been putting off watching it, and I didn’t wanna see it.

This whole thing happened two years ago. I would’ve been content with never telling anyone about this, as I didn’t wanna have to picture that thing in my head again, but something happened that made me wanna write it down. The other day, I was searching through my iCloud to send pictures of my childhood home to my Tinder match, since we apparently grew up in the same town and I wanted to prove it, when I saw it. The video I had deleted that night. It had apparently uploaded itself to iCloud, as things do when you have that enabled.

I made a stupid decision. I decided to watch it. The video was dark, obviously - it was in a hallway at 2 am. The only thing providing any semblance of visibility was the night light I had set up. About ⅓ of the way through the video, something moved into the light. It was the thing, but this time, I could see it in its entirety. It was wrinkly, and way taller than Monica was. It moved closer to the camera, walking shakily on two legs. It got down onto its knees, and its repulsive face stared right into the camera, grinning. Its eyes were indeed sunken, as I’d noticed back then. Since it was so close, though, I could see new details about it that I couldn’t have possibly seen before. For one, Monica didn’t have blue eyes, like this thing did. Secondly, I’m pretty sure she didn’t have a second set of lips under hers.
