I didn't wake up; I simply became aware. Awareness arrived not as a thought, but as a sensation of immense, crushing weight. My feet felt as though they had been pouring into the pavement. The rubber of my sneakers fused with the sunbaked tar of a road that stretched into an infinite, hazy grey horizon. 

I was standing in line. 

I looked at my hands. They were pale, trembling, and slick with a thin film of yellow fluid that smelled faintly of copper and old milk. I don't remember walking here. I didn't remember the clothes I was wearing—a tattered grey tracksuit that felt uncomfortably damp against my skin. I tried to remember where I was before the grey, but the memories were like wet paper, tearing as soon as I tried to grasp them. 

Ahead of me stood a woman. Or, at least, she had been a woman once. Her back was a jagged landscape of protruding bone; her spine having burst through the fabric of her shirt like a row of ivory shark teeth. She didn't move. She didn't breathe. Every few minutes, a wet, sucking sound would emanate from her heels as they sank deeper into the asphalt. 

I turned to look behind me, hoping for a gap, a way out. But the line was a solid wall of meat. The man behind me was so close I could feel the heat radiating from his chest. His face was a tragedy of biology; his eyes had migrated down to his jawline, and his mouth was a vertical slit that hummed with the sound of a thousand trapped flies. 

"Don't leave your space," he vibrated. The sound didn't come from his mouth, but from the pores of his skin. "The position is sacred. The position is the only thing you own." 

I tried to lift my foot. A scream tore through my throat as the skin of my sole remained attached to the ground, stretching like hot mozzarella. I stayed. I waited. I belonged to the line. I didn't know where we were going, but the air was getting warmer, and the smell of roasting salt began to rise from the cracks in the road. 

By the time the sun—a sickly, bruised purple orb—reached its zenith, the hunger began. It wasn't a normal stomach cramp. It was a violent, predatory gnawing in my marrow. My body felt as though it were turning inward, trying to consume its own organs to justify its existence in this endless queue. 

I watched the woman ahead of me. Her jagged spine began to pulse. A small, fleshy aperture opened at the base of her neck, and a long, translucent tube unspooled from her throat. It didn't reach for food. It reached for the person in front of her. It was a parasitic necessity; in this place, the only way to stay "correct" was to steal the substance of the next data point in the sequence. 

The tube latched onto the shoulder of the man ahead of her, burrowing through his shirt with the efficiency of a drill. I watched, gagging, as a thick, grey slurry began to pump through the tube, moving from his body into hers. He didn't even flinch. He simply stared ahead, his eyes milky and vacant. He was being hollowed out to keep her standing. 

Suddenly, I felt a sharp, wet pressure against my own calf. I looked down. A small, pink tentacle—tapered like a finger but wet like an organ—had sprouted from the man behind me and was currently sewing itself into my muscle. 

I tried to kick it away, but my legs were becoming rigid, the muscle fibers turning into something resembling wet cardboard. As the tentacle pulsed, I felt my memories being drained. I saw a flash of a woman’s face—Mira? No, that name felt like an error—and then watched the image dissolve into a grey sludge that flowed down into the man behind me. He wasn't just eating my calories; he was eating my history. 

I reached forward, my own hunger overriding my horror. My fingers felt elongated, the nails sharpening into hooks. My jaw unhinged with a sound like wet timber snapping. I didn't want to do it, but my body moved with a terrifying autonomy. I reached for the woman’s protruding spine. I needed to be filled. If I didn't feed on the one ahead, I would be erased by the one behind. 

The line moved forward not in steps, but in a collective, rhythmic shudder. Every time the "Front" processed a soul, the entire mile-long chain of human wreckage lurched six inches forward. The sound of thousands of feet peeling off the tar simultaneously was like a giant wet tongue slapping against a cold floor. 

As we moved, the people around me began to undergo the "Optimization." To my left, a man’s arms had begun to migrate, the shoulder sockets sliding down his ribcage until his hands dangled near his knees. His fingers grew together, forming a singular, spade-like limb. He wasn't a person anymore; he was a tool for digging, though there was nothing but asphalt to claw at. 

"The Gate is beautiful," he whispered, his voice bubbling through a throat filled with fluid. "The Gate is where the weight stops." 

I looked at my own chest. The tracksuit was splitting. My ribs were beginning to grow outward, curving and sharpening until they resembled the legs of a crab. They twitched in the stagnant air, sensing the vibrations of the line. I realized then that we weren't just waiting for something. We were being prepared. Like cattle being softened before the slaughter, our bodies were being reshaped to fit the architecture of the place we were going. 

The horizon was no longer grey. It was turning a deep, throbbing crimson. The heat was no longer coming from the sun; it was coming from the ground beneath us. The tar was turning into a viscous, boiling soup of oil and blood. 

The woman with the spine turned her head to look at me. Her eyes were gone, replaced by two weeping sores that leaked a thick, black bile. "Do you hear the singing?" she asked. 

I listened. Beyond the sound of wet skin and snapping bone, there was a sound. It wasn't singing. It was the sound of a billion voices screaming at exactly the same pitch, so perfectly synchronized that it sounded like a single, beautiful, terrifying note. 

We were close. The Correction was about to become eternal. 

The sky did not darken; it bruised. The deep purple of the zenith began to leak a thick, black ichor that hung in the air like frozen smoke. As the crimson glow from the front of the line intensified, a new sound emerged—not the collective humming of the damned, but the rhythmic, metallic snip-snap of giant blades. 

The Gatekeepers had arrived. 

They were tall, spindly things that looked as though they had been constructed from rusted surgical tools and discarded ribs. They moved along the edges of the line with a twitchy, insectoid grace. Their faces were smooth, featureless plates of polished brass, reflecting our own distorted agony back at us. 

The man with the migrated arms—the one who had become a digging tool—was the first to be "pruned." One of the Gatekeepers leaned over him, its multiple jointed limbs clicking. It didn't use words. It used a long, hooked blade to snag the man’s spade-like hands. With a wet, fibrous tear, it sheared the excess limbs from his torso. The man didn't scream; he let out a long, airy whistle as the green bile from his sac sprayed across the asphalt. 

"Productivity check," the man behind me vibrated, his mouth-slit foaming with grey saliva. "The Gate only accepts the essential. Anything that does not fit the final mold must be harvested." 

I looked at my own chest. My crab-like ribs were twitching violently now, sensing the cold brass of the Gatekeepers. I tried to pull them inward, to hide the mutation, but the bone was rigid and stubborn. When the Gatekeeper reached me, the reflection in its brass face showed me a monster—a thing with too many jagged edges and eyes that were beginning to weep a thick, yellow pus. 

The creature’s blade hovered over my chest. I felt the cold steel bite into the skin over my sternum. But instead of cutting, the Gatekeeper paused. It tilted its head, the brass plate vibrating. It sensed the "Correction" from your previous world—the lingering ghost of Mira’s erasure. 

"Incomplete data," it hissed, the sound like steam escaping a pipe. "A fragment remains. The weight is unbalanced." 

It didn't harvest my ribs. Instead, it reached into the open wound in my chest and pulled. It wasn't pulling bone; it was pulling a memory. I saw a flash of a blue dress, a silver locket, the smell of rain—and then it was gone, snapped away by the creature’s hook. I fell forward, my face hitting the boiling tar, as the line lurched another six inches toward the red. 

By the fifth day, the road began to tilt. We were no longer walking on a flat plane; we were descending into a throat. The asphalt was becoming soft, turning into a substance that felt like wet, sun-rotted velvet. Every step required a Herculean effort to keep from sinking entirely into the ground. 

The woman ahead of me had lost her ivory spine. In its place, her entire back had opened into a single, massive mouth that sucked in the hot, sulfurous air. She was no longer a person; she was a lung, a bellows for the fires we were approaching. 

"I remember the sun," a voice croaked from somewhere to my right. I turned, but there was no person there—only a pile of twitching, translucent organs held together by a thin lattice of veins. "It was yellow. It didn't burn the soul; it only warmed the skin." 

"Heresy," the man behind me hissed. He had grown larger, his body absorbing the asphalt beneath him. He was becoming a mound of tar and teeth, his vertical mouth now wide enough to swallow a child. "There is no sun. There is only the Front. There is only the processing." 

I tried to look at my feet, but they were gone. My legs had fused into a single, muscular trunk that undulated to move me forward. The body horror was no longer an external mutation; it was a total systemic failure. My internal organs were shifting, my stomach rising into my throat, my heart migrating to my lower back where it thudded against the boiling mud of the road. 

I realized then that we were being broken down into a base fluid. We were the oil for the machinery of Hell. The "Correction" wasn't a mistake—it was the refinement process. They were skimming the humanity off the top so that only the raw, suffering energy remained. 

Ahead, the red horizon split open. It wasn't a sunset. It was a pair of lips, miles wide, beginning to pull back to reveal teeth made of jagged obsidian and rusted iron. 

The sound was unbearable now. The "singing" I had heard before was revealed to be the grinding of the Gate's teeth. Each tooth was the size of a skyscraper, and between the cracks, I could see the millions of souls who had arrived before us. They weren't being eaten; they were being used as grout. Their flattened, screaming bodies were packed into the crevices of the Gate to keep the structure airtight. 

The heat was absolute. My skin began to blister, but the blisters didn't pop—they grew eyes. Dozens of them, blinking rapidly, staring at the horror of the Gate. I had a hundred different points of view, a hundred ways to see my own damnation. 

The woman ahead of me reached the threshold. She didn't walk through; she was inhaled. A massive, hot draft of air sucked her upward. I watched as her body stretched like taffy, her ivory spine snapping into a thousand pieces that sparkled like stars before being swallowed by the obsidian dark. 

"Next," the man behind me vibrated. He pushed his tar-filled mass against my back, his vertical mouth opening so wide I could see the swirling void inside him. 

I reached out, my fingers now long, hooked talons, and grabbed the edge of the Gate. The obsidian was cold—colder than the void. It burned with a freezing fire. I looked back one last time at the mile-long line of meat and misery. They were all smiling now. Their distorted, mutilated faces were twisted into expressions of ecstatic relief. 

They wanted the end. They wanted to be grout. 

"Who are you?" I screamed into the dark of the Gate, hoping for a god, a demon, even a machine. 

The answer didn't come in words. It came as a feeling of absolute, mathematical certainty. 

You are the correction, the dark whispered. You are the error that must be filed away. 

Passing through the Gate was not an entrance into a room, but a fall into a digestive tract. The obsidian teeth didn't crush me; they acted as a filter, stripping away the last remnants of my clothing and the outer layer of my skin until I was nothing but raw, red muscle and screaming nerves. I tumbled down a long, curved chute made of calcified tongues, the surface wet and tasting of copper and bile. 

I landed in a chamber that defied the laws of gravity and geometry. The walls were made of billions of tiny, obsidian drawers, each one vibrating with a muffled, rhythmic thumping. In the center of the room sat the Archivist. 

He was a mountain of grey, translucent flesh, his body resembling a massive, water-logged brain. Instead of eyes, his surface was covered in thousands of human mouths, all of them whispering different names at once. He held a pen made from a sharpened femur, and he was writing directly onto the skin of a man who had been flattened into a living sheet of parchment. 

"Wait," I croaked, my voice sounding like wet leather tearing. "I’m not… I shouldn’t be here. There was a mistake. A correction." 

The Archivist didn't stop writing. A mouth near his "shoulder" opened and spoke. "There are no mistakes in the queue. There is only the inventory. You are a data point with a persistent error—a ghost-memory of a girl named Mira. We are simply deleting the 'attachment' before you are filed." 

He reached out with a hand that had thirty-four fingers and pressed a thumb into my forehead. I felt my skull soften like wax. He wasn't looking for my thoughts; he was looking for the "root" of my soul. He dug deep, his fingers bypasssing my brain and wrapping around the very core of my being. 

"Aha," the Archivist whispered through a hundred mouths simultaneously. "A stubborn thread. You held onto the love longer than the others. That makes you… high-calorie waste." 

He pulled. I felt a sensation of being unspooled. Every memory of Mira—her laugh, her scent, the way she looked in the sunlight—was being physically yanked out of my chest like a parasitic worm. As the thread came out, it was black and oily, dripping with the weight of my grief. The Archivist slurped it up, and for a moment, his grey flesh turned a healthy, nauseating pink. 

Once the "Mira-thread" was consumed, I felt a hollow lightness that was far more terrifying than the pain. I was no longer a person who had lost someone; I was a person who had never existed at all. I was a blank file, ready for formatting. 

The Archivist tossed me into the "Compression Chamber." It was a room where the floor and ceiling were two massive, rusted iron plates that moved toward each other with a slow, agonizing grind. There were dozens of us in there—the remnants of the line. 

We were being pressed together. The man with the vertical mouth was pushed against my side, his tar-like body merging with my ribcage. The woman with the ivory spine was above me, her crushed bones becoming a lattice that reinforced the structure of our new, collective form. 

"We are the bricks," the tar-man gurgled as his eyes fused with my shoulder. "We are the foundation of the House of Woes. One on top of another. Forever." 

The pressure became absolute. I felt my bones snap and flatten. My lungs were crushed into thin ribbons of tissue. My consciousness began to fragment, splitting into a thousand pieces as I was pressed into a square, uniform block of meat. I was no longer a "guy in a line." I was a "Unit of Suffering, Grade B." 

As the plates met, the last thing I saw was the Archivist's many mouths smiling. We weren't being destroyed; we were being repurposed. In Hell, nothing is wasted. Even the memory of a sister is just a seasoning for the Archivist’s meal. 

I thought the compression would be the end. I thought I would finally become a mindless brick in the wall of some infernal city. But then, the plates retracted. 

I wasn't a brick. I was a liquid. 

The pressure had been so great that we had all liquefied into a thick, black oil—the same oil that I had seen bubbling beneath the asphalt of the road. We were poured into a massive, rusted pipe that smelled of old blood and ancient sulfur. 

I felt myself flowing, my consciousness a thin, shimmering film on the surface of the sludge. We were pumped upward, through miles of calcified stone and pulsing veins, until suddenly, the pressure vanished. 

I was spat out onto a hard, grey surface. 

I felt the heat of a bruised purple sun. I felt the weight of my feet being poured into the tar. I looked at my hands—they were pale, trembling, and slick with a thin film of yellow fluid. 

I didn't wake up; I simply became aware. 

Ahead of me stood a woman with a jagged landscape of protruding bone on her back. Behind me, a man with a vertical mouth began to hum with the sound of a thousand trapped flies. 

"Don't leave your space," the man behind me vibrated. "The position is sacred." 

I looked down at the asphalt. There, etched into the tar in a handwriting that looked suspiciously like my own, were the words: RUN. IT NEVER ENDS. 

But I couldn't run. My feet were fused. The hunger was starting again. And in the distance, I could hear the grinding of the obsidian teeth, waiting to eat the memories I didn't even know I had regained. 

The realization that I was in a loop didn’t come as a shock; it came as a heavy, oily resignation. As I stood for the thousandth "first" time behind the woman with the ivory spine, the sky above the queue finally began to peel. 

It wasn't a sky at all. It was a ceiling of stretched, translucent skin, and behind it, I saw them. 

They were not demons with pitchforks. They were giants in white, clinical smocks, their faces hidden behind masks made of human fingernails stitched together. These were the Architects of the Correction. They stood on glass catwalks far above our suffering, holding long, slender needles that dipped down into the line like straws into a soda. 

I watched as one of the Architects leaned over. Its needle pierced the man behind me—the one who was now a mound of tar and teeth—and drew out a glowing, golden liquid. This was the "Essence of Agony," the only fuel powerful enough to keep their perfect, clean world running above us. 

"The yield is low on this batch," a voice boomed from the heavens, sounding like the grinding of a tectonic plate. "The subjects are losing their flavor. They’re becoming too accustomed to the revolting nature of the processing. We need more 'Fresh Correction'." 

The Architect looked directly at me. Its fingernail mask shifted as it smiled. "This one," it whispered, "still has a flicker of the 'Mira' ghost. It hasn't been fully erased. It’s a delicacy." 

Suddenly, the ground beneath the line opened up. But we didn't fall into the throat of the Gate this time. We were hoisted upward by invisible hooks. I saw the woman with the ivory spine being pulled apart, her vertebrae being used to decorate the banisters of a grand staircase in a world I could only dream of. I saw the man with the vertical mouth being squeezed like a sponge until his black oil coated the gears of a massive, golden clock. 

I was brought face-to-face with the Architect. It reached out a gloved hand and gently stroked my cheek, which was now a mass of weeping sores and blinking eyes. 

"You think this is Hell," the Architect said, its voice almost tender. "But Hell is a place of justice. This is just a factory. You aren't being punished, Daniel. You are being used. You are the grease that allows the 'Correct' world to stay silent. Without your scream, the quiet people above would have to hear the truth." 

It leaned in closer, the smell of formaldehyde and jasmine filling my lungs. "And the best part? Every time we loop you, we give you just enough hope to make the next harvest even sweeter. You’ll see Mira again. On the next trip through the line. She’ll be the one holding the Gate open for you." 

The Architect pushed me. I fell. 

I fell through the clouds of fingernails, through the skin-ceiling, and back down onto the sun-baked asphalt. 

I didn't wake up; I simply became aware. 

My feet were fused to the ground. The woman in front of me had a spine like shark teeth. But this time, when I looked at my hands, I saw a small, silver locket clutched in my palm. 

Hope. 

The cruelest body horror of all. My heart—now located in my lower back—gave a frantic, wet thud of joy. 

"Next," the man behind me vibrated. 

I smiled. The harvest was going to be magnificent.
