 I didn’t think much of it at the time.

That’s what keeps me awake now—how easily I brushed it off.

My friend Daniel and I went to the same high school. A public school in the suburbs. The kind of place where nothing ever really happened, and everyone pretended that was a good thing.

Daniel was normal. Quiet, maybe a little intense, but normal. Good grades. No disciplinary issues. The kind of student teachers trusted to hand out papers.

So when he told me he’d joined an after-school club, I barely looked up from my phone.

“What kind of club?” I asked.

He hesitated. Just for a second.

“Psychopathy Research.”

I laughed. I actually laughed.

“That’s not a real thing.”

“It is,” he said. “It’s school-approved.”

Looking back, that should’ve been the first warning.

The club didn’t appear on the official list alongside Chess Club or Debate. There were no flyers. No announcements. No online sign-ups.

You had to be invited.

Daniel said their advisor was a guidance counselor named Mr. Halvorsen. Older. Soft-spoken. Always smiling—but somehow, the smile never reached his eyes.

They met every Thursday after school in one of the unused portable classrooms behind the gym. The kind that still smelled faintly of dust and mold.

“What do you even do there?” I asked.

He shrugged. “Research. Case studies. Discussions.”

“Like serial killers?”

“No,” he said quickly. “That’s the first thing they told us. This isn’t about murder.”

That sentence stayed with me.

*This isn’t about murder.*

Over the next few weeks, Daniel changed.

Not in any dramatic way. He didn’t become violent or creepy.  
Just… subtle.

He stopped reacting to jokes the same way. He stared at people a little too long, like he was waiting for something to happen.

One day at lunch, a student at the next table started choking. Everyone panicked. Someone screamed for a teacher.

Daniel didn’t move.

He just watched.

Later, when I brought it up, he looked at me like I’d asked a strange question.

“I was observing,” he said. “That’s all.”

Eventually, curiosity got the better of me.

“Can I come to one of your meetings?” I asked.

Daniel shook his head immediately.

“No.”

The speed of his answer caught me off guard.

“Why not?”

“They don’t allow non-members,” he said. Then, after a pause, “And they don’t like it when members talk about the club.”

That should’ve been the second warning.

About a month later, Daniel stopped coming to school for three days.

No texts. No replies. When he finally came back, he looked exhausted. Pale. Like he hadn’t slept at all.

“What happened?” I asked between classes.

He glanced down the hallway before answering.

“They moved us to Phase Two.”

I laughed nervously. “Phase Two of what?”

He didn’t smile.

“The research.”

That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

So I did what everyone does when they’re uneasy—I searched for it.

There was no record of a “Psychopathy Research Club” connected to our school. No real information about Mr. Halvorsen beyond an outdated faculty page.

But I did find something else.

An old psychology journal article discussing adolescent psychopathy markers and the ethics of early identification.

One line stood out:

>

Controlled exposure to *what*?

The next Thursday, I stayed late.

I told my parents I had detention and waited behind the gym until the school emptied out. At 3:45 PM, I saw them.

Six students. Blank expressions. Walking in silence toward the portable classroom.

Daniel was one of them.

I followed at a distance.

The door closed.

Then I heard screaming.

Not loud. Not frantic.

Measured. Repetitive.

Like someone following a script and reacting exactly when they were supposed to.

I didn’t stay long enough to hear more.

That night, Daniel texted me for the first time in weeks.

>

I didn’t reply.

I wish I had.

Two weeks later, the club was gone.

No announcement. No explanation. Mr. Halvorsen stopped working at the school. Administration called it an “unapproved extracurricular activity.”

Daniel was never the same after that.

He didn’t become violent.  
That’s the worst part.

He became *efficient*.

He graduated early. Got into a good college. Landed a good job. He learned exactly what to say, how to say it, and when. He mirrored emotions perfectly.

The last time I saw him in person, I asked one question.

“What did you actually do in that club?”

He thought for a long time.

“They weren’t studying us,” he finally said.

“They were making sure you weren’t like us.”

Last week, I got an email from my old high school.

They’re reopening the portable classrooms.

They’re also looking for alumni volunteers.

One of the attachments was an old parental consent form.

Beneath the scanned ink, barely visible, was a handwritten note:

**“Phase Three requires adult subjects.”**
