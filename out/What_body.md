Only when I switched off the blender could I hear an ongoing knocking sound at the door.  
"Jim....Can you get that please? I am bit busy here" I yelled to my husband as my clothes were covered in flour. 
"Jim?"
No answer.
So I removed my apron and hurried towards the front door to check who was there. Just when I passed the living room I saw the shadow of my husband disappearing through our bedroom door in the darkness at the corner. The football match he had been watching with a huge interest since an hour was still playing on the TV.
"Why can't he at least answer the door? Am I the servant of this house? I have to cook, clean, wash... and now answer the freaking door too" I thought angrily.

"Good evening Mrs. Whitely, I'm officer Green from the Texas PD.. This is my colleague officer Diaz."
"Hi!"
"Do you know this girl, Mrs. Whitely?"
Officer Green handed me a photograph.
"Yeah, I know her. This is Jennifer... Jennifer Blake... She lives across the street...That house right there.." I said while pointing my finger at Jennifer's house that was merely five houses away from ours.
"I am friends with her mother Jane Blake.. Jen also come here with Jane for a cup of tea sometimes."
"I see... Mrs. Whitely, I got some bad news here. Jen has been missing since yesterday.. Her parents informed us this morning and we are still looking for her.
"Oh god...!" I muttered. "Last night Jane called me too, asking whether I have seen Jen.. I didn't think it was a big deal back then and Just told her that I haven't, but will let her know if I do.. But after a while my husband came home from work with an injured leg so I had to hurry him to the ER and completely forgot about Jen" 
Officer Diaz lifted his head as he heard about Jim's injury.
"We are sorry to hear that Mrs. Whitely.. What has happened to Mr. Whitely's leg?"
"He said something heavy fell onto his leg, Not a very big deal... Anyway the ER took good care of him. Now he is inside watching the football game."
Diaz moved his head to the side and looked past myself standing at the door. 
"I guess the game is boring Mrs. Whitely.. " he said with a suspicious look on his face..
"All matches are boring these days Diaz. Nothing can compare to the energy of the 90s football players.." Officer Green laughed. "Lets move on to the next house on the list.. We've got a lot to cover.. Thank you for helping us Mrs. Whitely... We will come back if we need anything"
"Anytime officer"
"Wish a speedy recovery to Mr. Whitely"
"Thanks" I said while waving my hand at them.

Before getting inside I stayed a couple minutes holding the door open and looking at the two officers leaving. As I stood there I saw Diaz turning his head towards our home twice and muttering something to officer Green's ear.. To whatever he said Green responded with a cheerful laugh and a friendly double pat on his back. Even they were far away I could still hear officer Green saying "No way Diaz, stop overthinking things" amidst his laugh. 

"Close the door Susan, Its cold inside" I heard Jim's unusually mild voice behind my back. For an unknown reason a chilling current went through my spine as i heard his voice behind me. 
"Jim..." I said as my voice was still shaking.
"Some officers came by..."
"I am starving Susan.. Can you please get back to cooking"
"But Jim I was gonna te.."
"I don't care who stopped by or who said what, Susan! I dont want to hear it right now.. And I want you to get! my! f*king! dinner! on the table" Jim yelled while thudding on the table as he spoke. He seemed out of this world. Acting weirdly like being possessed. He seemed angry to an extent I have never seen before.
"What do you want me to do? Run on every fucking street yelling her name? Get on the floor and cry until they found her body?? Huh?"

Standing there I just froze. I couldn't feel my legs. I couldn't feel my breathing.. I just... literally froze. I couldn't walk. I couldn't talk or I couldn't even breathe.. I was in an utter shock on what I just heard. 
"What "her" jim??? Huh?? And...and "what body"?? What are you talking about?" I muttered at the very first moment I gained the ability to speak.... Hearing my shaky words Jim seemed thunderstuck. I guess he was gaining his full senses now too.
"I never said it was a "her" Jim! You..you never let me speak... How did you.. how did you know?"
"Susan!"
"What body, Jim? What.fucking.body are you talking about??" 
"Susan!"

I turned back to run towards the front door as I saw Jim standing up from his chair to approach me. All my senses started yelling "RUN" and that's all I knew I should do. But my shaking legs were not fast enough and before I could reach the door I could feel the strong grip of Jim's arms around my tiny body, and through the opening of the door I could see the blurred images of officers Green and Diaz walking away at a distant. Just when I started to yell at them I could feel Jim's strong hand covering my mouth, and his new weird soft mild voice whisper in my ear, "Not just one body darling Susie, now there will be two!'
