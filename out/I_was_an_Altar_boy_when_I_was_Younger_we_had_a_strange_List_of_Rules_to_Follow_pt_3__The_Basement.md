The echoing hymns filled the dimly lit chapel of St. Michael’s as the congregation joined each other in worship. I sat beside my new friend Michael, my thoughts wandering away from the devotion around me. Sarah, the relentless bully of the orphanage, was there, her small hands clasped together in earnest prayer.  
  
Her sudden display of piety piqued my curiosity. It was hard to believe that this was the same girl who had tormented me since I arrived at St. Michael's. In my short time here, I'd learned to loathe her, but now I found myself wondering why she constantly bullies everyone around her.  
  
Unable to keep my thoughts to myself, I whispered to Michael, "Do you know why Sarah is always so mean?"  
  
Michael's gaze remained fixed on the altar. "There's a rumor," he replied hesitantly, his voice barely audible above the choir's hymn. "I heard it from an older orphan." He paused and glanced at me, his eyes conveying reluctance. "It's about her and the basement."  
  
My heart skipped a beat at the mention of the basement. I had been fixated on uncovering the mysteries hidden within the church's depths ever since my mother's troubling ordeal. The idea of the basement being involved in Sarah's change of heart piqued my curiosity.  
  
"Tell me more," I urged Michael, eager for any shred of information.  
  
Michael sighed, his unease evident in his eyes. "I don't know all the details," he confessed. "But the rumor goes that she and a friend went down there, and something happened. Her friend... they got adopted." He lowered his voice as he continued, "It's said that she won't go near the basement anymore, that it haunts her."  
  
Michael's reluctance to delve further into the unsettling rumors surrounding Sarah and the basement was evident in his somber expression. However, I couldn't resist the temptation to unravel the mystery. I pressed him with a furrowed brow, "Adopted? You mean they  disappeared?"  
  
Michael's voice trembled slightly as he replied, "I don't want to talk about it anymore, Andy. It's just a rumor, you know?"  
  
I reluctantly accepted his response, yet my thoughts were consumed by the newfound information. If Sarah had, in some way, lost a friend to the basement's enigma, it was a weak spot that I could exploit. Perhaps I could force her to reveal more about that hidden underground world. I knew it was morally wrong, but I justified it by thinking it was a way to get back at her for the relentless bullying. In my mind, the best-case scenario was extracting more information about the mysterious basement, while the worst-case scenario involved her hitting me once again, sending me straight to the nurses' office. There, maybe I could extract information from a nurse. It was a risk I was willing to take to find the truth.  
  
As the worship came to a close, my thoughts once again drifted to the ever-watchful statue of St. Agnes. I couldn't escape the sensation that her cold, lifeless gaze was upon me. In response, I closed my eyes tightly as the prayers filled the chapel.  
  
For the entire duration of the prayer, I didn't dare to open my eyes, instead focusing on the hushed voices of the congregation around me. The uncomfortable feeling of being observed persisted until the last note of the hymn echoed through the chapel.  
  
When the prayer ended, and the final hymn began, I cautiously opened my eyes, but my gaze remained fixed on the dusty floor, avoiding the unsettling presence of the statue. I was determined to uncover the mysteries hidden within St. Michael's, even if it meant braving the ominous depths of the basement or confronting the chilling stare of St. Agnes herself.  
  
The next day, during playtime in the courtyard, I tried to immerse myself in games and laughter, a temporary respite from the mysteries and shadows of St. Michael's. But it wasn't long before Sarah, with her cruel intentions, made her way towards me, her icy eyes fixed on her target.  
  
She approached me with a sly smile, attempting to start her usual bullying routine. This time, however, I saw my  opportunity—a way to get back to the nurse's office, or to extract information from Sarah.  
  
As she began her taunts, I decided to confront her directly, my voice unwavering. "Sarah, do you know anything about the basement?" I asked, my gaze piercing into hers.  
  
Her smile faltered for a brief moment, and she seemed to pale. But quickly, she recovered and tried to bully me as a distraction, pushing me with more force than usual. I resisted the urge to retaliate and pressed further.  
  
"Why won't you answer, Sarah? Are you scared?" I challenged her.  
  
Sarah's frustration boiled over, and she struck me with a sudden, swift blow that sent me sprawling to the ground. I lay there, dazed and disoriented, as she stood over me, her eyes teary but defiant.  
  
"Never go into the basement," she whispered, “unless you want to go missing too,” her voice trembling and her eyes pointed down, staring into the grass. In her expression, I saw only sorrow, instantly making me regret pushing her to this outburst. Without another word, she turned and ran away, leaving me bewildered and shaken.   
  
Before I could chase after her or fully process what had just happened, a nun appeared, having missed the altercation. She asked if I was okay, concern in her eyes, and without waiting for a response, she sent me to the nurse's office.  
  
As I made my way down the familiar hallways of St. Michael's, I couldn't shake the urgency of the warning Sarah had given me. The basement remained a forbidden enigma, and it seemed that even the children here, like Sarah, carried the weight of its secrets.  
  
Back in the medical office again, I sat on the same worn chair, my face throbbing from where I was struck by Sarah. Sister Catherine, the head nurse, moved with a practiced grace as she attended to my injury.  
  
As she worked, I couldn't help but let my curiosity guide my words. "Sister Catherine, can you tell me more about my mom?" I asked, my voice trembling with the weight of my longing.  
  
Sister Catherine paused, her gaze distant as she remembered. "Your mother was a troubled soul, Andy," she said softly. "She sought refuge here when she was pregnant with you. We did our best to provide her with support during a difficult time."  
  
I absorbed her words, but my thirst for answers wasn't satisfied, since she hadn’t told me anything new. With a mixture of hesitation and determination, I asked the question that had been burning in my mind. "Did my mom go into the basement?"  
  
Sister Catherine's face turned pale, and she looked at me with a mixture of surprise and fear. Her voice was strained as she replied, "Andy, you mustn't ask about the basement. It's a forbidden topic, and it's not something you should be concerned with."  
  
A wave of guilt washed over me as I realized I had crossed a line, delving into a subject that was clearly off-limits. "I'm sorry, Sister," I stammered, feeling the weight of my transgression. "I didn't mean to ask about something forbidden."  
  
Sister Catherine nodded, her stern demeanor returning. "You must seek forgiveness for your curiosity during confession after mass today, Andy. Father Matthias will guide you."  
  
As she finished treating my bruises, I left the medical office, my mind filled with a mix of emotions. But something about Sister Catherine's reaction had unsettled me. Her fear and the secrecy surrounding the basement hinted at a much deeper and darker mystery lurking within St. Michael's. And as I left the room, I couldn't help but study her face one last time, noting the fear etched in her eyes, a fear that mirrored my own growing apprehension. A fear that I’ve seen once before, on my mother’s face on that dreadful day she was taken away from me, leaving me stranded here.  
  
Another day passed and I was huddled with the faithful again, deep in prayer. Soon, the time came for confession, the part of the service I had both anticipated and dreaded. This time, it was my duty to confess my sins to Father Matthias, but the thought of uttering my transgression—the sin of inquiring about the basement—filled me with unease.  
  
My apprehension grew as I found myself standing in line, waiting for my turn to confess my sins. Memories of the last time I sat  in the confessional booth haunted my thoughts. It was an experience that had left an indelible mark on my soul, an encounter with the church's eerie alternate version, where the pews rotted away, the floor was cracked and unstable, and the night sky was starless. In that surreal world, all the statues crumbled to ruin, except for St. Agnes, who moved with unsettling fluidity.  
  
I shivered at the recollection, still haunted by the feeling of the eyes in the darkness staring at me, unrelenting and disconcerting. They belonged to a shadowy presence with hands, eerily elongated and bony, fingers crackling and twitching with grotesque fascination as they slowly reached out from the abyss.  
  
With a deep, steadying breath, I entered the confessional, its wooden frame creaking softly under my touch. I settled into the booth, the dim light and hushed atmosphere enveloping me as I waited to find the courage to speak. .  
  
After a moment, with my heart heavy, I took a deep breath and began my confession, my voice soft and quivering with guilt. "Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been only a day or two since my last confession."  
  
From behind the screen, Father Matthias's gentle voice responded, "Go on, my child. Speak your heart."  
  
I hesitated for a moment, struggling to find the words. "Father, I... I asked about the basement. I inquired about it, even though I knew it was forbidden."  
  
There was a brief pause, and then Father Matthias's voice, filled with understanding, replied, "I see, Andy. Curiosity can be a powerful temptation."  
  
Encouraged by his understanding, I continued, "But, Father, what's so special about the basement? Why is it forbidden?"  
  
There was a subtle shift in Father Matthias's tone, a hint of sternness mixed with compassion. "The basement is a place shrouded in mystery, my child. It holds secrets that are not meant for young eyes or curious minds."  
  
I couldn't help but press further, my curiosity unquenched. "But Father, I need to know. It feels like there's something hidden there, something important. Please, can you tell me more?"  
  
Father Matthias sighed softly, his voice tinged with resignation. "Andy, you must trust that there are reasons certain things are kept hidden. Some mysteries are best left unsolved. I implore you, do not ask about the basement or try to look into it any further. It is for your safety, and the safety of all who reside here. You are committing a sin each time you ask further. Forget about the basement."  
  
His words hung heavily in the air, a reminder of the boundaries I had crossed and the secrets I had uncovered, and I asked for forgiveness again. As I sat there in the dimly lit confessional, I couldn't help but feel the weight of St. Michael's mysteries pressing down upon me, a reminder that some questions were better left unanswered.  
  
Still inside the confessional, I hesitated before slowly creaking the door open, unsure of what awaited me beyond. As the wooden door swung ajar, my eyes fell upon the nightmarish scene that I had hoped never to revisit. The once sacred chapel had transformed into a twisted realm of decay, shrouded in shadows.  
  
Broken windows allowed the inky darkness to seep into the sacred space, and the pews were now rotten and falling apart. The floor was cracked and uneven, a stark contrast to the pristine tiles I knew so well. Most disturbing was the absence of stars in the night sky outside, as if the very heavens had abandoned this place.  
  
My breath quickened, and a sense of dread overcame me. I dared not step outside the confessional, instead choosing to take in the unsettling sights from the safety of my small compartment. It was then that I heard it, the faint sounds of popping and cracking, emanating from the darkest corners of the eerie chapel.  
  
The source of these dreadful noises became apparent as I shifted my gaze. From the shadows emerged bony, elongated fingers, their wicked digits inching toward me, reminiscent of the encounter I had tried to forget. The gnarled hands reached for me with deliberate slowness, stretching out of the abyss, making my heart race with terror.  
  
My eyes followed the grotesque appendages to their origin in the dark corner of the chapel, and there, I saw them—the eyes in the darkness, unblinking and malevolent, staring back at me with an intensity that brought me right back to when I first encountered this demented version of the church. The sinister gaze remained locked upon me as I clutched the door, slowly pulling it closed as I shut my eyes.  
  
After what felt like an eternity, Father Matthias gently inquired if there was anything more I wished to confess. My voice quivered as I managed to whisper a shaky "No" in response. I closed the confessional door, sealing the haunting vision back into the recesses of memory, and was relieved to find myself once again in the familiar and uncorrupted chapel. The memories of this experience lingered in my mind all day long, making it hard for me to focus on anything but the mysteries that shroud this cursed orphanage.   
  
Sometime later, in the dead of night, I was jolted awake by the unmistakable sound of my door unlocking with a soft click. My heartbeat steadily increased as my eyes darted toward the door, which had creaked open ever so slightly.  
  
Dread washed over me as I awaited the next sinister revelation, my mind racing with fear. I watched in terror as a dark, slender finger, much like the one I had seen in the chapel, appeared near the floor, slowly slipping through the gap between my door and its frame.  
  
My breath caught in my throat as I believed the malevolent entity from the shadows had returned to torment me once more. But then, to my surprise, the finger revealed itself to be the tail of a black cat. My confusion mingled with relief as I realized it was not a monstrous apparition but a simple feline visitor.  
  
The cat let out a playful meow, its sleek, swaying tail reflecting the faint moonlight filtering through the window. It meowed a few more times, its voice soft and inviting, before the tail slipped out into the hallway.  
  
Compelled by curiosity and the desire for a moment of reprieve from the unsettling events of the past days, I abandoned caution. I pushed aside the rule about people knocking at my door at night, failing to recognize the possibility that this could be yet another deceptive ploy by the supernatural forces lurking within St. Michael's. In my innocence, I believed it to be nothing more than a harmless cat, and I couldn't resist the urge to follow it into the unknown darkness of the night.  
  
Cautiously, I crept into the hallway, my footsteps slow and hushed. I looked right, finding nothing but the eerie stillness of the night. Then, to my left, I caught a fleeting glimpse of the cat's rear end as it playfully rounded a corner, emitting a soft meow as it disappeared from sight.  
  
My curiosity piqued, I followed the cat, convinced that this was just a simple game it wanted to play. Silently, I trailed after it, my senses sharp and alert. It led me through the dimly lit corridors, its meows acting as breadcrumbs guiding my way.  
  
Eventually, we arrived at the chapel. I peeked my head inside, catching sight of the cat as it rounded another corner, vanishing into a back area of the chapel. I followed without hesitation, drawn deeper into the demonic depths of St. Michael's. In my childish haste, I failed to notice the absence of St. Agnes, it’s only in hindsight that I realize that disturbing fact.   
  
Within the back area of the chapel, a place I had never been, I could hardly see anything, due to the low light. Just as I made out the silhouette of the cat, it scurried behind another door, into another room, which I had never seen before.   
  
As I approached the dark room the cat had entered, I inspected the door and was taken aback by what I found. A large chain lock dangled from a latch on the door, and the key sat invitingly within. It was as if someone had left it there intentionally, granting me access to the door. I pulled the door open, revealing a sight that left me utterly shocked—it was not a room at all, but a descending staircase.  
  
My heart pounded as I realized the implications of this discovery. It was a staircase leading somewhere underground, a place concealed from the eyes of the world above. But before I could fully process the situation, I heard another meow, this time from down below, at the end of the staircase.  
  
Against my better judgment, I took a few steps down into the darkness. The sense of dread that had been building inside me intensified as I stared into the darkness. I realized that I was breaking the most important rule of all—to never venture into the basement. Panic surged through me as I snapped out of my momentary lapse of judgment, and I turned to retreat.  
  
But as I attempted to move back up the stairs, I found that I couldn't move my legs. I slowly looked down, and the sight I was met with still haunts me to this day. Two slender, unnatural hands had clasped around my ankles, their grip firm and unyielding. The arms they were attached to stretched impossibly into the darkness. I struggled in vain, realizing that these abhorrent appendages allowed me to move only in one direction—further down into the unknown depths.  
  
When I tried turning back, I would be met with an equal, but opposite force pulling me down, keeping me in place. The pressure only let up as I stepped forward. I tried crawling away, but the hands wouldn’t budge. I tried screaming for help, but nobody answered. With a sinking feeling of despair, I had no choice but to descend further into the darkness, each step taking me farther away from the safety of the chapel.  
  
As I descended the never-ending staircase, guided by the unseen entity, my apprehension grew with each step. The only illumination in this subterranean labyrinth came from the dim glow emanating from a doorway at the end of a long, narrow hallway.  
  
I continued to look down at the hands that clung to my ankles, their black, bony fingers attached to grotesque arms, seemingly stretching infinitely into the oppressive darkness. The sense of dread weighed heavily on my chest as I moved forward, helpless and at the mercy of whatever forces were guiding me.  
  
Finally, the entity led me into a dimly lit room that seemed to serve as some sort of storage area. Filing cabinets lined the walls, filled with documents, while religious trinkets and mysterious sigils adorned the space. In the center of the room, a table held a folder, and I couldn't resist the urge to investigate further.  
  
I opened the folder and was met with a shock that made my stomach drop. Inside was a photograph of my mother, along with various documents detailing her medical information. My heart ached as I realized that this place held secrets about her, secrets I had never known.  
  
But as I continued to sift through the papers, my attention was drawn to something even more perplexing hidden inside the folder—a set of documents detailing strange sigils alongside a cryptic ritual. I couldn't comprehend their purpose, but it was clear that they held an otherworldly significance.  
  
Among the details, I found what appeared to be the outline of a spell, one designed to extract evil from within a possessed person. My mind raced with confusion and fear as I tried to piece together the significance of these revelations.  
  
Before I could make sense of it all, an unmistakable creak echoed from the bottom of the staircase, shattering the eerie silence. I froze, my heart pounding as I realized that I was not alone in this hidden chamber of secrets. It couldn’t have been the creature from the darkness, since I could feel it holding me still, but its grip began to loosen as a response to the noise.   
  
As the hands around my ankles slowly released their grip and retreated into the shadows, I breathed a sigh of momentary relief. But that respite was short-lived, for soon, my senses were assaulted by the ominous sound of heavy, clunky footsteps echoing from behind me.  
  
I turned my gaze down the hallway, my eyes straining to discern the approaching figure in the dim light. It moved in a jerky, unnatural manner, its joints pivoting at inexplicable intervals. The silhouette was undoubtedly that of a person, but something about it was profoundly unsettling. It moved with the mechanical precision of a robot,  simultaneously coupled  with the erratic convulsions of a possessed entity.  
  
As the figure drew closer and came into view of the dim light, my heart seized with terror. It was St. Agnes, the very statue that had cast its evil gaze upon me during Mass. But now, it had taken on a nightmarish form.  
  
Blood oozed continuously from its eye sockets in a macabre stream, its head twitching and shaking with unnatural spasms. In its left hand, it held a knife, its blade adorned with symbols and markings that suggested ritualistic intent. The statue now stood at the doorway, blocking my only escape route, its body convulsing and contorting with random, unnatural movements.  
  
Time seemed to stretch into an eternity as I stood there, frozen in the presence of this nightmarish apparition. Its lifeless, blank expression betrayed no emotion, and yet, the murderous intent emanating behind those blank eyes was undeniable, making it abundantly clear that whatever force now possessed St. Agnes was beyond the realm of comprehension.  
  
As the demonic statue stood before me, its head began to swivel in an eerie slow motion pattern. The atmosphere grew increasingly surreal as the movements became quicker and they began ending with strong jerks of motion. With each violent jerk of St Agnes’ head, the blood that poured from its eyes splattered the room more and more in grotesque patterns, staining the floor, walls, and even the ceiling.  
  
Suddenly, the statue's movements grew erratic, its head swiveling at an inhuman speed, causing the blood to splatter in every direction like a sprinkler of blood. It charged toward me, its limbs flailing violently as it moved in a horrifying dance of malevolence. I could do nothing but cower in fear, my eyes locked in on the nightmarish spectacle unfolding before me.  
  
But then, amidst the chaos, I noticed a dark, slender hand emerging from the shadows, its bony fingers sliding across the floor. It grasped the statue's ankle, just as it had clung to mine earlier, and with a swift, powerful motion, it tripped the grotesque figure, sending it hurtling headfirst in my direction.  
  
I reacted with instinctive agility, diving out of the way just in time. The statue collided with the wooden table, shattering it into pieces. Papers from the folder flew into the air, scattered by the impact.  
  
St. Agnes struggled to rise, but the unseen hand from the shadows continued to wrestle with it, pulling it down and preventing its escape. And as I watched this surreal battle unfold, I couldn't help but notice a pair of eyes in the darkness, the same eyes that my mother and I had encountered not long ago. I’m sure of it now.  
  
Fear raced down my spine as I realized that these eyes were not a mere manifestation of fear or delusion—they were very real, and they held an imposing power that defied explanation.  
  
Amidst the chaotic struggle between the statue of St. Agnes and the fiendish shadow and the sounds of popping and creaking joints coupled with the sounds of heavy stone against the concrete floor, I noticed the second hand of the shadowy entity reaching out from the darkness. Its bony fingers pointed toward one of the scattered documents—a piece of my mother's medical history. A surge of curiosity and desperation overcame me, and I dashed to grab the paper, seemingly understanding the wishes of the creature that had tormented me since I got here.   
  
But just as I reached out to retrieve it, St. Agnes broke free from the shadow's grasp and lunged toward me with frightening speed. Fear surged through me, and I barely managed to evade the statue's grasp. I watched in horror as both hands of the shadowy figure wrapped around St. Agnes—one around its neck and the other on its left hand, the one clutching the ritualistic knife.  
  
Desperation drove me to snatch the paper, but just as I laid my hands on it, the right hand of that awful statue pierced out from the darkness, clutching half of the page, crumbling it with its powerful grip. For a brief moment, it was a tug of war between me and the stone hand of St. Agnes. With a violent jerk, the paper tore in two. I clutched my portion, as the creature in the darkness, with its eerie strength, dragged the statue into the shadows with a collection of pops and creaks emitting from its otherworldly joints, the two monsters vanishing from sight.  
  
I ran away from the nightmarish sounds of the two demonic forces fighting and towards the doorway of this strange room, but stopped for a moment. As I stood there, panting and bewildered, I cast a final glance back, my eyes locking onto the enigmatic eyes in the darkness. There was a strange sincerity in those eyes, a depth of emotion I hadn't noticed before. But I had no time to contemplate this newfound realization.  
  
With a shudder, I turned away and sprinted down the hallway, my footsteps echoing in the oppressive silence of the hallway, a stark contrast to the struggling sounds of violence emanating from the room I left behind. I raced up the stairs and slammed the door shut, locking the padlock behind me. The sounds of the battle between the two unnatural entities faded into the distance, leaving me with a sense of unease and dread that lingered long after I had escaped.  
  
As I stood there, leaning against the basement door, clutching the torn scrap of my mother's medical documents, I waited in tense silence. Minutes stretched into an agonizing eternity, but I heard no more sounds of the eerie battle that had unfolded moments ago. Relief washed over me, and I let out a trembling sigh as tears began to pour out.  
  
Collapsing to the floor, I now sat in the dim light, the torn document cradled in my trembling hands. Wiping my eyes, I started inspecting this mysterious scrap of paper. Among the various checklists and questions on the torn paper, my eyes were drawn to one in particular—the one that pertained to my mother's pregnancy. It asked about the gender of the baby, and my heart raced as I continued to scan the document, hardly able to see through the steady stream of tears flowing from my eyes..  
  
After wiping my tears with my shirt, I was finally able to properly read the words on the page and what I discovered in that chilling moment struck me like a bolt of lightning. The box next to “boy” was checked, and the box next to "girl" remained empty, as expected. However, an additional box was also selected—labeled clearly on the paper was a checked box next to the word…. "twins."
