I had been sleeping poorly. For weeks, perhaps since the house became empty and human voices vanished from its hallways. But that night was different. I dreamt something I haven't been able to forget, even though I've tried with methods more rational than poetic. Something that clung to my body like a pungent smell, like a subcutaneous hum.

In the dream, I was part of a hive. I wasn't observing the bees. I was one of them. But not like a human disguised as an insect, not with fake antennae or an anthropomorphized body. I was a bee in its entirety: its sensory field, its exoskeleton, its consciousness divided between individual will and collective impulse. Everything vibrated. Everything smelled. Everything moved in patterns I understood without comprehending.

The hive wasn't a common honeycomb. It didn't hang from a branch or hide in a natural cavity. It was... organic, yes, but also in another way. The hexagons seemed to pulse, moist, as if they were breathing. They opened and closed with a cadence reminiscent of an animal's diaphragm while asleep. The walls were covered with a warm, gelatinous substance that wasn't wax or honey, but something like flesh. And the worst: the sound. A choral hum, like thousands of thoughts stitched together, but suddenly distorted, as if something or someone was trying to speak through it. They weren't words; it felt more like an intention, a presence using the hum as a mouth.

I tried to move, to fly. But the wings didn't obey. I felt a larva inside me, not literally, but as if I were incubating something, as if that hive didn't contain me but was forming me from within. Then something changed. I began to understand the pattern of the hum. As if the pheromones crossing the air were also syntax, the language of the swarm. And what they said, what they repeated over and over, was a question directed toward a specific cell of the hive that didn't seem made to contain honey or a larva. It was a different cell, covered with black wax, as if it were charred. The other bees avoided it, but I didn't. I was drawn to it, as if it were mine, as if it belonged to me, I felt it was mine. I crawled over the surface of the honeycomb, and when I touched that cell, the hum ceased, and I heard a word, a single one. Not a name. Not a verb. A word that in the dream was perfectly understandable, although now only its resonance remains, like a wet silhouette on a fogged mirror.

I woke up drenched in sweat, my mouth dry, my nails dug into the palms of my hands. An invisible hum lingered behind my ears, like the echo of something that doesn't belong to the dream or wakefulness. I didn't remember that word, but everything else was fresh in my memory; I could recount it perfectly, as I am doing now. The only thing I didn't remember and still don't is that word. I shook myself a bit before getting out of bed; that had been the strangest and craziest dream I'd ever hadâ€”well, a dream I remembered.

At that time, I was a biology student, about to finish my degree; only the graduation requirement remained. I had decided to work on a thesis instead of doing an internship. Why? I don't even know; if I had taken the other option, maybe none of what happened afterward would have occurred, and I wouldn't have ended up medicated. My thesis focused on the sensory allometry of Apis mellifera, the honey bees. Hence the reason for that dream; it's not that in the realm of Morpheus I had become an expert on bees. I was fascinated by the precision of their bodies, the way the growth of their sensory organs relates to body size. Everything could be measured. Graphed. Understood. I suppose I was attracted to precision itself.

I lived in an old university house, in a city I prefer not to name. The walls were always damp and smelled of old books. Before the 2020 pandemic, eight students lived there. Each in their room, sharing coffee, insomnia, laughter, and existential crises. But when the quarantine began, everyone returned to their homes. Everyone had a place to go back to, except me. I stayed alone... six months locked in that house, surviving on delivery food and sporadic video calls. At first, solitude was a luxury. Not having to share the kitchen, the bathroom, the laundry. Not hearing doors closing or other people's footsteps. But over time, the silence mutated. It became thick, like a substance. I spoke with my advisor once a week. Sometimes I exchanged messages with Alejandra, a friend from my program who was also writing from her city, with her parents, with other humans, unlike me. The rest was silence, hums, and the sound old things make when they think no one is listening.

There, amid routine and isolation, the boundary between the real and... the other began to blur. It all started with a file. One morning, while reviewing a fragment of the morphometric analysis of Apis mellifera worker bees, I noticed a sentence I didn't remember writing: "Compound eyes are an architecture of surveillance. Each segment watches, records, and remembers." I deleted it, assuming I had copied it by mistake from some neuroethology article. But the next day, there was another new sentence: "The queen watches even when she sleeps." I decided to change the file's password, made a copy on a USB, and another in the cloud. I started reviewing the change history; clearly, no one else had accessed the computer... I repeat, I was alone.

I simply attributed everything to fatigue, loneliness, the pandemic, and the latent stress of dying and still having to pretend normality and continue with our lives, continue working on a thesis to graduate and have opportunities in a future I didn't know if it would come.

However, things didn't adopt a tone of sanity despite being aware of the probable alteration of reality that my mind might be suffering. One day, a jar of honey appeared on the kitchen table. It had no label, and I hadn't ordered it... at least I didn't remember buying it. I wasn't a honey enthusiast; sometimes I used it to sweeten the teas I drank, but now I lived 80% thanks to coffee, so it wasn't possible that I had made that purchase. The honey had a darker color than commercial honey and a slightly metallic smell. I decided to try it; maybe it was a jar of the honey we had extracted in the lab, the one that had been gifted to the university's administrative staff and deans. Its taste was strange, like old wood; it wasn't pleasant, and I didn't know where it came from; maybe one of the guys who lived with me had forgotten it. So I threw the jar away, but... it reappeared.

I remembered wrapping the jar in paper towels and throwing it in the trash can. However, the next morning, that jar was intact on the kitchen counter again. I wrote to Alejandra to tell her what was happening to me; I had already told her about the sentences I didn't remember writing, and she, like me, attributed it to stress, but this? Alejandra, worried about my increasingly erratic messages, offered to come visit me, and I accepted with relief. She had a special permit to move around the city since she, along with other microbiologists, was working in the university's laboratories with samples from people infected with the pandemic disease, to determine if there was contagion or not. It was an offer made by our university due to the pandemic status the disease had reached worldwide. When she arrived, she hugged me as if I had been sick.

"When was the last time you went out to the garden?" she asked me.

"A week ago," I replied.

But when we opened the back door, we found a completely different garden. Darker, with trees I didn't recognize. As if they had aged decades in a few months. That garden was completely neglected; even when there were more people, there were only weeds acting as yellowish grass, seedlings that wouldn't get far, and even two trees that hadn't changed much in the time I'd been living in that house, and that had been almost five years. I didn't say anything, not because what I was seeing or feeling was a lie, but because Alejandra didn't. She knew that house; we had gone many times to hang out there, to drink, to read; she had even brought her dog Haru. If she didn't notice any difference, then... what was happening to me? Damn stress.

The last night, while Alejandra slept in my room, I went down to the improvised lab I had set up in the old library. The bees were restless, as their hum was more intense and, at the same time, more harmonious. When I approached the aquarium that was supposed to be a hive, I saw that with their bodies they had formed a precise figure: an incomplete hexagon. The same one that had appeared in the thesis, in my dreams. Then something crossed my mind, that maybe there was no difference between my study, my thoughts, and the hive. In my mind, there was a certainty, a certainty that something had opened... something was using me to write. That's why random sentences, sentences I didn't remember thinking or writing, appeared in my documents, in my thesis draft; it had to be that.

The truth is, I'm not sure if that's what really happened. Maybe it was all a symptom of confinement, of loneliness. Maybe it still is. Over time, the confinement ended. Not overnight, of course, but the authorities relaxed the measures, the university reopened gradually, and some voices returned to the hallways. Alejandra returned to the city; we saw each other one afternoon, in silence, after months of out-of-sync messages and video calls with poor connection. She asked me if I was okay, and I said yes. We both knew it was a lie, but neither wanted to correct the other.

The thesis was submitted. I remember the strange weight of having it printed in my hands. "Sensory allometry in Apis mellifera during early larval development and its possible relation to caste differentiation." A technical, clean, neat title. Nothing in that title alluded to the vertigo I felt while writing it, nor to the paranoia that grew like mold between the folds of confinement. The defense was virtual; they congratulated me, and I remember one of the jurors used the word "solid." Everything was solid, firm, scientific, rational. And yet, when I hung up the call, I felt a cold shiver down my back. As if someone had been listening from another room, like that feeling of being watched.

Days later, one morning without dates or sense, I couldnâ€™t get out of bed. I spent nearly two weeks shut in againâ€”this time without a pandemic, without a thesis, without excuses. It was Alejandra who found me and took me to the hospital. I was diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. The psychiatrist explained everything with professional calm: prolonged isolation, academic stress, sleep deprivation, possible genetic predisposition. She prescribed anxiolytics, antidepressants, and a mild hypnotic to help me sleep. Since then, that chemical combination has been with me. Some days I forget who I was before. Other days, I prefer not to remember.

I never worked with bees again. I tried a couple of times, at the beginning. I visited an apiary with a colleague, more out of politeness than genuine interest. But the buzzing... that buzzing. Not the one from real bees, but the other oneâ€”lower, more intimate, the one that doesnâ€™t travel through the air but inside the skull. That one is still there. I gave up the experiments. I left sensory entomology. I requested a transfer. Now I teach molecular and cell biology at the same university. The students listen attentively, and some even ask why I never talk about hymenopterans (bees, wasps, ants)... since itâ€™s the field I graduated from. I just smile and change the subject.

Sometimesâ€”not always, but on some nightsâ€”when sleep evades me even with the help of the pills, the buzzing returns. Not as an actual sound. More like a presence, a mental frequency. It's there when silence is absolute, when my breathing sounds louder than it should, when the darkness feels thicker than usual. And then I remember: the living hive, the cell sealed with black wax, the buzzing that spoke, the buzzing with a mouth.

Sometimes, I think I hear that shapeless word again, the one revealed to me in dreams and forgotten upon waking. Or maybe I didnâ€™t forget it. Maybe Iâ€™m just incubating it.
