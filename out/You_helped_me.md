My windshield wipers squeak back and forth as they push the rain off my windshield.

I watch them for a few moments.

Right.. Left.. Right.. Left

I hum a tune to go along with the subtle squeak.

It’s mindless, but it helps me forget I have to be at work in 5 min-

I glance at the clock on the dash.

“Shit.”, I mutter, grabbing my purse and opening the door of my sedan.

I walk briskly to the front door of the diner and swing it open, the warmth inside immediately heating my skin as I shake out my hair.

“Camilla, you’re late.”, Jeff calls from behind the counter, pouring coffee into a mug.

“By two minutes, sorry. I was here, I zoned out in my car..”, I say, rounding the edge to the kitchen to put my things down.

“Well then you can stay two minutes later, wouldn’t want your time card off.”, he says, with a grin.

“Oh, yeah. I’m sure.”, I chuckle, grabbing some menus and beginning to wipe them down.

“Okay, but did I sound authoritative?”, he asks. Ever since his promotion from cook to manager, he has been self-conscious about his new role.

“It’s getting better!”, I say enthusiastically.

I’ve been at the diner longer than he has, but I have no interest in becoming a manager.

I tell myself to take a deep breath. I am almost done with my degree and then I can finally get a job in my field of study. I check job listings every day, hoping a spot for a school psychologist opens up soon.

Somewhere.

Anywhere.

“Daydreaming?”, he teases.

I snap out of it, shaking my head while I restart the coffee pot.

As soon as he finishes his closing work, he’s grabbing his coat to head out.

“Alright, I’m headed out. Do you need anything from me before I go home?”, he asks me.

“Nope! Have a good night, and get home safely.”, I respond, looking up from wiping down the counter in front of me.

He stays still for a beat, and then taps the counter twice with his knuckles.

“Alrighty. See ya, Cams.”, he says, waving at the last customer at the counter before heading outside.

The second the bell chimes above the door, I sigh.

I wish I didn’t find him so handsome. Oh well, soon I will be gone anyways. No point saying anything to him now.

“Anything else I can get you, sir?”, I ask the man at the counter.

The man shakes his head and smiles at me warmly.

“Nah darlin’, I’m just finishing up here and then I’m headed out. Got a bit more of a drive to San Diego.”, he tells me, stretching his arms back.

Truckers are our main customers this late at night.

Especially on this road, the path from Arizona to California. Not a whole lot out here besides us, and a few gas stations.

I nod sympathetically.

“Let me get you some coffee to take with you.”, I offer, grabbing a travel cup from below the counter and filling it to the brim.

“You’re a sweet girl..”, he squints at my name tag, “Camilla. Pretty name.”

“Thank you.. Though I can’t take credit for it.”, I say, laughing lightly.

“Now, what do I owe you for the to-go cup?”, he says, reaching for his wallet.

I wave him off.

“It’s on me, you can pay me back by making it there safe.”, I smile.

He laughs, and takes the cup.

“That other guy left, are you all alone darlin’?”, he asks, looking around the now empty diner.

I nod.

“For now, Tony will be here in about five minutes.”, I say with an easy smile.

What this man doesn’t know, is that there is no Tony, and I will be here alone tonight. Jeff told me to always say someone named Tony is coming soon, just to keep weirdos in check. I’ve never asked why, but I have never had an issue, anytime someone asks me something like that I always say Tony will be here.. Tony’s almost here.. Tony is a retired cop..

Sometimes, I even make up elaborate backstories about him.

“Tony isn’t a name you try to mess with.”, Jeff had told me.

And he was right.

The man sighs in relief.

“Oh good, you know my niece is about your age and I would get nervous about her being out here by herself. Do you want me to wait with you?”, he asks.

He seems kind, and I don’t feel threatened, but I’m still not stupid.

“Oh you’re so sweet, but I promise I’m okay. Better get on the road before your coffee gets cold.”, I say, clearing his dishes.

He laughs again.

“You’re right about that. Okay, you have a good night darlin’.”, he tells me, tipping the brim of his hat.

I smile back at him, and watch as he leaves the diner and gets in his truck.

I don’t stop watching until the headlights blink out in the distance.

I turn to put some clean mugs away, and I see Jeff’s phone, still plugged in and charging on the counter.

“Jeff…”, I sigh.

I swear that man would forget his own head if it wasn’t attached to his shoulders.

I laugh softly, and begin to wipe down every table, then I bring all the ketchup bottles to the counter to work on refilling them.

Then the ketchup makes me think of fries, and now I’m hungry.

“Early dinner break, sorry Jeff.”, I giggle, as I head back to the kitchen.

I put some fries in the fryer and lean back on the wall, waiting for the timer.

I close my eyes, and imagine my first day at a school working with kids. 

And in my mind, I’m so talented I win every education award a school psychologist can get.

I’m so good, they erect a statue in my honor.

BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ

I open my eyes and see my fries are done.

Ah, that was a nice dream. For now though, the fries will do.

I shake them into a basket, and take the basket with me to the front to continue cleaning.

As I round the corner, someone is sitting at the counter.

“Ah!”, I shriek.

The girl looks up at me, and attempts a smile.

She’s about my age, and she has her red hair in a high ponytail. A loose white T-shirt and a thin hoodie over it, raindrops having left dark spots on her clothes.

“Hi there! I’m so sorry, I didn’t hear you come in.”, I squeak out.

Her face is impassive.

“Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you.”, she says.

“No, my bad! Would you like a menu?”, I ask.

She tilts her head at me, and nods.

I slide her a menu and grab a mug.

“Can I get you something warm to drink? I’m sure you’re cold from the rain.”, I say, pouring the steaming coffee.

She looks down at the menu, analyzing every line. I see her eyes dart over each item, like she’s ticking them off in her head.

“Just coffee for now.”, she says quietly.

I nod, and gesture back to the ketchup bottles.

“Okay, I’ll be over here if you change your mind.”, I tell her.

“Thank you, Camilla.”, she responds.

I glance down at my name tag again and smile at her.

“Of course.”

I pick up a French fry from the basket to take a bite, when she speaks again.

“I’m Madison, by the way.”, she tells me.

I smile at her.

“It’s nice to meet you, Madison.”

For a while we just coexist together, listening to the premade playlist of slow 90’s country to fill the silence.

She doesn’t drink her coffee, but I do see her holding the mug. Like she’s trying to just warm up her hands.

Then the rain starts coming down harder, ricocheting off the roof in a rattling noise.

“It sure is coming down tonight..”, I mumble.

“It is.”, Madison says, eyes finding me.

“You from around here, or passing through?”, I ask, stepping towards her.

“Passing through, I grew up far from here..”, she trails off, looking outside at the rain.

“Ah, okay. Where are you headed?”, I ask.

Her expression tightens, and she looks down at the mug.

I’ve clearly made her uncomfortable.

“Sorry, you don’t have to tell me. The truckers come in and just want to talk and talk so I forgot to put my manners on. Please forgive me.”, I say quickly, looking at her apologetically.

“It’s okay, you didn’t make me uncomfortable. I’m just not sure how to answer where I’m headed…”, she says quietly.

I regard her for a moment.

Maybe she’s running away from something?

Her sleeve of her hoodie shifts and I can see a sliver of her wrist, which appears to have a healing bruise on it. Once she sees me notice, she self-consciously tugs it down as I avert my eyes. 

Someone?

“That’s okay. Any way is the right way if you don’t know where you’re going.”, I say.

“Isn’t that from Alice in Wonderland?”, she asks.

I shrug.

“Maybe, I read it in a fortune cookie once.”, I respond.

She’s quiet for a moment, and then bursts out in giggles. Which then makes me start to laugh.

I look at her again, and I can’t put my finger on it, but I know I have seen her before.

“Have you come here before? Or do you go to school nearby?”, I ask, hoping to come off as casually as I can.

“Oh.. No. I don’t go to school. I have been here before, but I don’t normally come inside.”, she responds, still weening off her giggles.

I tilt my head at her.

“You don’t come inside?”, I ask.

Her expression freezes, and her eyes widen.

“I.. Uh.. I have been here before, with someone. But normally they get takeout, so I’ve just waited in the car..”, she says slowly, like she’s choosing each word carefully.

She looks up at me, waiting for my response.

It’s not my business, so I nod.

“That makes sense.”, I say thoughtfully.

She seems to sigh in relief, then I hear a noise. Something faint, and rumbling. When the noise starts, she puts her hand over her stomach and winces, just slightly.

“Are you sure I can’t get you something to eat?”, I ask.

“Um.. What can this get me?”, she asks, pulling out a crumpled $5 from her hoodie pocket.

I look at the money, then back at her.

“And I got the coffee, so.. minus that.”, she whispers.

I can feel my heart fill with concern for this poor girl, and I have to help her.

“Do you like burgers?”, I ask.

She regards me carefully, then nods.

“I’ll be right back.”, I say, then head to the kitchen.

“Wait- Please don’t leave me alone-“, she panics, looking at the door.

I follow her eyes, and slowly head to the glass door. Locking it, and pulling the blinds down.

“Come back with me, you can help.”, I say, holding out my hand to her.

She stares at my hand, and then shakily takes it.

“Okay.”, she whispers.

When we get back into the kitchen, her eyes light up at the options of food.

“Fries?”, I ask, opening the door to the freezer.

She nods excitedly.

I shake some into the fryer basket and drop it in.

“Okay, now the burgers. I think they are the best thing on the menu, if I’m being honest.”, I explain, and her eyes watch my every movement.

“So the grill is on, and it’s hot, so we just place the patty down. Do you want to try?”, I ask.

She nods and steps closer.

“You’ve got this!”, I say reassuringly.

She places the patty down perfectly, but when the grease sizzles and pops up, she jumps back and screams.

She backs up to the wall and tucks her arms around herself, shaking and whispering.

“Woah! Hey, are you okay? Did the oil get you?”, I rush over, gently touching her arm.

She’s clutching her arm as tears begin to fall down her face, she rocks back and forth and is sobbing quietly.

“Here, let me see. I can clean it.”, I say gently.

She lets me take her arm, and when I gently push up the sleeve, there is a burn alright.

But this one didn’t just happen.

And it wasn’t just some sprayed oil from a grill.

The burn wrapped around her arm, looking healed but.. awful.

I gasp softly.

“What.. What is-“, I whisper.

Just then, I hear the front door shaking with someone banging on it.

BANG BANG BANG

Both our faces turn in that direction, and Madison begins to whimper before she puts her hand over her mouth.

“Is someone after you?”, I ask her.

BANG BANG BANG

She nods, tears running down her hands to her shirt.

“Please help me.”, she whispers.

I take her in. The fearful expression, the panic attack, the burn..

BANG BANG BANG

I have to help her.

“Okay, get in here.”, I hurry her to the door of the walk-in fridge and push her in.

BANG BANG BANG

“Don’t come out unless I tell you to.”, I say quickly, before closing it.

I quickly turn off the grill and fryer, and jog to the front door, before opening it fully.

“Hi there! Sorry about that, I was working on the dishes and didn’t hear anyone.”, I say in my best charming waitress voice.

The man waiting for me on the other end of the door is straight from a horror movie.

He wasn’t very tall, but he was stocky. Dark hair plastered his forehead and arms, and he was drenched from the rain.

His eyes.. His eyes though.. 

They looked at me like they knew all my secrets.

And he did look familiar. I don’t think I’ve waited on him directly, but he’s definitely been here before.

“Come on in and get yourself dry, can I get you something warm to drink?”, I ask as casually as I can.

He watches me cross behind the counter before he takes a step inside the diner.

“Coffee.”, is the only word he grunts.

“You got it.”, I say, grabbing a mug and pouring it to the top.

“Cream or sugar?”, I ask.

He shakes his head.

“Can I get you a menu?”, I ask.

“Has anyone else come in here tonight?”, he asks me.

I pause, and tilt my head like I’m thinking really hard.

“A trucker headed to San Diego, left a while ago. You mean him?”, I ask him.

“I’m looking for a girl. Young, red hair. You seen her?”, he asks me.

I shake my head slowly, wiping down the counter he’s sitting at.

“No, I wish. There are too many men who come through here, I would love someone to gossip with!”, and I laugh like I’m the biggest air-head in the world.

He watches me, carefully.

I just continue on with my regular nightly tasks, trying not to think about the girl in the walk-in.

“You all alone here?”, he finally asks.

I nod while brewing more coffee.

“For now, Tony will be here in a few minutes though. He had a boxing match tonight, so he couldn’t come in until after.”, I ramble.

Tony has quite the backstory.

The man studies me, like he’s trying to figure out if I’m lying.

Shit.

“You hungry?”, I ask, glancing at the menu I left in front of him.

He shakes his head.

“Alright, well let me know if you need any-“, I start to say.

“Where is she?”, he interrupts.

I look at him with my best confused expression.

“Who?”, I ask innocently.

“Madison.”, he huffs.

I try to keep my face neutral.

“I told you, I don’t know who-“

“Don’t lie to me, GIRL.”, he shouts the last word, leaning over the counter and trying to grab my apron.

I step back and start to panic.

“No one has-“

“I know she came here, or she’s still here. This is the only place she knows.”, he seethes, putting both his hands on the counter like he’s going to jump over it.

“Okay, just calm down. She was here, okay? About an hour ago, and she left. She left and headed West..”, I say, shakily pointing my hand in the general direction.

He glares at me.

I think quickly, and continue.

“She asked me not to tell anyone she was here, she gave me cash. Okay?”, I say quickly.

“Huh..”, he says, getting up and crossing across the diner to look out the window.

I can feel my heartbeat in my ears.

“Well.. if my Madison is gone..”, he begins, and I feel my shoulders begin to relax.

“Yes, she’s gone. I’m sorry-“

“Then I’ll have to take you instead.”, he says, as he turns at the counter to corner me behind it.

My heart stops.

“No, please..”, I say, beginning to inch towards the kitchen.

The man lunges at me, and I shriek, picking up a metal platter to defend myself with.

He makes it to me in about a second and snatches the platter out of my hands, the metal banging against the linoleum in a horrible sound.

I scream as he grabs my arm.

“Stop.”, a soft voice sounds from the kitchen.

We both look up to see Madison, standing in the kitchen doorway. She’s shaking, and wringing her hands, and I can see how red her eyes are.

“I’m here, I’m sorry. Take me, but leave her. She was only trying to help me.”, she whispers, looking at the man and not me.

The man looks between us for a moment, his eyes filled with fire, and hate.

Then slowly, his crude mouth forms a disgusting grin.

“Why have one, when I can have both?”, he sneers.

I pick up a metal napkin holder and whack him on the head as hard as I can, which sends him staggering back.

“Run!”, I shout as I grab Madison’s arm and we run past him around the bend in the counter.

“You.. Agh!”, he shouts as he leaps over the counter, blocking our path.

Madison and I hold each other as we back up, I’m crying and she’s staying strong, but I can feel her trembling.

“How nice Madison.. You found a friend. A first for you. Seeing how not a single person has looked for you since I took you to live with me..”, he huffs, laughing darkly.

“Please…”, she pleads.

As he backs us up away from the door, I see all my dreams start to disappear.

“I’ll never be able to help anyone..”, I whisper to myself.

Madison glances sideways at me, and squeezes my hand.

“You helped me.”, she whispers back.

I turn to look at her, and I hear a bell.

“Hey Cams, I forgot my- What the hell?”

All 3 of us turn to the door, to see Jeff standing in the doorway.

It takes Jeff a second, his eyes dart from me and Madison, to the man. 

“Cami-“, he starts.

“He’s going to take us!”, I shriek.

The man turns to face Jeff and begins to barrel towards him.

And it happens so fast.

One second, the guy has his hands outreached to Jeff’s throat.

The next, Jeff reaches into his jacket, pulling out something black, just as the man tackles him to the ground.

Madison and I are screaming when a shot rings out, echoing through the diner.

I scream in horror, as I run over to the crumpled pile of men.

“Jeff? Jeff!”, I cry out.

No one moves for a second, and then the man begins to shift.

“Oh my god.”, I whisper.

The man shifts, and falls off of Jeff, rolling onto his back. His cruel eyes, staring up at the ceiling, unblinking.

I look at Jeff, who is starting to sit up now, and throw my arms around him.

“Oh my god! I thought you were dead!”, I cry.

He’s breathing heavily, and he hugs me back quickly as I let him go and help him to his feet.

Once he’s to his full height, he takes several deep breaths and puts his hands on his hips.

“You guys okay?”, he asks.

We both nod.

“I’ll call the police..”, Madison squeaks, as she turns to the landline on the counter.

“Jeff.. what the hell was that?”, I ask in disbelief, glancing down at his gun.

“This?”, he asks, holding it up before putting it on an empty table.

“Yes, why do you have a gun?”, I ask him, not in an angry way. But.. I don’t know, how many diner employees carry guns?

“Oh..”, he says, shrugging and pointing at the gun on the table.

“Oh?”

“Well, this is Tony. Tony the gun.”, he responds matter-of-factly.

*

After the police have come and gone, I find out too much.

Jeff was okay, miraculously, he had noticed he forgot his phone and made it all the way home before he turned back around. 

Thank god he did.

As for “Tony”, the police confiscated it, which Jeff seemed okay with.

He said if he doesn’t get Tony back, he can get a new one, and he will take me to classes on how to use it. He swore it was only used tonight, but it made him feel safer wearing it.

He jumped into action so fast, I may have to rethink not asking him out.

As for Madison…

Madison had been kidnapped as a teen, and held captive in that man’s basement for 10 years.

She’s guessing, as she didn’t have access to a calendar, but she said that seemed right. The only time she got to leave the basement is when he came to get takeout, and after years, she memorized the route.

They took all three of us to the hospital, and I heard the nurses whispering about the curious injuries Madison had sustained over the years. Once I realized what they were talking about, I coughed loudly to make them stop their gossip about my friend.

I went to see Madison after I had been cleared, and I held her hand as they called her family.

She’s originally from North Carolina.

And they never stopped looking for her.
