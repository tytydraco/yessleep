I’ll admit it: I’ve always been a little soft when it comes to animals. I’m the type to brake for squirrels, slow for stray cats, and swerve for deer. Growing up, my mother used to say I was better off being around animals than people—something my wife has come to echo for the last ten years.

Can you blame me? Animals don’t have the same anger in their heart as people. They don’t have the same control over the world. Plus, they’re cute. I’ll do anything to make sure they come out safe on the other side.

Last night, that instinct nearly got me killed.

I was driving home from my parents’ place. It was late, and the stretch of highway between their town and mine was lonely—just an endless ribbon of asphalt cutting through dark woods. My headlights carved pale tunnels through the night, and the radio hummed low, a halfhearted attempt to stave off the eerie silence.

“Carry on, keep fighting,” I crooned, voice barely loud enough to be considered singing. My fingers drummed against the steering wheel. “Up with the sun, sharp as lightning.”

Then I saw it—a small, hunched shape scuttling across the road. An armadillo.

They’re like little tanks; you’d think they’d be indestructible. But I knew they ended up on the side of the road minus their heads more often than not. I jerked the wheel to the left, muttering a panicked “Jesus Christ” as the car veered onto the shoulder.

I didn’t miss.

The sound of the impact was sharp, like a rock striking metal. My heart sank as I straightened out the wheel, glancing into the rearview mirror. My heart sunk, tears already springing to the corners of my eyes. I expected to see the poor thing crumpled on the pavement.

But it wasn’t.

The armadillo was...standing. Its squat body unfurled, and for a moment, it looked almost too big, as if the impact had knocked loose some hidden, monstrous version of itself. Its head turned toward me, eyes glinting like polished marbles in the glow of my brake lights. The tears dried before they could hit my cheeks. My mouth followed suit.

Then it moved.

No. It ran.

Straight toward me.

“Shit, shit, *shit*!” I slammed on the gas, heart hammering in my chest. The car lurched forward, tires screeching. I told myself it was some kind of bizarre reflex—like chickens flapping after their heads are chopped off.

But the thing wasn’t stopping.

In the mirror, I watched it hurtle down the middle of the road, its legs moving far too fast for something its size. Its body shimmered oddly in the moonlight, shell wet and a dark stripe down the center—like it was *cracked*.

No matter how fast I went, it stayed in the mirror. Fear curdled my stomach. My fingers gripped the steering wheel so tight it turned my knuckles white.

When my speedometer hit 70, I told myself there was no way it could keep up. And yet, there it was, barreling after me with a dogged, unnatural persistence.

Dark pines blurred outside my windows. I tried to focus on the road ahead. The last thing I needed was to wrap myself around a tree because I was too busy watching a goddamn zombie armadillo. Except—it wasn’t in the rearview mirror anymore. I slowed down, just a little, Still nothing.

Relief started to push up through the fear. Was it gone? I started to slow down. There was cold sweat on the back of my neck, staining the once-crisp collar of my dress shirt.

“Thank God...”

But then there was a sound.

A *scrape*.

It came from the rear of the car, faint but unmistakable. Something sharp scraping against metal.

I barely had time to process this when something slammed against the trunk. Hard.

The car fishtailed. My knuckles turned white as I gripped the wheel, trying to keep it steady. Another *thud* followed, this one louder, closer.

The car shook violently, and suddenly, I felt the back end dip.

Weight, pulling it down. The scrape of metal—repetitive, like something *climbing*.

“No. No, no, no, no.”

I floored it, heart pounding in my ears. The car roared, and I prayed it would be enough to shake whatever the hell was back there.

No such luck.

The *skitter* of claws on metal overpowered the low tunes from the radio.

It was on the roof now.

I screamed and swerved hard to the right. The car tilted, nearly going off the road before I corrected it with another hard swerve. For a moment, everything was silent except for the rasp of my breath and the pounding of my pulse.

Then I heard it again.

Scraping. Claws dragging along the roof, slow and deliberate.

I didn’t think. I couldn’t. I just slammed the brakes.

The tires screeched, the car jolting to a violent stop. I heard a heavy *thud* as something flew off the roof and hit the pavement behind me.

I didn’t look back.

Instead, I hit the gas and sped off, not daring to check the mirror again. This time, the armadillo didn’t make it onto the car.

When I got home, I parked in my driveway and sat there, shaking, for what felt like hours. I couldn’t bring myself to let go of the steering wheel, let alone get out of the car, not until the first light of dawn started to creep over the horizon.

Even then, when I finally stepped out, I didn’t linger. My eyes kept darting to the rose bushes lining the walkway. To the dewy grass that grew tall at the base of my neighbor’s privacy fence. Had it followed me?

I didn’t think so. Not until I got to the front door. In the dirt near the cement step, there was a trail of long, thin claw marks and the faint outline of tiny, armored footprints. Something wet and dark was caked to stone.

I went inside. Called my wife—she was out of town on a business trip. Sat down here. I just want to know...has anyone else seen something like this? And do I need to be worried that the armadillo is going to keep coming back?
