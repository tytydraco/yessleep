Hi, my name is Sarah and I'm new to this whole Reddit thing. I have never really taken the internet or social media seriously and opted to live out my quiet life in the suburbs of midwestern America, taking care of my mother. To give you the same bleak greeting that all my friends and colleagues have received, the last few weeks have been hell for me. Between losing my mother and my brother, it seems like my whole world is falling apart. I know it sounds cliché, but my brother really was my best friend. Ever since he started working on farms in the Ozarks, I have seen progressively less of him.  My mother provided the only purpose in my life for a long time now. In a time where all I am doing is looking for answers, any semblance of comfort is hard to come by. But one single glinting light of hope pierced it's way through my veil of grief when I was contacted by the police last week. They told me they had made a new break in the case and I immediately offered to travel to the site if the crash. They said that there was no need and that they could send me the item in the post. I thought it odd that they would simply send a piece of evidence to me in the post but they assured me that this was more of a personal item.

I received the package yesterday and eagerly tore through the layers of packaging to reveal a small, tattered, leather notebook. What was written in that notebook was terrifying. A wildly fantastical and unbelievable story. A story of wild tribes, mythical cryptids and unexplainable phenomena. I have struggled to decide what exactly I can do with this document and a friend recommended this subreddit. I really hope someone can help. As crazy as it sounds, I think my brother may have documented his descent into insanity. The following story was written in rough, scribbled handwriting, a stark juxtaposition to the tone and pace of the writing. I guess he just wanted to get as much detail in there as possible. Any response is appreciated.

  
The following is a transcript of the contents of the notebook:

I struggled over an unwelcome clutter of oddities amassed over the months I had been away. Discarded cigarette packages, food wrappers and tools littered the floor of the combine harvester. They rattled and grazed metal against metal as the engine fired up on its first try. This was a rare occurrence. If there is one thing I have learned from years of farm labour it's not to trust old machines, especially when they have been parked up in a barn for months with obvious signs of repair. The deep crimson pine tresses of the barn gave way to a pale blue evening as I drove cautiously out of the door. A Jagged mountainous horizon behind dense wooded wilderness cast long shadows around the vehicle. I continued on morosely, trying to forget the turmoil of the past few weeks. They said I should have stayed with her, but what use was I sitting idly at a bedside? And what use was six months of hard earned savings if I immediately drained them away? I was clearly distracted by this internal conflict. That was probably why it took me so long to notice the lights. 



I angled the machine to face the sloping headland of the massive field. This would be no easy feat and I would earn every penny of my income on this job. I attached the header and aligned the fixtures of various mechanical connectives. I tested all the moving parts diligently, ensuring to calibrate the height and speed of the rotating blades. Finally, I re-entered the cab and opened the creaking sunroof to ventilate the stale air without resigning myself to an evening of pollen and dust. I revved up the combine and carefully released the clutch, proofing myself forward through the golden rows of barley. 



The familiar sight of a glinting medal calmed my nerves as I cast my eyes up to the ceiling. A small, silver pendant dangled from a twisted wire chain. It bobbed sporadically over and back. I could just about make out the Latin phrase engraved on the thin medal: "Ad Jesum per Mariam" or "To Jesus through Mary" as per its English translation. I resorted again to prayer to distract myself from the ominous monotony of the evening. I was just cresting the threshold of the furthest hill in the field when I first observed the lights. 



A collection of wavering, circular lights began to appear over the jagged mountain peaks. They seemed to be dancing around. It was not a surprise. The lights had become a sort of routine when working beside the mountain. I had spent many tiresome hours agonising over their possible source. Some sort of optical illusion is what I had settled on for the sake of my insanity. But there was a part of me that always wondered about something supernatural fluttering around those ancient Ozark mountains. I was often distracted by their mesmerising warmth. Like something familiar to a deep part of myself, detached from any discernible memory or cognitive thought. I let out a laboured wheeze caused by the pollen that hung heavy in the air and returned to my work.



It was just me and my work now. I had focus. I had a purpose. I had my composure. The first phone call came at quarter past nine. 



"How's the dew falling?" Tom let out with a guttural cough inflicted by years of incessant chain-smoking. Tom was my boss. A stern, serious man who needed to ensure I was working efficiently lest the twilight dew ruin his valuable harvest. "Not for another few hours, I'd wager". "The sun hasn't fully set". My solemn reply shattered the stillness of the cab and the quiet hum-drum of the engine. "Alright, keep on going" he said with the resignation of someone ready to end the call until another thought struck his mind. "And - uh- how's your mother now. It's no trouble if you need to get to the hospital. I can probably get someone else to-". "She's fine" I interrupted, mirroring Tom's serious demeanour. I proceeded to end the call as quickly as possible and continue with the harvesting. 



I drove in silence for another hour before the next phone call. I checked it and immediately answered with a haste and fervour I did not think I possessed until that moment. "Hello". This time, I was the one to break the silence. "Ah, finally you pick up, Conor, I've been trying to call for hours. Where are you? You know you need to keep the phone close at all times. Do you realise-". I cut her off with the statement, "I'm back in the mountains". That was becoming a habit for me. A long, arduous pause followed and the tension hung as heavy as the pollen in the dead air. "What do you mean you're back in the mountains? You have got to come back. Conor, what's wrong with you? This isn't you. You can't just leave us like that". This time, I initiated the pause. There was really nothing else to say. "Well I can and I did". "Come on Sarah, I had to get a break. I'll be back in a few days." "She might not be alive in a few days" came the blatant reply. "I'll make it back soon, OK". "I've got to go now, there's another call coming in, sorry". I hung up the call and leaned back in the old, deflating chair and rested my elbow on the loose armrests as a wound the steering around and pointed the machine away from the encroaching forest and towards the starlit horizon. There was no other caller.

  


Suddenly, a transient being dashed across my line of vision. The ethereal figure disrupted the barley, leaving stalks swaying in its wake. I reacted by serving the cumbersome machine to the side but it was inevitably useless. The figure was gone. It seemed too substantial to be a rabbit and too close to the ground to be a bird. It left too little destruction to be a deer. I shuddered in the warm evening breeze. It must have been a deer. I was tired and drowsy from the hours of driving to this field and unable to carry on. So, I swerved back into the row of barley and reversed to restore the straight line before trundling back to the edge of the field and switching off the engine. I allowed my cheat to decompress as I reclined into the seat. The hazy, orange sunset cast a dark, red glow along the forest floor and I found my exhausted body drifting into a welcome sleep. 



I awoke with a violent upward jolt, hitting my head off of the ceiling. The humidity of the cab was intoxicating and I rushed to open one of the rusty windows and alleviate my discomfort with the cool night air. But no relief came and the heat from outside was just as potent as the heat within. I swung open an unwilling door with a clatter of dusty metal and disembarked the vehicle. A miniscule glint of sunlight still illuminated the forest floor as I entered slowly and gracefully. After a brief walk, I caught sight of a clear pool of water fed from a small stream. The pine trees enclosed the area just enough to dispel any light from the edges but maintain a silver reflection on the water's surface. I saw a small pile of sticks arranged as if a fire had been lit in the past. I advanced cautiously towards the almost holy sight. 



In an instant, I froze in place with my feet rooted to the soft, pine needles of the forest floor. I was paralysed by the alien sight of an unmistakable entity. Skulking out of the shadows at the far shore, the beast emerged. It was small and appeared dark red in the waning light. My feet finally began to move and I edged closer to the water. I became so mesmerised by the creature that I disregarded the vibrating phone lodged securely in my pocket. My stiff leather boots entered the water and the figure stepped out into the moonlight, revealing its leathery skin and grotesque, demonic form. It stood on four legs and had a raggedy coat as if it was a stray dog. Two horns protruded from its head and its small, beady eyes looked on with domineering certainty. Its feline face narrowed to squint towards me. There was no question, it was an Ozark Howler. My phone ceased its vibrations as the water consumed my legs and waist. The coolness of the pond relieved my aching limbs and urged me forward into the depths to be closer with this divine creature. 



The Howler cocked its head before darting sporadically into the water with vicious intent. The water appeared to become red in colour and I marched forward, I was consumed up to my neck. The force of the Howler's uncompromising jaw bit forcefully into the flesh of my lower calf and I regained conscious thought. I began threshing frantically in an attempt to dissuade the beast from continuing its voracious attack. It felt its strong body reverberating to my meagre flailing and begin to emerge from the grimy depths of the pond. 



I retreated quickly and left the water as the Howler followed, growling and snarling from its frothy mouth. I stumbled over the remnants of the fireplace, rolling my ankle in the process. I struggled to regain my balance as the Howler advanced. I eventually stood and, fuelled by adrenaline, began to sprint through the desolate foliage of the forest. I ran in a zig-zag pattern to avoid the terror that followed behind me and I was making gradual progress to evade it. However, I was travelling further and further away from the field and the combine and any contact I could make to the outside world in the event of injury.  



After almost fifteen minutes of frantic running, I came to the realisation that I was alone. The Howler had given up pursuit and I was again isolated in the deep forest. My heart was racing and a cold sweat formed along my brow. I felt my pocket to retrieve my phone but it was empty. My trembling fingers flailed and grabbed around every fibre of cloth on my wretched body to no avail. I turned quickly to observe my surroundings but all light had drained away. I started back in the direction I had come and suddenly stopped to consolidate the action. Was that the way I had come from? I reached out to stabilise myself on a nearby tree trunk but the rotten wood fell away in my grasp and I tumbled down an unforeseen slope. 



I crashed into an exposed tree root, gnarled to a point and felt the viscous blood seep out of my neck. The stars circling my head were replaced by the cosmic constellations now visible in the sky. A red human form crept into the corner of my perception and continued briskly into the clearing. Barely visible in the twilight, the translucent being raised a slender bayonet from its heavy coat. I rubbed my eyes raw in a vain attempt to discern the details of the person, but a thick fog had set in and all my tired corneas could manage was a fuzzy rendition of the scene. Suddenly, an army of similar red figures emerged from the darkness, converging towards the lone soldier. They had no weapons, no coats, just pure valour and indignation. As if a choreographed scene from a black and white film, the men advanced towards the soldier with mock reverence. 



Before they could reach the hopeless soldier, the figure seemed to fade into the black night and disappear fully from sight. I motioned to stand and shakily managed to support myself against the tree. I felt the liquid on the back of my neck and retracted my arm to catch a glimpse of my scarlet hands. Finally, I began to walk forward, placing every foot with arduous stiffness. I glanced optimistically into the trees every few steps, scanning for a reduction in the density that would indicate the presence of the expansive field. As I did, my vision began to blur and the red-tinted plumes of displaced light shone again and I drifted into another trance. 



I persevered forward as the vegetation grew around me before parting. I saw the trees felled and the clearing of the wilderness in real time. The red figures inflicted their destructive tools onto the forested land and systematically cleared the trees. I saw them defame the native tribes and poach the buffalo from the plains. I witnessed the fury of their glistening red skin as they drove in livestock with the same vengeance they had shown every other animal and human on these plains. I saw them forcibly train dogs to protect from the wolves, both which possessed unmistakable similarities to the ethereal Ozark Howler I had encountered earlier. The humans had provided the horned evil to this situation. The figures worked together to raise barns from the felled timber. They erected the structure as a symbol of their strength. A creation wrought from all the destruction. An emblem of progress amidst the natural fallout of their surroundings. 



But I continued forward despite the revelation to get back to the combine. I perceived the awe inspiring sun rays dehydrating the timbers and the relentless rains rotting the wood in succession. I observed the structure collapse and be rebuilt by the red custodians again and again. I saw the domestication of the animals defy their ancestral creatures by rendering them docile and submissive. The dogs became weak and the slender bayonet of the soldier was refined to a shotgun which took their place. Boundaries were erected with the fervour previously reserved for the towering barn. The men divided and repositioned their priorities. More houses, more red men, more society and more complexity. Less independence, wildness and freedom. 



The ominous barn structure stood and was maintained throughout it all. It served as a church, an escape, a haven, a grain store. The long, sturdy timber poles remained strong in spite of the decades. I found a small beaded necklace on the ground. I unearthed it from soft, fertile clay and held it up to the red light. A small gleaming effigy of a suffering Jesus caught the light. I wept at the speed of progress and the digression of moral values.



Eventually, the red army divided even more and one took his tools and used them to flatten the boundaries. But the houses were flattened too and the field was restored to its barren state. Crops arose and the solitary barn rusted in the corner of the field. Production increased and the field pushed outward as the forest retreated. The field morphed and shifted but the mountains stayed the same, punctuating the distance. The crops changed and the machines changed with them. The crops grew more uniformly and taller without weeds. The machines grew in stature and reduced the space between them and the ceiling of the barn. The scene shifted one final time in a downward motion as I fell into a gaping chasm beneath my stumbling feet. 



I turned around to face the starlit sky as a rapturous sound reverberated through me. A tumultuous uproar shook my surroundings and I felt the dizziness graduate to vertigo. The scene warped with the unearthly sound that came at seemingly measured intervals. The red sky crumbled into a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours. The field, trees and distant hills bled into a singular perspective, fragmenting into a scorching light. My eyelids became hypersensitive to the light and seemed to unfurl back wider than ever. For the first time in hours, I truly saw. The sun was rising from the bottom of the slope penetrating my tired eyes. 



The sound continued in the form of my phone alarm. I grasped desperately at the ground, hopeful in the thought that it must be near. My hand slammed into the dashboard of the combine, propelling the phone onto the floor in the process. I reached down further in a daze and sifted through the miscellaneous oddities. I felt the smooth screen and instantly raised up the device, turning it on to reveal a time of 6:30. The door was ajar and unlatched, allowing a cool morning breeze to infiltrate the stuffy cab. It also left the question apparent as to whether or not I had physically left the night before. 



The phone screen lit up again with fifteen miss calls, all from the same number, Sarah. I pressed on the number and the phone rang out into the morning air. I stared blankly at the treeline as the phone rang for seven long seconds before she answered. "Hello?" came a meek and deflated greeting. "Hello, Sarah, I'm sorry. I was asleep and I only saw the calls now. So sorry. What happened? Is she alri-". This time she interrupted me. "She passed last night, Conor. You better get back here soon. I'm so sorry for your loss but I have to go now". I couldn't believe it. "Don't worry, I'm on the highway now. Just a few more hours" I lied. Yet another pause ensued. "Wait a second, Sarah? Are you alright? " "Don't worry about me, Conor. She was your mother too. You should have been there. Just get back here". The phone beeped and flatlined before I let it drop from my hand, back onto the cluttered floor.



I dismounted the machine with instinctive urgency and raced through the partially cut crop by the half-filled trailer of grain dampening in the morning dew. I was on the highway before 7 in the morning, accelerating rapidly through the sparse traffic. The road bends around gradually, adhering to the unforgiving mountainous terrain. The car engine roared as I took each corner with haste. I needed to get home. No amount of money or peace of mind was worth this. I was entirely disconnected from the situation, oblivious to my family and my grief. 



The small metal cross glinted in the morning sunlight as it hung from the mirror above the dash. I rang Tom. He was apologetic and understanding of my predicament. He told me not to worry about the field. But I did worry. I was still tied to this work, this job and this lifestyle. I couldn't mentally leave the place after what I had been through. But that thought quickly vanished as I sped up the sloping roads and raced past the overhanging vegetation. I wept silently for my mother. I had never intended for it to end like this. 



Misty specks of rain splattered gently onto the windshield. The previous night's events stayed prominent in my memory. I would never shake the thought of those men, building a colonial empire in the Ozark forest. All that stood now was the old barn. The remnants of a dying tradition. The burning embers of the frontier had died out. In all that time, I never blamed the men. I never resented them. They had a job to do just as I had mine. Did we all contribute to something greater? That is not for me to decide. At least I saved part of the harvest before the rain. The car glided along the frictionless surface. That was the first fear I had felt. I briefly but evidently lost control. I steadied my hands on the wheel and tapped on the breaks. The result was a slight drift along the smooth road. I gasped as the rain blurred my vision.



I reached down to turn on the windshield wipers and the mechanism whirred into action. The road veered sharply around a ridge but my car refused to veer with it. I floated weightlessly as propulsion forced me backward. The vehicle plummeted over the edge of the road, colliding into the cliff face moments later. The airbag expelled violently rendering me blind to the view beyond. The car was cushioned to a stop by bushes and treetops. It grinded to a halt and I pressed against the airbag, paralysed by its weight. An aching pain emanated from every bone in my body. Thick blood oozed around the white air bag. 



I averted my gaze to perceive the sky before closing my eyes and lying motionless. On the inside of my eyelids, I imagined the red workers toiling to construct a road on such a steep slope. The cross dropped down from the mirror and became submerging in my rapidly pooling blood. I cried again and prayed compulsively until I lost consciousness. The last thing I thought of before slipping into that painful slumber was the water of the starlit pond. It was so beautiful in the moonlight. It almost resembled the cracked glass that crumbled down onto my head in the crashed car.
