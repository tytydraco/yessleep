I do not have much time left, but here is what you need to know. I work for a governmental department whose name would be meaningless to most people. We're not Men in Black, but we are certainly men (and women) working round the clock on projects that would send tax-paying citizens into a dizzy.

We have no budget restrictions and no oversight beyond a handful of senior executives appointed directly by the Secretary of State. You won’t know their names because they don’t make the news. That is not an accident.

I am neither a senior nor junior staff member in my organization, but I am well-liked and very competent. When someone or something goes wrong, I am usually called in. As well as speaking Russian and German, I also have a keen interest in Cold War history. I was given a pretty simple task; review "Project Noah" and make some notes on the successes of the project.

*What's Project Noah?*

Project Noah set about building 300 bunkers between 1952-1960. These bunkers extended right down the East coast of America and were designed to save lives if a nuclear war were to occur. Our bunkers were reinforced concrete with iodine-treated paint. Each bunker was a long, vertical cylinder that extends downwards towards the earth. Each bunker could take 25 people. This meant that each bunker had a maximum capacity of 20 civilians (including necessary staff). Crucially, we placed each bunker beneath 55 meters of soil and dirt. 

So, what was I reviewing exactly? Well, each bunker had a point caller, and each point caller had their own diaries. The bunker notes were the usual maintenance checks, routine training or on the rare occasion, an intruder found them. The point caller is best summarized via the handbook below:

A point caller is someone who, via their connections in the White House (WH), gets direct and immediate information about potential nuclear strikes on America. Their role involves making the call to the surrounding ticket holders of the bunker. Their call sounds the alarm that nuclear war is imminent, and all residents of the bunker must make immediate efforts to travel to the bunker. The call was known as the Doomsday Trumpet (See Revelation 9:1). The Bureau Executive directly appoints the point caller.

Now, in retrospect, we are thankful, very thankful, that nuclear war did not occur. As a result, most point callers summarized their experiences as tense, but they never needed to pull the trigger on imminent nuclear war. Overall, war and violence never erupted on the East Coast of America, although we had some close moments.

I was to catalogue and review the notes for any added details that we might be able to gain from the diaries. I reviewed 299 pointer caller diaries. What struck me was this. Between Bunker 256 and 258, there should have been a diary entry from Bunker 257. We were missing a diary from the point caller of B.257. I was confused, but I did know this; when you work on projects, it's best to keep questions to yourself and find the answers first. 

All too often, you get the grey suit wall of intentional confusion, obstruction, and sometimes outright misinformation. It took me many hours in the depths of the Bureau's archive, but I was able to find a diary. Most of the diary appears ripped out, but there is some left.

What proceeds is the last known details of Bunker 257.

**-DIARY ENTRY #2-**

"In 1962, the nation made a major decision. We, the people, confronted Communism. We confronted tyranny. We confronted the Iron Curtain. On a more personal level, we sounded the alarm in southern Florida that a nuclear war was imminent. While the beatniks moseyed around to free love, or whatever they called it, we prepped for the possibility of WWIII. Protocol had been in place for quite some time, but nothing can take away from the reality of war. You can plan as much as you like, but when you're staring nuclear weapons in the face, it's a whole different ballgame. You cannot sing your way out of fallout.

Originally, I wanted OSS, but like many others, I was sent to the shores. Actually, I was sent flying into German-occupied France somewhere around Sainte-Mère-Eglise. Unlike many others, I made it back. At the conclusion of the war, I and the entire world became cognizant of the existence of nuclear weapons. I joined the INR (the Bureau to you) in 61'. Hilsman interviewed me personallu. I quickly rose up the ranks, and with the help of some old friends, I was able to position myself as a point caller. From lowly George Sobel to First Lieutenant Sobel.

If the WH gets the nod, we get the nod. Simple as that. We're direct to the source. If you're telling people that they are about to be vaporised 25 minutes after the bombs have dropped, you've failed. Knowing full well the Reds had the Царь-бомба, we made a decision that across the East coast, bunkers would be built and sold to the highest bidders. 

Call it an insurance program if you prefer, but we were basically selling a future to families with who could afford a future worth preserving. The call would come through a dedicated phone that each family had. They would have also purchased their tickets well in advance. They looked like the C-ration cans that got Ike got us in 41'.

Cynically, these were not the best and brightest of America either. Most were finance, business, and property millionaires who managed to make some decent money during the War. If I had my way, veterans would have been first in line, but that was well above my pay grade at the Bureau.

If you were a senior employee and worked on the crucial maintenance, provided high-level intelligence, or were on the committee, then you were assigned a room. As a result, I had a bunker room. I'm not married, have no direct family members, and no real life outside my job. As point caller, I lived beside Bunker 257, and I operated a basic job through my home. This all allowed me to fit in easily with the neighbours, albeit I was known to be shy. Importantly, it also allowed me to be ready to move at the drop of a hat. I fit the bill as point caller of B. 257. 

Antsville could worry about themselves because we were made in the shade.

Then, it happened. On that fateful day, after getting the call to make the call, I made the call. 

I got a call from Shortmouth (my contact in the WH), and he made it clear. The Soviet's nukes were launched by state-of-the-art submarines and not from the mainland. With that, we had even less time than I thought. When I made the call, it wasn't long before a convoy of cars, not the Impalas, Lincolns, and Fords I expected, but beat up greasers, came spinning down the dirt road, only to be abandoned as if they were already radioactive. The bunker door is modest in size and meant to blend with the natural scenery. If you don't know where it is, the likelihood of finding it by accident is rare. We have a clear policy for any man left behind. If you were not present and accounted for within 35 minutes, we shut the bunker doors. Isn’t that a bite? Still, that's about 8 minutes more than I would have liked. Don't believe me? You should go and ask Herb York.

This is where I made my first and only error. In my haste, I did not set the lockdown time for the mandatory 9-day cooldown, but rather 9 years. I swear I had 9 days in place originally.

Yes.

I know.

I was certain that I did it right, but I was also unable to override the timer because my second-in-command, Second Lieutenant James Winters did not make to the bunker in time. Lucky him. Here's the gut punch: we are truly silos. When the Bureau explained this, they made the point that the risk of cross contamination was too high. All it took was a single commie or dissident to uproot the bunkers, and the whole program would have got the royal shaft. I understood this at the time, and when explained, I stupidly agreed. 

My fear of the Reds overpowered my common sense.

We did have a radio. It's been almost 8 days since JFK and Khrushchev talked each other down from the brink of war. Cuba's waters had calmed, and America, the Soviets, and the entire world unclenched their fists. If anything, there was celebration above ground. I am grateful; truly, I am. Part of me selfishly prayed that war would occur. I would have justified my actions by my incredible foresight, but as we crowded around the only radio in the bunker, I imagined our president proudly addressing the nation from the Oval Office, I briefly smiled.

I watched families pack their bags, move themselves towards the exit, and stare at the countdown timer for the reinforced bunker doors to open. While there was laughter, pats on the backs, and a few light-hearted jokes about a mandated vacation, they were worn and weary. I was still in my office, which overlooked the bunker door and entrance hall.

The timer ticks to 0, and the doors do not budge; a new timer flashes up. 9 years. Well, 9 years minus 9 days. Smiles and laughter turned to shouts and screams. The Radio was futile. No one was answering, no matter the constant shouting and screaming. All radio waves were silent. There is a short staircase leading to my office. On the staircase, I placed furniture between them and me. Futile, but it gave me a small sense of control over the situation. The door is locked. I won’t be able to tell you the rest of this story as I hear the rush of bodies towards my staircase. While I know that we do not have food for everyone here, I have just enough ammunition for the first few. Call me Bogart, but this is now me vs. them.

In 1956, Khrushchev's "Мы вас похороним" was ingrained into the psyche of the American mind. As I hear their bodies bounce against the office door, I can't help but think that in the end, I did all the work for him.

**-END OF DIARY ENTRY #2-**

I was aghast. Not only were 25 people condemned, but his diary was clearly found, catalogued, and reviewed. Why then would someone be so eager to deny the families and friends this closure? As I placed the document back onto the shelf an abrupt cough notified me to another presence.

*"B.257, is it?"*

I gazed at an elderly man in his 90s. He was not in uniform, but I gave the salute in confidence that he was at one point. He returned the salute. I nearly forgot to answer him.

*"Yes, it appears so. B. 257. How is this not been brought into public disclosure?"*

He smiled.

*"Well, we don't make mistakes here. I perhaps owe my life to that man”.*

He walked slowly over and thumbed the back of the binder. He leafed through the pages landing on Winters.

*"I have to explain. First Lieutenant Winters was not a bad guy by any means. In fact, he was a lot better than I was. That's probably the reason they picked him and not me."*

I was puzzled.

*"The families. Known Soviet agents. Known communist sympathizers. Known peaceniks. Look. They were a lot more trouble than you would have thought. They weren't billionaires or millionaires as we had Sobel believe. They were union workers, factory leaders, and in some cases budding revolutionaries. Funny, you would think they would be more discerning, but when liquidation is your only other option, the government is your best friend.* 

*You don't really believe that the 9 day or 9 year or whatever you set it at cannot be overruled, do you? That would be a bit of an oversight, and guess what? We have a lot of oversight."*

I was still trying to parse more information out of this disarmingly forthright man.

*"How do you know all this?"*

*"I know this because I wasn't late. I never intended on showing up. Look son, you try to get the Kennedys or the Johnsons or whoever to sign off on 25 people? Some of them were pretty high up as well. That's just not going to happen, is it? We needed a place for them, we needed it fast, and we needed it during a time of crisis. When the whole world is looking left, we're going right."*

It dawned on me.

*Second Lieutenant Winters?*

*"That's Major to you, son."*

With that he gave a wry wink.

I wave of shock and anger swept over me. For almost 80 years, these people were sentenced to a bunker without a cause. Winters told me that the Bureau never made mistakes, well they might have done when the hired me.

*“Look, here’s the deal”*

He sighed

*“Food was meant to run out after 25 years. If I can do the math, so can you. Last month we received a message"*

*“How?”*

*“Well, when we went to review all the bunkers, we reopened communication with each one. Obviously, most of them were empty, so nothing too surprising, but a few volunteers back in 1980 said they would do a stint. See how well the bunkers held up.”*

*“We left Bunker 258 alone because frankly, it’s already a grave. For a good 25-30 years, nothing, and then boom.”*

He snapped his fingers.

*“Three words followed by three more.”*

**Not. Alone. Anymore.**

**Send. Help. Priest.**

I was puzzled.

Major Winters’ eyes darkened.

*“Another thing.”*

*"Whatever is down there. It's big. We don't know much, but any attempt to make contact has sent our own men into a headspin. We have three off-duty from PTSD just by listening to the radio. Honestly? We have no idea what's down there. The doors have been internally reset to open. Whoever is in there wants to get out.”*

I knew the next question.

*“Will you go, Norm?”*

And with that, I went forward to see who or what was still alive in Bunker 257.
