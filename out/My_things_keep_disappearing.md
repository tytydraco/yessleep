About three years ago I finally bought a house. Huge achievement (for me at least) 
And I was so proud of myself. I had graduated collage with a bachelors in electrical engineering, had gotten a nice paying job at a place that designs microcontrollers for everyday hobbyists. 

My house wasn’t huge, nor was it in the biggest part of town, but it was still a decent house. 3 room, 1 bathroom (with a nice shower), 1 huge walk in closet (though I never filled it). It was a nice house.

About a year ago things started to go missing. At first it was my coffee cups, then food. It was never enough for me to be worried, I am an incredibly unfocused person, and have lost my wallet on multiple occasions. It was never anything major, but it was definitely a bit annoying. However it got worse when my front door began to unlock itself.

There were multiple occasions when  I would close my door and lock it behind me, only for me to come back home, and it be completely unlocked, sometimes even slightly ajar. Again, I chalked it up to my scatterbrain, but it was still a little odd. Eventually I realized that the little metal nub, the part that keeps the door locked and closed was gone. It was just not there. It spooked me, I talked to the police (there had been break ins near me before), but since nothing could be confirmed stolen, and there was no evidence of any actual person, and there was no actual sign of a break in (no broken parts, nothing definitive) they couldn’t really do much. They told me to buy  something like a ring camera if I’m still spooked, so I did.

It had been a year, nothing had happened, nothing had seemed to go missing. I got a girlfriend finally! We had been dating for about 8 months, when she came over to my house to watch this new show with me. We were about 2 episodes in when I really had to go use the bathroom. When I came back, she was completely gone. Her car was in the driveway, I saw it out the window, but she was not there. I called her phone, but she didn’t pick up. The bowl of popcorn she was eating was gone. The pillow she was holding was gone. I was really worried, so I went to go outside when I realized the handle to my door handles were gone.

I was looking for my phone, but it, and my wallet where both no where to be seen, even though they where in my pocket only moments ago. I ran to the neighbors, I thought was losing it. I called her number on there phone, and then the polices. The police thought that it was a break in, and were worried that my girlfriend was in danger, and then I remembered my doorbell camera. Because I had no phone, I to log into my account, but my email account would not work. My phone number didn’t exist. The police were unable to do anything, seeing as there was absolutely no evidence. There was no reselling of my items on anything like eBay, no scratch or damage to the house, no finger prints, nothing. 

Work was worse. I came in and my desk was empty. My boss told me my position, and all my employment contracts don’t exist, and he thinks I’m just trying to get a job. He doesn’t know me. I had worked there for 4 whole years, right out of college. I contacted my college, since they had helped me get the job with a workforce thing, and they said I have no records of ever being there. I went home.

My whole house was gone. The plot of land it sat on is gone. My car was gone. It’s been like this for weeks. I have no accounts. No money. My parents don’t remember me. Do you know how much it hurts for your own mother to tell you she doesn’t have a son? That she’s never had a son? To hear your dad tell you to “quit messing around boy, you’re scaring my wife”?

About a month ago my clothes disappeared. I’m hiding in this guys house right now, I’ve stolen his clothes, and messed with his lock so he can’t hear me come and leave his house. I’ve stolen his phone. About an hour ago my left hand disappeared.
