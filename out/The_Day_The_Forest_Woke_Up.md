I had never felt the need to use the word *cacophony* before. Never, not even once in my life. Until I decided to explore the woods near our new house, that is. That evening was when everything in my life changed. I have never told anyone outside my immediate family about this before. After all, they didn't believe me, so why would anyone else? Now is as good a time as any to share.

Our new place was way out in the boonies, and that’s no exaggeration. Our closest neighbor was an hour’s drive away, if you ignored the few speed limit signs that existed on the lonely road that wound between the two properties. The house itself was nice, but I was in no mood to appreciate it on that first day.

I spent a few hours unpacking and ignoring my parents, in equal amounts, until I decided to sneak away for a bit to check out the woods. There were almost no manmade paths in the forest that dominated a good three quarters of our land, although there were quite a few faint game trails that meandered past the darkened boughs. Before we moved, I had always felt at home outdoors, comfortable, even. The forest here, however, seemed strange and foreboding, completely different from what I was used to. Even the trees had a menacing feel to them.

They seemed to absorb any sunlight that managed to slip past the thick canopy above. It was only four in the afternoon and yet within the trees, it was already hard to see more than a few yards away. I stayed near the edge of the trees at first, curious but hesitant to venture deeper. Even then, I had good instincts. If only I had listened to them.

I had nearly decided to turn back and run home when I saw something in the underbrush, near the foot of a particularly large tree. As it was only a few feet away from the game trail I had been following for the past hour or so, I didn’t think there was much harm in investigating. I walked over slowly, the sound of my boots crushing dead leaves underfoot loud in my ears. I curiously crouched down and brushed aside some leaves and twigs to find a strange black stone.

As I began to examine it, the forest suddenly exploded around me. A wall of noise assaulted my ears as what seemed like all the birds in the forest suddenly started calling and screeching, beating their wings and causing leaves to fall in a flurry around me. Without thinking I slipped the mysterious stone into my pocket and ran back the way I came, forsaking the trail I had been following entirely. I ran in the general direction of the house, desperate to escape my avian pursuers. I was in stitches and nearly hysterical when the sound finally died out abruptly.

I looked around for the first time since beginning my headlong sprint, and realized that I was near the edge of a  stream. I hadn't even been aware that there *was* a stream on our property. Worse, the light was now beginning to fade in earnest as true darkness approached. I had not thought to bring a flashlight, and had only my phone, which had only about 20 percent battery left. A quick check revealed that I also had no cell service out here.

Despite this, I nearly cried with relief when the birds finally stopped, until I realized that while the birds had stopped chattering around me, all the other sounds one can expect to find in a forest also died out. It was entirely, completely, absolutely silent. The words “calm before the storm” came to mind, unbidden. In that moment, every hair on my body suddenly stood on end, and I knew without a shadow of a doubt that I was being watched.

I had no clue by who, or even by what, but I knew that it was time to leave. I ignored my protesting muscles and made my way as fast as I could away from the stream. I couldn't escape the sinking feeling that there was something out there, just out of eyesight. I was tempted to start running again, but something stopped me, something born out of pure, animal instinct.

And so I continued, moving as fast as I dared through the underbrush. Before long, I mercifully began to recognize the area, noticing a rotting log that I had passed earlier in the day. This time, however, the fading light revealed something I had not seen before; long, ragged gashes in the trunk, evenly spaced and deeply carved into the dead bark. They were unmistakably claw marks. I tried to keep my breathing even as I sped up slightly, fighting off panic.

I struggled forward, thinking that I was surely going to die that night. I could barely see through the trees, but I managed, somehow, to find my way back to the path I had been following before everything went to hell. I hurried forward and, as soon as I stepped back on the path, it was as if I stepped into another world, as if a pressure had lifted. Instinct warned me not to let my guard down, though, and I continued forward, following the trail as closely as I could in the light of my dying cell phone. Suddenly I heard a branch snap to my right, and heard a long, low growl coming from the darkness.

Objectively, it was a beautiful thing. For nearly thirty seconds, I was frozen in place as I listened to a blistering, hackle-raising tirade, looking through the trees in morbid curiosity as I searched for the source of the noise. As I looked around, I noticed a pair of glowing red eyes floating just below eye level. It was at that moment that I decided I was absolutely not interested in finding out what those eyes belonged to.

I tore down the path in a dead sprint, hoping to put as much distance as possible between myself and the thing that was, it seemed, not pursuing me for the moment. Or so I thought. “The bastard gave me a head start.” I thought to myself as I began to hear the sounds of pursuit. It was obvious that whatever it was was quite large; I could hear the sound of its pounding footfalls tearing through the flora behind me as I did my best to make it back to the relative safety of the clearing beyond the forest. I continued, pounding down the path until I made it back to the edge of the trees, the clearing beyond visible in the moonlight.

Just as I was about to break through the tree line, I felt a searing, burning pain, as if my back was on fire or being touched by a hot iron. I stumbled, but managed to only just barely keep my footing, moving forward and away from the forest as quickly as I could. I made it about two hundred yards before I stumbled again. I was unable to keep my footing this time, and landed on my hands and knees before sitting heavily.

I gazed back at the trees, fully expecting some monster with red eyes to come barreling through the trees to finish me off. I saw nothing. I heard nothing. Where I expected there to be a bulldozer sized hole in the trees and underbrush, there was absolutely nothing. As if there had been no disturbance whatsoever. I sat there, dumbstruck and in shock, until the adrenaline began fading.

Then, I felt a breeze rush over my bare back. I fearfully reached around and found that my shirt was torn to shreds and, worse, soaked in blood. In that moment the pain of the wound finally hit me in its entirety.

The pain was excruciating. It dragged a pained groan from my lips and tears from my eyes as I fell, no longer able to even sit up. Small rocks hidden beneath the grass dug into my skin as lights began to appear around me, and I thought that surely I must be about to die. But, instead of the expected friends and family, I began to see the faces of strangers all around me. In my delirium, I could only wonder if that meant I wasn’t going to heaven.

The last thing I saw before my eyesight faded was my mother, sobbing joyfully as she reached out to me.
