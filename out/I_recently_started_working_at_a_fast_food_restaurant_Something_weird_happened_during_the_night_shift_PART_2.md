The next morning I looked like total *shit* \- which made sense since I hadn't slept a wink. I'd sent Pitty a text (he gave me his number back during our first smoke sesh) around 6:00am.

*"Call me when you're up."*

It was now 9:09 and he still hadn't rung. So I tried his cell.

"Yeah?" Pitty grumbled, still half asleep.

"Hey. It's Matt. From... Happy Burger?"

"I'm sleeping, dude."

*Must be nice*, I thought to myself.

"Listen, sorry to call so early, but... did you, by chance, happen to see anything weird last night? Like, at your apartment?"

"Yeah. My dog diarrhea'd all over my floor. I'd say that was pretty weird."

Even though I'd just met Pitty, I'll admit his sense of humor was pretty endearing. But *now* was not the time for jokes about dogs pissing water.

"I'm serious, man. When I got home from work I heard... like, someone *laughing*. And then I went into the other room and I... I saw him again. In the reflection of my TV. Standing right fucking behind me. But when I turned around, no one was there."

"Wait. You saw *who?"*

I sighed and said one word in a low whisper: "Happy."

It was quiet on the line for a while.

"Hello? Pitty?"

"I'm going back to sleep, bro. I'll call you later."

And he hung up.

\*\*\*

Even though my shift wasn't until 8 that night, I decided to pay Happy Burger a visit later that morning once they were open for breakfast (apparently their egg burritos were absolutely terrible, by the way).

When I entered through the back office, Rick was hunched over at his desk and staring out into space like a zombie. Apparently I wasn't the only one who wasn't sleeping. I knocked on the door to emphasize my arrival and he snapped out of his stupor.

"Matt," he mumbled. "You're not working today."

"Hey, Rick. Yeah, I know, but uh, do you think I could talk to you for a sec?"

He nodded while I took a moment to strategize. Obviously, I couldn't just come right out and tell my boss that some weird, demon-mascot-clown in his restaurant followed me home and terrorized me last night.

No, I had to think smarter.

"So that guy, Jorge, who used to work the night shift? Well, he, uh, left some of his CDs in the back. I took them home last night so they wouldn't get stolen. I was wondering if I could get his contact info to return them?"

*Shit!* I immediately thought to myself. *Why did I say CDs? People don't even use those anymore!*

Rick was going to know I was lying. He stared at me, hard, for a long while. He seemed... *angered* by my question.

"That's confidential, employer-privileged information."

"Right. I know. It's just–"

"And I really gotta get back to work."

Work? The dude was literally just sitting at his desk, doing nothing.

I figured I should press once more. "But the CDs–"

"You can give them to me. I'll take care of it."

Motherfucker.

"Okay. Sure. Later, Rick."

I forced a smile and left.

\*\*\*

That night, I stayed quiet during my dreaded shift and let Pitty do most of the talking. A few teenagers came in for milkshakes early on, followed by some bodybuilder dude wearing a cutoff t-shirt who downed four double cheeseburgers (lettuce wrap-style) like it was fucking child's play.

Gym rats, man.

After that guy ate half our supply of cooked meat, I headed to the walk-in freezer in the back to grab some more frozen patties.

When I opened it up, cold air flowed out like fog. I left the door propped open while I walked inside, and that's when–

"No! Shit!"

I turned back and saw the door slam shut behind me. I grabbed the handle, but it wouldn't open. I banged on the door hard with my fist.

"Pitty! Open up! I'm locked in, man!"

I tried to stay calm. I'm not gonna lie, it was definitely pretty claustrophobic in there, but it wasn't like I was gonna *die* from the cold or anything. Sooner or later, he'd let me out. Right?

I blew my breath into my hands trying to warm up a bit–

And that's when it started.

First, the lights inside the freezer started flickering.

Off and on.

Then, I heard that awful sound again.

Hysterical laughing.

It simultaneously sounded like Happy was *in* my ear - but also... all around me, *everywhere*.

"PITTY! OPEN THE DOOR!" I screamed.

*Shit,* I realied. *What if he's taking a dump again?*

Not soon after that thought went through my brain, I felt something behind me.

Almost like... a presence, if you wanna call it that.

I didn't want to turn around.

I was scared shitless.

Finally, the lights went out completely, leaving me alone in the cold, dark room.

At first, all I could hear was the sound of my own voice, hyperventilating.

Then, I heard him.

*"How can I make you happy, Matt?"*

A shiver ran down my spine.

It was that fucking clown.

I whipped around, but it was still too dark to see anything.

"Fuck you! Leave me alone!" is all I could scream.

I backed myself into the corner, my shoulder blades against the door now. And as my eyes adjusted to the dark, I saw something that will haunt me until the end of my days.

A shadowy figure was crawling towards me on all fours.

"Please! Stop!"

It got closer and closer until that recognizable face came into view.

White paint. Black eyes. Red, rubber nose. And curly hair, dyed a sickly shade of green, like vomit.

Happy put his horrible face up to mine. He was so close that I could smell his rancid breath.

*"Don't be sad,"* he said. *"You're at Happy Burger!"*

I almost pissed myself as Happy began to smile and his cheeks grew wider and wider, almost like a never-ending grin that seem to go on for eternity.

His face took an unnatural shape as it continued to stretch out and drool leaked out of his mouth and onto the floor of the freezer.

I closed my eyes because I couldn't stand the sight anymore.

And that's when the freezer door finally opened.

It was Pitty. I immediately looked up to find him standing there, just staring at me casually as I writhed around on the floor.

Of course, Happy was gone. And I looked fucking insane.

"Matt? Are you okay, man?"

At first, I couldn't speak. I was still in shock.

"No," I finally said. "I'm not."

\*\*\*

"Bro, you seriously need to calm down," Pitty told me at the register. "Why don't you take one of my gummies and–"

"I don't want your fucking gummies!" I yelled at him. "Can't you see there's something seriously wrong here?!"

"Look, I'm not saying I don't believe you, it's just... hard when I haven't seen it myself, you know?"

I breathed. Tried to think. It made me angry that he didn't understand how truly fucked the situation was. But then I remembered Pitty was a harmless stoner and his dumbness mainly stemmed from the fact that he was high 24/7.

"Listen," I started. "Something... is happening. It got to Jorge and now it wants me. When was the last time you talked to him?"

"Well, I dunno. He stopped responding to my texts after he quit. Like, ghosted."

"Do you have his address?"

"Yeah. We hung out at his place once before work. Played some video games and shit."

"Text it to me. I'm gonna drive over there," I said, pulling my keys outta my pocket.

"Right now?" asked Pitty. "But you're on the clock."

"So cover for me," I suggested. "It's not like anyone else is gonna come in tonight anyway."

\*\*\*

I drove across town, no music on the radio, no podcast, nothing. Sometimes, shit is so serious that you require absolute silence.

My GPS told me that I was approximately five minutes away from Jorge's place when I noticed the car behind me had been following for some time now.

Of course, my paranoid ass got suspicious. But then I figured I was just on edge still from the freezer incident.

However, my worst fears were confirmed when the car ended up following me all the way to the address - a shit ass apartment building across town.

The moment I parked, *they* parked.

The moment I opened my door, *they* opened theirs.

I held my breath, waiting to see who was tailing me...

And as the dude headed towards me in the dark, I realized... it was my boss.

"Matt!"

Rick stormed across the pavement and headed straight for me.

"Rick? What the hell are you doing here?"

He got right in my face and pointed a finger. "Don't worry about *me.* You're the one trying to stalk my ex-employee."

"What? No, I just– Sorry, back up. Why did you follow me in the middle of the night–"

"If you don't leave here right now, you'll lose a lot more than just this job. I promise you that." Rick gripped my arm tightly as he said this, looking into my eyes.

"Is that a threat?"

He let me go. "Of course not."

I can't exactly explain it, but in that moment, a few things became clear to me. The first was that Rick was capable of doing very bad things. The second was that he was willing to do so because *he* was terrified of Happy, too. Just like me.

"You're on the clock, Matt" he gestured at my uniform. "Give me one good reason why I shouldn't fire you right now."

*Because I'm barely making my rent and I literally need this job to survive,* I thought to myself.

"I'm sorry. I'll go back now."

"Good," he said.

Rick stood there and watched me as I got back in my car and drove back to the restaurant.

I was now more confused and scared than ever, but I knew one thing for sure: this guy *really* didn't want me to talk to Jorge.
