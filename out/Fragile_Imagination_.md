Getting around to telling a story that happened to me, and has always sat and dwelled in the back of my mind. Always wondering if it was a figment of my young, fragile imagination, or if I had truly stumbled upon something more sinister?

During my adolescence, I wasn't particularly the most fortunate, but I would make the most of every situation. My mother would work extremely long and grueling hours at our local supermarket to make sure that my brother and I had everything we needed—food, clothes, and the essentials. While my disabled father would try his hardest to make my life, as well as my mother's and brother's lives, a living embodiment of chaos. On the opposite end of the wage gap, my grandparents were very well off. Any opportunity we had, my brother and I would go over to enjoy the good snacks, television, and their ever-so-comforting presence. It also gave my mom a much-needed rest from having to raise her two sons alone while constantly being berated and ridiculed by a man who never deserved her time, let alone whether he even wanted her or us to begin with. 

I grew up in a predominantly small town, but my grandparents, who lived about thirty minutes away, lived in an even smaller town. One main road connected the towns, as if that road were the towns’ heartbeat. They lived in the back of town, heading towards the sticks. As an adult, you can find peace and tranquility in the silence the night brings in a town like that. As a child, though, it always left me with a lingering feeling of dread when nighttime came. 

They would always pick us up early in the morning, early enough to get breakfast from McDonald's so we could eat in the car as we drove our way a few towns over. We took the main road off to climb our way up the hill where the house, as well as the property, resided. Although mostly burnt up by the sun, the land itself always brought me some sort of internal peace, as if when the gates opened and closed it was a safe spot for me. We had set our things down and begun to get our blankets, clothes, and whatnot all set up for the weekend. The day continued like any other, with a house filled with laughter, mischief from me and my brother, and plenty of cartoons. 

The night had finally begun to peer its head over the house on the hill, watching the orange, blue, and pink sky slowly being swallowed by the stars and the moon from on the porch. At the time, my brother would sleep on the pullout bed that we had in the living room, and every time we would stay the night, my grandfather would sleep in his recliner, as if he were watching us sleep, like a wolf to its cubs, protecting them through the night. They deemed me old enough to sleep in the empty guest bedroom, and I was thrilled to say the least. A kid with his snacks and TV to watch as much as he wanted. What was there to hate about it? 

I always had a vivid imagination when I was young. Turning a space that would be considered by most as empty and devoid of existence into a lively picture that was painted in my own head. Always thinking, always imagining, always dreaming. But I am confident that what I saw was not a dream, but instead a glimpse of hell peeking around the corner. Taunting me.

While I stirred in the middle of the night, at some point my mind finally drifted and lulled me to sleep. I woke up with a pit in my stomach. Without hesitation, I sat up, as if the undisclosed tension in the air was enough to shake me to my core. I got out of bed and opened my door to an empty home—not empty in the sense of furniture and belongings, but empty and void of the soul and life that had filled the house the day before.

Determined to uncover what was happening, I meandered through the house, discreetly checking every door, room, and couch, but I found no one. As I made my way to the kitchen, that pit in my stomach unfortunately became validated. The back door in the kitchen that led to the washer and dryer was ajar. I remembered being told as a child that I wasn't raised in a barn, knowing full well anyone that left a door opened, especially an door to the outside would get an ear full. It had immediately set off alarms in my head. Creeping my way over to the door, I could hear a breeze. As I entered through the door, my fear reached its climax. The door to the laundry room was also wide open, leading to the carport that still contained my grandpa's beloved van. The door to the outside is one of those air-hydraulic ones; when pushed open, it would close on its own unless the metal piece connected to it was pulled, preventing it from doing so. The piece had been moved. Utterly petrified, I took a step outside, surveying my surroundings. But the only thing my mind could retain was the sight of one of my grandfather's crocs lying there before I was dragged back into the clutches of reality. Or so I thought.

I can recall what happened next with crystal clarity; there are no changes in the stories. rhythm, down to the last word. My eyes shot open, glued to the ceiling as I almost audibly let out a sigh of relief, knowing it was all a dream. I rolled over onto my side to readjust and get cozy when my whole perception of life as a child shifted. There he was, standing in the open doorway, gazing at me with a sickening and sardonic smile, as if he were mocking me. I was petrified and vulnerable, only able to stare daggers back at him. Rather than looking grotesque and disfigured, he had the appearance of the uncanny valley. A man I saw as a protector and father figure was cast in a cloud of hate. He—it—looked just like him: his goatee, his stance, his bald head with a few dangling hairs begging to be cut. But it was his eyes that told the story. That was not my grandfather.

Now, almost in a trance, I was unable to move. The fear coursing through my being like a disease flowed its way through my body, no, my soul. I was never able to speak to it, to interact with it. He only smiled, he only smiled at me. Almost coming to terms with my fate, I awoke.

I awoke to my grandmother at the foot of my bed, looking concerned. Of course, my initial reaction was to cringe backward, fearing she had also come for me. "Honey Bunches, are you okay?" "You gave us quite the scare with all of that screaming," she said softly, understanding full well that something had happened. I sat up, rubbing my eyes. "Yeah, Mamaw, I'm okay. It was just a bad dream, but I'm better now." She guided me into the kitchen to eat with my brother and grandpa. We had our usual small morning talk, me finding it hard to... let the love that was in that room lift my spirits. As Grandma and my brother walked toward the living room to put on cartoons, my grandpa stopped me before I could follow. "Hey, buddy, did you, by chance, go out last night and leave the doors open?" "It's okay if you did, but please close them next time; you weren't raised in a barn, after all." Chuckling off a statement that meant nothing to him but brought hell down on me. Only able to agree with what he said and apologize, out of fear and confusion, I didn't tell him. Wanting to believe it was truly just a figment of my imagination, I finally made my way to the living room, being greeted by my family. As he followed me in, he told us all that he would be doing some yard work and if we needed anything, we could run out and get him. Hearing his socks shuffle along the tile as he headed  to the back, he raised his voice to get my... grandmother's attention from the back of the house. "Hey, honey, where did you put my shoes?"
