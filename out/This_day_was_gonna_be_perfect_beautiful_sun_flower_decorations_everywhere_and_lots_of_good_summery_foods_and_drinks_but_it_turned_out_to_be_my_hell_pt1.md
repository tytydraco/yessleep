The story I’m going to tell is the must traumatic experience of my life, and I know it’s not over and I'm here to warn people.

The summer of 2021 started great, I moved to the most perfect place with my parents, a small town with beautiful gardens and big green trees everywhere, I made lots of new friends and we had the best weather in ages, considering we live in Norway it wasn't often we had so much sun in the summers. And at midsummer we where planing for a big feast and have a campfire with the neighborhood when the sun was at the lowest. But around 07.30 pm some of the neighbors started going home, or at least that's what we thought.

Around 09.00 pm we were around 15 people, but we stared out with around 25, it was like the others had disappeared form the place, first there was only 4 or 5 people and in all the dancing and talking we didn't think much about it, but 10 people going home before the campfire? Everyone was so exited for this day so it didn't really make sense for so many people to go home so early..

I was with my friends Elisabeth and Olivia but Elisabeth wasn't around after me and Olivia had went to go get more lemonade and that was when I noticed all the others that wasn't there, I started getting a weird feeling that something was wrong, she would never leave without saying goodbye to us.. Olivia didn't understand anything either and looked at me blankly asking if we could have said anything to make her leave,

No I don't think so, I answered

We should ask someone if they saw her leave, Olivia said

We asked everyone around the park, but no-one knew where she had gone. She didn't answer any of our messages or calls, so we started getting worried something had happened. After awhile we got a massage from an unknown number "What is it?" and before I could write back they called, 

Maybe she's using her house phone? Olivia said, so I answered. A weird, fast breathing was on the other side of the line, like she had been running, Elisabeth? Is that you? Why did you leave? I asked, the call cut and a loud siren started, everyone looked shocked and pail. I felt like my body was drawn backwards and my vision started getting weak.. The last thing I remember seeing was everyones scared and weirdly distorted faces looking at me, and the siren getting louder and louder until everything went black and I fell to the ground.

When I woke up I was in the woods, laying there in different clean white linen clothes and when I sat up I saw I was outlined on the ground around with the most vibrant flowers I've ever seen.

Dont be scared, a voice said behind me, the only thing I could think about when she said that was that she sounded an awful lot like me.. "You are beautiful, clean." She said.. I couldn't move, I was just sitting there. "Who.. Who are you?" I stuttered, I heard a big sight like she expected me to know her or something, "Cant you remember your own voice?" she snapped at me, "I'm like you.. not exactly you, but we are the same" I heard steps getting closer from behind me, "This must be a dream" I whispered to myself closing my eyes as tight as I could,

OPEN THEM! she screamed at me, I could feel her breath on my face.. OPEN THEM!, my eyes shut open.. It was me, but the hair had blood all over it dripping down on her white clothes and face, her eyes where two different colors, I have light blue eyes, she had one eye with the lightest green and the other was a dark brown almost black.. I looked at her shocked

"Dont you remember me?" she said in a calm almost sad voice, I hesitated answering.. "N.. No I don't" I stuttered again. She frowned, "Well I remember you, and I've missed you", she crouched in front of me in an animalistic way. She made a click sound with her mouth and I heard screaming, everywhere. Louder and louder, I couldn't feel or see anything, it was like being in a void of nothing except screams.. And a then again click.. it was gone, she smiled wide, I felt like her face was going to tear open from the sides of her face, "What do you think?" she growled, I didn't answer..

"I've been seeing you every day in my dreams, seeing your life, your paradise. And my master has brought me and the others here, to smell the flowers, feel the clean air and see you", she said everything with so many feelings I couldn't tell if she was sad, mad or happy. "To see me?" I asked, she smiled, "HAHAH no not you, you as in the paradise people, the people in the town. We all have been chosen to find one of our own. The ones with the same energy as us." she was so calm, it was like everything she felt I felt. I wanted to be scared and to scream, but I couldn't, I could only feel the warmth from the sun and a calm cosy feeling, like I was home.

"I gave you new clothes, so we look alike.. You look so much more pretty now"

"What was those screams? Who are you?" I asked

"A gift, for us to connect, don't you feel it? I have been connected to your energy my whole life, but I need you to connect with me before we start the plan"

"Plan? What are we going to do?"

"Oh don't be silly master, we are going to change everyone"
