[\[Part 25\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/17geilf/the_road_to_new_wilderness_part_25/)

Underneath my legs, the stag I’d been loaned from the stables of Ark River slowed his canter to a stop, and flicked both soft, mousy ears toward the front of the caravan.  
“What is it Styx?” I patted his fuzzy neck from the stiff new saddle and tried to ignore the sore spots in my hips, thighs, and rear.   
From the vanguard, Adam rode down the line at a slight trot, and called to Chris, Jamie, and I as he passed. “Rest for fifteen minutes. We should be close, so take care of whatever needs you might have now. I’ll send out scouts to reconnoiter the situation ahead.”  
Stretching, I shifted the Type-9 on my shoulders, and tilted my face back to take in the warm sunshine. It had been years since I’d ridden a horse, much less an oversized deer, and never over rough country at moderate speed. That, combined with being dressed once more in my New Wilderness attire which the ladies of Ark River had graciously washed and patched for me, meant that the handmade saddle rubbed in uncomfortable ways for the last twelve miles. One of the other women fighters told me that I’d get used to it, but for now, the rigid brown leather had ensured that I’d be walking funny upon our return to New Wilderness.  
*And it didn’t even have to buy me dinner first. This saddle has gotten further than any boy ever tried to go. Maybe I should ask it to meet my parents.*  
Everyone dismounted, not a feat for the inflexible with how high the average Bone-Faced Whitetail stood, and made for the trees alongside what used to be a secondary county road. It amazed me how fast nature had overgrown much of the outer edges of the cracked asphalt, the painted lines faded, dirt layered where tires would normally have ground it away. An old green sedan sat rusting in the weeds about twenty yards ahead of me, its metal hood ripped to aluminum shreds, the windshield shattered, the occupants long gone. A line of electrical poles stood like rotting motifs of a forgotten civilization on the opposite side of the road, their wires hanging limp, one of the poles broken and leaning. Haughty black crows squawked at us from atop the telephone poles and bickered with each other over bits of shiny trash they’d collected from the road. Still, despite the bones of human technology, it was a lovely day, with puffy white clouds rolling overhead like cotton balls on a glass pane, brilliant streams of yellow sunlight, and a rich blue sky the shade of Chris’s eyes.  
Several of the 50-strong convoy picked their way into the underbrush in varying directions, and I figured they were looking for a place to relieve themselves out of sight. Seeing as how we had a while, I decided to do the same, and looped Styx’s reins over a sturdy low hanging branch on a nearby oak, my submachine gun in hand.  
I had to claw my way through more than one stubborn shrub, fighting cobwebs, a mud puddle, and a sizable pile of manure from what I guessed would have been a cow until I could barely see the road behind me. While I didn’t want to get lost, I also didn’t want to risk anyone stumbling on me with my trousers down. After all, I still liked to think I had some dignity left.  
Spotting a nice thick oak tree which looked perfect to shield me from sight, I slipped behind it, and started to unzip my backpack for a roll of toilet paper that the Ark River scouts had scrounged from empty houses.  
“I’m telling you, I don’t trust them.”  
My head jerked up at the sound of Jamie’s voice, not far off, somewhere in the woods to my right.  
Sticks crunched, as if someone were pacing, and Chris replied, his tone much lower and reserved. “You didn’t feel that way before, and you knew about their condition then.”  
I set my pack down, and peered around, not wanting to be seen. Neither Jamie, nor Chris had spoken much to each other since last night, and I had yet to get a chance to apologize to Jamie for my outburst. It sounded as though they were close by, maybe a few yards away at most, but the tangle of thorns obscured them from my sight.  
“Only because we needed them to find Hannah.” Jamie hissed back. “Besides, I didn’t really understand what they meant, I thought it was just some stupid religious bullshit. You saw what they did. They hatched people like . . . like freaking bugs. It’s not normal.”  
“What part of this place is ever normal?” Chris sounded irate, as if his patience had begun to wear thin, and I crouched low beside my tree to listen. “For God’s sake, Jamie, they’re not that different from us. They bleed red, they sleep eight hours, and a bunch of them are crapping in the woods if you want to go verify their stomach contents.”  
I watched a caterpillar crawl across a dead leaf by my boot and pondered Jamie’s words. True, the Ark River folk weren’t the usual fare of humanity, but they’d been kind to us, even when they could just as easily have taken advantage of our situation. Their fighters rode to our rescue, Adam was risking his pregnant wife by bringing her along, and Eve had shared her home with us. They were trying to be normal . . . why couldn’t Jamie see that?  
“And what happens if they’re carrying something?” Jamie matched Chris’s low voice with one laden in venom. “They’re born adapted to this environment, and they only interact with outsiders like the pirates or ESLAR at the point of a gun. They eat Breach-made plants and ride around on mutants 24/7. What if they have built-up immunity to some new disease we haven’t been hit with yet? Just taking them with us could wipe out half the fort, maybe more if it became an epidemic and spread to Black Oak. Did you ever think about that?”  
Silence reigned.  
From where I crouched, I bit my lower lip, and frowned. I’d never even considered such a possibility myself. Eve’s people were products of a new world, and it only made sense that unknown bacteria, viruses, and the like might spring from it. While they seemed fine, what if, along with all their amazing intelligence and instincts, the golden-eyed people of Ark River were unknowingly immune to a sickness that could wipe out our kind like roaches in a gas chamber?  
*And we’ve been with them for two whole days. If there’s any kind of slow-burn disease, we might already be dead. We rode their deer, ate their food, took their medicine, and neither they, nor we, wondered for a moment if it would harm us.*  
“That’s what I thought.” Jamie sighed, and some of the aggression left her words, replaced by a strange, almost wounded pleading. “Look, I know we’ve had our differences and I . . . I know where we stand. But I need you to trust me on this. We can’t just go making friends with anyone who isn’t ELSAR, especially not people who’ve been touched by the Breach. It’s too dangerous, too much is at risk. I wouldn’t say it if I weren’t serious.”  
“I know.” Chris grunted quietly, and I heard him draw a long, deep breath. “But we can’t break our word now. We’re almost there, they trust us, and we promised healthcare for Eve and her baby. Imagine how desperate you’d be if you thought one day’s journey could keep your unborn child safe.”  
More feet shuffled on the dry leaves, as if someone kicked at them in unease.  
“So, you won’t listen to me?” Jamie almost whispered it now, in resignation laced with a sadness that hurt to hear.  
“Jamie, come on . . .”  
“No.” Her voice regained its bitter edge, and Jamie’s words blurred with barely concealed rage. “You always do this, just steamroll ahead without asking me first, and then when things go wrong, you keep going anyway as if it will magically get better on its own. I thought after all this time you might have changed.”  
“You really don’t get it, do you?” Chris at last seemed to lose his composure and began to fire back with a heated rebuke. “I’ve tried to reason with you, I’ve tried to listen, but you put up walls every time I confront you on anything. How am I supposed to follow your advice if you can’t admit when you’re wrong? Even Hannah called you on it yesterday, and she was right; you’re a jerk.”  
I dug my thumbnail into my knee, and winced even though they couldn’t see me.  
*Come on guys, I didn’t mean to start all this. Why do you two hate each other so much?*  
Feet stomped, and Jamie’s words shot between gritted teeth. “This was a waste of time. You’re a moron, and the only reason you won’t do what needs to be done is because you’ve got a starry-eyed girl chasing you like some lost puppy. If she knows what’s good for her, she’ll shag someone with a brain, and save herself the headache.”  
The word stabbed into me, hot and painful, and my shoulders slumped.  
*Is that really what you think of me, Jamie?*  
Chris snorted, and something else besides anger coated his voice, a vengeful form of pain. “You mean like Andrew? Did you pick him for his brains, or just the fact that he won’t get end up like Bill? You don’t get to hate these people just because they came from the same place the Birch Crawlers did. Stop using your dead brother as a shield, and take some responsibility for—”  
*Click.*  
I jumped, my eyes widening at the muted report of a hammer locking back on a pistol. With the bushes in the way, I couldn’t tell for sure who had drawn, but I had little doubt as to which one it was.  
“If you ever speak about my brother that way again,” Jamie hissed with a deadliness to her words that chilled me to the bone. “I’ll do what I should have done before the uprising.”  
A twig snapped under a single boot, as if someone had taken one step closer, and Chris’s voice changed to an octave so low, so filled with rage, that he was almost unrecognizable. “Of all the people I stood with against that wall . . . I’m ashamed that one of them was you.”  
Heavy footfalls smashed through the underbrush, as someone stormed off into the trees.  
I didn’t move, didn’t breathe, my mind reeling, a sick twisting in my guts. So many thoughts screamed for me to hear them, but even as I fought to keep my calm, a soft noise cut through the greenery.  
Muted sobs, like someone had their hands over their face, trickled through the leaves, and I recognized Jamie’s sniffles right away. She’d gotten emotional when telling me about her brother, and we’d both shed tears of joy upon our reunion at Ark River, but this was a heavy, soul-crushing weeping that shredded my heart like tissue paper.  
With my back to the oak, I pulled both knees to my chest, and rested my chin on my crossed arms. I like Chris, and Jamie was my best friend. They were both amazing, wonderful people, and just hearing their fight had hurt worse than I would have thought it could. I didn’t want to have to pick a side, I didn’t want to lose either of them, but something about the way they’d snapped at each other told me this was far deeper than a spat between friends.  
*It's almost as if they . . . no, that’s not it. It can’t be. I’m just overthinking things.*  
Panic flooded my mind at the sudden influx of clues, thoughts, and phrases that I’d ignored up until this point. Jamie and Chris had known each other longer than I’d even been here, and the tension between them could very well have masked something else I’d been too blind to see up until now. After all, Chris was so ruggedly handsome, and Jamie had that long beautiful blonde hair to go with her supple curves that put my own to shame. They’d bickered, poked fun at each other, and fought at every step from the crash site in an intimate way that I never questioned before.  
But if the nagging voice inside my head was right, then it only made sense.  
Perhaps their anger wasn’t born from hate, but something else, something deeper, stronger . . . something far more painful when betrayed.  
Too scared of my own thoughts to carry on with my previous task, I waited until I heard Jamie’s boots swish away through the briars and crept back to the caravan.  
Most of the others were already back at their mounts, Jamie and Chris both too preoccupied to notice my return. Jamie’s eyes were red, and Chris tugged at the straps of his saddle with weary, half-hearted pulls. Part of me wanted to go to both of them, to give each a hug, and tell them how much they meant to me, but I couldn’t. Jamie’s words about me being a ‘lost puppy’ stung with an acidity that reminded me of Carla’s tough love policy, and Chris’s dark anger shocked me for how it had affected Jamie. Moreover, a tidal wave of despair threatened to drown me in self-pity, as I glanced at my own reflection in a nearby puddle.  
*Skinny, plain, brown-haired Hannah. No match for someone like Jamie. No interest to someone like Chris. A nobody, from nowhere, with nothing.*  
In the end, I merely got back on the ever-loyal Styx, patted his fluffy brown neck, and steered him back into line with the other deer.  
Hours stretched by, asphalt giving way to gravel, the sun sliding by overhead. Time slowed to a snail’s pace, made worse by the fact that I rode behind both Chris and Jamie, and had to watch their shoulders slouch with every step our mounts made toward New Wilderness. It got so bad, that I halfway wished for a band of mutants to appear just to rescue me from my invisible torment, though the cheery sun high in the sky guaranteed that to be a minimal chance.  
*Bawoo.*  
One of the hunting horns carried by the forward scouts split the air, and I looked up to see a ridgeline in the distance, topped with a ring of palisade, and surrounded by fields, chain-link fences, and small herds of exotic animals.  
New Wilderness. At long last, we were back.  
Trucks rumbled through the gates by the time we were a quarter mile out, and they swung to meet us with the armored turrets trained in our direction, the long machine-gun barrels glinting in the early afternoon sun. After so many days spent in the south, with the pirates on their old wooden ship, or the Ark River denizens with their medieval village, the pickup trucks dazzled me in a magical way, enough to make me briefly smile.  
*How I’ve missed the smell of diesel exhaust.*  
Chris spurred his deer to ride for the front of the caravan, but Jamie didn’t follow, and I decided to stay behind as well. I didn’t want to be party to more important conversations; at this point all I craved was a hot shower, something to eat, and to slip into my bed at the lodge so I wouldn’t have to think.   
Thinking only made me feel worse.  
I waited on Styx’s back, the trucks and our vanguard meeting about a hundred yards down the road and distracted myself with daydreams of my mother’s baking skills. Today of all days, I missed her ability to whip up mouthwatering chocolate desserts that were to die for, and I imagined her and Dad’s faces as they brought out my cake alight with twenty slender birthday candles.  
*Maybe I can buy some kind of pastry in the market. I could share it with Jamie, if she’s still upset. Who am I kidding, she’s got Andrew to make her feel better, why would she want a ‘lost puppy’ to hang around her all day?*  
My emotions warred inside my head, resentment, sadness, unease, and loneliness all roiling into a sour knot that made me wish I’d relieved myself on our last stop.  
Ahead, the trucks revved, turned, and rolled back up the road to New Wilderness, our riders thundering back to the caravan.  
“Onward, at a canter.” Adam called, his face covered in a broad smile.  
Chris galloped back to where Jamie and I waited, his cheeks flush with triumph and the day’s sweat. He started to say something, but caught Jamie’s eye, which sapped the energy from him, and Chris lapsed back into broody silence.  
Our column moved into a faster pace, and the gates loomed so close that I could see our sentries atop the walls. They swung open as soon as our scouts got close, and I prodded Styx to follow.  
The parking lot outside the visitor’s center held a throng of people, more running from wherever they’d been busy at work to join in the spectacle. As the fifty riders from Ark River trotted to a stop inside the gates, all eyes took in our arrival with open-mouthed shock. Many pointed and whispered, staring at the golden hair and eyes of the congregants, with more of them taking cautious steps back from the enormous Bone-Faced Whitetail. In the sunshine, with their antlers gleaming white instead of their nocturnal green glow, the deer pawed and snorted in nervousness, and were intimidating to behold.  
*If they knew how easily to defeat them with a bowl of caramel apples, they wouldn’t be so scared.*  
That put a rare chuckle in my throat, and I gave Styx another scratch behind his ears, glad that I could at least count on him.  
A group of people waded through to the front of the crowd, and the tall, muscled physique of Sean, the gray hair of Rodney Carter, Dr. O’Brian’s tan slacks, and the greasy work overhauls of Ethan Sanderson emerged to greet us.  
Adam and Eve swung down from their saddles, and I mimicked them alongside the rest of the convoy, my legs burning from stiffness.  
“Welcome to New Wilderness.” Sean extended a hand to Adam, a polite grin on his handsome face. “I’m Sean Hammond, officer in charge of operations here. Our patrol radioed ahead that you were coming.”  
They shook hands, and Adam waved Eve forward from the ranks of armored fighters. “Adam Stirling, pastor of the Ark River Church of Redemption. And this is my wife, Eve. We’re honored to be here.”  
From the lineup of officials, Dr. O’Brian spotted me, and her face lit up. “Seems you brought back our wayward rangers.”  
At her recognition, and I waved from where I stood by Jamie. I liked Dr. O’Brian, even if she had some explaining to do about the eerie contents of her office. At this point, with my two best friends at war with each other, I would take any outside companionship I could get.  
Anything to avoid the type of disappointment I feared most.  
“Some of them.” Carter’s mouth drew into a thin line on his face, and he eyed the rifles slung on the shoulders of each Ark River trooper with suspicion. “Nice hardware you folks are packing. Military issue, right?”  
“ELSAR has been very generous.” Adam winked in sarcasm and shrugged off his own rifle strap to hand the weapon to Carter for inspection. “Not that they meant to be. We’ve been fighting them for a while now, but they aren’t as mobile as we are with their heavy trucks.”  
Eve beckoned for a contingent of riders at the center of our column, their stags laden down with bundles and bags. “We brought gifts for you. Most of it is food, but we added in some clothing and tools as well. I hope you don’t mind.”  
“Only a fool is too proud for charity.” Ethan spoke up for the first time, his words short and simple compared to the practiced formality of the other officials and wiped his grimy hands on his overhauls to offer a handshake. “Many thanks.”  
Turning to pick me out beside Chris and Jamie, Adam met Sean’s eye. “There is a special matter that we need to discuss. It concerns your three rangers, or rather, a certain item they found in the south. Is there somewhere more discreet we could go?”  
*So now it comes to it.*  
I gulped a nervous lump and rubbed at the nylon backpack strap on my left shoulder. Things were cordial now, but in a few moments, all that could vanish. Ice clogged my veins, and a cold sweat broke out on my brow. Part of me thought about jumping back on Styx, and galloping out the gate, but I knew that would only delay the inevitable.  
“Of course.” Sean’s face fell into a harder, more stoic contour, and he waved for Chris, Jamie and myself to follow as the four New Wilderness officials strode for the lodge. “Ethan, have some of your men help the newcomers unload, and we’ll meet in my office in ten minutes. This way.”  
My hands shook, and I spun around to give Styx one last pat across his long nose, the protruding bone on his skull cold in the fall breeze.  
“You okay?”  
I blinked in surprise at Jamie, who watched me with a fatigued line for a mouth, not happy, not angry, just idling in some form of emotional neutral. Dark bags lined her eyes, and not all of the redness had dissipated from her earlier tears. She looked just as stressed as I felt, and a surge of guilt wormed through me at how selfish my moping had been.  
“Yeah, I’m good.” I avoided her gaze and handed Styx’s reins off to another warrior. “Just tired from the trip.”  
My eyes drifted away from my boots long enough to catch Chris watching me from behind Jamie, his own expression cloaked in doubt and concern as he slung his new rifle. They both had to see my discomfort, I still sucked at lying enough that it was obvious, but neither could possibly know why it existed.  
*Maybe they never should.*  
Yes, that was it. I had to be the strong one for once. Chris and Jamie were in a bad place, and they needed a friend they could count on, not some depressed sponge to ooze out more problems. I could be what Matt and Carla never were, kind and self-sacrificing, in the name of my friends’ continued betterment. Like in the spider nest, I wouldn’t run from this horrible fate, but face it head on, and take the rejection, the loneliness, the oppressive weight of my inadequacy with gusto. I would do it, and I would give it my all, no matter how much it ripped at my heart.  
“Come on.” I plastered on a fake smile and made sure to catch them both with eye contact, my voice awash in faux ease. “They need us in there. Once Sean hears about our trip, he’ll probably give you both medals. You deserve it.”  
With that, I gripped the strap of my Type-9, and marched up the walkway toward the lodge, glad for the cover of the cherry grove so that neither Chris, nor Jamie, could see the hopeless misery pooling in my eyes.
