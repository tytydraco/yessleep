I am an artist. I enjoy creating art in my spare time and I create elaborate paintings mainly using acrylic paint and colored pencils. I often will channel my emotions into my art as a way of destressing after a long day and it serves as a form of therapy of some sorts.

I have been having a specially rough couple of months recently and I had a hard time dealing with it so I decided to put all of my feelings into one large painting.

My father passed away from a long illness and as a result I was having a really hard time at work. My manager pulled me into his office and berated me about my performance. He said I was slacking off and seemed out of it most of the time. He didn't want to fire me but as if I kept up with my performance as it was he will have no choice but to do so.

I left his office in tears and couldn't believe how people I've worked with for seven years now didn't think of me as nothing more than expendable material. My manager knew about my father's passing and how close I was with him. He was my only remaining family after my mother died four years ago in a driving accident.

I went home absolutely distraught and decided to pour all of my frustrations and pain into a large 5ft by 9ft portret painting of a woman standing on the top of the stairs overlooking the city. She was facing the city looking at the beauty of the city light in the otherwise dark world, her gorgeous peach gown spilling around her. The painting was supposed to represent the falce beauty of the world around us. Since you could only see the woman's back and no one could see her face, no one knew what she really looked like or how she was feeling.

I worked on the painting all night and half of the next day. When I was finally satisfied with the painting I took a shower and went to work feeling much better releasing all of my pent up emotions into my work. I felt a lot lighter and all of my cowercers noticed it. My manager approached me satisfied thinking his previous conversation with me was very productive and had no issues with him thinking that. I was already set out to find another job as soon as possible because I didn't want to work for someone who had no respect for me and saw me as nothing more than an expendable object.

I went home exhausted and after taking a quick shower hopped into bed hoping to put a couple more details on to my painting. 

I was woken up at around two in the morning by strange footsteps. I lived alone so I was terrified someone broke into my house. I quickly grabbed a bat I kept in my closet for emergencies but I never thought I would have to use it. What is the intruder is armed? A baseball bat is not going to do anything again the gun.

I slowly made my way down the hall to the top of the stairs that led downstairs to the living room area. I saw a silhouette standing at the top of the stairs looking at my living room. I thought I could catch the intruder off guard and possibly knock them out before the police get here.

The moment I thought of approaching the silhouette a strange sounds started coming out of it.
"Hello Julia.", the silhouette spoke.
How did it know my name? I looked closer and the person was wearing the exact same gown as the woman in my painting.
Was someone playing a prank on me? But how is that possible? I haven't showered anyone my painting yet. I didn't even take a photo of it because I was in a hurry to get to work the previous day.

Right as I thought that the woman corned around. Her face was distorted. Her mouth was stretched in a terrifying grin showing off her incredibly sharp teeth, almost like a monster from a horror movie. Her eyer were blood red and almost glowing with what looked like murderous intent and hatred for the entire world.

What is going on? I was frozen in place unable to move. I was terrified. What is this creature and what is it doing in my house? I was probably looking at it for less than ten seconds but it seemed like hours have passed with me unable to move a single muscle.

I forced myself to blink and the creature seemed to have disappeared just as quickly as it appeared. I thought I was finally starting to loose my mind. I would not have been surprised with everything going on with my life. There was no noise in the house. The house was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. I must have imagined the footsteps as well. Maybe it was just a dream. Maybe I was just sleepwalking. I heard people could sleepwalk from stress and God knows I've been under a lot of stress lately.

I went back to my room and decided to try falling back asleep. I haven't slept for almost three days  finishing that painting. That's it! It was the lack of sleep. I've heard lack of sleep in addition to stress can cause people to hallucinate. I went back to sleep and decided to forget the whole thing. I heard footsteps in my hallway again and decided it was just my imagination. I really need to get some sleep.
