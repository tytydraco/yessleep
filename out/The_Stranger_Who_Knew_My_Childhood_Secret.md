It was a rainy Thursday evening when I first saw him. I was sitting in my usual corner at the local coffee shop, sipping a latte and scrolling through my phone, when a man walked in. He was tall, with a worn leather jacket and a face that looked like it had seen too much of the world. But what caught my attention were his eyes—piercing blue, almost unnervingly familiar.



He ordered a black coffee and, to my surprise, sat down at my table without asking. “Mind if I join you?” he said, though he was already pulling out the chair. His voice was low, gravelly, and carried an air of authority that made it hard to say no.



I nodded, unsure of what to say. He didn’t introduce himself or make small talk. Instead, he leaned forward, his eyes locking onto mine, and said, “You used to hide your lunch money in the hollow of the old oak tree by the playground. Every day, without fail.”



I froze. My latte slipped from my hand, spilling across the table. How could he possibly know that? It was a secret I hadn’t told anyone—not even my closest friends. When I was eight years old, I’d been bullied relentlessly at school. To keep my lunch money safe, I’d stash it in the hollow of an oak tree near the playground, retrieving it only when I needed to buy food. It was my little secret, one I’d buried deep in my memory.



“Who are you?” I whispered, my voice trembling.



He ignored my question and continued, “You stopped doing it after the day you saw the man in the red jacket. He was standing under the tree, watching you. You were so scared that you ran home and never went back.”



My heart was pounding now. That day was etched into my mind like a scar. I’d never told anyone about the man in the red jacket. Not my parents, not my teachers, not even my therapist. It was a memory I’d tried to forget.



“How do you know this?” I demanded, my voice rising. A few people in the coffee shop glanced over, but the man didn’t seem to care.



He leaned back in his chair, sipping his coffee as if we were discussing the weather. “Because I was the man in the red jacket,” he said calmly.



I felt like the ground had been ripped out from under me. My mind raced, trying to make sense of his words. “What do you mean? Why were you watching me? What do you want?”



He set his coffee down and looked at me with an expression I couldn’t quite place—somewhere between regret and resolve. “I wasn’t there to hurt you,” he said. “I was there to protect you.”



“Protect me? From what?”



He hesitated, as if weighing his words carefully. “From the man who was following you. The one who’d been watching you for weeks. The one who… never mind. It’s not important now.”



“Not important?!” I nearly shouted. “You can’t just drop something like that and say it’s not important!”



He sighed, running a hand through his graying hair. “Look, I didn’t come here to upset you. I came here to warn you. He’s back. And he’s watching you again.”



I felt a chill run down my spine. “Who’s back? What are you talking about?”



Before he could answer, his phone buzzed. He glanced at it, his expression darkening. “I have to go,” he said, standing abruptly. “But listen to me carefully. Be careful who you trust. And whatever you do, don’t go back to that tree.”



With that, he turned and walked out of the coffee shop, leaving me sitting there, stunned and terrified. I wanted to chase after him, to demand answers, but my legs felt like lead. Instead, I sat there, staring at the empty chair, my mind racing with questions.



Who was he? How did he know about my childhood secret? And most importantly, who was the man he claimed was watching me—then and now?



That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about the oak tree, the man in the red jacket, and the stranger who’d just upended my life. Against my better judgment, I decided to go back to the tree. I had to know the truth.



The next morning, I drove to my old elementary school. The playground was still there, though the oak tree looked smaller than I remembered. My hands shook as I approached it, my heart pounding in my chest. I reached into the hollow, half-expecting to find something—anything—that would explain what was happening.



But it was empty. Just like it had been all those years ago.



As I stood there, a cold breeze swept through the park, sending a shiver down my spine. That’s when I noticed it—a small, folded piece of paper tucked into a crevice in the bark. I pulled it out and unfolded it with trembling hands.



It was a note, written in neat, blocky letters: \*“You shouldn’t have come back.”\*
