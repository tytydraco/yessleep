I was packing up to move out when I found it.

A narrow crack in the wall behind the closet. I would’ve missed it if I hadn’t dropped my phone and watched it vanish into the gap. When I pulled the panel loose, I found a crawlspace. About five feet tall, six feet wide, and pitch black.

It smelled like damp carpet and something… old. Not just rot. Something lived-in. Like breath that had been trapped too long.

I shined my flashlight in and froze.

There was a bed in there. An old metal frame with a thin mattress, dusty but clearly used. Crumpled sheets. A half-empty water bottle. A single shoe.

And a crayon drawing pinned to the far wall.

It showed a stick figure in a bed, and another figure standing beside it. Scribbled entirely in black.

Below it, in shaky handwriting:
“He watches me sleep.”

I backed out and called my landlord. He paused too long when I told him. Said he didn’t know about any crawlspace. But his voice didn’t sound surprised. It sounded… tired. Like he’d had this conversation before.

I didn’t sleep that night. Couldn’t. I kept replaying the drawing in my head. Wondering how long that bed had been there. Wondering if it was ever mine. Wondering if I’d been alone this whole time.

The next morning, I checked the crawlspace again.

The bed was made.

The drawing was gone.

But there was a new one.

It showed me—in bed, staring at the closet.

The black figure was closer now.

Below it, in the same messy crayon:
“He doesn’t like being seen.”

I packed a bag and left.

Checked into a cheap motel off the highway. I didn’t tell anyone where I was going. I didn’t want him to follow. I thought if I left, I could break whatever this was.

But that night, the front desk clerk asked if I needed another key.

Said my “brother” had already checked in.

I told him I didn’t have a brother.

He looked confused and said, “He said the same thing about you.”

I went back to the apartment the next day.

The door was locked from the inside. The chain was bolted. But when I finally got it open with the landlord’s help, everything inside was… wrong.

The apartment was spotless. Cleaner than I’d ever kept it. My sheets were tucked in tight. My clothes were folded and put away—some in drawers I never use. Even the air smelled different. Like aftershave. A brand I don’t own.

The crawlspace door was shut.

Taped to it was another crayon drawing.

This one showed two identical stick figures. One in bed. One standing.

The one in bed had no face.

Below it:
“Only one of us can stay.”

I didn’t go inside.

I couldn’t.

I left again. Back to the motel. But sleep wouldn’t come. Around 3:12 AM, I woke up to tapping on the window. Soft, rhythmic. When I pulled the curtain back, no one was there.

Just another drawing. Taped from the outside.

It showed me, asleep in the motel bed.

The black figure was standing outside the window, smiling.

But in this drawing, I wasn’t in the bed anymore.

Now he was.

I tore it down. Threw it away. Slept with the lights on.

But when I woke up the next morning, there was another drawing on the nightstand.

It showed him—sitting at the motel breakfast table. Eating cereal. Wearing my face.

The front desk clerk greeted me by the wrong name.

Said I checked in two days ago.

Said he already gave me a receipt.

That’s when I noticed it.

My reflection in the lobby mirror was delayed by just a second. And when I turned away, I swear it kept watching.

I drove home. I don’t know why. I didn’t want to, but my body just kept going. Like it had already decided.

The crawlspace door was wide open.

The mattress was still warm.

And there was one last drawing. Taped to the ceiling above my bed.

No stick figures this time.

Just a single black shape. Unfolding. Crawling toward the viewer on too many limbs.

And in perfect handwriting, almost elegant:
“Thank you for leaving. I wear you better than you ever did.”

That was three days ago.

Or maybe it was yesterday.

I haven’t seen him since, not directly. But I feel him. In the mirrors. In the way light flickers just a little too long. In the way people hesitate when they look at me, like they’re trying to remember something they’ve already forgotten.

I tried going back to work. My keycard didn’t work. Security said my file was terminated.

When I asked to speak to my manager, he gave me this odd, strained smile—like he didn’t recognize me. Or like he thought he wasn’t supposed to.

When I got back to my car, there was a parking pass on the dash.

It had my name on it.

But the photo wasn’t me.

It was him. Wearing my smile too wide. His eyes just a little too bright.

I don’t remember taking that photo.

That night, I found a new drawing taped to my fridge.

It showed my apartment, but everything was mirrored—backward. Even the numbers on the door.

The figure inside was him. Alone. Sitting at the table. Eating dinner.

Beneath it, in perfect handwriting:
“Home is where he isn’t.”

I burned it in the sink.

But the next morning it was back. Same drawing. Same message. Perfectly centered on the fridge again.

I think he’s not just copying me.

He’s replacing me.

Every time I blink, I lose something. My voice sounds different in recordings. My laugh isn’t mine anymore. Sometimes when I speak, it feels like I’m remembering how.

And earlier today, I looked in the mirror and didn’t recognize myself.

Not because my face had changed. But because I felt like an intruder wearing it.

I found a final drawing this morning.

It wasn’t taped to anything.

It was under my skin.

Just beneath the surface of my forearm. I felt a lump and dug until my fingernails scraped something dry and smooth. Folded paper. I pulled it free.

One perfect, elegant line written across it:

“There’s nothing left for you to be.”
