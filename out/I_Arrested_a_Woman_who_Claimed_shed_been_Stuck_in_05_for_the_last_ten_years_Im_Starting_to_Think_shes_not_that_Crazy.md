[Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/reql1r/ive_been_stuck_in_the_year_2005_for_over_a_decade/)

I stare in at her via the two-way mirror, her sitting pristinely on the bolted down plastic chair with her forearms lain on the edges of the industrial-style table inside the interrogation room. The file we have on her – paltry as it is seeing as she isn’t a scumbag – says she’s forty-two. But to my eye, she could pass for thirty-five, twenty-eight, for a woman even half her age. Her long neck and legs, narrow shoulders, avian bone structure, and the pinkish hue in her cheeks strip off at least a decade from her appearance. No matter how you slice it, she’s a looker.

The only thing that marks her age is her eyes. They aren’t bloodshot marbles, coked-up pinpricks or are even especially baggy. On the surface, their deep chestnut, almost black-pupil colour finishes her effortless grandeur. It’s what’s behind them. A jadedness. A hollowness. As if she knows the misery of a thousand years of suffering. The kind visage you imagine war widows used to cultivate behind the iron curtain. Her eyes have that blank dead look to which I’ve grown accustom, being on the Job now nineteen years and working Homicide for seven. As soon as I looked into those near-black orbs, I knew we’d found our perp.

“So what’chu thinking, Irish?” asks my partner Detective Diedre Kwan, standing next to me with hands on hips like a teapot. “You thinkin’ me or you?”

Diedre and I have developed a good rhythm for how to work a suspect in the interrogation room. How to make ‘em crack, how to keep ‘em from clamming up. I’m the primary investigator on this case: our VIC Joshua Clayborn, Missus Lorraine Clayborn’s husband, having been found dead in their open-concept home in Meadowville the day after Boxing Day. Still, me being the primary doesn’t necessarily mean I take the lead in the interview. I’m a six foot one, stooped white dude with buck teeth, a Spalding-sized potbelly and elfin ears that stick out too far from my hatchet-faced head. I can be a bit too intimidating to get the most out of some suspects, especially the ones not used to being in the soup. With my creased sports jacket and lopsided tie, Stevie Wonder could clock me for police. My partner Diedre, on the other hand, is young and pretty – though a bit goth with her heavy black eyeshadow, straight black bob, and a boyish contralto – making her sound like a tween male at times. When it comes to wheedling out a confession in the box, she does good with children, prostitutes, battered women, and closet-pedophiles. Wife beaters, gangsters, and pearl-clutching-grannies are my specialty.

“Hrm,” I mumble, my forehead cradled in the curve of my wrist, my forearm pressed to the glass, my eyes on Lorraine Clayborn. She’s placed her hands in her lap, giving her the Whistler’s Mother profile. “I’m thinking you.”

Peripherally, I catch Diedre cock an eyebrow, like The Rock. I anticipate the requisite protest out of professional courtesy. Again, I am the primary on this case.

“You sure on that, Irish?” she asks. I wince at the repetition of my nickname. My real name is Tim English, Timothy Declan English on my birth certificate, but when I started off as a beat cop in the city, the old heads in the department, mostly of Irish and Scottish stock, didn’t like such a brazenly Loyalist handle for an officer. And I got more than my fair share of history lessons from a few sons of Erin in blue about the scourge, Oliver Cromwell. So to appease the boys in the bureau, knowing that you can’t make it on the Job without friends, I let them call me Irish, as they’d suggested out of a surly sense of irony. The thing of it is, my folks have told me, since the time I was in short pants, that our family is in fact of Irish heritage. Irish-Catholic to boot. My great-grandfather, Fergus O’Keefe, had immigrated to the New World sometime in the late nineteenth century – whether it was to flee the potato famine or as an indentured servant has long been lost to time. The story goes that when he landed in Toronto, armed with the knowledge that the Irish were frowned upon here, he changed his name to English and converted to the United Church. For most my life, I accepted this as gospel, until the story of my grandpappy began evolving among my relatives, and many of the historical details simply didn’t add up. Plus, I’m sure even some Gaelic-talking farm boy from Buttfuck Connaught could’ve conceived of a better Protestant-sounding name than *English*.

On top of the unshakeable nickname, I have to check the sports page every day, so I know the hockey scores, to make it seem like I’m one of the boys. That and keep a Blue Jays mug on my desk and pretend that I’m heart-broken every year when the Maple Leafs don’t make the playoffs. I guess that’s why Diedre and I have always gotten along: she’s the only skirt in a department crowded with and ran by men. She’s a good detective though, so she’s been spared the token label for female cops: receptionist with a sidearm.

As far as nicknames go, Diedre herself has always gone by Donkey Kong, given her initials are DK. I’ve always opted to calling her Dee, which she doesn’t mind. But all the nicknames, the formalities, the lying in the box, the office politics, the boy’s club chit-chat with the hockey scores, are all getting to me lately. It’s like our whole day to day is just some simulation. Like everything we do is phony. Fake.

Presently, I answer Dee’s question.

“Yeah,” I say, nodding my head. “Our intel says she’s an educated broad. Shit, she even worked in the prosecutor’s office, right? Plus, she’s got no priors. Nah, you take the lead; I do better with the professional losers.”

“True, you’re right,” she says, her dragging intonation telling me she’s not satisfied. Laying on the professional courtesy a bit thick for my taste. “Still, I think she’ll get catty with me. Clam up on us.”

“Why’s that?” I say on exhale, my vociferous sigh meant to signal my tiring of this back and forth.

“My man, when patrol picked her up, she was holed up in a puke-green motel room meant for pay-by-the-hour clientele. All indications are that she’d been there for days, probably since she offed her hubby.”

“Allegedly.”

“*Allegedly*, yeah, whatever. But her designer shirts and Armani suits were pressed, she had her hair correct, and her makeup and eyebrows were on point. And that was while she was getting fucked up behind a fifth of Polar Ice on the regular. And just look at her. Just look at her. She’s hot. That’s a woman fighting father time and winning. I mean, look at how close you got your nose to the glass.”

I bite my lip, pulling back from the two-way mirror and ramming my hands into my pockets. I’m trying not to smile. Hoping like hell I’m not blushing. It’s weird, I can cut up women with the best of them when I’m around the boys. It’s just different with Dee.

“What’s your point?” I ask.

“My point is, we go in there, she’ll defer to you. If she sees some pretty young thing coming at her, the claws will come out.”

Pursing my lips, I nod and mumble loud enough for her to hear, “Good thing we don’t have any of those in the bureau.”

“What?”

“Pretty young things.”

Having anticipated my remark, Dee backhands my shoulder. “Dick,” she curses, smiling despite herself.

I chuckle, glancing her way in tacit apology.

“I still think you should take this one.” I look my partner full in the face. My mind made up. “Give it a *woman’s touch*, you know?”

Dee rolls her eyes and follows me into the box.

“Good evening, Missus Clayborn,” my partner begins while we’re settling across the table from the suspect. Clayborn isn’t cuffed to the iron bar on the table. Another officer has read her her rights, but only once. She has no history of violence. No criminal record at all. She’s a civilian, but with her being a criminal lawyer, we have to be straight up with her as she probably knows all the games cops play to get a confession. We have to hope she’ll agree to cooperate. That she’s racked with enough guilt to spill her guts with the slightest coaxing. After all, she didn’t seem to put much effort into hiding; the motel we found her in was in Milton, barely 30 kilometers from our district, and she’d used her credit card to pay. It was easy pickings scooping her up after her husband’s body was found.

“Hello,” she responds, coldly. Just loud enough for us to catch.

“Just to clear the air,” says Dee, now seated, our manilla folder with the sparse report lain on the table. “You are not under arrest, and we can end the interview at any time.”

“I know how this works,” she says, biting out each word and hissing on the last syllable.

Worried we’ve already gotten off on the wrong foot, I announce my presence by uproariously clearing my throat. “Missus Clayborn,” I begin. “May I call you Lorraine, actually?”

“Lo,” she croons, a welcoming smile breaking across her oval face. Her hair is tied back in a bun, so I can see her face clearly. “That’s what my friends call me.”

“Okay, Lo,” I chuckle, a bit beguiled. I then catch a look from my partner, a short glance that says, *See? Told you*. “You see Lo, we’re investigating the death of your husband, Joshua. His body was found in your home about two days ago.”

Still smiling, Lo’s chin hits her collarbone, her brow knitting to announce tears that never come.

“Yes,” she sighs, her voice thick with faux remorse. “Yes, I thought as much. That this was because of what happened.”

“See, Lo,” I keep on, switching into the lead interrogator, “we found your husband face down, in what we presume to be his study. In a state of undress.”

“We also found cyanide in his bloodstream,” Dee chimes in. She’s not exactly playing bad cop, just filling in the gaps with unsavory details. Letting me lead.

“There was also sodium cyanide found in the two mugs of coco left on the kitchen counter.”

All of these things I found while casing the scene: an anonymous tip from a young lady that Joshua was missing leading patrol to a welfare check on the house; Josh’s carcass leading to a call to Homicide. Mister and Missus Clayborn have two children – Jennifer, thirteen, and Tobias, eleven. Neither have been located. With no close relatives nearby, and this being the Christmas holiday, we can’t be sure where they’ve gone or for how long they’ve been missing.

Lo chuckles once without parting her lips. A mirthless laugh. “You found all that?” she asks, her eyes embedded in the beech tabletop. “I thought that stuff was untraceable.”

I blink in rapidity, then meet eyes with my partner. “It’s not untraceable, Ma’am,” I say slowly. “But it can go unnoticed by an untrained eye.”

“Please. Call me, Lo.”

Under a trained or untrained eye, sodium cyanide can easily go undiscovered in an autopsy if you don’t know that that’s what you’re looking for. When I saw her husband – literally lying ass-naked on the floor, like he’d just bought the farm while beating his meat – I don’t know why, but something compelled me to turn him over a second time and inspect more closely. This led me to a purple dollar-sized bruise on his left buttock, beside a sliver-trail of dried blood, the tell-tale signs of a needle puncture. Beyond that, I don’t know how I knew to direct forensics to dust the mugs and thoroughly examine the Swiss Mix, now cold and swamped with dead, floating blowflies. I like to think I’m a good detective, but I’ve never had that kind of insight. Or rather foresight. No one does. Especially with a scene that at the outset looked so innocuous. That kind of shit only happens in movies.

“Well, Lo, the truth is that we had suspected he’d suffered a simple heart-attack, but I just had this nagging hunch there was more to it. We also grew more suspicious when no one showed up to the house the night we found him.”

Forming her lips into a thin line, the crocodile tears still threatening but for now at bay, she begins nodding her head. A good sign. A harbinger of a forthcoming confession.

“Where are your children, Missus Clayborn?” asks Dee, wisely choosing not to act as familiar with the suspect as I have. Without making a sound, I glare at her. We’ll get to them later, I try to telegraph with a scowl. I figure she’ll tell us everything after she confesses to offing her husband. But we don’t want to risk scaring this squirrel back up her tree. Not until we have leverage.

Lo makes a sharp bleating sound, an imitation of a sob. Out of her line of vision, I roll my eyes, thinking she might have been a hell of a lawyer back in her day, but she wasn’t shit at acting. But as we watch her, it grows clearer by the second that Dee’s question has touched something. She is in fact weeping. Real tears.

This woman murdered her husband. If I was uncertain when we picked her up, I am absolutely positive now. But her two kids, that’s another story. Maybe she knows where they are, maybe she doesn’t. But she hasn’t killed them. On that point too, I am absolutely positive.

Once Lo’s tears start to ebb, her sobs fading, I give my partner the stink eye again for good measure. The message clear: *Lay off the kids.*

“Listen, Lo,” I croon, laying a hammy paw over her bony rectangular hand. “Why don’t we go back to Josh. Is there anyway – do you have any idea who might have done this to him? Did he have any enemies? Something from work, maybe? An angry ex-girlfriend perhaps?”

Balking at my suggestions, Lo roars with unhappy guffaws. “You don’t have to beat around the bush, detective. I know what this is. I used to hang around some of the detectives in the bureau when I worked out of the prosecutor’s office. Your inspector, Mike Catney, and I used to shoot pool at Captain Snooker on Friday nights. I know what you want. So let’s get to it. I did it.”

I can feel Dee tensing beside me, straining not to push, worried she’ll somehow fuck up and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

“I need you to be more specific, Lo,” I say, taking the load off Dee’s shoulders. My elbows pressed into the rounded table edge. I look over my shoulder, double checking that the wall mounted camera is still there, recording this crucial moment.

“I did it,” she repeats vociferously, looking across the desk at us like she might her children on Christmas morning. “I killed him. I killed my husband, Joshua.”

Still crouched over the desk, my partner Dee likewise poised, we both exhale in exquisite simultaneous relief. This investigation could have gone nowhere, costing us hours trying to uncover further evidence that had probably already been destroyed. It’s no less than a Godsend that she came in ready to confess. Another name in black on the board. Another win in the Homicide Unit’s column.

I excuse myself to retrieve the tape recorder. When I return, Lo gladly repeats her confession while the tape’s rolling.

We read her her rights one more time. She then carries on, dry-eyed and monotone, telling us how exactly she murdered her husband. Despite the grim subject matter, her voice grows soft and somniferous, making those throaty clicking sounds on each consonant – giving me ASMR. She tells us everything; where she got the cyanide; how she planned to murder him and the kids with tainted beverages – hot coco for the kids, a large scotch for the hubby – and how she had a syringe of venom in case something went wrong. Like the first time.

Dee and I both furrow our brows. Like the first time? How many families has this woman gone through? She then proceeds to tell us she’s done this before – each time, each Christmas, killing her husband, her children, and then herself so the four of them could repeat the year all over again. In blissful ignorance, of course. She says it’s part of the deal she made with some character named Mister Morgenstern, after her husband told her he was leaving her for some piece of tail fresh out of grade twelve. Mister Morgenstern – no first name, no address, no official occupation. Just Mister Morgenstern and a vague description of a mid-30s Caucasian male with red hair and a tacky plaid on plaid suit.

She then explains the rules of this universe she’s created with Mister Morgenstern to us:

1.     Lorraine and her immediate family are alive forever in a looping eternity of 2005. Everything that occurs in that year, world news, popular culture, media events, her family, happen just as usual. Hurricane Katrina, the Iraq War, Carrie Underwood and so on.

2.     Her family is under a trance; they are able to access their memory of previous rotations but are enticed not to. This one was the hardest for me to swallow until Lorraine did some coaxing of her own: “Think about it. We all go about our day to day without thinking about the previous year, the previous month, the previous week even. We don’t question what’s put in front of us as long as we have the comfort of routine. How many of us take time out to examine our daily lives?”

3.     Others in this 2005 dreamworld act and react as they normally would. They are still manipulated by Mister Morgenstern and figments of Lorraine and her family’s memories but will nonetheless act appropriately to given stimuli. I.e., Lorraine and her family can still be arrested for breaking the law inside the dreamworld.

4.     When a person actually dies outside the dreamworld – not counting Lorraine, Josh and her children – their image will still appear, but this may cause problems. Compounded with their fading memories of everyone and the physical decay of the person’s body, the holograph projected in the dreamworld may begin to glitch – revealing the cadaverous form beyond the dreamworld.

5.     The trancelike state of the world can be broken through logic, observation, and reason. Again, most people don’t want to face reality. It is up to Morgenstern’s client, in this case, Lorraine, to assure the other marks that everything is fine despite noticeable inconsistency. To assure them to ignore their lying eyes.

6.     The ritual. For 2005 to loop itself each year – or rotation as Lorraine calls them – she and her family must all die within five hours of the same initial slaying. In this case, Lorraine chose to kill her children before midnight on Christmas Day. After midnight, the 2005 calendar would resume as normal, and all parties in the world would continue their trance-induced state. Lorrain acknowledges this was a mistake; she ought to have chosen New Year’s Eve to perform the ritual to avoid inconsistencies that could be easily spotted by the marks. Though, really, how often do we really notice the date? How often do people continuing writing the old year days after the new year has begun before noticing their error?

7.     There will be consequences if rule 6 is not followed perfectly each rotation. Lorraine withdraws sheepishly on this one. I suspect she’s been figuring out those consequences lately.

8.     Outside the 2005 dreamworld, Lorraine and her family are dead. They died on the first night the murder ritual was performed. There is no leaving this 2005 purgatory.

9.     Real world news outside the 2005 simulation can be accessed via library archives – this includes chronicles of the years since 2005. This one seems odd, but Lorraine insists this is true. She suspects they are placed there by outside forces. Which brings her to rule 10.

10.  None of the holographs – like Detective Kwan or myself, for example – can enable Lorraine or her family to learn about the real world outside the 2005 dreamworld. Only outside actors, such as Mister Morgenstern, can do that.

11.  Mister Morgenstern made no bones to Lorraine that he can curtail the 2005 simulation and its trancelike effect, if offered a better deal. This rule was left unelaborated.  

“So,” my partner drawls, testing the waters in the wake of the stunned lull in the room, “you are confessing to killing your children as well?”

I shoot Dee a look but without too much heat. Admittedly, if there were ever a time to jump on that, it’s now.

But, twisting her lips lopsided, Lo seems to consider this for a moment, visibly leaning toward the negative. “No. Not this time,” she says.

Then something odd happens. Lo glances up at me from the table, and when she does, her face blanches, her eyelids peeling back in sheer terror. It’s brief, and never revisited, but I catch it none the less. I look about me, finding no one else and nothing out of place in the room. I then notice her refraining from looking at me, instead confining her gaze to the table. I realize then that’s she become terrified of me. But what for? Is there some evil, leering monkey on top of my head or something? Despite feeling like a horse’s ass, I pat my spiky scalp to check.

“But, again,” I hear my partner’s voice, “you have no idea where Jennifer and Tobias are at this time?”

“I said that” Lo snaps. She is now making eye contact with Dee – making her the lead interviewer. And she’s giving me the cold shoulder. What the hell just happened?

Sensing this interview is now taking a nosedive into the Bizarro realm, I paused the tape recorder and ask Lo if she wants something to eat. A small reward for her cooperation so far. And anyway, we have what we wanted: a confession to the murder. Plus, the longer this interrogation drags on, the less convincing it will look to a jury. We can always circle back to the kids later.

Lo asks Dee for Eggs Benedict, naming a few specialty restaurants in Aakoziwin I’ve never heard of that apparently serve the dish all day. We get her to settle for coffee and a breakfast sandwich from Burger King.

We’re about to leave the room when she starts crying again. Bawling this time. And I mean loud. Wailing like a banshee. The sound of her high-pitched sobs still keeps me up some nights.

“You’re all dead, don’t you understand? You’re all empty holographs in my world.” She says this, perforating her howls and babbling with her unintelligible speech. “I’m the only sentient being in this room. The rest of you are just shadows. You’re walking around dead and not knowing it.”

Dee and I both pivot back, anxious to console her. To try to use this opportunity to coax a further confession. We have enough to charge her with murder one, but we don’t want to blow our chance at finding out what happened to the kids. This could be our opening.

“Take it easy, Lo,” says Dee, awkwardly placing her hand on the perp’s heaving shoulder. Like the two of them are now besties. “Just – just let it out.”

The howling stymies but the tears come down in sheets. Her whole body is trembling as if in spasmodic ecstasy. Like she’s having a seizure. Neither of us notice that Lo’s hair is now somewhat disheveled, or that she’s began retracting the metal pins from her tight auburn bun.

“I-I couldn’t stop it,” she mewls, her voice catching on each syllable. “I couldn’t stop it.”

Seizing on the opportunity, I ask, “You couldn’t stop what? What couldn’t you stop, Lo?”

“The time,” she croaks, her tears still rolling. “I couldn’t stop the time and the marring trudge of my life. I made that deal – that deal with Morgenstern to keep my family – to keep Jennifer. And now they’re all gone and I’m stuck here. And the cruel irony is that if I hadn’t made the deal, I’d have at least had thirty years with them still in my world. But I didn’t see it. I was so blind. So Goddamn blind!”

She then pitches forward, throwing herself on top of the table and jamming her hands into her falling face, her hair mushrooming into a wild mane. I first dismiss this as an ostentatious show of grief until I hear the otherworldly scream of pain. Until I see the blood pooling on the beechwood tabletop. She rears back, revealing she’s punctured both eyes, using her vintage metal hairpins like bayonets. Lo sits there, writhing, swaying, bleeding, and shrieking like some grotesque casualty of war. Her eyes gushing maroon like a pair of sliced pomegranates.

“Jesus Christ!” Dee exclaims, her hands now tight on Lo’s shoulder. “Call an EMT!” But before I can leave the box, I watch with stark horror as Clayborn grabs a hold of Dee’s wrist, twists the arm downward, grasping until finding purchase, and pulls Dee’s face in close before biting Dee hard on the cheek as if she were a red delicious. Dee yelps and pulls backward but is trapped in the blind creature’s clawing grip, crimson-dripping hands scratching Dee’s neck and yanking down her hair.

Reacting, I toss the table to the side, flipping it over – its titanium legs sticking up in the air – and rush toward the two women. I pound my forearm into the back of Clayborn’s neck. Stunned, she freezes, gasping for air like a fish out of water. Still seeing red, I fell her with a backhand, sending her to the floor, the bolted chair rattling in place in wake of the fall. Clayborn lies there, arms and legs in the air like an upturned beetle, the wind knocked out of her. The blunt ends of the embedded hairpins sticking out of her face like bloodied popsicle sticks.

Dee regains her bearings, and I can see her injuries aren’t so bad. A few scratches on the neck and chin, and purple teeth marks that will fade into negligible blemishes with time. Seeing the wrath in Dee’s face, I step back, letting her descend on that blind piece of shit and get her licks in. I pull her off before the whole thing becomes inadmissible.

While the EMTs are strapping Lorraine Clayborn, writhing and shrieking, to the gurney, Dee and I sit at our cubicles talking to Inspector Catney. Catney stands over us, his forearm lain on the cubicle wall, his laminated credentials hanging from his lanyard like a crucifix. Dee sits with ankles crossed, an icepack pressed to her gnarled cheek. She’s already shooed off the medics who have begged her to go to the hospital. Dee acquiesces in applying a disinfectant cream to the lacerated area, promising to see a doctor whenever possible. In an attempt at levity, I suggest she get a rabies shot. No one laughs.

“What are we thinking, you two?” asks Catney, arms crossed over his bloated gut, staring down at us over black framed spectacles.

“I say we got everything we need, boss,” I answer, jumping at the opportunity to speak before my partner can. “She confessed to killing her husband and the toxicology report will back us if she welches.”

“No,” Dee demurs, removing the icepack and inspecting it. “Those kids are still out there. No one can confirm their whereabouts. I say we get her back in the box and press her. We need to find Jennifer and Tobias.”

“She admitted to killing the kids, Dee. That’s what the cyanide-tainted coco was about.”

“No. Remember? She said, ‘Not this time.’ You yourself saw that those mugs were untouched, both filled to the brim with Swiss Mix. No, those kids are alive. We need to find them.”

“We won’t find them through Clayborn, Dee. We got to take the win and move on. And if they’re alive, we kick it over to Missing Persons; they can find the kids through another avenue.”

Behind us, Clayborn is being wheeled away, screaming at the top of her lungs: “You’re all dead! You’re cadavers dancing on marionette strings. All hologram and shadows. Dead! DEAD!”

“We can break her,” says Dee, reapplying the icepack, sandwiching it in place with a hunched shoulder. “She admitted to killing her husband; she’ll tell us where the kids are.”

“She only confessed to killing her husband because she wanted to,” I respond, glowering at my partner. “You heard her in there, she knows all about our tricks. She didn’t do anything she didn’t want to.”

Catney grunts. “She did work out of the prosecutor’s office years back.”

“And what about that?” I ask. “Are we going to get jammed up on some backroom bullshit behind her working for the Crown?”

Catney shakes his head, smirking blackly. “I felt chain-of-command down on this one. The deputy himself told me what the Crown Attorney’s office told him: have at ‘er. Whatever connections that psycho may have had , they’ve long dried up.”

Tepid relief washing over me, I nod with a slight grunt. But looking over at Dee, I can tell she’s not satisfied.

“I still say we hold off on charging her with the husband’s murder,” she says. “Until she gives us a locale on the kids. We could even turn her loose and tail her.”

Catney balks, “Not in this life. You know protocol.”

“Let that psychopath loose?” I cry. “Have you lost your mind? And how in fuck are we supposed to tail her to her kids? I mean, were you not in the room with me just now? She’s blind.”

Abashed, Dee tucks her chin behind a hunched shoulder. “I mean, see who she contacts, get a wiretap on her cell phone. In her compromised state there’s even more reason now to let her think she’s free; she’s not able to hurt anyone. Besides, it sounds like she wouldn’t hurt her kids – she’d only hurt herself and her husband.”

“She told us she’d killed the kids a dozen times before.”

“Yeah, and she told us we’ve been in 2005 for the past decade. That she didn’t hurt them this time. She’s clown shoes, Tim.”

“Boss,” I say, turning to Catney for support, “we got to run with the confession she gave us and charge her. An educated woman like that? In no time at all she’ll lawyer up, change the narrative, make the confession seem like a wash. Shit, she’s already preparing for an insanity defense with that cockamamie story about Mister Morris-Berg and the time loop.”

“Morgenstern,” Dee corrects me.

“Whatever. That stunt with her eyes? She must have sharpened the ends of those pins like a shank knowing she’d use them like that once she got here. And speaking of being educated, she couldn’t help herself, could she?” I look up at Catney, an undefined smirk spreading across his bloodless lips. “I mean, come on, with that bit about not being able to change fate, killing her children after finding out her husband was leaving her for another woman, then blinding herself like that? She would have made Freud proud.”

Dee knits her brow, swiveling her head around like it’s on a spoke from Catney to me. “What?” she sputters. “Freud? Blinding herself? Fate? What are you even talking about?”

“The Greek Tragedies, Donkey Kong. Sophocles? Oedipus Rex? Medea? What’s the matter? All those online Women’s Studies classes and you never learned the classics?”  

Catney and I both chuckle at Dee’s gawking expense.

Galled, she opens her mouth to speak then thinks better of it, see my staying upturned hand accompanied by a few lethargic nods. I knew she was about to remind me that she’s not taking an online course but instead attending night school. And that she isn’t enrolled in Gender Studies or Women’s Studies, but Psychology, hardly irrelevant to the Job. Of course, I didn’t find out about her extracurricular studies from her puffing out her chest on it either but had wheedled it out of her after word of it got around the department. Still, I can’t ever resist busting her chops.

“All right,” says Catney, the smile gone from his lopsided mouth as though it were never there. “I’ll call the Crown Attorney; tell her we’re charging the bitch with murder one. As far as the missing kids, you two shake that tree for all its worth and see what falls out. But if we don’t have a line on them by Monday, or before a possible press conference, you both go back on rotation.”

He then turns and saunters off toward his office.

A press conference seems unlikely; it is just one murder. Still, you never know. These things tend to sprawl. To take on a life of their own.

Dee slumps in her chair, the icepack now bagged milk in her hand.

Content but exhausted, I ease myself vertical then head to the men’s room to splash water on my face.

My eyes burny, my chest tight from Lorraine Clayborn’s howls, I wash my face and stand erect above the basin, waiting for the throbbing to pass.

I look up, expecting the same haggard horseface staring back at me that I’d seen that morning while brushing my teeth. Instead, beyond the glass, stands a gawking, livid cadaver. I only see it for a split second but the details sear themselves into my brain: the flesh grey and torn, large gashes revealing bone and wriggling maggots; the worst part being the missing mandible, giving the corpse a gaping, cavernous look of interminable longing. Like it needs to say something but can’t – must speak but can’t make itself understood! Another morbidly remarkable feature is the one empty eye socket, the rim around the hole charred black like cinder. Black as the darkness beyond the small portal in the skull. My heart punching through my chest, I scrunch my eyes closed and shake my head like a dog. When I reopen them, everything is back to normal – my drawn, bucktoothed mug, with both eyes and skin still attached, hanging above my withered collar, staring back at me wide-eyed behind the smudged, water-spotted mirror.

Lorraine’s sudden rebuff of my presence flashes in my mind. Her look of surprise and disgust, as though something had suddenly changed. Had she seen it too? I then recall rule 4 of her 2005 dreamworld: When a person dies outside the dreamworld, their image will still appear, but this may cause problems – distortions or glitches in the hologram. Her last screaming indictment then dins inside my skull: *You’re all dead. Dead holograms walking around and not knowing it. Just* [*shadows.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/malcolmmacdonaldfic/)
