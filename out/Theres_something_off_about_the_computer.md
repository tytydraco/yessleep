*Yawning*

&#x200B;

(That was a nice cup of coffee… break is over, time to go back to work.)

&#x200B;

\- Hey, buddy… who’s a good boy? Who’s a good boy? You are a good boy!  (We gotta take you to the vet, it’s been a while… you also need a bath, stinky… see ya later…)

&#x200B;

(Huh? That’s odd, I don’t remember opening the Word… it’s a blank document… hmm… maybe it’s a bug, or I’m going crazy. Anyway, back to work…)

&#x200B;

**2 hours later**

&#x200B;

(I gotta go to the toilet…) (Aahhh… sweet relief…) (Huh? Why is he barking?)

&#x200B;

*Barking*

&#x200B;

\- JAMIE!? SHUSH!

&#x200B;

(I better check in on him…) (What are you doing in my office buddy? You know you’re not allowed here… and why are you barking at the comp…)

&#x200B;

(What the… it’s the damn Word document again? Is it a vírus? Shit, I better contact the IT department… also, let me cover the camera…) 

&#x200B;

(Huh? It’s not responding… but it’s not frozen as well, the cursor just keeps blinking… I think I’ll restart it.) (Yep, not working… what if I cut the power supply?)

&#x200B;

(Oh, good… let me turn it on again.) (Yep, it seems about right, but I’ll contact the IT guys anyway.)

&#x200B;

**15 minutes later**

&#x200B;

(Well, they told me there’s nothing wrong with it… so, let me get back to work, then…)

&#x200B;

**2 hours later**

&#x200B;

*Doorbell rings*

&#x200B;

(The doorbell? Who could it be? Huh? There’s no one out there… no packages either.) (Shame… I thought it was my new headset…) (Back to work…)

&#x200B;

\- Nah, you must be kidding me… no, no, no, the file even has a something written on it now…

&#x200B;

`“Don’t...”`

&#x200B;

(What the hell is that supposed to mean?) (I can’t close it, again, those IT guys are fucking worthless, let me call Anna…)

&#x200B;

*Dials up*

&#x200B;

\- Hey, Anna, it’s me… yeah, I’m good… listen, my computer, I mean, the company’s computer isn’t working properly, there’s something off about it…

&#x200B;

(What? `“Don’t talk about it.”`? okay, that’s freaking me out…)

&#x200B;

\- Huh? Yep, yeah, still here, sorry, I’m just wondering if you could ask for a replacement for me and if I could use my personal computer for the rest of the day…

&#x200B;

\- Yeah, I know about the company's policy, but I can’t work, are you giving me the rest of the day off?

&#x200B;

\- Yeah, thought so… ok… thanks, see ya later.

&#x200B;

*Turns off*

&#x200B;

(Okay, bye-bye you creep… )

&#x200B;

(Finally some peace…)

&#x200B;

What the fuck? `“Well done.”`?

&#x200B;

(I can’t believe it’s happening on this one as well…) (Let me call Michael…)

&#x200B;

*Dials up*

&#x200B;

\- Hey, honey… how’s your day going?

&#x200B;

\- Oh, great, babe, I’m glad for you… listen, are you coming home anytime soon? There’s something off about the computers in here… I’m getting scared.

&#x200B;

`“I warned you.”`

&#x200B;

\- Honey, please just come home? Thanks… see you soon…

&#x200B;

*Dog crying*

&#x200B;

\- Jamie?? (Why is he crying?)

&#x200B;

\- What’s going on buddy? (I better check out on him…) (Huh? It’s locked… what the fuck it’s not supposed to be locked…)

&#x200B;

\- HEY! IS ANYONE THERE???

&#x200B;

(I’ll call Michael again…)

&#x200B;

(What, no service?) (I’ll try WhatsApp…) (Why isn’t working, I have the Wi-Fi… No, I don’t??)

&#x200B;

(I gotta get out of here… but it’s the second floor, maybe I should wait for Michael…)

&#x200B;

*Windows slam shut*

&#x200B;

\- AAAHH!! (Oh fuck, what was that?) 

&#x200B;

*Struggles*

&#x200B;

(I can’t open them, they’re jammed…) (What is this smell? Is it a fire?)

&#x200B;

\- HELLO!! IS ANYBODY THERE???

&#x200B;

`“There’s no one there, not anymore.”`

&#x200B;

\- What the fuck did you do?

&#x200B;

\- JAMIE?? COME HERE! JAMIE, WHERE ARE YOU, BOY??

&#x200B;

(Huh? What’s that on the floor? WHAT? Is that… blood coming from outside?) (I’ll look underneath the door…)

&#x200B;

\- WHAT? NOO!! JAMIEEE???

&#x200B;

\- YOU SICK FUCK!!!!

&#x200B;

\- Come on boy, get up, I’m right here… Mommy is coming for you!

&#x200B;

\- FUCK!! GODDAMN DOOR!!!!

&#x200B;

`“I told you to not talk about it.”`

&#x200B;

\- FUCK YOU!! See how you like that, ASSHOLE!!!

&#x200B;

*Computer crashes through the window*

*The company’s computer turns on*

&#x200B;

(It’s the damn Word document again… what does it say now?)

&#x200B;

`“Are we getting violent now?”`

&#x200B;

(What do you mean now? You fucking killed my dog, psycho)

&#x200B;

*Lights turn off*

*Only the white Word screen shines in the darkness*

*Blood keeps leaking inside*

*The smell of fire is getting stronger*

*The closet door creaks as it opens slowly in the darkness*

&#x200B;

(Oh my god!? What do I do... What do I do?) (Right, what if I answer it?)

&#x200B;

*Typing noises*

&#x200B;

`“There's no need to get violent, I’m sorry!”`

&#x200B;

*The creaking door stops*

&#x200B;

`“You got me angry, though, now someone has to die.”`

&#x200B;

*Typing noises*

&#x200B;

`“Please, no one has to die, can't you just forgive, me? I just got scared”`

&#x200B;

*Silent typing*

&#x200B;

`"That was the whole point."`

&#x200B;

\- BABE!! - *Michael yells as he bangs at the door*

&#x200B;

\- OH MY GOD! BABE, WHAT HAPPENED TO JAMIE?? THE KITCHEN IS ON FIRE, WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!!! - *Michael yells*

&#x200B;

\- I CAN’T, THE DOOR IS LOCKED, I CAN’T GET OUT!!

&#x200B;

`“You must choose, or both of you are dying.”`

&#x200B;

\- I’LL BARGE IN, TAKE A STEP BACK!! - *Michael yells*

&#x200B;

\- Babe, it’s to late… I’m sorry, I love you…

&#x200B;

*The closet’s doors starts slowly creaking again*

&#x200B;

\- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, DIANA?? WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!! - *Michael yells as he keeps trying to barge in*

&#x200B;

*Diana types, as a tear rolls down through her face*

&#x200B;

`"..."`

&#x200B;

*Silent typing*

&#x200B;

`“Good girl.”`
