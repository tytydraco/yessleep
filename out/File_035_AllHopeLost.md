Frankly, I have lost track of how long it has been since that day. That cursed day that truly made my life a living hell,The day I lost my own son.

The main thing I can tell anyone reading this is the fact that exactly three weeks after he went missing, My wife left me. I don’t blame her however, as this, was in all honesty. My fault, and I’m not blaming anyone but myself.

A man does not feel true pain until his motivation to get up in the morning, his jewel to protect, his love, and his safety is gone in the blink of an eye.

To leave out some of the sentimental details as it is hard enough writing this. Those who follow, I thank you, you are all caught up to what happened. Tho those who aren’t, I am..well was a therapist. During the span of 6 months I kept getting patients who talked about a cavern on a farm. I say about 6 miles out from where I personally reside in my home.

The cavern seems not to be the simple go in, see graffiti, condoms, beer bottles, and trash strewn about it, no. What I am about to tell you is a key bit of information, as those who told me their story,either ended up missing, in a mental health hospital on suicide watch, or worse, committing suicide all due to whatever the hell goes on in there.

The best thing I can tell you about the farm and land in general is that it was built in the 1800s, by god knows who because whoever wrote the infographic about the land, took all the information they could about it out of the summary.

Nonetheless, during my time in solitary confinement of a computer screen and cheap alcohol to drown out my pain. I decided that it was finally time to go myself.

I mean hell, I’ve lost everything due to this damn place,so why shouldn’t I? I was too much of a pussy to go see if my own son was there when he went missing. The least I could do is give myself reassurance on the death of my own blood. I owe it to Stephen.

I decided that I would head out the following night as to not cause too much attention to myself. The local police after my wife’s call have decided to close off most of the entrances.

I am prepared to the best of my ability though, this time has not been for nothing.

Okay, it’s coming up on..8:15 pm. I’ve done enough procrastinating over if I have what I need. It’s time to settle this once and for all.

The drive took me about 35 minutes, as I started closing in on my point of interest, I was greeted by honestly a very disappointed sight.

A dull blood red barn started getting bigger in my vision as I got closer to it I could tell how old and run down this land truly is. Paint had chipped off of it to the point to where if it wasn’t for the few strips going down the sides of the entrance no one could not even tell that this barn was painted to begin with.

I pulled into the driveway and a knot grew in my stomach, the feeling I got pulling in was so bad that I really thought I was gonna throw up. Part of me questioned is this even worth it as I left my car running, i quickly put it in park and rested my head on my steering wheel.

I checked my watch and saw that it was already 9:15pm. If I was gonna go in, now was the time to do it. With a deep sigh, I put my car into drive, pulled behind the barn, and shut off my vehicle.

I got out, popped the trunk, and double checked everything in my backpack, rope, a handgun, three flashlights, my notebook that I had taken note into after reviewing my past recordings to get a insight to the layout of the cave, a few energy bars, and a thermos of water. 

I slid the backpack on and started my journey to the base of the mountain. Actually looking at it, it seemed monstrous in size, truth be told, it was intimidating. 

The hike up the mountain was a tedious one but I finally made it to I say about a 8 foot entrance blocked off by a bright yellow tape that read “CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS”.

I slid my backpack off my to hang on the crevice of my elbow and pulled out a flash light. I clicked it on, pulled the tape up and proceeded to this dark abyss.

I was instantly greeted by a faint and quiet dripping sound and a sweet yet, sour smell upon entering. Besides my flashlight I was engulfed in complete darkness.

I started peering my flashlight around and I froze where I stood. About 6 feet away from me, I soon felt a wave of dread as I saw three human made deep dark passages that ran a chill down my spine.

I shined my flashlight in them one by one, that was to no avail as the only thing I could see is the side walls and more darkness. I questioned how deep this cave actually ran and how far the police investigated without finding a trace of anything.

My fate laid before me, which passage way do I take? Thinking back to what my clients told me, I decided to choose the middle one. With a prayer I quietly and carefully treaded in.

Nothing notable happened for the first what seemed to be hundred feet, the squeak of bats and song of the water dripping was my only company. I was fine with that fact though, as, it let me know, even if it was an animal. I was not alone in this journey.

After about 40 minutes of walking I truly wondered how long and deep this went. I was looking around trying to find any clues and then…that’s when, I saw a small object in the distance. I placed one hand on my gun quickly and treaded forward.

As the object became clearer I realized it was a shoe. Worry plagued my mind as I started making a faster jog to investigate it, my only thought was my son. coming up on it it was a converse sneaker.

I picked it up and instantly checked the size “men’s 11, women’s 12.5”. It was not my sons size, this didn’t ease my mind though as I wondered what the hell happened to make a person lose something so needed this deep into the cave.

I peered my flashlight deeper into the cave and if I had to use the restroom at all, I would’ve. A dark burgundy stain about 35 maybe 40 inches across laid on the cave floor and stretched deep into the cave into darkness.

I instantly pulled out my gun and…didn’t move. Truth be told, fear had me in a vice grip, it took me a moment to even realize I was shaking myself. I did not want to go deeper into this situation, but, I had gotten this far. I can’t back out, I won’t allow myself to.

I am not religious in the slightest but at that moment I prayed. Slowly taking steps and looking behind me every five steps, I followed the trail. The trail didn’t go on for long as when it stopped, I was greeted with an open area the size of a small football stadium. I walked slowly, peering around stunned at how someone could actually make something this quintessential.

Let alone, how big this was, someone, or something, had a lot of time on it hands. As I started making my way slowly to the center. I was lost in the pure amazement of what was before my eyes. That’s when, I stopped and stood like a statue. In a sequence, multiple touches started to light on their own. One by one, going in a perfect circle until one was left. This is the moment, I knew, i was about to meet the one that caused all of my pain and suffering.
