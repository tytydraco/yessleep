Hey ya’ll! I have an online presence that is gaining traction (finally!). I have a lifestyle and fitness YouTube channel and Instagram and I mess around on TikTok a bit. Between the three I have a, let's say, sizable and growing online following. People like me because I keep it real and I keep it honest. My smoking hot sports bra and tiny gym shorts selfies don’t hurt either, I’m sure.  I don’t like to use soft language and worry about people’s fragile feelings all the time. Most of my followers love it, but because it’s the internet, the haters gotta hate. 

Normally I’d link my socials anywhere (growth is all about finding opportunities!) but I think I’ll hold off for now. You’ll see why. You all can call me Lily. 

Haters are always a part of the game, I’m pretty familiar with jealous bitches, but this year has been rough on me and I’m just more emotionally susceptible to negative energy right now. I feel like I need to give this context for this all to make sense of why I think one of the haters is a stalker and even a killer. I’ve lost five people close to me this year, one ex-boyfriend, two friends, my grandma and my therapist. I’ve been really sad about it. I even had to miss this big conference I was supposed to be a speaker at because of my grandma dying and it’s all just been a struggle. 

I started out 2025 on such a high note. I began dating this guy, very hot, totally one of the 6’5”, blue eyes, works in finance types. I thought he and I were on the same page. We both really valued and centered ambition, drive, goal setting, and most importantly, goal achieving. That’s what my internet profile is all about. I really think that we as a society are getting too soft. Everything is about work-life balance and resting and validating everyone’s feelings, even when they are bad takes or when their “me” time is quickly outpacing any kind of productivity. People don’t understand the rush of pushing through, even when it’s hard, even when you don’t want to. It’s all about instant gratification and excuses that people dress up as legitimate, like “mental health” and “being in the moment” or whatever. But that’s how you end up fat and broke. It might sound harsh, but it’s true. The truth hurts sometimes. 

Anyway, he was all about gains maxing and his LinkedIn followers. Kind of different from me but definitely similar vibes. We started working out every morning at this cute gym, pretty expensive, but totally worth it for the great spa set up, which turned out to not be so great for him. After the gym we would get green smoothies and spend some time on our laptops, sending emails, updating our socials, whatevs. It sounds mundane but I really could feel it, the connection, the synergy between us. We were so on the same wavelength it wasn’t hard to envision the empire we would build together. 

He would get wealthier and wealthier clients, his income would grow, he’d invest well. My already growing online presence would skyrocket once I was in some more aspirational backgrounds; pilates on a Maldives overwater bungalow, cooking a beautiful zero processed, entirely whole foods, protein packed recipe in a kitchen that gleamed and sparkled in a way that can only be achieved with a full time cleaning staff. 

As I stared at him across the table, his face focused, eyes flashing rapidly across his screen as he read through the comments on his most recent post, I felt it burning in my skin, a kind of itch just beneth the surface. Excitement, the opportunities opening up, the potential, the awesome possibilities glowing brighter and brighter in my mind, a blooming flower made of light so powerful I gasped and had to close my eyes. 

He asked me if I was okay but I was so overcome I could only nod. 

We went on like this for a couple more days, I was practically euphoric, but then one morning I was running a few minutes late. It wasn’t my fault. I had a stupid fight with my neighbor who doesn’t know when to shut up (long story!) and what do I see when I walk in? Him flirting away with the slut at the front desk. 

I know what I got and I don’t tolerate any kind of games, so I knew it was over at that moment. I felt all of that euphoria, that vision of that bright future go up in flames until it lay in my dark mind like a curled ember.  I had burned again, for him, but not with love. 

I don’t mind saying the truth in public, I’m not shy. But I also have class, so I just walked right past them, not making eye contact with him, and left through the other exit. He seemed to get the message, but I couldn’t know for sure because I blocked him on everything. He wasn’t worth the energy to explain anything to. 

Because I blocked him, it wasn’t until I went back to the gym (at a different time than our usual morning spot) like a week later that I learned from a different front desk person that the spa part was closed indefinitely because, get this, my ex slipped in the sauna and bashed the back of his head against the sauna stove! He apparently bled a lot. Gallons and gallons. He obviously didn’t make it. Any time they tried to turn the heat back on in there, it still smelled like blood, so they had to do a deep clean of the whole venting system, or something. 

I told this crazy story to my followers across all my platforms and most of the comments were about how terrible that was and were wishing me well and saying how sorry they were for me. It even went a little viral, definitely more views than I usually get, at least. But like a monkey’s paw wish, higher viewership means more asshole comments. I’ll just copy the first exchange with this weirdo below (username changed, obvs): 

**StalkerWeirdoFreak**: Did you kill him?

**Me**: Ummmmmm…. No? Why would you even say that?

**StalkerWeirdoFreak**: Just cuz you seem kind of off and he had just pissed you off, so, ya know. 

**Me**: That’s messed up. You’re messed up. 

**StalkerWeirdoFreak**: Was that the gym on \[Street Name\] and \[Street Name\]? 

I responded, totally pissed he just tried to dox me, he responded with some more BS about why they thought I killed him, the other commenters jumped in to defend me. It was a mess. But isn’t that so creepy? I didn’t confirm he got the gym right, obviously, but he totally had! I couldn’t go back to that gym and it was a stupid hassle canceling the membership. 

But part of what I always talk about on my platforms is that you can’t let the past slow you down, you can’t let inconveniences or worries stop you from doing what you want to do. I also really value positivity, so even though this was all an ordeal, I decided to see the silver lining in all of this. My subs and viewership numbers had a marked rise because of all of this and I really think that got the ball rolling on my current momentum. 

I think that if there is very little positivity to be had in your life, you have to make it yourself. What I like to do is go to the foothills of the nearby mountains and run along this one path. It goes through this pine tree forest, around a small lake, and then, my favorite part, it opens up to this amazing view of the city, just stunning. There are all these pine trees just behind you, sloping up for what feels like forever, and down below are steep cliffs to a valley of stones and sagebrushes.  The city sits in view of the valley opening, this shimmering thing, haze and heat making it seem like a mirage most of the time, not quite real. It looks huge but also small enough to fit into my hand, depending on perspective. Sometimes I hold my hand out and line it up so that it looks like it’s resting on my palm. 

I like to imagine what it would be like to have it really there. I imagine slowing tilting and titling it so that the tall gleaming building sway and start to bend and break and all the tiny tiny people start to slip and slide and scream. Scream so loud in terror that even I can hear them from so far above them. They plead and cry, but I can’t really make out their words. Their words don’t really matter, only mine do. I like to hold that moment, I like to really be in it. I like not knowing if I will close my hand and turn them to dust or if I will tilt my palm all the way and watch them fall into nothingness or if I will pull it back up, just right, and hear their sobs of relief and feel so great, so merciful, for righting their world back to normalcy. 

That light in that spot is amazing for selfies too. A lot of people like to take selfies on hikes or in the wilderness to make it look like they really exercise, but a lot of them don’t. I really do. I like to run and run until I can taste the blood in the back of my throat and my muscles throb in time with my heartbeat. It calms me. So this lighting is really good at hiding how red my face is. I also use a really subtle filter. Nothing fake, just to help. 

I was up there taking selfies when I started getting a lot of messages in the group chat. I was friends with these two girls, Jamie-Lynn and Marrissa. Jamie-Lynn was a raw vegetarian and Marrissa was a nutritionist turned life coach. They were both so beautiful, not just in appearance, but in their efforts, their carefully framed photos, their daily post schedules, their comment engagement. It really seemed like they were walking their talk. 

They started DMing me even though they had slightly bigger platforms because they could tell I’m going to be big. They were already close friends and they collaborated all the time. They messaged me first together and then had me join this bigger chat.   

The chat was with all the other up and coming health and wellness gurus in the area. They wanted to make a community. I also think some of them were trying to sell stuff sometimes? Like an MLM? But I was so ready to network and mingle when I first got in. I was excited to join because I’ve always said that you are who you hang around. Your friends, the quality and connection of your friends, makes all the difference in the life you’ll have. Unfortunately, like is often the case when you get a group of women together, it turns into mean girl high school cliques all over again. I couldn’t even guess how many sub group chats there are, splintering away to talk about someone else in their little group. The chat didn’t have a lot of going on in it often, so I was surprised at it going off like that. 

Guys. When I opened it, omg, the drama. Jamie-Lynn and Marrissa were talking mad shit, just stiring the pot. People were responding, others were jumping in when it wasn’t even about them. Long story short, somehow I got dragged into it. While I was standing there on that mountain, I was typing away, trying to keep grounded and truthful. Honestly, I was proud of how I was comporting myself, even though those two bitches turned on me. 

It just sucked. It’s not that I don’t think being likable is important but everyone in that chat was so fake and not even really trying to hide it . They all have their rich dads or rich sugar daddies or rich husbands, so they just take Ozempic and have a trainer and get so much filler and botox you could bounce a quarter of their faces, and they go around pretending to know everything. I had stayed friendly, I really had, kept my tone light, but they were all so sensitive. I think that they’re all so fragile because they know that they didn’t really earn any of this. Their  whole lives are built like a stack of cards, their egos made of papier mache, so it was easy, so easy, to crumple them. You didn’t even have to try all that hard. 

Anyway, I calmly finished my run and left the group chat and blocked them all. Who wants to be in that kind of environment? 

I told my followers all about it, of course, naming names and showing receipts once I felt okay enough about it all to talk about it like a week later. And who should show up again even though I blocked him last time? You guessed it, StalkerWeirdoFreak. He came back under a different user name, not that different though. He clearly wants me to know it’s him. I’ll just copy over what he said again: 

**StalkerWeirdoFreak1:** I was kind of kidding before, but are you actually a murderer? This is getting weird. 

**Me**: What are you talking about?

**StalkerWeirdoFreak1:** Jamie-Lynn and Marrissa are dead, they died two days ago in a car accident. Here’s an article. 

For a second, my vision went sort of dark, I was so shocked. I thought I might have to take my video down out of, like, respect for the dead, but this was by far the most engagement and views I’ve gotten in awhile, so I really, really didn’t want to. But I also didn’t want to get cancelled. I really didn’t know what to do. The weirdo went on about how the police were looking into it as a suspicious death, that maybe someone messed with the car’s mechanics, I don’t know. I don't know anything about cars. 

Apparently they couldn’t brake or turn and they went into a ditch and then into a field, the cute little convertible an unfortunate choice, as they ran into a wire fence and were decapitated. Apparently the scene was very disturbing. The wire went right into their necks, making it nice, even cuts, very clean. If it wasn’t for the just buckets of blood and their heads resting neatly beside them rather than on top of their necks, you wouldn’t have thought much of the crash. The rest of the damage was minimal.   

The whole time Weirdo is talking about all this, I’m just watching the comments, biting my fingernails. I want to know if people think I should take it down, if they’ll make me take it down. 

Some people thought I should, but the best thing happened. The video went viral, actually viral! People are wondering if someone in the group chat could have done it. Some people join the weirdo in accusing me, but most of them think it’s somebody else in the chat. I wouldn’t have brought it up if it had been me, right? 

People are so interested, it spreads and spreads. Clips from my video are showing everywhere. Those true crime freaks are all about it. 

I block the weirdo again, but what gets me is this. Not only did he make an alt account to contact me again, which is harassment, he mentioned in his ranting and raving that the field they died on was close to where I live. 

Close. to. where. I. live. 

How does he know where I live? Does he actually know or is he saying that to get attention? I mean, he’s right, it did happen pretty close to me, but did he actually know that or was he just saying that to mess with me, taking a wild guess to make his accusation more plausible? 

Y’all, I really thought about moving. How messed up is that? First my boyfriend dies, then my two closest friends and now because of some loser, I might have to move? How is that fair? 

It’s not fair. I decided to not do it. But I think that was a mistake. 

A few months later, my grandma came to visit me. She’s old fashioned, very religious, but not all that old, very spry, in shape, still pretty scary. She had a gray bob, cut short. She would have looked a lot younger if she had dyed it, but she said that's vanity. She always wore muted colors and modest clothes and just was so judgmental. Any girl showing a shoulder was a temptrest, a slut.  

She had my mom young. Her husband, my grandpa, was much older than her. I don’t remember him well. He’s just this figure rising above me in my memories I’m not even sure are real; tall, brown trousers held up by crossed blue suspenders, like he was from a different era, a different time and place, his face in dark shadow. I can still smell the shoe polish. My grandma said she polished his shoes every day because women are responsible for how their men look, that they have to be tamed to behave. 

My mom had me young too, out of wedlock. My grandparents were very ashamed, but they shouldn’t be. I have a glow about me. I have an it factor. They just didn’t know the blessing they received from my existence. 

My grandpa died when I was young. My dad was never in the picture. My grandma helped raise me. It’s all kind of sad, kind of a typical from the middle nowhere Ohio story. Which is why my grit, my capabilities, my natural charm makes me a real pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps sort of story. That’s why I’m special. Those other girls, they just have it given to them. Not me. Never me. 

Anyway, I didn’t like it when my grandma visited. She made me feel small. And she was coming right around when I was going to go to that big influencer conference in my city. I was going to speak there. I didn’t want to feel small before going there. But it’s not like she ever listened to what I wanted. She was coming when she wanted to come and I better prepare my bedroom for her and get ready to sleep on the couch for the few days she visited. 

Fine. Fine. 

Everybody, it wasn’t fine. But that’s not what I’m writing about. We don’t need to get into the nitty gritty of my family dynamics, right? I’m only bringing it up because I want you all to understand that I had to get away from her. I needed her to leave me alone. I knew she was leaving the next day but it wasn’t soon enough. I wanted her away from me. To be gone from me. As a rather bright suggestion, if I do say so myself, I said she should pray while going on a hike. I told her my favorite path. 

And I won’t lie. Some part of me daydreamed that she would slip, that she would fall down into that rocky valley. I didn’t think she actually would. It took the rescue workers two tries to get all of her back up. She shattered like a ceramic doll, an arm here, a leg there. 

I won’t bore you all with everything that followed. The police, the attorneys, all the questions, so many questions. But it all went away eventually. Eventually, I had time to center myself again. Rather than feeling grief, I felt that silver lining. 

I was finally free. Maybe that’s not how you’re supposed to feel about it. Maybe that’s too dark for some of you. But it is how I felt. I went back to the path a month after her death and I didn’t have the urge to put the city in my palm again. Instead I looked up into the clear blue sky and felt like I was flying, flying so high. I stretched out my arms and they became giant golden wings, bigger than the mountain, and I flew above the city, so small I knew that I could reach down with one heel and crush it all. But I didn’t want to. I didn’t feel like I had to. 

I went home feeling good. Really good. Until I went online. There he was again. 

I hadn’t told my followers very much about my grandmother’s death. I knew I wouldn’t be able to hit the right tone about it authentically, so I just posted one picture of her wreath at her sparsely attended funeral (my mom didn’t even show), said some generic caption and went dark for a couple of weeks. But when I went to my Insta, weirdly the photo had a lot of traction, a lot of comments. One of the commenters was, of course: 

**1StalkerWeirdoFreak:** Your own grandmother? Really? I’m gathering evidence on you. I didn’t want you to know because I wanted you to continue to act crazy so I could get you, but now I’m letting you know because I want you to, ya know, stop killing people. 

**Me**: How fucking dare you. 

**1StalkerWeirdoFreak:** Don’t play indignant. I saw you walking to that path with your grandma and only you coming back, I have proof. It was the \[Trialhead Name\], right? Right? Why don’t you just go turn yourself in now, you sick monster. 

I turned off my phone. I went to my window blinds and closed them. I sat in the middle of my living room. You all, of course, know that that wasn’t true. I mean, I did walk with my grandma to the path to show her where it was, so I’m sure that the stalker had a photo of me going there with her and then leaving without her, but that doesn’t prove anything. I had already told the police about it. He didn’t have shit. But for some reason this, more than him knowing about my gym or at least the area I lived, this felt more personal. The path is mine. My safe place. How could he know? How could he show up there? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? How dare he? 

Anyway, this was a real low point for me, especially after I had been feeling so high. This is also the first time that it occurred to me that maybe Weirdo stalker was the killer? Do you all think that’s possible? He knew all about those deaths, every single one. He knows so much about me. Some people on the internet, they get twisted, obsessed, you know? Maybe his obsession isn’t like a fan’s but instead something weirder. Maybe he wants to kill but frame me for the murders? 

It sounds kind of crazy, maybe far fetched, I don’t know. But think about it. He watched me leave me grandma on the path. Maybe he followed her in there? Maybe she didn’t slip at all and he pushed her? Maybe all of his accusations were actually confessions? 

At that point, I didn’t know. I just wasn’t sure. But now? Now I’m really thinking it might be the case. 

You see, this all was a few months ago. I ended up moving, which turned out to be great, a much better neighborhood. I was able to afford a better place because my views were higher, my subs were growing. I felt safer, too. I really took care to make sure that I wasn’t being followed to the new place, so I felt better. Secure. 

I decided I needed some therapy. I had so many losses this year, too many. And now a stalker accusing me of murder? It was too much. I really believe in self reliance, resilience and positivity. I think the whole mental health thing is way blown out of proportion and that most “depressed” people just need to get a couple of successes under their belt so that they don’t feel like such losers. 

But everybody has a therapist. All the other YouTubers talk about it. The therapists seem helpful sometimes. I also believe in using all the tools in your tool box to get the job done. Maybe the therapist could help with some of the simpler stuff I was struggling with? Every once in a while I feel pretty, I don’t know, out of it? Kind of like I’m playing the city on my palm game but I can’t quite snap out of it? Just sort of spacy, distracted, like I’m walking besides myself and nothing feels real? Sometimes I think everyone is an NPC. Sometimes I feel like if I reached out my hand would go right through people. Sometimes I imagine that the people in the coffee shop, the grocery store, the park next to me are actually made of clay, just golems with a simple word stuffed into their mouths, moving through life without all the complexities of real people. Sometimes when people walk past I want to take a knife and peel pieces of them off like chunks of clay, just hear the wet thud of the clay hit the ground, let it sit there until I can see it rejoin the earth. 

Anyway, I got a therapist, a man. I know most therapists are women, but I just never got along well with women for some reason, so I thought a dude would be better. He was great. It was the first time that I felt really heard in a long time. It was also the first time that I felt, like, respected by a guy? A lot of guys are pretty dismissive once I tell them what I do for a living, but he was really supportive. I liked him a lot. I wished he could just be my therapist, you know? But overall, it was a good experience. I wanted it to keep going, even if he had to listen to other people’s stupid problems, but. 

Guys, I’m being so for real right now. My therapist was stabbed to death. On Zoom. In front of his client. Maybe some of you guys have heard about it? I know it’s been on the news. Apparently the murderer was wearing all black and a ski mask and used a big kitchen knife. My therapist was in his living room when the client saw a dark figure moving up behind him. She warned him but by the time he turned his head to look, the murderer already stabbed him in the neck. There was so much blood. The client screamed and screamed, called 911 but didn’t know where to tell them to go, it’s not like therapists give you their addresses. 

So the murderer got away. 

In my DMs I got the messages, copied below. I think that this is it. I think this shows that he’s responsible. I think I’m in real danger. How would he know that this was my therapist otherwise? I think he’s hacked my computer? Maybe he's peaking through the windows? Maybe he’s in the house with me? What do you all think?

**Stalker1WeirdoFreak:** This has to stop. It has to stop. You have to stop. What I got last time wasn’t good enough, I admit it. But I got you now. I want you to know. I want you to feel just even a sliver of fear that you made all of those people you killed feel. 

**Stalker1WeirdoFreak:**  Oh, so you’re going to ignore me now? That’s all you got? Wait until you see what I have on you this time. I bet you thought you were being clever, didn’t you? Wearing gloves, wearing a mask? But I followed you there, all the way to his place. I saw you outside \[Therapist’s name\] door. I saw you wailing and crying outside of it, you fucking stalker weirdo freak. You fucking murderer. 

**Stalker1WeirdoFreak:** And it’s not just that you bitch. Just you wait. Just you wait. I’ve got you now.
