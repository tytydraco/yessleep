A red envelope was slid under my door. At 19:30 last night, to be exact. No stamp, no return address. Just my name written with a pen that never shook. Deep blue ink, first and last, pressed neatly against each other.

To make ends meet, I’ve done a variety of things. Anything I could think of to keep me off the streets. The skin-baring ways to get by. Scraping for coins at the corner of the street. Transforming ordinary junk into sad, subpar music instruments. Being spat and pissed on, a reject of society. A depressing and flimsy hat to catch change. Feeling humiliated and ignored. It was a humbling experience, to put it mildly. 

Poverty and addiction centered my life; the duty of survival was no stranger to me. No support system. No fair chance. It’s no wonder life ended up like this. A string of shoddy, vile motels and a diet consisting of dollar-store ramen. At least it was better than drifting between sidewalks and shelters. I’d been down that road. 

Now, as long as I can shoot, I wasn’t sleeping in the gutters. The shutter lagged, the lens was scratched and worn, but it still functioned. My camera: the only thing of value I have left. Everything else was rotten and grimed, never clean. Bundled into a small, beaten-down backpack. The only tether to a misshapen childhood I can’t seem to outgrow. 

Most days, I position myself on the busiest street of the city. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of strangers passing by. It was nothing great. It wasn’t art. Just street photography – faceless, frozen people. Capturing lives I’ll never have. I sell what I can for scraps. Just enough to get by.

The envelope sat there for a while – silent, bleeding red against the cheap laminate floor. I studied it quietly. Wondering where it came from, what it was doing here. A joke? Some sick prank? I was hesitant, careful. But the curiosity didn’t shake. It intensified, sharp and insistent. Every glance seemed to pull me deeper, like it knew I would cave. I circled it, bent down, and picked it up. Brushing over the paper, it was smooth. There was a small wax seal on the flap. 

Something about it felt wrong but not dangerous. Worse... *intentional*. Like the sender knew I couldn’t resist. My fingers hesitated, half-hoping I would stop, rip it, or throw it away. I didn’t. 

Inside was a small, brand-new 32 GB SD card. It was clean, untouched – almost sterile. Beneath it rested a single paper, folded. It resembled the same uncanny spotlessness. Folding the paper open, glazing my eyes over the text, my mind reeled with confusion. 

On it was a list. A simple list, five bullet points. Five timestamps. Formulated in the same unshaken technique. 

*“1. 11:36 PM: the woman with red hair at the Oak Street bus stop, carrying a shopping bag and a purse.* 

*2. 9:20 AM: the man with blonde hair in “Main Street Cuts” wearing a suit and boxy glasses.* 

*3. 00:45 AM: the old man with a brown hat and cane, standing on the corner of Maple Avenue and Lincoln Street.* 

*4. 3:07 PM: the man wearing a long, navy coat, pushing a stroller through the Willow Creek Park.* 

*5. 7:56 AM: the woman with blonde hair running in blue leggings and mustard yellow sweater, cutting the corner on Main Street.”*

On the bottom part was another block of text. I furrowed my brow.. “***RULES***”, it read. This time, the writing was messy, scolding, and stern.

*“****RULES***

* ***Always use the given SD card.***
* ***DO NOT differ from the prompts.***
* ***DO NOT tell anyone.*** 
* ***DO NOT be seen. Especially not by the subjects.***
* ***Upon completion, return the envelope containing the SD card to the third lightpost at the Fresh Fast Restaurant. You will know where to put it.***

***Breaking these rules will have consequences. The reward for completion is $200.”***

Folding the paper, I scoffed. This was absurd. Unfathomably absurd. I set the envelope down, revoltingly, almost like I would be poisoned at the touch. The next few hours were spent pacing back and forth in the room. Raking through every logical and illogical decision. 

The whole construct was beyond ridiculous, really. Photographing random individuals and somehow being paid $200. Crumbling and creasing the paper, I threw it in the trash. While frumpling the envelope to follow the letter’s way to the garbage, a sudden thought dawned on me. *My name.* 

A concept so mundane, you would never pay it a second thought. Mail, subscriptions, addresses, all connected to it. I glanced over it again, my head spinning and heart racing. A concept so mundane, yet I felt sick to my stomach reading it.

*“Jackson R.”*

Mind you, I haven’t used my real name in years.
