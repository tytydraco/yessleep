The bus stopped in front of an old house, which at first sight, I knew had a mysterious history. Ancient houses often evoke in our minds images of a forgotten past, and mine is no exception. This house, with its Victorian architecture, exudes a dark, strangely attractive beauty.

When I got out of the car, the cold autumn wind blew, carrying the scent of fallen dry leaves, and I felt an indescribable silence. The small dirt road leading to the house is surrounded by rows of tall trees, dense foliage blocking sunlight, creating a path full of darkness and mystery. In the cold air of the late afternoon, the house seemed to be waiting for someone to discover things that had been buried long ago.

The house stands tall in the middle of a large plot of land, with large windows that have become opaque with the dust of time. The paint on the wall has faded and peeled, revealing old wood, but it is this oldness that makes it more charming and mysterious. The sophisticated architectural lines are still there, even though they have been worn away by time, but the house still retains the majesty of a bygone golden age.

The huge oak main door with meticulously carved details evokes images of a bygone era when this house was probably the center of lavish parties. On the door there is a brass doorknob that has tarnished over the years. Its shape resembles a roaring lion, as if wanting to protect the secrets inside.

The walls are made of stone, covered with vines, creating a blue veil that covers the entire house. The windows have warped wooden frames and have cracked or broken glass panes, but it can still be seen that they were once expensive, carefully crafted glass panels.

I walked up the stone steps leading to the front door, each step creaking, as if the house was welcoming my presence, or maybe a warning of what was waiting. inside.
