The grey house always fascinated me. 

It stood in the corner of our neighbourhood, looking like it has been neglected for decades. Its walls were bruised and tattered. Its roof was only half-built, the cement rotting from within. Its sight gave me a sinking feeling, as if it was a glimpse of the suffering it has faced because of the elements. It had a yard, but it was swallowed almost entirely by dried weeds. They were pale, leafless, stock-still. 

The grey house was unsettlingly quiet, but it did not feel empty.

Walking across from it turned simple sounds like the wind, the screech of a bird, or someone’s footsteps into something suspicious. You couldn't help but stop and rake an eye over the crumbling structure- even if you knew nothing's in there-  just to make sure. It had always been the root cause of whispers all across the neighbourhood. 
But the exact cause of the paranoia, the goosebumps, the misery was unknown.

My parents forbade me from playing near it, but that only fed my curiosity. And that combined with the rush of bravado I had, the rebellion wasn't unexpected. 

I decided to explore the house with Issac. That summer we planned to enter the house, out of pure curiosity and hunger for adrenaline. We found a time when most neighbours were at work, and sped over to the house on our bicycles. The excitement that flooded through my veins was unlike anything I’d ever felt. Wrapped up in childish fascination, I felt brave. Almost euphoric.

The sun cast a harsh glow across the house, and it burned my skin as we approached. I squinted against the sunlight, making sure no one was around. The emptiness seemed almost daunting, and I wondered if it was too late to change my decision. But we marched on anyway, pushing at the wrought-iron gate. 

When you drew close to the grey house, you felt a cold sense of dread. Your heart began to beat against your chest, sensing danger. Your mind raced with possibility— but there was usually nothing in sight. It was this uneasiness that bubbled in my stomach as Issac threw the gate open. The whoosh of wind seemed almost like a whisper. The gate creaked in protest, like it was the first time it had been opened in years. 

I navigated through the weeds, wincing as their tips tickled my skin. From up close, the house looked bigger than I thought. The walls were torn, exposing the mossy brick. It was covered in layers of dust. I almost wondered how it was still standing, why it was still standing, through all the damage and weathering.

It seemed to tower over me, and I felt the strange sense of being watched. I looked up, scaling the house, and then to my sides. There was nothing unusual. My skin crawled; the sense of threat persisted, even though there was no one there except for us. It felt like something might jump out at me through the cracks in the walls, the gaps in the weeds, or the broken windows.

But nothing seemed to happen. The silence was more daunting.

“You alright?” Issac asked, his voice shaky.

“Yes,” I lied, not wanting to accept defeat.

“You sure we’re going to do this?” Issac asked, a flicker of apprehension in his eye.

I nodded, gathering my courage. “Of course.”

Issac mirrored my expression, swallowing thickly. We crossed the barren yard and approached the door. It was ajar, showing only a glimpse of the room within. I stepped up, breathing through the nausea and deafening silence. I jumped when I heard Issac’s footsteps behind. Sensing weight next to me, I threw the door open.
 
The inside was dark, drab and empty. Small sunrays slid through the undeveloped roof. The paint on the walls was peeling, the lightbulb cracked, newspapers strewn messily across the floor. In the centre sat a desk, also flooded with newspapers. I took a deep breath as Issac bent down to examine them. At the far end of the room was a staircase, leading up into darkness. Above the desk were three photographs. They were hung over the desk, right under the lightbulb, like it was supposed to illuminate them. 

Just as I craned my neck to observe the photographs, the uncanny sound of footsteps rang through my ears. It was followed by a feminine giggle, reverberating through the house. 

The blood froze in my veins. I turned, and slammed right into the desk. Pain reverberated through my torso. My shaking hands gripped the edge of the desk as I rasped. Issac grabbed my arm. I turned to him, and it was evident from my expression that my mind did not make the sounds up.

“Did you hear that?” He asked. 

“I did,” I choke. The walls seemed to close in on me; but the source of the noise was still invisible. I felt like a danger was looming just out of sight.

“There’s someone in here,” Issac whispered, stepping back. He gazed at the stairs. 

“We should get out,” I murmured. 

“We should,” He agreed. “This was a bad idea.”

Issac stepped back, and turned to exit the house. He began to scamper towards the door. Gripping my torso, I followed, yearning to shake this dreadful feeling. 

The sound grew in intensity. Soon, it sounded like someone was banging against the walls. It reverberated through my ears, causing a stabbing pain in my head. I felt cornered, trapped. Adrenaline surged through my veins as my feet carried me further. 

I froze when the feminine voice returned. It reverberated through my mind this time, cold and echoing. I tired to move my feet, but they seemed to be rooted to the ground. A strange feeling crawled up my limbs, like they were moving of their own accord. 

 “Where are you?”

My heart thudded against my chest. It felt like an ice cube had slid down my back. The footsteps were behind me now, growing closer. I balled my fists, gathering the courage to turn back— but my limbs seemed to be rooted in one place. I see Issac’s silhouette pause. He must have sensed my absence. 

Each footstep sent ripples of panic through my heart. Beads of sweat ran down my forehead. My ears rung, my vision growing blurry, until I finally fought the wave of terror.

I turned back. 

She was so small. Pale, scrawny, wearing a matted pink dress. The girl had twin braids and a frail smile. Unsteadily, she descended the mossy staircase. I felt the dread slowly dissipate. It was just a child, after all. I stayed firmly rooted in place as she approached me. Issac returned to my side, curious.

“Hello, there,” I said, lowering my voice.
The girl didn’t reply, and walked closer. 

Her footsteps sounded oddly heavy for someone her size. 

And as I saw her face clearly, my eyes widened. Her skin looked like plastic, thin and crumpled at places. She was so pale it nauseated me. Her eyes…they were blank. She was clearly blind. There was something in the haze of those orbs that made me lose my mind. A strange force swirled there, one that unnerved me. 

 There was a tremor in her step, a haziness to her movements that led me to believe that she was disturbed. It caused my heart to bleed, but I still couldn’t figure out the reason. What could have happened to this small child?

She walked closer, face dropping in fear. She timidly craned her neck towards us. 

“What are you doing here?” Issac asked, bending forward.

At that, the girl’s smile faded instantly, and I felt a knot of discomfort at my chest. 

“I- I live here.” She replied, folding her bony arms. I winced at the crack that sounded after– human bones do not crack this easily. 

I threw a quick glance at the ruins around me, my mind reeling. My fists clenched firmly. 

“Who else lives here?” I question, not being able to hold back the curiosity.

“My parents.” She answered, pointing towards the pictures above the desk.

I looked at them carefully. Illuminated by sunlight were the images of three people, first, an older, balding man, a woman who seems to be his wife, and a third lady. “These are your parents?” I asked the girl, knitting my brows together.

She nodded, smiling softly. 

“Then who is the third woman?” Issac questioned.

The girl remained silent, dropping her arms to her sides. Another crack reverberated through the room. I was in awe of the situation; I did not know that the grey house had residents. Perhaps no one did. But how would a family survive in these old ruins of a home? I opened my mouth, intending to ask the girl her name, but I was cut off.

“Who are you?” She asked, pointing at Issac. Her voice was shaky; she sounded frightened. Issac and I shared a look of confusion. 

Issac tried to pacify her. “Hey, we’re not here to hurt you-”

“Why don’t you answer me?” The girl whispered. It was an empty question. Something about the way she spoke seriously unsettled me. Something that was a step away from danger. 

Issac sighs. “Relax, I’m just-”

“Why don’t you answer me?” She cried. The sound sent pinpricks down my skin. My stomach churned. 

I looked at Issac again, feeling the same sense of impending danger. Something about her wasn’t right; the more I stood here, the more frightened I became. I was gripped by the desire to leave right then. 

“I’ll answer you,” I said, just to calm her. “I’m Cody, and this here is my friend, Issac. We both just lost our way, and entered this house by accident. What’s your name?”

“Valerie.” She answers. 

“Well, Valerie, we should get going now. It- it was nice meeting you,” I concede. 

The girl did not move. Her lifeless eyes bored into mine, and I looked away, unable to meet them. She stepped forward, and a vine of fear wraps around my heart. I nudged Issac, and begin to slowly step outside. 

The strange force resting in the blankness of her eyes added a heaviness to my step. My heartbeat quickened, and my mind raced. 

The young, blind girl stood in her spot as we quietly retreated from the grey house, still gazing expectantly. She looked monstrous. I looked away, unable to meet her eyes.Gooseflesh rose across my skin. The girl looked disoriented, and tried to reach for us. We attempted to make as little noise as possible as we left. 

I kept my movements slow as I turned towards the door, Issac in tow. The strange girl was a sharp presence behind me. The haunting emptiness of the house was starting to make me sick. I had not breathed properly since I entered. Something about this place had numbed my senses, and I yearned to be out of there. 

Right as I stepped past the door, I took a final glance back at Valerie. She still looked expectant, like she was mid-conversation. The room was obscured by darkness, overtaken by mystery once again. She stood alone amidst the shadows, looking monstrous. It was the most haunting sight I had ever seen. It would colour my dreams for weeks after.

Issac was the first to the door. Before I could leave, however, a small whisper tingled in my ears:

“Are you going to leave me here?’

She sounded so childlike I paused for a second. But the hammering of my heart reminded me that the cuteness was an illusion, that the strange entity was looking to get closer. I swallowed, ignoring the plea. 

I let the door close in front of the blind girl, and when it thumped against the doorframe, I let out a deep, shuddering breath. 

We got out of there at lightning speed. Needless to say, we faced several punishments for infiltrating the notorious grey house. We hardly spoke about the trip again- the words were always silenced by fear. We never told anyone either. I have convinced myself somehow that the events that occured at the house were never real at all– that it was all just a horrible dream. 

Update 1: The events of the past few days have been a whirlwind. I really feel like I need to vent it out. 

 Issac was murdered.

He was coming home from a friend's house late at night. He lives in a narrow lane on the outskirts– and was found dead the next morning at the neck of the lane. Stabbed, they say. The killer is still not identified. The image of his corpse still remains embedded in my mind. I've never seen him so pale. 

His eyes were open, his head thrown back, the gashes across his abdomen bleeding openly. Blood coagulated next to his body, staining the grey road a bright red. The marks looked almost like an animal attack. But each one of them dug deep and tore through his internal organs. It sends chills of horror down my spine. 

I have not quite accepted it all. The events still mar my mind like a haze. I kept running the possibilities over and over in my mind, unwilling to plunge into the cold waters of reality. 

The truth is, I've never felt at ease since I spoke to the girl. That sense of impending doom never actually left me. I realise I've been looking over my shoulder, checking the empty spaces for danger more times than necessary. Could Issac’s death have something to do with this? This thought had my mind in a chokehold. 

Update 2: I couldn't really focus after Issac’s death. All I could think about was the grey house and its curse. So I did what I thought was best, and barged into the neighbourhood committee head’s home.

I interrogated the aggravated man about the grey house. There had to be something concrete that linked those events, and I felt the overpowering thirst for answers. The man was hesitant at first, but at my insistence, he provided an account of what went down at that place. I took copious notes, and I am reviewing them now. 

Three decades ago, the grey house was owned by a family of three. It was an older couple who had a blind daughter.  

The committee head showed me their pictures on his phone. They were the exact same pictures we saw in the grey house a week ago. One was of the balding man. He swiped left, and it showed the picture of his wife. He swiped once again, to the third photograph, which the young girl refused to identify. 

He said it was of Valerie, their dead daughter. 

She was just a kid when we saw her. 

This used to be a desolate neighbourhood, with very little safety. Though the couple that owned the grey house were very careful about their daughter, not letting her wander off even for a few minutes. 

But one day, when she was playing outside, she was kidnapped by a group of men. She was brutally raped. The whole time, the blind girl was confused about the perpetrators. She desperately kept asking them, but they would not respond. In her recollection, she kept asking them, why won’t you answer me? But they refused to. It was ghastly.

The criminals were never caught, but in the years that followed, Valerie kept deteriorating. The couple later moved out of the house, and it was rented out to one of the committee workers. The worker left soon after, complaining of disturbing events inside the home. Due to neglect, the house has its characteristic murkiness.

Research on these strange events suggests a pattern. Residents had spotted a young, blind child that asked them a seemingly innocent question. She would appear out of nowhere and would be confused about her whereabouts. But  the that residents failed to answer her, or answered improperly, they were the victim of violence, and in rare cases, death. 

The new information crossed my mind like a tidal wave. Suddenly, the events began to snap into place. I understood why the grey house felt so miserable. I was almost certain that the girl we saw was a resemblance, a shadow of the girl whose home it was. Who died within the confines of this neighbourhood. 

Why won't you answer me? 

Valerie’s cry played in my mind like a cruel record. It felt like I was in the grey house all over again, the crawling darkness surrounding me, the musty smell of dirt, the unforgiving fear- 

Did those events lead to his death? 

It seemed too far-fetched at first, but the more I thought about it, the deeper the possibility dug into my mind. The girl asked Issac who he was. He ignored her question, posing one of his own. A week later, he is found dead with unnatural wounds. It seems improbable, but….there is no denying the stark uneasiness that grips my heart when I think of that girl. She was certainly not natural. 

I'm hit with a wave of guilt; does that mean I was the reason behind his death? Did our trip to the grey house end up costing his life? If I hadn't asked him to join me…perhaps Issac would still be alive. Is that girl’s final plea a manifestation of some sort? 

 If she truly took the life of whoever doesn't answer her….No. I broke out in a sweat. The image of Issac lying dead on the road makes me nauseous. I felt sick to my stomach. 

A ripple of relief darted through me when I realised I was the one that answered her question. I was safe from the shadow…I had nothing to be afraid of. 

Unless…..

“Are you going to leave me here?”

The ghost of the unanswered question haunts my mind. I did not answer her question. I know what is to come. I can't sleep. I am in constant fear, just waiting for the entity to consume me.
