There are many things unknown in this world. Things we cannot see or understand, no matter how hard we try. Somethings are eyes are not meant to see; somethings are minds are not meant to understand. The argument can be made that we can study and learn, but were we meant to know everything. It is in our nature to want answers, but then what? Answers tend to lead to more questions. What does one do with knowledge of something unknown. Do we share it or keep it to ourselves?

You could call me an average sort of person. I’m by no means a model, but confident enough to be a step or two outside of ugly. Someone who didn’t quite grow out of their adolescent awkwardness, but I happily embrace it. Not the most social butterfly, but also not a shut in or hermit, watching the world pass by behind a pane of glass. 

I grew up in a small town, taking a job in an office. I kept to myself, but slowly inched my way up a ladder. When I was offered a management position in a larger town some miles away, I said screw it and took it. Similar mind numbing work behind a keyboard and screen, but I’d have my own office and an entire floor would be underneath my watchful gaze. 

It was an easy decision. My parents had both passed away and I had no other family or siblings, no loved ones, no one to keep me tethered there. It really came down to breaking out of my comfortable shell. Something told me to go, and I swung and cracked though. Packed up my scant belongings, my simple life, and was soon in a larger town, but not quite the bustling city most of my generation prefer. I set up shop and gingerly settled into my new role.

I wouldn’t call myself a hard ass boss my any means. My people preformed exceptionally well, and I allowed them to do so. I wasn’t one to crack the whip, but if I had to talk to someone, I did. I could see the entire floor from within my glass cage and, in turn, they could see me, could see I was always just as busy as they were. Hopefully it was respect. There was always that small part that gnawed at me though. Whenever I would peak over my monitor to see someone hunched near a coworker: were they talking about me? How awful a bass I really was? Higher ups never chewed me out, but I also never received accolades. Was I doing enough?

I never socialized with them outside of the office, but I could tell you all their names, their hobbies. That didn’t matter though, I was content with my humble, simple life. My average life. Maybe that was the problem…

The first time I saw them, I was on my way back to my office, a freshly filled mug in my hand. Heading down the central aisle between desks, I took a sip and glanced towards my office. I stopped dead in my tracks, spitting coffee back into the mug. Someone was sitting at my desk, head down. All I could see was the top of his head peeking over the monitor. I didn’t remember corporate saying anyone was visiting. There was something so familiar about that dark brown hair, like I had met this person before. 

A voice broke my gaze from the glass walls. Giselle Swenson looked up at me, a Flickr of concern in her green eyes. She enjoyed spending her weekends hiking around the nearby trails.

“You okay, boss?”

I smiled at her, clenching the handle of the mug so I didn’t spill the steaming coffee. Was she blushing? 

“Oh yes, I’m fine, Giselle,” I lied. “ Just remembering an email I forgot to send.”

“Uh oh,” she feigned fear, raising a hand to lightly brush my arm. “ Don’t wanna peeve off the hierarchy. “

Did her blush deepen? I’d never considered any sort of relationship with any of my employees. I honestly preferred the life of solitude.

“ Definitely,” I retorted with a forced chuckle.

“Better get back at it then, big man.”

Big man? Giselle had already returned to her work. Her black nails clicking across her keyboard. My gaze shot back to my office…my empty office. I sat down, rubbing my eyes, then looked out at the floor. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. No one out of place like they had dashed from my office during my short interaction. 
Maybe it had been a trick of the light. Was I losing it?

 Maybe things were taking a toll on me and I refused to admit it. I tried to shrug it off, but it kept me on edge the rest of the day. Maybe that would have been the end of it, but that was not the last time.

It was some time later, days had passed,, bordering on months. I had forgotten about the incident, going about my life as normal. This time I knew it was not a trick of the light, and it shook me to my core.

I lived in a nice one bedroom apartment not far from the office. I walked to work, it was so close. I used the time to separate myself from the office, and to people watch along the way. Most didn’t notice, some gave me a questioning glare. The occasional smile or furtive glance, even a nod or wave every once in awhile, which I would cordially return. I kept to myself, but wasn’t rude about it. I had no desire to learn more about these people, but they had done nothing to irk me. 

I had left the office long after everyone else, staying late to wrap up some weekly items before the weekend. I grabbed my bag and the dark red sweatshirt, it had been a chilly few days. It was my favorite color, and quite the comfortable Hoodia, one I had had since before my move here. I could easily get something else, perhaps more professional, but it was just so damned comfortable and fit perfectly. 

Leaving the lobby I immediately turned left to begin my usual route home. The street was bustling, but not nearly as busy as it would have been around quitting time. A crisp wind brushed my face as I looked up and down the street, eyes darting to and from. The grey sedan whizzing past, stirring up a warmer, chemically tainted breeze. The elderly gentleman across the street walking a rather pudgy beagle. The rather attractive female bending over down the road to retrieve her dropped phone. The sights, the sounds, the smells, it allowed me to let my mind wander to the upcoming weekend. A couple days I would probably spend at home with a good book.

“On your left!”

The words broke my spell. I scooted right as a man my own age jogged by. A fit specimen and I couldn’t help but let my eyes linger to the shorts that hugged his exquisite buttocks. Perhaps a little too long, but I was entranced until those chiseled cheeks turned a corner.

My gaze returned forward, and that’s when I saw them. 

They stood at the corner up ahead, probably waiting to cross. The same corner I would cross to get to my apartment. Someone in a dark red Hoodia, very similar to my own, but with the hood pulled up over their head. The same bag as mine draped across a shoulder, hanging at their hip. My hand instinctively went to my own, absently stroking the dark canvas. They were shorter than me, but something seemed off about their stance, but I just couldn’t quite place what. 

I was about to shrug it off as the most bizarre consequence. I mean, I took this same route twice a day, daily, for several years and had never seen such a similar get up as mine. Then their head turned and my knees nearly gave out. Time itself seemed to slow down. My own face was underneath that hood. My own face! My own face, yet not quite me face. If he caught a look at me, he didn’t how it. He simply looked both ways then leisurely crossed the road. 

I was transfixed. Locked in place. The world around me failing to properly exist. I could only watch disbelieving, as I walked away from myself. It felt absurd to think like that, but that was all my shocked brain could muster at the time. He moved onto the opposite corner and I lost track of him in a group of people. My eyes darted, struggling to find the dark red Hoodia, but in the waning daylight, it proved unfruitful. He-me?- was gone. The world slowly came back into focus.

Streetlights springing to life. The scent of the nearby steakhouse wafting on the chilly wind. An annoyed grumble parting the fog.

“Sightsee somewhere else, buddy.”

I don’t remember making it home, but somehow I did. Hastily locking the door, shrugging off my bag and letting it fall to the floor. Tearing my hoodie off. I stood there silently, just staring at the sweatshirt in my hands. I threw it across the dark room, letting it disappear into the shadows before shuffling and falling into my couch. I rubbed my eyes, massaging my temples, struggling to calm my racing heart. 

The incident from just over a month ago came rushing back. I had just glimpsed the top of a head then, but I vaguely 4emembered something familiar about it. Had I seen that same person that day too? So many questions rushed into my head.  Did I have a twin brother my parents had never told me about? If so, why? Was work harder on me than I was admitting to myself and I was losing my mind? 

The walls I had built around my simple little life were cracking. I could feel a dull throbbing starting in the back of my head. It was only a matter of time before it crept forward. I needed to get some rest. Maybe that was all I really needed, but I knew it would not come easily. Not without outside help. I would have loved to just knock myself out with a frying pan like some cartoon character, hopefully forget about all this. 8 also knew that that was not practical. I was shaken up and not thinking clearly. I would need some help of the medicinal or alcoholic variety, probably a mixture of both.

I dreamed that night. With the events of the evening and the medicinal cocktail to knock me out, I wasn’t surprised. I remember it so clearly, unlike most of the dreams I have.
I was walking along a worn path, gnarled trees lining each side. Beyond them all I could see was a bluish-gray fog. It was dead silent, almost oppressive. I walked along the path. Nothing seemed to change. The trees were mirrors of each other, stretching along both sides of the path. I just kept walking. Eventually I noticed a blurry form taking shape further up the path. I was unsettled but kept moving. I could faintly make out a rectangular shape. Was it the door out of this place? I started moving faster in hopes it was, but still shooting glances all around, keeping an eye on my ominous surroundings.

No it wasn’t a door. I stopped. A form was moving towards me within the rectangular frame. It moved when I moved, paused when I paused. I raised my hand and waved, the form followed suit. A mirror? I moved forward to stand before the mirror. This close it was far taller than me, but there my reflection stood, staring back at me in bewilderment. 

Yet it wasn’t quite me. Its proportions were off, barely noticeable from afar, but this close it was clear. It was me, but not me. It raised its hands and pressed them against the glass. It stared at me with soulless eyes as a smile grew on its face, stretching into a menacing rictus.

“Wake up,” I whispered to myself, scared to take my gaze off the reflection but desperately not wanting to look upon it.

 Its hands emerged from with the frame. I struggled to turn and run, to move at all, but I was paralyzed, frozen to the spot. The hands grabbed my shoulders, digging in and pulled me towards the mirror, slowly, agonizingly so, pulling me towards it. I could only look on in fear as I was pulled past the frame of the mirror, closer to the me that wasn’t me…

I awoke with a gasp. I was standing in front of my closet doors, which were a pair of full length sliding mirrors. I screamed quietly at my own reflection and fell back into the bed behind me.

 Struggling to calm my racing heart. How did I get up to stand in my sleep? What kind of messed up dream was that? I was clearly losing it. The clock said it was just after three in the morning. I sighed knowing sleep would elude me tonight. 

I spent the rest of the night and the day puttering around the apartment. Did the man I saw the previous evening cause the bizarre nightmare? Did I even get a clear enough look at his face to be certain he looked so damned similar? The sweatshirt and bag were identical. Sure it had been waning light, but I knew what I had seen. The previous vision from my office nearly a month ago reiterating that. Was it possible I had a twin brother no one had ever told me about? My parents and I had been close and surely they wouldn’t have kept that from me.. there were scant family members I could reach out to. Both of my parents had come from very small families. I tried to think of anyone I could ask and if I should even reach out with such a ridiculous question. 

I spent the day trying to occupy myself with menial tasks around my apartment, but nothing could distract me from everything that had occurred within the last 24 hours. Sure it had all started with that quick glimpse in the office, or had it? What if there had been other times this individual had been right beside me on the street, or standing in line behind me at the store, but I had missed it? That thought brought a slight chill down my spine. I thought about going down to the small park behind my building to get some fresh air, but what if I saw him sitting at a bench across the park? The thought of looking out the window, seeing him sitting at a park bench shook me to my core, causing me to stay away from my windows altogether. 

The TV played in the background, but I had no idea what was playing, nor did I care. It was more a distraction from the silence that would cause my mind to wander some dark corridors.
Some way, somehow the day passed. Before I knew it, the sun was setting. A mixture of stressed out exhaustion and copious amounts of medication and alcohol found me drifting into a somewhat fitful sleep. Thankfully there was no nightmares this go, but I was jarred awake just after one in the morning.

The apartment was silent, but a glow was coming from the living room. Had I left the television on? I was sure I had turned it off and I was certain I would not have muted it.

“Hello?” I called, immediately feeling foolish. If I was being robbed, I just alerted them.

There was just silence and the flickering glow from what was clearly the television. I must have left it on. 

I groggy got out of bed and ambled into the living room. I got a few steps in before looking up and stopping dead in my tracks. Silhouetted against the light from the television was a form sitting on the couch. Even in the dim light, I knew who it was.

“How the fuck did you get in here!?” I demanded, all traces of my sleep flushing 8tselfmout of my system.

No response. He just kept watching the screen.

“Hey!” I shouted, stepping closer. “you’ve got the wrong place!”

Nothing, not even a flinch. I took another step closer, resting my hands on the back of the couch. That’s when he glanced over his shoulder and bolted to his feet. Standing there in nothing but a pair of boxer briefs, even in the fluctuating light of the television, there was no doubt this man was my twin. He stood there, arms outstretched, eyes agape. His mouth was moving frantically, but no sound was coming out. He looked like he was shouting, but I heard nothing.

“Who are you?”

He was clearly as taken aback as I was, waving his arms in front of him as if was trying to ward off an attacker. He glanced towards the front door, then to the bedroom, as if trying to discern which was the best bet to get away from me.

“who are you!?” I said again, 4aising my voice. “How did you get in here?”

I stepped toward him and he made his choice, taking off for the bedroom. I grabbed the sides of my head. What the fuck was going on here? Was I dreaming again? Should I follow him? There was no way out from there, but what if had a weapon and was lying in wait in the darkness? Clearly I had startled him. Maybe he was some junkie who had forced his way in, but that didn’t explain the unbelievable resemblance to me. Maybe I should’ve just called the police and let them handle him, but I needed answers.

I moved towards the bedroom, flicking the switch near the door, hoping to catch him off guard. The room was bathed in a soft yellow glow, but was empty. My eyes went to the closed closet, the only place he could have hid. I hadn’t heard the doors slide open or closed, but in the heat of the moment it was possible it was missed. 

“I know you’re in the closet. If you come out, get dressed, and leave I want call the cops.”

Nothing.

I grabbed a book off my nightstand, the closest thing I had to a weapon. The plan was to tear open the door, hitting him with the book, hopefully stunning him enough to get control. I stared at my reflection raising the book and pushed the door open. Shouting, tossing the book while swinging my arm amongst the hanging shirts and pants, trying to cause a commotion to disorient him. He made no response to the flurry, and I soon realized the closer was devoid of anything living. Confused, I thoroughly checked every inch of the closet before giving up.

Where had he gone? I know he hadn’t gone into the bathroom and the bedroom window was closed, the curtains undisturbed. Besides which, he would have to be absolutely insane to jump out of a seventh floor window with no balcony. I rubbed the back of my throbbing head. Maybe I was losing it. Maybe it was time for a vacation from the office. 

I pulled closed the door and there he was, staring back at me, in the mirrored door. A clear view in the lit bedroom. He was me, but not quite me. He was shorter than me, his arms and legs proportionate to his height. 

Stories from my childhood came rushing back to me. Stories told in the dark, stories to scare our friends. Stories of creatures that looked like us, but not quite. Small differences that gave them away. These creatures haunted us, watched us. Some stories told of these creatures trying to lure us away to their world. These creatures would act scared to lull us in. Those that came in contact with these creatures were never heard from again. I dismissed them long ago as children’s scary stories, but there he was, staring at me through the mirror. Their names escaped me, but then I suddenly remembered…

Humans! The word suddenly came to light. This creature was a human, trying to be me.

It stared at me, eyes wide in fear. I smiled at it and its eyes widened even more. It flinched, as if trying to run, but could not move. Its lips were moving, but I could not hear its cries. I reached up to touch the glass, but came upon the familiar feel of my own flesh. I could now hear the faint incoherent mumblings of this creature.

These humans were not so scary as the stories led us to believe. Grinning wider, I moved closer to the mirror.

This human didn’t seem to be scary, quite the opposite. Maybe it was time to branch out, step outside my simple life, maybe learn something about these humans. It would certainly be a story to tell.
