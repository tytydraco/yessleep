I didn’t expect to inherit anything. My grandmother was in her late eighties, sharp as ever but a recluse, living alone in her modest Pennsylvania home. When the call came that she had passed, I braced myself for the usual, funerals, family meetings, and the empty routines that follow a death. But the lawyer’s voice on the other end of the line carried words I didn’t quite believe at first: *she left everything to you.* *You inherit everything.* And so, I found myself sitting at my desk a week later, staring at the paper in my hand, which detailed a small bank account, a list of her possessions, and an old home home that had belonged to her great-grandmother, passed down the generations to her. I didn’t know the house existed before then.

The home was located near a small, fog-covered town in Essex County, Massachusetts. The house was old, Victorian, from the 1800s. They said many English families had made their way to this part of Massachusetts back in the day. Now, the house was mine, an empty thing, left seemingly untouched since the days my great-grandmother had come from England to start life fresh.

I couldn’t help but think of it as an opportunity: an old, historic home, full of history, full of stories, full of *value*. I packed my things, closed the door to my small Philadelphia apartment, and made my way to the old house with dreams of making it profitable, restoring its charm, selling it at a premium, and starting over with a huge stack of cash.

The house came into view as I pulled down a narrow road at the end of a steep hill. It was huge, and unmistakably old, with two stories of pale wood, steep gabled roofs, and high windows.

I had looked for the best-reviewed realtor in the area ahead of time and had him meet me there. I parked in the gravel driveway and climbed out of my car. The realtor was waiting on the porch, his hand already outstretched waiting to greet me. He had the look of a professional, sharp and well put-together.

“Hello, welcome” he said as I approached. His voice was smooth and steady, and he looked at me with an easy smile. “I’m Samuel Drake. It’s good to meet you. I’ll be helping you through the sale of this property, making it as pain-free as possible for you.”

I shook his hand and looked at the house again. It looked… lived-in, almost, despite being vacant for so long. “Yes. Thank you for meeting me here,” I said, trying to keep my tone neutral.

Drake glanced back toward the house as though he’d already been thinking about this. “This house has a lot of value. Properties like this one, historic homes in this part of Massachusetts, they’re rare. With a bit of cleaning and repair, this could easily sell for close to a million. There’s interest here, especially with the old Victorian charm and the history behind it. It’s a prime candidate for restoration.”

I stared back at him, caught off-guard. Almost a million dollars. The number hung in the air for a moment. I wasn’t sure how I’d expected this trip to go, but I hadn’t expected to hear that.

“Really? That much?” I managed to say, surprised at how calm I sounded.

Drake nodded, stepping toward the house. “Oh, yes. There’s demand for homes like this. And with the right work, it could be an easy sale. Nothing that can’t be managed with a little attention to detail.”

Before I could respond, another figure came from the side of the house, tall, broad-shouldered, his hair a bright white that contrasted against his flannel shirt. He looked at me as though he already knew who I was.

 “Hi there, I’m Jonathan Hale,” he said, offering his hand in greeting. His voice was deep, steady, and his handshake was firm.

“Hi Jonathan… sorry but… who are you?” I asked.

“I’m the caretaker, I’ve been caring for the place for years, 23 to be exact, maintaining the property. Your grandmother employed me for to look after this place and make sure it didn’t fall into disrepair. It’s good to meet you.”

I shook his hand, feeling the strength in his grip. He looked at the house briefly, as though sizing it up in the same way I was. “You’ve done a great job keeping this place up,” I said, looking around at the house and its well-maintained appearance.

Jonathan smiled faintly. “Ah, thank you, but I’m not a young man anymore, so some things have been harder to keep up with. Some things just need attention. But nothing that will be a big problem,” he said, and his voice was calm, practical.

Samuel clapped his hands together, breaking the brief silence. “Well, let’s not waste time. I’ll show you inside and we’ll get you started on what you need to know about the house. I can give you the grand tour, and go over all the details about market prep.”

I glanced back at the house again as Samuel led the way toward the door. The house wasn’t ominous or cold, it was elegant, if a bit dusty, and it had the air of an old property with stories and history but nothing that sent a shiver down my spine. I wasn’t thinking about ghosts, shadows, or hidden secrets. I wasn’t even thinking about the history of my family that had led me here.

I was thinking about that number again, close to a million. It sounded good. It sounded like freedom.

“Yeah, lead the way” I said, following Samuel into the house.

Jonathan gave a polite wave as he turned back toward his truck.

“Come on inside,” Samuel said as he turned toward the house again, motioning to the heavy wooden door. His voice broke the quiet.

I followed him up the steps and through the wide front door, its brass doorknob worn smooth. Stepping into the entryway, I could feel the cold from the outdoors ease slightly, replaced by the faint creak of the wooden floors beneath my shoes.

The first thing I noticed about the house was its age. But not in a way that felt oppressive or eerie, it felt lived-in, as though it was frozen in time. The walls were adorned with pale floral wallpaper that looked faded but elegant, the patterns intricate swirls of muted green and gold that must have been beautiful in their prime. The grand staircase curved up to the second floor, the dark mahogany polished but showing signs of age. Its wood felt solid under my hand as I touched the banister.

“This entryway is one of the most charming parts of the house,” Samuel said, looking at me as I took in my surroundings. His hands were clasped loosely in front of him, his voice even and friendly as he gestured around. “When this house was built, they really took their time with craftsmanship. Look at this woodwork, staircase, bannisters, the original molding around the doors. They don’t make them like this anymore.”

I nodded and took a few steps further into the space, my eyes tracing the patterns on the floor; oak hardwood. “I can see that,” I said.

The living room was directly to the right of the entryway, through a wide archway. Samuel led me inside, and I could feel the size of the space. It was large, with a high ceiling, ornate plasterwork on the edges, and a massive fireplace that took up almost the entire far wall. The mantle was carved wood, with ivy-like scrolls curling into the corners. The hearth was empty now, cold and gray, but I could imagine it roaring with a fire on a winter’s night.

“This is the original fireplace, here since day one. You’ll need to make sure it’s cleaned up, but it has good bones. Nothing that needs replacing unless you want to upgrade things.”

I took in the space. The wide bay windows let in just enough natural light to highlight the faint dust floating in the air. I could almost hear old voices from the past: laughter, footsteps, the faint clink of teacups.

Samuel seemed to catch me staring. “It’s got a lot of potential. The kind of charm buyers look for.”

He started moving toward the hallway leading deeper into the house, and I followed. As we walked through the corridor, the sound of our shoes on the floorboards felt almost intrusive, breaking the stillness of the air. The hallway was narrow, lined with doors on either side. Most of the rooms had wooden frames around their entryways, with faded floral patterns matching the wallpaper in the foyer.

“This house has six bedrooms,” Samuel said, pausing as he gestured to a door on the right. “And a formal dining room, a parlor, and a butler's pantry off the kitchen. The roof was redone about 30 years ago, so it’s solid and in good condition. Most of the upkeep has been maintenance here and there, like addressing cracks in the plaster, ensuring the old piping works well.”

We stepped into one of the rooms, which was bright even with the overcast sky outside. The walls were pale blue with white trim, and there was a single large window letting in light. The bed frame was gone, but the size of the space was impressive; high ceilings, wooden floors, and a small wardrobe sitting against one wall.

“It doesn’t look like much now, but this will be ideal for staging or showing,” Samuel added, looking around the space. “These rooms will shine with just a fresh coat of paint and a little attention. You can decide on how much you want to invest in repairs. Honestly, I think you’ll find that the charm of the house and its history will speak for themselves to buyers with minimal upgrades.”

I glanced back at him, taking the space in again. “What about the yard? The bushes out front and the overgrowth. It looks like it’s been a while since anyone worked on the landscaping.”

Samuel nodded in agreement. “Yes, we should focus on the outside, it won’t be anything you can’t handle with a little time. The older gentleman who helped with the property mostly focused on maintenance inside, so the garden and surrounding foliage have gotten a bit wild over the years. If you want, I can give you a few contacts for local landscapers. It might save time.”

I looked through the window at the backyard. The yard stretched back into a forest of trees, old pines and maples. It looked like an untouched wilderness, which would only add to the appeal for the right buyer but still felt like it would need attention.

“It’s fine, I’ll take care of it myself,” I said, knowing I couldn’t afford landscapers. It was clear this was going to be a lot of work, but nothing that seemed insurmountable. Not yet anyway. “Anything else I should know before diving into this?”

Samuel offered a thin smile and gestured toward the front windows as he leaned his hands on the wall. “Nothing major. The house is solid overall, but the age will always bring its quirks, old pipes, old wiring. But you’ll see all of that as you get started. The real key is cleaning up the place without losing the original character. That’s what buyers are looking for.”

I took a deep breath, looking back at the large living room and its worn yet graceful design.

“All right,” I said, taking another look at the hallway. “Well, let me get started.”

Samuel gave another easy, confident smile and led the way as he showed me the rest of the home.

After Samuel wrapped up the tour, his parting words were brief and professional. “If you need anything, just give me a call. I look forward to working with you.” He gave me a firm handshake by the door and departed, leaving me alone with the house.

I stood in the quiet entryway for a moment, staring at the door as it clicked shut behind him. The house felt much larger and quieter now that I was alone. I shook it off, grabbed my duffel bag from the couch, and made my way into the living room. I set up a fire in the large stone fireplace with a few logs I’d found in the yard.

I ordered some takeout from a local Chinese place and sat cross-legged on the living room floor with my carton of sesame chicken. After dinner, I laid out my sleeping bag near the fire. I wasn’t planning to waste money on hotels or anything while I was here, so it made sense to just sleep in the living room for now. It was warm, cozy enough.

The first night passed without incident. I slept deeply by the fire, the warmth keeping the cold air outside at bay. My mind was thinking about money, and the tasks I needed to complete as I drifted off, and I didn’t stir until the first light of morning shined through the windows.

I woke to the sound of birds in the trees and a thin streak of sunlight cutting through the curtains. I could feel the soreness in my throat from a night sleeping in dusty air next to a fire, but I forced myself up and stretched. Today would be the first real day of getting to know the property, of starting the hopefully short road to cleaning and preparing it for sale.

I grabbed my coat, a pair of gloves, and my work boots from the front hall, then made my way out the front door into the chill of the morning.

The first few hours of yard work felt productive, if not exhausting. Around noon, I decided I needed a break. My hands were raw, my arms sore, and the cold wind felt like it went right through my coat. I leaned my rake against an old oak tree in the front yard and stood for a moment, staring at the house.

I wiped my nose with my sleeve and decided that it would be good to poke around a little more inside. I had some time to kill, and the house had plenty more to see.

I wandered through the house slowly, this time on my own without Samuel as a guide. I let my curiosity lead me. The rooms felt different when you explored them without purpose. It was fun exploring the place, and I was hoping maybe I’d find a secret room or something interesting.

I started opening doors one by one, rooms filled with antiques, covered furniture, and other knick-knacks. Upstairs, toward the back of the house, I found another room, it wasn’t locked, but there was a resistance when I turned the handle, as though the door had been forgotten or avoided for a long time.

I hesitated for just a moment, then pushed it open.

The room was dim, the light barely reaching it through a small window. There were trunks, old ones, wooden and worn, and a writing desk by the window. I could see scraps of paper scattered on the desk, some of them half-buried beneath dust and age. The smell hit me first, a faint mustiness.

I walked over to the desk and began to examine the papers, brushing the dust off the top. What I found made my breath catch.

It was a journal. The leather cover was aged and worn, and the pages were filled with elegant handwriting in a style that was old, deliberate, and beautiful. It was difficult at first to read. It used words and phrasing I wasn’t used to, but as I read, I felt my excitement grow.

The journal clearly belonged to my great-great-grandmother. Excited, I took the journal back downstairs with me, setting it on my sleeping bag with plans to read it in the evening once I was done with my yard work.

I finished up my work outside, feeling sore but accomplished. I ordered dinner from a local pizza place, eager to sit by the fire, warm and quiet, and read the journal I had found earlier.

After setting up my food and lighting a fresh fire, I sat on my sleeping bag and picked up the journal. I flipped it open to the first page and began to read.

The first passages felt simple enough, descriptions of daily life, observations of neighbors, the excitement and trepidation of starting fresh. She wrote about life in England, the decision to leave it all behind, and the first time she laid eyes on the house. The dialect was a little tough to follow at first, but I got the hang of it. It felt so personal that it was almost overwhelming to read.

Her observations about her first few days here were fascinating, how everything felt strange, how every sound in the night felt new and alien. She talked about the neighbors, the local gossip, and the way people in this small New England town would gather at local events. She detailed a boy she fancied, an innocent crush that seemed to consume her thoughts. The pages brought alive a world that felt completely lost to time, a delicate web of thoughts, fears, and joys from someone long gone.

It was unexplainable to feel connected to her this way. It was like meeting a ghost, one who felt alive, real, and painfully human. The hours slipped by as I read, each passage a window into a life that felt so personal and so distant. I found myself wishing, in that moment, that my grandmother could have been here to read this.

I got to the next page, this one different than the previous. I read:

 *---------------------------------------*

*This morn I awoke with a heaviness in my breast, a most unshakable dread that clings to me still. The air within this ancient house is colder than the season should permit, as though the very stones themselves exhale a breath from the depths of time. A feeling hangs here, sinister and unseen, lurking in the shadows of darkened corners and shifting when my gaze wavers.*

*At night, the sounds are most disquieting. Faint steps, always faint, yet deliberate, tread unseen paths through the dim and drafty corridors. I have listened with great patience, convinced they are no natural sound of earthly origin. At first, I entertained the notion that it was but the old timbers settling beneath the weight of age, but no. These are footsteps with purpose, footsteps that linger, that follow, that watch. They are not wholly of this house.*

*Last night, as I lay in my bed, I thought I spied a shadow in the gloom, a frail, sinister sliver of motion just beyond the edge of the door. My heart leapt within my chest, and I grasped at my prayer book as though it might offer me protection from the unseen. Yet it is no prayer that shall save me should this presence indeed prove real. The sensation of being watched is akin to a cold, unseen hand at the nape of my neck, unyielding and vile.*

*This morning, I spoke of these matters to Henry, careful with my words lest I appear as one given to flights of fancy. His gaze, pale and grey as the mist, met mine, yet he said not a word. Perhaps he thinks I am but given to idle imaginings.*

*But I am not accustomed to such things. I feel them, night and day. This house holds secrets, ancient and restless things. I fear they are no mere figments of my mind. I fear they watch me.*

  *---------------------------------------*

I sat for a moment, considering the words I read. I decided to stop there, not wanting to get any further. That night, I went to bed a little more restlessly, Noticing the sounds of the old home more. Every creak of the old wood sounding just a bit louder.

I woke the next morning after a restless night of tossing and turning, my body aching and my throat sore again. I’d hardly slept at all. My muslces hurt from the previous day’s work, and the thought of getting back out into the yard to clear more brush didn’t appeal to me in the slightest.

I managed to force myself outside for a couple of hours, shoveling dirt, pulling stray branches, and trying to make some progress. But by mid-morning, my body had other plans. My hands trembled, my back ached, and I knew I’d hit my limit. I packed it in and went inside, deciding that today wasn’t going to be a day for hard labor.

I figured a change of scenery might clear my head. I drove into town to a cozy little coffee shop. There was always something about the warm smell of coffee and the sound of people chatting that made me feel better. I brought the journal with me, thinking I might spend some time reading while I was there. I tucked it under my arm as I parked my car and headed inside, glad for the idea of a warm drink and a break from the house for a while.

With a coffee in-hand, I grabbed a chair by the window and decided to dive back into the journal. The next entry was as follows:

  *---------------------------------------*

*This day finds me in a state of profound unease, a weakness that clings to me as though my very soul has been sapped. I wake each morn with the sun, yet there is no vigor in my limbs, no strength in my bones. It is as though some unseen weight bears upon me, pressing down upon me through every hour.*

*The nights are worse. Last eve, as I lay in my bed with the wind howling without, I could hear them again, footsteps. They came from above, deliberate, heavy, yet there is no one there. My hand clutched at my prayer book as though it might shield me from these sounds, but it is of no use. The sound is constant, scraping, shuffling. Sometimes, they cease, as though waiting, and I lie in the dark, listening, with my heart in my throat.*

*The walls, too, seem to be alive with a kind of whispering. A scratching, faint and cruel, as if something moved within them, unseen and hungry. I have tried to convince myself that it is the old house settling, that the sound of age and wood might be mistaken for something sinister. Yet, I know better. I know he is there. I hear him.*

*Last night, when I dared leave my bed to see to the door, my breath caught in my chest. Through the crack of the door, which I had left ajar, I swore I saw it. An eye. A great, round, glimmering eye, pale as bone and fixed upon me with an unyielding stare. I froze as though the very sight had turned me to stone, and I dared not move, nor breathe, nor pray. The feeling is one I cannot describe, for it is as though the darkness knows my heart, as though it sees into me.*

*I fear I am going mad. I feel it in the daytime as well, this presence, a kind of languid despair that creeps into my bones. I am powerless here. I feel the energy of my life draining, as though this house has set its teeth into me and refuses to let go.*

*I pray this is but my own fancy, my mind given over to nerves and strain. But the sounds persist, and the eye lingers. I fear the day I will see it again. I fear the day, I shall not merely see it through the crack but see it here, beside me.*

  *---------------------------------------*

*What the hell was going on with her?* I wondered to myself. Was she going crazy? Was the isolation getting to her? I felt bad for her in that moment. Away from the house and in a new setting, I was certain she was experiencing some sort of mental health crisis, not understood properly during that time. I read on.

  *---------------------------------------*

*This entry comes with trembling hand and a heart that beats as though it would burst from my chest. I scarcely know how to put these things to paper, for words seem a poor defense against the horrors that now plague me. The eye, that dreadful, unyielding eye, hath returned. I see it again, always through cracks, through the narrowest fissures in doors, through the space at their edges. It watches me, cold and unblinking, as though it hath the power to see into the very depths of my soul. It is no longer confined to my bedchamber alone. Nay, I see it now in every door, those leading to the parlour, to the hallway, to the old kitchen. A terrible, pale orb that waits, and watches, and knows me.*

*Last night, I awoke with a jolt, my breath ragged, to see it once more. This time, not merely a hint or shadow, but a full sight, clear in its terrible form. A tall, frail figure stood beside me in the bed, lit only by the cold, pale glow of the moonlight streaming through the window. I could not move, could scarcely breathe, for my terror was as sharp as a knife. I dared not look for long, lest the sight take hold of my reason.*

*I reached for the spill, hands trembling, and lit the candles by my bed. The light grew warm and golden, dancing across the walls and ceiling, and yet when the flame touched the shadows, the figure was gone. As though it had never been. My heart ached with doubt, but the fear remained, cold and cruel. I could not shake the certainty that it would return, that it had been there, and that it would come again.*

*I feel as though the time is near, that some sinister design is being carried out upon me, some foul and terrible thing that I cannot prevent nor escape. It watches, and I feel its unseen plans growing, twisting, tightening like the grip of a noose.*

*I dread what will come next. Will I awaken again to find it beside me? Or will it come through the door, its intentions manifest and unyielding? My mind grows more frantic with each passing hour. I do not know how much longer I can endure this torment, this feeling that something waits, always waits, to bring about its cruel design.*

  *---------------------------------------*

I set the journal down for a moment, running my hand over my face. A chill had run up my spine, and I couldn’t shake the feeling. My chest felt tight, and I wondered if I should stop reading. What if this was a mistake? I didn’t want to let old fears and old stories get to me.

Maybe I should put it aside, I thought. Maybe reading this was only going to make me more anxious, make me think things I shouldn’t. The old house, the old journal, the strange things written within, it  was creepy, but it could all just be the ramblings of a lonely 19^(th) century woman. People were more superstitious back then, after all. And yet, I felt bad for her. There was so much fear in her words, so much desperation.

But no. It wasn’t real, was it? I tried to convince myself of that. These things always feel bigger when you’re alone, when you’re worn out or stuck in a dark house. It was probably nothing, a creak from wood or a draft coming in through the cracks in the walls. That was all. I wasn’t going to let this make me afraid to go back to the house.

I picked the journal back up, trying to shake off the tension. I wasn’t going to let it get to me. I’d finish reading this, and it would all make sense. Maybe she worked through it. Maybe she found out it wasn’t anything at all in the end. These old stories often have a way of building themselves up, don’t they? Fear out of nothing. That’s what I’d tell myself. It was fine. I’d just keep reading.

  *---------------------------------------*

*This hand trembles as I write, and my breath comes quick at the very act of putting this to paper. I can scarce hold my quill pen, my fingers so weak and cold, for I know this shall be my last. My soul feels as though it hangs by but a single thread, stretched taut with every passing moment.*

*I awoke again in the dead of night, as though from some restless dream. My heart leapt in my chest at the sight of it, a figure standing at the foot of my bed, as real as the shadows themselves. It watched me, cold and pale, a horrible, unyielding stare. I could not move, nor cry out. I could scarcely breathe. The eyes, those dreadful, pale eyes, followed me, and they were everywhere.*

*Not merely in my bedchamber, nay. It lingered in every darkened corner, through every crack and shadow, in the spaces between doors and walls. It watches me as I went about my duties in the house. It watches me as I descended the stairs or ventured into the kitchen. No matter the place, the gaze is there, unyielding, unblinking, and filled with a terrible knowing.*

*I could not bear it any longer. I made up my mind to confront it, to stare back, to ask it what it wanted of me. Perhaps I could command it away, or find some understanding, some explanation to silence this torment. I rose from my bed, trembling, and took a step toward the door. My hand grasped the handle, my heart pounding with a kind of fury I cannot explain. I pushed the door open, my breath hitching.*

*And there, from the dark, came a hand. It was black as pitch, thin and claw-like, and it reached from behind the door with a slow, creeping motion, like the very hand of death. I could see it through the faint glow of moonlight, gnarled and terrible, grasping toward me. My breath came out in a strangled cry, and I turned and fled.*

*I ran, felt as though I was pursued by all the devils of hell down the narrow hallway, my legs weak beneath me. My voice was lost, and my body moved of its own volition as I sought the only refuge I could find. I hurled open the door and locked it behind me, my hands shaking as I drew the bolt.*

*I sit here now at this very desk as I record what I fear are my final thoughts. The sound persists. The doorknob is moving, rattling against the lock, and I can hear the groan of it as though it is alive. It seeks entry. Perhaps it shall come for me at last. Perhaps my words will be the last act of defiance, the last testament to my fear, my frailty, my hope.*

*But if this is to be my end, then so be it. I fear it no lon*

  *---------------------------------------*

The entry stopped there. I flipped through to the next page to find it empty, as well as the rest of the journal. That was her final entry.

With the sun setting, I knew it was time to head back to the house. I couldn’t stay in the coffee shop forever, and until I got my big payday, I couldn’t afford a hotel. The thought of returning to the house filled me with unease, but I reminded myself why I was here: the faster I got the place fixed up, the faster I could sell it and walk away with more money than I had ever seen. That was the goal, and it was worth enduring a little discomfort, or so I told myself.

By the time I pulled into the driveway, it was dark outside. I parked and forced myself inside, telling myself it was just another night. The journal and its entries were still fresh in my mind, but I chalked it all up to the ramblings of an isolated, frightened woman. This wasn’t reality. This was just an old house.

I settled in for the evening, flicking on a lamp to chase away the dark corners. As I tried to focus on a book, something caught my eye. A faint movement, a pale circle, unmoving, peering at me from the narrow crack of a door across the hall. My heart leapt, and for a long moment, I couldn’t move. It was an eye. It was the eye. Watching me, I was sure of it.

But when I blinked and forced myself to look again, it was gone. Nothing but the shadow of the door and my overactive imagination. "This damn house is getting to me," I muttered, shaking my head. I closed the book and turned in for the night, determined to put it all behind me.

Sleep didn’t come easily. Every creak of the house seemed amplified. At times, I thought I heard movement in the walls, soft, deliberate, like something dragging itself along inside them. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up, but I told myself it was just the age of the house. Still, the feeling of being watched persisted, keeping me glancing over my shoulder.

At some point, exhaustion overtook me, and I drifted into a fitful sleep. Sometime during the night, I woke suddenly. I felt frozen, a deep, primal fear washing over me. I knew something was wrong, and I wasn’t alone. I didn’t want to look, but I forced myself to, becoming aware of something standing in the doorway.

It was tall, dark, its frame thin. Its outline was indistinct, but the eyes… the eyes glowed faintly in the darkness, pale and unblinking, looking directly at me. My breath caught in my throat as terror ran through me. I couldn’t move, couldn’t think. I was frozen in pure fear.

And then it shifted, ever so slightly, as though it were about to step forward. That was enough to snap me out of my frozen state. I bolted upright with some kind of instinctual, pathetic whimper, but the figure was gone. The doorway stood empty, and the room was quiet.

I didn’t wait. Grabbing my keys, I fled the house, stumbling onto the front lawn gasping for air. My heart pounded in my ears, and tears streaked down my face as I glanced back at the house. And that’s when I saw it again.

Peaking from around the edge of the front door, just visible in the dim light, was a shadow, and those eyes. Pale. Watching me.

I didn’t stick around to see what it would do next. I got in my car and drove away, the house shrinking in my rearview mirror, but the image of those eyes is forever burned into my mind.

I know now what my great-great grandmother went through was real, I saw it myself. I don’t know what happened to her, but I know she must have met a terrible fate. I never went back to the house, and I never will. I want nothing to do with it. I called Samuel Drake and told him I wanted to sell the house as is. I don’t care what I get for it at this point, I just want it out of my possession as quickly as possible.
