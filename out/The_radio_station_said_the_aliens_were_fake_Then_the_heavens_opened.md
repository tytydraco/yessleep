I remember that April Fools’ Day started off so ordinary. Evening sunlight slanted through my living room window, and I was sprawled on the couch with the radio playing softly. When the music suddenly cut out mid-song, replaced by a harsh emergency alert tone, I barely batted an eye. Here we go, I thought. Another April Fools’ gag.

A crisp announcer’s voice broke through: 

***“This is not a test. Unidentified objects have been sighted in the skies over major cities…”*** 

I smirked, recognizing the homage to the infamous War of the Worlds broadcast. The station was really committing to the bit—there was even a field reporter describing bright lights descending over a local park, his voice quivering just enough to sound afraid. Cheesy, but I had to admit it was entertaining.

At first I grinned at each over-the-top detail. But a few minutes in, I noticed the atmosphere around me had shifted. The evening breeze outside had stilled. Silence pressed in through the open window—no distant lawnmowers, no dog barking, not even the usual birdsong at dusk. It felt as if the entire neighborhood was holding its breath. A prickle of unease crawled up my spine. Was everyone just tuned in to the prank, or was something else happening?

On the radio, the fake reporter’s account grew more urgent: *“It’s enormous… definitely not a plane. The police are moving in…”*

 His words were punctuated by a low rumble that rattled my windows. I sat up straight, pulse quickening. That sound hadn’t come from the radio. A vibration shuddered through the floorboards again, strong enough to make the lamp sway. 

I glanced outside, heart thudding. The sky, which had been clear moments ago, was now streaked with bands of purple twilight and… something else. Two bright lights hovered above the distant tree line, unnaturally still and too low for stars.

Maybe they were drones as part of the prank? As I watched, one of the lights began to drift closer, growing larger. It looked like a smooth oval with a pale green halo, gliding silently over the rooftops. In its glow, the street below lay deserted and unnaturally still.

There was no sound except for another distant rumble and the tinny voice from the radio. My mouth went dry. If this was a stunt, it was an incredibly elaborate one.

The announcer cut back in, his composed facade cracking: 

***“We have reports of similar objects across the country… Please remain indoors…”***

 His voice was almost drowned out by a burst of static. I grabbed the radio dial with shaking fingers and flipped through other stations—nothing but static on every channel. Even the AM band was dead air. My phone had no signal either. A cold weight formed in my stomach. I stood there in the middle of my darkening living room, lit only by the eerie glow from outside, trying to convince myself this was all part of the show.

A brilliant flash erupted on the horizon toward downtown, casting flickering light through my window. Seconds later, a sharp boom shook the house, knocking a picture frame off the wall. The power went out, plunging the room into darkness. 

••

The radio fell silent along with the lights, cutting off mid-broadcast. I was left with only the glow from that hovering object outside, now sweeping a pale beam over the street as if searching. In that ghostly light, I saw my neighbor across the road step onto his lawn, looking up in stunned disbelief. He was illuminated for an instant, face pale and eyes wide, before he turned and sprinted back inside.

I backed away from the window, heart hammering. This had to be real. It felt real—the floor still trembled, and I realized the air smelled of something burnt and metallic. How could a radio prank do any of this? How could it fill the sky with impossible lights?

In the silence, the radio suddenly crackled back to life, blasting a garbled noise that made me jump. The speakers emitted a distorted voice, but it was no longer the announcer. This voice was thick and wet, each syllable a guttural hiss that made my skin crawl. It spoke no language I knew. 

I realized with mounting horror that I wasn’t just hearing it through the radio—it was coming from everywhere, echoing down the street and from the sky above. The hovering craft pulsed with each alien word, like a dark star throbbing in time.

••

I clapped my hands over my ears and sank to my knees. The voice was inside my head, resonating in my bones. A pressure built behind my eyes, as if an immense presence were squeezing my mind. 

Through tears, I dared to peek out the window again. The clouds above were twisting, opening like a yawning chasm. Beyond them was not the night sky I knew, but a seething expanse of stars and darkness. And in that void, something was moving.

An eye emerged from the swirling gloom—huge, lidless, with an iris of molten gold and a pupil blacker than night. It fixed upon our town. Upon me.

••

I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. That gaze pinned me in place and laid my soul bare. In its depths I sensed an intelligence so vast and ancient that my mind buckled trying to comprehend it.

The voice from the sky rose in a terrifying crescendo, a cosmic howl that reverberated through the earth itself. Under that sound, I felt the walls of my house shudder and the floor tilt. My vision swam. I knew, in that final moment of clarity, that this was never just a prank. We had thought we were being clever, playing at an alien invasion for laughs. But in doing so, we had sent out a beacon. And something out there answered.

As the world around me dissolved into chaos—glass shattering, a chorus of distant screams, the very air humming with otherworldly energy—I curled into a ball on the floor. The last thing I saw was that impossible golden eye, widening as if in triumph. 

*On this April Fools’ night, the fools were all of us*

and we had invited something ancient and hungry into our world.
