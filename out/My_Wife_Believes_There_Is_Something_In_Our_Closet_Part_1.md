…

On the night before this all began, I had a nightmare. It is only now, after the events of that day and the horrors that have unfolded, that I have begun to recall it.

It's funny how the brain works like that sometimes. I am starting this with it because I've come to realize it was truly when this all began.

I could hardly recall it that morning, though its effects had seemed to linger well into my waking hours, an uneasiness that accompanied me well into my morning breakfast. Now, I find myself returning to it - like uncovering a lost memory, and I wonder if there is any hope for me.

In my dream, there had been a storm, the likes of which I struggle to even describe. It was as though the word itself had descended into a roaring nothingness of biting snow and wind. I knew, somehow that I was home, or near enough anyway, and yet also, that every step no matter where I turned seemed to bring me farther away, deeper into the frigid void.

It was cold, so cold it seemed as if the wind penetrated my very skin, settling upon my very bones, and all I knew was that I had to get out of this place. That’s when I heard it, like a song from somewhere within the roaring void, faint, but growing with each step I took nearer until I could make out something in the whiteness.

A door.

Standing firm and undisturbed as though unaware that there was no house around it, some distance away. That wasn’t all, I could feel something else, something coming from beyond the door, standing just ajar, through which I could see a slit of blackness as though somehow, there was something on the other side beyond the storm. I could feel a gnawing in me, something close to hunger yet only for the warmth that I knew lay just beyond the threshold. Before I could help myself, I was walking towards it…then I was running, with such speed and ferocity I felt more animal than man, a singular goal in mine - get to the other side, leave this place.

I awoke this morning, the contents of the nightmare beginning to fade to the back of my mind in an instant, though that unease seemed to linger, that and the cold in the air that morning. I didn’t even have to look outside to know that I would find snow on the ground.

I guess I’m rambling. I don’t know how to start something like this. A greeting feels...odd, given I’m alone while writing this.

Though I suppose at some point someone will be reading this if it's to be of any use to us.

It’s been almost 24 hours since this all began, and I find myself at wit's end, so I’m writing this with the hope that perhaps it may serve as a journal of Janice and I’s…situation.

My wife has never been the superstitious type, quite the opposite in fact. For as long as I’d known her, a little over a decade now, she’d been sharp, analytical perhaps to a fault.

Janice had always spoken at a mile a minute, explaining every detail of whatever it was that had caught her current interest, those brown eyes always seeming to pick the world apart with a sense of wonder and interest.

I’d always attributed it to her passion for the sciences, something I adored about her, and which had played in her favor in life given her career in archaeology. Working as both a professor and at times still a researcher in the field, she’d always viewed things from their most logical angle, never the sort to be swayed by myth or ghost stories.

And yet, over a period of hours, it seems as though I’ve lost her, to forces the very idea of which either of us would have laughed at mere hours prior. It’s almost strange how mundane today began, nothing in those first few hours to indicate the sudden shift things were to take.

Janice was, is, a professor of both chemistry and archaeology at the local college, something of a side job to keep her busy in between research sponsored by the college, when she was out doing the work that she truly loved. When she wasn’t teaching, her work varied between assignments for the two departments, something she’d always taken pride in as a sign of recognition for her ability.

She was brilliant, it was one of the things I loved about her, and it was clear her colleagues valued her for it, entrusting her to take part in what she always described as ground-breaking research.

Even if I never did understand what was so revolutionary about uncovering a few old arrowheads or used pick axes, I found her passion infectious. Her most recent assignment had begun almost three months ago.

As she’d told it, it had apparently been another venture of the Redbrook Community College’s surprisingly sizeable archaeology department, a three-week dig out in the center of the Redbrook Forest Preserve in search of artifacts; tools and other remnants of the people that had once called this place home long before us.

Her work on the project had ended a mere week prior, whatever it was they had her doing day in and day out at that school having kept her out of the house for a large part of the months proceeding, and sequestering her to the office when she was, writing countless papers and taking part in many a Zoom meeting behind closed doors.

Though she had always adored her work, in the past few weeks I could see exhaustion gnawing at her more and more, dinners finished in a hurry, and the hours she spent hunched over a laptop growing longer and longer until the project had ended. Even her sleep had suffered, the few hours she did spend in bed seemingly wracked with nightmares that made her mutter to herself, the contents of which she’d never cared to share or hardly remembered come morning.

I’d done my best to offer what little support I could over that time, though it helped little that my job kept me almost as busy, but I did my best to lend a helping hand. I had always admired that about her, the passion with which she dedicated herself to her job. Though she had the credentials to be working anywhere, she treated the little College of Redbrook and the responsibilities it seemed to heap upon her like Harvard, working with a dedication I could only hope to replicate. With her school having let out for its winter break that Monday, it seemed she’d been allowed a reprieve from the extracurricular work the college busied her with. She’d found herself left with almost three weeks of free time that I could tell she had been more than eager to take advantage of. I, on the other hand, had a busy day ahead. I work as an electrician for one of the local power companies.

A snowstorm had struck the town quite literally overnight. None of the weather channels predicted it, and half of the region got caught with its pants down. In its wake a myriad of neighborhoods were suffering from power issues, Janice and our own having been down for most of the early morning hours. The company I worked for was one of two in our small town that could handle such a thing, and the local government had contracted us to help get power back to everyone.

“I’ll be back around 8,” I’d told her on my way out the door, where she’d waited, still wearing her pajamas from the night before, complete with a thick gray bathrobe and coffee wafting steam from her favorite mug.

“And I’ll be here,” she said, smiling to herself following a quick sip of the coffee as if the very thought was amusing, “I’ve got to go over some of our findings from last week, write a post for the Historical Society, and then I’ve got a long, hot date planned with Dr. Meredith Grey and company,” she added, with a mock posh British accent.

“Well, do give the good Doc my warmest regards.” I returned, leaning in as she pulled me in for a kiss. “I’m thinking Thai for dinner, I’ll grab it after work, sound good?”

“I get the day to myself, and Thai food to end it? Have I ever told you I love you?” she smiled, and I could feel that warm sensation in me that had been there since the day we met, the singular dimple on the right side of her face that I had loved for as long as I’d noticed it visible.

I laughed at that, planting one final kiss on her cheek, above that little dimple before we gave our goodbyes, I was out and on my way to work.

It was the last normal conversation we had before…everything.

It was around 11:30 - 12:00 PM that day when I got a text from her that seemed…odd, though benign enough that I hadn’t given it much thought.

*‘Hey, did you leave the closet door open?’*

*‘In the bedroom? Nope, haven’t been in there today. Why?'*

It was a few minutes before she responded, and a few minutes longer before I was free to check sneaking a glance at my phone behind our truck during a bit of downtime.

*‘No reason. I had to grab something from the room and I noticed it was open, and I was just curious. Love you, have a good day :)’*

I returned her affections with a quick emoji, sliding my phone into my pocket as I returned to the day's work. It would be barely an hour later that I would feel the buzz at the side of my leg indicating another text.

“I’m gonna run to the bathroom, be back in 5,” I told Dale, my coworker, making my way towards the stairs out of the basement we’d been working in.

“Make sure you shut the door,” the older woman whose house we’d been working in called out from atop the stairwell.

She’d been watching us the entire time we worked, checking the power in her basement as hers was the only one on the block still out after hours of work. She’d perched there like a bird in a tree, nervous eyes watching us through a mess of gray hair, as she gripped a bathrobe shut around her.

“And stay away from the closet in the hallway,” she added quickly, those watery eyes locking onto me with an unwavering firmness that made the hair on my neck rise.

“Will do, ma’am.” I offered, tipping my hard hat as I slipped past her. It felt an odd request, and yet I’d had no intentions of doing so in the first place, and felt even less of a need to pry into the desires of the unwell old woman.

There was a strong smell, a nauseating mix of ammonia and whiskey which clung to her skin like an awful cologne, though it lingered through the entire house, which looked like it had gone months since it had last been cleaned. I gazed for a moment at one of the photos, through which a man peered back at me through an image grainy with the haze of time, his expression stern and serious, a military cap on his head.

Her husband, I could assume, likely gone now. A handsome enough guy, even through the sepia haze of old images I could make out a sharp jawline and defined features. His eyes were the most striking, affected by that condition that caused the irises to be two different colors, green and blue if the hazy image was any indication.

His wife stood beside him in several images, almost unrecognizable from the woman I’d seen drifting through the home, a bright-eyed smiling young lady who would have caught my eye at one time. She clung to him in the images, beaming with a look that could only be described as immense pride, and though he seemed the sort not to smile, even he cracked the odd grin.

They looked happy. It made the home I stood in all the more saddening in comparison.

A thick layer of dust clung to the photos as it did everything in the home, illuminated only by the light streaming through the few open windows, most of the others drawn shut, their curtains taped to the walls on either side.

The woman, Mrs. Aldridge, her name was, was hardly in better shape. Even in the relative gloom of the house, I could make out the dark bags under her eyes, and skin that looked paper thin clinging to bones. I felt sympathy for the woman, who’d likely outlived anyone whose job it would be to check on her, leaving no one to notice as her faculties declined and her condition with them. It seemed to have been weeks since she’d last bathed herself or even had a full meal.

I made a mental note that I should probably call the relevant authorities. By the look and smell of the place, she’d long since lost the urge or ability to care for herself. And it was more than just that.

All of the doors in the house sat open as far as I could tell, all but one, a single door I could see down the hallway shut firmly.

Curiosity stirred, and before I could determine why, I stepped closer, cringing against the creak of the floorboards beneath my feet as I stepped into the hallway. The wall was lined with photos, depicting a family over the years, most of which included a face I could hardly recognize as Mrs. Aldridge, seemingly taken lifetimes ago.

As I approached the door, I noticed immediately something unusual. It was held shut with a latch on the outside, a glance around confirmed that it was the only door in the house that did so.

I ran a finger over the latch, running my thumb and forefinger together after the fact.

“Barely any dust,” I muttered to myself.

The lock seemed new, the metal still gleaming, unperturbed by the same rust and wear of age that everything else in the home seemed to have. For reasons I couldn’t quite determine, I found myself feeling strangely uneasy with the revelation.

Thud.

A sound, from where - I couldn’t be certain, but it seemed like it had come from the other side of the locked door. I paused, so still for a moment that even my breathing ceased, as I listened, slowly drawing my ear against it.

There was nothing, for a moment, and then again, another low quiet thud from within, followed by the hiss of something being dragged along the floor.

I felt my heartbeat begin to quicken, swallowing hard against the sudden lump in my throat as I tried to make out just what I was hearing. Someone was inside, that much I was certain of, and apparently, locked in by Mrs. Aldridge.

“Hello?” I whispered, finding myself moved to action before I could think.

There was silence from the other end, for so long that I began to wonder if I had heard anything at all.

And then…

A whisper. Faint, so faint the words disappeared into a blur. I inched forward, ears perked to listen closer.

*Tap.tap tap****THUD***\.

A rush of footsteps from the other side, so quick I had hardly been able to react, pulling myself away from the door before something - someone slammed against the other side with such force the entire wall shook.

“Fuck,” I breathed, stumbling back into the opposing wall, heart racing with a nauseating force.

I stepped forward again, watching the door with an unblinking gaze as though whoever lurked behind might burst through at any moment with ill intent. With each step, the sounds on the other side grew louder, until I could make it out - a thick, hissing breath, bordering on a growl - like a cross between a big dog or a massive cat.

I felt my skin crawl, the sound so primal - so animalistic it made my fight or flight response want to trigger.

There was no escaping the realization that someone, something, was inside. A closet, she had called it, and yet I could have sworn that whoever lay on the opposite side of the door had run a distance far too large for any closet.

I felt my head spin at the questions being raised, but I had no time to consider any of them as I heard the creak of the basement stairwell, snapping me back into the very reason I was upstairs, to begin with. I hurriedly made my way back towards the living room, eager to finish the job as I felt the beginnings of a strange sort of disquiet beginning to knit its way through me.

“You didn’t open it, did you?” The voice from behind me nearly made me leap from my skin as I twirled to face it.

The woman stood before me, her eyes narrowed with suspicion, and yet somehow fear seemed to radiate from her.

“I - the door?” I asked sheepishly, swallowing hard against the embarrassment at the revelation that she’d somehow seen me.

“No, no I didn’t.” I offered.

She watched me, scanning my features as if searching for the truth before deciding she was satisfied with the response.

I knew I likely should’ve left at that moment, but curiosity and a need to see that no one was being harmed overtook my judgment.

“Is there…someone locked in that room, ma’am?” I asked though I was certain I already knew the answer.

For a moment, I could see something in her expression, something wavering between fear and hope. Her lips parted, as though she were about to speak, and then, in an instance it was gone. Mrs. Aldridge shook her head.

“No,” she sighed, “I’m the only other person in this house...I just - since the cold winds blew in I don’t go in there.” She shook her head, and I could see something swirling beneath those tired eyes - sadness, confusion, and longing all in equal measures.

“Anson he - he’s at work. He’ll be back soon. Soon. He wouldn’t want me to go in there.”

I nodded, curious but unwilling to pry. I didn’t recognize the name, it didn’t take much to gather it must be her husband. A glance around the house told me it was in poor condition, I couldn’t imagine any other person living in such squalor but I was in no position to push further, though I could feel the questions accumulating.

“And it’s not a room,” she added, her eyes meeting mine with an expression I couldn’t read, but made me feel uneasy all the same.

“The only rooms are upstairs. The only one anyone stays in is my own. That door leads to the hall closet.”

“Ah, I see. Must’ve been a dog or something,” I offered, my mind brought back to the sound of the breathing, wet and low and far from any sound a human should be capable of.

“I see, well, I’m sorry for the disturbance.” I finished, taking the opportunity to make my exit.

Before I could step outside, Mrs. Aldridge offered a final statement, mundane, though it filled me with an eerie sort of unease.

“I don’t have any pets, sir. I haven’t for years. It’s just me and my Anson…” her eyes seemed to fill with something at the name, a misty sort of forgetfulness I’d seen in my grandmother years prior in the earliest stages of her dementia.

For a moment, she seemed to gaze around the house, as though she were looking for something lost, a strange sort of desperation watering her gaze until it settled behind her.

Her eyes lingered for a moment on that closet door, and I could hear her mutter the name again, “Anson.”, hardly a whispered breath as though she’d recalled a lost memory.

She shook her head, the memory of the man I assumed to be her husband, present in all of the old photos that scattered her home, seeming to slip away in an instant.

“That storm,” she gestured to the open door, “It brought more than just snow on those winds to this little town of ours. Redbrook has always been an odd place, there’s no doubt, but never have I felt unsafe before. Now,” she sighed,

"This place just doesn't feel like home."

She peered back at the closet door, then to me, and for a moment I felt as though there was an unspoken plea. Still, I had no idea what I could do, and I had a full day ahead.

I nodded, making a mental note to call for a welfare check on the woman at some point.

I stepped outside, boots crunching atop the tightly packed snow, as I made my way to the portable toilet we’d set up a few yards away from the vehicles, sat on the only empty lot of grass amidst the cul de sac we were working in. The past few minutes ran through my mind, an odd and less discernible series of events that felt like something out of a strange nightmare, that woman’s words lingered all the while.

I could hardly remember why I was stepping out when the buzz of another text brought me back to the present.

I rubbed my hands together, doing my best to fight back the chill biting through my gloves before grabbing my phone and entering.

‘*There’s something wrong with the closet. It’s open again.*' Janice’s message read.

The damn closet again. I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of irritation at the interruption, which felt strangely unnecessary especially given how busy I was.

‘*Sorry to bother you at work, I was just hoping you could take a look at it when you get home, I think the hinges are loose or something.*’

I sighed, dismissing my momentary irritation as a side effect of the stress of work, the bitter Illinois cold, and my lingering unease from whatever had just unfolded in Mrs. Aldridge’s house. Still, I had several hours left of the work, and a few more jobs to get to before I could head home, and I couldn’t take a break to check my phone for constant updates about our apparently faulty closet.

*‘I’ll take a look.’*  I typed my response, adding, ‘*In the meantime, don’t worry about it. Put something heavy in front of the door until I can get back to fix it.’*

*‘Okay’* her response came quickly, as though she’d been waiting by the phone for me to text back.

*‘What time will you be back?’*

I found my mind returned to Mrs. Aldridge’s basement, the wires in the wall still exposed and needing to be covered, and after that, we had another two jobs needing completion before we called it a night.

*'A few hours. Why?’*

*‘No reason. Just want you home. It’s stupid, I know, but I’m just a little creeped out.’*

I felt a strange sense of unease, faint but lingering, like cobwebs clinging to my thoughts. Janice knew my schedule and she was aware of how busy the day was, it felt odd that she would ask. It seemed the situation with the closet was unnerving her for reasons I couldn’t begin to understand.

I felt a shiver grip me, only partially from the chill permeating the small space, but from the odd coincidence of it all. The day had been a long one, seemingly most of the town affected by the sudden storm, and it seemed to have left more than a biting chill in the air, a strange sort of surreality appearing to cling to every waking moment.

Still, I could be of little use to Janice from inside the port-a-potty, and the sooner I finished work, the sooner I could be back with her.

‘*I’ll be home soon. It’ll be alright.*’ I responded.

‘*If you need anything, text me.*’

I stepped out of the receptacle, trudging back towards the house as a strange cloud seemed to hang overhead. I felt motivated to get home sooner than usual. As I stepped back inside the house, immediately I felt that something was off. The air was thick with a suffocating sort of tension, the smell of burning ozone heavy.

It took only a few moments for me to notice the door in the hallway. It was open, its latch hanging uselessly from the wall, broken.

“Mrs. Aldridge?” I called, approaching the door with a rising sense of dread that I couldn’t seem to shake.

There was no response, nothing but a faint hum that hung in the air with a ghastly effect, a strange discordant tune. Though I couldn’t see who was making it, I could tell their voice seemed unusually deep.

“Mrs. Aldridge,” I called again, the strangeness of the situation forming a knot in my chest, a sort of unease I hadn’t felt since childhood gripping me.

“*I’m in here.*"

It was faint, hardly above a croaking whisper drifting from around the open doorway, barely audible beneath that odd humming that seemed to grow louder, but I could tell it was her.

But who was she in there with? The question sent a wave of disquiet through me that I couldn't understand.

“Is everything alright?”

The still faces in the dust-laden portraits that lined the walls seemed to watch me disapprovingly.

I’m not a small guy by any definition of the word, and Mrs. Aldridge couldn’t have weighed more than 90 pounds, and yet that voice…it was wrong, something in that odd hum almost mocking, the tune strange and otherworldly and yet…familiar. It frightened me more than I cared to admit.

And still, something, hubris perhaps, at the thought of being frightened off by some old woman or eerie tune, pushed me forward, driving me forth into yet another creaking step.

“Sir?” the voice came from somewhere over my shoulder, making me leap far more than it should have as I whirled to face it.

Mrs. Aldridge stood before me, looking almost every bit as frightened as I’d felt, eyes wide and hands outreached as if to try and catch me.

“I’m sorry, I - I didn’t mean to frighten you.”

“No,” I sighed, taking a moment to catch my breath and will my heart cease racing,

“No, I’m fine. Sorry, I - lost in thought.”

She shook her head, reaching out and placing a hand on my shoulder, eyes meeting mine with a look that told me she knew something more.

“No, it's alright. Ever since that storm, it’s like something bad blew in with the winds, and this *place*…” She shook her head once more, staring past me.

I turned to meet her gaze, my heart dropping into my stomach as I saw the closet door. It sat undisturbed, the lock unbroken. My head spun, the questions likely worn plainly on my face as I turned back to her.

“I just wish my Anson would come home from work,” she breathed, “It’s been so long.,” she laughed. It was a humorless, bitter sound.

. . .

The drive to the last job felt like a long one, much of my time spent staring at the road ahead, recounting those moments in Mrs. Aldridge's house. We’d left the old woman's home hours prior, leaving her to watch from the front window as our van pulled off out of the cul de sac.

The rest of the time in her house had passed without incident, we’d managed to get her power back on in an hour or so, much to her relief. However, all the time my mind was on that closet door. I was so certain I had seen the lock smashed, the door ajar, and those sounds…it had all felt so real, and yet…It made me wonder if I hadn’t gotten enough sleep the night before.

It’s strange how the mind attempts to paint over the impossible details in life, desperate not to disturb its comfortable understanding of the world.

We rode in silence to our next job, a fifteen-minute drive across the streets of Redbrook. The already quiet town seemed all but abandoned in the wake of the previous night's storm, the streets mostly unoccupied but for a sparse few.

Redbrook had always been an odd place, the kind of town it seemed even Google had forgotten. It, like most of the small towns in this area, had served as something of a living quarters for the families that had lived in the area when the Rust Belt was still shining steel, and the work was plentiful. Now, like so many other towns in the area, Cold Lake, Wraybrook, and others, it existed as a fading memory to the world around it, used only as a stopping-off point for the various families stationed at the nearby military base built where the old mill used to sit.

The area was the sort of place with as many ghost stories and urban legends as actual history.

I’d never been one for the ghost stories myself, not the sort to buy into the usual small-town myths, but it was on days like this that I found myself wondering…

We’d just arrived at our last job when I got the next text from Janice, and as I read her message from the passenger seat of the vehicle, I could feel every alarm blaring in my head.

*‘I think there’s something in the house.’*

“Give me a second,” I muttered to my co-worker as he stepped out of the vehicle.

“I’ve gotta call my wife.”

He nodded, shutting the door behind him as I quickly navigated to the call button. The phone rang, each chiming tone from the other end making my heartbeat quicken with suffocating anxiety.

“Hello?” she breathed.

I couldn’t be certain, but she sounded tired, practically sighing the word as though having just completed a marathon.

‘Hey babe,” I responded, trying to disguise the apprehension in my voice.

“Everything alright?”

I could hear a breath on the other end, shaky and silent, and though not a single word had been spoken, I could feel the cold bloom of icicles in my veins.

“I thought - I’m sorry, everything is okay, I’ve just been freaking out. I thought I heard someone upstairs…”

The embers of anxiety kindled hotter, a small blaze sparking in my chest at her words.

“What do you mean?” I ask, feeling the questions rise at a mile a minute, as though understanding could do away with the powerlessness I felt miles from home.

“Are you safe? Did you hear something? Did you see someone?”

“Yes, no, I -” she sighed on the other end, the sound long and infused with an unusual sort of heaviness.

“What’s wrong?” I pressed.

I could hear that something was bothering her, that much was excruciatingly obvious, there was an…edge in her tone the likes of which I hadn’t ever heard before. Janice had never been one to easily scare, ghost stories and the like always fell flat before her overly analytical mind, and even the real-life stories of horror never seemed to disturb her more than usual.

And yet now, now she sounded frightened, speaking with a tone I’d only ever seen reserved for health scares and that which could disturb her, and even then never with such palpable terror.

“I thought I heard a door slam when I was in the bathroom, so I thought you must be home,” she began, and in her voice, I could hear a wavering fear that made my stomach turn.

“I called for you, and obviously you didn’t answer but - god, I feel crazy but, I could swear I could hear someone…growling in the bedroom.”

Her words sent a chill down my spine that lingered before spreading out and into my very blood.

“I shouldn’t have looked, I know that was stupid but I thought you were playing some dumb prank and when I went in and saw the closet open again I was sure of it. ‘He’s being an ass I thought, teasing me about this closet thing.’ I called for you again, and again there was nothing, so I went and looked and,”

It felt like the knot in my throat threatened to choke me, my guts twisting into awful rings as I clung to her every word.

“It was empty. I don’t understand how, but it was empty. I could hear…something in there just…whispering and growling like some…some animal but the second I rounded the doorway to look. It was gone.”

She sighed again, the full weight of what she was saying somehow audible in the sound.

“I know how this sounds. It’s crazy, it sounds so stupid even saying this but - even though it looks empty, it doesn’t feel empty, babe. I don’t know how to describe it, and I don’t know what’s going on and it’s starting to freak me out. I just want you to come home soon.”

My mind weighed my options, my responsibilities to work balanced against the gnawing anxiety that had lived with me since the older woman's house that morning, begging me to return home.

The chill that hung in the air, the familiar garments of the Illinois weather, felt especially biting, the heat from the car long since fading out against the chill pressing inward until I could see my breath lingering before me.

“I’ll be home soon,” I said, the anxiety finally winning out,  “I’ll give Dale an excuse and head back after this last job.”

“Okay,” she breathed, and though I could hear the reassurance in her tone, it was cut with an equal measure of palpable unease that made me wonder if I wasn’t making the wrong choice, if I shouldn’t be there sooner somehow.

“I’m sorry, I don’t know why I’m acting like this. It’s freezing in here, and this storm, I don’t know -” she laughed, though there was little humor in the sound.

“It seems to have blown in something with the wind. Maybe I need some rest, you know I haven’t been sleeping well with work.”

Something in her words sent a chill racing towards my heart, like a pointed dagger buried deep. All at once, I recalled the words of the old woman, eerily similar, and I found myself adjusting uneasily in the truck. It was true since her increased workload had robbed her of her free time, it had seemed also to rob her of a good night's rest.

The past few weeks she’d been having nightmares of some sort, the kind that lead to muttering and tossing and turning and waking up somehow more tired than when you laid down the night before. And yet, somehow, this felt like something more than a lack of sleep, her words stirring something cold and uneasy in my chest.

“I’m coming home now.” I was speaking the words before I could determine against them, already stepping forth from my vehicle to move into the driver's seat.

“No, don’t - I don’t want to get you in trouble, it's just…listen, when you get back we have to talk.”

I could feel a familiar pit in my chest at those words, the trauma of past relationships triggering something of a fight or flight response in me.

“About?” I asked, “Did I do something wrong?”

“No, no, baby,” she sighed, as though trying to determine how best to explain some complicated matter to a child.

“I haven’t been being honest with you.” Her words sent chills rippling through me like a stone tossed into a frozen lake, all of the potential implications of her apparent dishonesty hitting like a ton of bricks.

“Honest about?” I tried to keep the obvious anxiety from my tone, but the effort was wasted.

“I didn’t cheat, or anything, I'd never do that to you,” she spoke as if she could hear my childish concerns over the phone.

“But there’s a lot I need to tell you about my work, about the past few months. And I can’t say it over the phone. Just…get here safe, okay?”

“Okay,” I answered, apprehension like a guillotine hanging heavy overhead. “I won’t pretend I’m not a little freaked out by that, I’m not gonna lie, but I trust you. Are you sure everything is alright? You’re okay?”

There was no reply, only a heavy sigh from Janice. For a moment I could hear only the faintest sounds of movement on the other end, somewhere distant as though in another room.

Janice gave a sharp gasp, and my stomach turned in response.

“Jan?”

“I’m fine,” she added quickly, “But I have to go. We’ll talk when you get home, but please be -”

There was a noise, a crash so resounding it sounded nearby even over the phone, followed by a continuous pounding sound.

“Janice are you -” I began, panic searing hot in my chest as I listened helplessly to whatever commotion was unfolding on the other end.

There was only the shrill beeping of a call ended, followed by silence. It wasn’t even a minute before I’d torn out of the driveway the work van was parked in, barreling through town and towards my home - towards Janice.

All the while my mind painted horrific scenes to fit whatever I’d just heard, my wife, falling victim a dozen times over in my mind to whatever masked intruders or maniacs I just knew had found their way into my home.

I committed to sending a text to Dale and our manager, making sure to have another van sent out to pick him up and offering a brief apology and some excuse, likely sickness on Janice’s part.

At that moment, the lingering unease that had lurked with me since that morning had avalanched into a suffocating dread, and I wished only to return home at that moment and to my wife's side.

The buzz of my phone snapped me back to attention as I saw the notification for a text, Janice's name hovering above.

‘*CalvinRodgers1991*’. I felt an immediate confusion at the message, a combination of my name and birth year, strange and entirely out of place for the conversation we’d been having, but still I took some brief solace in knowing she was at least alright, still able to text me despite…whatever I had just heard.

I sent a question mark in response, unwilling to take the time necessary to type out a question as my eyes wavered between the road ahead and my phone screen. Something was going on, what? I couldn’t begin to understand, but it felt very much like invisible gears were moving all around me, twisting and turning the world in dreamlike motions.

The drive back felt excruciatingly long, as though every red light had been triggered intentionally for the sole purpose of slowing my return, the apprehension swelling inside of me like a tidal wave with each second ticking by as I rode in silence.

The faint hum of the car and the wind outside served as the only sounds, a disquieting howl that was like dead wood to kindle the flames of my unease. The world beyond was pale and dead, the result of that storm which had come and gone so suddenly. Janice's words seemed to play again in my head followed by the end of our call, and I had to wonder what more had come with the ice and death of that storm.

The buzz of my phone from the cupholder beside me broke me from my concentration. I fully expected to find Dale’s name there or someone from work ready to chastise me for abandoning a job, but to my chagrin, it was Janice’s name alight on the screen.

“Hello?” I answered swiftly, raising the phone to my ear.

“Calvin?” I could hear her breathe my name though her voice was hardly above a strained whisper.

“Janice?” I called, voice shaky with the rush of anxious energy.

“I’m on my way, is everything alright?”

I awaited her response nearly suffocating with the tension I felt. My foot grew heavier on the gas, I was hardly five minutes away but it felt like hours, the distance between my house suddenly excruciatingly long despite how small the town was.

Her words came, breathed quickly, and hardly above a whisper, as though worried someone close by may be listening.

“It’s not me Calvin, I know what it will look like but it's NOT me. I’m so sorry, but you can’t trust her.”

At that, the line went dead.
