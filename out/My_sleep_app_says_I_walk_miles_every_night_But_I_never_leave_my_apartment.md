I'm a wreck, i'm sitting here in full mental breakdown, am i going crazy?  
A few weeks ago, I started using a sleep tracking app because I kept waking up exhausted. Not just groggy—*drained*. My muscles ached. My head was foggy. I’d check the clock expecting 3 a.m. and see 7:30 instead.

My girlfriend, Alina, said maybe I wasn’t sleeping at all. Maybe I was dreaming all night and didn’t notice. I joked maybe I was sleepwalking, but she gave me that look—the one where she’s not quite joking. We’ve been together three years. She knows my habits. She sleeps like a rock. Me? Lately I felt like I was wearing someone else’s skin by morning.

The app I downloaded uses movement and location tracking. It logs breathing patterns and walking distances too. Sounded high-tech enough to help me debunk whatever nonsense I was telling myself.

First night, I woke up to a ping:  
**“Distance walked: 8.3 miles.”**

That had to be wrong. I work from home. I didn’t go anywhere that day. I live in a one-bedroom apartment and barely get 5,000 steps total. I showed Alina and laughed. Probably a glitch.

She just said, “You don’t even have running shoes.”...Yes... I don’t walk. I don’t run. I’m a bit obese, and the idea of walking for miles? It’s really not me.

I checked the path it logged. It showed a loose loop—blocks and alleys near our building. Nothing consistent. The timestamp showed the walk occurred between 3:13 a.m. and 4:05 a.m.

The door was locked. Deadbolt and chain still in place.  
Okay, I figured. App’s full of bugs, its still in beta, i reported it as glitch.

Second night: **6.1 miles.**  
Third night: **9.7.**

I kept checking everything in the morning—front door, windows, the floor. No dirt, no footprints, no signs I left. But my legs still *felt* like I had. You know that faint soreness after a long walk? That weird, almost pleasant burn in your calves?

It started showing up every day.

On night four, I taped the front door shut with masking tape, just to be sure. Not because I was scared. I just wanted proof it was fake.

Next morning: **9.4 miles.**  
Tape? Untouched. Door? Still locked. Phone? Still on the charger by the bed.

I was actually *relieved.* Glitch confirmed.

But then I checked the route.

Unlike the others, this one didn’t loop. It spiraled—starting from our apartment and drifting further outward. It passed the old subway station, then an abandoned factory we’d driven past once. The final stop was near the edge of the city: a fenced-off housing complex called Ridgeview.

I didn’t think much of it until that night, when I went to plug in my phone and found it already off the charger, screen-down under the kitchen table. I *always* leave it on my nightstand. I thought - Okay, maybe I bumped it during the night.

Alina was staying at her sister’s that night. Some family thing. I decided to set up my webcam facing the bed. Old, low-res thing, but it worked.

Next morning, I felt like hell. Worse than usual.

I checked the footage.

Normal until 3:12 a.m., when I suddenly *sat up*. Not a slow rise—a *snap*. Like someone yanked me upward with strings. My face was turned from the camera, but I stood up, walked off-screen… then the footage cut to static for 53 minutes.

Came back at 4:07. I was back in bed, same spot, dead still.

App reading?  
**“0.0 miles walked.”**  
**“No movement recorded.”**

I called Alina. I didn’t want to upset her—I wasn’t even sure what was happening. I just said something weird was going on. Kept it vague.

She joked I was probably sleep-dancing. But when I asked if she ever noticed me getting up in the night, she got quiet. Then said:

“A few times… I thought you were in the kitchen. But when I got up to check, the lights were off. I figured I dreamt it.”

I went back and looked at the previous night’s path again. The spiral’s final stop? That Ridgeview complex.

I pulled it up on Google Maps.

It was abandoned. Condemned three years ago after a gas explosion. No one had lived there since.

Except… street view showed a unit on the fifth floor with a balcony identical to mine. Same railing. Same satellite dish. Same grill I bought on sale two summers ago.

I drove out there.

The building was surrounded by fencing and warning tape. The front doors were boarded, but the side entrance was open. I thought - Vandals had gotten there first.

Inside smelled like rot and mold. But I knew which stairwell to take. Knew which unit to go to. I didn’t even check the numbers. I just *knew*.

The door was unlocked.

Inside: a one-bedroom apartment. Same layout. Same brown couch. Same off-white rug with the coffee stain. And on the nightstand? My phone.

Not a phone—my phone! Same crack on the bottom left corner. I pulled mine out of my pocket to double-check.

Now I had two.

That’s when I heard the shower turn off.

I bolted.

I didn’t sleep this night. Didn’t even go home. I'm sitting in a 24/7 diner watching the sky turn gray, confused. Am I going insane? Was this real? Did I imagine it? Is this just all my paranoia?  
At 7:03 a.m., I finally got a text from Alina:

“Hey, you okay? Just got up. Everything good?”

I replied instantly:  
“Yeah. Just couldn’t sleep. Coming home soon.”  
\- i dont wan't her to think i lost it....

A few minutes passed.

Then she texted again:“Wait... how are you texting me?”  
“Your phone’s sitting on the kitchen counter.”

I’m still at the diner. Maybe she’s messing with me? Maybe I misunderstood?  
Maybe I’m just really tired.

But my sleep app just sent a new notification.
