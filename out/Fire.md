Would you rather live forever or know everything?

I wish this choice had been given to me. Unfortunately, I wasn't so lucky. 

It was a dark autumn day; The leaves rustled while the wind howled loudly as the setting sun served as a backdrop for its strange symphony. "It's cold", I said to myself as as I pulled my jacket tighter with one hand and held a leash with the other. My dog Daphne panting deeply, creating clouds of mist as we walked through the park near my house. I had always been lonely, so it was nice having a companion that truly enjoyed my company. 

As we walked I saw an old man standing in the path, still as a statue and nebulous as a ghost. I did 2 more rounds of the park and sure enough he was still there, watching, or maybe waiting. I'd always had a soft spot for old people; exacerbated by the fact that my grandmother had died just a few months earlier and as such I saw her in anyone over the age of 60. So I approached him. "Excuse me, sir, are you lost?", "can I help?", I said in a friendly tone. The old man turned towards me and for the first time I saw his eyes. A deep black; a black darker than a house with the lights off and no windows. They didn't just look past me, they looked through me so intensely that I felt like he could see my bones. 

"Hello, James", he said calmly, but somehow so loudly that my ears rang and my dog instantly began to bark and bare her teeth with a ferocity that I'd never seen her exhibit before. He gave my dog an annoyed look and snapped his fingers instantly causing her to stiffen, whine and collapse in a heap. "Daphne!!", I shouted, tending to my possibly dead companion and just as I looked up, the man had disappeared. I turned to look around but he was nowhere to be found; and just as I turned back towards her, I felt a hand clasp over my mouth and cold breath fill my ear.

"Do you want to be a God?"

I began to scream into his hand but for some reason, the sound could not escape my throat. It felt as though just as one hand gripped my face, another gripped my lungs so firmly that air could neither enter nor escape.

"DO YOU WANT TO BE A GOD!?", he repeated.

"Yes!" I tried to say; anything to end this nightmare. And just as I said it. Silence. The wind stopped howling, the leaves stopped rustling... There was silence. It felt as though the whole world stopped moving except for me and the monster that stood behind me. Suddenly his grip loosened and I fell to the pavement, immediately unconscious. Dreaming. Dreaming about things I'd never dreamt about, places I'd never seen, stories I'd never heard and languages I couldn't speak, all of which were burnt into my memory like a hot iron over silk and suddenly, I knew the man's name;

Satan,

Lucifer,

Belzebub,

Leviathan,

And just about every other moniker that this fallen angel went by. My mind was opened to the most disgusting, demented and evil things that went on in the world at that very moment and just as soon as it began, I awoke. The demon was no longer there, just me and my dead dog, whom I carefully picked up, but when I laid my hands on her, she began to breathe. Was this the power I'd been given? I quickly picked her up and ran home, bursting through my door and locking it behind me. 

I'd never been religious, but now I knew hell was real, I had seen it and trust me, you do not want to go there. So I prayed. I prayed and for the first time in my life I prostrated for a God that I'd never believed in. 

"Our father, who art in-",  I felt incredible pain. Fire. Fire in the same hands that were clasped together in prayer. Fire in my knees, fire in my chest and fire in my head. I fell to the floor as I felt the most debilitating pain I had ever experienced. I knew I had been forsaken

And that this was my life now.
