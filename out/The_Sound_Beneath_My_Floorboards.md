I bought the house because no one else wanted it.

Seventeen years empty. That should have scared me. It didn’t. I’d spent a decade scrubbing blood out of carpets for a living suicides, murders, accidents where people came apart wrong. Houses didn’t bother me. What people did inside them did.

The smell hit me the first night.

Not immediately only after the sun went down. It crawled out of the walls like breath from a corpse’s mouth. Sweet, sour, meaty. The kind of stink you only learn by standing over a body that’s been dead too long. I opened windows. Burned candles. Drank until I stopped caring.

That was when I heard it.

Chewing.

Slow. Wet. Purposeful.

It came from under the bedroom floor.

I lay there, staring into the dark, listening to something eat.

There was no scurrying. No frantic gnawing like rats. Just steady, patient mastication—cartilage being crushed, tendons snapping with quiet little pops. Every few seconds, a slurp, like a tongue pulling marrow from bone.

I counted the bites until I lost track.

When I finally sat up, the sound stopped.

Like it was listening back.

The crawlspace was clean. Too clean. No animals. No bones. Just a dark smear beneath the boards, sticky and almost black. I pressed my finger into it before I thought better of it.

It was warm.

I wiped my hand on my jeans and laughed it off. Houses rot. Old things leak. That’s what I told myself.

That night, I dreamed I was lying on my back, unable to move, while the floorboards above me peeled open like ribs. Shapes dropped down, landing on me with wet thuds. Mouths opened. Teeth descended.

I woke up screaming.

The walls were breathing.

Not metaphorically. I could see them swell and contract, slow and deep, like lungs full of moldy air. The pipes clicked in rhythm with something that felt like a pulse. The smell was stronger now rotting meat mixed with copper and bile.

On the fourth night, I woke to weight on my chest.

I couldn’t breathe.

The floor beneath my bed bowed upward, wood creaking, nails screaming as they bent. Cracks spiderwebbed outward, and something shoved through from below.

A finger burst through the boards.

Gray. Bloated. Skin splitting open to show meat underneath.

Then another.

The hand followed, ripping the wood apart as it clawed upward. Boards shattered, and something hauled itself into my room.

It looked like a man that had been buried wrong.

Its skin hung off it in loose, translucent sheets. I could see muscle flexing underneath, slick and red. Its jaw hung too low, unhinged, tongue swollen and blackened. One eye had collapsed into its socket; the other stared straight at me, milky and starving.

The smell made me gag.

It lunged.

Its teeth sank into my shoulder with a crunch that vibrated through my skull. I felt muscle tear. Felt bone scrape against enamel. Blood sprayed the wall, hot and arterial, as it tore free and chewed loudly. Joyfully.

I screamed until my throat tore.

Its fingers dug into my stomach, nails ripping through skin like wet paper. I felt myself open. My guts spilled out, steaming, sliding over its hands and onto the floor. I could feel everything the slick drag of intestines, the cold air kissing places that should never feel air.

The thing shrieked, ecstatic.

Then it stopped.

Its head snapped toward the hallway.

Something else was moving beneath the floor.

The creature hissed afraid.

It dropped me like spoiled meat and scrambled back into the hole, dragging itself down as the boards pulled closed behind it. Wood knitted together with a sound like chewing gum and cartilage.

I lay there, choking on blood, my organs pooling between my fingers.

The house would not let me die.

I woke up on the couch.

Whole.

No wounds. No pain. No scars.

The blood was gone. The floor pristine. The walls clean.

But the smell remained.

When I looked in the mirror, my reflection blinked a heartbeat after I did.

I pressed a hand to my chest. The heartbeat didn’t come from me.

It came from the walls.

When I coughed, a sliver of bone fell out of my mouth and clattered onto the sink.

I knew then what the house was doing.

It wasn’t killing me.

It was using me.

Mrs. Calder came by the next day to complain about the smell.

She didn’t leave.

I heard her screaming through the floor while I stood frozen in the kitchen. Heard bones snap. Heard something slurp the soft parts out first. When it was done, the house sighed a long, satisfied exhale and the smell lessened.

That night, I felt stronger.

My skin was tighter. My hunger sharper.

By the end of the week, the neighborhood was quieter.

I don’t clean crime scenes anymore.

I make them.

And when I lie in bed at night, listening to the chewing beneath the floorboards, I realize the truth far too late.

The house doesn’t want me to leave.

It wants me to eat.
