While sitting next to Elise, I caught the musicians’ hostile glances directed at me. They were probably expecting me also to be in a trance just like Elise, but I was wide awake, alert and in full touch with reality. 

I had clearly disrupted their plans, and they made it obvious I wasn’t a welcome presence on the bus. 

Then two of the musicians slowly began to approach me with a threatening intent, but I lifted my cross in readiness. The sight of it made them recoil, forcing them to eventually retreat back to their seats.

I tried to wake Elise, who sat in a trance, staring into a void. I even chanted a few mantras, hoping to break her out of it, but nothing seemed to work.

Meanwhile, the bus seemed to continue on its familiar route after departing from the train station, and was now headed towards its next stop—the Vintage Movie House. 

There was one key difference this time, though: it didn’t stop at the movie house but continued to drive past it, heading next towards Grace Supermarket, followed by the local gas station before finally looping back to the bus stop near St. Mary’s Hospital, the exact spot from where Elise had boarded the bus a week earlier.

 I observed silently that the bus had just completed the pentagram ritual and I secretly wondered what would follow next. 

But something strange happened as the bus passed the hospital, and continued to move without stopping.

Elise suddenly snapped back to her senses, breaking free from her trance. Panic spread across her face, as she looked wide awake and fearful. 

Thankfully, I was sitting right beside her, ready to help and calm her down. 

“Hello, Elise. I’m Harrison Ward, a paranormal investigator. Your father, Mr. McDonald, sent me to rescue you. Don’t worry; I’m here to get you back to safety. But first, I need your help. Do you know where we’re headed next?” I asked, as the bus began to slow down at a traffic stop.

She nodded, sweat dripping down her forehead. “Toll Gate. I am supposed to get off at the toll gate. All passengers have to leave the bus when another one climbs on board,” she explained, referring to me.

“Do you know where this toll gate is?” I asked, straining to listen.

She nodded, fear etched across her face as she pointed with her hand, and at that moment, I understood why the bus had stopped. 

I turned to my side and saw an old, abandoned building with a massive wrought iron gate in front. An old sign above read "Abagnale Mental Asylum," sending a chill down my spine. 

This was exactly the spot where the cops had discovered the bodies of previous passengers. 

Suddenly, as the bus slowed near the traffic light, the driver began revving the engine hard, sending thick plumes of smoke billowing around us, quickly filling the air with an oppressive haze.

Our visibility plummeted, and we started coughing as the smoke thickened around us. 

The driver then slammed the accelerator, and the bus suddenly lurched forward at full speed, even as we all were completely shrouded in smoke.

Moments later, it came to a sudden halt in front of a large toll gate in the middle of the road. There was nothing else on either side of the gate—no cars, no passengers—nothing except the midnight bus parked in front of it. 

My eyes immediately gravitated toward a man dressed in a security uniform seated in a booth near the gate.

“The Toll Collector……,” I silently muttered under my breath, recollecting what the old man in the nursing home had said, and I immediately felt an uneasy feeling in my stomach.

 Suddenly the environment around us became deathly silent; I could smell fear all around me. 

It was not just me or Elise, even the musicians who were busy glaring at me all this while, were now cowering in their seats. 

But the worst affected seemed to be the driver. He looked absolutely panic stricken.

 Infact, I noticed he wasn’t pale and white looking like the musicians, he looked more like me or Elise. He was actually human!

The driver slowly rose from his seat, turned toward Elise, and said, "Your stop has arrived. You need to get off the bus."

As Elise began to stand, I grabbed her hand, urging her to stay seated.

 “She is not getting down anywhere,” I shouted. “ She is going to continue to stay here in the bus next to me.” 

I watched the color drain from the driver’s face as he seemed to wrestle with the dilemma of confronting me. His shoulders finally slumped, and he stepped off the bus, walking over to the booth where the security guard was seated.

From where I sat, I could hear the guard’s irritated voice ask, “Why are you here? Where is the passenger?” 

The driver leaned in and whispered something I couldn’t quite catch, but the guard’s reaction was immediate. He sprang to his feet and strode outside the booth, visibly looking very angry.

Then, to my horror, I watched as the guard’s torso began to expand, his uniform ripping apart as his form began to change. 

He transformed into something monstrous—a towering, demonic figure with the head of a crow, a human-like torso, with enormous claw like hands, and vast black wings that folded along his back.

The creature clamped its massive, clawed hands around the driver’s face, squeezing until his eyes bulged and finally burst, the driver’s terrified screams filling the air. 

With a single brutal swipe, the creature next tore the skin clean off his face, leaving him shrieking in agony.

The demon then leaned in close and drew in a deep, ghastly breath, sucking the driver’s very soul from his body. 

In one final act of savage brutality, he yanked the driver’s head from his shoulders, and let the body drop lifeless to the ground.

I finally realized why he was addressed him as the toll collector and why everyone was so petrified of him. He took people’s souls.

 I could already feel beads of sweat forming around my forehead as well.    

The Toll Collector then climbed onto the bus, his taloned finger extending to point at Elise and me. 

His menacing voice echoed through the vehicle as he warned, “If you don’t get off now, your fate will be far worse than the driver’s.”

 I could feel Elise trembling beside me, but I wasn’t about to back down. Not now against this monster.

I stepped forward, defiant even as I felt fear rippling through my veins. 

But my act of defiance only seemed to enrage the creature further as he lurched toward me, his dark form swelling with anger. 

I moved quickly as well, slamming into him with all my strength, and together we crashed through the windshield, shattering the glass as we tumbled outside. 

I held my cross tightly in one hand, and as I faced off against the creature, he paused, taken aback by my resistance. 

He hissed, his eyes burning with fury, as he called out to the musician-ghosts. They rose from their seats and surrounded me, their spectral forms closing around me in all directions.

Now outnumbered, I fought them off one by one, but they clawed and tore at me, pressing me down. As they overwhelmed me, the cross slipped from my grip, clattering to the floor. 

I then felt a cold, merciless hand wrap around my head, squeezing until pain shot through my skull. 

My vision blurred, and I could feel my eyes threatening to burst from the pressure as I screamed in agony.  

Just as the Toll Collector leaned in, ready to steal my soul, I reached for the amulet around my neck—a talisman my grandfather had gifted me, one he claimed held magical powers of protection.

Gripping the amulet, I felt a surge of energy suddenly rip through my body.

The demonic being was blasted backward, flinging 10 feet in the air. 

I held up the amulet, and a burst of light exploded from it, tearing through the musician-ghosts around me, freeing me from their grasp. 

With renewed strength, I seized the cross from the ground and charged at the Toll Collector. 

Beams of light poured from the cross, piercing his form as he writhed in agony. The dark creature let out a final, blood-curdling scream as his body disintegrated into a cloud of feathers that scattered to the ground. 

With the Toll Collector’s gone, the musicians’ ghostly forms also began to soften, their faces showing relief as the curse of almost a hundred years was finally lifted. 

They thanked me with a nod, each dissolving into the night air as they vanished, leaving Elise and me alone in silence.

Elise and I looked around, finding ourselves stranded on the road in the middle of nowhere, with only a large toll booth looming in front of us. 

Suddenly, I remembered the bus tickets. 

Moving toward the Toll Collector’s booth, I found a large box of collected tickets. I lit a match, setting the entire stack ablaze. As the flames consumed the tickets, the world around us began to spin, colors swirling, until everything went dark.

When I opened my eyes, I was back on an empty bus with Elise, parked in front of the Abagnale Asylum. I heaved a huge sigh of relief to be back on familiar ground. 

When Mr. McDonald finally reunited with his daughter, he was overcome with emotion, his eyes brimming with gratitude. I felt a deep sense of happiness knowing I had helped them, and as I began my drive back home, a warm satisfaction settled over me.

That night, as I lay in bed, my body bruised and my mind utterly exhausted, I drifted off to sleep the moment I closed my eyes. I found myself standing before the Abagnale Asylum, a slow laughter suddenly cracking through the stillness. 

The massive wrought iron gates swung open, beckoning me toward the crumbling structure cloaked in twisted vines and overgrown shrubs. 

Inside, I wandered through shadowed halls, until I reached a locked door at the end of a darkened corridor.

 “You think you have solved the mystery have you?” a voice called out as a laughter ominously echoed through the air. 

I jolted awake, sitting upright in bed, sweat trickling down my forehead. Reaching for a glass of water , I noticed a single crow feather resting on my bedside table.
