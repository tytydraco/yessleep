I met this weird guy named Unter from Britain or something in college. He was kind of a mystery too me at least, but he drove a dark burgundy Volkswagen Karmann Ghia. It was SO—-FUCKIN’----COOL!!!!!!!! I am kind of a fucking dumbass, but I love cars. I drive a 240SX personally and working on cars is all I want to do in life. I went to college with a baseball scholarship but baseball for me is work now… Cars are how I live. Anyways I went to college for about a year and me and Unter became fast friends because he loved cars almost as much as I do. We would talk all the time about what engine oil we used or how we styled our cars. Unter would always get on my ass about the mods I did to the 240 and would always tell him he should do more to his ride.

“The Karmann would look fuckin’ bitchin’ if you slammed it man.”

“I would never,” is what he would say “a car is an art piece my friend, I wouldn’t modify the Mona Lisa” he would say. I miss the guy, but I still disagree.

One day after talking entirely through our psych class about types of gas (don’t ask) I invited him to this party off-campus at my rich friend Matt’s house. It was big, two stories tall, white, and they probably went crazy at Christmas time. 

Anyways I showed up and the place was fucking popping man. RGB lights shooting out the windows, pure crowd noise underscored by Blinding Lights by The Weeknd, and I am not fucking around but there was a layer of dry ice creeping along the floor and out the front door. This place had a pure party vibe I tell yuh. I walked in and it felt almost dangerously intense so like anyone would do I dove in. In the morning, I realized that good ole’ Unter didn’t show. Unter was a mysterious fella, but he loved partying, so I was a little worried. But I was more worried about the thumping hangover in my brain and eyes and… ears? I headed home to deal. I definitely had homework that night but I also had a hangover so I made a “mini fringe dorm room prairie oyster” (look it up) and I went to bed. Which is what I thought I was going to do but I saw a nice little envelope on my desk. “I didn’t put that fucking there” I thought. I opened and it read…

“Hello T—s, if you get this letter, I am dead. I didn’t know you well, but even so you are the only person I trust with the Karmann. Do whatever you want to it. But if you deny it love or God forbid sell it, I’ll haunt you        Mr. S—h.” -Sincerely Unter Kurl.

There was a P.S that said READ BETWEEN THE LINES and a bunch of numbers attached. This shook me up. I had just been with the guy. I didn't agree with him always, but he was probably my best car friend, and you don’t meet passionate people too often. On the other hand, I don’t like math and I don’t do math on weekends. It’s part of my fucking code nerds! I decided to go to sleep for now and deal with it later. 

Then came the problem. I was thirsty. I had just gotten all comfy in bed then my mouth turned into the goddamn Gobi Desert. I angrily got out of bed and I realized that my water bottle wasn’t there. I got even more angry. “It must be at the house,” I grumbled. I stepped my way to the house like a zombie. (slow not fast) I got there and it was like the apocalypse came through, trash all around, a few broken windows, and an open front door. I didn’t give a shit though, I was hungover, tired and my friend was apparently dead.

I walked through the house, and I remembered vaguely leaving my water bottle in the back. So, I walked to the backyard and passed by the living room which contained many dormant party guests including Matt, the host. Once in the backyard I saw the disgusting pool and the pizza that had sunk to the bottom, the solo cups in the grass, and toilet paper on the house and the shed. Matt had a giant shed in his backyard. I was curious and I thought that maybe my bottle was in there. I opened the big barn doors and I looked around. It was a workshed and it had workshed stuff. I was poking around the tools and then I started to hear a noise, but it wasn’t clear enough to make out and it sounded vaguely electrical. I walked around the shed like an idiot for ten minutes before realizing it was coming from below my feet. 

I looked around and I spied a hatch handle, and I descended about 5-6 feet down and I couldn’t see shit. When my eyes adjusted, I saw an industrial light switch and I flipped it… 

“Good god…” I said out loud on instinct 

It was the Karmann with a body in the driver seat. The body was stiff and charred and burned out, it looked like it was hit with a nuclear weapon. All aside I knew who it was as unrecognizable as he was and I’m sure you know too.

“How the fuck did this happen to him?” I said in fear

I climbed back up much quicker than I went down, and I exited the shed and then I stopped. They were all watching me. All 50 something party guests were in the backyard and staring at me like hungry animals 

“Good morning T—S, what are you doing?” said Matt at the front of the pack.

“Nothing, just looking for my water bottle,” I trembled out.

“What are you going to do?” Matt announced. 

“Leave?”

Matt shook his head and then silence. All 51 people including me were silent as can be. Then they swarmed me. They swarmed me like starving wolves, almost desperate as if my death meant life for them and my continued existence was poison. I impressed myself in a bid for survival when I climbed up the shed and jumped over the fence and I ran all the way to the dorm. I should’ve just gone to sleep.
