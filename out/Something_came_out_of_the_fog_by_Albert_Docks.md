(Sorry if this is a bit long, I just need to get it out somewhere. I haven’t told anyone this before.)

I know this sounds like bullshit, but I swear to god it happened. I’ve been sitting on this for years, and every time the fog rolls in off the Mersey, I can still smell it.

It was late October, a few years ago. I was in Liverpool for the weekend with my girlfriend and some mates. We were staying near Albert Dock. Everyone else was still asleep, but I woke up early and couldn’t get back to bed, I've always had insomnia. I decided to take a walk down the waterfront and yeah I had a couple of joints.

The city was dead quiet. The fog was so thick it looked solid. The kind that swallows light instead of reflecting it. I sat down on the edge of the dock with a cheap fishing rod I’d bought the day before at a car boot sale in Speke. I wasn’t expecting to catch anything. I just wanted to relax a bit by the river.

And that’s when it happened.

A ship came out of the fog. Not sailing, just moving like it was gliding, It didn’t make a sound. It looked wrong, it looked and felt idk like it was made from something unnatural. The sails hung in strips, the masts bent and splintered. It drifted toward the dock and bumped against it with this soft, damp thud.

Then the fog around it changed. It wasn’t just mist anymore. It was heavier, wet in the throat, and it fucking stank. The smell was the worst thing I’ve ever known. Like old blood and rotting meat, if you've ever put meat in the bin for a bit and forgotten it then you'll know the smell I mean. It felt thick enough to chew.

That’s when I realised there were shapes moving on the deck.

They climbed down into the water, slow and deliberate. It was obvious straight away that they weren’t people. I don’t even know what they were. Their bodies looked like tar, dripping and shining, almost see-through in places. The limbs were long and stringy, the skin seemed to be dripping from them.

And their faces. Jesus Christ. Their faces were blank. No mouth, no eyes, no nose. Just smooth black sludge stretched tight over bone. But in the hollows where eyes should have been, two points of white light burned. Not glowing but fucking burning.

One of them stopped and turned toward me. I heard its neck twist. Not like a normal turn. It cracked, the snapping sound was like a tree branch cracking.

I couldn’t move and I'm not ashamed to say I thought I was either going to piss myself or throw up. I just sat there, shaking. I could hear them walking. The sound of their feet peeling off the stone. They just walked passed me and kept going, straight into the fog, toward the city.

Then it was over.

The ship was gone. The fog thinned out. The air felt normal again, but the smell stayed on me for days. I threw my clothes out in the hotel bin because I couldn’t stand it anymore.

I didn’t tell anyone. No one would believe me anyway.

But sometimes, when I walk home for work late and the fog is sitting low, I swear to God I see shapes moving in it. Just shadows, and I can smell that same rot.

If you live near the docks, stay inside when the fog comes in thick. Don’t go near the waterfront.
