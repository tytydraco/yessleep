My friend Kieran and I often travel together for weeks at a time. He is the best travel companion and my little brother from another mother; we love visiting the same places; we are both easy-going, accommodating, and adventurous, with a keen sense of each other’s needs. 

It was not unusual for us to be set up together in an Airbnb in Berlin. We both speak fluent German and, while we usually stay in Friedrichshain, the neighbourhood we are most familiar with, this time we couldn’t find anything to our liking and decided to stay in an atypically posh apartment building in West Berlin. 

I had an inexplicable feeling of unease when I first entered the apartment on my own. It was in a clean, quiet, and new apartment complex clearly intended for wealthy inhabitants, completely unlike the East Berlin Soviet-style flats we were so accustomed to. Security was tight; I needed a key to enter the complex, a second key to activate the lift, a third key to open the door to our hall, which included three other apartments, and finally, a fourth key for our apartment door itself. A last detail, which is relevant to what was about to transpire for poor Kieran and I, is that apartment dwellers are able to buzz in visitors and delivery drivers at the very front of the complex; their last names (e.g. Schuppert and Wolkenstein) are hand-written on a button that will ring their doorbell. Nevertheless, because of the multiple layers of security, they will have to meet the visitor or driver downstairs, outside the lift. 

And yet something was *off* about the apartment building. It was embellished with odd details like a row of laughing Venetian masks framed on the walls that you had to walk past on the way to the lift. If you peered behind the pillars on the ground floor, you would see sculptures of demonic figures from folklore of unknown origin. And right in front of the entrance to our maze-like hall, which was decorated with floor-length mirrors all the way so that you could not escape the sight of yourself, was a marble statue of a heavily pregnant woman with no head. Around me was dead silence; no sounds of children playing or adults arguing. More than a little unsettling? Maybe. Tacky? Most definitely. As Kieran finally arrived by train from Switzerland, I greeted him downstairs, and sensitive as he was, I knew he was also somewhat uncomfortable with the decor. We tried our best to lighten the mood. “Cultural appropriation,” Kieran declared archly, pointing at the statues, which hadn’t escaped his notice.

Since it was our first night together this summer, Kieran and I had much to catch up on. We wandered around the neighbourhood to obtain our bearings; it seemed charming and safe enough, if rundown and shabby in a way I didn’t associate at all with West Berlin. Lots of buildings appeared abandoned and shops permanently shut. I snapped monochrome photos with my new camera, and soon we were drinking beers outdoors with mediocre pasta, without a care in the world. 

By the time we returned to our apartment for the night, still in a state of drunken revelry (albeit a touch more subdued), it was nearly midnight. Kieran got us in, successfully, with all four keys. We sobered up and sat around the dining room table, turning to more serious matters. I should note that we were speaking at a regular volume, the tone of an intimate late-night conversation between old friends, with the knowledge that the walls were very thick — for we had not heard a peep from the neighbours who shared our corridor all day. That is, if they even existed. The only thing we could be reasonably faulted for, perhaps, was the occasional uncontrollable belly laugh. 

Fifteen minutes past midnight, we were startled by the sound of the doorbell. I am not sure how normal this is, but for both Kieran and I, we believe you should be very careful about who you open the door to late at night — much less if you’re in an unfamiliar and heck, eerie building. We practically jumped out of our chairs and padded hesitantly to the door to examine the unexpected visitor — only to realise that the front door had a bizarre design flaw. There was no peep hole through which we could see who had chosen to ring our doorbell at this hour. In all my years of travel, I had never encountered a front door like that before. Moreover, due to how the visitor system was set up, we couldn’t be sure if somebody was ringing from the outside of the complex or outside our front door. While we stared at each other, wondering what to do, the doorbell rang again.

I have to admit that my heart was racing, as innocent (and possibly justified) as the ring may have been. Kieran got on his knees and tried to look under the door to see if he could make out the shoes of the person. But the narrow gap between the door and the carpet was so minuscule that all Kieran could observe was that the hall light *had* been switched on. There was no doubt that we had a stranger standing outside the front door. As if to remind us of this, the doorbell rang once more. 

Kieran and I moved silently to a corner of the living room, and whispered to each other. “Is that a noise complaint, do you think?” I asked. Kieran shook his head firmly, and I could see that he was quivering slightly. “We weren’t being loud at all,” he said. “And besides, Germans are direct about this kind of thing. If we woke someone up, they’d pound on our door and yell ‘Sei ruhig!’ or something.” There was something very discomfiting about the three purposeful rings, and how they were spaced apart, accompanied with nothing but dead silence. 

We waited a good ten minutes, until we were fairly certain that the mysterious nightcaller had gone away. Kieran plucked up the guts to look under the door again. This time, the corridor was pitch dark. Nobody was there. We didn’t dare to open the door, but I made sure it was double-bolted from the inside. 

As our adrenaline wore off, Kieran and I decided that we should probably write off the incident as a mistake, and start getting ready for bed, as we had plans to meet a friend at Café am Neuen See early in the afternoon. We began to unpack our things and get settled in, and things began to feel normal enough, although we spoke only in hushed voices. It was most likely a noise complaint, I thought. But the neighbour had clearly given up rousing an apology from us, and was probably already fast asleep, not caring how bothered they had made us. 

Nothing could have prepared me for what happened next. By this time, it was easily half past one. I was getting ready to brush my teeth, and Kieran had gotten comfortable in the fold-out bed, when the doorbell rang for the fourth time. We instantly froze. A fifth time, and a sixth time. The visitor was getting impatient, it seemed. Kieran stealthily edged towards the door and knelt to examine the hall light. Pitch darkness once again. And then, abruptly, there began a series of knocks. The knocking was firm, gentle, and consistent in its rhythm. The fact there was no overt hostility somehow made it worse. 

“Do we open the door?” Kieran asked hoarsely. I shook my head. “I can understand the first three rings. But if they came back after an hour, and they’re standing in the dark, knocking for us to answer, we’re not dealing with any regular noise complaint. Or person, for that matter.”

The knocking, thankfully, came to an end. But Kieran and I were so spooked that we found it hard to settle back down. Whatever it was, I felt deep in my heart that our minor ordeal was not yet over. I tried my best to think. Given the extraordinarily tight security of the building, in order to even access our doorway, the person would have to be one of our immediate neighbours. That would make sense if we had been speaking too loudly. But why would they return an hour later whilst standing in the dark, especially given our unwillingness to answer? Plus, Kieran and I had already switched off the lights in the living room and kitchen, and to anyone looking into the apartment, we might as well have been asleep. 

From our balcony, Kieran and I had a view of the windows of the other apartments that shared the same hallway. Was anyone else awake? What if the unexpected guest were a lonely insomniac searching for someone to speak to at night? We loved Berlin for its harmless weirdos, after all. 

We didn’t want to alert anyone who could be watching by opening the glass door to the balcony and stepping out, so we climbed out of the half bathroom window and crouched on the balcony to look. In those other units, however, it was darkness and silence all the way down. We laid still in wait, to see if we could sense any movement. 

Kieran was utterly convinced that someone — likely the unwanted stranger — on the ground floor was using their phone. Indeed, from where we were hiding, I could make out a bright little rectangular screen on the ground floor, and nothing more. Was someone texting? Googling ways to break in? If there was a shadowy figure holding up their phone, they had to be standing *very* still. I began to smile. “It’s a keypad,” I murmured. “There isn’t anybody there at all — not a soul. We can check this in the morning.”

It took considerable persuasion for Kieran to agree to climb back inside with me — he kept swearing that he could see fingers swiftly tapping away at the little screen. I was afraid he would spend all night watching for suspicious activity, but I managed to calm him down. 

It was past 2am by this stage. Kieran collapsed back into his bed and drew the covers up to his chin, looking very pale. Knowing how anxious Kieran could be, I knelt by his bed and whispered to him soothingly. “They aren’t coming back at this hour. The door is bolted. *And* if they do, we’ll shout something rude in German. They’ll yell back, and then we’ll figure out who they are and what they want from us.” Kieran nodded and closed his eyes, breathing deeply. I sat by him for a moment longer. But the episode, as I had guessed, was not yet over…

We heard the now-dreaded sound of the doorbell ringing and grabbed each other instinctively. This time, it rang *three more times in a row* with the same deliberate pace. Kieran sprang out of bed immediately and looked under the door. No hallway light. *Please don’t knock*, I prayed, as I confirmed the number for the Polizei and texted my husband what was happening to Kieran and I. “If we’re stabbed by Norman Bates tonight, know that I love you,” I wrote. 

My husband called me immediately out of concern. Kieran and I stepped into my bedroom so that the night visitor wouldn’t hear us all speaking. After hearing the details, my husband tried to come up with harmless theories. “Could a delivery driver have gotten lost in the building?” he asked. I couldn’t rule out the possibility, but Kieran and I both thought it was extremely unlikely. We hadn’t seen any sign of a Wolt vehicle outside on our way back in, and while the building layout was confusing, the person had navigated it well enough to *come back twice* — in the dark, no less. Moreover, the lift was located directly outside of the hallway door. There was no missing it. 

Kieran’s best attempt at a reconstruction, which my husband and I agreed with, was that one of our neighbours had hosted a party to watch the Euros match that night and continued to invite other people over in its aftermath. Kieran and I remembered we had shut the hallway door behind us very carefully, and because of the lock on it, the party host *had* to have been one of our immediate neighbours — that is, someone who occupied the very same hallway as us. 

While leaving the party, a guest, who was likely smashed, might have left their phone at the host’s apartment or simply forgotten how to walk out of the mirrored, maze-like hallway, gone back to the party venue, and mistaken our door for their host’s. (Kieran noted that something like this had happened to him before in a hotel.) What’s more, because there was no knocking on the third — and thankfully final — time, we had absolutely no evidence that the visitor had been in our hallway — a random miscreant might have rung the bell from *outside* the apartment complex. For all we knew, everybody in the complex might have had their bell rung by drunk football fans wandering the streets. 

In any case, the three incidents might easily have been unrelated — there was no proof that the same enigmatic individual was behind it all. In his irreverent way, my American husband joked that, instead of shouting in German, Kieran and I should pretend to be American, should there be any further disturbances. “Americans are much scarier than Germans, because we’re crazy and we have guns,” my husband remarked, making Kieran and I chuckle. “Tell them — do you know what Americans do to night intruders? We shoot ‘em.” Kieran played along with his best impression. “We are Americans, and we are armed,” he said with a commanding Southern twang. 

Having a third person’s perspective certainly helped to keep our collective paranoia in check, and it was not long after that I could hear the familiar sounds of Kieran snoring softly outside my room. I had been so worried about his nervous disposition. But as I got into bed and coaxed myself into a fitful sleep, I couldn’t help but poke holes in Kieran’s hypothesis. We had heard no rowdy party that night, no pattering of feet entering or exiting one of the other apartments, no drunken hollering to “öffne die Tür!” or even a simple “Hilf mir, bitte!” Nobody had left the building to our knowledge, much less in droves. But Kieran and I *did* have a tendency to get wrapped up in our own fear, and we could have missed key details like that while focusing on the wrong things. If the walls were as thick as we believed they were, it would’ve been an easy oversight. Drunk, apologetic people did exist…and I drifted off into a stupor. 

The next morning, I overslept slightly, but Kieran was up early and had made us coffee with a French press. As we sipped our coffee and ate the cherry-flavoured ayran yoghurt we’d bought from the supermarket next door, the melodrama seemed unnecessary in retrospect. The apartment was bright and cheery in the clear daylight, and we were able to laugh at ourselves and how dramatic my husband had probably thought we were being. 

As Kieran and I were leaving the complex to meet our old friend, I verified that the screen we saw from our balcony was a touchscreen keypad. That made us feel even better, and we were in excellent spirits, although we avoided looking at the Venetian masks. 

Before we walked to the U-Bahn, there was just one last thing that I needed to check. You will recall, as I mentioned, that visitors can ring the doorbell from outside the apartment complex, and I wondered which name our apartment was listed under. 

My eyes darted up and down the names of the apartment complex’s many inhabitants. I read them out in my head, seeing the familiar ones. Schuppert and Wolkenstein, ja. Ferreira. Neumann and Kowalski. 

But when I finally got to our floor, no names were listed. The white rows were completely blank, as if nobody lived there at all.
