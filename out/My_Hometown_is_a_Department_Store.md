45 of them. Spread across the U.S. They’re differentiated by the US Post Office abbreviation just like any other repetitive city name in the country. Cornucopia Wyoming, Cornucopia, Nebraska, Cornucopia Missouri. They had to choose areas that had a lot of empty land and were mainly flat. It would be an inconvenience to shoppers if they had to shove their carts up a hill like a consumerist Sisyphus. 

Each store is roughly the same size with some minor interior differences between locations. The permanent population is equal to that of a small to medium sized town. They’re really not too different from the old company towns. One in which the residents of the town work for a company and the company operates all facets of life in the town. 

You often hear about how sometimes the building of a big box store brings new life and excitement to a small town. Well at Cornucopia, it is the town. New highway extensions were built, new exits created just so delivery trucks and shoppers could make the quest to the great city store. 

I grew up there. I was one of the many children of the employees of Cornucopia. I’m from Cornucopia, Colorado. Was born in the hospital and raised there. My dad got enough promotions that he was able to afford a home the single family section. It was the true American dream. It’s a nice white two story house with a sculpted tree with a tire swing dangling from it. And a 25x30 foot patch of Rolling Hills brand turf. Rolling Hills of course being Cornucopia’s generic landscaping brand. 

Most of the workers can't afford to travel very far, and since they have all the utilities of a town and supplies, most families don’t need to leave for months at a time. As a result, Cornucopia’s light system is made up of a series of mild sun lamps to replicate the outdoors. The store is open 24 hours but has day and night cycles, switching between the overhead sun lamps and more localized product and pathway lights, similar to street lights. There’s a curfew for the children of the workers, with directions not to let them out after 9pm when the final of the overhead lights are dimmed, especially for the furniture section. 

There’s a brand for every facet of life here. Bountiful Harvest for food, Palace Wares for home goods and furniture, etc. Like any store, the products sold are a
mix of generic brands and name brands. The strange part is that some of these name brands are companies I haven’t seen anywhere else. And the deeper you go in parts of the store, the more bizarre the products. Sometimes in the dark corners you can see pieces of lawn furniture moving around on their own. And that isn’t even getting into the curious selection of meats and vegetables in the grocery section. I heard some of the game is hunted on an on-site hunting range but all of us kids were forbidden to go there. 

It also isn’t really that clear who operates the Cornucopias. They have a Nasdaq sure but searching for higher ups just brings you back to company websites. Aside from the PR people and regional managers that sold everyone their homes, everything else is pretty secretive. 

I know I said employees/residents didn’t have much need to leave the store, but it was a bit more than that. In fact it was encouraged. 
“As a valued Cornucopia employee, you can find everything you need to live your life to the fullest, right here within our doors.”

They even have visiting rooms where you could have long distance conversations with any family if they couldn’t visit themselves. And really, when would they even have time to travel. Because of the close living quarters, people could be called in at any time and simply pick up the shift anywhere they happened to be. 
Our only experience with the outside world for a lot of us kids was watching movies on Cornucopia Grand, the official streaming service of Cornucopia industries. 

As kids we all went to school, just like anyone else, but along with all the regular classes, we had what were essentially workplace training programs for Cornucopia. These started with basic manners lessons on how to greet and interact with customers when we were and as we aged the classes diversified to kids who may want to pursue different positions within the store. The high school also reserved a few rooms for higher learning for those who wanted to pursue careers in teaching, doctors or business degrees to be utilized within the store and company.

Then of course there’s the Backwalk. The Backwalk is a sort of coming of age ritual that developed among the people of the Cornucopia stores. Essentially, when a child reaches 18, they must traverse the back storage area of the store. This quest can take up to a month to complete.  

The back areas are a poorly lit and desolate place. Hallways upon hallways rise up like the walls of a vast cavern. And you must move quickly, especially if you hear footsteps behind you. You must pack appropriately for the quest. This includes parkas for the freezers as well as flashlights, flares, hunting knife, food, water and clothes, preferably water proof boots. Climbing ropes are also necessary for some areas.

While going questing into the backrooms is a rather antiquated facet of the company, as it is mostly done by machines now, it is regarded almost religiously by the residents. Each Backwalk ceremony differentiates between locations but the send off of the wayward youth is highly ceremonial. A great feast is held at which point the reverend of the store church christens the child as a man or woman. Then they are adorned with a ceremonial crown and stand up atop the grandstand in the produce aisle. The crown is made of wicker, and shaped like the titular cornucopia the store is named after, giving the recipient a distinctly witchy look. 

After the celebration, the young individual is presented with all the gear they will need during their Backwalk. I know all this because my 18th birthday was a week ago. 

My Backwalk ceremony is scheduled in three days. I don’t want to do it. I’m tired of this place. It’s tough, this store is all I’ve ever known. But I’ve wanted to see more. I’ve wanted to see real sun and sky, take a hike in a real forest, not just the fake wilderness built to promote Cornucopia's great outdoors area with robotic fish that “bite just like the real thing!” There’s a big mechanical lumberjack in that area. His laugh used to scare me. Sometimes I’ll catch him looking to long at me…

Anyway, my parents really want me to follow their footsteps. Tale as old as time I know. But it’s different. It’s not just your family that wants you to pursue the same career. It’s everybody. Everybody expects you to contribute something to the store. There are people who leave, people who choose to leave the store behind. But those people can never go home again, not really. The company has ways of isolating people who leave the store life from their families. Although most of the time, the communities do that on their own just fine. Every facet of life is the store. The sermons praise Cornucopia's bountiful generosity and employment.  One should be thankful of what they have according to them. 

On the one hand I want to leave this place, get out of this damn store, but I can’t just leave my family. That’s why I’m posting this here. Before I make my way to the Grand Stage, or pack my bags and flee this place, let me know what I should do. But let it be known, Cornucopia never forgets.
