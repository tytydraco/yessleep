My name is Mike, and i LOVE sonic the hedgehog. especially the classics, one of my friends, Luis, sent me an email. The email said, "Hey!1!! I have a game for you, i know you love sonic!!!! so i found this for you!!!" Along with the email was a game titled "SONIC: SPRINGS. EXE" i booted it up and it looked like the first sonic game, i was happy because as i said, i loved the classics!

It started with sonic running through a black void revealing the SEGA Logo. then the sonic jumped into the classic logo, doing his finger wagging. I pressed play and started "Spring lake ACT 1"

Near the end of the act there was a boss fight with doctor Robotnik, but the game glitched, bad. every thing turned red... Then the music glitched really bad.

Then the game crashed, I was visibly confused. so i booted the game up again and every thing started the same. except  when i pressed play, text appeared saying, "Yo**U**r I**n** **M**y W**o**RlD **mI**kE" alongside with the text was a angry sonic. then i realized. there was a text file i had not seen be fore on my computer, it was titled, "Go**D"**  I opened it and it said, "PLEASE HELP 01001000 01000101 00100000 01001001 01010011 00100000 01000111 01001111 01000100 00101100 00100000 01001000 01000101 00100000 01001001 01010011 00100000 01001111 01010101 01010010 00100000 01010011 01000001 01001001 01010110 01001111 01010101 01010010PLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEAS..............................................\\,L;CKJCHD " I was speechless.

I watched as the game took over my computer. im using a new computer to write this. i went to school and didnt see Luis..... so i went to his house, still, gone.
