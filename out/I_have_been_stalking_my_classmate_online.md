"Good morning class! I would like you all to welcome Mary Spencer!" 


 I looked up from doodling in my sketchbook. Mary looked like your typical 16 year old girl. Pretty, good looking.  She'll be popular in no time. 


 I just sighed and went back to my drawings. I'm a artist. I'm not what you would say bad looking but I'm not that popular either. If she was another dude maybe I could've made a friend you know? 


 Mrs. Kay tells Mary about finding her a desk. To my surprise she picked the one behind me while everyone else whispers to themselves. 


 I quickly put my sketchbook into my backpack as to not let her see how lame I was. 


 As she Sat down she past me a smile and I just nodded right back. 


 The class went on with her talking about how Christopher Columbus wasn't the inly one to settle on America blah blah blah. When the bell rang I went to my locker. As I was changing books amd shut it I jumped cause she was literally close to me. 


 "Um… can I see what you drew?" She asks shyly. 


 I was appalled. I thought that she didn't see me put the notebook into my bag but I guess I wasn't as discrete as i thought I was. I handed it to her and she pans through the pages. Other kids in the hallway just kept giving us weird looks as they were walking. 


 "Oh my god these are actually pretty good!" 


 My heart lifted. The fact that someone likes my drawings always gives me comfort to keep doing. I've grown a little bit of a following on Twitter doing commissions for people that like it as well. 


 "You think you can draw me something?" 


 I just realized that I haven't even said a word to her. "Um, yeah sure. What would you like me to draw for you?" 


 In a quick motion she pointed her fingers at her. "You can do self portraits right?" 


 Self portraits are the easiest kind of things that I can do. "Yeah. It will probably take me a while though". She nods her head excitedly. Then she reaches her hand flat out to me.


 "I'm going to need to see your socials that way I can keep in touch with you." 


 Let me tell you I almost dropped to the floor at that moment. My hand shaking nervously I give her my phone. She then starts to add all her information on it. As she gives my phone back she says," I also gave you my number that way I can check on it ok?" 


 That made my heart sink a little as now I know she doesn't see me as a interest. 


 When I got home and put my stuff up I went into my bedroom and set at my work desk and pulled out my sketchbook. Since all of the kids in my school get their school work done during the day we rarely have homework. I hear a notification from my phone.


 Hey. Just want to know if you can have it done by Friday? 


 I think about her face and hair style and think that maybe if I focused on nothing else I can do it in a week. 


 Ok. 


 :)


 I started to work. I went through all her socials and picked the pictures that I thought was the best. I went and started working. After a while I realized I could be done by that night. So after dinner I just kept drawing and drawing. 


 Next morning when she came to my locker she was suprised when I showed it to her. "Oh my god you finished it in one night!" She yells after holding up her self portrait. 


 "Yeah. I guess you were nust easy to draw."


 She then frowned at my comment. 


 I realized what I had just said. "No. No, what I'm saying is that your face has a nice posture?" I crossed my fingers behind my back hoping that she still wouldn't yell at me. 


 Her face then calmed down. "Ok!" She said in a smile and went. 


 Later that night I got another message from her. This is what it said:


 Hey again! One of my family members really liked your drawing! They took it and shared it on Facebook. Now a few of my other family members want the same picture! Can you do that? 


 I sighed. Didn't really know how to answer her on that. I mean. When people do stuff like this they get paid. I just thought of this as a way of her family members seeing how happy she is here. So I replied back. 


 Hey. Yeah I'm down to do a few. How many pictures are you talking? 


 It took a few moments until she sent me another message. 


 Yeah sure! It'll only be 5. I promise that after that I will be done! 


 That meant that after I do these she won't talk to me again. 


 Ok. It will be a very long time before you get them. 


 She replies.


 Ok. :) 


 I then spent many of my free time drawing her. At first I kind of thought of this as being creepy. But then thought again that she was the one that asked for them. I tried to get a different look for each drawing. Make them more unique.


 So i really studied her Instagram, Snapchat and Tiktok for the following month.  


 I only noticed the changes after a couple of months. If any one else did this that wasn't an artist probably wouldn't notice at first either. In the third drawing her cheekbones were a little higher than usual. Then the color of her irisis started changing hues. 


 I just couldn't comprehend it at first. My first logical conclusion is that it was because I was drawing her all of the time. Yeah, that must be it. 


 So after a couple of days break from drawing I went to the next one. This time I was going to use the newer pictures that she post everyday. As I was drawing I got a sick feeling in my stomach. Something was telling me not to continue. 


 But I did. Let me tell you it was getting stranger by the minute. Was her face a bit higher this time? It was. Everyday that i drew her more of the slight changes became bigger. 


 I'm confused. How is this possible?


 Whenever I finally got done with them drawings I gave them to her. She was so excited that she hugged me. What scared me though was what she whispered in my ear. 


 "You are a perfect artist. Maybe you should draw me everyday." 


 She then let go of me and skipped down the hallway. I was shivering with fear. The coldness in her voice when she said that. 


 After that instead of drawing more I spent days studying her pictures. I was right and wasn't going crazy. Every picture she took a slight change was wrong with her face. 


 This creeped me out even more. I finally decided that she wasn't human. I looked online and concluded that she must be skinwalker. The reason I'm typing all of this now on here is because I recieved a message from her. 


 Hey. You wanna come over to my house? My family would love to meet you.
