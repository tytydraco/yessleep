I am writing this down while I still have some vestige of sanity left.  I’m in some remote and really nice hospital, and while the facility itself is immaculate I do feel a bit like a lab rat being fussed over by doctors and nurses.

It’s a lot cozier now that I’m deemed non contagious and all of the hazmat suits and weird air filters have been removed.  I’m allowed to roam the ward- I suppose you could call it a ward- but not allowed to leave.  Not that I want to.  I don’t think I’d make it home, or anywhere else for that matter.

Allow me to backtrack a bit.

I’m a chronic and avid reader of NoSleep.  I sort by new.  If you have ever posted here I have probably read it.  

A few days ago, I was listlessly doomscrolling and flipping between tiktok and reddit when I came across what seemed to be a glitch.  A new story had just posted, but with no title and no username- just an empty line and an option to upvote or downvote.  Curiosity got the better of me.

It opened a single post that only said “CURE.MP3”.  The auto moderator comment was distorted all to hell, with all sorts of corrupt artifacts and large chunks of redundant letters.  I dismissed it as a bugged upload, and when I refreshed the feed; it was gone.  

Sounds harmless, right?

Then I got the text.

It was from a blank phone number.  It merely read “You shouldn’t have done that.”  

I’ll admit, at this point I was annoyed moreso than frightened.  I figured someone had managed to hack my phone by me having accessed the false story, and I was mentally preparing for having to lock down all of my accounts and possibly get a new phone.  

Then a voice memo came through.  It had no timestamp.  

I clicked play.

It was loud- jarringly so.  I flinched back in my seat and dropped my phone onto my desk.  It was a series of loud bursts of… static?  Or something like that.  It was like white noise but far more aggressive.  It was also interspersed with morse code like beeps of varying frequencies, and random dial tones.  

The noise stopped, and a very distorted automated voice spoke.  “Thank you for opting into the cure.  This action is no longer reversible.  We will monitor your progress with enthusiasm.”

The noise returned, louder.  I had a splitting headache now, and there were now… knocks, added to the mix.  I went to stop the audio, but then the knocking came from my own wall.  I froze, looking up in actual horror as the knocks spread throughout the room- like something was tapping its way through the walls, hunting for an opening.  

It got weirder.  In the chaos, I glanced back down at my phone- louder still- and saw I was receiving more text messages from the blank number.  My IP address.  My social security number.  My blood type and organ donar status.  My allergies.  A list of my medications.  My exact coordinates on google earth.  The time of day I had woken up and when I had gone to bed.  

Then came the photos.  Dozens.  All grainy, washed out images but all obviously of me- and they were taken… live.  They were of me in the room I was sitting in, staring in transfixed singular terror at my phone.  Someone was in here with me at some impossible angle.

I spun around, looking for the culprit, but only found an empty room with oddly swelling shadows and the constant knocking.  God, it was so loud.  The headache felt like a railroad spike being driven through my temporal lobes, with the occasional electric zap they made my muscles tense up.

Then it stopped.  All of it.  Silence.  My ears were still ringing, and I glanced over at my phone to see an “overheated” warning.  Sure enough, it was searing hot to the touch.  I carefully laid it on an air vent and laid down on the floor beside it, unsure how to process whatever the fuck had just happened.

When my phone rebooted, the messages were, naturally, gone.  That ruled out going to the police.  And what would I even tell them?  That an internet identity thief or stalker or some sort of digital demon had sent me annoying sounds and my personal info?  It all sounded insane.

It was unsettling, but it was the weekend and I decided to drink it off and ignore it unless it happened again.  

And it didn’t, and everything was fine- until I was down nearly a whole liter of vodka and, while very drunk, and tired, unable to fall asleep.  I tossed and turned and tried listening to rain sounds or sleep asmr; I downed a benadryl, I even tried holding my breath to see if I’d pass out (that failed).  I only succeeded in making myself more groggy, but I was still wide awake.

Once the alcohol began to wear off and I was approaching the sunrise without having slept for nearly 24 hours actual concern began to creep in.  I ate.  I drank water.  I took a melatonin.  

At the 36 hour mark I was at the emergency room.  The nurses mostly seemed annoyed or amused that I had gone to the emergency room for insomnia, and gave me the riot act of how they weren’t going to write me sleeping medicine.  I explained- as best as I could in my tired state of mind- I just wanted to know why I couldn’t sleep.  After some pleading, they agreed to perform some imaging tests.

Then they went from frustrated to horrified.  I couldn’t see the images as they rolled me back to my room, but I could see the looks of confusion and fear as they cast glances at each other and a look of pity on me.

The Doctor- I think she said her name was Dr. Amana- she gently told me that several areas of my brain had advanced lesions that were comparable to scar tissue from a recent operation.  She emphasized that they were present everywhere but the brain stem and that it was nothing short of a miracle I was able to be awake at all.  I joked that being awake was the problem.  She didn’t find it as funny as me.

She explained she had never seen anything like this before, and that I would be transferred.  She asked if I had any recent head injuries.  I told her no.  She went through a laundry list of questions about possible exposure to radiation, about family medical histories- all to get nowhere.  I finally brought up the weird sound frequency and texts.  She waved away the notion that they were related, but did add it to my chart for transfer.

Someone didn’t wave it away though.  After about half an hour men in hazmat suits arrived and took me to a helicopter.  They didn’t speak a word to me, and barely looked at me on the flight to what seemed to be a large, brutalist structure in the middle of a forest.

I was taken to the basement, and given my own sealed off series of three rooms- comfortable, mind you, it was almost more like a hotel than a hospital (save for the medical equipment and constant beeping).  I was hooked up to all kinds of electrodes to monitor all of my body activity.  Blood samples were taken.  So was a sample of spinal fluid.  Ever had a needle in your spine?  Not exactly pleasant.

By this point time and reality had become a sort of blur.  I certainly wasn’t asleep but I would space out and dissociate and then find myself standing somewhere else, or being tested on or prodded at.  I noticed my reflection in the mirror.  They had shaved my head and a new scar was present where that biopsied a small portion of damaged tissue.  

Men in suits came and asked a lot of questions about the sound I had heard.  About the knocking.  I don’t remember what I told them.  At this point I was hallucinating that they were suits made out of hospital equipment and that a goldfish was swimming through purple triangles.

The doctors talked about me more than to me.  The general consensus was that it was some prion adjacent disease, something similar to fatal familial insomnia without a genetic link, or maybe some odd form of degenerative disease.  

They didn’t know.  After several days of testing, they essentially gave up and have settled on making me comfortable.  The men in the suits took my phone but brought me a new one.  They’re still nearby though, but I don’t know if they are real or if I’m hallucinating them like I am the faces made out of legos.

No amount of medicine has managed to get me to sleep.  I can be “put under”, but I awaken feeling no amount of rest, and per a study while I was under, my brain remains in a highly active state.

They are being very nice to me, likely because they know the same thing that I do- that I don’t have long left.  Or, worse, that I do have a lot longer left.  Can one be dead and still awake?  I hope I don’t find out the answer to that.

I post this to warn you: if you see a glitched post on here without a title, or mentions of a “cure”, or get bizarre texts about such- do not listen to the noise.  Sometimes, no sleep is forever.  A long, tired, groggy forever.  

Goodnight, and sleep tight.  Hopefully you can.
