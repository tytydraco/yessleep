I’m thirty-two, and my love for beer has been a carefully crafted psyop since college. The American Beverage Forum worked hard to put into the late millennial mind that beer is a craft. You aren’t just boozing anymore, you're experiencing art. Drinking beer is an art. That’s why every beer label looks like something out of a Chelsea gallery. 

*Drowned in a Tub of Goldfishes. Hope is the Thing with Feathers. We Real Cool.* My favourite poems? No, the funky sours menu. Nothing I felt could be drowned by mere funk, or citrus IPA, or triple black stout. I wanted sludge. Maltose sweetness. Rice adjuncts and workhorse yeast.

“A Miller,” I said.

“We don’t have Miller.”

“A Michelob.”

“That’s not the type of beer we serve.”

“Can you get me something craft that’s an *imitation* of Miller or Michelob?”

“I think—I think we have that.”

He came back with an amber bottle capped in white. The label was shockingly rudimentary: a flat, off-white background, a clip-art dad flipping burgers in one of those puffy chef hats. The text was printed in Courier, perfectly uniform: Defiji Hujins. No slogan. No description. No origin.

“If that’s not what that tastes like. I’m gonna be very surprised,” said the bartender. He popped the cap with a turn of his hand. A twist-off—good sign.

I grabbed its waist, and I felt the label under my palm barely sticking to the side. Nursing the top, I tilted the bottle, and the first splash coated my mouth. A low airy noise popped as my lips pulled off, the beginning to a sigh of satisfaction. A single-note taste with a sparkling finish. This was the trash beer for my trash life.

“I wanna fucking kill myself.”

“I don’t listen to that kind of talk, here, man,” said the bartender. “Pick a real subject, and we can chat. Otherwise, I’ll kick you out.” 

“Kick me out? I’ve had like three sips of this thing,” I said. “Fine. Let’s talk women.”

“How long did you date?”

“Two years. Never had a single fight. Still haven’t. It was the most level-headed breakup I ever experienced.”

“That’s a good thing, man. You guys, you could be friends, you know?”

“Without yelling or throwing things, there’s no release,” I said. “I deserved a valid crashout.”

“So now you’re getting drunk so you can crashout in my bar,” said the bartender. “You gonna break stuff, man?”

“Can’t I just cry in public till a friend picks me up?”

“Sure, but you hide in the corner while you do it.” He pointed at the tiny table pressed against the wall under the staircase. “Don’t scare people off from my main bar.”

I stood and staggered from my seat. My legs weren’t wobbly like jello—they just refused to move in sync with the rest of me. Beer sloshed out the top of my bottle, splashing my wrist.

The perilous thirty-foot journey ended with me slamming onto a wooden seat and immediately hunching over my phone. Funny how you don’t even have to dig through your pictures to see an ex. Phones do it for you, dropping a surprise from a year ago onto your homescreen to poke at your nostalgia.

“*Em—ma—lee*…” The sobbing started without any tears. Convulsing lungs got worse with every fond memory that popped up. A picture of us chilling in a giant, two-person Christmas sweater with our pet cat Narwhal sitting in our lap. I swiped left to a picture of a hair in our takeout I never deleted. I swiped to a concerning rash on Narwhal’s behind. Meme. Meme. Meme. A QR code. A picture of Emmalee eating homemade ice cream I made for her. 

“Why-y-y—” The tears began rolling. I would soon become a mess if I didn’t periodically dab my eyes with my sleeve. At the time, I wasn’t sure I wanted attention, so I tried to keep my sniffling as quiet as possible. 

Swiping continued. Emmalee at the beach. Meme. Emmalee and I at a wedding. Screenshot of a groupchat. Meme. Emmalee belting Goldfinger’s “Superman” at karaoke. Then, something strange I didn’t recognise. These were from a year ago, so it made sense I didn’t recognise everything, but… I failed to recall any context here.

I cleared the tears from my eyes before checking again, but it was still a blurry mess. I slumped into the wooden chair, phone in hand, beer tacky on my lips. Tiny gray ovals filled the screen, like olives packed in brine, each puckered with budding warts.

They stared back at me from the screen. It was a photo at first. Then they twitched, just a flicker. Suddenly, it all came alive, like a drink fizzing, new ovals bubbling off the old ones.

I blinked. They began wriggling, climbing over each other like a living mass of tiny, malformed creatures. Each bump pulsed, and I could feel it in my head. Then my phone made a smell. I thought it might be my own breath bouncing off the screen—warm, bitter, and yeasty.

I leaned closer. The tiny gray ovals weren’t contained anymore. They crawled out of the glass, over my fingers, pressing soft, wet weight into my skin. Inching like slugs onto my fingertips, ducking into the blood-stained corners where I habitually nibbled off hangnail flesh. They were inside me, multiplying in my vision, in my blood, in the spaces between my thoughts.

I jumped at the touch of a hand on my shoulder. My heart thumped so hard I could feel it in my chest.

I turned. And froze.

The man standing behind me had a face shaped like an oval, smooth and slightly swollen, with translucent, glistening skin that caught the dim light like wet wax. It reminded me of the tiny cells I’d just been staring at, but it wasn’t gray. Flesh, mushy and refracted, was tinted with sickly pinks and creams.

He was speaking, but the words were distant, muffled, like someone talking underwater on the far side of a swimming pool. I could feel the vibrations of the syllables, but I couldn’t make sense of them. Each pulse made his face seem to stretch, ripple, wobble like liquid glass.

I got out my seat and stumbled back, hands reaching out, the world swimming around me. The man’s gurgling grew louder like he was calling out to me with concern. His hand reached for my collar, I swatted it away, and tried to navigate what once was a basement bar in Bend, Oregon, now a densely packed labyrinth. 

More people with amoeba heads stood like sentinels every few steps. I dodged left and right, ducked under swinging arms, crawled between a pair of legs. Then gravity flipped. My memory broke into blips.

For a few seconds I floated up a long cement staircase. A blinding light snapped me back into my body and dropped me onto cold, misty streets. Pine trees lined the road, planted upside down, their roots writhing like tentacles toward a silvery blue sun barely visible through the fog.

And that smell. That smell was back. My phone was gone, though. I’d lost it somehow. Yet, the air hung thick with the warm, damp tang of malt and old grain.

Sounds emanated from shadows deep in the fog. More creatures were coming. These were not like the others. Their voices cut through everything.

“*Whiskey dick.*” A young woman’s voice. Familiar, though not to me. To Emmalee. Her friend. “*Beer dick. Rum dick.*” The words hissed, meant to sting.

I fled into the forest. The gnarled trees did not grab me. They parted, making space, careless enough to leave me exposed. The creatures followed. Their bodies curved like chalices, wide at the top, impossibly thin at the waist. They slipped ahead of me, blocked my path. Those behind slowed, letting the circle close all at once.

They staggered toward me, unable to move straight. Each face carried something I recognized, skin dyed beet red. Mandrill-like, but wrong. Piercing blue eyes stared out, artificial, the flat, too-bright blue of colored contacts.

I knew a friend of Emmalee’s who wore such radiant fashion. It was her times ten. “*Vodka dick. Cider dick*.” She put her hands on me and, instantly, I was full of rage. My hands shot back at her, immediately taking the two of us to the ground. I wrapped my grip around her throat, and all she did was laugh at me.

“He’s too awkward. He doesn’t like any of the stuff we like.” This was her. The oversexed friend who’s always putting ideas in Emmalee’s head. “You need a guy that will make you cum every single day, twice a day, not come home drunk with a flat tire…”

I hit her. I hit her so hard. My knuckles stung but were immediately soothed by her blood, unnaturally cool, chilled. It was like I was beating the snot out of somebody already dead. Her nose crumpled under my force, and some of the blood landed on my face. I licked my lips and was surprised it tasted so sweet. Like a berry, or grape soda.

More blackouts, little memory jumps. I was tiring out from beating on these creatures. We were losing light. The cerulean star above dimmed its light, taking its breath with me. I choked violently. 

The seizures sprang me awake back into the real world. A harsh stridor filled my chest, each gasp like metal scraping air. I had a cat’s tongue and a swollen uvula dangling in the back of my throat like a vinyl punching bag. 

I was slumped against the low retaining wall behind a shuttered café on Wall Street, the chill of Bend night crawling up my arms. The alley was narrow, littered with dry leaves and the occasional paper cup, and I could see the dim glow of distant streetlamps reflecting off the windows of the closed shops. 

I hadn’t woken up somewhere strange before. Even ten years ago, when I blacked out as a teenager, my body had done that autopilot bullshit, dragging me back to my bed. This time, I was exposed, alone, and fully awake in a place I didn’t recognize, unsure how I’d gotten here.

Red streaks on my hands caught the dim light. Panic shot through me. I pushed myself up, swaying unsteadily, letting instinct guide me down streets that seemed faintly familiar, sidewalks I might have stumbled past before, the curve of a lamppost that triggered a memory. My feet scraped the cracked pavement, and my coat hung open, flapping with every misstep. I had no idea how long I wandered like that, each step a mix of confusion and instinct, until the outline of my apartment building finally emerged, a beacon of familiarity.

By the time I fumbled with keys and slipped inside, the panic had fully set in, but the usual headache was, oddly enough, not there. I was dizzy, sure, but a hangover for me has pain, lots of pain, the kind where I crunch Tylenol with my teeth so they act faster, then throw my head back on the pillow to numb the throbbing with more sleep. None of that was happening.

I flicked on the bathroom light. My blue button-down was splotched, streaked, ruined. Blood? My blood? I ripped the shirt off in a blind, frantic motion. As it passed my face, a sharp, sweet scent brushed my nose. Confused, I balled the shirt up in my hands and inhaled deeply. 

Wine. Somehow, I’d spilled wine all over myself.

I drop the balled-up shirt in the sink. The hot water hisses as I twist the knob of my shower, letting it run over me, trying to wash the wine off. The scent clings to my hands even under a sheen of soap, stubborn and obnoxious.

I didn’t write any of this down after that first night. I told myself it was a fluke. A bad mix of grief and booze. Something I’d misremembered because I wanted to.

I only started thinking about documenting it later—after it happened again. After I woke up somewhere stranger.
