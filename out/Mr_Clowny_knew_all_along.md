Come honey, it’s time to eat.

Her cooking isn't like it used to be. I think she lost her touch.

“Coming”

Omar sits on the dining table.

“So how is it?”

“Great as usual.“

Yeah she definitely lost her touch. This chicken is bland.

“I accidentally burned myself while cooking. Your clumsy mom at it again”.

“You need to be careful.”

“Anyway. What do you have planned for today?”

“Razi is coming over”

He’s my best friend, been so for years.

“Thats great.”

Mom then sat in her chair in the living room.

While waiting for Razi, Omar got jumped by Clowny

“Kuh-kuh-kuh kill yourself Omar. Fucking kill yourself. Duh-duh-duh-do it now”

Clowny is the weird slender man with a jukebox for an abdomen, he’s not real but likes to pop up and remind me of what's important.

“How many times do I have to tell you. I’d never kill myself, I wouldnt do that to mom, Shes the only reason i am alive.”

“Kuh-kuh-kuh Kill her then yourself, do it-it-it-it do it now”

He gets easier to filter out once you're used to him.

Omar dials Razi. 

It barely rings and he answers. 

“Im coming in right now”

Razi enters through the front door.

“Hey bud” *chuckles* 

We walk and talk through the living room and into my room. Mom gives me the weirdest stare as we pass by her.

“I really appreciate you always being there for me Razi. You truly are a friend.”

“Of course dear”

Amidst their conversation; Omar’s old chemistry teacher Zaid appeared behind Razi.

Zaid began giving a chemistry lesson and scribbling on the wall like its a white board.

He had me fooled when i met him outside yesterday. But now i know he isnt real.

Mom knocked, then came in my room.

“Hi Ms. Maryam” said Razi

Mom doesn't react.

She grabs Omar's hand and pulls him aside.

“Ow” 

Omar is suprised from a burn mark on his hand.

“What are you doing?”

Omar sits in her chair, it's cold fabric prompted him to cover himself with a blanket

“Talking to Razi”

“Honey…....

There's no one there.”

“Have you been taking your meds?”

Shock hits Omar like an avalanche.

“How isn’t he there? I always check if hes real. Razi is my childhood friend.”

Omar looks behind him and Razi was gone.

“I’ll just call him. You’ll see”

Omar video calls Razi. 

After 9 rings, the call is answered.

“Hey Omar, Long time no see”

Razi looks… different. Older, and has a beard.

“Razi thank god. I thought you weren't real. Mom said you werent.”

“Omar…

have you been taking your meds?”

Don’t

“Did you forget again?”

“Kuh-kuh-kuh Kill yourself Omar do it now-” Clowny screamed

“I *am* real Omar”

Don’t say it…

“Maryam Passed years ago”

................

“That's.......... right. Mama passed away”

“Kuh-kuh-kuh Kill yourself, you have not-ot-ot-thing to live for now HAHAHAHAHAHA. Duh-duh-duh-duh do it now!!!”

"Goodbye Razi. I guess I've been imagining you here with me too. My two special people..."

Omar hangs up the call.

It’s been a long time Mama. Maybe its time to finally join you.
