Hello, internet!

So earlier today I went on a camping trip to a public cabin with my girlfriend. As soon as we got there we would always go to the back and look in the storage box that is attached to the cabin. We would almost always found some cool things to play with. Last time we were here we found an axe. We always put these things back, of course. This time when we went to check there was a small hole in the box. I looked into the hole to see there was something inside. It was a small black bear. It looked like it was trying to get some food that was left in there and whoever was here before us closed the hatch on it and shot it through the box. I'm guessing that's how the bullet hole got there.

When we opened the storage box we saw that the bear was still alive, but its paw was bleeding. Black bears are very curious and wasn't scared of us at all. We tried our best to get him out of the box and he limped over to the picnic table that was to the left of the cabin.  We brought a first aid kit with us and patched up his paw.

We both thought that would be the end of the bear but he actually stuck around. He kept going back into the box. Maybe he was just looking for more food, or maybe he just really likes staying in the box. Now, me and my girlfriend always have this rule that we don't use our phones while out camping, so we put all our gear and phones into the left side of the box while still leaving some room on the right for if the bear wants to go back in.

With the gear put away we took the food inside so that our bear friend couldn't get to it. It was almost about time for me to make dinner when my girlfriend said she was gonna go to the bathroom. Even though there is an animal outside that doesn't mean we are. There is an outhouse about 100 feet from here that intersects with the rest of the cabins in the area. But I think it was just an excuse for her to go see the bear again.

Well I started to make dinner and it was taking me a lot longer than I thought. It had be over an hour and she still hasn't come back. That's when I heard a loud scream from outside. It sounded like two bears fighting so I thought our bear killed, like, a wolf or something. I went out and saw the bear dead on the ground covered in blood. I don't know why but my first thought was the people that stayed here before came back to finish the job. I was getting really freaked out looking at it so I went to go to the outhouse to look for my girlfriend. I started going up the trail but I didn't make it very far before I heard rustling in the forest and saw a huge grizzly bear. It was about the size of a small car and never seen anything like it in real life. I tried to be quiet and just keep walking but it must have heard me. It started to charge at me and I ran as fast as I could back to the cabin. My heart was beating faster than it ever had before. Once I ran back, I went as fast as I could and jump inside of the storage box to hide and shut the hatch.

And I guess that's where the story catches up to me. The grizzy stayed there for so long that I got bored and grabbed my phone that I left in here. That's when I started writing out this post. I've been writing this post for about an hour and I keep looking out of the bullet hole and see the grizzly pacing back and forth. I thought it would leave by now but I guess I'll keep waiting.


I really hope she gets back soon. This box is so cramped, and it's starting to get dark out.
