I'm writing this in absolute terror and urgency. I need your help. Two days ago, my friend came to my place, his eyes were wide with fear and excitement. He'd found something in the forest just next to his house. It was a camcorder, just lying there on the ground. He was hell bent on seeing the footage that could be on it. I had this gnawing feeling it could be linked to a crime or something like that, but his persistence was too much, and it was not like we had anything better to do.  
  
We connected the camcorder to my TV, we didn't know what to expect, I was hoping it would be nothing. And at first, it seemed to be just that. a regular video of some guy walking his dog in the forest. But then they approached this fallen log.  
  
The man hopped over it, then he beckoned his dog to follow. The dog just sat there, it turned its head looking confused. That's when we saw it. The dog's body contorted in ways that defied nature, morphing into a humanoid shape, standing grotesquely on its hind legs. Its head snapped upwards, front limbs twisted like human arms. It then jumped over the log, just like a person would.  
  
The silence from the man holding the camcorder was deafening, broken only by his heavy, panicked breaths. I wish he had turned the camera away, but he didn't. He kept filming this thing. We both sat there, transfixed in terror, staring at the screen. I was so overwhelmed I couldn't muster up anything to say, I couldn't move, couldn't even blink. My body was paralyzed. Then, we heard the most horrific screech, I don't know if it was the man or the dog.  
  
My friend was beside himself, oscillating between denial and pure terror. He tried to rationalize it, to convince himself, and me, that it was some sick prank or that all of this was a dream. We were both shaking, trying to process if any of it was real. We decided to take the camcorder to the police first thing in the morning. My friend was too scared to go back home so he crashed at my place.  
  
But when morning came, my friend was gone. He just vanished. The camcorder is still here. I've called him countless times, texted him, but there's been no response. I'm freaking out. I don't know what to do. I'm terrified that whatever was on that tape is more than just a video. What if it's out there? And now with him missing, I'm scared to even step out of my house.  
  
I don't know if going to the police is the right move. What if they don't believe me? What if they think we tampered with evidence? But I can't just sit here doing nothing while my friend could be in danger. I need advice, any kind of help or insight you guys can offer. Have you ever heard of anything like this? What should I do? Please, I'm begging you. I just want to find my friend and make sure he's safe.
