I wake up before the sound.

That’s how I know it isn’t normal.

My eyes open at exactly 2:17 a.m., every night, without an alarm, without a dream pulling me out. It feels less like waking and more like being *summoned*. As if something elsewhere has finished preparing, and my body is simply responding.

I don’t move.

The dark in my bedroom is thick, uneven. I can’t tell where the walls end. The house is holding very still. Even the silence feels deliberate, like it’s listening for something to go wrong.

Then the sound begins.

A soft drag.

Not footsteps. Not scraping. Something heavier. Something being pulled along the floor without lifting itself, like it’s forgotten how legs work—or never had them.

It comes from the hallway.

I don’t turn my head. I don’t breathe too loudly. I learned early that movement makes the sound last longer. Stillness shortens it. Stillness is rewarded.

The drag stops just outside my door.

It always stops there.

For a moment, there is nothing.

Then comes the breathing.

It’s faint, but it’s wrong in a way I can’t explain. Each inhale hesitates, as if the thing breathing has to remember how. Each exhale trembles, wet and thin, like air being pushed through something that shouldn’t still be alive.

I clamp my eyes shut.

I count to sixty.

When I reach sixty, the sound ends, as though someone has flipped a switch. The house exhales. The night resumes. I am allowed to sleep.

That is how it has been for forty-two nights.

I tried to tell myself it was stress. Old houses settle. My job revolves around sound; my brain invents patterns. That’s what I told myself while avoiding the hallway after dark, while sleeping with the light on, while waking every morning with the taste of metal in my mouth.

On the forty-third night, I record it.

I set my equipment in the hallway before bed, careful not to look too closely at the floor. The carpet has begun to lie differently there—pressed flat in a long, narrow line, like something has been passing over it again and again.

At 2:17, I wake.

The sound begins.

I lie still, heart banging so hard I’m sure the microphone will pick it up. The drag lasts longer tonight. It pauses. Adjusts. Continues.

In the morning, I listen.

At first, there’s only static.

Then the drag.

Then—under it—breathing.

But there’s something else.

A voice.

It’s so quiet I think I imagined it, until I rewind and hear it again. The words are slurred, unfinished, like a mouth still learning how to shape them.

*“…not yet.”*

I don’t sleep the next night.

I sit upright in bed, light on, staring at the open doorway. The hallway looks narrower than it used to. The walls seem closer together, the ceiling lower. The house feels… attentive.

At 2:17, the sound starts anyway.

I watch the carpet.

It sinks.

Right in the middle of the hallway, the fibers press down, as if an invisible weight has been placed there. The depression moves slowly toward my room, leaving a flattened trail behind it.

I can smell it now.

Dampness. Rot. The sterile sweetness of something sealed away too long.

The depression stops at my door.

The breathing is right there.

So close I feel it change the temperature of the air.

I slam the door and lock it, my hands shaking so badly the key rattles. The sound stops instantly, like a scolded animal.

In the morning, the groove in the carpet is deeper.

That’s the day the doors stop opening.

All of them.

The windows won’t budge either. The glass is fogged from the inside, smeared as if something has been pressing its face against it. My phone shows full signal, but nothing connects. Messages don’t send. Calls don’t ring.

The house has decided something.

That night, the sound comes early.

1:43 a.m.

The drag is faster now. Sloppier. Impatient.

The breathing is louder. There’s a rhythm to it now—anticipation, not struggle.

I back away from the door, whispering to myself, *please don’t, please don’t*, as if the house might mistake me for someone it still needs.

Then I hear tapping.

Three soft knocks.

Not on the door.

On the wall beside my bed.

Tap.  
Tap.  
Tap.

The whisper comes again, clearer than before, right against the plaster.

“You’re lighter than the last one.”

The tapping moves upward, tracing the outline of where my head rests at night. The wall flexes. It doesn’t crack. It *gives*, like skin pressed too hard.

The house groans—not in pain, but in cooperation. Floorboards shift. Beams adjust. The room tightens around me.

At 2:17 exactly, the wall bulges inward.

Something presses through.

There are no features. No face. Just darkness folded into a shape that shouldn’t exist in three dimensions. The breathing fills the room, hot and wet, right against my ear.

I scream.

It pauses.

Then it whispers, softly, almost curious—

“Oh. You can still do that.”

The house goes quiet.

I don’t remember the rest.

They say the house was empty when they finally forced the doors open weeks later. No sign of me. No blood. No struggle.

Just a long groove in the hallway carpet.

And in the bedroom wall, three shallow dents—tapping gently, every night at 2:17—waiting for the house to wake someone else.
