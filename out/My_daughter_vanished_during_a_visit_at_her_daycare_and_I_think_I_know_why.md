I'm not writing this for pity, or attention or any of that, if anyone thinks that, then that's your loss, but before I get into what happened with me and my daughter, I guess I should explain my background, I'm a single father of a proud daughter, my wife died in a horrific car accident a few years ago, it impacted me very much, and this incident... This hurt me to the point where I want fucking revenge, let me explain everything...



So my daughter was 5 at the time, a curious naive happy child who would rarely get into trouble, I took her to this daycare named 'Jay's Nest.' the kids at the daycare were nice to her, but I was suspicious on the teacher, I don't even know if I could call it a teacher, it was a long limbed dark skinned woman that can extend her legs and arms without any pain, the kids loved it, but not me, so I'd always be there, supervising her just in case this teacher did anything, I know I might sound crazy for that, but you'll understand soon enough.



Suddenly one day while me and her were at the daycare, I noticed the teacher, named Jay, was only focused on my daughter, not the other children, yes she should check up on the other children if they got hurt or started a fight, but she was weirdly close to my daughter at all times, which made me even more suspicious, as I thought this longed limbed woman wanted something from my daughter that was no good, and I did learn that the hard way... Everytime daycare ended I felt relieved, heck, I wanted my daughter safe from that teacher, I had a bad feeling about her.



A few weeks in and summer break was coming up, and one day when the teacher was going out for lunch, my daughter approached me with a scared look, I obviously and immediately caught on to this and got worried, I crouched down to her level and asked. "What's the matter sweetie." I could notice her bright tan skin going pure pale, the once happy and joyful smile faded to scared and quivering lips, her eyes once had emotion of joy and happiness, turned into fear and paranoia. "I-I wanna go home..." I asked her why, I was 100% gonna take her home, no doubt about that, then what happened next proved my point, she showed a drawing presumably made by the teacher, and I swear, it felt like a dream after what contents were on the drawing, it was the teacher, giving my daughter to this weird metal creature with really sharp claws, the metal creature was labeled 'The Silencer, my god' and my daughter... Oh god... My daughter was labeled 'His dinner for today' My face turned white and my pupils trembled in fear.



"Sweetie... When did she give this to you?..." I asked her with full concern in my voice, she spoke in a still terrified voice. "T-Today..." After she said that, the power went out, I held my daughter close in protection, she yelped and I had to cover her mouth, not roughly, but enough for her to breathe, we quietly moved to the exit door, but not before... Not before hearing the screams and bloody pops of the kids that once inhabited the room, I tried opening the door but it wouldn't budge, I tried everything, kicking, slamming, heck, I even tried throwing a desk at the door, that didn't even break a window, I also noticed blood on the desk, which wanted me to get my daughter and myself out of this hell immediately, but what happened next tore my world in half, as the door finally busted open after 1 last kick, I could hear manic laughing and the squeals of my daughter, I turned around and Jay was holding my daughter by the neck. "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU, LET GO OF MY DAUGHTER!" I screamed at the creature, she only laughed and replied in an insane tone. "You don't understand, do you human, I have to serve my god, The Silencer, he will save us from the hell you call Earth, and as for your daughter... AHAHAHAHA, she's gonna be a perfect dinner for him, oh, and by the way, the names Bloody Jay." Then she quickly scattered away in the darkness, holding my daughter with her, I tried to chase after the creature, but I got kicked by an unknown force and blacked out in the street



After that day,  I felt so drained and heartbroken, losing my wife was 1 thing, but my daughter, the only other family I had, now gone, eaten by this 'Silencer' guy, I don't know what to do next, I feel like Jay- or... Bloody Jay, will come after me too, and feed ME to this Silencer being, once I get my hands on the creature, I'll kill her, I'll rip her to shreds-



There's someone at the door, thank you for letting me tell my tale, and please... For the love of god, keep your loved ones close...
