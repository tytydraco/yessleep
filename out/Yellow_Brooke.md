# When I was younger, I partied a lot. College was a joke; I cheated my way to get ahead. I didn't even wanna be in school. I went so my parents wouldn't think I was a disappointment. My life was vomiting Everclear into Gage's toilet while he held my hair back, laughing through my hurling, 'Only pussies puke.' Three of us took turns snorting coke off Delta Phi Kappa tits. On occasion, spit-roasting a drunk Sigma Theta Rho pledge with Lewis in the back of his minivan while Gage jerked off upfront. I'd chase anything to feel alive, anything to quell the numbness. One day, something chased back. 

# Lewis, Gage, and I drove around looking for something to do. Sitting in the back of Lewis's minivan, I ignored Nookie blaring from the speakers with my hands clamped against my ears. I just wanted to forget asshole professors and the obnoxious amount of homework; didn’t they know we had lives? Gage snagged his red flannel sleeve as he passed me a joint from upfront. Mom'd cut funds, forcing me to work at McDonald's forever, if she knew I was partying, empirical proof I was a fuckup. A lump formed in my neck as my throat tightened. 

# I took a long drag. Fruity smoke flooded my mouth and singed my throat. I dissolved into the leather interior; my head slumped against the rest. I counted the number of cracks in the ceiling until a brown daddy longlegs skittered across and dropped on me. Cold pinpricks crept up my neck. I slapped my shoulder furiously like I was on fire.

# "It's a daddy longlegs, not a tarantula, pussy," Gage laughed. 

# Lewis stretched a tattooed hand out, a black widow inked across his knuckles, black wiry legs curled around his sausage fingers. "Pass me a Bud!"

# "Not while you're driving," Gage hesitated. "One more DUI and you'll wind up with a face full of cold shower tiles." 

# "'The last thing you need is another D.U.I.' What are you, my mommy?" Lewis barked. "Pass me a fuckin' beer!"

# Gage pushed a brew into Lewis's open hand. "I guess it doesn't matter when mommy & daddy are the best lawyers in the state."

# Lewis gulped down his beer, burped, and tossed the can out the window. "My 'Daddy' got you probation instead of jail time for possession plus intent to distribute, shithead. He saved your downy ass from having your stupid face shoved into a mattress for the next five to twenty years," Lewis adjusted his sunglasses in the rearview. "Besides, my parents' firm has a whole wing named after them. I could run over a preschooler until they looked like spaghetti and get a slap on the wrist."

# I took another drag. "When's the acid supposed to kick in?"

# Gage shrugged, cracking open a beer. "Soon. It's been an hour since you took it."

# I exhumed a gray cloud of smoke from my lungs. Wispy clouds of gray smoke stung my eyes. "Where are we going?" 

# "Nowhere, Roy," Lewis said. 

# "We can walk around Yellow Brooke for a bit. My sister, Brenna, and I smoke a bowl and hike there sometimes," Gage suggested. "I've gotta take a piss anyways."

#  Lewis snorted. "Some creep got busted in those woods last year for dragging women off trail."

#  "When I heard about that—I thought it was you,” I ashed out the window. 

# Lewis's tires screeched as he swerved down Burroughs' Drive. I bounced in the air and bashed my head against the roof. "Thanks, dickweed."

# Lewis sniggered. "Should've buckled up, buttercup.”

# The road rippled and undulated like ocean waves. Trees pulsated as hairy, obsidian wolf-sized spiders scuttled across oaks; they melted into the trees, becoming one with them. Gage spilled out of the Odyssey when we pulled into the parking lot and sprinted for the forest. 

# I stared at the woods; colors of surrounding trees, bushes, and flowers, amplified swirling in complex, undulating kaleidoscope patterns. Pine and citrus mingled in the air, spreading over my taste buds like thick, sticky globs of creamy peanut butter. A divine calm settled in me. If I were on fire, I'd be like one of those burning Buddhist monks.

# "Are you done yet, Gage? What are you doing, sucking off Bigfoot?" Lewis mocked.

# "It hasn't even been a minute, shithead," I flicked the roach at him. "Don't worry, he wouldn't chug yeti cock without you, sweet pea."

# Gage burst out of the woods, struggling to button his piss-soaked jeans. Sweat poured down his scruffy face. "Guys! There's a girl trapped!"

# "What's wrong? Couldn't stand more than thirty seconds away from your boyfriend, honey?" I laughed. 

# Gage mopped sweat off his mug with the torn hem of his Radiohead shirt. "No dipshit, I found a trapdoor by a tree. I heard someone from the other side crying for help."

# "Bullshit," Lewis scoffed.

# Gage stabbed a calloused finger at the trail. "Go check it."

# We trailed the path—birds chirped their song, lilies swayed in the breeze. We came across a rotted green door with two chains glinted around a silver padlock and a rusted handle covered in flecks of amethyst, moss, twigs, and dead flies. 

# Lewis rolled his eyes. "Are you sure you're hearing someone?"

# "Please help me," a frail, feminine voice pleaded.

# Gage grabbed the brass handle. "It's okay, we're going to help you."

# Lewis snatched Gage's arm. "Stop! This is a trap. Don't you think it's a little too convenient that suddenly we hear a woman screaming for help? Let the cops handle this; my dad's drinking buddies with the chief."

#  "A man put me here. I haven't eaten or drunk for days; he did things to me,” The woman cried. 

# "We can't leave her here," I said. 

# Lewis ripped Gage from the door. "I'm not putting my ass on the line for a stranger. I don't wanna walk into a trap just because you want to be a hero!”

# Gage jerked his arm free from Lewis's grasp. "What if she's dead by the time we get help? What if that were your mother, asshole!" His voice cracked as his hazel eyes swelled and his bottom lip trembled. 

# Lewis tore a clump of shaggy golden locks from his head, eyes darting around like a trapped rat. "They're better equipped to handle this situation—fuck this, let's get out of here!" 

# Gage pushed past Lewis and struggled with the door. "Brenna would break her foot off in my ass if I didn't help this girl.”

# I scanned the area, spotted a purple baseball-sized rock, and smashed the lock. "I don't want her blood on my hands."

# Gage flung the door open; a naked woman lay on the ground; she grimaced at the beams of sunlight striking her face. Gore and dirt caked her curly auburn hair, her sunken baby blue eyes submerged in an ocean of purpled, blackened flesh. Her delicate nose twisted in the opposite direction; blood solidified beneath her nostrils; yellow pus oozed from broken scabs on her swollen lips. Bruises and gashes covered her rangy arms, slender hips, and plum-sized breasts. 

# Gage jumped into the chasm and took off his flannel, draping it over her. "Can you walk, ma'am?"

# “No,” the woman wiped tears away. 

# Gage brushed dirt off her hair. "What's your name?"

# "Lola," she grasped Gage's hand and brought it to her cheek.

# Gage rested his hand on her brittle shoulder. "Okay, I'm Gage. We'll get you out." 

# "I owe you my life,” Lola's flesh pulsated and twitched as if roaches were inside.

#  My heart jackhammered, my muscles constricted, and a yellow tsunami tore through my guts as suffocating panic  consumed me. Lola seized his arm and tore it off; brown-red arches sprayed the dirt. He dropped to his knees. He stared at the once incapacitated Lola as she tore at the limb like a lion ripping at a gazelle's throat. Yellow liquid oozed from her mouth as she devoured, dissolving the limb. A horrible sound, like someone slurping noodles, flooded the cavern. 

# Eight black spindly legs exploded from Lola's back, thick and bristling. Her mouth stretched and contorted, growing wider to reveal two icicle-sized opal fangs. Eyes on her forehead and cheeks that weren't there before opened one by one; eight amethyst eyes glowed like cold gems and stared back at me. Rigid brown setae spread over her, and the creature grew larger, metamorphosing into something with clacking mandibles. 

# Lewis picked up a rock and hurled it at the abomination, chipping one of its fangs. "Why'd you have to play the hero?"

# My brain froze. I couldn't take my eyes off that thing. I was like a fly caught in a web. I picked up a fist-sized rock and pegged the beast in one of its orbs. It shrieked as its eye snapped shut; Gage kicked a leg out from under the creature, sending it crashing. Gage struggled to his feet; he flattened a wiry leg beneath his boot and ground his heel down hard as it screeched in agony; a pool of yellow fluid seeped beneath his steel toe. My hand pistoned out as Gage ambled towards me. I gripped his hand, sweaty and slick with blood. Lewis hooked his arms around his waist, pulled him up, and dusted him off. I hugged him, and Lewis ruffled his shaggy brown hair. 

# A web shot out of the darkness, plastered on his back and heaved him back down. Gage's eyes filled with tears as he stretched his hand out; the spider's silhouette engulfed him. Another web hit the door and slammed shut with a rattle. I yanked the handle, but it broke off in my hand. I punched the door until my knuckles were bruised, bloody, and cut. Helplessness washed over me like a gray tidal wave. Tears poured down my freckles.

#  Screaming. Shredding. Snapping. 

# All lanced through my mind like a hot iron spike. Pressure built in my brain until it felt like it was about to pop; this wasn't real. My skin felt cold and clammy as if I were sitting in the bath for too long. Gage was gone. "I-I had him. I fucking had him," I sobbed. 

# "W-we just can't leave him here," Lewis pushed me aside and wedged his fingers beneath the door. I squatted beside him and crammed my fingers below the door, splinters jammed under my fingernails. My muscles burned, and my hands went numb. We dashed for the van when the screams stopped. 

# I had him….

# At the police station, the cops side-eyes us as we told our story. Lewis kept sniffling and brushed tears away. I couldn't stop my lips from quivering. They didn't care about the drugs; the focus was on Lola and Gage. We told them we found a woman underneath a trapdoor in Yellow Brooke, and Gage jumped into the cavern to save her. They didn't find the door, nor did they find Gage or Lola. Lewis and I were prime suspects in his disappearance since we were the last ones to see him. Eventually, we were let go because there was no evidence Lewis or I killed Gage. Even though we were innocent in the eyes of the law, in the eyes of the public, we were guilty.

# A rumor that Lewis and I were Satanists and sacrificed Gage floated around campus. Some professors were visibly uncomfortable around me, and some even suggested that I transfer schools. Gage's family held a vigil in his honor. When I showed up, Brenna made a B-line for me. Brown hair dangled over red, puffy, seafoam green eyes. She hocked a loogie in my eye, slapped me across the face, and disappeared into the crowd. Someone scratched 'KILLER' into the hood of my jeep. His family also had the police in their sights; they publicly criticized the lack of effort to find their son and accused the chief of knowing what happened to Gage and covering it up at the behest of Lewis's parents.

#  The family announced that if the police wouldn't help them, they would conduct their investigation and find out what happened to Gage. Gage's parents, a few other family members, and friends went into Yellow Brooke, determined to find answers. They were never seen again. 

# After Yellow Brooke, I took school seriously (I couldn't let Gage's demise be for nothing). From then on, I stayed sober; drugs were just another reminder. I refused to date for a decade; every girl looked like Lola. Lewis skipped class and stopped hanging out with me; he was like a ghost. Lewis dropped out of college and got a job at FedEx, stacking boxes and dodging eye contact. A mutual friend ran into him at the bar a few years ago. Lewis was skeletally thin, sallow-skinned, working the graveyard shift at 7-Eleven, selling meth out of the back. Half of his teeth were gone, the rest piss yellow and rotten, and he wore a red flannel. Lewis said he saw the door in his dreams every night and always felt like something was watching him. His parents cut him off after Gage's vigil, calling him a liability, saying his rotten 'Satanist' stench tarnished their family's name and the firm's rep. Left him with nothing, they bolted to Florida. I read his obituary last year (I wish I had been there for him).

# Twenty years later, fear of that night still haunts me. I still wake up gagging on Gage's screams. His wide eyes seared into my mind. It should've been me. For decades, I buried Yellow Brooke deep inside: I sobered up, married Sasha, had a daughter, and started a business. Sasha held my hand at breakfast, and I half-expected her to rip it off. I swallowed the urge to peg Mia with a rock when she got off the bus this afternoon. A few times a year, I visit Gage's cenotaph. Last night, I saw a news story resurrecting yellow dread: three college kids went to Yellow Brooke. Two returned, and the other didn't: Gunther Gomes, 20. No corpse, no answers. The same helplessness that swallowed me all those years ago swallowed me again. Gage was twenty when he died. I got hammered for the first time in twenty years. It's too late for him, but not for you: please, stay the hell away from Yellow Brooke!
