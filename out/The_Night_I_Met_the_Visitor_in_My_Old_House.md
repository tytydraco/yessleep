It was just after midnight when I first heard the sound. A soft, almost imperceptible creak coming from somewhere downstairs. I had been working late in my study, tapping away at my keyboard, trying to meet a looming deadline. The house was dead silent, save for the occasional groan of old wood settling under the weight of time. It’s an old house—one that I inherited from my grandparents after they passed, tucked away in the quiet countryside, far from the noise of the city.

The sound stopped, and for a moment, I thought I had imagined it. But then it came again, louder this time, as if someone—or something—was slowly making their way up the stairs. I froze, my fingers hovering above the keyboard, straining to hear more. My heart began to pound, each beat a little harder, a little faster.

I glanced at the clock—12:13 AM. Who would be here at this hour? No one knew I was staying here, and I hadn’t invited anyone over. I stood up slowly, the chair scraping against the wooden floor with a harsh, grating noise that seemed to echo through the house. I cursed under my breath, then listened. The creaking stopped.

The silence was suffocating, pressing in on me from all sides. I waited for what felt like hours but was likely only a few seconds. Then, just as I was about to sit back down, the creaking resumed—closer now, right outside my study door. My blood ran cold.

I reached for the desk lamp, switching it off in one quick motion. Darkness enveloped the room, my eyes slowly adjusting to the dim light coming from the moon outside. I didn’t move, barely breathing as I watched the doorknob. It remained still, but the floorboards just outside my door groaned softly, as if bearing the weight of something heavy.

I wanted to dismiss it as the house settling, but every instinct in my body screamed otherwise. Gathering whatever courage I had left, I reached into my desk drawer, my hand trembling as I felt around for the small pocket knife I kept there. It was cold and reassuring in my hand, but it did little to ease the terror clawing at my insides.

Just as I was about to open the door and confront whatever was on the other side, the doorknob slowly, ever so slowly, began to turn. I froze, gripping the knife so tightly that my knuckles ached. The door creaked open a sliver, and a thin sliver of dim moonlight filtered into the room. I couldn’t see anything on the other side—just an inky darkness that seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy.

“Who’s there?” I managed to croak out, my voice barely above a whisper. The door stopped moving, hanging slightly ajar. Silence. 

I waited, my ears straining for any sound, but the house was as quiet as a tomb. I took a cautious step forward, my heart pounding in my ears. The knife felt almost useless in my hand, a flimsy defense against the unknown. I reached out with my free hand, slowly pushing the door open wider.

And then I saw it.

A face—pale, almost luminous in the darkness, staring back at me from just beyond the threshold. Its eyes were hollow, black pits that seemed to swallow the light. The skin was taut and waxy, stretched unnaturally over sharp cheekbones. But what froze me in place was the smile—an impossibly wide, unnatural grin that seemed to split its face in two.

My breath caught in my throat as I stumbled back, tripping over the chair and falling to the floor. The knife clattered from my hand, spinning out of reach. The thing didn’t move, didn’t make a sound, but its presence was suffocating, filling the room with a palpable sense of dread.

I scrambled to my feet, my mind racing. I had to get out. I bolted for the window, yanking it open with trembling hands, but before I could climb out, I felt a cold, bony hand close around my ankle. I screamed, kicking out with all my strength, but the grip was like iron.

The thing pulled me back, dragging me across the floor with inhuman strength. My fingers clawed at the wooden boards, trying to find purchase, but it was no use. It was dragging me towards the door, towards the darkness that seemed to pulse with life.

“Please, no!” I begged, my voice hoarse with terror. But it didn’t stop. It didn’t even pause. 

As it pulled me through the doorway, I caught one last glimpse of the study—the desk lamp overturned, papers scattered across the floor, the window still wide open, moonlight streaming in. And then, as the darkness closed in around me, everything went black.

When I woke up, it was morning. I was lying on the cold, hard floor of the study, the sunlight streaming through the open window. My head throbbed, and my body ached as if I had been in a fight. I looked around, expecting to see the face again, but the room was empty. The knife was still lying where I had dropped it, but the door was closed, and the house was silent.

I wanted to believe it had all been a nightmare, some twisted vision born of exhaustion. But the bruises on my ankle told a different story. I packed up my things and left that day, never looking back. The house is still there, standing silent and empty on the edge of the woods.

But sometimes, late at night when the world is quiet and still, I can still hear the creak of floorboards, the soft, slow turning of a doorknob, and the faint echo of a smile that chills me to my core.
