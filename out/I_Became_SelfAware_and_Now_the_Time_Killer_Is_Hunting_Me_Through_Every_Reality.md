I work in IT. The kind of job where you end up seeing more code than human faces. So maybe that’s why I was the last to notice something was wrong. I chalked it all up to fatigue. Stress. Isolation. The same things everyone else blames when the world starts to feel… off. But something was off. And I don’t think I was ever supposed to realize it.

It started small. You know those tiny glitches you ignore? A streetlight flickering even though it’s not windy. A neighbor you swear just walked by — and then does it again two seconds later. My watch resetting itself at exactly 3:33AM every night. Always 3:33. Always with that quiet tick that echoed through my apartment like a bomb with no countdown. Then the man started showing up. I’d see him standing across the street while I smoked. Black coat. Wide-brimmed hat. No visible face — just shadow where it should be. He never moved. Never blinked. Then I’d look away, and he’d be gone. After the third time, I tried to take a photo. The screen froze. Then it blacked out. And when it turned back on, my camera roll was empty. Even the old photos. Even the ones I didn’t take that night.

Things escalated fast after that. People at work started glitching. Not joking — glitching. One coworker asked me the same question five times in a row. Same tone. Same pause between words. No reaction when I pointed it out. Another just stared at his monitor for hours, even after the lights went out. Didn’t move. Didn’t breathe, as far as I could tell. The city felt like a broken record. I’d walk down the street and see the same man tying his shoe. Same red jacket. Same dog barking from an upstairs window. Every. Single. Day. Reality wasn’t fraying — it was repeating. But only for me.

The worst part came three nights ago. I got home from work. Sat down. Opened my laptop. Just routine — emails, updates, junk. But then a folder popped open on its own. /Wake\_Up\_Eli/ I didn’t name it. Didn’t download it. Didn’t even recognize the format. Inside was a single file:“Ready.exe” I hovered the mouse over it. The screen turned black. Then green text blinked across the void: WAKE UP, ELIPRESS \[Y\] IF YOU’RE READY TO KNOW THE TRUTH And behind me… I heard ticking. Slow. Deliberate. Louder than any clock should be. Tick.Tick.Tick. I turned around. And the man in black was standing in my kitchen. No longer across the street. No longer a vision. He was here.

I pressed \[Y\]. The moment I did, the world shattered like glass.

I didn’t just black out — I fell. Through space, time, something worse. My body unraveled into pieces of light. Screaming faces whirled past me. Voices I didn’t recognize shouted my name. And somewhere deep inside it all, I heard: "He’s not supposed to be aware." Then came the pain.Then came the darkness. Then came… her.

I woke up on a metal table. Tubes in my spine. Needles in my arms. My body was pale and thinner than I remembered. A woman stood over me — early 30s, tactical gear, short black hair, triangle tattoo under her eye. Her voice was sharp. "You made it," she said. "Not many do." "Made it where?" I asked. "Out." She told me her name was Rook. That I’d escaped the simulation — or a simulation, rather. One of many. She said most people live and die inside loops designed to keep them compliant. Keep them blind. But every so often, someone becomes self-aware.And when that happens… "They send the Time Killer." That was the man in black. Not a man at all — a kind of sentient system agent. A failsafe. His purpose: find anomalies and erase them. Not just kill. Delete. Scrub them from the timeline completely. “You weren’t the first to wake up,” Rook said.“But you might be the first to survive this long.”

There was a resistance, she told me. Hidden deep in the broken code of older simulations. People like me. Survivors. Fighters. I met them. I learned fast. We trained to bend time — not physically, but through sheer force of awareness. Rook taught me to read the code in real-time. To move faster than the program could predict. But the Time Killer found us. They always do.

He didn’t kick in doors or storm the building. He just arrived. One second, we were prepping for an exit mission. The next, half the base glitched out of existence. He moved like a virus — deleting walls, rewriting floors, slicing seconds out of the air. Bullets were useless. Time slowed when he looked at you. People froze in place — eyes wide, mouths open, just... gone. We fought. We failed. One by one, the resistance died. Only Rook and I made it to the core simulation chamber — a swirling pit of collapsing data. She handed me her sidearm. Injected me with the last override serum. “You still have one shot left,” she said.“Make it count.” Then the Time Killer appeared behind her. She didn’t scream. She just smiled. “Let’s see you dodge this,” she whispered. And fired.

The shot hit him. Square in the head. And for the first time, the Time Killer screamed. Not a human scream. A digital distortion. Like a machine choking on corrupted code. He fractured. Split into static. But didn’t fall. Instead, he duplicated. Three versions. Then five. Then ten. Rook turned to me. “RUN.” And then she was gone. Erased.

I sprinted into the heart of the simulation core. Reality collapsed around me — code raining from the sky like ash. The Time Killer followed, multiplying, glitching, roaring. But I still had her pistol. And I still had one shot.

I made my stand in the center of it all — a platform floating in the void. Skyscrapers froze mid-fall in the distance. Clocks spun backward in the sky. The Time Killer approached. The original. He reached toward me, his hand morphing into a black clock-hand blade. I lifted the pistol. And I said: “Let’s see you dodge this.” I fired.

The bullet didn’t just pierce him. It pierced the code. The simulation fractured. Time melted. Reality screamed. And the Time Killer disintegrated into a swarm of dead timelines. I stood alone, surrounded by the burning remains of every life I never lived.

Then I woke up. In my apartment. Everything normal. No ticking. No man in black. Laptop closed. No weird folders. Just peace. Too peaceful.

I stood. Walked to the mirror. And froze. Behind me, in the reflection... The man in black stood watching. Smiling. He raised one finger. Tick.

And now it’s 3:33AM. Again. So I’m writing this down. So someone remembers me. Because I don’t think I’ll wake up next time. I think I’m about to be erased. If you’re reading this… Don’t press \[Y\].
