I had to keep driving. After meeting the [priest](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yy23d5/i_have_a_friend_who_goes_grave_robbing_and_he/), I had to keep driving.

For fuck's sake, I was going to crash. I just knew it. I was being followed, not by a car, not by a person, heck, I was even alone in the car, I was being fucking followed by a presence, Death itself shall I say, fucking shit, all I could think was fear, fear, *fear.* The horizon was darkening and the street lights turned on. And this terror had taken over me. I would run out of gas and the thing would fucking get me.

Ahead of me, trees. Behind me, trees... The road was long and wide. Where was I going?

Suddenly, I hit the brakes. Something was blocking the road. *Oh, shit.*

It was close to midnight and I knew it couldn't be good.

The night was dark, but not dark enough to conceal. The silhouette again. It stood up, and walked closer, in a nightmarish, ritualic dance. It was a ghastly figure: hollow eyes, long arms and legs, unnatural and, yet, it was comical. It was trying to walk like a human. The creature was, though, horrifying: it looked like a bunch of shadows and skin thrown together. It 'walked' to my window and stared at me. This is how death looks like, I told myself. It's going to take me.

Then, it left. It walked back into the woods.

I thought I had died of fear, but apparently I hadn't. Sweat was dripping down my face, mixed with tears.

I took my phone and searched through my contacts frantically. My hands were trembling so hard, I accidentally called my aunt. *Shit.* I hung out quickly and kept searching.

*Jade S.*

*Jean from comms*

*Jem*

*Jenna.* That's it. It rang for a while, before she picked up.

'Dan?'

'Yeah, hi! Um, I'm sorry.'

'What's wrong?'

'I need your help. Do you happen to still talk to that guy you knew, the rituals antique kinda guy? You know, the one with the weird voodoo tables and shit?'

A short pause. 'What?'

*For fuck's sake.* 'That Kevin guy. Come on.'

'Kelvin, yeah, um, why? What could you possibly need from him? Are you suddenly into all that, or what?' she laughed.

'Nah, I just need to talk to him. There's this creepy guy at work who won't leave me alone because I promised to help him find some antique seller. I don't know.'

'Oh, okay. Yeah, I can give you his number tomorrow.'

'Can't you do it now?'

'All right. The guy must be really stalking you.'

*You have no idea.*

I called the Kelvin guy immediately. He didn't pick up. It was way over 1AM. Called him until he answered.

'Who is this?'

'Hi, is this Kelvin? The ritual antique guy?'

'Literally no one calls me that. Why?'

'I *really* need to talk to you.'

Pause. 'Okay, are you gonna sell me something?'

'I actually need your dark ass knowledge.'

'What? You want me to do what, dude? Are you drunk?'

'Listen, you need to help me. My friend sells souls and he fucked with the wrong thing and now some shit is chasing me and I think it's death. I have kids, man. I ain't dealing with all that.'

'Yeah, you're drunk. I don't know who gave you this number-'

'I know about the processes. Rupture, Wandering, I know all that. Please.'

I heard a long sigh. 'Fine. We can meet tomorrow, if you really want to. I'll text you.'

The next day, here I was, in this crusty diner, waiting to meet this Kelvin. He walked in and I suddenly realized why he chose such a career: the guy looked like a loser.

I explained everything to him. He stood silent for a while, then spoke.

'I know people like Theo. He thinks that just because he knows how to read a ritual book he can tame a demon. Demons aren't like us. They aren't fair. There are no terms and conditions to a transaction that is happening outside our sphere. Our world. He probably already sold his soul and he doesn't know it. The poor guy is gonna end up killing a bunch of people and then himself in a few years, because that's when the possession fully unveils. And what did he even get, because of this? Some money? A nice girl? Not worth it.'

'What was the thing that was following me?'

He narrowed his eyes. 'Um, that could've been Theo in his demon form. Probably. He said he wanted you to be his anchor? That's code for *I'm gonna try to use you in another ritual to regain my humanity, but I'm gonna kill you and probably the both of us will be doomed.*'

Well, that didn't sound good.

'So, what do I do? He won't leave me alone. I thought that was death.'

'Bullshit. Death follows people who died and can't go. Death is pretty harmless if it gets to do its job in peace.'

'What do I *do,* man?'

'You need to kill him before the demon takes over.'

Kill my friend?

'I am not a murderer.'

'Either that or have your family and yourself die by his hands. You pick.'

This was crazy. 'Fuck. How do I... how do I even do this?'

Kelvin, then, took out a book from his bag and talked me through one of the craziest things I had ever heard. Not only did I have to kill him, I also had to perform this ritual to make sure the demon wouldn't enter me. I needed salt, wax, matches, rope, and a knife.

'Listen. Kill him however you want. Poison him, for all I care. Just make sure he dies. Then, take the wax and melt it in his palm and left ear. Tie him to a stable thing, a tree. Circle him with salt. Read from this, and then cut the rope and bury your friend. Nothing will happen to you. Shit like this happens all the time, believe me.'

I'm not gonna lie, Kelvin didn't look impressed by the story. How often do people play with this stuff?

That night, I had sent my wife and kids away and returned to the house. I felt afraid, but, at the same time, I was curious. I called Theo and told him I'd help him. My heart was heavy, but I was going to do what needed to be done.

He arrived just like in the first night he had visited me. A familiar knock at the door, and when I answered, he was even wearing the same clothes. 'I'm so glad you can help me. You are a real friend.'

He didn't seem in any way: nor relieved, nor happy. He just seemed... distant. 

Walking to the kitchen, he did something unexpected. He tripped a bit, but his body moved almost unhinged for a moment. Had it already begun, the possession? Was I in danger?

'Anything for you.' I said. Fucking demon, I thought, I won't let you take my life and soul.

'Let me make you some tea.'

Theo accepted. He sat down at the kitchen table, in silence. As I was boiling the water, I saw the creature's reflection in the window. It stood behind him, still. I had to be brave.

'So, um, what exactly do I need to do? I feel like you're not telling me everything.'

'Too much knowledge can kill you. All you need to know is that you'll be my anchor and you'll be safe.'

'Don't lie.'

I couldn't stop, I was angry. Fucking liar. Possessed or not, he was *my friend.* 

Whatever. Our friendship had gone to shit when he decided to lie to me and I decided to kill him.

I then poured a cup. Enough poison to kill a horse. Gave it to him.

Theo smiled, but his eyes were hollow. He stared at the cup of tea in his hands. His knuckles were white, veins visible through his paper skin. For a moment, I thought he had found out my intentions.

Then he drank it.

That's it. I had killed my friend.

I went to the living room, leaving him in the kitchen. He would soon start to choke, go through all those stupid stages that I didn't wanna see. I would soon hear him scream.

I heard him put the cup down, then silence.

Morbid, dead silence.

Nothing. Minutes passed. I waited twenty fucking minutes. Then I heard footsteps and turned.

I froze. Theo was standing in the doorway, like a lost, fragile boy. His lips were trembling and his eyes were wide. He held his horrified stare at me. He was alive.

'What happened, Dan? Aren't you going to help me?'

'Did you like your tea?' I asked, trembling. *What the fuck?*

Theo smiled. 'Yeah...? A bit tasteless. Did you... put something in it?'

I didn't fucking understand. I took his hand and felt his pulse, and that's when it hit me.

*Nothing.*

You can't kill something that's already dead.

The glassy eyes, peculiar way of acting, pale face... He had died. The creature had been, in fact, Death, following Theo. Suddenly, it all made sense. Why the monster didn't want me.

'What did you say uh, you felt that night, when you made the transaction? The third being?'

'I told you, Dan. Still and old. Not a soul, not a demon.'

'Could that be death?'

He paused. He looked lost. 'Maybe. Sometimes - I read it somewhere - it can get mad that you fuck with its business.'

'Theo, Death didn't come for them. You are a good merchant. A... good... *businessman.*'

I could not believe it. Suddenly, it made sense.

'Theo, you died.'

I watched as my friend opened his mouth to speak, then closed it. He frowned. 'No. You're lying. I can't be.'

'How'd you get here?'

'I *drove* here.'

'Which car did you take?'

All he did was stare, disoriented. He scratched his head, took a few steps back. 'I don't understand. You're fucking with me.'

'When you felt the presence, did you finish the transaction?'

'No, I, uh. I don't think so. I couldn't.'

'Why?'

'I don't *fucking* know, Dan! Something intervened!'

'You lost your physical fucking form. You were no longer tied to your body, because you fucked with some voodoo shit too powerful for you and you died on the spot. The presence you felt was Death, wanting to take you. However, due to some stupid magic or because of whoever demon took you under its care, 'cause of the souls you sold it, you managed to remain here. You are being kept alive by this demon because it needs you here. And after it's done with you, it's probably gonna take your soul too.'

His eyes were full of tears. 'Nah, man, you're wrong. See, I did some good, *good,'* he spit out the words, '*research.* I am GOOD at what I do. I can't die. I'm not possessed by anything. A demon cannot enter you without your consent!'

'Yeah, when you are *alive!* This is why you wait for people to die to sell their souls! Not only did you die, you didn't even know it. You were cursed from the beginning.'

He frowned again. 'You're crazy.'

I felt about to scream. The clock was ticking. 'You are dead.'

'Fucking *prove* it!' he cried.

'*YOU are dead, because I fucking poisoned the tea, and you didn't die, which means you were already GONE!"*

Theodore stared at me. Confusion washed over his face, them anger. Betrayal. His lip trembled. Hands shaking. 'You tried to kill me?'

'I did. And look where that got me. You need to go. Accept it. You died.'

'Fuck no. You tried to kill me?'

''Cause you were fucking stalking me.'

'You're a bigger psychopath than me. I would have NEVER hurt you.'

'No, *you* wouldn't. But the thing inside you would have.'

'There is no THING inside me!'

'If you would just, um, go into the light, maybe you could escape.'

'I DIDN'T DIE!'

'Yeah? Well, tell that to the thing that has been standing behind you for the past 10 minutes.'

I had never seen someone so still, so afraid. He slowly turned around and faced the creature that had been terrorizing me. He didn't even scream. He just stared at it. The creature stepped towards him, then placed a long finger on his forehead. Theo suddenly shivered and fell to his knees. When he looked back up, I could make out something wild in him. Was it the demon? I needed to act fast. I grabbed the salt.

He understood. Suddenly, I thought I sensed something else in his look. Was it relief?

'So I'll leave.'

'Yeah. I'm sorry.'

'What will happen to my soul?'

Probably already owned by a demon, I thought. That's what you get for playing with shit you don't understand. 'You'll be fine.'

'You think?'

'Yeah.'

He looked down. 'I never thought it would end like that. Dan?'

'Yeah?'

'I need you to get the fuck away from here.'

What?

'Why?'

Theo sighed. 'I'm gonna let myself go, but it's gonna be ugly. If whatever demon wants to take me, it's gonna do it now, you need to run.'

I could barely speak, so I whispered. 'Okay.'

'They're gonna fight over me. I worked with plenty of them. I don't know when I'm gonna be at peace, *if* I will. But get out. Don't come back to this house, ever. Don't sell it. I cursed it.'

I took a few steps back, to the front door.

'Thanks, Dan.'

'For what?'

'For being my anchor. I needed you to help me understand.'

'You're welcome.'

And that's when I closed the door behind me and ran. Ran as fast as I could. I haven't seen Theodore since. I haven't returned to my former house.

It's been years. Nothing peculiar has followed. I'm good.

I still can't watch any horror movies because of that. I managed to get out mostly because of luck.

Please, if your grave robber friend knocks on your door late at night, don't answer. It's no good.
