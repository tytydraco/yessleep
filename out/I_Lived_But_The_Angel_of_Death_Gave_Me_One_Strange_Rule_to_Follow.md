Life is a fragile, flickering ember in a vast, indifferent night. I’d always thought about how easily it could be snuffed out—how quickly it could slip between the cracks. Death was never far from my mind; it wasn’t something I feared but something I felt an uneasy kinship with, as if the darkness had always been waiting, just outside my peripheral vision. Maybe it was because of the countless funerals, the whispered condolences, and the heavy, solemn silences that had clung to my childhood like a damp, suffocating fog. Or maybe, it was the grim fascination that bloomed in my chest each time I read about some poor soul’s end in the morning paper.

You grow up hearing the clichés: “Life is short,” “You never know when your time will come.” But they don't prepare you for how trivial, how fragile, it all really is. I found myself dwelling on these thoughts even more the day I saw my reflection staring back at me from a store window, the tired eyes, the sunken cheeks. I almost didn't recognize myself, like I was staring at a stranger caught in some private, wordless agony. It should’ve been a wake-up call, but it felt like a bad omen.

That day, the air was thick with the scent of rain and gasoline. I drove my rusted old car along the stretch of highway that cut through town, thinking about the time I had wasted, the jobs I had lost, the friendships that had dried up. There was an ache inside me, deep and gnawing, a frustration with the shape of my life and the endless, gnawing emptiness that nipped at my heels.

The rain started softly at first, just a gentle pattering on the windshield, but it grew into a torrential downpour, a curtain of water that turned the road into a river. I barely noticed when I passed the turnoff for home—my thoughts had drifted too far away. The music in the car was playing some melancholy tune, the lyrics washing over me without sinking in. Maybe it was that distraction, or maybe it was just fate, but I never saw the truck until it was too late.

The headlights came out of nowhere, blinding and hot, cutting through the rain. I slammed the brakes, but they locked, tires shrieking against wet asphalt. The car spun, my body lurching forward as if trying to escape the inevitable. The impact was violent—a crunching, splintering explosion of metal and glass. My head snapped back, and my body folded around the steering wheel like a rag doll.

In that moment, everything became a blur of red and black, a whirlpool of pain that seared through my ribs and snapped through my bones like brittle twigs. The air was filled with the coppery scent of blood, mingling with the acrid stench of burning rubber and engine oil. Glass shards bit into my skin, burying themselves in my face, my arms—tiny, gleaming teeth that tore through flesh and left me choking on my own breath.

The pain was all-consuming, an unending tide that crashed over me, pulling me down into a deep, endless cold. My vision dimmed, narrowing to a dark tunnel as the world outside the shattered windshield blurred into nothingness. I felt my pulse slowing, a sluggish rhythm, like a drumbeat fading into the distance.

For a moment, I thought that was it—that I’d finally reached the end of whatever strange and unremarkable story my life had been. But then, in that fading twilight, I saw something—something that shouldn’t have been there. A figure, standing just beyond the cracked glass, watching. A silhouette framed in the haze of rain, unmoving, like it had been waiting all along.

My last thought before slipping under was absurdly clear: I knew that face. I’d seen it before, somewhere—maybe in a reflection, maybe in a dream. But that realization faded, swallowed by the cold darkness that took me in its arms.



The world returned slowly, first as a dull, throbbing ache that pulsed through every inch of my body, then as a suffocating, metallic taste in my mouth. Consciousness crept in, unwelcome and hazy, dragging me back from the comforting, indifferent darkness I had drifted in. I opened my eyes, expecting to see the shattered remnants of my car, the highway strewn with glass and twisted metal, maybe even flashing lights or concerned faces. But there was nothing. Just a strange, cold quiet.

I was lying in a bed—a stiff, unfamiliar one, like those cheap motel beds with too-thin sheets and a mattress that smelled faintly of antiseptic. The walls were bare, no windows, no light except for a dim glow that seemed to have no source. It was as if the room itself exhaled a faint, sickly luminescence, barely enough to see by. I tried to move my arm, to test if I was still whole, but even that slight shift brought a fresh wave of pain, sharp and biting, cutting into my bones.

Then, out of the silence, I became aware of another presence. I hadn’t heard footsteps, hadn’t felt any shift in the air, but I knew I was no longer alone. A figure stood by the foot of my bed, half shrouded in the murky darkness that swallowed the edges of the room. My heart pounded, a sickening thud against my ribs, as my eyes adjusted, taking in the stranger.

He was tall, his frame wrapped in something dark and flowing, almost like shadows had gathered and clung to him. His face was pale, ghostly, and stretched with a tightness that seemed unnatural, as if his skin had been pulled too tightly over the bone beneath. His eyes were deep-set, black as voids, drawing in all the faint light around them. There was no expression in them, no spark of life, just an endless, impenetrable darkness. I knew, in some instinctive way, that this was no doctor, no rescuer.

He said nothing for a long, agonizing moment, simply watching me. The silence stretched until it felt like a physical weight pressing against my chest, making it hard to breathe. When he finally spoke, his voice was soft but unnaturally clear, each word cutting through the stillness with an almost surgical precision.

“You were meant to cross over,” he said, his tone devoid of warmth or malice. Just a statement, as simple and cold as if he were telling me the time. “But you hesitated.”

Hesitated? The word felt absurd, foreign. I hadn’t hesitated; I had been hurled into that blackness, helpless against the pull of whatever lay on the other side. Yet there he stood, as though my very struggle to hold on had somehow defied the order of things.

 “Who… Who are you?” I managed to whisper, but my throat was parched, every word a jagged scrape against my vocal cords.

For a moment, he didn’t answer, his head tilting slightly, as though studying some peculiar creature. “Names matter little here,” he replied, almost a whisper. “But I am what you would call the end. The last sight, the final word.”

The Angel of Death. The thought clawed at the edges of my mind, bringing with it a visceral, primal fear that twisted in my gut. But there was something else there too, something I couldn’t quite understand—a strange feeling, as if I’d seen him before, felt his gaze on me in some hidden moment of my life. Like he had been lingering in the corners of my existence, waiting for the right moment to reach out his cold, unfeeling hand.

“I… I don’t want to die,” I said, the words raw and trembling, a futile plea against the inevitable.

He offered no comfort, no reassurance. Instead, he raised one pale, bony hand and pointed to the far corner of the room. My gaze followed his gesture to an object that hadn’t been there before—a mirror. It loomed large and ominous, leaning against the wall as if it had been waiting for me. Its surface was tarnished and veiled with a haze, the kind of imperfection that spoke of centuries buried in darkness before being exhumed and placed here with deliberate intent.

“In life, you lingered on the edges,” he murmured, his voice distant yet impossibly close. “Staring too long into reflections, watching yourself as though you were an observer instead of a participant. You invited me in long before you realized it.”

A chill crept through my veins, an icy numbness that mingled with the dull haze of pain meds coursing through me. It was an unsettling sensation, as if frost had seeped into my blood, but even the chemical fog clouding my senses couldn’t blunt the oppressive weight of his presence. It was true—I had always felt a strange detachment, an unsettling awareness of my own mortality that had gnawed at me, even in moments of happiness. I had flirted with the concept of death, letting it dance at the edges of my mind, fascinated by the void that seemed both foreign and familiar. But this? This was something else entirely, something that turned my stomach with a sick dread.

“You have been given another chance,” he continued, his gaze returning to me, unblinking, unwavering. “But there is a condition.”

A condition. The words came with a heavy weight, like stones tied around my ankles. “What… what do you mean?”

His gaze flickered toward the mirror again. “Reflections are dangerous things. They hold pieces of us, echoes that can linger and grow, feeding on our fears, our doubts. You will return to your life, but there is a rule you must follow—an unbreakable rule.”

My mind raced, struggling to make sense of his words, to grasp the meaning hidden beneath his expressionless gaze. “W-what… what rule?” I stuttered, my voice barely holding together under the weight of the moment.

He stepped closer, his form blurring slightly as he moved, as if he were made of smoke and shadows. When he spoke, his voice dropped to a near whisper, the words crawling into my mind, embedding themselves with a painful clarity.

“You must avoid reflections. Mirrors, windows, any surface that shows your likeness. To look at yourself again is to invite me back, to open the door you’ve struggled so hard to close.”

The thought sent a fresh wave of panic through me. Never look into a mirror? Avoid every glimpse of my own face? It was absurd, impossible. But his eyes held no room for argument, no leniency.

“Break this rule,” he said, his voice as cold as the grave, “and I will come for you again. This time, there will be no second chance.”

With that, he stepped back, his form dissipating like smoke in the dim light, leaving only the faint chill of his presence behind. I was alone again, the room empty, the mirror a silent, looming threat in the corner.

A twisted gift, this “second chance.” It came with a warning as heavy as death itself. I knew, somehow, that breaking his rule would mean more than just losing my life.

It would mean losing everything that made me human.



Waking up in the hospital, surrounded by sterile white walls and the antiseptic smell of too many cleanings, felt like emerging from a nightmare only to be trapped in another. Machines beeped around me, cords and tubes trailed across my body like they were the last things tethering me to this world. I should have felt relief at being alive, at getting another chance—but the memory of that figure, of his pale, unblinking gaze, clung to me like a sickness I couldn’t shake.

Doctors came and went, offering sympathetic nods and speaking in clinical tones about broken ribs, fractured femurs, and bruised organs. They marveled at how lucky I was to survive. But the word "lucky" rang hollow. I’d come face-to-face with something far beyond the grasp of death.

Even as they assured me I would recover, I knew deep down that some wounds could never truly heal.

They let me go after a few days, as soon as I was stable enough to hobble around with a crutch. Friends and family came to see me off, their faces painted with worry and poorly disguised relief. I didn’t have the heart to tell them how hollow I felt, how every touch, every word seemed muted and distant, like I was hearing them through a thick wall of glass.

The ride home was uneventful, an irony that stung more than it should have. My brother drove, asking questions, trying to fill the silence with his own version of the story—how he’d found me, how close I’d come to “crossing over.” I only nodded, pretending to listen, though my thoughts were miles away, tangled up in that single, horrifying command from the figure in black.

As we pulled into my driveway, I saw my own reflection in the side window of the car—just a fleeting glimpse of my face, pale and worn, eyes ringed with dark circles. Instinctively, I turned away, heart thumping, the memory of his warning creeping back. I couldn’t remember ever feeling so unsettled by something as mundane as my own reflection. But now it felt like I was looking into the face of a stranger, someone I didn’t entirely trust.

Once inside, I let my brother help me to the couch, accepted his hurried well-wishes, and waited until he’d closed the door behind him. The silence that followed was thick, stretching through the empty house, pressing down on me with a weight that was almost unbearable. Every reflective surface—the polished glass of the framed pictures, the dark TV screen, the small hallway mirror near the front door—suddenly felt like it held a dangerous secret, each one a trap waiting to be sprung.

I shuffled to the bathroom to grab some painkillers, keeping my eyes firmly fixed on the floor, avoiding even the briefest look at the mirror above the sink. The pills tasted bitter, their acrid tang washing down with a sip of stale water. My throat felt tight, as if some unseen hand was squeezing it, reminding me of the warning I could never shake.

Days blurred together as I settled back into my life, if “settled” could even describe the constant, lurking dread that colored every waking moment. I avoided mirrors, as he’d commanded, keeping every surface in the house covered or carefully turned away. But avoiding reflections entirely was impossible. Glimpses of myself in car windows, store displays, even puddles on the sidewalk felt like tiny needles pricking at my skin, a reminder that his warning was still there, hanging over me like a blade.

One night, a week after my release from the hospital, I caught a flash of something in my peripheral vision. I was passing by the hallway mirror on my way to the kitchen when a shadow moved behind the glass. My pulse quickened, my eyes darting toward the mirror before I could stop myself. It was just a flicker, a brief blur of darkness that shouldn’t have been there, vanishing before I could fully register it.

I backed away, heart pounding, reminding myself that it was just a trick of the light, a figment of an overactive imagination. But somewhere deep inside, I felt a chill settle, as if something was watching. That night, sleep eluded me, every sound in the house amplified, every shadow feeling too close, too intrusive. I lay there in the dark, listening to the soft creaks and groans of the walls, the quiet hum of the refrigerator, each sound feeding the gnawing sense of dread that had lodged itself in my gut.

The next day, I made a decision. I covered every mirror in the house, draping old sheets and towels over them like they were corpses lying in state. The bathroom, the hallway, even the small vanity in my bedroom—all of them hidden from sight, sealed away. It felt ridiculous, a futile effort against the irrational fear that gripped me, but I didn’t care. I had to do something, anything to protect myself from whatever curse that figure had woven into my existence.

Life became a strange, monotonous cycle after that. I avoided reflections, turned away from every chance glimpse of myself, even stopped looking at photos that might remind me of the face that was now forbidden. Friends and family drifted in and out, offering sympathy that felt empty, reminding me that I’d “come back from the edge.” But they didn’t know the truth. They didn’t know that the edge had followed me home, that it lingered in every reflection, waiting for the slightest slip.

And then, on an otherwise ordinary evening, it happened. I was reaching for a glass in the kitchen, lost in thought, when the TV screen—left off and dark in the corner of the room—caught my eye. I saw my own face reflected there, half-shadowed in the dim light, an accidental, forbidden moment that lasted no more than a heartbeat.

But in that brief instant, I saw it.

It wasn’t just my face staring back at me. There was something else, a dark silhouette behind my shoulder, half-formed, blurred and indistinct, but unmistakably there. I froze, breath catching in my throat, a surge of cold dread washing over me as I turned, half-expecting to see him standing there in the room with me.

Nothing. Only empty air, the faint hum of the refrigerator, and my own panicked breath echoing in the silence.

I whipped back around, staring into the dark screen, but whatever I’d seen was gone. The shadow, the figure—vanished. Yet the feeling remained, a bone-deep certainty that I was not alone.

The promise he’d made echoed in my mind, a sinister reminder. Breaking the rule meant inviting him back. I could feel it, the pull of his presence drawing closer, like something lurking just beyond the reach of my senses.

In that moment, a realization washed over me, sick and heavy: it wasn’t only my face that was dangerous now. My reflection had become something else entirely, a doorway between worlds, a fragile barrier keeping him at bay.

And somehow, I had cracked it.



The days that followed were a waking nightmare. The figure in the mirror, the shadow that loomed just over my shoulder, didn’t vanish. If anything, it became more persistent, more vivid. Every reflection—no matter how fleeting—held a sinister, unnatural clarity. A glint of movement in the corner of my eye, a shimmer of something just beyond the surface of the glass, taunted me relentlessly. The warnings he’d given weren’t abstract anymore; they were living, breathing threats pressing against the edges of my sanity.

I stopped leaving the house entirely. I didn’t trust the world outside, where reflective surfaces were unavoidable. The polished sheen of a car window, the glint of a puddle on the sidewalk, the cold gleam of a doorknob—any one of them could betray me. My home became a fortress, every mirror covered, every reflective surface dulled or destroyed. I sanded the finish off tables, smashed the bathroom mirror with a hammer, and taped black garbage bags over the windows. But even with these desperate measures, I couldn’t escape.

The reflections found me.

I began to see him in the most mundane places: the stainless steel faucet in the sink, the darkened TV screen, even the glass of water I tried to drink from. He was there, always watching. His pale, hollow face seemed closer each time, his black eyes like open graves swallowing every shred of light. He never moved, never spoke, but his presence was suffocating. The air felt heavy with his gaze, a weight I couldn’t shake no matter how tightly I shut my eyes.

Paranoia consumed me. I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep. My body grew weak, hollowed out by fear and hunger. The house became a tomb, the silence punctuated only by my ragged breaths and the occasional creak of settling wood. I started to question my own mind, whether any of this was real. Was he truly there, or had my brain betrayed me, crafting horrors out of guilt and fear?

But no matter how much I tried to convince myself otherwise, the evidence kept piling up. The figure wasn’t confined to reflections anymore. I began to see him in places where no reflection should exist—lurking in the shadowed corners of my vision, standing at the foot of my bed when I awoke, his form pale and skeletal in the half-light. He was creeping closer, invading every part of my reality.

And then came the whispers.

They were faint at first, indistinct murmurs that could have been the wind or the creaking of the house. But they grew louder, more insistent. His voice was low and gravelly, dripping with malice and ancient certainty.

“You cannot hide,” he would say, his words coiling around my mind like smoke. “You cannot escape what you are.”

I tried covering my ears, stuffing them with cotton, even blasting music loud enough to rattle the walls. But nothing worked. His voice wasn’t coming from outside—it was inside me, curling through my thoughts, poisoning every moment of silence.

One night, the pressure became too much. The whispers grew into a discord, a ceaseless barrage of voices that clawed at my sanity. My reflection had become my tormentor, my face a vessel for his malevolence. It wasn’t just fear anymore; it was hatred. I hated my own eyes—their very presence felt like a betrayal, as if they held the power to draw him closer, to let him in. Even unseen, they burned in my mind, an unshakable weight pressing against my sanity.

And that was when the answer came. Simple. Brutal. Final.

I couldn’t look if there was nothing left to see.

The tools were still in the garage, gathering dust from my frantic renovations. My hands trembled as I grabbed the screwdriver, its cold metal biting into my skin. I told myself this was the only way, that I could end the nightmare if I just took control. The whispers cheered, growing louder, more frenzied, as if urging me on.

In the bathroom, I stood with my head down, my gaze fixed firmly on the bloodstained tiles beneath my feet. I refused to lift my eyes, refused to risk even a glimpse of the glass shards still clinging stubbornly to the frame. I didn’t need to see to know what awaited me there—his face, his shadow, unyielding in its presence.

The air felt heavy, oppressive, the whispers crawling through my mind like worms. My breath came in shallow gasps as I gripped the screwdriver tighter, the metal cold and unyielding in my trembling hand. My knees buckled slightly as I knelt, the edge of the countertop digging into my side. The smell of blood, sweat, and fear hung thick in the air, almost suffocating in its intensity.

The voice spoke slowly, almost mockingly, its tone dripping with a sinister weight that pressed into my mind, filling every corner with its dark presence. “Take control. Take it away from me.”

But I didn’t hesitate. Not this time. I pressed the tip of the screwdriver to the corner of my left eye and pushed. The first puncture was white-hot agony, a burst of unbearable pain that sent shockwaves through my skull. My scream ripped through the silence, raw and guttural, as blood poured freely down my cheek, warm and slick against my trembling hands. The pressure in my skull felt like it would split me open, my head throbbing in time with my racing heartbeat.

But I wasn’t done.

The second plunge was harder. My body resisted, muscles twitching and convulsing as I forced the screwdriver deep into the socket. The sound was sickening, a wet squelch followed by a crunch as the tip scraped against bone. The pain was unimaginable, a searing, all-encompassing fire that left me gasping, choking on my own sobs. My vision exploded into a kaleidoscope of white and red before fading into absolute, merciful blackness. Blood pooled beneath me, dripping from my chin, soaking into the fabric of my shirt.

And then—silence. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, the whispers stopped.

I collapsed, the cold tile pressing against my face, my body shaking with violent, wracking sobs. Darkness enveloped me, total and all-consuming, but there was a strange peace in it.

No more reflections.

No more shadows.

*No more him.*

 

I woke to a world of silence and darkness. The sterile scent of disinfectant and faint beeping of monitors tethered me to reality, but the absence of sight was jarring, disorienting. I reached for my face instinctively, my fingers brushing against rough bandages that covered my eyes, shielding whatever was left beneath them.

"You're awake," came a familiar voice to my left. My brother. His tone was careful, wavering, as if he wasn’t sure how much I could handle. I turned my head slightly toward the sound, but the movement was sluggish, as if my body were moving through water. "They said it was... touch and go for a while. You lost so much blood." He hesitated, his chair creaking as he leaned closer. "They managed to stabilize you, but... your eyes—" His voice cracked, and he fell silent.

I heard the scrape of his hand across his jeans, a nervous gesture I knew well.

"John?" I croaked, my throat raw and dry.

“I just... I came as soon as I heard, and—” Jonathan’s voice faltered, his breath hitching like he was holding something back. “Why?” he started to say, but the word hung unfinished in the air.

After a moment, his tone softened. “You know I’m here for you, don’t you? Always.” His hand closed around mine, steady and firm, as if trying to tether me to reality. “You’re safe now. Whatever it was... whatever made you do this—it’s gone. It’s over.”

I nodded faintly, the weight of his words settling over me. For the first time, I realized how desperately I wanted to live. Even in this darkness, even broken and blind, I had never valued my life more than I did now. The weight of Jonathan’s hand in mine was proof that I hadn’t lost everything—that maybe, just maybe, there was something worth holding onto.
