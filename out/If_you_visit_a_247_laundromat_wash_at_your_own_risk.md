In the heart of the sprawling mountainous city, where neon signs flicker like dying fireflies, Ryn and Pip navigate their cramped RV—a refuge from both the mundane and the malevolent.

Ryn, with her wild curls and eyes that shift between stormy gray and electric blue, is the chaos gremlin—the one who laughs when the generator sputters, who dances in the rain as if it’s a cleansing ritual. She wears mismatched socks and a leather jacket adorned with patches from forgotten punk bands.

Pip, on the other hand, is the quiet heartbeat of their nomadic existence. Their skin bears the scars of battles with demons—both literal and metaphorical. They brew herbal teas to soothe Ryn’s nerves and whisper forgotten spells to keep the shadows at bay.

Their four dogs—each with their own quirks—complete the odd family. There’s Lucky, the blind terrier mix who navigates the RV with uncanny precision. Fenrir, the wolfdog, guards the entrance, his eyes glowing amber in the moonlight. Luna, the husky, chases her tail in circles, blissfully unaware of the supernatural forces that surround them. And then there’s Nyx, the doberman, whose intelligence rivals that of any human.

The demons—twisted, ancient things—trail them like hungry wolves. They whisper secrets in the night, promising power and pain. Ryn and Pip have learned to decipher their cryptic messages, but sometimes the price is too much.

One moonless night, when the generator coughs its last breath, Ryn and Pip huddle together. The demons claw at the thin walls that separate them, their voices a cacophony of despair and hunger.

“We can’t keep running,” Ryn says, her fingers tracing the sigils etched into the RV’s ceiling. “We need answers.”

Pip nods, their eyes reflecting the flickering candlelight. “We’ll find the forgotten library—the one hidden beneath the city. There, ancient tomes reveal truths and lies. Maybe we’ll discover why the demons haunt us.”

And so, with their dogs at their side, Ryn and Pip venture into the city’s underbelly. They’ll face forgotten gods, spectral librarians, and riddles that twist reality. But they’ll also share laughter over burnt coffee, and Pip will teach Luna to howl at the moon.

"WTF kind of bull#*%^ is that?!" Ryn practically scream-laughed as she read over the generated text. She wasn’t sure which inaccuracy was most ridiculous.

"It's not BS!" I shouted, crossing my arms with an indignant pout. I’d been planning to write about our misadventures for a long time, but have trouble getting my thoughts together, or even knowing how to start. I was testing out various types of intros with Copilot, not to have the AI write it for me, but to draw inspiration and get my writer’s gears going. That funny excerpt will be the only contribution from the program, so don’t worry. We had initially considered publishing our exploits in a blog, but quickly gave up on that idea altogether. There’s no way that anyone would believe a word of it. But here on /nosleep seemed like a good, safe option where we shouldn’t be judged. I've lost friends in the past after sharing about our otherworldly experiences, so hopefully things work out better this time. I’m in desperate need to get our story out there, and at this point I don’t care who believes it.

I’m Pip, and my lovely potty-mouthed wife is Ryn. Those aren’t our real names obviously, but they’re close enough. No other names are going to be changed, and I already made sure it was alright with anyone that might appear here. I also opted not to change the name of our dogs. We have four, and I’m too lazy to come up with four new names and consistently remember them. Together, we live and travel in an old RV and of course, we regularly deal with inexplicably strange events, many terrifying, including a pair of ancient demons that have tormented us since childhood. Currently, we’re parked in a Coloradan city, sticking mainly to industrial areas where we’re less bothered. This will likely be the first in a series of our exploits that I'll be sharing, depending on how things go.

"HEY!" I dove for my laptop as Ryn highlighted the text, presumably to delete it. “Don’t you dare!” I shouted, holding back laughter of my own. The hilariously inaccurate AI-generated bit wasn’t going to work, but it was too funny to just erase without sharing.

Ryn’s mischievous grin only widened as she hovered her finger over the delete key, clearly enjoying my reaction. "Fine, but you at least need to make sure it’s accurate. None of this AI crap." Ryn stabbed an accusatory finger at the first paragraph. "For one, my hair is not that curly! And my eyes are hazel. They don’t change as much as yours, and you're the weirdo who likes leather jackets."

She continued. "You barely have any noticeable scarring, and the dog's names and genders are all wrong. It's Nova, not Lucky. Kyra, not Fenrir, and they’re all girls, thank you. Our dumb husky is Aura. Luna will be the next dog." Ryn grinned at the little pattern they had going with dog names. "And our doberman is Hela. Nyx is your cousin's name!" She gave a playful shove and handed my laptop back over to me.

I sighed and closed the lid, putting the device to sleep. "And this city is anything but serene. Maybe if you go west into the mountains. I also doubt there's anything below it but sewage, beer cans and expired dispensary licenses." A smirk began to form on my face. "But hey, it's a start. I thought the description it gave of the demons was a nice touch."

Ryn rolled her eyes and ruffled my choppy purple hair. "How about you put that aside, and actually help me load the laundry into the car? Or did you forget we were doing that tonight?" She teased.

I looked with dismay toward our RV's cramped livingroom, currently the location of about a dozen garbage bags stuffed with several weeks worth of laundry. Times were tough and we hadn't been able to afford going to the laundromat for a while. Nodding, I went to grab the first of many heavily packed bags. Of course, the weight would be nothing for us.

Loading four boisterous dogs into a midsize SUV was a challenge in itself, not to mention the mountain of laundry that needed to be crammed into the trunk. It felt like an exercise in futility. Our youngest two dogs whined excitedly, but we did our best to tune them out with ballads of alternative music on our way to the laundromat. Hela in particular tended to calm whenever we played music. She was picky about what kind though. The laundromat we chose was the only one open 24/7. This was an especially huge benefit to me, seeing as I can’t be out in daylight anymore.

Nova was the only dog we brought in with us, given her age related fragility. Hela had a tendency to antagonize the poor old lady when left together in the car. With us, she’d mostly sleep on the bed I made for her on the floor. Since it was the middle of the night, we doubted the owner would mind either. He normally brought his own dog with him, some kind of bully mix.

An out-of-place wooden restaurant booth, painted an obnoxious mustard yellow, sat in the front of the laundromat. The air was thick with the scent of detergent, and heavily humid. I suppressed an involuntary gag and wrinkled my nose. The rhythmic hum of washing machines, and classic rock music from a worn out radio created a constant background noise. Even in the middle of the night, you could always expect to see one or two other people. After bringing in the laundry, I seated myself with my laptop, hoping to work on my story some more… only to realize my laptop battery had inexplicably gone from seventy to ten during the fifteen minute car trip, and the wall outlet was too far from the booth.

"Crud muffins..." I muttered, electing instead to play some mindless mobile games after helping Ryn to load the first few machines. My eyes already felt heavier without more mental stimulation.

"Battery dead again?" Ryn asked. Seeing my nod, she tutted. "Way to go, Freakazettoid." She booped my nose, her tone teasing but still affectionate.

I lightly smacked her arm over the nickname she'd christened me with. Glitchy electronics would forever be a part of our lives, and I was used to the teasing from those who knew the cause. Working in fast food years prior had been… an adventure. By the time I’d left, my coworkers – managers included, were all calling me Thor. Fun times.

It wasn’t long before my phone battery began to dwindle, and I put it away, lest I suffer a repeat. My bored, chronically tired eyes perused the walls of the old laundromat, skimming over the basic rules posted in big black blocky letters; no running, don’t leave laundry unattended, etc. Many of the walls were the same weird yellow color as the booth. My eyes hurt and my stomach growled. “Do we have enough quarters to get a snack?” I asked as Ryn strolled back to the booth with a now-empty laundry cart.

“Oh, maaaybe…” Ryn replied, drawing out her answer with a smile.

I grabbed one of the neat stacks of quarters and scurried over to the vending machines. Most of the labels were familiar, but a few elicited an eyebrow raise. What the heck was Void Velvet, or Whispering Wafers? The rest of the packaging was illegible and had no pictures of what it contained. My upper lip twitched and I was sorely tempted to get one of the weird treats, but instead settled on a bag of Funyuns. As I anxiously waited on the old, worn-out coil to spin and release my snack, a sudden shout from behind me made me jump.

“GET INTO THE F-ING BALL, MOTHERF—!”

I turned to see Ryn glowering down at the screen of her Switch and grinned. “Having trouble, dear?” My question drew a stream of curse words and typical gamer ranting from Ryn, to which I snickered. A soft plop drew my attention back to the machine and I quickly retrieved the chips. Something sticky touched my hand and I nearly dropped them. As I went to carefully draw out the yellow bag, a small pink feather, sticky with something red, dropped to my feet. I wrinkled my nose and side-stepped over to the other machine. The drink machine looked newer and, for the most part, contained ordinary drinks; save for one at the bottom labeled Stardust. Wasn’t that the new Coke flavor? Weird. It was written with a sharpie on white paper, instead of an actual label like the others. Of course. I settled on an orange Fanta and returned to the table a moment later. Catching Ryn off guard, I suddenly slammed the cold can down on the table. “Who loves orange soda?!”

Ryn startled and narrowed her eyes at me. "You're not Kel."

My manic grin dissolved into a pout. “And you're no fun.” I retorted before going to knock back the soda, nimbly dodging as she attempted to swat the can.

“And you’re a dork.” Ryn shook her head, instead giving my arm a shove.

Just as I was about to remind her whose dork I am, our banter was interrupted by the laundromat’s door opening. A tall young man walked in, wearing an old beat up blue hoodie. He was black with a big friendly grin. Despite not carrying any laundry, he seemed perfectly at ease and he took a seat near the door.

We were more curious than nervous about the sudden appearance of this man. Ryn and I normally don't interact with strangers much, but we felt at ease with him. Still, we decided not to speak unless he initiated the conversation; which he did.

“Hey there!” The dim glow of the laundromat’s fluorescent lights cast eerie shadows around the stranger, almost like a dark halo, but that was probably my imagination. “I just love the smell of fresh laundry. What’s got you out so late?” he asked as though discussing the weather. His eyes twinkled as he viewed us with curiosity, as though we were the strange ones; which we were, but that’s beside the point.

I pulled a face, wondering how anyone could love the sickly sweet scent of about a hundred different detergents. “Not a fan of the sun, or most people,” I replied, taking a long sip of my orange soda. “I’m Pip, and this is Ryn, and that’s Nova.” I gestured to my wife and our sleeping old dog as I named them. I expected the man to introduce himself. As though in response to my thought, his smile widened. Ryn got up to transfer the first few loads of wet laundry to the dryers. The man leaned forward slightly, as though sharing a secret.

“Ever see anything weird, especially this late at night?” the unnamed man asked, his raspy voice softening into a more somber tone.

Ryn and I both groaned at the question. “Well, that’s a loaded question,” That almost immediately led to further probing. I mentioned a few of our more recent exploits; like how I recently found a rock that hums, and when we conjured my grandpa’s ghost so I could recover my favorite jerky recipe from him. But it was only when I let slip something about the demons that the man seemed truly intrigued. He had a lot of questions, and I was happy to answer most of them, but I refused to divulge their names. Names hold power. There was no way either of us were risking their attention that way. I expected fear, maybe even skepticism from the man, but there was neither. He still wouldn’t give any information about himself. I just assumed he had his own strange experiences if he was that invested in ours.

The sudden buzzing of a dryer made me jump and I glanced at Ryn. Just how long had we been talking? It was my turn to tend to our laundry and I got up to do so. Ryn’s game was paused on the menu screen, which was unusual for her. She normally wasn’t this engaging with other people aside from me.

The dryers were on the other side of the building, but I could still catch pieces of conversation from Ryn and the stranger. At some point while checking blankets for signs of dampness, the laundromat door opened again. Another middle-aged man, shorter than the first, stumbled in with several mesh bags of laundry. He appeared to be struggling with the weight. The first man got up and offered help, which he graciously accepted. Ryn appeared to be leaving some kind of trance and resumed feverishly playing Pokémon Scarlet. Shaking my head, I continued sorting through and folding the laundry that was fully dry, and depositing coins for whatever needed extra time.

By the time I returned to my seat, the second man had gotten his laundry started and was chatting it up with the first dude. They seemed to be hitting it off pretty well, and the second introduced himself as George. There was a pause as he waited for the taller gentleman to give his own name, and when he didn’t, George asked for it. The resulting silence was immediate and stifling. The air was so hot and thick, I nearly choked on it. I couldn’t see the taller man’s face, but the other man appeared confused, almost disoriented. Pulling my phone out, I tried to make it seem like I hadn’t noticed anything amiss. I heard the door open again and the two men stepped outside.

A strange prickle of fear went down my neck and I focused harder on my Facebook feed. The haunting melody of “Sympathy for the Devil” drew out from the radio, eliciting an eye roll. I’d deduced that the man wasn’t normal, but he was no devil or demon. Fae, maybe. I almost expected Hela to start barking when the men went out, but our dogs were thankfully quiet. Probably napping, as they tended to do.

The doors creaked open again, which sent my heart momentarily racing. But it was someone new. A young woman with a head full of auburn curls entered, carrying a fuzzy snub-nosed dog under her arm. She wore baggy sweats and looked utterly exhausted, dark circles under her eyes. After transferring her wet laundry to a cart (apparently she'd started it earlier), she appeared to have trouble finding an available dryer. There was only the dryer on the end, with an ‘out of order’ sign taped to it. She hesitated for a moment, her brow furrowing in frustration, before snatching the sign off and electing to risk using it rather than waiting for another to open up. When she was done, the now-disgruntled woman took a seat by the window and began browsing her phone with one hand, her manicured fingers tapping rhythmically on the screen. The dog squirmed upon seeing Nova and she hesitantly let it down to investigate. Nova barely paid any attention to the scruffy little guy, who quickly lost interest in our old lady. I attempted to strike up a conversation by asking the dog’s name or breed, having guessed he was at least part pug, but the woman wouldn’t so much as look up. Ah, well.

I returned to my mindless scrolling, the glow of my phone screen casting a faint light in the dim laundromat. The next customers to arrive were a young couple who could barely separate long enough to get any laundry done. It ended up being the guy loading their small basket of clothing into an available machine, while the girl stooped in front of the snack machine. I expected her to choose one of the run-of-the-mill goodies, and was surprised to see her select a bright red and yellow candy bar with indiscernible wording. One of the weird snacks. Well, good luck.

Her partner rejoined her a couple of minutes later, and I shamelessly eavesdropped, anxious to see what the package might contain. After an annoyingly long session of quiet chatter in what sounded like Spanish, soft giggling, and more PDA, she finally opened it and took a bite. From where I was sitting, it just looked like an ordinary chocolate bar. The girl started to chew, but deliberated after a moment, frowning. Her expression went from lovey-dovey to unsure, and slowly morphed into one of pain and terror. The chewed-up sticky morsels of chocolate were quickly spat out on the floor as she began to wail and grasp at her mouth.

The boyfriend jumped into action, and for a moment I couldn’t see the girl as he blocked the way. I heard violent gagging and retching, and began to feel sick myself. Next thing I knew, he was dragging her out the door as quickly as he could while still being gentle. I didn’t catch any glimpse of her face, but was that… blood on the floor? Yikes. The unfriendly woman’s dog came sniffing over, and I quickly held him back with a foot. Ryn apparently didn’t notice a thing either, as she was still fixated on her Switch. Sighing, I grabbed some napkins and cleaned up the bloody spittle and chocolate from the floor. I didn’t want whatever that was to make the dog sick. Wearing a look of disgust, I disposed of the napkins and the remainder of the candy bar in the trash bin. I didn’t think to inspect the wrapper more, but there did appear to be cartoonish flames on the otherwise plain design. Talk about biting off more than you can chew.

As I was about to sit down, something acrid and coppery reached my nose, making me pause mid-motion. Now, I’d just cleaned up some blood but this was more pungent. I slowly crept toward the back of the laundromat, where the smell grew stronger, each step heightening my sense of unease. The dim lighting cast long shadows, and I spotted a dark, viscous substance oozing out of a dryer—the out-of-order one. Pretty sure that wasn’t from her clothes.

“Uh… hey, there’s something wrong with your clothes,” I called to the woman, not expecting much of any response. Surprisingly, she glanced up and regarded me with a glare, her eyes narrowing and upper lip curling.

“What’d you say?” she snapped, her tone sharp and defensive.

“Your clothes? You should check on them,” I slowly answered, wilting a little from her attitude.

The woman, who I mentally dubbed Karen, rolled her eyes at me but still went to check. I tried to ignore the resulting shriek of disgust as she opened the dryer door, gagging at whatever filth the fluid was. As Ryn likes to say… eff around, find out. Karen tried in vain to salvage her clothes from the machine, her hands trembling as she pulled out the soaked, ruined fabric. She quickly gave up, swearing under her breath about lawsuits. Scooping up her dog with needless ferocity, she stormed out of the building, leaving a huge mess behind. I felt bad for the morning cleaners who would have to deal with the aftermath.

Thankfully, that dryer wasn’t anywhere near ours, and I had the uncanny ability to ‘switch off’ my sense of smell—something weird and useful that I’d developed after a stint with covid. I took a deep breath, grateful for the reprieve from the stench, and returned to my seat, the incident lingering in the back of my mind.

For the last little bit, the radio had been buzzing with random chatter from the DJs, but now I heard a song starting. It was one that I absolutely LOATHE, and I hastily drew out my earbuds. Ryn was seemingly already wearing some. When did she put them in? Shaking my head, I hit play on my music player, immediately greeted by one of my favorite songs by Shinedown. Tucking my phone in my pocket, I briefly stepped outside to check on the other dogs in the car. As suspected, they were all happily dozing, their bodies sprawled comfortably across the seats. It was a cool night and we'd left the windows cracked, so I knew they were fine. I hurried back in before they could hear me and wake up.

On my way back inside, I met a guy in his forties on the way in with a tall basket of clothes. His face was rugged and weathered, with fine lines decorating his features. Like some of the other patrons, he looked disheveled and sleepy. His short, graying hair was slightly messy, and his faded denim jacket hung loosely over a plain white t-shirt. He pushed the door open with his back, then moved to hold it open for me, which I thanked him for. Hopefully not too loudly, as I still had music in my ears.

I returned to my seat and fiddled with my phone until I noticed the battery was waning even worse than before. I darkened the screen but left the music playing. The man deposited his laundry and took a seat, but appeared fidgety. He kept glancing uncertainly at the radio, his eyes darting around nervously. I tried not to let on that I was watching him, but his nervous demeanor was getting to me. Maybe they were playing a song that he hated?

I didn’t immediately notice anything wrong until I warily removed an earbud, and realized the radio was repeating one lyric over and over: “I see a red door, and I want it painted black. I see a red door, and I want it painted black.” Over and over, with a rising distorted metallic shriek increasing in pitch somewhere in the background, as the voice continuously deepened. I quickly tucked the earbud back into my sensitive ear, wincing at the sound. It must have gotten worse, as the man began clutching his ears and stumbled out the exit, looking panicked and in pain. I found myself grateful that Ryn and I had our earbuds, and that Nova was mostly deaf. Our old lady barely stirred at all from the commotion.

I’d nearly forgotten my orange fanta with everything going on. The chaos around me seemed to blur into the background as I brought the fizzy drink up to my lips. I was grateful to find it hadn’t gone completely flat yet. Just as I was about to take another sip, a sudden prodding on my shoulder nearly made me spill it. I cautiously removed an earbud, relieved that the radio was back to normal and amused to hear the familiar ballad of “Carry On Wayward Son” by Kansas.

“Don’t forget, you need to wash your shoes too,” Ryn reminded me, her smirk mirroring the one that was probably on my face. What can we say? Supernatural was a great show, even if it got most things wrong.

I loaded up the last pile of dirty clothes into a washer, the nearby machine’s metallic clang echoing in the quiet laundromat. I topped it off with the soft gray slippers I’d been wearing, feeling a bit odd being barefoot in a public place. It was late, so I didn’t think anyone would actually care. I just hoped the floor wasn’t too dirty. After the machine was started, I tiptoed back over to Ryn, the tiles cool and smooth under my feet. I managed to sneak up on her and goosed her in the ribs. It earned me a hard smack on the head, but it was still worth it. Giggling, I returned to my seat and pulled out a notebook. I figured I’d better take some notes with everything that had happened so far, in order to maintain accuracy. Our laundromat adventures would make good fodder for my very first post.

It was anyone’s guess what other kind of shenanigans might happen next, but I definitely didn’t plan on it being something to do with the floor itself. It started with a mild itch, which grew to a tingle and then a burn, as though ants were biting the underside of my feet. Was I having an allergic reaction to the cleaner used on the floors? I vigorously rubbed my feet together, but when the feeling grew to pain, I ended up picking my feet up to inspect them. My soles were growing an angry red and appeared to be blistering, as though I’d dragged them across hot coals. What the heck?! Ryn noticed when I picked my feet up and shook her head.

“Looks like the laundromat isn’t a fan of your dirty bare feet,” she attempted to joke.

My eyes narrowed. “Oh yeah? Well, this means you can finish the laundry until my shoes are done,” I pointed out, grinning as this dawned on her, causing her shoulders to drop in mock defeat. I inspected my feet again but couldn’t see any debris or substance that should be causing such a caustic reaction. Upon closer inspection, the floor itself didn’t appear out of the ordinary either, so I had no idea what was going on. One of the posted rules was no bare feet, so I suppose they really took that rule to heart. It didn’t appear to affect Nova or the other dogs at all though, so I was grateful for that. I rubbed my aching feet, but the burning was already subsiding, and the blisters were minor. I’d be fine. I was curious how quickly or severely it would affect other patrons, but I doubted this was a common mistake.

Sitting with my feet up wasn’t the most comfortable, but at least we were close to being done. The hard wooden booth dug into my back, and I shifted, trying to find a position that didn’t make my legs fall asleep. After I finished with my notes, I got out my coloring book to give myself something constructive to do while waiting for the machines to finish. The vibrant colors and whimsical designs were a welcome distraction. Ryn got the final load into a dryer, pausing momentarily to give a disgusted look at the one on the end. She glanced up at me, and something about the look sent me into a fit of laughter. Her nose wrinkled in distaste, and she quickly gave up getting any answer from me, resorting to using one hand to hold her nose and the other to flip me off.

“What was that?” Ryn pressed when she returned to the table, her voice muffled by her hand.

“Someone used the out-of-order dryer, and you know what they say. Eff around, find out,” I answered with a shrug, trying not to think about the correlation between the dryer’s suspicious contents and the missing man from earlier in the night. Nah… I’m sure he was fine. Maybe a prisoner of the fae, but certainly not dead and pulverized, right? Shaking my head, I returned to coloring a cute picture of a baby chupacabra, when something dawned on me.

“Hey, did you remember to take the purple blanket out? I’m sure it’s done by now.”

Sighing dramatically, Ryn got back up and went to look. She opened the dryer, frowned, shut and reopened it. Then she checked the dryers that surrounded it. “Are you sure it was over here? I don’t see it.”

Feeling frustrated and worried over one of my favorite blankets, I leaped out of my seat, ignoring the burning of my feet when it started up again, and hurried over to examine the machines myself. Sure enough, the blanket wasn’t there anymore. I was sure nobody else had grabbed it either.

“Go sit down, I’ll find it.” Ryn gave a light shove and nodded toward my feet.

“Oh, I’ll be fine,” I stubbornly retorted, only returning to my seat when I was sure none of the other machines were hiding it. It wasn’t really weird or scary, but super frustrating. One of the posted rules did say something about not leaving any laundry unattended. I didn’t think it was in there that long, but who knows? Maybe some dryer gremlins stole it. Maybe the same ones that ate someone and left their torn up remains in one of the machines. I gave a dark chuckle at the mental image and tried to imagine how such a creature would look. Ryn was called a chaos-gremlin sometimes, and I decided to ask her later if she had any cousins that fit the description. An idea was coming together in my head, and I began to slightly bounce in my seat from anticipation. I only looked up to a loud clank as Ryn dramatically shut the dryer.

“Alright, the last load should be done in just a few more minutes,” Ryn informed. “I’ll bring you your shoes, and then you’re gonna help me fold everything.”

I pretended to put up a protest, but Ryn knew me too well and threatened to bite me if I didn’t help. I withheld my comment, instead sticking my tongue out at her.

It was indeed only a few minutes before the final machine buzzed, and Ryn was on it immediately, not willing to risk a repeat with our actual clothes. If the dryer stole her Kingdom Hearts hoodie, she’d probably torch the place. I could see the dark sky turning a bruised purple as it grew closer to sunrise. After donning my slippers again, I helped Ryn lint roll the dog hair from everything, and then fold it all up. More cars pulled up outside, and I could hear our other dogs begin to stir and bark when anyone came near.

As we began to pack up our stuff at the table, I saw a teenage-looking girl get out of a van with a fluffy animal in her arms. I expected a stuffed animal, or maybe another dog until she came in, and I heard the most concerned meow I’ve ever heard in my life. I’m not sure what I expected, but it was definitely not what happened. An intensely deep canine growling fired up in the office, followed by manic digging at the wooden door. The girl’s eyes widened, and she quickly began to make tracks back outside, but not before the door started to splinter at the corner. I expected the manager’s bully mix dog, but something didn’t quite look right about the face leering out. I instinctively went to pick Nova up, who grumped at me, as something came crashing through the splintering wood. The girl screamed and retreated to her van with the startled persian cat, who was no doubt shredding her arms to ribbons. The manager stepped out from the ruined door a moment later, regarding the traumatized onlookers with a sheepish smile.

“Sorry… he hates cats.” That was the only explanation he uttered before running out to grapple with his… dog? Well, whatever it had turned into. The cat was unharmed, so I for sure wasn’t judging him. I gave Nova a little squeeze and ignored her grumbling.

Ryn and I exchanged a glance and shook our heads, on the verge of laughter. The only one of our dogs barking by that point was Hela, which was no surprise. Our doberman was gentle but she wasn’t afraid of anything. She once even tried to go through a window to get at one of the demons. We waited until the animal was contained back in the office, as best as the guy could feasibly manage given the condition of the door, and then began carting our laundry off to the trunk. I dealt with Nova last, as there was still one remaining order of business I needed to take care of before we left.

I pulled out my notebook, and after jotting down the rest of what happened, flipped to a blank sheet of paper and began to write.

Rules for the laundromat:
Don’t ask other people for their names, and be careful giving your own.
Do not eat or drink the off-labeled snacks and drinks.
Bring earbuds/headphones. If a song starts repeating on the radio, use them and don’t take them off until it stops.
Do not use any machine if there’s an out-of-order sign on it.
If you see a machine start leaking anything weird, alert the manager.
Keep shoes on at all times.
Do not leave laundry unattended in a machine for more than ten minutes.
Behaved dogs are allowed, but cats are not under any circumstances.

When I was done writing the rules, I tore out the page and carried it over to the bulletin board on the other side of the snack machines. Ignoring Ryn’s judging look, I carefully pinned the sheet to the board and stood back to admire my handiwork. Hopefully, the next patrons read and followed the rules better than everyone else did tonight.

Ryn called to me from the car, gesturing to the lightening horizon. I scooped Nova up again, buckling her in next to the other dogs who were out of their minds to see me, and joined Ryn up front.

“Did you really just do what I think you did?” Ryn groaned, starting the car.

“Yes. Yes, I did. And you can deal with it.” I yawned, plugging my dead phone in. As we pulled out, I could have sworn I saw the same tall stranger from earlier in the night greeting someone at the door, and he flashed me a knowing smile. I gave a friendly wave and we were on our way back home.

This isn’t our strangest encounter by far, but it is the most recent, and as good a starting point as any. There are countless others, each more bizarre and chilling than the last. I will no doubt be adding to my collection regularly. As Ryn and I like to joke, we are lightning rods for the weird and scary. So, if you’re intrigued by the unknown and have a taste for the deliciously dark and supernatural, stay tuned…
