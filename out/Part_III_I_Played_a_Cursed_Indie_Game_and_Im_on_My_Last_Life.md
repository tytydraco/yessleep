I saw them everywhere after that night.

It was so gradual that I didn’t notice at first.

I saw people with blurred faces, the sky glitching blue, black, and grey. In the dark, a shadow followed me from room to room. It twitched, and its spine burst from its back like the wings of a desiccated angel.

I was becoming undone, and I wondered how long Benji had taken to unravel.

Despite that, I played the game as much as I could.

It was slowly becoming an obsession.

I still went to work, fed and played with Marmalade, kissed Anya, and admired her cute butt.

But during my downtime, I played, and I played, and I played.

I found more objects, unearthed sinister clues, and ran into the mansion’s inhabitants, who skulked through the halls faceless and moaning.

I never saw Benji, and I didn’t know if that was good or bad.

I progressed in the game and explored the second floor, which provided more hints, and introduced the game’s antagonist.

Its name was HUNT.

The game did not instruct me how to beat it, so I hid and ran. I listened and watched from shrouded corners while it devoured everything in its path.

Anya didn’t like me playing; actually, she hated the game. She had watched me play again, her face was stony, and without a word, she reached out and shut my tablet off.

“You shouldn’t play this anymore,” she told me.

“Why?” I asked. “What did you see?”

But she wouldn’t tell me, and whenever I took the game out to play, she would leave the room with Marmalade in her arms.

She grew distant, and I didn’t care. Who was she to tell me what to do?

I knew things were going downhill, but I couldn’t stop even if I wanted to.

And I didn’t.

I looked for Benji. I searched for him everywhere. Sometimes I found pieces of him in crevices. Clumps of hair tangled in spider webs, splinters of bone wrapped in torn fabric.

I stood by the steep stairs he had led me to.

“I died here,” he had said, pointing to the staircase slick with gore. “My skull exploded.”

I could see it happening so clearly. I could hear the wet gurgling as he took his last breath.

# ❧

# It was raining the next time I lost a life. Anya was working a double and wouldn’t be back until late, so it was just Marmalade and me.

She slept by my feet, and outside, the world roared. Rain lashed at the apartment’s windows, and thunder shook the room.

The lights flickered once, twice, and then went out.

I held my breath and waited for it to turn back on. It did not.

Groaning, I got up and groped blindly until I remembered I was stupid because my tablet had a flashlight. I turned it on and shone it into the darkness.

I screamed.

HUNT watched me in the dark. This video game nightmare had come to life and towered over me. It had tangled dirty hair, and a hunched broken back. Its breath came in sporadic gasps and whistles. I couldn’t see its face, and for that, I was glad because I knew it would look like Benji.

I didn’t know what to do. I was frozen. Fuck, why didn’t life come with a walk-through? Why did Benji send me this fucked up game? Why did I continue to play even though I knew it was haunted?

Marmalade hissed, and I broke out of my negging trance. I picked her up and ran out of the apartment. HUNT was right behind me.

The walls crumbled, and the ceiling caved in. The floor eroded, and with Marmalade clutched in my arms, we fell down this fucked up rabbit hole, drifting past mangled faces and disfigured limbs.

I landed on my back the wind knocked me out of me. I struggled to breathe again and watched as the mansion built itself around us. We were in the game.

When I could move, I realized we were at the top of the staircase, and Benji was below.

Benji lay at the bottom landing, His neck was punctured by jagged bone, and his brains were spread around his head like a grisly halo.

Marmalade flung herself out of my arms and landed on his chest. I watched as her pink tongue lapped at his dark blood. I turned my head and vomited.

“Marmalade!” I hissed. My head was spinning. “Marmalade, stop it!”

She looked up at me and hissed with bloody teeth. Her furry orange face transformed into something bestial, hungry.

I watched, horrified, as my precious kitty mutated as she crept up the stairs toward me. Her limbs elongated and became human, and her face changed and changed and changed.

Most of the faces I did not know, and it did not shock me to see mine and Benji’s flicker across its features. The last one knocked all the wind out of my lungs. I struggled to breathe.

Anya. Pretty Anya, whose pixie features made her look like a Black fairy, stared back at me. I would think it was her if that dirty black hair wasn’t framing her face and her teeth weren’t stained with Benji’s blood.

Why did HUNT have her face? As far as I knew, it only took your features when you played the game, and Anya hadn’t played so.

Wait. Fuck. Anya, what the fuck? Why?

My vision went white with sudden pain, and then everything went black. When I came to, my neck was burning, and dark blood splattered onto the floor. My fingers crawled over the wound and came away red, purple, and black. The light was fading, and so was the pain.

I lay dying on the mansion’s dirty floor, HUNT standing above me, licking its bloodied fingers.

It leaned over me, and its face was Anya.

Its lips spread in a smile, and in Anya’s voice, it said,

“You’re finally home.”
