I hated the way my brother’s teenage boys treated my grandfather on the holidays. My grandfather is 93, and he hasn’t been himself for years. Dementia. 

My grandmother is a few years younger and still sharp as a tack. She refused to put him in a care facility, and nothing my mother said ever changed her mind.

This Thanksgiving, my grandfather was sitting in his chair. My brother’s sons were on their phones sitting on the couch next to him. 

I watched my grandfather try to talk to them as best he could. I guess it annoyed them. So they thought it would be fun to mock him.

“What are you boys doing?”

“Just lookin’ at stuff.”

“Well… tell Pop Pop what you’ve been up to.” Jeremy, the oldest at sixteen, smiled.

“Mostly gooning.”

“What?... What did you say?”

“I’ve been doing a lot of gooning, Pop Pop.” They both started to snicker.

“Gooning… YOU’VE been gooning?!” My grandfather got a little animated. I swear I saw a light in his eyes I hadn’t seen in five years. His voice sounded stronger.

“All the time, Pop Pop.”

“Well… ya know…” He leaned forward and he started smiling. “You don’t want to say that too loud. I never told anybody about my gooning. I thought I was the only one.” 

“Oh I do it all the time. Three times this morning.”

“Is that right?! Three in one go?! It must be in the blood! I haven’t been gooning since Nan caught me twice in 1954! She put her foot down. No more gooning; said she’d leave if I did it again! She doesn't know I did it a couple of times behind her back after that.” The kids laughed hysterically and so did my grandpa. 

I’m Gen X. I had no idea what the hell that meant to kids, so I Googled it.

“You should just do it, Pop Pop. Why not do it one last time before you croak!” 

“I still have my tools. Maybe I’ll do it tonight!” The kids were laughing so hard they were crying. 

I got the search results. I grabbed both of the little shits by their collars and dragged them out of the room.

For the rest of the day, my grandfather was beaming. Far more lucid than we’d seen in a long time. Something had woken up inside of him. He was happy. I didn’t tell my grandma what the boys did. It would have made her mad.

When I left that night, I went to give my grandpa a hug. I told him that I hoped he had a good night. He smiled and looked at me out of the corners of his eyes.

“Oh, I think I will.”

It bothered me. His voice was low. It wasn’t even the weak version of the voice I always loved as a child, it was the voice of someone else. Someone I didn’t know.

I had a hard time sleeping that night. Twice, I felt like I should drive over to my grandparents, but I didn’t.

I woke up early and I got to my grandparent’s house around seven. The front door was open. I walked inside and called out for either of them, but there was no answer. I went into their bedroom and that’s when I found my grandmother lying in the bed with a bullet hole in her head. The room was a mess. It looked like someone had ransacked it. There was a small wood box with red satin lining inside sitting on the floor. A few bullets were inside, but nothing else. I couldn’t find my grandfather.

I called 911. The cops were there within ten minutes. They had already been on a call less than a mile away at the mall. There had been a shooting.

My Grandfather was arrested. 

He had obviously gotten into an argument with my grandmother. We’re pretty sure that he shot her, left the house, and killed three people in a parking lot with his old .22 pistol. He had carved the letter “G” into their foreheads with an old pocket knife. 

When the cops stopped him, he threw his hands up in the air. He said, “You finally caught me! I just wanted to go gooning one last time.”

I was told this morning that there are 27 unsolved murders from the 1940’s and 50’s on the northeast coast. A .22 caliber was used in every one. A “G” was carved into the victims foreheads. The killer was dubbed “The Gloucester Goon” after the police received several taunting letters. 

Grandpa’s been confused since his arrest. He doesn't remember anything. He keeps asking for my [grandmother](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyhorribles/).
