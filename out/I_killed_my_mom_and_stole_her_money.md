The sweetness of the moment was short-lived. I savored it as I walked through the door with the stolen money. I knew my mom would be devastated. I didn't want to hurt her, but I needed the money. I had no choice.

The clinking of the coins in the bag echoed in the stillness of the house. I tried to be quiet, but my heart was pounding so hard, I was sure she would hear it. I crept through the living room, avoiding the creaky floorboards. Just as I was about to enter the kitchen, I heard her voice.

"Who's there?"

I froze. She couldn't see me, but she knew I was there. I had to think fast.

"It's me, mom," I said, trying to sound calm. "I just wanted to surprise you with a little something."

"You shouldn't have broken into my house," she said, her voice shaking. "You're lucky I don't call the police."

"I'm sorry, mom," I said, trying to sound sincere. "I really am. I just needed the money."

She was quiet for a moment and then she sighed. "All right," she said. "Just put the money back and we'll forget this ever happened."

I hesitated for a moment. I could put the money back and pretend like this never happened. But then I would be right back where I started. I needed this money. I had to take the risk.

"No, mom," I said softly. "I can't do that."

I moved slowly, as the fan crept on me. "Stop right there!" She screamed fearfully as I kept moving. "I SAID STOP!" 

I put my hand in my pocket, leaving a reaction-less face. "Don't take it personal, mom." I said, as I pulled the pocket-knife out of my pocket. My mom backed up, and I ran in.

I killed my mom, it was nice, it felt good. I never felt like that my whole life, and didn't think I'd feel like this. I hid the body, and reported her as a missing person. Nobody knew it was me, and nobody will ever know. I took the million dollars, and moved to the United States, it was truly the best decision of my life. 

After moving to the United States, I knew that I had to start over. I had to leave my old life behind and begin anew. Part of that meant breaking into my mom's house and stealing 1 million dollars. I did it because I knew that I could never start over if I didn't have the money. And so, I took the money and ran.

I didn't know what to do with myself after that. I felt guilty and scared and I didn't know where to go or what to do. So, I ended up just wandering the streets, aimlessly. I knew that I had to find a way to make things right, but I didn't know how.

Eventually, I decided to turn myself in to the police. I knew that it was the right thing to do and that I needed to face the consequences of my actions. I was arrested and charged with burglary. I did not tell them about the murder. I spent time in jail, but it was worth it knowing that I had done the right thing.

Today, I'm starting over again. I've learned from my mistakes and I'm determined to make something of myself. I'm sorry for what I did, but I'm grateful for the second chance.
