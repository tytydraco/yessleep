I wake up on a regular sunday morning. Thinking to myself happily ‘I have no work’. I love the weekends since (obviously) work and school is off. I prop myself up on my pillow and wait for the rest of my body to wake up. 
I grab my phone off my bedside table.
‘Yo you up?’ I text to my friend Jack.
After a few minutes he responds ‘yup I am where we heading?’ 
‘Cinemas?’ I reply
‘Sure’ he texts
I jump up, throw on a tracksuit and coat, and head out of my front door. As I walk out of my door I feel a rush of cold air hit me. I see my warm breath spinning and fading infront of me. I turn around and lock my door. 
As I turn up the street Ten minutes later I see a person in all black with a scream mask on walking towards me. I cross over the road and so does he. I stop. The person does too. It pulls a pistol out of its pocket and I hear a loud pop…

I wake up on a regular sunday morning. I feel my head. It was just a dream. Instead I think to myself happily ‘I have no work’. I love the weekends since (obviously) work and school is off. I prop myself up on my pillow and wait for the rest of my body to wake up. 
I grab my phone off my bedside table.
‘Yo you up?’ I text to my friend Jack.
After a few minutes he responds ‘yup I am where we heading?’ 
‘Cinemas?’ I reply
‘Sure’ he texts
I wait. This is exactly like the dream I just had…
As I get out of my door I slowly lock it. I turn around and ,instead of going the quick way I would usually go to the cinemas, I go the long way. 
As I turn down the ally way. There I see it. Up the ally I see a person in all black, scream mask on and pointing the pistol at me…

I wake up on a regular sunday morning. I feel my head. What just happened? What IS happening? I prop myself up on my pillow and wait for the rest of my body to wake up. 
‘Yo Faust you up for coming out?’ Jack texts me
‘Nah I need to head out to Asda now’ I lie
‘Kk’ he reply’s
As I get out of my house after 10 minutes of sitting in my room then getting ready. I lock my door and get into my BMW. When I sit in and close the door. I feel a rope wrap around my neck. I struggle and try pulling the rope off but the harder I resist the harder it pulls back. I feel my lungs yelling for air but none comes. I feel myself loosing consciousness…

I wake up on a strange Sunday morning. I think to myself ‘what the hells going on’. 
My phone dings and a message appears after half an hour of laying there. 
‘Yo you up for coming out?’
‘No i am going to stay into today’ I reply to Jack
‘Kk’ 
I get up and walk downstairs. I sit on my couch with my clothes one re-evaluating what’s going on. ‘Is it a dream?’ I think. After 5 minutes of sitting I hear the safety catch release on a gun… 

I wake up on a strange Sunday morning. 
‘How does this person know where I am?’ I think
After half an hour of thinking a ding comes off my phone. And I have a thought. Jack? No he is my friend. I’ve known him for 18 years. We are friends… Aren’t we?
