Looking back at it, i think i know exactly why it all came down to it, why i had to become a frantic runaway, paranoid of the things lurking in the corner of my eye, why i couldn't stop even for a second, not to eat, not to sleep, not even to relieve myself, why this ever-extending mass of joints, vaguely shaped like a human, and adorned in a jacket seemingly labeled with the insignia of every major federal agency, alongside a few of them that i was certain don't exist was hot on my trail.

There at it chest laid these symbols, going in order of real agencies to utter nonsense the further down the they were placed. The Central Intelligence Agency, The Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Department of Defense, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Justice, and so forth, and so on. Every inch of the jacket worn by the creature was covered in those insignia, which as children we were taught to fear, and to respect. The deviations only began at it's unbelieveably thin midsection.

There were a couple of now-defunct agencies and offices spread around, oddities of history, but there was also a lot of nonsense, no other way to describe it. Among those, a few stood out as especially outrageous. The DD(Department of Democide), AHC(Agency for Highway Creation), The CCCC(Cultural Context Castration Committee), NCEP(National Council for Enviromental Pollution), GRSD(Golf Rumours Supression Department), BPOCC(The Bureau of Psychological Operations and Cattle Control(The symbol featured a bovine front and center..)) Those were only the most legible ones among the mass of symbols spread across the monster. The more attention one paid to the fine details, the more insane and schizophrenic the whole picture seemed to become.

As i've said at the very beginning, i know exactly why this "man"(If indeed one could call him that.) was sicked on me. It all started with a delivery like any other.

I was, and suppose no longer am, what's known as a low-level operator. I'm far beyond getting in trouble with the police now, so i might as well speak freerly about it, however, consider the names and accompanying folklore behind criminal figures related to me as fabrications meant to throw off any future inquiries. There is hardly a reason to drag others down with me.

I've gotten into the "business" on behalf of a friend, Rudolf, a long-time junkie and a dealer. "Oddly" enough, it was meds that got him started. He was a wild kid, and so, of course, they got him on benzodiazepineÂ analog, Xanax. Hard stuff. It was all downhill from there, but i'd hang out with him regardless. Anytime he would screw up whatever job, and come back to our hometown to live with his parents for a bit, again, we'd meet and we'd have fun.

He would often offer to include me in on the junk. I rejected. He appreciated that i've long given up on trying to get him off the stuff, and i appreciated having someone to chat, and go on long walks through the forest with. Even if by the end i'd inevitably had to drag his now-unconscious body on my back, all the way back to his mom's. It made for some great memories, hearing him mumble on about whatever nonsense, as the sunset closed in around us, and all the little woodland critters skittered about. I miss those times now more than ever.

During one of our walks i've mentioned my financial struggles, and he offered a tantalizing offer of a part-time job. I was swayed by the promises of a swift and easy paycheck, even moreso, one which for the obvious reasons, would evade taxation.

I was never briefed about the exact working of the organization he distributed for, nor have i cared to pry. All i knew is that Rudolf, streetname "DONNY-BOY" answered to a single superior. Every few weeks, Rudolf would come around and pay out what he owed, then he'd get more stuff to sell, or ingest. His boss, streetname "Swab", did not care whether he skimmed off the top, or whether he upcharged and made extra for himself. If Rudolf paid for the supplies and his margin, everything was as "Swab" used to put it, "golden". I liked that about our boss, the sort of a greedlessness one couldn't expect even out of a world leader.

My job was simple. Dead-drops, and the relay of information between relevant parties. A couple of times a week, i'd meet with a guy at the local Burger King, no electronics on person, never in regular intervals, and there, i'd be passed instructions for the month. It usually averaged four dead-drops a week handled at my discretion, and at my responsibility. The information relay tasks were infrequent. I suspect i was filling in for someone else, or perhaps it doesn't take much of an information transfer to keep a criminal empire alive.

I usually got up early, around four, drove out into the boonies following the specific geographical coordinates, dug out whatever cache, and then delivered it later in the day at the specified location and time.

I did exactly as i was told, never asked a single question unless absolutely relevant, never looked into any of the packages i had to handle, and i never messed a delivery up, not once.

"Swab" seemed to appreciate my reliability. Half a year in i was offered a promotion, an enforcer position. Four times the pay, but i'd have to get my hands dirty. I rejected the offer and resumed my routine. "Swab" was dissapointed but understanding.

Before i departed from my promotion meeting, he told me the following.

"Lad, the fact you declined, is precisely why i wanted you to take the job. You can't even imagine how many fuck-ups you have to babysit in this "industry". Lads like you are rare" -He waved his hand in the air vaguely. "Diamonds." "You get instructions, you follow them, you don't come crying for more money than you know you're worth, and what's most important, you don't get these-... these fantasies of patricide.

We had to put down a delivery boy just like yourself last week. He was using, and that must've made him think he was the shit. Started off small, with a stolen package or two. Then he tried to shank one of my guys. I put em' down. That's why they call me "The Swab", you know. I take out the grime, and i get dirty. I don't send my guys out unless necessary, i handle my busine-"

I stopped him there, and pretended not to have heard the latter part of the conversation, hoping he'd take the hint. I was fine working with the man, but i did not care one bit for his business, especially if it made me a witness to murder.

He quickly understood my position, and waved me off, once again remarking that, "See? That's why you're golden, lad." I knew then, that even if i had to testify against the man, i wouldn't. It may sound insane, but he was by far the best boss i've had to date.

I don't know if it's the sheer wit necessary to "make" it in the criminal world, or if he was just truly a great guy, but he seemed to avoid the usual inflation of ego that followed the aquisition of a management position. Not only that, he was also content with just letting me do my job. It's surprising how rare that is.

Years went on, i continued my part-time work with no hiccups, and minimal interference with my daily life. Donnyboy- Rudolf, had died of overdose month prior. I suppose it was an omen of things to come.

The morning it all went to shit, i got a call on my burner. A man whose voice i didn't recognize told me there'll be an additional delivery today, it wasn't me who was meant to handle it, but my predecessor had been put under surveilence by the authorities.

It wasn't the first time something like that had happened. I suppose it was the reason as to why i had been employed in the first place. Routine leaves patterns, and those are easy for the law enforcement to exploit. The only unusual part of the delivery was that once i've recovered the box, i'd have to bring it straight to "Swab" himself. This had never happened before, degrees of seperation and all.

Nothing note-worthy happened on my drive to the spot. When i knelt down to dig the box out of the shallow dirt in which it has been covered, i noticed another odd thing. The box had barely been hidden. It was sticking out padlock-first. It looked like someone just "forced" it into a patch of soft dirt instead of putting in the effort into proper burial. At least it saved me some time. I sighed, and picked it up.

The second unusuality, was that whatever cargo was inside, wasn't properly secured. I could feel, and hear it rolling around as i've tilted the box from side to side. It felt like-. some sort of a sludge, inbetween a solid and a liquid, slowly moving in globs throughout the container. Someone's done a hack job, clearly. I wondered what possibly could have made someone prepare the package in such a haste. The drop-site was out in the middle of nowhere. Once there, you'd have nothing to worry about, nothing that could force you into a hurry, and no witnesses to be wary of. Just you, the box, and whatever patch of dirt. Then, i recalled that my coworker was being surveilled.

I looked around the nearby woods in a sudden bout of paranoia, spending a solid five, ten minutes scouring the landscape in search of anything, or anyone. It was autumn, and it wouldn't be another hour and a half until the sun rose. That didn't help. Eventually my gaze rested on a particularly suspicious mess of branches. I stared daggers into it, trying to spot a glint of light, the shape of a human, or anything else out of the ordinary.

From behind me i've heard the creature speak, it's voice clear and legible, to an almost supranatural degree. The only part of It that wasn't wrong.

"In the USA alone, more than half a million people go missing every year. That's... thirteen million people since the beginning of the second millenum. Where do you reckon they all go?"

It's words cut through the ambience of the forest the way a bullet would.

I bolted upwards, attempting to turn around and face the creature at the same time. I fell over in the process, and it loomed over me calmly. I rose my head high towards the source of the voice, still clutching the package tightly to my chest.

What welcomed my eyes was the most bizzare sight. It looked like an anemic stilt-walker, except with the stilt's grown into it legs. It wasn't \*as\* bizzare-looking as it'd come to be, but still far from normal. It didn't adhere to human proportions, not even the way joints were supposed to be placed.

Every limb it had was longer than it should've been, stretched out like a piece of fabric about to be torn. The legs didn't bend how they were supposed to. It looked like it had an additional knee, the curve of the leg changing it's direction as it went between the two. It didn't wear pants, just some sort of a rag tunic wrapped around it's hips. It contrasted heavily with the jacket. The midsecton was thin and worm-like, the chest bulging as if it were swarming with some sort of unholy vermin.

It's limp arms gravitated towards the ground, as if hoping to offer additional support to the whole of the structure. I don't know if It was meant to stay upright, but it did just that in spite of it.

The face looked the most human out of all of it, save the utter lack of hair, including eyebrows, and the paleness of it's skin. The eyes were covered by a pair of thick sunglasses, and i was certain it could see me well, in spite of the darkness surrounding us.

At the time, i didn't have the chance to examine the bizzare insignia of it's jacket. I saw some official-looking symbols, and decided immediately to rush towards my vehicle. My mind was struggling to understand the situation. Was it a fed? It didn't look human. Could it have been the darkness messing with me? Whatever It was, it couldn't have been good to stick around it, so i kept running.

It outran me with just few ginormous stilt-walker steps, and stood in front of the hood of my truck calmly, just as i've made it into the cabin.

I wasn't thinking straight, and i engaged the ignition, fully intending to ram through it. Then it crouched over, leaned down so that it's torso and elongated legs were perfectly parallel to one another, and bent it's head beyond what's humanly possible to be eye-level with my windshield, stopping me dead in my tracks.

"Gas engine. Good." It mimicked puffing a cigarette with it's empty, malformed hands. Still bent in the most unnatural of positions.  
"Did you know? In 1990, a man named Stanley Meyer made the world's first hydrogen car engine. We killed him." It pointed it's "cigarette" towards the hood of my car. "The media called it, the "Water Fuel Cell", because it sounds insane. It's a mechanism, which supposedly made "water" into "fuel" for your car. Insane, is it not? Two parts hydrogen, the stuff we burnt to reach the moon, one part oxygen, necessary for any sort of burning reaction. Only a psych ward runaway would think you could fuel an engine with that. Only an idiot would think to turn the ocean into precious fuel.

Do you want to know how we killed him? March 20, 1998, Meyer has a diner with two prospective belgian investors. Not even ten minutes in, he runs out of the restaurant, screaming "I'VE BEEN POISONED, I'VE BEEN POOOISONED!!!!". It couldn't have been much clearer. The county coroner ruled it a cerebral anuerysm. The family pushed for a private autopsy, but was denied.

Last year, Honda, or Fiat, or- It's all the same really. Nowadays, every car manufacturer worth his salt has a hydrogen car in their stock. We killed Stanley Allen Meyer. We put poison into his pasta, and we called his brother a moron for suspecting as much"

It took one last poof of it's imaginary cigarette, and pretended to put it out against the hood of my truck.

"The only reason the Wright Brothers have flown, is because no one believed that they could."

The creature stretched it stlit-legs to the sides, as to not collide with my truck, and straightened out. I readily took the hint and sped out of there, my heart beating in my chest. One hand on the steering wheel, my package confined securely within the glove-box compartment, i reached for my burner and dialed "Swab".

"Boss, boss, boss! Pick up! It's serious- A-are you there?!"

\-Yep kid, what's the issue? I know you wouldn't call if it wasn't serious.

"I think- I might be being followed. I've met something that looked like a fed- except- it was really, really weird. Didn't look like a person, but it spoke. It told me about the water fuel cell, and missing people cases. What the FUCK was it?! Didn't try to arrest me or nothing, but i'm pretty sure it watched me pick up the package. I'm not being followed right now, i just-. Has this happened before? What do i do with the package?"

\-Again? Shit... Hang on- Uh-.  
I could faintly make out the noises of shuffling and an indistinct conversation somewhere off to the side.  
\-Alright. kid. Here's what you're gonna do. You drop the package off at the recycling bin, kebab joint northside of town. Got it? Then, you get your ass to the usual meeting spot. I'll explain everything there.

"Got it, got it-. Should i uh, do the thing? Break the burner?"

\-Might as well. See you there.  
With that, the call ended.

I drove to the local fast-food restaurant as per the instructions. I kept looking over my shoulder over and over, stuck in a frantic state of fight or flight. I managed to calm myself ever so slightly and try to appear inconspicous during the dropoff. I don't think the clerk bought it.

The creature seemed to be nowhere in sight. I suppose as ghastly and unnatural as it was, it couldn't have possibly been faster than a car.

Once the drop-off was complete, i promptly made my way to "Swab's" office, located out of a small storage unit on the other side of the city. Still ashook and paranoid, i knocked four times and awaited for the door to roll up.

Eventually, after a brief moment, it did.

\-Come on in, kid. - Said "Swab", as he waved me in into his tiny office.  
He sat by his little desk, unbothered as always in spite of the recent happenings.  
"I dropped it off as you've asked. W-what do we do now, boss?"  
\-Ah, sorry to tell ya this, but this is the end for "we". You're "burnt", kid, that \*thing\* is with the feds. I'll help ya out as much as i can, but after this meet you no longer work for me. Damn shame, is what it is, but what can ya do? In any case, kid-. You did good by me. Most important, you kept your wits around you when the creature shown up. Not the first time it happened. Hopefully the last.  
"W-what? You've dealt with that thing before?! And you didn't tell me?"  
\-You never were the inquisitive type, lad. I had hoped you wouldn't run into em'. Now, if you allow me, i'll tell you everything we do know, including what might keep you safe. Codeword; might.  
"Alright, boss. I'll uh- Are we safe right now? I don't think i was being followed but, that thing isn't exactly anything i had to deal with before."  
\-We should be. We don't know much about the thing, only ever seen it once before. The package we had you pick up, uhm- You don't wanna know what's in that box, but the only ever time we handled it before, same thing happened. No fault in our system. That thing just shows up whenever we deal with that type of a package. We had assumed it wouldn't happen twice in a row, but i suppose now we know better.

\-The lad who picked it up before you thought it was divine intervention, or rather, Satan coming to collect his dues. The lad wasn't as squeaky clean as you, had a few of em' good ol' skeletons in the closet. Personally? Don't think it's the devil, as weird as it is. Ekhem, anycase', let's speed this up. The thing shouldn't be around here, but it might be.

\-Story's simple as a whittled stick. Delivery lad picks up the stuff you don't wanna know 'bout, and then, he starts seeing shit. Immediately after, too. Keeps calling all his contacts, spewing out buncha schizophrenic garbage, right? Talkin' 'bout World's Fair, Pyramids- That one rock statue that centers on the North Star, sayin' it was built four thousand years ago, still points to the correct star, proves the Earth's axis don't change over the centuries, like that nonsense fuckin' matters-. Gah. Anyway, point' being, he hasn't bothered making the deposit. Soon as he saw the freak, he floored, all wild goose-chase'like, trying to hide around all over. Now, everyone knows he's "burnt", so no one wants him around. After all of his contacts told him to fuck off, he takes the hint and starts off towards the border, package still in hand. Day and a half after the initial pickup, we see on the news he commited suicide, three bulletholes in the back of his head, ninety-eight percent of his "epi-dermis" covered in third-degree chemical burns. No one contests the autopsy. or what-have-you. The family tries to poke'n'prod, right? Well, week after they request a private autopsy, the lad's father gets found with trafficking-quantity of cocaine. Beat to death by an aryan no less than a week after arriving in the genpop. See what i'm getting at?

\-Now, the good news is- As far as we can attest, he kept breathing as long as he did because he kept on the move. Evenin' of the second day of the drive, he gets too tired to keep drivin', rents a hotel room, and never leaves it. We assume the freak ain't faster than a speeding truck, or that there's a grace period. You ever hear 'bout "gangstalking"? Could be some nonsense like that, beats me. Oh, and, they never did recover the package, the cops i mean. Had a friend on the inside ask around about that. Maybe the freak's only after that? Maybe he'll stop chasin' you now that the box ain't on you.

\-In any case, here's what you're gonna do, boy. You earnt yerself a bonus for not running off into the into the wild pale yonder. The backpack in front of ye has ten thousand in it, you take it, and you floor it toward the border to keep safe, and you don't contact ANY of our lads for nothing, ever again. With some luck, the freak will lose the scent, prioritize the box, and i won't have to hear anymore bullshit about Ann Frank's ball-point pen, for God's sake, my grandma was in the camps! I think someone would've told me somethin' if that was a fib!

\-Ekhem- Anycase'.. It was pleasure doin' business with you, lad. Shame you did got burnt, i hope you make it, i really do. Your car shouldn't be in the system. The freak might be with the government, but it ain't anything in the official capacity.

"Swab" extended his hand towards me, and i shook it as firmly as i could. I grabbed the backpack he so graciously prepared, and then i turned around and left, never again to see perhaps the only man who has ever treated me with respect.

Before i could comply with his sagely learned advice i had to risk it all and go back to my apartment. I left my gun there, and i wasn't going to face whatever the hell that thing was without it.

I was already feeling exhausted after living through the initial adrenaline dump, and i had to exercise conscious effort to stay as paranoid as the circumstances warranted. It took me about twenty minutes to reach home. No sign of the freak all the way through, up until i entered the "safety" of my house.

It didn't register to me until after i had already entered, but my television was on, and it was blaring on louder than i had ever heard it play. It's volume matched only by the nonsensical nature of it's contents. They sounded like what the freak has spouted on about back at the dropoff site, and what "Swab" had mentioned second-hand. The freak must have been inside, waiting for me, and yet i had no other choice. I could not leave without my firearm. Worst case scenario, i'd have to shoot it right here and there.

As the television screamed at me about how: "IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FULLY GAUGE THE EFFECTS OF MICROPLASTICS ON THE POPULACE, BECAUSE THERE IS NO CONTROL GROUP UNTAINTED BY THEM TO COMPARE WITH." I bolted to the bedroom, wherein my gun was stashed, not stopping to consider the noise that was being spewn into the surroundings.

The firearm I bought legally, years ago. I forget what mark or make it was specifically. I only recall that it had an oddity about it. A trigger-based safety mechanism. The first shot out of a series required the user to exert much greater force on the trigger, such that it was practically impossible to discharge negligently, while leaving no risk of accidentally leaving the safety on during a life-threatening confrontation.

As i knelt down towards the cupboard where it was stashed, i could hear ever-more nonsense come from the living room. Bizzare sentences following one another without rhyme or reason. An unidentified official, in sob-like blurts of monologue painfully admitting to having sent soldiers into the Iraq conflict in forest-pattern bright green camo hoping they'd die, followed without a pause by the testimony of a researcher utmost entranced by the blood sacrifice traditions still practiced in the less-developed parts of Africa to this day. He chuckled as he mentioned female circumcision, and how it had been outlawed by the UN back in two-thousand and twelve.

It's still a legal practice in Russia to this day, or so i'm told. I grabbed my gun and two spare magazines. Now armed and ready, i crept towards the source of the nonsense-noise with a renewed sense of almost-safety. I expected the freak to be around, but i was certain i could fend him off this time. Perhaps this could be the last i've seen of him, maybe, just maybe.

I found him in front of my television, curled up in an embryo position, his neck extending up towards the television while his body lay there almost independently. To my surprise, the television was not displaying any images in pair to the audio. Instead it showed the phonetic writing for each word spoken. The freak was mouthing them out with a blissful smile on his facismile of a face, child-like wonder radiating off of him as he did so.

A thought sparked in my mind that he may be more creature than man, and i discharged two shots into his curled up massive frame. The trigger gave way far too easily, and my ears rang painfully. The freak was stopped dead in his tracks midway through a fascinating lecture on fiat currency. Without much fanfare, he slowly and calmly got up, blood seeping through the bullet-holes in his chest. Now fully distended he was far too big to fit in my dingy apartment. His bloated back was strained against the ceiling, his kness bending in ways unconceivable toward the floor, and his neck stretched in a fashion most worm-like.

Eventually his face devoid of the whatever it is that makes people seem "human", has opened up. The stench of freshly-printed paper oozed out as he spoke in his distressingly calm tone:

"Many of the wonders of early World's Fair exhibits have mysteriously burnt down. Treasures of the brightest minds of our civillization lost to the flames forever. Beloved works which served to decorate the very reality they existed in. During a World's Fair in Chicago in 1893 they burnt down the "Greatest Refrigerator on Earth". They like to joke around like this, you know. Many of the structures were not burnt, but not allowed stand after the fair's conclusion and were dismantled. The greatest of them hadn't survived even in photographs. They have made sure of it."

I discharged three more times, hitting the freak's disjointed head twice and sending a stray round into his arm. He was initially pushed back by the sheer force of the impact, but none of it seemed to make a lasting impression on his unnatural body.

"The Eiffel Tower was built by one hundred and fifty proles. A hundred and fifty. That's all it takes to make a world's wonder. As of today, the population has exceeded nine billion, and yet, no new wonders have been made since the previous millenium. No one liked the Eiffel Tower when it was first built in 1889. Many have complained of it's unsightly nature, the pollution of natural "view". Many more petitioned to have it dismantled after the World's Fair concluded. No one liked it, that's why it survived, you see."

The freak reached his thin arm towards my face with a surprising gusto for a "man" who had just been shot five times. I decided to run away. Bullets clearly had no impact on him. I was only spared by the fact that he loved to ramble on about conspiratorial factoids. I began to cautiously retreat towards the exist, still aiming my gun at the uniform-clad creature. The freak followed me at a pace just a little slower than my own, always in the view, not letting me get any breathing room.

I bumped into the exit door with my back. By my count i've had another five bullets left. I planned to discharge all of them into the "fed", rush towards my vehicle and do as i was told. The entire detour turned out to be nothing but a big mistake. My heart skipped a bit as, i frantically pulled the trigger once, then the second time, a third, and then, the last. I realized why the trigger-safety hadn't been engaged. Of course- I was such a moron-. The creature had been in my house before i arrived. It did something to the gun- or the ammunition.

And yet, it was "hurt" by every round i hit it with. The blood was seeping through it's uniform even now. So what was the point? Had he snuck into my house just to- What, shoot my gun, once? As if to mock me for even thinking it could be hurt.

All four of my remaining rounds hit the center mass perfectly, a grouping to be proud of. It did nothing. The unnatural, and ghastly being stood as unbothered as it always had been. Sweating profusely and deeply ashook i desperately tried to rush through the doors and towards my car.

I managed to rush through and shut the door behind me as swiftly as my state of utter panic allowed me to. In perfect sync with me, the creature pushed it's head through doors, old wood giving way and splintering as it pushed onward. This time it didn't say anything. It just stared at me as i ran down the staircase tripping over myself.

I've been driving for twelve hours now, steadily closing in on the border. No sign of the freak, much like any other time i've driven. I'm as calm as the circumstance will permit, but the things it said have been bugging me. I've heard about some of it previously, mostly when talking with conspiracy nutjobs, and genuine crackheads.

No matter how hard i reflected upon it's tales of World's Fair, the man named Stanley Meyer, and it's apparent hatred of circumcision, i couldn't make any sense of it. Was it implying that i had found myself amidst a conspiracy? Was i to be discussed for years to come, by the mentally ill and the drug-addled long after i had been dealt with? I thought back on the first time i've met it, back in the woods.

If there was a theme to be had with it's ramblings, it's that there was some sort of a- mechanism, or a conspiracy, meant to stop those who raise above. That didn't make much sense either. I wasn't special, i didn't raise above, and no sane person would think me capable of of invoking change into the world. I'm no Stanley Meyer, or a Wright brother. I was a low-level operator, a city-scale drugmule, a man who has played it far too safe to work his way up, even in the world of crime, and now, i was a runaway. Why was this happening to me?

In the end, i concluded that much like the missing bullet from earlier, this was nothing but an intimidation tactic. The question is, what for? Did this freak even have intentions? Coherent plans, and an end-goal in mind?

I set those thoughts aside as i glanced at my fuel gauge. I was running on fumes, the gas in the tank was running out, too. I'd have to pull over sooner than later. As irrational as it was, i still feared that impossible schizophrenic creature would appear wherever it is i stopped.

Knowing well this could be a fatal mistake, i switched lanes, and began to near the gas station. The plan was to just get my tank filled up, as fast as i could, and then make my way out of there. I rationalized that the creature couldn't have possibly travelled over seven hundred miles in the span of a dozen hours. I checked my remaining ammunition to make sure it hadn't been messed with, and ready to be used, for all the good that would do, anyway. Then i pulled over.

By the time my car came to a halt next to the gasoline dispenser, i had almost convinced myself to relax. I got out, took a brief moment to stretch out my legs, now numb from the long drive, and immediately after scoured the area.

No one around. Naught. The place was deserted. Must've been the late hour, but the emptiness of the parking lot only added to the latent paranoia. I must've spent something like, ten, fifteen minutes keeping a watchful eye out for my elongated stalker. He was nowhere in sight. At that point i had realized that i didn't have enough gas in the tank to reach the next station over. It was pointless to make haste. This would be either my last stop before the border, or my last stand.

With that realization, came a sort of calm. The freak wasn't here. He couldn't be here, because if he were, what could i possibly do? He mustn't be here.

I began to feel stupid for ever thinking otherwise. He couldn't fit into a car, he couldn't travel as fast as mine did. I was safe.

Reinvogirated by these thoughts, i've made my way to the register, and allowed myself to pick up some snacks and drinks for the way. I've spent the last half nychtemeron parched and hungry. I wasn't greedy enough to go for a real meal, but i've opted to use the lavatories. Pissing in a bottle can only get you so far.

I've dropped off the snacks at the car, snuck a few rapid glances off to the wayside, just to make sure, and headed on into the bathroom, ready to drop off some weight.

There, at the back of the dingy gas staton, stood the blue bathroom doors, illuminated only by the castaway light straying off of the streetlamps not meant for them. The Final Stand, The Crossing of The Rubicon, The Turn of The Millenia, The Breaking Down of The Berlin Wall, The Trinity Test Detonation with the power of twenty kilotons, and, lastly, which i didn't know at the time, The Place Where I Would Die.

I entered, and as soon as i was a nanometer behind the doorway, i knew that was it. I didn't see the freak there, what i saw instead, was his mouth. It stretched to fully cover the dimensions of the bathroom, down to the atom. From floor to the ceiling. The gaping maw the width, and height of the walls, inching ever so closer. No more forbidden truths to share, no more threats, no more nonsense, just death, the size it shouldn't be.

In the time it took me to turn around, i was fully enveloped. The exit nowhere in sight, darkness everywhere it could possibly be.  
I reached for my gun, knowing full well there was no use in what i was about to do. The trigger gave way easily, and nine shots rang out, just as i knew they would. What brief flashes of light they provided, none of it was any use. I couldn't see the back of it's "throat" anymore, neither the walls nor the ceiling. My ears didn't hurt as much as they should. I wasn't in the bathroom anymore. The "floor" beneath my feet became wet. not with blood, but saliva. Then, it spoke again.

"In school, have they taught you of bounty hunters? The pinnacle of World War Two. Human nature laid bare. At the height of the genocide of the izraelites, some of them looked at their brethren, not with empathy, not with pity, not even with remorse, and as they gazed, they knew just how to survive.

National socialists allowed some of them to live, and earn a considerable wage, by pretending to be death camp runaways. They would arrive into a small town, looking discheveled, begging for shelter. Some of them have even starved themselves in preparation, to appear more believeable. They would often find shelter. No later than a week after, their guardian angels would be on a train, heading nowhere in particular. They survived the war, just as rats and roaches did. There is strenght in filth."

At this point i've had enough. I keeled over and screamed. I couldn't understand what was happening, and why. I was a broken man awaiting to be corpse.

"Any man can be a rat. To be clean is a privilege, after all."

\-WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT FROM ME?! ENOUGH WITH THIS NONSENSE- JUST KILL ME ALREADY- YOU PIECE OF--

"Calm yourself. You are in polite company after all."

"We would like you to testify against Bernard Hoffman, your former employer, streetname "Swab". Will you become a rat, and live?"

There was once a man who prided himself on following the rules, never stepping on anyone's toes, and lacking in greed. The man applied these principles even in crime. One day, he picked up his last package. The contents aren't important, even though it was what lead to the man's death. He was a clean rat, and so, could be eaten. His body would be later discovered with nine gunshot wounds to the back of the head, in a dingy gas station bathroom an hour away from the border. It would be ruled a suicide. None of his family cared enough to contest, and so, they lived.

His killer, a being which shouldn't be, would write down the last of his thoughts, and post them here.
