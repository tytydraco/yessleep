My sister's screams were raw.  Primal.  They shredded the fabric of the peaceful summer's afternoon, leaving it hanging in bloody tatters.

She had discovered her beloved cat, Misty, lying dead in the back yard.  The three-year-old Russian Blue had been torn open from throat to groin, her flesh butterflied apart to expose the things inside of her that were never meant to see the light of day.  Her wet organs glistened in the sun, the deep purplish-red of plums; her exposed ribs and pelvis gleamed through the mess of viscera, the bright white of teeth set inside a deranged grin.  Her slate-coloured fur was dark and heavy with blood, as was the grass beneath her.

Misty's emerald eyes bulged, her pink tongue poking limply out of a mouth open in what appeared to be a silent scream.  But the worst part was the chewed-up remains of what would have been her kittens.  You see, Misty was pregnant at the time of her death.  Four tiny cat fetuses were scattered nearby, looking more like lumps of raw steak than anything that would have grown into living, breathing creatures.

The culprit?  Tucker, our six-year-old tan-and-white Jack Russell terrier.  He sat on his haunches, his muzzle and front paws painted crimson with Misty's blood.  There was a sickening gleam in his dark eyes as he watched Cora drop to her knees next to Misty.  She took the mangled body in her arms and cradled it to her chest, sobbing all the while.

It seemed unbelievable that a dog could fillet a cat like that; it looked more like the work of a butcher who moonlighted as a serial cat killer.  But I knew it had been Tucker because Misty was far from the first creature he had killed and mutilated in a spectacularly gruesome manner.  Almost from the day we brought Tucker home as a puppy, animals would turn up gruesomely murdered on our property.  It started out small, most of the victims being squirrels or birds, but as Tucker grew, he began targeting cats and even other dogs.  Fellow pet-owners in the neighbourhood were terrified of him.  Mum, of course, refused to believe that Tucker was the culprit.  She refused to believe that her precious pup was anything but a darling little angel, despite a staggering amount of evidence to the contrary.

As I stood on the lawn that terrible afternoon, watching Tucker watch Cora cry over Misty with that terrible look in his eye, I knew with a heavy certainty that not even the brutal slaughter of Misty would make Mum see the light.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was correct.

Mum was furious at Cora for touching Misty's body and getting blood on her hands and clothes... blood that was inevitably tracked inside the house.  And she \*really\* hit the roof when she learned that Cora had wrapped Misty's body in a hand towel, placed the bundle inside a shoebox, and brought it inside.

"Get in the shower and wash that mess off! \*Now\*! Don't even \*think\* about getting out until you're completely clean! If you do, I'll toss you back in and scrub you until your skin is red and raw!"

While Cora was showering, Mum grabbed a plastic compost bag and dumped Misty in it.  She then went outside, collected the dead kittens, and put them in there too.  She climbed into her car, bag in hand, and drove away.  The bag was gone when she returned a half hour later, and she wouldn't say where she'd been or what she'd done with the remains.

When Cora found out, she flew into a rage unlike anything I had ever seen before.  She broke glasses, kicked over furniture, and attacked Mum, scratching her face and arms and pulling her hair.  Dad and I were barely able to restrain her.  Mum was completely unsympathetic to Cora and her grief over the loss of Misty, even going so far as to say that Misty had probably attacked Tucker and that the dog had only been acting in self-defence.

"Besides," she added coldly, "you know I never wanted you to have a cat in the first place.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A week passed, during which Cora's hatred of Tucker grew out of control, a raging wildfire hell-bent on incinerating everything in its path.  She would scream obscenities and throw things at Tucker; sometimes she would even kick and hit him.  "I'm going to kill you, you vile little shit," she hissed.  "Just you wait!"

I had no doubt in my mind that she meant it.

One evening, Mum decided that Tucker seemed restless and ordered Cora to take him for a walk.  Much to everyone's surprise, Cora didn't protest.  She simply smiled and nodded, then stood up from the couch and went to leash Tucker up.

After a moment, I stood up too.  "Cora, wait! I'm coming with you."

Cora was oddly calm as we left the house.  Normally, when she had to walk Tucker, she'd be snarling all the way, jerking Tucker around violently and pulling on the leash until he began to choke from his collar tightening around his neck.  But she did none of that on this particular evening, which deeply unnerved me.

Not far into the walk, she took a turn away from our normal route and began heading in the direction of a major road that was busy at all hours of the day.

"Cora, where are we going?" I asked.  She ignored me.

When we reached the busy intersection, Cora stopped.  She reached inside the pocket of her baggy jeans and pulled out a worn tennis ball.

Then she bent down and unclipped Tucker's leash.

"Cora," I gasped.

Her blue eyes scorched into my brown ones.  They blazed with a white-hot rage that had me not wanting to draw any nearer for fear of getting burned.

\*Try to stop me,\* she seemed to say.  \*I fucking DARE you.\*

I hesitated.

Barely.

Then I gave a single grim, silent nod.

Cora tossed the ball into traffic.  "Fetch, boy!"

Tucker took off.

He made no sound as the wheels of a truck bore down on his back, flattening him instantly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mum was devastated.

Cora, Dad, and I were relieved.  So were our neighbours.  With Tucker gone, nobody had to worry about their pets being massacred.

I didn't regret what we had done.  Neither did Cora.  Tucker was an evil creature who had caused us nothing but misery and grief over the previous six years.  He had killed so many beloved pets, brought so much heartache upon their owners.  He had brought out the worst in our mother, turning her into a crazy bitch who loved her dog more than her husband and children.  How could we \*not\* be certain what we had done the right thing, even if it was wicked?

An eye for an eye, as they say.  And it doesn't \*always\* make the world go blind.

At least, that was what I hoped.

But then Tucker returned.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I awoke one night to a commotion from downstairs.  Mum's voice, high-pitched and almost manic, yelling, "He's back! He's back!"  Dad begging her to come back to bed with him.  Cora screaming, "He \*can't\* be back! Micah and I \*watched\* him die!"

I ran downstairs and found my family crowded around the front door.  The lights were on and Mum's eyes were wide and unblinking, her lips stretched into an unnerving grin.  "Micah! Micah, Tucker's back! It's a miracle!"

"He's \*not\* back, Micah!" Cora yelled.  "Mum's just being delusional."

"He \*is\* back!" Mum insisted.  "I heard him bark! He's just outside the door! I have to let him in!"

"Jenny, no!"  Dad grabbed her arm, but she wrenched it away.  "Honey, please. Tucker's \*dead.\* A dead dog doesn't come back to life!"

"Tucker is no ordinary dog! Tucker is \*special\*!"  Mum's grin grew even wider; I could see every tooth.  She looked deranged, barely even human.  "He's back!"

"Jesus," I muttered, backing away from her.

Then, from outside, came a sharp sound.  That high-pitched, piercing bark that stabbed at your eardrums like an icepick.  That none of us had ever thought we'd have to hear again.

Tucker.

Mum reached for the knob.

"Mum, no!" I yelled, but she had already flung the door open.

Sitting on the front porch, the moon shining on him like a spotlight, was Tucker.  At least, what had once \*been\* Tucker.  The sight was so gruesome I couldn't even process it as a whole picture; just snapshots, fragments of gory details.  Broken, mangled teeth puncturing rotting lips.  A head like a half-deflated balloon.  An eye hanging from its socket by the thin white noodle of the optic nerve.  Swaths of flesh torn from the back and sides, exposing the bony white knobs of the spine, the xylophone of the ribcage.  Legs bent like a crab's.

Mum began to scream.

Cora surged forward, fireplace poker in hand.  She loomed over Tucker and raised her weapon high above her head.

"I'm sending you back to hell where you belong!" she screamed.

Tucker leapt up at her, clamping his misshapen jaws around her throat.  With one violent jerk of his head, he tore open her jugular, sending blood spraying across the wall.

Cora went down, writhing on the floor, her mouth open in a voiceless gasp as she clutched at the gaping wound in her neck.  Those blue eyes that had burned with so much anger on the evening we killed Tucker were wide and glassy with shock and fear.  It felt like an agonizingly long time that we watched her struggle, all of us frozen, knowing there was nothing we could do to save her... but it was likely only a minute, maybe even less, before she went still.

Tucker dipped his head and began lapping the blood from her neck, as if he were drinking from his water bowl.  Dad, roaring, snatched up the fallen fire poker and brought it down hard on Tucker's exposed spine.  It broke with the sound of a rifle being fired, that ear-splitting \*crack\* that seemed to split the air in two.  Tucker let out a howl that chilled me all the way down to my bone marrow.

But he didn't die.

Somehow, using only his front legs (the back ones were now useless, dangling like a broken puppet's) he launched himself at Dad and tore out \*his\* throat, just like he had done to Cora.  Dad, too, bled out within seconds.

You'd think Mum would be screaming.  You'd think she'd be hysterical, watching her zombie dog slaughter her daughter and husband.  But she just stood there, grey as a corpse, swaying on her feet as if the floor beneath her were bucking and roiling like ocean waves.  Maybe she was in shock.

"Mum!" I yelled.  "Mum, call the police!"

She looked at me.  Then she looked at Tucker, who was now licking up Dad's blood with a fervent hunger.

"I'm not leaving him," she said.  "Not when I just got him back."

"Mum, what are you..."

"Get out, Micah," she said.

"No!"

"\*Get out\*!" she screamed, grabbing me by the collar of my T-shirt and throwing me out the open door.  How she managed it, I do not know; at six feet tall, I loomed over her petite 5'2" frame and outweighed her by at \*least\* one hundred pounds.  Perhaps her desperation \*not\* to be separated from her beloved Tucker once again gave her a superhuman strength.  Like a mother lifting a car off of her toddler.

The door slammed, and I threw myself against it, screaming, pounding.  Sirens wailed somewhere up the street; the police.  Someone must have heard the commotion and alerted them.

"Mum!" I yelled.  "\*Mum\*!"

A police cruiser pulled into our driveway, siren still blaring, red and blue lights flashing against the night sky, just as Mum began to scream.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

That was three days ago.

Mum, Dad, and Cora were all pronounced dead at the scene.  Tucker was nowhere to be found.

I told the police that an intruder had broken in, killed my family, and thrown me out of the house when I tried to fight them.  I hated lying to law enforcement, but how the hell could I tell them that our dog had come back from the dead?  They would think I was crazy.  They might even suspect \*me\* of being the culprit.

Maybe they already do.

I have been staying with my paternal grandparents.  As grateful as I am to them for taking me in, I fear that me being under their roof puts them at risk.

You see, I believe that Tucker will come back.  Evil like that doesn't die easily.  And he didn't get to finish the job; to seek his revenge.  To avenge his own death.

He will come back with the intent to kill me.  Then he will kill my grandparents.  I have to be prepared.

Which is why I write this by moonlight, instead of getting some much-needed sleep, a serrated hunting knife tucked under my pillow.  I don't know if it would save me, but I have to \*try.\* I can't just stand there doing nothing like on the night my parents and sister were killed.

Wait.

I think I just heard a bark.
