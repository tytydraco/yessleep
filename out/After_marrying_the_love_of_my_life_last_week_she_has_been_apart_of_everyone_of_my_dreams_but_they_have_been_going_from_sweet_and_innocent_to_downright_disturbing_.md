Liah… my beautiful and precious sweet Liah. Meeting her in high school, Senior year, was straight up magical!

Being high school sweethearts was a stereotype that everyone at the school would think. And when Liah and I started going out, my friends and her friends would always have second thoughts about it. EVEN MY PARENTS WOULD TOO! 

But I wouldn’t let peoples opinions get in the way of really matters… TRUE LOVE!

I will never forget that moment, last month, when I got down on one knee out on the meadow. It was a nice calm and cool Octobers night. The stars shimmering in the sky. Our favourite activity together was stargazing and holding each other. Her being in my arms resting her head on my chest, and me stroking her hair, oh it’s just simply… an unexplained FEELING REALLY! 

Grabbing a ring from out of my pocket, my birthstone, a ruby ring. Plated with gold around it. This was the moment when I would say those famous four words, “Will you marry me?” 

Waiting in anticipation and little anxiety, I was relieved when I heard the simple words, “Yea my dear.” 

Getting up and kissing her in that moment was just simply… magical! A moment I will never forget till the time I pass away and go. 

Anyways, our wedding was just last week since it takes a little bit of time to plan such a big event. So while we were engaged for a couple weeks after my ground breaking proposal, we both researched affordable but romantic places to have a wedding.

We ended up deciding on going to an outdoor pond. A land owned by my aunt. Obviously we paid for the food and other stuff involved with the event. But having it at my aunts, really helped with cutting the cost of such a big thing. 

Anyways, we said our vows… blah, blah, blah… 

AND BAHM! *OFFICIALLY MARRIED HUSBAND AND WIFE*

It flashed before my eyes really but will always be with me. 

So now we are planning a honey moon to Alaska since it has been a week since we got married, but ever since the wedding, my dreams have been… LETS JUST SAY… 


STRANGE!!!

When we were engaged after my proposal, the dreams were just absolutely amazing! I mean literally heavenly. 

Seeing her and I kissing and hugging each other while the clouds turned into hearts and the sky turned a bright pink is something straight out of a movie, and of course since it was a dream, it was possible! 

Other times I would dream about her wearing a beautiful bright red dress, her hair looking prettier than ever and her smile, oh her smile, lightning up my heart from inside. 

Even on little naps that I would take, I would dream about her. Amazing dreams, downright, AMAZING dreams. Like having one of her and I on a ferris wheel together during the Fourth of July, watching the fireworks shoot out and explode in the sky, while her head is on my shoulder and hands are interlocked. Such a comforting and cozy feeling I had. 

And after such dreams, I would always, every single time, wake up with this amazing feeling and be so happy. Giving this optimistic feeling to this big step of life called… Marriage.

Don’t get me wrong, I would have dreams about Liah time to time when we were dating, but after the proposal and her saying yes and us being engaged, they have been basically coming in every night. 

For more context about our relationship, we have been dating for 5 years and now married, so a long time. 

So for the dreams to increase more about her than when we were dating really puts into perspective how powerful such a thing did to me. 

Unless something else was happening…


U see, after we got married… the dreams have turned into nightmares. 


This has spooked me because we haven’t fought at all in the last month after the engagement and wedding and everything has been fine. 

It went from being engaged and having amazing dreams to being married and having nightmares, just like that… in the snap of a finger! 

The first time I had one of these nightmares was actually the day after the wedding. It was night time. The typical cuddling and kissing was going on with me and Liah. But it was a different feeling since we had just gotten married, a very exciting and happy feeling. 

Dozing into sleep thinking about how I am gonna spend my entire life with this dream girl, I slip into the world of dreaming. 

There she is. Liah! We are climbing a mountain together. But then all of a sudden, her face starts to freeze up. Her eyes have cracks in them and she is staring at me… then she lets out a disturbing scream, a scream of pure agony and excruciating pain!

Waking up with fear and a gasping breath, it is morning time and what felt like a couple minutes, actually ended up being hours, because you know that’s how dreams be. 

The second nightmare was actually terrifying. 

It was two days after that first one and it was about Liah and me going out for some coffee. Everything was fine, her and I talking about things. Than all of a sudden. A masked robber comes in shouting at everyone to give him some money! He goes around the table to everyone but stops at Liah. And he…

PULLS THE TRIGGER! 

It was disturbing…

Seeing the love of my life, die…

I weeped in pain as I woke up in fear. Liah at my side shushing me and telling me that it’s ok. I was too embarrassed to tell her what I had seen in my nightmare and I didn’t want her to fear that it was me thinking the marriage isn’t right because of how dreams can link up to emotions, which simply wouldn’t even be right! 

The most recent nightmare I had was last night before I am typing this. 

It started out with Liah walking around in my backyard. She said, “I’m gonna plant some veggies in the garden.” 

“Ok honey!” I replied.

I smelt something while I replied this. It was so vivid even while being in a dream. 

It was underneath the ground in which I was standing. 

I reached with my hands and digged up the dirt to see what the smell was. 

I gasped in horror when I saw a human body sticking out of the dirt. 

This was when I woke up in shock and fear again. Liah by my side saying, “These damn nightmares, do you wanna maybe get a counselor or talk to your doctor about what could be causing them. I know that marriage is stressful so maybe that could be why. It is a very big step after all.”

I replied, “I’m fine honey. Really.”

This is when Liah replied with, “oh you sure honey.” In a demonic voice.

“You ok?” I exclaimed with a shaky tone in my speaking. 

“Oh yea, just think you should really see the doctor since I’m about to fucking slit your throat open!” She screamed out while holding a knife in her hand. 

She started to shriek a deafening sound and started slashing at my neck. 

This is when I fucking woke up again!!!!!

*IT WAS A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM!!!* I said to myself in my head in fear but also facisnation. 

“What the hell is going on? Something is going on?”

Honey!! U here?” I exclaimed. 

*no response*

“Liah, sweetheart. My flower, my love of my life. U ok?”

*again no response*

Walking out in confusion to look for her I noticed she was gone since her car was not in the driveway. Her car is a blue Honda with a visible scratch at the side of the drivers door. 

Texting her and asking where she is, I sat down and turned on the tv, to help calm my nerves down. 

*Let’s try the news, shall we?* I said to myself in my head. 

“This just in, teen boy has been kidnapped by what witnesses describe a woman wearing a gown. Here is a picture of their vehicle.”

The car in the picture… 

WAS A BLUE HONDA! With a fucking scratch mark on the side, seen on the cctv surveillance video. 

I smacked myself in the face to make sure I was dreaming. But no, I felt the sting clear as day across my left cheek. 

Save to say, 

This divorce is gonna be…

FUCKING GOLDEN!!!!!!
