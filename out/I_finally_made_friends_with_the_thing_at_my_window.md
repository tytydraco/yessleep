There's no people left in my town. Just me. Me and it. 

It comes to my window, but only at night. Every day, I wait for the sun to go down, so when it comes, we can talk.

Well, I talk to it. It never really talks back, just moves it's jaw up and down and opens it's mouth. I think it's trying to learn our language. Even though it doesn't understand me, it always shows up every night. 

At first I was afraid of it. It's a bit jarring and unpleasant to look at, even if that sounds a bit mean. The first time I caught it out of the corner of my eye I felt my heart stop for a moment.

It's eyes are sunk and hollow. It has just raggedy patches of hair, and skin that looks like it hangs from the cheekbones. It's a stark, pale, pale white, and red splotches cover the exposed skin. Rags hang from it's thin frame of a body, and it looks like it's in pain. It moves stiffly, with short jerky motions. I want to help it, but I think it's scared of me. I suppose I don't look much better to it. 

I've tried to go outside, to at least meet it. It's been so long since I talked to a person. Since I shook someone's hand. Since I gave someone a hug. I tried to meet it, but when I got outside, it was gone. It was hard getting back inside that day. It feels like my body is filled with sand sometimes.

I tried to leave food out for it. I don't have much in the way of food anymore, but I like canned chilli, so I figured maybe it would, too. The chilli remained untouched on the doorstep for three days. I wasn't offended, though. Not everyone likes chilli.

I wish I could invite it inside, it's cold out there. It's cold inside, too, but at least there's less wind. The bombs fell a ways away from my house, but the shockwave tore off part of my roof. I'd patch it if I wasn't so tired. 

A particularly strong gust blows through my house now. It's so cold. Before the bombs, I heard a man on the news talking about "nuclear winter", and I guess this is it. It's okay though, the sun is setting. It will be here any minute now. 

The sky finally turns dark, and I make my way to the window. I peer into the night, press my face against the glass. I don't see it. Where is it? My already labored breathing becomes quicker with panic. 

Have I done something to offend it? Will it ever come back? Am I all alone now? 

My breath fogs the glass, and I frantically, sloppily wipe the glass with what's left of my sleeve. I take a step back, squint my eyes. Pray.

Oh. There it is.  Thank God.

I smile. It smiles. We have finally become friends I think.

The eyes look so familiar.
