**Aerophobia**

Journal Entry of Jared Phillips

Bermuda Triangle

July 19th, 1985

It’s been two days since it all started. Everyone is missing. I found this journal lying on the floor of this claustrophobic nightmare and decided to document our harrowing ordeal in this hellscape. So far, it’s just me and two others—Germane and Yousef.  We were originally booked on a flight from Miami to San Juan, but midway through, we saw a deep purple mist outside the windows. The mist soon infiltrated the plane, enveloping us in this mortifying gas. That’s the last thing any of us remember before everything went dark.  Now, we find ourselves trapped on this plane, which is eerily stationary in the sky at around 35,000 feet. Strangely, the aircraft seems to be in perfect condition, aside from some metal plates that are crushed and broken. Despite the plane’s apparent operational state, all communication systems are down, and we have no way to reach emergency services.  The persistent gas outside might be responsible for the malfunctioning communications, adding to our isolation. To sustain ourselves, we’ve been relying on prepackaged airline food—sandwiches and salads—hoping they’ll spoil quickly and force us to deal with the reality of our situation sooner rather than later.  So far, nothing too extraordinary has happened, but the atmosphere is growing increasingly unsettling. I’ll continue to update this journal in case anything changes.

As I mentioned previously, something interesting has occurred. Trying to entertain ourselves, we found a rotting carcass. It shook us all with complete terror. We ran back as soon as we saw it. The corpse was surreal. The stench soon filled the airways of the plane, and the foul odor instantly made me and the others puke. I noticed something odd about the corpse, however. It was already midway through the rotting process. Considering what I’ve learned in school, corpses, let alone human ones, don’t just rot in a span of three days. It was as if being in the plane was transcending time itself to speed up the process. Noticing this, I braved the stench and headed towards our food pile. The sandwiches and other prepackaged foods that we had feasted upon had become moldy and rotten. I brought this up to the other two, and they were in the same disbelief as I was. This means we have to act fast if we want to escape this nightmare. We all considered switching our food source to prepackaged snacks to sustain ourselves. I only hope we can find a way to reach the outside world.

Our food rations continue to fall short. I’m starting to think Yousef has been pigging out on the food while Germane and I haven’t been looking. We planned to have a consistent amount of food to last us at least three more days; however, I’ve noticed the amount of food has been diminishing more quickly than expected. I’ve talked to Germane about this, and we both believe that Yousef is behind it. We think he ate more while we were searching for a way out. If this continues, we’re going to have to start indulging in the rotten and spoiled meals scattered throughout.

The worst has come to fruition. Due to Yousef’s continued habits, we’ve had to sustain ourselves with rotten meals. I was the first to brave such an abhorrent practice. I took a deep breath and quickly bit into a piece of the heart-wrenching meal. I nearly threw up but managed to swallow it in time. The others followed suit. Germane and I are starting to develop true malice towards Yousef. It’s his fault, after all. If he hadn’t been selfish and eaten all the previous rations, we might have had more resources and could have put more effort into something productive, like searching for a way out. From now on, I’m going to have to put my foot down when it comes to food.

While sleeping yesterday a noise persisted.  The noise was reminiscent of a growling tap.  It kept me up all night.  I spoke to the others about it.  They said they heard no such thing.  Luckily we managed to find an assortment of canned foods in a cabinet near the staff kitchen.  Due to us not having any good utensils to open the cans we had to resort to continuously slamming the cans on the ground till an opening emerged then proceeding to pry a larger opening with our fingernails.  Speaking of our fingernails, our hygiene hasn’t been the greatest.  We smell as if we came straight out of a pig pen.  We had used all of the toothpaste and cleaning supplies on the plane.  There isn’t much keeping us going anymore.  I’m not sure if we're going to make it out of this alive.

The stench that the plane is giving off is revolting now.  I could bear it during the first week.  But now its gotten so bad.  It must be that corpse we found last week.  We tried to maintain the carcass by containing it in the very back of the plane.  Due to the rapid flow of time around the vicinity, it must be in the final process of decay.  As I expected Yousef was back doing what he’s best at, wasting all of our rations for his own selfish needs.  Me and Germane have stated that if he were to continue doing this we would have to hide the food from him.  I’m not sure if that will fully solve the problem but it’s worth a shot.  The noises that I’ve been hearing at night have gotten worse.  It’s gotten louder.  I woke up Germane about it last night and have spoken to him about it privately.  However, he continues to say that he cannot hear anything.  I don’t know what's going on.  It might be in my head.  I hope this stops soon.

It’s becoming increasingly worse now.  The noises have gotten even louder.  I can’t sleep at night anymore.  Along with the disgusting odor that has persisted throughout our stay its completely deprived me of a basic necessity.  I persist that the noises are not just in my head.  It might just be a side effect of something that I don’t know of.  On good news, the food slob, Yousef, hasn’t been stealing any food while we do other tasks.  I’ve been carefully counting all the cans of food daily now.  I hope he keeps this up.  It's better to starve for a moment than die of starvation.

The noises.  It's irritating beyond anyone’s comprehension now.  I can’t even hear my own thoughts at night anymore.  I leave my daily tasks to Germane now.  Half my day goes to sleeping now due to this persisting ruckus.  It’s like I’m becoming nocturnal.  And it’s been getting worse too.  Germane when counting the amount of cans today counted 3 short.  He scolded Yousef to stop this.  However, this time instead of Yousef apologetically trying to defend himself, he claimed he did no such thing.  We both doubted him.  Germane said he hid the food in a safer spot.  We only got 15 cans left.  If we keep using the supply, we’ll have to resort to eating the moldy sandwiches again.  I can’t think about those things without gagging.  I hope someone saves us soon.

I can’t stand it anymore.  The noises have not only completely gotten rid of my sleep.  It has managed to persist during the day now.  My head hurts.  I’ve given up telling the others as I don’t think it would benefit me anymore.  As I’m writing this I continue to hear the same noises.  We’ve had to resort to eating the disgusting slop sandwiches as before.  Yousef has stopped eating as he can’t stomach them anymore.  Good riddance to him.  He’s the only reason were in this food crisis to begin with.  A couple days ago the cans decreased rapidly.  He must’ve found the stash and ate it all.  If I’m being honest I hope that cow dies of starvation.  I’m here to survive.  Not die to his wrongdoings.  I will do whatever it takes to stay alive.

August 6th, 1985

Last night while walking around to try to minimize the noises, I found something in the back of the plane.  In the spot where the corpse laid, there was a glowing fruit.  Its aura was purplish and demonic.  The fruit.  It was calling to me.  I couldn’t help myself.  I was starving.  The fruit tasted incredible.  It was like a gourmet meal.  Best of all, it completely muted the noises.  It was incredible.  I’ve never been so happy in my life.  I haven’t told the others about it.  Maybe this is how Yousef feels when he’s eating the food supply without us knowing.  The fruit completely contained my hunger.  For once in this godforsaken stay I’ve felt at ease.  I didn’t even need to eat today.  I’m not sure how long the effects of the fruit will last.  I need to find a way out fast.

Bermuda Triangle

August 7th, 1985

While walking around at night.  I saw it.  The reason we were all in this mess.  The person behind it all.  Actually I’m not sure it was a person at all.  It resembled something out of this planet.  It was situated around the back of the plane in the exact spot where I had found the mysterious fruit prior.  It stood at 9 feet tall hunched over its hind legs due to the height of the plane ceiling not being suitable for its size.  It had no face.  No eyes.  No Mouth.  Just a glowing white mist surrounding it.  I was beyond baffled.  I couldn’t even react, scream, or do anything of that magnitude.  Most disturbingly, it spoke.  “Freedom may be obtained through the death of those around you.”  It said in a menacing tone.  I knew what I had to do.  I must kill Germane and Yousef.  It’s my ticket out of here.

I did it.  I killed them.  I did what he asked.  Yet I still remain here.  What did I do wrong?  Did he want me to make them suffer before their last seconds on this planet?  In the nights that they unknowingly slept, I had created a weapon.  I had sharpened a metal pole that was fastened to the walls of the airplane.  I started off with Yousef while he was sleeping.  Surprisingly I couldn’t feel a thing when I struck him.  Germane followed.  He woke up before I could strike him.  He tried fighting back.  But I overpowered him.  I only pray that it saves me.

*The journal entries you have just read have been in the studies by the FBI.  Aircraft 9874 was found located 3000 feet under the ocean 17 miles away from the coast of Puerto Rico.  The plane had no signs of damage or infiltration points.  The divers couldn’t find any bodies of the 255 missing passengers anywhere near the plane.  The Bermuda Triangle was searched resulting in nothing of use.  The journal entry you have read was located on Aurora’s Key beach in Puerto Rico.  The chilling entry is in relation to the crash of Aircraft 9874.  We are looking more into it as time goes on.  This is all we have discovered so far.  If more information comes out, we will inform you detective.*
