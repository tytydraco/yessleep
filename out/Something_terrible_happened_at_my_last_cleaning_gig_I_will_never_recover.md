Please forgive me if I don't use the proper terminology here, I am not up-to-date and it seems to change all the time.

Anyway, I’ve known this couple in our town for many years- the wife, Tasha, is Slavic and, not to be stereotypical, she is quite intimidating in that tall beautiful way- all hair and Pilates legs and jewelry, the whole nine yards. And the husband, Brian, is local - we were actually at high school together. He's in business -quite wealthy, living in a beautiful large house in one of the most desirable school districts of our town.

Which is quite odd, in itself, because not having any children, why would they be paying such high property taxes for the privilege of being close to a school they don’t use?

I'm in catering myself, and I'd see them at different events and they were always quite friendly, Brian is super-nice and very good-looking, and Tasha, well I guess she made an effort to be nice. She always looks very dour. One time I had to drop off some stuff at their house for an event we were doing for one of Brian’s businesses, she opened the door and in response to my standard “How are you?” she muttered “I’m thinking of packing my suitcases and leaving, never coming back” and I wasn’t quite sure how to answer that. I know childlessness- sorry, being childfree, affects families in different ways and you have to be understanding.

With the pandemic, of course all the events and catering everything shut down, and to keep myself afloat, I picked up some cleaning gigs. I put the word around and Brian reached out and soon enough I was there twice a week, cleaning their beautiful big house. Brian was definitely one of the most well-connected men I knew, and I meant to do a great job and cultivate business for after this pesky pandemic was over.

It wasn’t easy though. It was clear Tasha had very high standards, and she would come and stand there, watch me critically as I was mopping the floor or dusting their precious knick-knacks and elaborate flower and candle arrangements, and then silently point to a spot I missed. And then there were five bedrooms- all decorated beautifully. I vacuumed and dusted away, never knowing when Tasha would be standing silently at the door, her arms folded across her shapely chest, bright blond hair cascading down her shoulders, ready to point out an extra task or something I’d missed.

I was not to go up to the third floor, said Tasha on my first day.

Fine, I’m not dying for a whole extra floor to clean! I thought in response. I nodded and smiled. “That is private” she added, staring at me intensely with her steely blue eyes. I nodded again, wanting to get away from her. I felt creeped out, but I put it down to some internalized xenophobia.

Of course, human nature being what it is, next time I was there, I was itching to go up to the third floor. In fact, I was staring at the heavy bolted door at the stairwell on the second floor, when Tasha appeared as if out of nowhere. “You finished here?’ she asked, startling me. “faster each time, yes? You didn’t do fridge”. Was cleaning the inside of the fridge part of my duties? I was wising up to my new gig, realising I should have been more specific about what I would and would not do. It was too late now. I started to follow Tasha obediently to the kitchen

As I turned away, I heard scuffling noises from behind the heavy door.

Then a low whisper. "Mommy?"

My heart skipped a beat.

The whisper became slightly stronger. “Can I come out and play please Mommy? I’ll be very quiet.”

I looked at Tasha's receding back, her blonde hair swaying over her hips, and turned back to the door.

"Um, Tasha?" I called, my voice quaking.

Tasha turned round and snapped "You step away from the door, NOW!" Her face looked demonic- and I trotted after her, too frozen for any other response. We walked to the kitchen in silence.

There were lots of Kinder eggs, little yoghurt cups and cheese strings inside the fridge – the wrappings decorated with bright animals and dinosaurs. Tasha remained, watching me from the kitchen door. I was sweating with the effort of reaching and wiping down the back of the giant fridge which could comfortably accommodate three bodies, if sawn in half, of course.  

She walked up closer - I could smell her perfume, and I flinched. Her eyes flicked over the fridge.  

Why don’t they hire professional cleaning companies? The answer floats unbidden to my mind *“because Brian knows and trusts you”.*  

A large crash from upstairs somewhere startled both of us. Tasha mutters something in her mother tongue, grabs a handful of kids’ snacks, and without saying a word marches off.  I let out the breath I had been holding since coming into the kitchen.

I paused for rest, and some papers on the counter caught my eye- they were not there earlier. I glanced over- it was an article about genetic defects and mental disorders in children.  

Brian walked in, looking stressed. He saw me handling the papers, although I made a pretence of straightening them out. He snatched them out of my hand and then apologized.  

“Sorry, it just gets harder every day, you know”.  

I thought he was referring to the pandemic and nodded sympathetically. “I know Brian, it will ease up soon, it must.” 

“No. It gets worse as they grow older and stronger.”  

He left the kitchen, and I left soon after without seeing either of them.  

Next time, the place seemed more untidy. There was a stuffed bear under the couch. I pulled it out and stared the scruffy old thing, so out of place in this elegant living room. Tasha appeared. “Oh thank god you find this” she cried.  “I was looking for it everywhere, he was going crazy.” She ran out of the room, but not before I noticed the bruises on her braceleted wrist.

I wasn’t sure what to do. I kept on cleaning, keeping my head low, reminding myself of the short-term cash as well as the long-term prospect of being in their good graces.

I finished the downstairs area, and went upstairs, making sure not even to look towards the heavy bolted door to the third floor. Tasha was nowhere in sight.

I saw Brian as I entered one of the rooms. He was sitting on the bed, holding his head in his hands.

“Everything ok? Should I come back later?” I asked gently.  

“No, it’s just shameful you know” he muttered. He looked up at me, his blue eyes full of pain. “you know us, know my family, don’t you? There’s never been anything like this among us, has there?”

I shake my head dumbly. I don’t know what to say.

He brushed away, and left the room. He had left his iPad on the bed, and I notice the screen before it goes dark- health and genetics, something about “Defective children”.  

I decide to leave straight away and never come back, my heart was racing too fast, no cleaning gig was worth this. I slipped away, unseen.

That evening, I was scrolling through my newsfeed while my mind leapt around, wondering what to do. Should I call someone? But who? And say what?

Suddenly a local Tweet pops up. “Flames spotted at Windsor & Young”.

That’s where Brain and Tasha live. Without knowing why, I rush out and drive over.

I reach there almost the same time as fire engines draw up. But they are too late, flames are consuming the beautiful mansion. Brian is standing on the front lawn, by himself.

“Brian!” I call, running up to him.

He turns around, smiling cheerfully, his face lit darkly by the flames.

“I had to do it. Both of them. She brought it into this world- it wasn’t from me or my side.”

I back away slowly, jump into my car and drive away.

Tasha and a child perished in the house fire and I live with the guilt to this day.
