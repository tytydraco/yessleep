It started with the keys.

I live with my roommate, Aaron. We've shared a two-bedroom apartment for eight months. We've never argued. We split bills, alternate dishes, talk when we feel like it. Pretty standard.

Then one morning, I found my car keys sitting on the kitchen counter. I always hang them by the door. Always. I have OCD about that. I asked Aaron if he moved them. He said no, looked confused, even helped me search for my spare set when I started panicking.

I brushed it off as stress. Maybe I'd misplaced them half-asleep.

Then the same thing happened three days later: this time with my wallet. It was sitting perfectly centered on the dining table, like it had been placed there deliberately.

Aaron swore again that he hadn't touched it. I believed him at first, because he looked tired, irritated even. He said, "You're overthinking it, man. Maybe you did it yourself."

I laughed it off. But later that night, I watched him. When he thought I was asleep, he went into the kitchen. I heard the drawer open; the one where I keep spare batteries, cables, random junk. When I checked in the morning, everything inside was rearranged neatly into lines. Batteries by size, cords coiled, all perfectly straight.

I confronted him. He just stared for a second and said, "You didn't like how it was before."

Thing is, I never told him that.

Over the next week, it got worse. My toothbrush kept moving to the opposite side of the sink. My shoes faced the wrong direction by the door. My phone charger appeared on his desk once, even though I hadn't been in his room.

I started locking my door when I left for work. Came home one evening to find my desk lamp turned on, facing the wall, and a note under it that said "It's better this way." The handwriting was mine.

I confronted Aaron again, shaking. He looked calm. Too calm. He said, "I didn't go in your room. You must've left it like that."

Then he smiled slightly and added, "You shouldn't accuse people when you're sleepwalking."

That stopped me cold. I've never sleepwalked in my life.

He showed me a video that night: grainy footage from the cheap security camera he'd set up in the hallway. At around 3:20 a.m., the video showed me leaving my room, walking down the hall, disappearing into the kitchen. Five minutes later I came back, carrying something. The image was too dark to see what.

Aaron said he set up the camera because he thought someone was moving things around. He said, "Now we know it was you."

I wanted to believe him. But something about the way he said "we" made my stomach turn.

Last night, I stayed up past three, pretending to sleep. Around 3:17, I heard the floor creak. I held my breath.

The sound came from inside my room.

A shadow moved past the edge of my desk. I grabbed my phone's flashlight. Nothing. The chair by the door was slightly turned, facing me now.

I checked the hallway camera this morning. The file was gone. Deleted.

Aaron said he never touched it.

When I went to brush my teeth, there was a new toothbrush beside mine; same color, same brand. I don't remember buying it.

And tonight, my keys are gone again.

The hook by the door is empty.

But there's a second set now, hanging right beside it. Identical to mine; same keychains, same little chip on the corner.

Except the initials engraved on the metal aren't mine anymore. They're his.
