It was a night like any other. I remember it clearly, every tormenting, traumatizing. and gut-wrenchingly gruesome thing that happened that night. You'd think after something as awful as this, a person would at every waking moment, try the hardest, or beg God, on hands and bended knees to forget a night like this. Not I, oh, no, by forces to be explained soon, I am not allowed to forget. So, for two reasons and two reasons alone, do I tell you about this fateful night. The first, so you never make the same mistakes I did, and the second. To warn others to never, and I mean NEVER, take anything without making sure that those same forces that watch us sleep each night, consent.

The doorbell rang, filling the house with that high pitched note, that for some unexplained reason, fills every occupant of it's plaster wrapped cage with a sort of blissful anticipation.

"I'll get it." Shouted Darcey, not more than a second later from the kitchen. Ahh, Darcey, I could've listened to her voice for a lifetime and never had grown weary of it. She ran past my office to the front door, to greet our awaiting fellow victims of this night's tragedies. I had gotten a subtle, yet very euphoric, whiff of her perfume as she ran past, completely snapping me from my work. I couldn't help myself, I smiled wide as my heart, once again, fell in love with this woman.

"Darcey, you didn't have to run! I could've gotten it!" I yelled to her, as I chuckled.

"You probably didn't even hear the bell!" Darcey retorted with a laugh. She was right, I hadn't. "It's Mark and Carolyn!" Darcey called, as she opened the door. "hi, friends!" she greeted.

"Hi!" Mark and Carolyn said in unison, stepping into the foyer. "I hope we're not too terribly late. We got a little turned around on the way here."  Carolyn said. By this time I had made it to the hall to also greet the couple with a smile, watching as Darcey embraced both of them individually, for the last time.

"Oh, no, not at all, dinner isn't even out of the oven yet." Darcey responded back with a smile, closing the door behind them as they finished hugging and entering the house.

"Danniel, my man." Mark said, embracing me.

"Mark!" I exclaimed, as I returned the hug, and gave him a pat on the back. "I have something extraordinary to show you, my friend." I said, pushing him back by his shoulders, but maintaining my grip on them as I looked into his eyes.

"Danniel, work talk can wait for now, don't you agree?" Darcey questioned, even though it felt more like a statement.

"Of course, love, we can discuss it later." I agreed looking back to Mark, releasing him from my grasp. "We should wait till after dinner." I said smiling.

Darcey rolled her eyes and sighed, looking down to the ground before chuckling. "That's not what I meant."

Mark and Carolyn both laughed. and I gave Carolyn a friendly hug, before showing them into the living room.

"will you need any help in the kitchen Darc?" Carolyn asked.

"No, it's almost ready, you guys relax. and I'll have it out soon." Darcey responded, reentering the kitchen to finish up her work.

We sat and talked for around another thirty minutes, awaiting eagerly to eat whatever it was Darcey was preparing. No matter what she made, which recipe she followed. Her food always came out looking delicious, smelling amazing, and tasting even better than that.

\*ding dong\*

Once again, that signifying note. I felt my stomach tighten, something felt wrong about their being a second ring, but I shrugged it off as hunger pains as I got up to greet the door. I hadn't even made it past the coffee table in the middle of the room before hearing Darcey Scream from the direction of the door. I looked toward Mark, and we ran to the foyer to see what had happened. However it was just, Darcey,  standing in front of a wide open door, and nothing else.

"Darcey, honey, are you alright?" I asked as reached to touch her now exposed shoulder. She felt like ice, and turned so quickly at my touch, that I had to pull my hand back to keep from hitting her.

"Why of course baby, why wouldn't I be" Darcey said with a smile. That gut feeling showed itself again. In our 6 years of being together, she never once called me baby.

"Well, you did just scream at the door." Mark chimed with a laugh.

Darcey went expressionless at Mark's comment, and walked away from us and the opened door, back into the kitchen to finish dinner, or so I thought. Mark shrugged it off and walked back to the living room to join Carolyn again. I looked outside, and took a step onto the porch to get a full view. and off in the distance, for only a moment. I thought I had seen Darcey, jaw dropped like she was screaming, but no sound making it's way to me. A bang in the kitchen drew my attention away, and when I looked back the other Darcey was gone. I went back inside,  shut the door, and headed into the kitchen to investigate the bang.

"Darc, are you sure you're alright?" I asked with worry entering the kitchen.

"Yes, could you ask Carolyn to come join me? I need help finishing up the main course." Darcey replied, her voice sounding emotionless and monotone.

"Yeah, umm, do you not want me to help you? I'm right he-."

"No!" Darcey loudly interrupted, "it has to be Carolyn." She demanded.

"Oh, okay, Ill go get her then." I snapped back, exiting the kitchen frustrated. I stepped into the living room and informed Carolyn that her assistance was now needed, and plopped myself back down on the couch. Carolyn excused herself. and left for the kitchen, while Mark and I continued conversing.

"Now that the ladies are gone, are you gonna tell me what had you so excited when we first arrived, Mr.Folklore?" Mark teased.

"Oh, yes, I almost forgot about that." I remarked ecstatic. "I found actual evidence that ancient beings, such as the wendigo, or katshituashku, actually exist in our world, or did at some point in history." I explained.

Mark looked genuinely intrigued. "So, what does that mean?"

"It means that dinner is ready." Darcey chimed from behind us as she set the last covered dish on the table.

"Ah, sorry honey," I replied, a little startled by her sudden appearance. Mark and I got up and walked around the couch toward the table. I scooted my seat out tot sit, as Mark had already seated himself and taken a huge gulp of water.

"What's Carolyn doing?" Mark asked.

"Why," Darcey started, as she lifted one of the faux silver lids revealing her 'dish' to us, like a child showing off a new Christmas present. "She's going to be feeding us.

Mark fell back along with his chair, breaking it as they both hit the ground. I looked at the entre with utter disgust, as a large wave of nausea overtook me. It was Carolyn's head, with her skull cut open and removed to reveal her brain, her eyes rolled back and puffed red, like she had been strangled to death. Just sitting on a pile of what I could only assume to be her entrails. 

"What the f\*\*\*?" Mark yelled as he got back to his feet, only to be met with the blade of a kitchen knife slicing through his throat. Blood sprayed all over this thing that looked like Darcey, as it opened its mouth wide, wider than any human could, in attempt to catch some of the spray. I dropped to me knees and vomited all over myself before losing consciousness.

When I came too, my wrists and ankles were bound to a chair, and I opened my eyes. Carolyn's lifeless face greeted me, accompanied with the wet chewing of this creature feasting on Mark's dead body. "D- Darcey?" I stuttered.

the creature stopped feasting and turned to face me, "Darcey's gone too Danniel." It replied through a mouthful of flesh, sounding raspy, yet, filled with glee.

"What did you do to her?! What are you?!" I shouted as I fought with my restraints in anger, tears had already started pouring down my face.

The windows began to rattle and the lights began to flicker as though the house itself was laughing at me alongside the creature. The creature came close to me. "You should know! It was you that found my nest and destroyed my secrecy when you took those samples and photos."

I fought harder against my bonds, "I'm simply a researcher! I never meant to expose you, or cause you in form of harm." I shouted through my sobs.

"Lies!" It yelled back.  "All you humans do is expose, and all you greedy parasites want is money and fame. You couldn't wait to fill Mark up on my secrets, so I figured why should I wait to fill up on Mark, and Darcey, and Carolyn?" It laughed viciously.

"What do you want? I'll delete everything. I'll forget -"

"No!" It interrupted again, slamming its hands down on the table. "No, you'll never forget tonight. You'll always remember that we like our secrecy, and you'll always remember the cost of knowing those secrets, and sadly, nobody will ever take your word on it." It grinned, stretching Darcey's lips so wide I swore they would tear.

"Kill me too." I begged, hot salty liquid still running down my face. "Please, I.. I can't live without Darcey."

"And who said you deserve that mercy?" The creature chuckled. It turned away from me and reached down, grabbing Mark's lifeless ankle and started for the door.

"Wait!" I screamed, but it didn't. "Take me too!" I screamed again, but the creature had already left with Mark's corpse.

\--

It took me some time to get free. I don't recall exactly how long, but the creature was right, nobody ever believed me. In fact, nobody even remembered Mark, that overly extraverted and outgoing man, or Carolyn and how tender and gentle she was. What still gets me, even to this day, is that not even Darcey's own mother and father, can remember their selfless and caring daughter. I've tried to join her in the afterlife, but everything I try fails. Toaster in a tub? Power goes out before the damn thing hits the water. Gun? It either gets stuck or simply won't go off when pointed at myself. Rope? Snaps as soon as move the chair. Knife? Dull as a potato when ran across my neck.

I am forced to live without her. Forced to live with the memory and with the knowledge that Ill never be with her again. At least.. I get to remember her.
