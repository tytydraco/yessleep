My family was living in Texas at the time. I'd recently finished my master's degree when my grandmother asked me to make a trip to Arkansas on her behalf. She'd moved to Texas with us a few years earlier, after my grandfather died, but she still kept her old house. It was the one she'd grown up in, the one where she'd raised my mother. I remembered it fondly from childhood visits, though I hadn't been back in over a decade.

The house was in a very rural area. My grandmother's only neighbor was her Aunt Clara. My cousin still lived out in Arkansas and served as caretaker for the property, but he'd recently had surgery. So I offered to help out by cutting the grass at my grandmother's house and Aunt Clara's, and tend to the old family graveyard that was located about an acre down the road.

I needed to pick up a few things my grandmother hadn't been able to bring during the move. Sentimental items, mostly: an old Bible and some photo albums she kept mentioning, plus a couple of pieces of furniture and an old family recipe. So I packed my bag, hitched the trailer to my truck, and started out on the eight-hour drive to Arkansas.

I pulled off the Arkansas highway into what felt like the middle of nowhere and onto the old gravel road. It was about a ten-minute drive to the two houses from there. The barn looked just as I remembered it. The old rusted tractor still sat under the oak tree. The yards were definitely overgrown.

I parked at my grandmother's house and decided to go tell Aunt Clara hi first, let her know I was there. I knocked and knocked, but no one answered. I tried calling my cousin, but the reception was poor. I knew he was recovering from surgery anyway, so I didn't want to bother him. I just assumed she'd return later, hopefully pleased to find her grass cut.

I opened the old shed next to the barn. The riding mower and weed eater were right where I'd been told they'd be. I cut the grass and trimmed around both houses, then just drove the mower down to the old graveyard. It was overgrown too. I cut and trimmed the grass there as well.

As I was trimming around the graves, I noticed that some of them looked tampered with. The dirt seemed freshly dug and then replaced along the sides of a few. An old hammer and chisel lay next to some of the brick graves. It looked like someone had been deliberately removing the bricks. I didn't know what was going on. Maybe maintenance or something. Maybe my cousin had a reason for it or knew about it. I figured I'd ask him later.

When I got back to the house, I noticed Aunt Clara had returned. She was walking into her back door as I pulled up on the mower. I went over and said hi. She remembered me. She was boiling something inside that smelled like I don't know what. Some old-time concoction meant to cure the flu or something. I remember it being hard to talk to her while smelling it. She had to be almost ninety. I remember thinking that while we talked about my grandmother and how long she'd lived next door. It was getting dark and I was tired, so I told her goodbye and walked back over to my grandmother's house.

That night, after a sandwich for dinner and a shower, I gathered all of my grandmother's things that she requested and placed them in a bag by the door. I told myself I would load the furniture in the trailer in the morning. I went to bed in my mom's old room at the back of the house. I remember lying awake, unable to sleep. It was so quiet out there. No TV, no internet, no nothing. I guess I should have brought a book.

A little past eleven that night I heard Aunt Clara's back door open and close. I looked out the window and saw her walking down the path toward the old graveyard. No flashlight or anything, just moonlight. She moved remarkably well for her age. I thought about going to meet her, but I figured she's out here all the time by herself. I guess this is just what she does. I didn't want to disturb her or anything. Her husband was buried out there. So I just tried to go back to sleep.

I couldn't sleep though. I sat up and decided to just watch for her out the window. She came back maybe half an hour later holding what looked like a burlap sack. She carried it into the house, once again through the back door.

I had to go check on her. I got up and walked across the yard to her house. I knocked and waited, but she didn't answer. I decided to try the front door. Again, no answer. I went back around to the back door and could see her moving around in the kitchen through the window. I also smelled that terrible smell again. Why would she be cooking that at this time? Seemed off. The woman had to be ninety years old. Maybe dementia or something?

This time I decided to just go in. The door was unlocked and I figured she needed help. The smell was ten times worse inside. I called for her and met her in the kitchen. She seemed upset that I was in the house. I tried to tell her I was just concerned. She just told me, "I always cook at this time. You need to go back to your grandmother's house." I apologized and felt bad about going in because I felt like I'd invaded her privacy. I really was just concerned.

I saw the burlap sack in the kitchen on my way out and decided to peek inside. What I saw told me that something was terribly wrong. I was pretty sure I was looking at the bottom part of a human jawbone. I could see the teeth. I decided to look in the pot she was boiling as well. Once again, bones. They had to be human too.

How long had she been doing this? I thought to myself. She needed psychological help as soon as possible. I didn't want to know what she was doing with the bones or the water she was boiling them in.

"You shouldn't be doing this," I told her.

She just kept saying that the pot and the soup were hers and that I shouldn't touch it. She kept repeating, "It's mine. I made it. You need to go back to your grandmother."

I felt freaked out, completely disgusted, and heartbroken all at once. How could her family leave her out here like this? At this age, doing psychotic shit like boiling the bones of her dead family members. I had no idea how to approach this.

We stood there in the kitchen arguing back and forth for what felt like an hour. The stench was so bad. It was even more terrible once I knew what it was from. I vomited in the sink. I eventually started trying to convince her to just go to bed. I pleaded with her. "Go to bed and we can find help in the morning." She didn't care at all about what I was saying. She wouldn't let me turn the fire off on the stove. At that point I had to get out and call for help. This was just too much.

I went outside and tried to call my cousin first. He wouldn't answer. I got in the truck and drove to the graveyard to take pictures. Why did I feel the need to document this shit? I have no clue. I guess I felt like it was a crime. I got there and I was just shaking. I could barely hold my phone to take the pictures. She had completely removed multiple bricks from two of the old graves and started digging a new hole next to one of the newer ones. My head was spinning. I couldn't believe this.

Someone finally answered my phone call. My mother answered after I called her three or four times. She could hear the distress in my voice as I started telling her about Aunt Clara and the psychotic shit she was doing. I remember telling her that Aunt Clara needed medical assistance and psychiatric help now. "She is not in her right mind at all and she's in her nineties out here all by herself," I told her. I explained what Aunt Clara was doing.

Then my mother told me something that made me freeze and brought a heavy, uncanny silence and stillness over my mind and body. She told me that Aunt Clara had died seven years ago. How could I have missed her grave earlier? I felt like I looked at all of them. It was here with the other ones. I looked around and found it. Aunt Clara's grave. Death date over seven years ago. Who, or what, was cooking?

I ran for my truck, jumped in and started it up. I hit the gas as hard as I could and sped toward the highway. I could see it stirring the pot in the window as I drove away.
