It was another monotonous night shift at RetroSound, the vintage audio store nestled between a used bookstore and a closed-down diner on the outskirts of town. The store was my sanctuary, filled with relics of a bygone era: vinyl records, antique radios, and the scent of dust mixed with aged wood. My task for the night was inventory - a task I found both tedious and comforting.  

To break the silence, I decided to play DJ, spinning the dial on an old Panasonic radio that had seen better days. Static filled the air as I searched for a station, any station, that wasn't playing the latest pop or news updates about the city's unending construction projects.  

"Come on, you ancient thing," I muttered, giving the radio a gentle tap.  

And then, something caught my ear. It wasn't the classic rock I hoped for, nor was it the smooth jazz I often settled with. It was something... otherworldly. A station playing nostalgic music, crackling through the airwaves as if it were being broadcast from another time. And then, a song began—abruptly, no intro, just a haunting female voice singing in a language I couldn't understand.  

"Whoa, what's this?" I mused aloud, my boredom instantly forgotten.  

The song was eerie, beautiful, and utterly mesmerizing. The host returned briefly, mentioning the title, "Lullaby of Shadows," and the artist, Ekaterina of Shadows, but provided no backstory or details.  

Curiosity ignited within me. I couldn't shake the melody from my head the next day. It played over and over, a loop that wouldn't stop. At work, I tried to describe it to my colleague, Mike.  
"It was eerie, man. Like nothing I've heard before," I explained, humming the tune.  

Mike, always the skeptic, raised an eyebrow. "Sounds like you picked up some pirate radio station. Stuff's rare but not unheard of."  

The next day, fueled by an obsessive need to find the song, I turned to the internet. I posted on several music forums, describing the song and its abrupt introduction, asking if anyone recognized it. Days passed with only a trickle of generic responses, until one message caught my eye.

"Your description of 'Lullaby of Shadows' brought back memories of my late grandfather's record collection. He was fond of Soviet-era music, and this song was among his favorites. I believe I have the record you're seeking and would be willing to send it to you."

Intrigued and a bit skeptical, I replied, providing my mailing address but not expecting much. To my surprise, a package arrived a week later, containing the promised record. Eager to dive deeper into this mystery, I decided to play it at the audio store where I worked, thinking the vintage equipment there would do it justice.  

"Hey, check this out," I called to my colleagues, Alexei and Marina, as I placed the record on the turntable. The song started, Ekaterina's voice filling the store with its haunting melody.  

"Wow, this is... different," Marina commented, her brow furrowed in a mix of confusion and fascination.  

Alexei, usually the joker of our group, was silent, his gaze fixed on the spinning record. As the song played on, a palpable tension settled over us, a strange, unsettling atmosphere that I couldn't shake off.  

Once the song ended, the effect was immediate. Marina complained of feeling dizzy, while Alexei mentioned a sudden headache. I felt a chill run down my spine, but I brushed it off as a coincidence.  

Over the next few days, Marina and Alexei called in sick, their conditions worsening. Phone calls to them went unanswered, and my concern grew. Then came the shocking news—Alexei was found dead in his apartment, the cause of death an unusual heart attack.  

Distraught and desperate for answers, I updated my forum post with everything that had happened. That's when "SiberianTruth" contacted me via email.

Subject: Urgent: The Truth About "Lullaby of Shadows"  

Hi Ethan,  

I cannot stress enough the urgency with which you must heed my warning. The song you've stumbled upon, "Колыбельная теней (Lullaby of Shadows)," is not just a piece of music; it's a relic of a dark past intertwined with the life and tragic end of its singer, Екатерина Ивановна Петрова (Ekaterina Ivanovna Petrova), known by her stage name Екатерина Теней (Ekaterina of Shadows).  

Ekaterina was a prominent figure in the 1930s Soviet music scene, a woman whose voice could enchant and terrify in equal measure. Born in 1905 in Yaroslavl, she was deeply influenced by Russian folklore and the mystic practices that lingered in the rural parts of the country. Her fascination with the occult grew alongside her musical career, leading her down a path from which there was no return.  

"Lullaby of Shadows" was her final recording, made in a small, dimly lit studio in Moscow, 1937. Those present at the recording session spoke of a palpable sense of dread, a cold that seeped into their bones, and a feeling of being watched by unseen eyes. The song, they said, was different from anything Ekaterina had ever performed - it was as if she wasn't alone in its creation.  

Shortly after the song's recording, Ekaterina's behavior became increasingly erratic. She spoke of visions, of spirits that had begun to haunt her day and night, demanding more from her than she could give. Her obsession with the occult had reached its zenith, and with it, her isolation from those who once were close.  

In the winter of 1938, Ekaterina was found dead in her Moscow apartment, an apparent suicide. Her death was shrouded in mystery, with rumors suggesting that the spirits she sought to control through her music had claimed her instead.  

Enclosed with this message, you'll find a portrait of Ekaterina. It's one of the last photographs taken of her, capturing the haunting beauty and depth of sorrow in her eyes. Let this serve as a reminder of the human cost behind the song that has so captivated you.  

Please, I urge you to reconsider your decision to share "Lullaby of Shadows" further. This song, and Ekaterina's story, are potent reminders that some forces, once awakened, cannot be easily put to rest.  

With grave sincerity,  

SiberianTruth

Her expression is one of profound sadness mixed with a hint of something unexplainable, a testament to her tragic and mysterious legacy.

The warning sent chills down my spine, but a part of me refused to believe. A dangerous curiosity overpowered my fear, and I made the decision to share the song online. I digitized the recording and uploaded it to streaming services, thinking perhaps the modern world could withstand the song's supposed curse.  

Comments poured in, stories of dread, hallucinations, and an inexplicable sadness from those who dared listen. "Lullaby of Shadows" was going viral, but at what cost?  

As I sift through the comments, a mixture of fear and guilt washes over me. I had unleashed something far beyond my understanding, something that perhaps should have remained forgotten.  

In my quest for answers, I had ignored the most important question of all: what are the consequences of awakening shadows best left undisturbed?  

For those who dare, the song is out there, a click away. But remember, you've been warned. Listen at your own risk.
