Traveling in a beautiful, lesser known city, I made a mistake. When I was traversing this dazzling place, I came across many wishes. At least, that's what I assumed them to be.

A large elephant shrine sat shrouded by red, yellow, red, and white tokens. All in a line on a string, dangling down. A bell was at the bottom of each string. Each one had something written on it, mostly in Sharpie, in a language I unfortunately didn't understand.

After seeing this, I was under the assumption that these were wishes. Placed here by locals and perhaps some tourists. The beauty and seriousness of the whole display made me think that perhaps it was actually real. 

I don't know why, maybe I’m a selfish person, but upon the understanding that wishes could come true, I didn't think to write one for myself. Instead, I decided I would take existing ones off. That way, I could have more wishes than I could count. Of course, there was the problem in that I didn't know what any of them said.

I figured there was no harm in it, these people's wishes had already come true, right?

Another problem I ran into was that this was an immensely crowded tourist area. Kind of hard to take one unnoticed. So, I decided nightfall would be the right time. After continuing the rest of my day like normal, I waited until 3 a.m. to make my heist. 

I brought a pair of scissors and cut down the first one I saw, stuffing it into my pocket. My thought process was, I’d better just try one at first to test it out, and not give too much suspicion. I figured it would be noticeable if a large chunk of them were gone all at once. I also took my wish from the back of the display for safe measure. Since it was less likely to be missed and the person who wished for it, probably already had their wish fulfilled.

I walked back to my hotel. Lounging around on my bed, I didn't feel any different. I supposed this was a problem. If these wishes really worked, how was I to know when it was fulfilled? It could be anything.

Then, I had thought of using a translator app and running the wishes through that to see what it said. However, these were written in a local language, which as far as I know, cannot be translated this way.

I was ready to call it a night, checking my phone as usual when I spotted something. Opening my bank account, I was greeted with a new deposit. One million dollars. I was over the moon. It really worked! 

Of course, this led me to a few more questions. Had I scammed someone out of their million? No, surely they must have spent theirs by now, right? So, it must have been fine. 

To say I hit the jackpot was an understatement. I just so happened to pick one of the most generic things you could wish for, but that was a great thing.

I couldn't believe it. It really worked. And the first wish, a million bucks, what luck! I could've stopped there and been content for the rest of my life. Matter of fact, I should have stopped there. But, I didn't. Greed took a hold of me. I stole two more.

The first one I didn't notice until I had to take a piss. Well, let's just say, someone wished for a little extra manhood. It was no million dollars, but I certainly wasn't complaining. 

The next one was admittedly a little odd, and it took quite a while to notice. The next day, I kept noticing a butterfly of the exact same color, everywhere I went. Without fail. So, this person wished for a butterfly to follow them around? Okay, these were starting to get weak. Again, I should've stopped at this point, called it quits. This just wasn't right. 

But, I couldn't help myself. This time I yanked a whole string of them, from the furthest corner. Where it would take someone a long time to notice they were gone. I sure wish i hadn't.

I received a phone call shortly afterwards. It was the police. 

"We're calling in regard to your family. You may want to sit down for this." 

Oh god, what did he mean by that? My throat dried up. I listened to the gruff officer speak, tears welling in my eyes.

My mind raced. What was I to do now? Who the hell wished for their immediate family dead? God, I really fucked up. But that was only the first wish of six.

Surely this couldn't be right. No one would ever wish for such a thing. I guess it's possible someone was abused by their entire family, but I don't know. It just seems like too much. To wish your loved ones dead? I couldn't believe it.

As I had these dark thoughts, I noticed something was different. My vision was suddenly super clear. It felt like everything was blurry before. Okay, I thought, that's not bad. Wishing for better sight, seems like a reasonable request. 

When I arrived back at my hotel, preparing to pack my bags, I looked into the bathroom mirror. Only to be greeted with a disturbing sight. Right in the middle of my forehead was an extra eye. It was huge, bigger than my regular eyes and... it didn't blink. 

I couldn't take this anymore. Why were all these wishes so strange now? What happened to the basic ones? I hoped a Lamborghini would show up under my name any moment. I still had four undiscovered wishes. I just wanted to go home. Then, the strangest thing happened.

As soon as I pictured my home in my mind, well, I was there. I didn't know how that was possible. I was just in another continent on vacation a split second ago. Now I was back in my house. Teleportation? Made sense. I'd have wished for that too. So, I decided to continue to try it out. But, where should I go? 

My best friend, Aaron. He always had answers, and well, frankly I was hoping he could help me get out of this predicament.

I did worry however realize that he would probably be totally freaked out by the whole thing. Teleportation. Three eyes. It was enough to scare the shit out of anybody. But still, I felt like I needed his advice. So, I closed my eyes and pictured his apartment. 

With a whoosh, there I was. When I opened my eyes, I was in his living room. However, something was horribly wrong. The wall and ceiling was coated in fresh blood and human bits, dripping down to the floor. I darted my head around, spotting littered bits of bone and chunks of hair. I turned around to see my best friend, Aaron. What was left of him anyways. 

Half of his body had been completely splattered, the other half lay crumpled on the floor. I screamed. Oh god, what have I done? That butterfly circled around me carefree, as if taunting me for my awful choices.

I still didn't know what my remaining three wishes were.
