We moved carefully down the corridor, the shriek of the facility alarm still blaring overhead—a constant, piercing reminder that we were running out of time. 

Beneath the siren’s wail, other sounds crept in. 

Wet, slithering drags echoed from somewhere unseen. Bone-like clicks tapped out irregular rhythms from dark corners. Somewhere distant, something let out a gurgling, broken howl that chilled me straight to the marrow.

I didn’t want to know what other horrors were stalking these halls.

As we pushed deeper into the facility, we stuck to the walls. More than once, we hid behind corners as the footsteps of the cloaked figures ran by. We cut through an unlit storage corridor, only to come face-to-face with something. 

A hulking, four-legged shape, slick and bristling with matted fur, crouched at the end of the hallway. Its long, malformed jaws hung slightly ajar, a viscous string of saliva connecting its teeth, while two pale, lidless eyes locked onto us.

It didn’t hesitate. Neither did we.

We bolted, sprinting until our lungs burned, ducking into the first room we could find and slamming the door behind us. I pressed my ear to the metal, listening as heavy, wet footsteps slowed and eventually drifted past, the creature's ragged breathing fading into the distance.

Relief hadn’t even finished washing over me when I noticed Ryan wasn’t moving. 

He stood by the far wall, staring intently at an empty shelf. “Damon,” his voice was quiet but curious. “There’s door hinges behind this shelf.” I walked over to him. “Maybe there's a way out behind it.” 

Together, we shoved the rusted metal aside, and behind it, hidden beneath decades of dust and rot, was a narrow, corroded door. We forced it open, the hinges screaming in protest, and stepped inside.

The air was stale and cold.

Rows of monitors lined the walls, flickering between static, night-vision feeds, and distorted thermal camera views of rooms. Some screens showed figures—human shapes, barely more than shadows, strapped to operating tables. Others displayed cages, some empty, some not.

The desks were littered with files—some thick with pages of incomprehensible data, others displaying grotesque anatomical sketches.

Ryan stepped up to a terminal. He stared at the wall of monitors, eyes scanning. He wasn’t saying anything, just… taking it all in. I moved closer. “What is this place?”

He didn’t answer. 

Just stood there, still as stone. One screen showed a wide-angle shot of the hallway we had just come from. Another displayed a cell. A figure inside, hunched and unmoving. I caught a glimpse of Ryan's reflection in the monitor. His skin was paler than before. 

Clammy. 

His right hand was trembling—not from fear, but from something deeper. His veins had gone black, like ink was running under his skin.

“Ryan…” I stepped toward him. He didn’t face me. Just shook his head. “Damon. This whole facility is for **\[R̵͘E̴͠D̶͝A̶͘C̴̀T̷͠É̵D̸̕\]**. The file I read earlier was full of people’s names.”

I felt something cold settle in my chest.

Ryan turned to me, finally, and I saw how tired he looked. Not just physically but, like something inside him had already accepted the worst. However, he was still trying to hold on. “Listen,” he said. “You need to keep going.”

“What? No. No way. We’re getting out together.” He tried to smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “It’s too late for me.” My stomach dropped. “Don’t say that.”

“I blacked out back there, Damon,” he said softly. “When I… when I killed that thing. I don’t even remember doing it. I just remember its—”

“It was self-defense—”

“No.” He cut me off. “You saw me. I didn’t look human right?”

There was silence between us for a moment. 

Heavy. 

Crushed under the weight of something unspeakable.

He stepped over to the terminal and started typing. “If I’m going out, I’m at least taking this place down with me.”

“You’re not doing this,” I said, panic rising. “We can find help, we can fix it—”

He turned sharply. His eyes were glassy, almost colorless, but there was something behind them. 

Not rage. Not sorrow.

But resolve.

“You have to go,” he said. “Before I become something I can’t come back from.” 

My throat closed up.

And then I saw it—the faintest ripple under the skin of his neck, something moving just beneath the surface. He saw me looking but he didn’t flinch.

“Please,” he whispered. 

I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t want to leave him. But when he turned back to the console and hit **Enter**, the lights above us flickered and a door behind me hissed open—my only way forward. I stared at him one last time.

He didn’t turn around.

Just kept typing, even as his hand started to spasm and twitch. I forced myself to walk through the door. Once I was through, the door slammed closed.

I was alone again.

I stumbled forward into a tunnel. The air was damp and foul, thick with rot. After walking for what felt like a mile. I collapsed against the wall and slid down to the ground. The darkness felt alive, like it was pressing in on me.

I waited. 

Praying Ryan would follow. But I knew it was in vain. Just as the silence began to feel unbearable, I heard—slow, wet footsteps, echoing from the corridor I had just been in.

Hope flooded me. “Could that be Ryan,” I thought, pushing myself upright.

But before I could even turn—“Damon,” a voice whispered. Right behind me.

I froze.

It was a voice I recognized but haven’t heard in years.

It was my mother’s.

Every hair on my body stood on end. The temperature dropped like the air had been sucked out of the tunnel. “Damon,” it said again—gentle, coaxing. The way she used to say my name when I had nightmares as a kid.

But this wasn’t a dream.

I hadn’t heard her voice in years. She had gone missing when I entered high school. Tears welled in my eyes. I couldn’t move. My body wouldn’t let me. The thing behind me—whatever it was—kept repeating my name. The cadence was right, but the voice sounded more raspy, older.

I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms. I didn’t turn around. I wouldn’t. Because I convinced myself that whatever was behind me… it wasn’t my mother.

The wet footsteps were getting closer.

My stomach turned as I staggered back, my heel slipping on the damp floor. 

In that moment, I made a choice: whatever was imitating my mother had to be better than the thing coming.

I spun around and faced the dark. She was standing there. And—for a second—I forgot where I was.

It was her. 

Actually her. 

Not a hallucination. Not some mimicry. Her same kind eyes. Her same half-smile. I choked trying to swallow but the grief cracked open like a dam. 

I fell apart. 

My dad and I spent months searching. Putting up flyers. Hoping. Pretending. Slowly learning to live around the void, rather than confront it. It was easier to leave her there—a ghost in old photographs, a voice locked away in fading memories—than to admit the truth: that she was never coming back.

But here she was. Behind me.

“Damon,” she whispered again. I swallowed the lump rising in my throat. I couldn’t look at her. I wouldn’t. I tried to speak, but before I could even shape her name—the sound of something wet and heavy shuffled behind me. A gurgling moan snapped me out of my daze.

I didn’t think. I couldn’t. 

I bolted—past the woman who looked like my mother, past whatever illusion or mercy I might’ve imagined—down the tunnel, into the dark. 

And I didn’t look back.

I ran down the tunnel until I saw the glow of natural light. “I’m so close to being out of this hell hole!" I gasped, pushing through the searing pain in my chest, my body screaming for rest. 

I didn’t care. I had to make it. I had to make it for them. Derek, who sacrificed himself being bait. Ryan, who deep down, I knew wasn’t coming back. Their sacrifices wouldn’t be in vain.

I was getting closer and closer to the light. I could smell the fresh air. Freedom was so close I could taste it. Just as I was about to emerge into the light, everything went black.

I was disoriented, my vision blurry. When my sight cleared up, I was lying on a bed. In a dark room. I sat up too fast, my head spinning. 

My hands clutched at the sheets beneath me—familiar fabric. My stomach twisted. Slowly, I turned my head and scanned the room.

No.

No, no, no.

This was my room. 

My room. 

The same posters. The same desk. My old lamp, my worn-out chair. My laptop, its screen glowing softly in the dimness. I sucked in a shaky breath. "There’s no way that was all a dream… right?"

A sudden thought struck me.

"Wait—if this was a dream, then Derek and Ryan should be fine!" I threw off the covers and scrambled to my laptop. My hands shaking as I moved to open Discord. I scrolled up and down my friends list—nothing. My chest tightened as I manually typed in their usernames.

***User not found***.

Frantically, I searched my room for my phone. I found it on the nightstand and snatched it up. The screen glowed in the darkness. My stomach dropped as there was one solitary message sitting on the lock screen.
