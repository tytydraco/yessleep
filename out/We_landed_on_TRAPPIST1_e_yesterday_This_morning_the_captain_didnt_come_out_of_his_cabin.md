I have 47 minutes of oxygen left. Before I die, you need to know what NASA did.



Interstellar travel has been possible for years. 



Its invention was kept secret by NASA; only a few classified crews were aware of the technology’s capabilities.



A new mission was proposed a few years ago: finding life in the universe.



The planet chosen was TRAPPIST-1 e.



I was one of the fortunate astronauts picked for this adventure.



A day before the mission launch, a chief scientist on one of the old missions called my office.



“Don't go on that mission, Dave. The government knows more than they're letting on. The Astera mission didn’t burn up in Europa’s atmosphere. They…they were left out there to die.” He said in a nervous and trembling voice. 



Before I could say anything, he hung up.



He was a man I trusted, but this opportunity was too great to pass on.



Then launch day came.



Slow counting echoed through the speakers.



Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.



In two days, we traveled the distance to reach TRAPPIST-1 e.



“Descend in progress,” Spoke the captain through the speaker.



No turbulence, no storms in sight. The wind on TRAPPIST-1 e was eerily calm. 



The terrain outside was rocky, barren, and completely devoid of life.



That night, I was haunted by strange dreams, visions of humanoid-like creatures crawling along the barren plains.



Then one of them walked by my window. 



It slowly turned its head. The thing had the captain’s face.



I woke up in a puddle of cold sweat, my heart still pounding hard. 



I came out of my room. The crew was getting ready.



“Look who decided to wake up finally.” Poked John at me.



I fake-laughed. The dream was still too real in my mind. I couldn’t take his jokes.



I quickly changed into my suit and readied for the expedition. 



The ship doors slowly opened. The captain was the first one to set foot on this planet.



The gravity felt wrong, not lighter or heavier, but uneven.



Samples were collected mostly from the rocks and dust. 



Before walking back to the ship, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something move between two rocks far away. 



I quickly looked, but the plain was empty.



The next morning, when I woke up, the crew was already sitting in the cafeteria. 



I thought I’d be the last one to wake again, but the captain was missing.



“Where’s the captain?” I asked.



“Still asleep in his cabin. We tried knocking, but he didn’t answer.” John said.



Then the door of the captain's cabin opened and echoed through the ship.



His boots knocked on the ship’s floor in a strange, unrhythmic sound, like a child learning how to walk.



The cafeteria was quiet. Everyone sat and stared at the door, listening. A wave of stillness filled the room.  



Tap, tap.



The steps were coming ever so closer until you heard the captain stop in front of the cafeteria door. 



Then strange thuds echoed behind the door. 



It sounded like the captain's hand was hitting the wall around the opening button.



I tried to keep my cool, but I could feel my right leg starting to shake in rhythmic twitches.



Then a final thud. The hand finally found the button. 



All of us were now staring at the door in front of us. Hypnotized by the spectacle that was occurring. 



I almost didn’t want the door to open. Something deep inside of me knew that there would be nothing good awaiting on the other side.



The captain was now standing outside the door, but it quickly became apparent that it was not the captain. It was someone or something wearing his skin.



The thing’s bright sulfur eyes were staring through the captain’s eyeholes, darting from one crewmate to another. 



Its arms slung down next to the weak-looking body. 



The face hung down on the creature's head like a shriveled grape.



The thing then tried to speak. 



The sounds that came out were an assault on my ears. 



It was as if the creature was trying to imitate human sounds in strange, terrifying screeches.



It moved closer again.



I wanted to run or attack it, but my body was stuck. I couldn’t even move my hands or feet. 



Then I heard a loud bang. 



The creature screeched so loud it sent pain down my ears. The captain's skin fell to the ground like a balloon deflating. 



Then a dark red shadow quickly skimmed out of the door.



I looked back and saw Jack with a gun in his hand. He stood there, now frozen too, still pointing at the captain’s skin lying on the ground.



“What the fuck was that thing?” Oscar yelled out.



We all rushed to the captain's cabin simultaneously. When we ran out of the cafeteria, I looked on the ground. 



Strange, dark-blue stains were splattered across the ship’s floor. My foot accidentally stepped on one of them. It was sticky like melted sugar and smelled of rotten apples.



Jack was the first one to arrive at the captain's room. He stopped dead in his tracks and let out a terrified gasp.



He then took a few steps back, started gagging, and then threw up on the floor.



The captain’s skinless body was lying on the bed, just a red, meaty mass in the shape of a human body. His body was flawlessly skinned. 



There was not a single patch of hair or skin left. 



The body must have been left there for a few hours now. The room was filled with a stench of rotting meat.



I could feel my breakfast coming up, but I managed to keep it down.



Jack wiped his mouth off, walked to the door, and shut it.



“What do we do?”



“That thing’s still here. Jack shot at it, but the thing ran away like it was nothing,” Said Oscar.



“Maybe he did kill it,” I added.



“Oh sure, Dave, do you want to go look for it yourself and end up like Captain?”



I didn’t answer.



“We need to call the control tower back on Earth.” John decided.



“What the fuck are they going to tell us? They also have no idea what got on the ship.” Oscar yelled out.



“Shut up, Oscar. The captain's dead, so now I’m the one in charge. We’ll connect with the control station and ask for guidance, and this is a command.” He now spoke with sternness behind his voice.



John then walked to the communication station. Before he could dial the control tower, Oscar grabbed his hand.



“What the fuck are you doing, Oscar?”



“John, John, wait, what if the control station freaks out? You heard the legends of the Astera mission.”



“Oscar, this is not the time for conspiracies, a man is dead on this ship and skinned alive!” John yelled, snapped his hand out, and pressed the call button.



The dial sound echoed through the cockpit. 



Oscar walked back and slumped into his chair. His eyes were watering, his foot nervously shaking.



Then the crackling sound of one of the engineers in the Earth’s control center echoed through the speakers.



“Andromeda, Andromeda. This is Earth, we are receiving your signal.”



“Earth, this is Andromeda. We’re calling with an urgent message. Captain Philips was killed and skinned alive by a strange, unknown creature. 



“The crew engineer shot at it, but it ran away and might still be alive somewhere on this ship.”



“The creature tried to wear the captain's skin and mimic his voice…” 



“We’re asking for your assistance and guidance on what steps we need to take.” 



“Stand by Andromeda.”



Then the engineer put down his headset, but we could still hear a low crackling voice.



A long pause.



“Should we call the general?”



“You know the protocol. I’m dialing his office.”



“Yes, this is the control tower on mission Andromeda calling. Mister General…” 



Another pause.



“It happened again…”



Then we heard the phone put down.



Silence.



Then we heard fast footsteps. Somebody put the headset on.



“Andromeda, Andromeda. This is General Johnson speaking.”



“The risk to Earth’s safety is far too great now. Following protocol, the ship’s controls have been disabled.” 



“The oxygen ventilation will be turned off in an hour.” 



There was hesitation in his voice.



“There are cyanide capsules in the third drawer of the kitchen cabinet… I advise you to take them.”



Then the signal cut out.



“Wha…what? General. General!” Screamed out John, but to no avail. The signal cut out.

  


The words of my old friend echoed through my mind. 



It’s now been ten minutes since we received the damning news. 



Oscar hasn’t stopped crying. Jack is drinking heavily in the cafeteria. John retreated to his cabin. I think he already took the pill with him.



They haven’t turned off the internet, probably as a last act of grace, but all communication apps are inaccessible. 



I was aimlessly clicking through my apps when I noticed I could still access Reddit.



Maybe they forgot to block it, or they didn’t think anyone would believe a strange Reddit post.



If this goes through, please let everyone know what NASA did to us.



“Oxygen 47 minutes.”



Something is crawling through the vents now.



It’s getting better at mimicking the captain's voice.



The last time it spoke, it sounded almost like him.



*Please… don’t let us be forgotten.*
