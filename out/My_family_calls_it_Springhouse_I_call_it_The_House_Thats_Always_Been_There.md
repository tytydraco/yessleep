Have you ever been to a house with a personality?

If you have, you know what I’m talking about.

If you haven’t, you are probably picturing one of those slightly kitsch that their owners call “full of soul”.

But no, I mean one of those houses you can *feel*, you know? One of those houses you can sense in your bones even before you are in front of it.

The type of house that you just *know* it’s strange the moment you walk past it, the one that feel like there is always someone looking at you from one of the windows.

That house that feels like they know you better than you know yourself.

Well, let me tell you, I know one of those houses.

In fact, I grew up next to one… and I feel like my whole life has always been tangled to the same cobwebs that to this day litter those old creaky rooms.

Lately, I’ve felt it’s been sort of calling me, but I find myself unable to go there so, as a strange feeling of nostalgia creeps over me, I’ve decided I should at least share with you some of the events that have occurred within its halls (Although with some changes. I wouldn’t want you people to just up and appear in my house, after all).

So, come closer dear reader and let me tell you about the house I grew up in. The house my mom, and her mom before her, grew up in… the house that’s always been there.

I feel like a good place to begin telling this story, is at the beginning.

Not the house’s beginning, mind you. That’s way before my time and, thus, still irrelevant to the me that lived the experience I’m about to tell.

No, we will go back to my beginnings, to the first strange thing that I remember ever happening while I was visiting the house.

It’s got a name, by the way. Everyone I know calls it *Springhouse*.

Not because the trees around it burst into flowers come spring (though they do), but because the house was built beside a natural spring, one that seeps from a crack in the rock and winds its way downhill toward the lake.

The whole house’s water supply relies on that spring. The house is old like that.

This story takes place during the summer holidays before I turned seven.

For as long as I’ve been alive, Springhouse has belonged to the same person, my great-aunt Gloria. But before her, it was owned by her mother, my great-grandmother Mary. She had two daughters and a son. The eldest inherited the house itself, while the other two each received a plot of land nearby.

My grandparents died too young to ever enjoy the fruit trees she planted, so their inheritance skipped a generation, straight to their only daughter, my mother. Not long after I was born, she built her own place: a small cabin nestled in Springhouse’s shadow.

And I mean that literally. There’s a very specific point in autumn when the shadow of the old house comes to rest right over ours.

The two houses are separated by a piece of land owned by another of my aunts and connected by a narrow strip of forest that runs parallel to the lake, the same lake around which my family has lived for as long as anyone remembers.

Now, Springhouse, as big and cozy as it can be in summer, was not usually the place where everyone gathered for family meetings.  
My mom had an energetic personality, and although she wasn’t one of my great-aunt’s own daughters, Aunt Gloria always considered her one.

So, in the end, everyone ended up spending their summer afternoons in our backyard.

On one of those afternoons, as my dad and uncle worked the barbeque, my great-aunt noticed she’d forgotten to bring a salad bowl. To keep the elderly woman from making the trip through the forest in the encroaching dark, my mom asked *me* to go fetch it.

Let’s just say I wasn’t thrilled about going alone to the house… but I wasn’t about to go against what my mom had asked.

She handed me a flashlight, and off I went, toward Springhouse.

Later (much, much later) my mom told me it had been a sort of rite of passage, something everyone in the family went through at some point in their youth. Everyone, eventually, had been asked to retrieve *something* from Springhouse.

Why, I couldn’t tell you. Especially considering how terrifying the whole thing was for little old me.

Let me set the scene.

The strip of trees wasn’t much of a forest, but it did its job. The moment I stepped into it, the noise of my family grew muffled. A few steps more, and all sound vanished completely.

From my house, if you walk directly south, you’ll reach the lake. But to get to Springhouse, you have to turn left at the old oak tree. It’s huge (taller than any other in that patch of woods) but it’s not always the tree that catches your eye.

Usually, it’s the figure standing beside it.

Long ago, my family had been devout Catholics, though religion has slowly faded from us over the years. Still, back then, they built small grottoes beside the most imposing trees, placing in each a figure of a saint.

The one next to the old oak was the Virgin Mary.

I walked up to it and did the sign of the cross before quickly turning left. The statue was already slightly creepy to me in broad daylight, but under the faint light of the shitty flashlight I had been given (a common thin in the early 2000’s) it was outright terrifying.

I wasn’t catholic, but traditions where hard to kill and I had been taught to do the same whenever I walked past one of the figures since I was little. Even my 31-year-old self still does it from time to time.

I walked up to the statue and made the sign of the cross before quickly turning left. The figure was already a bit creepy to me in broad daylight, but under the faint light of the crappy flashlight I’d been given (a common thing in the early 2000s) it was outright terrifying.

I wasn’t Catholic, but traditions are hard to kill. I’d been taught to do the same whenever I passed one of the figures since I was little. Even my thirty-one-year-old self still does it sometimes, almost out of muscle memory.

I walked in silence along the forest trail, a path carved by hundreds of feet that had walked it before me. The only sound, apart from the leaves crunching under my sneakers, was the steady rustling of branches swaying in the wind that blew from the lake to my right.

The trek wasn’t long, but to six-year-old me, it somehow felt *shorter*… mostly because I dreaded what came next.

The closer you got to Springhouse, the more you began to notice two things. The first was that the trees grew thinner and farther apart, as if they didn’t like standing under the house’s gaze.

The second was the music.

My great-uncle, Aunt Gloria’s husband, had been an engineer. He always said the house was too big for comfort; if something happened to someone at one end, nobody would hear their screams from the other. To fix that, he built a system of intercoms throughout the house. You could talk from one room to another, as if the walls themselves were connected by nerves.

He also built a small radio in the main hall (*built* it, from scraps and car parts) and kept it tuned to the tangos he loved so much. Later, he rigged a small speaker outside, so the beachgoers by the lake could listen too.

It didn’t take long for every part of the system to go haywire.

“The house seems to dislike technology,” he used to say, half in jest, half not.

As you stepped out of the forest, you could hear the music leaking from the broken speaker, the sound warped and watery. Throughout my short life, I saw my great-uncle replace that damned thing four times before giving up entirely.

The tangos took on an eerie tone through the distortion, slow, gurgling, like music played underwater.

And then… you saw the house.

Springhouse is a two-story house built in the shape of an L, the longer arm facing the lake, like it’s keeping watch.

In that face of the house were 14 windows and a porch where the entrance was. Given how tall each plant was, and the fact that the house had been built on top of an equally tall foundation to avoid flooding when the lake grew during winter, the house seemed to always be looking down on the people walking in front of it.

And on that specific night, it felt like that wasn’t just a feeling.

I’ve always dreaded looking up towards those windows. I just knew, and I’m sure some of you will understand, I just knew that someday I would look up and it wouldn’t be just empty windows looking back.

I walked down the path and up the stone staircase towards the closed door of the porch. The warbled sound of the messed-up speaker was slowly overpowered by the sound of the main radio.

A song I knew well was playing, it was my uncle’s favourite. “*Adiós muchachos, compañeros de mi vida.*” Sang Carlos Gardel in his characteristic voice while saying goodbye to his old friends.

Foreboding, I know.

The hall was big, the ceiling was very tall at around 5 meter, but other than the many paintings done by some forgotten great grand-aunts and a small library filled with books, the biggest set piece was the large chandelier hanging in the middle, a big, life-like figure of a bat looking down at me from atop the main lamp.

What compelled my ancestors to hang a lamp like that was and still is beyond my comprehension.

To this day it feels strange to walk beneath the ever-twisting bat which, by some sort of unknown force, always seems to turn the right way to look at you when you try looking at it.

I walked to the opposite side of the room, on the tall doorway next to the staircase that would take you to the upstairs bedrooms. Going out that way into the inner porch and then entering through the door to the right at the other side would be the fastest way to get to the kitchen, but to my little heart’s dismay, I found it closed.

Of course, my great aunt wouldn’t just leave the door to a century old house open for someone to just come in and take whatever they wanted while she feasted on some barbeque pork.

I stood there for a second, unsure of what to do.

It wasn’t that I didn’t know another way to get to the kitchen (Which was at the end of the small arm of the L), but I would have to take the long way there… and that meant going through more badly illuminated rooms.

All the while “*Adios Muchachos*” played in the background.

Wandering alone in that house wasn’t my favourite way to spend my night back then and it still isn’t.

I thought of just going back, telling my mom I hadn’t found the bowl of salad. I knew she wouldn’t say anything, she knew I wasn’t a fan of Springhouse.

But my older cousins where there… and there was no way in hell I was showing any kind of weakness to those assholes.

I grabbed my flashlight (It felt way too heavy in my infantile hands) and I walked back to the middle of the room. Instead of going through the door opposite to the porch, I would have to go through the door to the right of the hall.

The door was heavy. I made a mental note to tell my great-uncle to oil the hinges, though I knew it would make him feel guilty.

He always said he felt like he was fighting a losing battle against the house.  
Every time he fixed one thing, two others broke somewhere else.

I entered the dark room and twisted the light switch at the left side of the door. I could barely reach it, and the dim orange light the one lightbulb hanging in the middle of the tall roof didn’t do much to dissuade my fears, but at least it wasn’t pitch black now.

Are there even light switches that you have to *twist* nowadays? These shitty old things always felt awkward to use, like they had a very specific point they wanted you to reach by twisting them if you wanted to turn on the lights.

And they had the bad habit of untwisting themselves after a while, so if I wanted to come back to a still lit room, I knew I would have to move quickly.

I half ran across the room (the barely used main dinning room that housed the only functioning table in Springhouse that didn’t feel like they had been through a war) and pushed on the door at the other side, moving into the following room.

The Game Room wasn’t original to the house. It was the only modification my great-uncle had managed to do to the house that had stuck.

In the middle of what used to be a guest bedroom filled with bunkbeds (or so I had heard) stood a large pool table. All around the room were cozy sofas and armchairs and a slightly dusty dartboard hung by the only other door in that room, my next objective.

After exiting this room, only two more rooms separated me from the hallway that ended in the kitchen.

Before going through the slightly ajar door, I remember to twist the light switch. The Game Room was the one of only two rooms in Springhouse’s first floor that didn’t feel me with dread, but I still wouldn’t want to come back to it completely unlit.

I entered the next room and tried the switch, but no matter how many times I tried, I was completely unable to turn on the light… which wasn’t completely unexpected, this one room was probably the one I dreaded the most, which in turn was probably messing up my ability to manage the switches.

I stepped further into the daily dining room.

Have you ever been in a ship at sea? I had never been in one, but I always guessed that room felt exactly like one.

The house was old, and during its time it had survived several earthquakes that had managed to level a lot of other old houses… but Springhouse had survived almost unscathed.

Almost.

Over the years, the house had settled, moving on its own foundations and twisting in unexpected ways.

This room, while staying completely functional, had managed to somehow feel like the ways deep at sea.

The aquamarine paint in its walls and the fishing nets hung from the walls didn’t help to ease the feeling either.

I clung onto my flashlight as I stepped further away from the light pouring out of the Game Room.

I didn’t stop to look at the sea glass sitting on the side table or at the totally normal paintings that looked incredibly creepy in the dim light that managed to enter the room.

I just sprinted through the only other door in the room, the one that would take me to the Cup Room, the last room before entering Springhouse’s East Wing.

The Cup room was… small. The ceiling fell dramatically as you entered the East Wing, which, in past times, had been Springhouse’s workers' quarters.

The light was, thankfully, on as I entered. I turned right and walked to the open doorway to the east hallway. At its end, I could see the door I was looking for, the kitchen’s faint light illuminating my objective.

As I walked towards the hallway, I walked past the room’s main attraction, a large piece of furniture filled to the brim with mismatched cups, a collection that had been building for as long as the house had existed.

Some, my great-aunt would say sometimes, were apparently even older than the house itself.

I was sure I could hear the glasses clink as I moved past them, but in my excitement from finally reaching my goal, I decided to… just ignore it.

I ran to the kitchen, sprinting past the workers’ dining room, the large pantry filled with things I didn’t feel like eating, the room my uncle used for his tools and the one my aunt used for the laundry.

I didn’t have to look hard to find the bowl of salad. That damned bowl of salad.

I took the bowl in my arms and spun around quickly. I was sure as fuck I wasn’t staying one more second in Springhouse that night.

I hastily undid my steps and walked to the Cup Room and into the daily dining room. I had been too much in a hurry to notice that I had forgotten my flashlight at the kitchen when I took the salad bowl, and I didn’t realize my mistake until I heard the door creak behind me, clicking closed.

And just like that… I was plunged into a darkness barely broken by the moonlight entering through the blue glass windows.

The door to my right, the one leading to the Game Room, had either closed after I exited the room or the lights had turned off. Either way, everything was eerily quiet and dark inside the dining room…

Yes… quiet.

It was just then that I asked myself something I had been ignoring. “When had the music stopped playing?”

I felt my heartbeat quicken as a shiver ran up my spine. I turned around and tried opening the door. Maybe I could just go out through the Cup Room and just… walk around the house. I didn’t like the idea of walking past all those empty windows at night, but at least outside there was moonlight.

But I didn’t even get to make a choice. The door that I had just walked through… was locked tight.

That’s when I heard a very familiar noise reach my ears.

I say familiar because I was used to listening to it, but in that specific context, it did nothing to quell my fears.

Through the intercoms, I could hear the faint, yet distinct sound of a piano… and someone humming a tune to its tune.

“*Caballito blanco llevame de aqui…*” Sang a voice that was completely alien to my ears. “*Llévame a mi pueblo donde yo nací…*”

I felt a chill run down my spine as I stood there, too scared to even turn around. I was pretty sure the voice wasn’t coming from the speakers… but from somewhere in the dining room.

“*Levántate Juana…*” The voice said, closer than before. “*Y prende la vela, anda a ver quien anda…*”

I felt something rest on my left shoulder. “*En la cabecera*.” I heard the voice whisper… right in my left ear.

My mom would later tell the tale of my scream, which apparently was heard not only all the way back in my house, but was also heard by some other uncle that lived across from the highway and up in the hills.

I don’t remember much other than, after trying to open the door again (Which I had been doing through the whole fucking ordeal to no avail) it finally opened and I sprinted like a madman carrying a bowl of salad all the way back to my house.

After my mom had managed to calm me down a bit, she asked me what had happened.

Between sobs I managed to tell everyone what had happened.

I half expected my cousins to laugh at me for crying, but I remember none of them did.

“Oh, that’s aunt Martha.” Said my great-aunt as if speaking of something as obvious as water. “She did always like to scare kids that walked around Springhouse past their bedtime.”

After that whole thing, I refused to step into Springhouse alone for a full year. Not even during daytime.
