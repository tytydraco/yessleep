I don’t usually post stuff like this. I don’t even use reddit much except to scroll when I can’t sleep. But lately, I’ve been waking up around 3 or 4 in the morning, just knowing something’s outside my window.

So maybe writing it out will help. Maybe someone here has gone through something like this.

This all started last winter, around mid-December. My cousin Nate had this idea to go stay at his family’s old hunting cabin up by Lake Superior. His dad built it in the late ‘80s, but nobody had used it in years. He said it would be a “digital detox weekend,” no internet, barely any phone use, we only brought our phones for emergencies, just a wood stove, some beer, and a couple days of peace and quiet.

I was hesitant because the timing sucked, roads were icy, snowstorms every few days, but Nate wouldn’t shut up about it. Said he needed to clear his head after his breakup and that I owed him one for missing his birthday. So I said screw it.

The drive up was worse than either of us expected. The last few miles were all winding forest road, barely plowed, no cell service. Snow was falling in thick sheets, and the trees looked like black walls on both sides. Every now and then we’d see a deer dart through the headlights and vanish into the dark, and both of us would flinch.

By the time we got to the cabin, it was almost 9 p.m. The place was buried halfway up the porch in snow. No footprints, no tire tracks, just untouched white. Inside smelled like damp wood and animal piss. The first thing we noticed was the cold. Not regular cold, it felt wrong somehow, heavier, like it didn’t belong inside.

We got the generator going, thank God it still worked, and the little place started to warm up. Nate cracked a beer, joked about how we were “real mountain men” now. We played a few hands of cards, made some soup on the propane stove, and eventually passed out on the fold-out couch.

I don’t know what time it was when I woke up. The generator had stopped, everything was quiet. Not peaceful quiet. Dead quiet. Like the air itself had stopped moving.

I remember sitting up and instantly getting this feeling that something was wrong. I couldn’t explain it. My body just knew.

When I went outside to restart the generator, my flashlight caught something in the snow, a trail of prints circling the cabin. Barefoot. Human-shaped but off somehow. The toes were longer, the stride uneven, like whoever made them had been dragging one leg. They went all the way around the cabin and disappeared into the woods.

I woke Nate up. He stumbled outside with me, half-asleep, swearing I was overreacting, until he saw them himself. He crouched down to look closer, and I swear I saw his breath catch when he realized how deep they went. Like whoever made them weighed a lot.

We locked the doors, piled some firewood in front of the entrance, and tried to pretend it was fine. We barely slept.

The next morning the snow had stopped, but the air felt heavier. There was this strange smell, not quite rot, not quite metal, but sharp enough to burn in your nose. We ate a quick breakfast and decided to leave early. But when we went outside, the truck wouldn’t start.

The battery wasn’t just dead, it was gone. Like it had been pulled out cleanly. The weirdest part? The hood wasn’t even damaged. The latch was still locked, like something had just lifted it open. There were drag marks in the snow leading off toward the trees.

He grabbed a hatchet from the shed and said he was going to follow the tracks, just a little way. I told him not to, that we should stay put until someone found us. But he was stubborn like that. He didn’t come back.

I waited for maybe twenty minutes before I went after him. There were new prints now, his mixed with the others. I followed them about twenty yards before the trees got thicker and the light dimmed. Then I noticed the smell again. Stronger this time.

Something was hanging from a branch ahead, part of Nate’s flannel sleeve, torn clean off. And below it, the snow was soaked dark.

At least, it looked like blood. Later, when the snow melted and refroze, it was gone, maybe that’s why the search team didn’t find any sign of it, but in that moment, it was enough to make me freeze in place.

That’s when I heard him. Or at least, I thought it was him.

He said my name, soft at first, then louder. It sounded like it was coming from deeper in the woods, but the echo didn’t sound right. It was like the voice was inside my head instead of around me.

Nate had shouted my name earlier when he left, so at first I thought maybe he was still close. I called back, but there was only silence. Then I saw it.

It was standing between two trees, hunched but still taller than any person should be. Its skin was stretched tight, grayish, and thin enough to show ribs. The head looked human at first, but the jaw was too long, like it had been broken and never healed. When it opened its mouth, I could see black around its gums, and something wet and red dripping from the corners.

It stepped forward, and the sound it made wasn’t footsteps. It was more like cracking branches inside the snow.

I don’t remember running, but I must have. I just remember the feeling of my lungs tearing apart in the cold air, and the moment I saw the road, a narrow stretch of white cutting through the trees. I didn’t stop until I hit pavement, maybe two miles away.

When I finally got to a gas station, I called the sheriff’s office. They told me the roads were blocked by fallen trees and they couldn’t get a plow up there until the storm cleared. They sent a team two days later, once it was finally passable. They found the cabin. They found the truck. They found Nate’s phone, frozen and half-buried about a mile from the property. But no Nate. No blood trail. Nothing else.

They said maybe a bear got him. I didn’t argue.

That was eight months ago.

I’ve moved three times since then. Different cities, different apartments. I don’t tell people why. I don’t even tell my family the full story, they think I’m still dealing with trauma and making things up in my head. Maybe they’re right.

But sometimes I wonder if it followed my scent, or if I brought something back from that place without realizing it.

Two nights ago, I woke up around 3:47 a.m.

Someone was whispering my name from the hallway.

I live alone.

When I finally got the courage to look, the whispering stopped. But right under my bedroom window, on the patch of frozen mud, there were footprints. Barefoot. Human shaped.

And just slightly too long.

Like the same ones from that night in the snow, perfectly preserved, like whatever made them hadn’t walked here.

It had just appeared.
