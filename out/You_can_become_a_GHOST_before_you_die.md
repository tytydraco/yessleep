I was a writer once, and this was the last lines I had jotted down before going into the water

I draw your lines thin
Thick as thieves
You deceived me

...I was pretending for a lifetime and that did nothing real except send me into the ocean.
I can outsmart the currents.
The riptides.
I welcomed the tsunamis,
and all that they left behind.
I was hoping I would see you in the water, and I did.
Thrashing about, desperately grabbing for something to hold onto.
I came up from the water, it carries me mostly where I want to go, but sometimes where I need to.
"Take my hand" I instructed.
"Where did you come from?" I'm sure he would have seemed confused if it weren't for the water flowing into his body. Nothing sent him here. He needed air.
I didn't answer, but he grabbed my hand.

My touch breathed life back into him. We swam towards a stable structure, more or less, still touching. The second we hit land, he dropped my hand. I stayed in the treacherous waters, for they had become my friend, my home.
"Thank you" he mustered in between coughing fits. Water must have still gotten in. A girl can only do so much.
"If I could tell you how, would you stay, here, with me, in the water?"
"I cant."
"Why is that? All you have to do is pretend?"
"I never had to pretend you loved me. I never had to pretend I loved you. I never had to pretend I love her. If I was sent into the ocean, I wouldn't be able to breathe"
"I always did welcome all that the tsunamis left behind, all the wisdom in the sea. I wish I had left you sooner."

"You tried. That's why I killed you. And that's why I'm not allowed to be with you in the water, only those who died in it can stay." I chuckled. 
"I suppose that's why I can't be on land, I guess after you killed me in the water you ate the lunch I laced with cyanide." I paused. 
"What about the women you also loved?"
"Oh, her? She went into the air"
"Did you kill her too?" 
"Yes. But she never pretended. You could have saved her, you know? You could have told her who I was. It's a clich√© really, all three of us dying. Kind of a predictable story if you ask me." 
"Agreed, no plot twist there." 
It made sense why I was only able to breathe in the water. It made sense why he could only breathe on land, (yes, the dead breathe, but not in the way you think, and not something the living could ever comprehend). 

"So...she can only breathe when she is in air?" Of course I hate my husband for cheating on me, killing me, and making me kill him, but he seemed to have answers that I don't, so I played complacent (as per usual). 
"Yes."
"Soo...you killed her midair?" I rolled my eyes, as if being dead for eternity in water wasn't bad enough, now I have to play 20 questions with my idiotic husband (ex husband??). 

"No, I think she went to heaven."
