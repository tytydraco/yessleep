The ringing in my ears finally subsided. You’d think then I’d be able to enjoy my sleep more but I feel even worse now. What time is it?


Thud 


I hit the ground hard. My mind was blank but clearly my body knew better. I’ve overslept.


“Fuck! Really!”


I hurriedly force myself up and I struggle to not trip over myself, sifting through the clothes lying around I struggled to find something to wear. As I rush to my car my limbs still refusing to coordinate I struggle to find my keys. I rush back inside cursing myself for not just leaving the keys in the usual spot and finally make my way out of the driveway. I hate driving, especially without music but what choice did I have? Fortunately or unfortunately I arrive at the parking lot and easily find myself a spot. That’s unusual. Now’s not the time to think though I’m late for work. 


“Hey, Paris, quit running will ya.”


I did not want to deal with this right now. 


“Paris!”


A firm hand took the grasp of my shoulder. I knew exactly who it was, why on the other hand I have no clue. Even a guy like him who just slides by should still have enough sense to arrive at work on time.


“L-let go, man, I am not trying to be any later than I already am!”


“I wouldn’t bother, just take a look around.”


Begrudgingly I did and then I noticed how many of us there were still lingering in the parking lot. It was already a quarter past nine. How had so many of us come in this late?


“What’s going on?”


“Not too sure myself, all I know is apparently the guy who owns this whole office building just sold the property and whichever dickwod is in charge just laid off the entire crew.”


I really did not want to deal with this right now.


“You cannot be for real.”


“It’s as real as I can get brother, I wouldn’t bother going, you can get your stuff from the cubicles but apart from that all they do is make you sign a bunch of paperwork. If I had known I’d have fucked off to the bar ages ago.”


“Oh my god…”


Rubbing my temples I just stood there eyes closed. I didn’t want to even think about how I’d go about getting another job let alone how I was going to pay my upcoming electricity bill. I guess my body didn’t react well either as I stumbled backwards. 


“Woah! You okay man?”


“Not. At. All.”


“Shit man, want a smoke? Or sum’.” He pulled out his red lighter and tried to hand it to me. I knew he was trying to help but man, did I want to kill him. 


“God damnit, Vincent… I told you I quit smoking months ago…”


“My fault brother…”


As I released myself from his grip I simply stood there watching as poor soul after poor soul  was unceremoniously released from their office duty. 


——


Sigh 


What was I doing here? I don’t really frequent bars but even I could tell this one was particularly shoddy. Perhaps it was the clientele or the fact that despite being 22 I had the frame of a 16 year old boy and they didn’t look twice before letting me in. As I sat at a table with shitty beer in hand I looked so out of place as I faced that hooligan across from me. 


“Nothing like a cold one right after being laid off!”


“Why does it feel like you’re celebrating…” I don’t know what I was thinking but clearly I didn’t think it through.


“Come on kid, I invited you for a beer, at least act a little happy.”


“I just got laid off!…. You did too!” The sudden raise in my voice made me self conscious of my surroundings. I retreated into the booth silently sipping my beer. 


“It’s not so bad, besides there’s no way that’s fully legal. I mean they got rid of everyone. I didn't see a single person not tossed out like yesterday’s trash.”


“So what you wanna sue?”


“Maybe… but nah screw that I’m sure one of the other higher up guys will. But I have an idea in mind.”


His lips turned upwards as he finished his sentences. It felt like I was about to be snaked into a deal, with a horrid interest rate.


“No, whatever it is, I'm not doing it.”


“Then give me your card, I can go in myself.”


I still had my security card. I cursed myself for being surprised, he would do this.


“As if! they’d kick you out in a second!”


“Weren’t you listening!”


I was not. 


“…everyone is gone even the fucking janitor.”


“What does breaking in even help with?”


“The dickwods witheld my damn bonus! I’m not waiting for a check to come in the mail 6 months later. I want it now! I’ll even pay you some!”


As the waiter brought us our meager bills we pulled out our wallets. His was noticeably bigger. 


Bzt 


A notification on my phone? Oh god it was just around that time. The end of the month was coming and in turn bills. I have a horrible poker face. Vince knew that all too well and as he stared,smiling gleefully, he spoke. 


“So we have a deal.”


“Mannn…...”


——


No matter how much I lamented my situation I hardly had any tact to pull out now. I felt ridiculous wearing some oversized black jacket and ski mask that reeked of cigarette smoke. Walking up to the back door I was shaking. Looking around I expected to be caught easily but as I frantically scanned and rescanned my surroundings no one stared back. Everyone really was gone.


“Hand me the card.”


I did as told and as the door beeped it unlocked and we hurried inside. I already wanted to call it quits but  Vince spared no time in ascending the steps. Not wanting to be left behind I followed. I followed for quite a while in fact. An alarming amount of time passed as we ascended the steps. 


“Hey sh-shouldn’t we be there by now! I mean we  only worked on the fourth floor…”


“Beats me, the elevator works way better than stairs.”


“I’m being serious here!”


“Well this is the back entrance, who knows besides we’ll be there eventually we have until morning maybe even longer.”


I did not want to be here long. Despite working in this place for over a year, something about being here now felt invasive. Of course it did, we were breaking in but I felt much more like a virus than a thief but before I could lay my grievances a door appeared. Conveniently enough it was the fourth. 


As I opened the door I was relieved to see that at first glance it looked completely normal. It was a bit creepy with the lights off but that wouldn’t be an issue. 


“Make sure not to flash these lights through the windows.”


I creeped my way forward like some kind of dog in an awkward crawl but Vince neglected to conceal himself.


“Maybe you should crawl too? I mea- !! Is the crowbar necessary!!“


“Just in case, kid. Can’t be too careful.”


He was all too confident in his plan. Unfortunately despite our constant pace it seemed like we were getting nowhere. We paced the cubicles but no matter how fast we went there always seemed to be an insurmountable gap between us and wherever Vince’s destination was. 


“What the fuck!”


I was about ready to curse the whole building too but before I could get a word in my ears picked up on something.


Click Click 


“…”


Tap tap tap


Someone had been left behind after all. 


“Turn off your light.”


As I did we sat there in the dark but as our eyes adjusted we could see a faint light a little bit aways to the right. 


“Isn’t that Jared’s cubicle?”


“I have no clue at this point…”


“He’s got to have some idea of what’s going on.”


Somehow I doubted this was true.


“Why don’t we turn on the lights or better yet maybe we can leave.”


“Not yet, those dickwods can’t get rid of me that fast.”


I half expected us to not be able to close the distance but I guess the building had no issue with us slowly closing into the only cubicle in use. Peeking into the cubicle I saw a plain sight. A balding man sitting at a desk, not too uncommon in an office but clearly something wasn’t right.


“Jared? The hell you still here for.”


He didn’t respond, his fingers still typing away but the computer screen was completely dark. 


“Come on man?” As if greeting an old friend he pat Jared on the back. It made a disgustingly wet sound.


“Jared! The fuck you still here for man!”


Uaghhh


He groaned. In one swift motion Vince knocked the chair over but Jared didn’t fall off.


“What the fuck!”


We looked in awe at the impossibility before us. The chair almost seemed alive as it clung tightly to Jared's body. Like some kind of horrific surgery had taken place it looked like his flesh was now part of the chair.


“Holy shit! We have to go man! We have to call the cops!”


“You stupid! Then we’ll get arrested! Let’s just fucking go, someone gon’ found out in the morning.” 


We ran and ran and ran. I felt like I had run a marathon but no matter how hard we sprinted we weren’t getting any closer to the exit door. I could feel the panic in my chest as my heart threatened to burst. We stopped for a moment but the building didn’t let us rest.  


Aughhh Aughhh 


The building came alive. As an alarm straight from hell  assaulted our ears the cubicles morphed into horrific nightmare inducing halls. I almost tripped over myself as the floor softened into a grotesque view. The once white walls were now pink and fleshy. As I breathed I felt as if I were stuck in a pile of raw meat. Our jaws fully gapped, we just stared in awe, but the building wasn’t finished.  


“What the hell!!!”


It looked and felt like hell but what snapped me out of its trance was a slimy feeling caressing me. We took off hard not considering where this labyrinth might lead.


“What the fuck touched me!”


“It was the damn floor!”


I dared not look back. I feared I would see the floor come alive like a graveyard with hands sticking out from every direction. 


“The windows! Find the windows!”


I think deep down we both knew that there was no chance the building would let us out but it didn’t give us a reason to stop. I heard screeching from just down the hall. I didn’t want to see that abomination again. 


We ran hard, fast, recklessly without a thought. Every unfamiliar sensation threatened to burst my beating heart. Adrenaline coursed through our veins but in time it crashed. Without energy. Without hope. We slowed to a jog. Then to a crawl. 


“I-I don’t wanna die….”


Vince didn’t say a word but I could feel his mouth scowling at me. As I turned to my side I saw him pull out a small red lighter from his pocket. 


Uuaghhh


It wasn’t too long before that abomination that could no longer be called Jared came around the corner. 


“Wh-what the fuck did they do to you! Answer me you punk!”


We both knew he wouldn’t respond. Instead as he slowly lurched forward Vince used the lighter. Jared was set ablaze and the smell of smoldering flesh seared my nostrils. My eyes teary and my senses in overload I could hear the ground groan and shake as if it were breathing beneath me. I feared I may be swallowed for daring to stand up to it but as if some sort of miracle. The space behind us opened up to reveal the windows. Beyond them, our logical world.


“Vince! The windows!”


He snapped back and as he did he grabbed the crow bar. He ran towards the windows, as he did he sunk slowly into the ground. He struggled as what seemed like hands rose from every direction to latch onto him like some hellish trap. 


“Paris! Help me!”


I was petrified. 


“Paris!”


Vince threw the crowbar. It easily shattered a small hole into the glass. As he struggled forward he lifted a hand out. I wanted to grab onto it. I wanted to help him. But as I regained sensation I could feel the ground caress me.


I didn’t want to leave him behind. I didn’t want to subject him to that abhorrent nightmare. But what could I do? I, a meager human, I was no match for the building, it felt like it was simply toying with me. 


I jumped.


He screamed horribly but it was soon stuffed by the sound of moving flesh. Crashing into an open dumpster I quickly got out but as I looked back nothing but concrete walls were staring back. At first I was happy. I was simply mad! This was just a bad trip. That good for nothing probably spiked my drink! I wished so badly for that to be the case but the building had given me a parting gift. 


“Woah! Uh, I-I mean how can I help you tod-“


“Pack of Marlboro...”


“Y-Yeah uh that’ll be 8.99$…. Can I see I.D.”


“…”


“Never mind you have a good day…”


I hadn’t smoked in ages.

I stared straight ahead, I paid no mind to the going’s on around me as I lit the cigarette with Vince’s red lighter.
