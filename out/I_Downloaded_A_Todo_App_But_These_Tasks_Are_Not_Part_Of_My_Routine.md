My life has always been a mess. Well, as far back as I can remember, my room is almost a black hole of clothes and books, and my schedules are even worse, with breakfasts at 8 PM and dinners at 3 PM. That said, I decided it was time to try to change these habits. Now that college is over and I've landed a steady job, it wouldn't just be good but also necessary to change this aspect.

In a conversation with a friend, he told me about this category of apps that aim to simplify routines by offering the possibility to add "tasks" with reminders and all. I confess I found the idea very promising. I'm not messy by choice or anything; it's simply a matter of forgetfulness, and perhaps downloading one of these could solve the issue.

So, following his advice, I decided to look for a task list app in my phone's app store. There were some more minimalist ones, others with an "RPG" vibe, giving you "XP" and items for completing tasks. Don't get me wrong, but I'm not that much of a nerd. Just when I was about to give up due to indecision, a pop-up appeared in the corner, an ad for an app called "TaskMaster Pro." The ad read:

"Transform your life with TaskMaster Pro! Organize your routine, achieve your goals, and reach the success you've always wanted."

Intrigued and a little desperate for a solution, I clicked on the ad and was directed to the download page. The app had a clean and modern interface, with positive reviews and a promising description. I decided to give it a chance and downloaded the TaskMaster app.

Upon opening the app, I was greeted by a simple tutorial that guided me through creating my first task list. I tried to start with the basics, so I opened it and entered the objectives:

- Wake up (8:00 AM)

- Go to the gym (9:00 AM)

- Work (10:00 AM)

- Lunch (1:00 PM)

- Study (3:00 PM)

- Dinner (7:00 PM)

- Read (9:00 PM)

- Sleep (11:00 PM)

It seemed like a good start. Satisfied with the list, I closed the app and went on with my day, hoping that organizing my life would significantly improve it. I woke up to the alarm at exactly 8 AM. The day went on like this, with tasks buzzing in the notifications, and I completed them. To my surprise, it was very effective. That day had been the most productive in who knows how long. I slept like a baby that night and woke up even more refreshed the next morning. Thus, a few days passed, and I began to "mold" into the routine, and indeed, I was pleased with the app.

But something happened, a week after I had installed it: I was doing my nightly reading, almost finishing "The Shining," when my phone's ringtone made me jump out of my chair. Even with the screen locked, I could see it was a TaskMaster notification. "Strange," I thought, "It's not bedtime yet." I picked up my phone, curious about this, and opened the app, my anticipation building as the blue background with white letters indicated the app was starting up.

The screen lit up and displayed the task list as expected, but when my eyes scrolled to the bottom, I choked. I froze as I read:

Do not look back (9:45 PM)

I stood still for a few moments, staring at those words. What the hell was this? Some kind of prank? A tasteless joke? I don't know. But there's something almost intuitive when you receive an order. Ever heard of the Milgram experiment? Well, it's like that. The truth is, it made me tense, VERY tense, especially as I remembered that behind the chair where I was sitting was the window to my backyard. I could feel tiny droplets of sweat forming on my forehead, and I was alert, trying to hear any noise coming from there, but I heard nothing, just dead silence.

"Take a deep breath," I thought. Maybe it was some kind of app glitch or a tasteless joke. I tried to convince myself of this as I got up from the chair, trying to ignore the chill running down my spine.

I turned off the office light, still not looking back, and left through the door, closing it behind me. I walked to the bedroom, trying to distract myself with positive thoughts and stall until bedtime. I lay down in bed, picked up my book, and tried to resume reading. However, I couldn't get that mysterious task out of my head. What would happen if I looked back? It was just a silly task, but for some reason, it had unsettled me like no other had before.

I tried to convince myself there was nothing to fear and that it was all just a bug or a prank. After a while, I managed to calm down and focus on the reading again, although the curiosity was still there, nudging me. When the app finally buzzed again, this time showing it was bedtime, I turned off the bedroom light and prepared to close my eyes. That's when curiosity won. "Just a quick look," I thought.

I went downstairs, my heart racing as I approached the office and my eyes met the window. The moonlight illuminated the backyard, revealing shadows moving with the wind. Nothing but the rustling of branches. I laughed at myself, thinking how silly I had been. I went back up to the bedroom and continued with my night's sleep.

The next morning came with a feeling of relief mixed with a lingering discomfort. I opened the app, and the list was as usual, except for a new category: Uncompleted Tasks. Beside it was yesterday's text with a red X next to it. Below, it displayed the message:

"You chose not to follow one of our tasks. Consistency is key to success. We recommend you keep your commitment to future tasks to achieve your goals."

I don't know, it was a standard message but still... I felt threatened, fearful. I proceeded cautiously to work, and gradually, I managed to forget about it, and the day passed normally. I finished my shift, and as soon as I got into my car, my phone rang.

It was a notification from TaskMaster Pro. With a sigh, I unlocked the phone and read the message:

"Run the red light."

My heart raced, and a sense of panic took over me. What the hell was happening? This couldn't be real; it was dangerous and illegal!

I tried to ignore the message and kept driving, keeping my eyes on the road and trying to push away the disturbing thoughts. But the notification persisted, and I could feel the pressure mounting.

I reached a red light, and the app alerted me again. "You have a pending task: Run the red light." I was sweating cold, my stomach twisted with anxiety. I looked around, and there was no movement. I decided to follow the task and sped up. To my surprise, just as I had run the light, a massive tree branch fell right where I had been moments before. Had I not run the light, it would have surely hit me...

I parked the car in a safe spot and opened TaskMaster Pro, wanting to understand better what was going on. The task list had been updated:

Run the red light (Completed)

Thank TaskMaster Pro (Completed)

But what? I was definitely immersed in this now; it was the only thing I could think about. Was it magic? Something like that? When I got home, I read some comments on the app's page to see if anyone else had a similar situation, but to my surprise, the app had disappeared from the stores, in fact, from the entire internet.

I continued with the tasks but now compulsively checking the phone until reading time when, once again, a notification appeared to rob me of sleep:

"Check under the bed before sleeping (10:00 PM)"

This time I felt even more uncomfortable. My heart pounded like a drum in my chest, pumping adrenaline through a shiver down my spine. I decided to get it over with. With each step towards my room, the tension grew. Every dark corner seemed to hide something sinister. I approached the bed, took a deep breath once more, and bent down to check underneath it. Nothing. A temporary relief washed over me, but the fear was still there, pulsing in my veins. When I opened the app again, the task list was there, with the new task marked as "Completed."

Things continued this way for the rest of the week, but today... well, today the situation got a little worse. I was coming home from work when a notification arrived:

"Open the front door and stand still for five minutes (6:30 PM)"

My stomach twisted with growing fear. What should I do? I parked the car and walked up to the door. My hand was sweating as I touched the cold doorknob. I turned it and pushed, opening the door to reveal the empty, dark interior of the house. I almost stepped in automatically but remembered the task. Not just that, but what could happen if I didn't follow it. I decided to stay there, standing. What harm could come from it? I glanced at the clock, 6:30 PM on the dot. I stood there, trying to distract myself by counting the numbers mentally.

It hadn't been more than 2 minutes when I heard something behind me, like footsteps on the grass, but in a way I can't explain, they didn't sound normal, not like a person walking. It was less rhythmic, stranger, as if there were more than two legs. My eyes widened, and my heart raced. Fear took over me, paralyzing me. The shadows danced on the floor in the dim light of late afternoon, but nothing was there. The silence was deafening, broken only by the sound of my own heart pounding in my ears.

Time seemed to stand still. Every second felt like an eternity. I tried to stay calm, telling myself that all of this was just my imagination or some kind of strange coincidence and that, anyway, it was better to obey the app; now there was just over a minute left. However, the footsteps grew louder, approaching me, until I noticed that whatever it was, it was standing right beside me; I could hear and feel its breath on my neck, a cold breath.

This was real. A chill ran down my spine, and I felt my body freeze. The clock struck 6:35 PM. Finally, the five minutes had passed. With a quick movement, I ran inside the house and locked the door behind me without even looking back, trembling with fear and relief at the same time. I risked a peek through the peephole, but I saw nothing but the empty street bathed in twilight. I took a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart.

I was tense, checking the doors and windows of the house when the phone rang again, and, by God, I had to restrain myself:

"You're almost there. Now, look up. (7:15 PM)"

My breath caught. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I felt pinned to the ground. My peripheral vision could see something large, a black figure hanging from the ceiling, but I didn't dare look. When it made the slightest movement, I ran, ran like I never had before, up the stairs, three, maybe four steps at a time, and locked myself in the bedroom, panting and terrified. I leaned against the door, trying to catch my breath and process what was happening.

The silence in the room was almost deafening, only the sound of my rapid breathing filled the air. I was locked in, but whatever it was seemed to be outside, hovering around the house, waiting. The shadows moved strangely under the door, as if they were alive, and I could hear a soft, almost inaudible whisper echoing behind the wood.

I was there, leaning against the door, trying to gather the courage to look at my phone again, at the cursed app that had brought all this terror into my life. I picked up the trembling phone and opened TaskMaster Pro, expecting to see some new terrifying instruction, some task that demanded another madness, but to my surprise, there was nothing. I called my brother asking him to come over, that was about 5 minutes ago, just before I started typing this. I don't know if that thing left, but I just received one last notification from the app, and it says:

"Sweet Dreams (7:30 PM)"
