The name is Alice Marshall. And I thought I was the only one with a paranormal past.

I'm a tattoo artist working in downtown. I stay at cheap studio apartment in the sketchy part of the city. One night while running some errands, I encountered a girl digging through the trash behind the building.

I took sympathy over her, being an orphan myself, and decided to let her stay with me. I asked her name to which she said:

"Maribel."

"That's an ugly name."

"Hey!" She softly punched my arm. "At least I got both eyes," she pointed at the black bandage wrapped around my right eye.

"The less of your ugly face I gotta see the better," I playfully pushed her inside.

She was deadly afraid of mirrors. Refused to enter any room with them. I had a big fear of light myself so who am I to judge.

I removed all mirrors but left one in my room, which I didn't let her know about.

Throughout the nights, I started seeing the same black cat appear above our dumpster, crawling under the light. I paid it no attention and headed upstairs.

As I approached the door, I heard Maribel scream. I desperately unlocked it and burst in. Maribel was being dragged along the floor by an invisible force.

I reached to grabbed her but stumbled back when I felt a boney claw slice through my arms. It dragged her into my room and towards the mirror. That's when I saw it. Or them.

The creature's body although invisible, reflected against the mirror. Tall and skinny, red flesh and no eyes. Long claws wrapped themselves around Maribel's shoulders.

A maid in black and white outfit, and vibrant red hair waited on the other side. She glanced over to me and smiled.

I lunged myself towards Maribel and grabbed hold of her hands. I pulled her away as she kicked the creature back. The maid snickered.

Maribel held tightly onto my shirt while I snatched her up and rushed to the door. The door swung open to reveal my neighbor standing in the entrance.

His eyes completely black with an uncanny smile, "Alice. Alice. Alice. Oh Alice. You thought you were free?"

"Who is that, Alice?" Maribel turned to him then to me.

I shut off the light and stepped into the other room. My neighbor stood by the door, waiting. A loud crash was heard from the hallway as I locked the door and stood by the dark corner with Maribel.

"What do we do?"

"Shut up and let me think," I sat Maribel on her bed.

The creature started slashing away at the door, trying to break it down.

"What is that thing and why does it want you!"

"Andrea calls it a Knight."

"Who?"

"The girl in the mirror."

"The maid? What does she want with you?"

Our conversation was cut short when the creature finally broke down the door. Couldn't see it approach me but I did hear its' footsteps getting closer. I felt a sharp pain in my stomach as it ripped through my shirt and flesh.

Falling to the ground, I saw as Maribel was lifted into the air and seemingly floated away. I crawled to her, all while my neighbor comes into the apartment pointing a flashlight to his face as his shadow engulfed the ceiling.

He grabbed my hair and pulled me towards him. I swung my leg across his, causing him to let go and drop the flashlight. The flashlight landed on the floor, aiming at Maribel.

Maribel who been screaming the whole time, went silent as the light hit her. Her pupils dilated until her eyes went black.

She let out a cackle and rammed her fingernails into the invisible creature. Dark red blood, nearly black, appeared in mid-air. It flowed down the creature's back exposing its' once transparent body.

The creature dropped Maribel who hit the ground with a loud thud. I caught the creature's reflection once more in the mirror as it jumped through. Andrea shook her head and walked away.

Maribel stared back at me with her black eyes. I quickly snatched up the flashlight and turned it off. Maribel's eyes returned to normal as she fell onto her back. I then got up and smashed the mirror against the ground, shattering it.

For the remainder of the night I held Maribel in my arms. She eventually woke up and smiled. As did my neighbor who I escorted to his apartment and found a dead black cat lying in his floor.

The next morning while I made breakfast, Maribel explained her story of finding an old mirror in her attic, and how Andrea tricked her into doing horrible things. She escaped so Andrea sent out these hideous creatures who only showed up in the mirrors, after her.

Taking my turn to explain, I told her about Barry, my old teddy bear friend who I discovered was a sentient shadow who possessed people and objects when under any light source.

Maribel then asked, "Do you think there's other monsters out there?"

"I don't know. But I won't let any of them get to [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBatBelfry/s/S8h2U8QlOw)."
