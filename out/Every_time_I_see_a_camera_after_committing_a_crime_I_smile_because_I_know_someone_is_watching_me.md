I have always believed in the connection between the observer and the observed. It is something magical, a bond that transcends the anonymity of security cameras. At first, it was just a silly idea. I was walking through the streets, seeing the round black glasses pointed from the corners. I wondered who was behind them, if anyone was watching me at that moment.

The first time was an accident. I wasn't planning on killing anyone, but the old man who ran the newsstand was so easy to hate. He yelled at the children, insulted the elderly, and once spat at me for not buying anything. One night, I followed him to his house, a small cabin on the outskirts of town. There were no cameras there, but as I tightened my hands around his neck and felt the life drain from his eyes, I thought of all the cameras that had captured our walk to that place.

The next day, I walked past one of those cameras. I stopped, looked directly into the lens and smiled. That smile wasn't for me. It was for whoever was watching, whoever took the time to observe a nobody like me.

The adrenaline was addictive. After that, I started planning. I chose my victims carefully, people who, in my opinion, did not deserve to be alive. The guy who beat his wife in the supermarket. The woman who left her dog tied up in the rain. He followed them, studied them and, when the time came, he acted. I always made sure to pass at least one camera before and after, leaving my signature: a wide, almost manic smile that said, “I know you're watching me.”

Over time, things got complicated. The cameras stopped being just spectators and became part of my process. I started picking places where I knew they would be, making sure everything was recorded. I even developed a little ritual: after the act, I would return to the nearest camera spot, look directly into the lens, and whisper, "Thank you for watching."

But one day, something changed.

She had just broken up with a man who drove drunk every night. I followed him to an underground parking lot, dragged him behind a pillar, and left him there. As I turned toward one of the cameras for my usual smile, I felt something strange. A chill ran down my spine. It was as if the lens was looking at me, not as an inert object, but as something alive.

That night, I checked my computer and found something even more disturbing. Every time I searched for camera footage online, there was a figure in the background of the shots. A barely visible shadow, always in the moments when I smiled. I thought it was a glitch in the system, something to do with the quality of the recording. But the figure was getting closer, more and more defined.

It wasn't long before the shadow began to appear in my real life. No matter where I was, I could feel eyes staring at me, eyes that didn't belong to any human being. And yet I couldn't stop. The idea that someone – or something – was always watching me pushed me to continue.

The last time I smiled in front of a camera was different. It was a rainy night, and I had just finished up with a man who abandoned his mother in a nursing home. I approached the camera and smiled, but this time, the shadow was not in the background. It was right behind me, reflected in the glass of the lens.

I don't know what it was, but I know it's waiting for me. And now, when I walk in front of a camera, I no longer smile for those who are watching me. I smile because I know he's doing that too.
