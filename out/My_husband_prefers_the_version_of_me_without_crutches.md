Two weeks after the running accident, I was still on crutches. They were surprisingly loud, making a *clack, clack, clack* every time they hit the floor. I couldn’t walk a step without them, so when I hobbled to the bathroom in the middle of the night, they clacked and clattered along with me. I could only hope I didn’t wake my husband.

I used the bathroom, keeping the light off in hopes of falling back asleep easily. Down the hallway I heard something: a muffled *clack, clack, clack* from behind the closed den door*.* Like my son was playing with my crutches, but that was impossible. 

Maybe I was hearing things, still half-asleep. I hoisted myself onto the crutches and limped down the hallway, hoping the noise would go away. It didn’t. In fact, the clacking seemed to match the beat my own crutches were making as I walked toward it. 

When I paused before the den, the noise stopped. I turned to go back to the bedroom with a sigh of relief, ready to forget this had ever happened.

But I made it only one step before I heard another *clack* behind me, an exact echo of my own.

I turned back and pushed open the door.

And there, in the den, dimly silhouetted by the old lamp, was Me. A perfect copy. 

She also had crutches, wore the same bewildered expression I’m sure I had. The same nightclothes and leg cast. 

I was frozen. So was She. I raised a hand to my chest, breathless. So did She. I took a startled step back, and, in perfect unison, so did She. I could have been looking in a mirror. 

We stared at one another. Every tiny movement I made, every trembling breath, was matched by Her exactly, all while looking me right in the eye.

A rush of adrenaline fighting off sleep left me with no coherent thoughts. I could only stare, mouth agape and heart racing. 

It was She who made the first move when her crutches fell, one by one, to the floor. 

Across the room, She smiled and charged at me in a full-on sprint. I ducked out of Her way at the last minute, dropping my own crutches in the process. I heard Her run down the hallway, beginning to scream and cry in my own voice, “someone’s here! Someone’s in the house!”

I made it to the bedroom a full minute after her, barely able to walk without my crutches but driven by animalistic fear. My husband was already up and out of bed. She cowered behind him, still screaming.

“No!” I shouted, “It’s me!” I realized that I, too, was cowering in the exact same way before him. 

Turns out, he trusted Her more. In a flash, he tackled me to the ground and restrained me. I begged him to stop, repeating over and over that She was the fake. The whole time, She wouldn’t stop screaming. 

I knew he’d hurt me if I stayed pinned down much longer. I used my good leg to land a single well-placed kick and fight my way free. At a loss for what to do, I scrambled on all fours out of the room and grabbed my crutches before fleeing the house. 

I was as slow as an injured animal; they could have easily caught up to me if they’d wanted. My husband was probably too stunned to follow. 

I shuffled down my empty block, then another and another.

Five blocks from my house, I passed the spot where the accident happened. It was like being punched in the gut. Or rather, flung into a tree all over again. I paused, then sobbed. It was all too much.

I couldn’t go back home without being attacked. I couldn’t go to the police - the accident was just two weeks behind me and they wouldn’t be happy to see me again. I had no friends, no family I could turn to.

I turned to the woods. I had no other choice, nowhere to go.  The adrenaline rush was wearing off, and though I wasn’t happy about it, the crash was coming. I fell asleep, hoping the next morning I’d wake up in my bed with only the memory of a bad dream.

Instead, I awoke on a bed of sticks and dried brush. My crutches made a *clack, shhh, clack, shh* dragging through the dirt.

Still with nowhere to go, I returned to my house through the backwoods. I was terrified at what I’d find. 

At the breakfast table near the window facing the backyard, they had coffee. The way I did, every morning, until the accident. She said something to make him chuckle. He got up, presumably to grab the coffee pot, the way he used to. She must have convinced him it was all a bad dream.

I was at the treeline and She saw me. She stood up and faced me directly. She wasn’t even using crutches anymore. I raised an arm, almost waving. So did She. I saw movement behind her, my husband returning to the table.

I don’t know what compelled me, but I dodged behind a tree as quickly as I could. Again, trembling. 

What scared me the most was how quick he was to accept this other Me, the one without crutches. I guess I don’t blame him for liking Her more. She looked happier, unscarred by the events of two weeks prior. After all, She wasn’t responsible for the running accident, which took my track star son’s life and left me with just a broken leg and a totaled car.
