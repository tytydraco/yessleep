Reina Annmarie Quinn left Kentucky when she was seventeen; one year and four months after the death of her best friend. She was born and raised in Cumberland, a little town right at the base of Black Mountain.



When she was nine years old a family moved into her neighborhood, four houses down from her own, and on the opposite side of the street. It was a small town, so a new family moving in was a big deal. Her parents took her to meet the new family, and that’s how she met her best friend: Sara. 



Sara was also nine years old, and my mom (Reina in case you’re not tracking), was her life line. I don’t know why Sara’s family moved to Cumberland, because Reina never knew. I’m guessing Sara didn’t know, or didn’t fully understand, I mean they were nine. They probably weren’t being included in the family discussions at that point.



Sara was an only child, all the more tragic for her parents when she died, but my mom was a part of a massive family. She was the youngest of all her siblings, with her oldest sister being ten years older than her, and the brother closest in age to her was four years older. By the time my mom was fourteen she was the only one of her siblings still living at home. I think a lot of times she felt like an only child, so Sara made her feel understood. Less alone.



For Sara’s part she was a lonely kid, an only child, both her parents worked, and moving to a new town meant she didn’t have any friends until my mom came along. Sara was shy, Reina was not, and it was a perfect match in every way. Sara gave my mom the close, sisterly friendship she had always wanted from her own sisters, and my mom stood up for Sara and gave her the confidence to try new things.



They started out with a normal nine-year-old-girl friendship. They would knock on each other's front doors, ask to play, and spend an afternoon playing with dolls, dressing up in one of their mom’s clothes, or drawing pictures. After about a year of this they got bored, and started playing outside more. First just playing in the backyard, or walking through the neighborhood together, but before long they were full-on wilderness explorers.



It was at this point in the story that my mom stopped and said, “Listen Sammy, I need you to suspend your disbelief for a few minutes. Do you know what I’m saying?”



I did. Not only do I understand what that means, but I understood exactly what she was asking me for. She was asking that I not try to rationalize my own experiences to the point of no longer being able to believe hers. I took a deep breath, accepted that what I had experienced was real (as much as I could anyway), and closed my eyes for a moment.



Finally I replied, “Yes I do, I promise I’ll listen.”



She didn’t acknowledge that, but she did keep talking.



She and Sara started hiking together, and they both got really into it. They would empty out their school backpacks, fill them with supplies, and spend a whole Saturday or Sunday out in the woods with no adult supervision. I thought things were lax when I was a kid, but man growing up in Kentucky in the sixties, she was basically raising herself half the time. She said her parents often didn’t realize she had been gone, until she got home, even for days at a time.



When she and Sara were thirteen they found an ancient graveyard tucked away in the hills behind Cumberland. She couldn’t pinpoint where it was now, but she and Sara would walk through the woods alone to meet at the graveyard nearly every day, sometimes only making it back home way after dark.



You have to understand as I recap this part of the story, none of what they were doing seemed weird to them. It was the sixties, a backwoods town in nowhere Kentucky, there wasn’t a lot to do. So finding a cool graveyard that no one else knew about, with a beautiful stone structure in the center of it, they didn’t consider the idea of sacred ground or anything like that. All they knew was that they had found a gorgeous white stone structure that looked a little like a cross between a gazebo, and a very small house.



She gave me an embarrassed chuckle, “Now of course I understand that was a mausoleum of some kind, but for two thirteen year old girls it just seemed like a clubhouse. I know now how foolish we were but…”



She trailed off and I offered, “I don’t think it was foolish, I think you were kids. Kids can’t be expected to know about stuff like that.”



She went on. They found this mausoleum, and they made it into a clubhouse. They took decorations and toys, stashed snacks and water there, and it was where they went any time they didn’t want to be at home, pretty much for their entire childhood. As usual, my mom painted an incredible word picture for me: two little girls surrounded by bones and coffins, as well as all the paper butterfly chains they had made and decorated the place with. Their clubhouse was perfect, fully decked out for two little girls in the sixties.



They spent their free time out there playing games they’d created, making crafts, or making rubbings of some of the gravestones and making up stories for the people buried there. They made little gifts and left them on the gravestones, or in the mouth of the mausoleum. She said that the gifts were always gone when they came back, and they made up stories about that too. Sometimes they told each other it was fairies, sometimes ghosts, sometimes it was a mystery mountain man (or woman) collecting their crafts because he or she was lonely. 



Looking back, my mom said, she thinks they were leaving offerings for whatever was living in that graveyard, without knowing it.



Anyway mom and Sara spent most of their free time in the graveyard, but they made up a set of rules. Or at least, she thinks they made them up.



When she said that I asked, “What do you mean? You aren’t sure which one of you made them?”



There was an unusual hesitation in her voice, “No I mean, I don’t remember us making the rules at all. I just remember that at some point we had a written list of rules in the mausoleum.”



I suddenly felt like I was an interviewer on a podcast, trying to get to the bottom of a mystery, “And you followed the rules?”



I could hear the child she used to be in her reply, “Of course we did. We… Sara and I both thought the other person had made the rules for weeks. It may have been even longer before we figured it out, but I think… I think we just knew we needed to follow the rules. It didn’t matter which of us wrote them or… or if neither of us wrote them at all.”



The phone line was quiet until I asked, “What were the rules? Do you remember?”



She said, “Of course I do. Rule one: No whistling. Rule two: Get home before dark. Rule 3: Always stay together.”



I laughed, “Okay I see what you mean, I would have thought my friend wrote that too. Were those the only rules?”



She confirmed yes and I asked where the rules were written. She said, “On the wall, inside the mausoleum. Written with chalk, or maybe charcoal.”



I shivered, “Nothing about that creeped you out?”



She sighed tiredly, “Sammy, I don’t know what to say to that sweetie.”



I winced, “I’m sorry, that was unnecessary. Please keep going.”



After the rules appeared mom and Sara became more careful about walking around after dark, but I think that was the only rule they took seriously. This was the point in the story where I could tell my mom didn’t want to be having the conversation anymore, her voice grew tired and heavy. I considered telling her to go to bed, we could talk about it more after work, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t wait that long, sitting in my dark house feeling terrified of everything past my front door. As selfish as it was, I needed her to stay on the phone with me as badly as I needed to know what happened to Sara.



She said, “We kept going to our clubhouse, even after we realized it was a part of the graveyard. But as we got older we stopped leaving our offerings. We were teenagers by that point, and we didn’t really make crafts or make up stories about faeries anymore. We had no idea that we had been right all along, the little things we were making and leaving on the gravestones were protecting us. After we stopped leaving them things got weird.”



She went on to say that as the offerings trickled to a stop, the graveyard began to feel less friendly. They had never seen signs of anyone else spending time there, no litter or foot prints, no graffiti, nothing to indicate other people knew it existed. That had felt magical at one point, and then it became a warning. My dad always told me that I should avoid human made structures, if everyone else was avoiding it too. I thought that was weird advice for a long time. Now I get it.



They started finding some off things around their mausoleum.  First their snacks started going missing. Right when they had decided to stop bringing snacks at all (saying the wild animals must be getting them) they went in to find that their latest stash of snacks had been flung all over the small marble structure. All the packages had been torn open, but not a single bite had been eaten, even by animals.



My mom paused there and said, “I don’t know if Sara also came to this realization or not, but seeing all that food and no sign of animals… Well, Samira, you know how birds get really loud, then go totally silent right before a storm?”



I nodded, “Of course. ‘The calm before the storm’ as people always say.”



She hates that saying, (also a story for another time), and she sighed heavily before replying, “Right. Well animals are smart. They can sense a lot of dangers long before humans can. When I realized even the animals stayed away from the mausoleum, I realized how much danger we had been in. If the animals don’t want to go somewhere, you shouldn’t either.”



“Is that what dad always meant when he said I should avoid structures that everyone else is avoiding?”



My mom cleared her throat, “I guess he and I are both getting at the same idea from different perspectives, but yes. If you ever find  a place that people and animals both avoid, run. Get away from that place.”



I swallowed hard, wishing more than anything that I was at home in my bed in Alaska sleeping. “Okay, so you realized animals wouldn’t even go in there to eat your snacks. Then what?”



Reina and Sara cleaned it, and even though Reina was done with the mausoleum by that point, Sara didn’t want to give up on it just yet.  They kept going back and for a few days things seemed fine. Then they started finding footprints. First all around the outside, and through the graveyard. Then, on the fourth day, the footprints went inside.



The footprints looked like someone had tracked mud into the mausoleum, but there was one unusual thing they couldn’t quite figure out. Next to the footprints were a bunch of mud dots.



She said, “Roughly every two paces there was a dot. Footprint, footprint, dot, footprint, footprint, dot. All over the room, like someone was pacing.”



I was puzzled, “What were the dots?”



“A cane. I figured it out later, when my grandpappy had to start using a cane.”



I rubbed the back of my neck as I glanced at the window to make sure the curtains were still closed, “How did someone with a cane make it all the way out there? You said it was a rough hike for two kids, it would have been impossible for an adult with a limp.”



I could practically see her sad, faraway smile when she said, “Impossible yes. Unless they were already there.”



Outside, somewhere, a dog howled and I had to clamp my mouth shut to keep from screaming.



I said, “Well that’s creepy as shit mom.”



She chuckled, “Yes. But we were young and foolish and didn’t think about it hard enough. Then the bones started appearing.”



I swallowed a terrified whimper and said, “As much as I would normally love the ghost story vibes, I’ve had kind of a rough weekend. Can I ask you to skip to what happened to Sara?”



She was quiet for a moment, and then she said, “Normally I would Sammy, but I think you need to hear all of it. Because the point at the end of my story is that Appalachia is full of dangerous things, not just snakes and wasps but *creatures*. And not just creatures but… phenomena. Things I still don’t even have a word for.”



I was quiet for a long time. Finally I said, “You’re right. Keep going.”



The mausoleum kept getting creepier and weirder, basically whatever seemed to own the mausoleum was telling them to leave and never come back. First it was their snacks being scattered all over the room, then whatever it was started scattering what looked like chicken bones. Each day they went back the bones got larger, although they still appeared to be animal bones. Then the bones seemed less animal, more human. That’s when they left, and never went back. 



She chuckled a little, “Sammy, we thought we were so tough and smart. The day we decided not to go back Sara and I went to the mausoleum and cleaned everything up. We made it look nice, I left a little gift, just a craft I’d made, and Sara and I promised not to return. It felt very lovely, I think we both felt like we had done the right thing. But then we had a problem, where would we spend our time? I was content to stay in town, go back to meeting up at one of our houses or join the other four teenagers in town at the soda shop. I had enjoyed our hikes and adventures, but I also liked the idea of spending more time with other kids our age. But Sara felt so much like a fish out of water around other people, she needed somewhere that was just ours. So we continued looking, together. But I didn’t realize Sara was also going out on her own, trying to find another place as magical as our graveyard had felt. I think if I had known that, if I had known how badly she needed a space like that, I would have behaved really differently.”



I shivered, a graveyard would not feel magical to me. But I could understand what she meant.



Sara was going out by herself, into the woods, into the mountains, in search of another place they could call their own. And she found it. About six miles from the graveyard in the opposite direction, she found a fairy circle with an old set of stairs that went to nowhere.



The glade was like something out of a fairy tale picture book, and when they first discovered the stairs it seemed like their hopes had been answered. A bed of green clover, a perfect circle made by a ring of flowers of various colors, and underneath almost every flower a little ring of mushrooms grew. It was beautiful and perfect, and just for the two of them. It was less creepy than being in the graveyard, and felt a little more private and a lot more magical.



At the perfect center of the ring sat a staircase, made of stone and covered in moss and ivy. Only the stairs themselves remained clear, as if they were being stepped on enough to keep anything from growing there. She said they looked old and weather worn, and she and Sara would often sit on the base of them and talk. In some ways it was an upgrade from the graveyard, even if there was no storage space. 



And then one day she and Sara got in a fight.



“We were walking towards the glade one day and got into an argument over something stupid. I was mad at her because we had agreed to go to a school dance together, and she had gotten nervous and decided not to. I was hurt, she was my closest friend and I was starting to feel like her being so shy was holding me back. We were still walking, but I was refusing to talk. She kept trying to apologize and get me to talk to her but I was being stubborn. When she got to the glade she said she would walk all the way up the stairs and jump off if I didn’t say anything, but I stayed silent. We had agreed to never walk to the top of the stairs, I think we just knew instinctively… I didn’t expect her to. I thought she was calling my bluff, but she wasn’t. She walked to the top of the stairs, all the way up there were 12 steps. And then she was gone.”



I felt my eyes narrowing, my brow furrowing, “Gone?”



“Vanished.”



“Vanished.”



Mom sighed, “Stop repeating me please, yes gone. Vanished. It was like I blinked and the top picture got pulled off the stack and thrown away. One minute Sara is standing there on the stairs saying ‘Reina come on, I’m gonna jump if you don’t forgive me’. And the next minute, she’s just… gone.”



I let out a puff of air, “What did you say to her parents?”



She let out a little sob and I wished I was there to hold her, “I told them the truth! Everything, the whole story. They didn’t believe me. I took them out there and showed them the stairs. I took them to the mausoleum. At first they accused me of doing something to her and making up lies to cover it, but as time passed and she still didn’t show up they seemed to think I had gone crazy. Then they decided she had died by accident, and I had seen it happen, and my mind had just snapped from the stress of it all. They went from treating me like a pariah to treating me like a crazy person. I stopped going to school, the other kids hated me, they thought I killed my best friend. And in a sense Samira, I always felt like I did. If I hadn’t been so stubborn, Sara would still be alive.”



I took several deep breaths, “Mom. I’m so sorry.”



She sniffled, “The only other person who knows about it is your dad. I spent the next year searching for her everywhere. I took to going for walks by myself at night, and nearly all of those nights are stories for some other time. But finally my night time wandering took me back to the fairy glade. I have no idea why it took me so long, I was probably scared.” She let out a sob that cut right through my spirit. “And there she was! Walking up the stairs, turning around to say something to me, and then vanishing. Over and over and over again. I watched her for what felt like hours. Finally I called her name, and she looked at me, Sammy. She looked right at me and cried out for help and I… I ran. I ran and I never went back. I ran all the way home, grabbed my wallet and a change of clothes and I took off. I left Kentucky in the middle of the night. I never went back, and my family never tried to find me.”



I gulped down my tears, feeling heartbroken for her. “That’s when you met dad.”



She sighs again, “That’s when I met your dad. I wanted, no, I needed to get as far away as possible.”



“Alaska.”



“Yes.”



We sat in silence for a long time. Finally I choked out, “Mom, what do I do?”



She responded with a watery laugh, “Honey you may not want my advice.”



I sniffled, “Go ahead.”



Her voice was pleading, “Come home. Come back to Alaska. Honey, I‘ve seen things you could never even dream up, I had to leave Kentucky, it was my only chance. It wasn’t just about Sara, it was about all the things I saw, everything that nearly got me. I wasn’t just scared of being treated like a pariah or a crazy person, I realized that place is full of things that are so much older than any of us. And none of the things I encountered followed me here. You’ll be safe if you come back, I‘m sure of it.”



It was an extremely tempting offer, but I couldn’t take it. “I love my job. And I need to explain to Nora what happened. And… if I run it’ll make me look suspicious. Like I did something to them. And I think people will come after me if I do that. I need to stay, at least for now.”



My mom let out a heartbroken sigh and said, “Of course sweetie. If you ever change your mind I’ll be here waiting. Other than that, I think the only thing you can do is keep following the rules. Always get home before dark, and be careful. Your home should be safe, and you can find some other things to protect yourself.”



My mom and I stayed up until early morning talking. She told me a few stories from the time when she was looking for Sara, and then a few more light hearted stories about her and Sara.

If you're interesting in  hearing more of my mom's stories let me know in the comments, and I'll see if I can post a few of them.
