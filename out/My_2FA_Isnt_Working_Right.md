You know what? These days, I think I'd much rather take the risk of a cybersecurity breach over the inconvenience of 2-factor authentication, changing my passwords every 30 days, not reusing a single password, not enabling auto-login, blah blah blah.

It's just not worth the headache! What are they even going to find if they break in? My boring conversations with my friends about their trips, work, families? My credit card information for a card I can just cancel and dispute the charges on? My address, for an apartment that I won't renew the lease on in six months? I say let 'em have it. The account recovery nonsense when I've logged myself out is not worth the trouble. Quantum computing will enable rapid-fire account cracking soon enough, no matter how strong my password is.

I've been in an online waiting room to chat with an agent from Luun, the social media site specifically built for night owls and insomniacs, for over an hour now. If I minimize the chat, press the back button, or even refresh the page, I get sent straight to the end-of-the-line purgatory. So here I sit, watching the page with the delicacy and bated breath normally reserved for Wimbledon matches or sleeping firstborns. Based on the lengthy wait time, I guess there's some sort of system-wide issue impacting a large number of users. I look at my place in line: 164/442.

*Sigh.*

I make my way to the kitchen. Surely I wouldn't progress to the front of the line before I had time to make myself a midnight snack. I leave my laptop behind; the waiting room UI was already burned into my retinas and I needed to look at literally anything else. I grab my phone and walk into the kitchen, waking my one-year-old Samoyed, Goob. He hopped off the bed and followed me. Only one of his ears had popped up so far, giving me a constant reminder of his baby status and letting him get away with daylight (or, in this case, nightlight) robbery of my time, food, and comfort with no complaint.

Before we made it to the kitchen, we passed by the front door and Goob ran to it expectantly. He grabbed his leash and wagged his tail, doing the impatient little stomp dogs do when they are excited about things.

"Oh, good boy, Goob! Let's get some fresh air. You're right. Maybe we can even walk to the In N Out and get a late-night snackie! Yeah?"

Goob "awoo-d" in response. I threw on my shoes and followed him out the front door, taking in a deep breath of fresh, summer night air. The voices of people milling around the neighborhood, kids in truck beds drinking or people walking home in pairs from bars, made me miss the quiet New England nights. There was a sort of privacy and reverence for the dark there that simply didn’t exist on the West Coast. Nighttime meant less light pollution, the humming of nature’s war machines (I really don’t like insects), and a sort of deep-rooted institutional memory of the area’s darker histories. Pilgrims starved to death here before they were rescued by native populations, and then still chose to bite off the hands that fed them. We are lucky to have so much peace and abundance today without having to participate in that kind of inhumanity. The wind that touches us today might well be the same one that caressed a starving ancestor’s gaunt cheek. The veil is thin, and New Englanders know that.

Californians just don’t get the significance of the night. They chase away the acknowledgment of our darker tendencies with fluorescence and loud music, and undergo any number of plastic surgeries to wipe away the signs of life’s struggles. God forbid a shield show the signs of having protected anything at all, right?

Goob didn’t seem to care. He had never lost his Samoyed smile no matter which coast he’d lived on. I should try to be more like him, more Californian, I suppose. In pursuit of this Sisyphean goal I decided to call a friend back in Salem (Massachusetts, not Oregon) to cheer me up. I pulled my phone out of my pocket only to realize it was already unlocked and had been on full brightness in my pocket this entire time.

*Ugh.*

The battery was down to 8%. I decided to take a tech-free walk and make good on my promise to take Goob to In N Out. We grabbed a plain beef patty burger for him and a Double Double for me and made our way back home, the violent sound bath of frat boys and sports fans surrounding us most of the way there.

I slammed the door shut and plugged in my phone, returning to my laptop. 35/442 in line. Great progress!

Goob settled in next to me and I cuddled him. I was thankful it was the weekend, because being locked out of my account was taking up most of my night and I’d definitely need to sleep in tomorrow. I reached for my phone to set a 10 AM alarm and found it unlocked…again.

*What the fuck?*

How many cybersecurity issues was I going to have in one night?

“Have we pissed off the Russians, Goob?” I asked as I pressed the side button to lock my phone. This time, it actually stayed locked and in sleep mode. “Okay. Spoke too soon, I think we’re —”

*What. The. Fuck.*

My phone, which was face-up on the bed facing the ceiling, had just been unlocked with Face ID. I’ve never set up my phone to be unlocked with anyone else’s face.

This was no account compromise. Even if I used the same password for everything, this was Face ID. A biometric scan. Infrared, 3D detection of a face, not an alphanumeric string to be predicted. I began to panic. Goob sensed my alarm and ended up popping up his second ear as he stood up on high alert. I ran to the light switch and flicked it on. There was no one else in the room, but Goob had begun to growl. I didn’t even know he could - he was literally the sweetest dog anyone had ever known. That’s when the dread started sinking in. My knees buckled and I started hyperventilating. All that respect I had for the gods of the night, and never once did I ask myself what I would do if I ever got on their bad side.

*DING!*

I’d somehow made it to the front of the waiting line for Luun. What *terrible* timing. I was now too scared to cross the room and grab my laptop to talk to the customer service agent.

*DING!*

“Crap! Okay uh….Goob? Fetch! Fetch my computer!”

Goob was still growling, but he broke out of his reverie to throw me a confused look. He jumped off the bed and ran towards me, the divot he made in the bed causing my laptop to tumble onto the floor and slide a bit towards me.

“Good boy, Goob!” I cheered, using an umbrella by my door to scoot my laptop the rest of the way towards me and hurrying the two of us out of my room. Whatever supernatural shit was going down in my room, it would have to wait, just like I did for 4 hours online.

“I’m here, I’m here, I’m here!” I shouted when I entered the chat.

“How can I help you?” asked the friendly voice on the other side.

“I’ve been locked out of my account. I have a million passwords and I memorize them all so I don’t have a password manager breach, and I swear I knew my password for Luun but it’s just not working this week.”

“Oh, no worries! That’s because we’ve upgraded all users to 2-factor authentication this week using the phone number they have on file with their account. If you can grab your phone for me I’ll send you a QR code right now that you can scan with it and you should be able to access your account right away!”

“Um….No, I’m sorry, but I don’t have access to my phone right now.”

“Are you sure you’re the account owner? Can I ask you some identifying questions?”

“Yes! Please.” I realized how suspiciously eager I sounded to get into this account. The service rep grilled me accordingly with a series of identifying security questions.

A brief pause, then a heavy sigh. “Ma’am, I’m afraid we can’t let you in without sending a text to your phone or having you scan a QR code with it. You don’t have an email address on file and even though you’ve passed the identity check, the system isn’t letting me reset your password from my end. Your only option is to reset it yourself.”

*FUCK.*

“Can’t I just give you an email address now?”

“I’m sorry, but no. Protocol says I can’t add new information at this stage; otherwise, any random person could answer a few security questions and mess up your info.”

“Okay…can you stay on the line with me for a second? I’ll see if I can get my phone working again.”

“Sure thing.”

I gave Goob an anxious look, and he dutifully followed me to my room. I turned the knob. I heard a quiet sigh and nearly jumped out of my skin before realizing it came from the impatient customer service rep still on the other side of the chat on my laptop. I used the wave of relief from this realization to gather the courage to finally shoulder the door open.

Except I couldn’t. It was stuck. I leaned all my weight into it, and it didn’t budge.

“Oh, come on!” I yelled.

“I’m waiting for *you*, Ms. Henderson,” replied the customer service agent coldly. “We still have 313 more customers tonight. In fact, I think the best course of action would be for me to send you a QR code with a permalink to reset your password at your leisure. You’ll find it in your text messages when you regain access to your phone. Have a great night!”

“WAIT!” I pleaded, but she’d already ended the chat. Goob and I were now truly alone, with no way to call for help.

Well, I suppose I could finally find a use for the Californian friendliness and ask a neighbor for help. I turned to grab Goob’s leash and take him outside with me when I saw movement out of the corner of my eye. I didn’t want to face this alone, but I had no choice. I slowly rotated back towards my bedroom door, expecting some horror movie trope to await me. A claw under the door, a skittering creature crawling down from the ceiling like a roach. Instead, I found my bedroom door wide open. Lights on and everything, phone unmoved, just as I’d left it.

All right, time to enter the lair of the dragon, I suppose. I stepped in. Goob growled. I stepped further in. Goob started barking.

“I know, I know, I’m sorry! I’m being so stupid! But how else are we going to call 911?” I apologized to my dog as I sprinted the remaining distance to my phone. I snatched it off the charger, ran out of the room, and slammed the door behind me.

The ridiculousness of what I’d said sank in. How were we going to call 911? That was way less important than *why* we were going to call 911. What was I supposed to say, my phone is glitching?

The dread hadn’t left me, but empathy for the police officer listening to my story was overpowering it. Goob was in Velcro mode now, keeping watch over the rest of the house from his vantage point on my lap. I turned my phone over in my palms JUST as all the lights in the house went out.

I had no fight or flight left in me, just freeze. I didn’t know what to do. The darkness wasn’t normal - even my dark-activated nightlights weren’t on, and the world outside the windows was opaquely inky. My phone, predictably, unlocked itself unprompted as I stared at it. Goob was nowhere to be seen, or felt.

*Okay. Just me and the night. Here we go.*
