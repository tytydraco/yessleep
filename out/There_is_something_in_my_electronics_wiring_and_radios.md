Last night I was taking a shower. The water was refreshing for I had been walking for the entire day in the hot southern sun. after I finished cleaning myself I went to go turn off the water so, when I turned I naturally bended over to reach the nob that turns it on and off. It was right above the drain. I saw something in the drain it looked like hair, but I didn’t think anything about it until when I was sitting in bed I realized it wasn’t anyone in my houses hair. It was blonde. My family and I have brown and black hair.          

Today I was creeping down stairs early in the morning because my parents were taking us to breakfast. My dog was looking at me when I was going down stairs but, when I got down he was still staring. I heard a creek. My stairs were built so they turn at the wall and you couldn’t see up the second part after making the turn. I climbed back up the stairs. Nothing absolutely nothing was there. I did notice something with the lights they were slowly brightening. “Most likely a problem with the electrical circuits or whatever I thought.” After waiting for what felt like hours my father came out of his room looking at me weirdly. “Hey what are you looking at”? The light was now off. I looked at my dad from the side of the stair wall. He looked upset that I woke up an hour before we left to go eat. I told him that I thought we were going to leave sooner. 

I bit my thumb and started upstairs. On the car ride to the diner I was looking at my phone when I saw a blonde lady around the age of 25ish on TikTok. She didn’t move she just stared into the screen. I was transfixed it was weirdly serene. Her face made my worries about the hair in the shower and the light fade away into the gratifying release of peace. After about 20 seconds I scrolled down it was HER again! This time she was smiling. A wonderful feminine smile that made my happiness stronger. Although it was odd that I saw her again even after scrolling 3 more times. I decided to turn my phone off. Either way we were only about 15 minutes away from the diner I didn’t need it. When we got to the diner we saw a utility pole had fallen over blocking the entrance to the diner. We then drove home as my father didn’t want to wait for it to be picked up and fixed. We ate breakfast at the house. It was nothing special but it was still pretty good. As the day went on the light on the stairs stopped turning on. I thought it was broken but when I left the stairs my father told me the light would turn on for him. I was upstairs texting my girlfriend in my room. I had an old radio that my grandfather gave me. The radio suddenly turned on. I don’t know how or why bit it did. A faint flutter could be heard. Now there was a strange sound almost like blinking. Flaps of cloth folding on each other. I ran out the room dashing across the hallway and to the stairs…a translucent object was attached to the light. It looked like a toaster. I stopped in my tracts gazing at it.
