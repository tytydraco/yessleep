I know people are going to say that this is fake but I’d still like to put this out there. I M 16 went to a friends (F 17) Halloween party yesterday. I showed up late with two other friends (M 17 and F2 17) we were late because we were doing our makeup for our costumes that took longer than expected. We arrived and placed our snacks down and sat around the kitchen bench talking about what movie we were gonna watch next. There were 8 of us all together and we decided to watch the conjuring because half of us hadn’t seen it. I have watched it multiple times before so I was excited to share this new horror experience with them. I love horror and can never get enough of it, I’m at the point of loving horror so much nothing really scares me anymore. I also believe strongly of the paranormal. I would constantly tell my friends of ally past ghost experiences and we’d go walk through the cemetery at night so we were pretty used to paranormal activity. 

Before we put the movie on one of the people who were already there left because the conjuring has references to the devil. I laughed at that and said it was just a movie. But with him gone we still watched it. In the movie they play a game called hide and clap where one person is blind folded and they have to find the others. It looked pretty fun and I suggested we play it and everyone was on board so we did. There were 7 of us but we played 5 rounds with swapping who was it. Then we wanted to do a ouija board my friend printed one and we used it. I always said I’d never mess around with a ouija board but I convinced myself it would be fine and did it anyways since we printed it out. We cleansed the area and ourselves and we (4 of us) each put two fingers on the piece to interact with it. We moved it around the board and we all said we call out to any spirits that wanted to contact us. It didn’t work after roughly a dozen times so we gave up and my friend (F 17) light the paper ouija board on fire. 

After that we played one last game of hide and clap. She was in and I was last to be found. After that there were on five of us. Someone went home. Us 5 decided to light a candle and put it in the floor and we all sat around it holding hands. We called out to any spirits that wanted to make contact. We asked them to make a noise or a creak or move something. We also asked them to make a loud noise. But nothing happened apart from my friend ( F2 17). She was able to see ghosts sometimes and see auras of spirits. She kept looking into the dark room behind me and I looked but saw nothing. Nothing happened with the candle so we blew it out and said goodbye. Everyone went their separate ways through the house and I went with F2 17. She then told me she saw something behind me and told me not to tell the others because they would freak out. 

After a bit of time it was just 4 of us. Me M 16, F1 17, F2 17 and M 17. We were getting tired and it was around 2am so we watched a movie for a bit and they all fell asleep on the lounge. Apart from me I wasn’t that tired but still tried to sleep after turning off the movie. when everyone was basically asleep i heard my friend say something I said what and she didn’t answer. I heard her voice but I wasn’t sure if it was coming from her direction. I think I heard her say either “yew” or “you” but I brushed it off and tried to sleep.I was laying there on the lounge and I could see the room my friend saw something in. It was pitch black so I put a blanket over my head and turned away from it.

 I was feeling pretty sleepy and I heard a chip packet crinkle followed by a footstep. I was on high alert but brushed it off as nothing but I heard it again but in a different part of the kitchen a part where there wasn’t any chip packets. That freaked my out a bit but I hurried my head into my pillow and tried to ignore it. It was not even 10 mins later and I heard it. Two perfect echoey claps coming from the room my friend saw something in. I was freaked out of my mind. I instantly started pushing myself away from the area and woke up my friends. I was shaking and crying. It was the scariest thing I’ve ever experienced. After they cleared the room I heard it from they claimed me down a bit and we all went to sleep in her bedroom. We packed in tight but we all fit. I couldn’t sleep we got into bed at 3am and I was wide awake until 5am. It’s now the next day and I’m home alone and I fear if I’ll hear it again tonight. 

It may not seem that scary but I was freaked and I don’t know why I’m posting this but it feels good to share and warn people to not play this game. Thank you.
