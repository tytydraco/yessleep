Welcome to [REDACTED], one of the most esteemed call centers in your local area. This cassette tape and player are company property and as long as they remain with you, you will be held responsible for any damages incurred to them. If you have received them, you must be a new employee to our [REDACTED] branch. 

Please use this opportunity to listen and rewind the tape as often you like to keep the rules of our branch by-heart. It is especially important that you keep the rules in mind given the specific situation that you are in.

The [REDACTED] branch is infamous for having a highly fluid workforce with most people unable to hold a position for more than 2 months. This is thanks in no small part to the large reports of supernatural occurrences filed by our current and previous employees.

Taking into account these reports and previous incidents, we have provided this tape as an add-on to the rulebook you have already been given. it contains a few rules and precautions that you must take while clocked in for your shift.

Rule #1- As soon as you clock in, make your way to the desk in the cubicle to the right of yours and wait exactly 3 mins before moving to your desk. 

Any more or any less will result in your desktop acting oddly throughout your shift and a subsequent reduction in number in calls. This will have the added effect of impacting your statistics and thus reduce your chance of a bonus at the end of your contract.

Rule #2- As a part of your duties, you will receive calls from various customers in regards to their devices and the related issues. These calls will be normal and registered in our database. However, you will receive calls once or twice a week from an individual who will identify himself as John A. Smith. (If it helps, previous employees have described his voice as chilly and cold even through the headset) 

Unlike our registered customers, he will not be on our database and his number will indicate as such. To this caller, you are to repeat the words:

"Im sorry sir, there is nothing we can do to help you." 

Employees who have failed to do so have been found unresponsive at their desks and have subsequently dies from unidentifiable causes. 

Rule #3- Every night, at 11:03 pm, your floor will lose power and the lights will switch off as a result. When this happens, immediately use the flashlight we have provided to intermittently illuminate the ceiling for 2 minutes at a pace of 1 click every 2 seconds. 120 seconds, 60 clicks.

If you have performed this correctly, the lights will come back on when the clock reads 11:05 pm. You will not see the beams of your coworker's flashlights, but do not fail to use your own. If you do not perform it correctly, the lights will not turn back on and the rest of the night will be spent in darkness. 

Any subsequent attempts to use the flashlight will result in the same conditions as described in Rule #2.

Rule #4- There is a small room on your floor labelled B-59 with a singular tubelight illuminating it. While it appears to be a storage closet, the use of B-59 (along with the use of any and all items within B-59) is prohibited.

Anything that goes into the room will cause the tubelight to flicker intensely and cause the object within it to disappear once the tubelight resumes function normally. This includes humans and other living beings.

All attempts to seal off the room have been unsuccessful. We advise to steer clear of the hallway that B-59 is located in.

Rule #5- Do not fall asleep in the office during working hours. There have been many instances of employees taking a nap around the middle of their shift and not waking up again until months have passed.

Nicknamed the "Sleeping Beauty Curse" or SBC for short, the sleeping sickness manifests as an unending sleep with the sleeper experiencing intermittently full body twitches, tremors, and even seizures. 

Attempts to wake up SBC victims have resulted in them turning unnaturally violent (in most cases resulting in collateral damage of property and life) and having to be handled accordingly by our internal security forces.
