It started out as a usual evening, a few of us guys out, playing ball at the park. On the road beside the park, there was an abattoir, not a big one, just a small farm slaughterhouse.  It was part of an old rundown farm on the edge of town.  It was a dank building made of concrete bricks and having grass that grows a little bit too high around it.   Attached to it were two studio apartments for the hired help.   It seemed like nobody was living there.  One of us decided to throw a few pebbles at the window of the butcher's apartment.  

Nothing returned back the ping and It seemed darker and more dilapidated then ever. Feeling a little bit adventuresome, we decided it was a fun idea to explore the apartment.  Who would live in such place?  Maybe they had left knives behind.  Why not I said.

 “There are alot of cobwebs!”, I said with excitement, hanging half out the window.  "Which means it's waiting for us!”.  

They all followed me in, our flashlights rapidly scaling the room like a light show.  Once inside we realized we weren't sure where the front door even was and as we searched we turned a corner and realize there was a hidden stairs that lead to the slaughterhouse.  As we creaked up the stairs, a very small light flicked on in the butcher house, but enough we could see it.

All the others with me, they took off, backed out the window and left.   I alone stayed. When I got to top of the small stairs, I finally had a full view of the warehouse.

There was a very round man sleeping by the front door of the slaughterhouse.  The man jumped up, staring at me. My flashlight shone on his face, which was red and sweating profusely. The man then started coming towards me.

"What are you doing here?”  He held his head to the side, sweat pouring that way with his mouth drooping as he waited on an answer.  "I know it was you who just broke in here and I know I can clearly describe you to the police, so you might as well admit what you came here for."   

He placed his hand on the small of my back, and whispered “I've got something for you, boy ”. He smelled of cigarettes, piss and dirty corners.  He unzipped his pants.

"See this boy, this  here is your gatekeeper," he said swinging it in windmills. "Kiss it,boy." 

I closed my eyes but heard his belt clang to the floor  “We can't do this here”, he whispered to me, his breath husky with arousal and derelict wine.  He turned me to look across the room at the butcher blocks.  "We need to go there," he slobbered.  

I flashed my light right in is eyes to stun him, but he instantly snatched the light from my hand and threw it across the room.  But the light shone right on his feet and I realized with his pants and underwear ringed around his ankles that he was disabled.   I ran as fast as I could to the apartment and out slipped out the window.

I never found out the name of that man or what his exact sex offenses are, but I was able to grab his wallet from the ground as I ran out and even though it was empty, it had what I needed in it.  Tucked into a worn out leather corner was his sister's number all tattered. She said his name was Johannes and that he'd been doing these things all his life because nobody helps him..  She wanted me to forget it, saying he'd been bothered by their mother and her boyfriend till child services came for him and he'd fallen onto the streets and had alot of bad luck after that.  Begging me to just leave him be and dont inflict more trauma on him.
