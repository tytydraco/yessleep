Read this quickly—I don’t have much time. They’re probably tracking me already. My name is Dr. Allan Brock, and I’ve uncovered proof that our reality is just one thread in a vast, tangled multiverse. But knowing this might cost me everything.

Ten years ago, I was appointed head of Project Portland, a deep-space satellite tasked with detecting cosmic anomalies heading toward Earth. For most of its operational life, it found nothing unusual—just the occasional meteor cluster or radiation spike.

That changed two months ago.

One evening, as I was reviewing routine data feeds in my office, the satellite registered an object—a massive one—heading straight for Earth at an impossible speed. At first, my team and I dismissed it as a meteor cluster, but the heat signatures were off the charts. And there was something else: a pulsing energy reading, unlike anything we’d ever seen.

We estimated the object would reach Earth’s atmosphere in eighteen hours. Immediately, I contacted NASA and the Department of Defense, initiating E-COM—our classified protocol for potential first contact with extraterrestrial life. They ordered silence. No media, no public awareness. We worked through the night, preparing for…whatever was coming.

Eighteen hours passed. Nothing arrived.

Confused, I reviewed the satellite footage again. The object hadn’t vanished—it had stopped a fraction of a second before breaching Earth’s atmosphere, then veered away.

The anomaly repeated itself over the next several weeks. Each time, the same pattern: a massive object would approach Earth at impossible speeds, only to disappear or change course at the last moment.

Then one day, the satellite feed cut out entirely.

When the connection returned, the data was…wrong. Instead of Earth, the camera was broadcasting footage of a completely unfamiliar world. A dense jungle, teeming with alien flora. Thick vines twisted through gnarled trees, and the air seemed to shimmer with heat and humidity.

At first, I thought it was an error—a corrupted feed or maybe a prank from one of my team members. But then, something moved.

They weren’t human.

A squad of figures emerged from the foliage, dressed in sleek black military uniforms, their faces obscured by reflective visors. They carried weapons unlike anything I’d ever seen—metallic, humming with faint blue light. One of them grabbed the satellite, inspecting it like they’d never seen anything like it before.

They spoke in English.

“What the hell is this?” one asked, his voice distorted by a helmet speaker.

“Looks primitive,” another replied. “Could be Euman tech.”

They took the satellite back to their base—a rusting, decayed structure buried deep in the jungle. Inside, I glimpsed monitors displaying strange maps, glowing symbols, and streams of data I couldn’t decipher.

Then I saw her.

An elderly woman in a lab coat, flanked by two armed soldiers. Her hair was gray, and her face was lined with exhaustion. She spoke in a low, trembling voice:

“We’ve lost contact with command. If the Eumans have breached the rift, it’s over.”

The soldiers didn’t respond. The woman turned toward the satellite, her expression shifting to one of horror.

“Is this…live?”

The feed cut to static.

I sat there, staring at my screen, my pulse pounding in my ears. I’d been recording everything, so I immediately sent the footage to my superiors. That was my mistake.

Hours later, I was summoned to a secure facility. Two men in black suits were waiting for me. They didn’t introduce themselves. They didn’t have to.

“You’ve seen too much,” one said flatly. “For national security, we’ll need you to come with us.”

I ran.

Now, I’m holed up in a motel room, typing this out while I still can. I don’t know how long I have before they find me. But listen—what I saw wasn’t just another planet. It was another reality.

Those people—those things—weren’t aliens. They were us. Or something like us. A parallel Earth, with its own wars, its own technologies, its own secrets. And they know we exist.

I can hear footsteps outside the door. If you’re reading this, it means I didn’t make it. But you need to know:

The multiverse is real. And something is coming.

May God Save us all!
