The phone screen dimmed, leaving me with only Rennick’s panicked breathing and the steady pulse of the chamber we were in.

Then the floor shifted – the water beneath our boots began to swirl, the tanks surrounding us quivered. From inside, hands pressed against the glass; there were at least hundreds of them. Their fingertips touched the surface before being dragged away by something else inside.

“Just… how many people were sent here?” I asked, but Rennick just shook his head.

The chamber rumbled, and one of the tanks cracked, spilling black, oily water across the floor. A body slumped out and hit the ground with a wet *slap*. Before we could move, it twitched – then bent upward unnaturally, with a tendril pulling on it from above. Its jaw opened as it looked at us, with more puppets falling out behind it.

I spoke first. “Maybe we should--”

“Run?” Rennick interrupted. “There’s nowhere to go here. This is an endless void of… nothing, except for tanks and these… things.”

The first body lunged, and Rennick swung it with his flashlight, the beam instantly shattering as it made contact. The thing collapsed into the water but kept crawling.

“We’re not going to make it out--” Rennick started, but his words cut off as a tendril whipped from the wall behind us and took hold of his arm.

“Fuck! Rennick!” I grabbed his other shoulder and pulled. The tendril stretched for a good 10 feet before snapping loose, the puppets now only a few steps away from us.

They stumbled forward, and behind them, the chamber itself opened – it wasn’t a crack in the wall or anything, but a *cavern* that seemed to go on forever. Although inside it was pitch black, vast shapes moved deep within.

*Subject MOTHER.*

Me and Rennick realized at the same time. We didn’t need to say anything to each other, but we knew – not only were we inside it, but we were inside its *core*. Or stomach.  

The floor beneath us buckled, and before we knew it, we were in waist deep water. It pulled us toward that endless cavern at the center of the chamber. The puppets stopped advancing – instead, they parted silently, creating a path for us to drift ahead. Their eyes were filled with nothing but a vast emptiness – these were once Order personnel, betrayed by the organization they trusted.

I couldn’t dwell on the thought too much – I raised my now soaked phone, hoping to see a message from someone – anyone.

But there was nothing – the signal bar was gone, and the battery was close to dying.

“We…” Rennick wanted to speak, but he was fighting the water trying to pull him beneath. “Need to…” I extended my arm, searching for him in the water to pull him up.

I was unsuccessful – and I was also pulled under.

The water swallowed me whole, my arms flailing around me uselessly as it drew me closer to the center. I closed my eyes tight, hoping to wake up in my bed and realize it was all a bad dream.

*Silence*.

*Breathing*.

I opened my eyes.

*Faces* – they drifted all around me, mouths open as if they were laughing at me.

*Depth* – below me stretched an endless abyss, something darker than I could have ever imagined. Something shifted below as I looked down.

I reached out and felt my hand brush against something.

*Soft* – the spongy surface trembled beneath my touch.

*Alive* – it reacted.

Something around me – I assume the walls – expanded with a groan, and I felt something press against my skull. I looked up, only to see the same endless abyss as down below.

Shapes moved in that void. At first, I thought they were buildings, something made of bone and muscle rising out of the dark. But they moved in ways that are impossible for buildings – they *bent* and *flexed*. Ribs, vertebrae, and the resemblance of muscle and flesh that made me forget everything leading up to this point.

And yet, despite its enormity, part of it leaned close – it wasn’t the head. I can only describe it as more of a mass filled with eyes and mouths. Each eye opened at a different angle; some were human, some far too wide, but all of them pointed at me.

I even tried to count them – I tried to measure the body so I could feed *some* information to my brain about this creature. But every time I thought I reached the end of it, the shape extended further and shifted closer to me.

It spoke to me. Not with real words or sounds, but with a quiet buzzing in my brain. That pressure I was feeling before now transformed into things I could interpret as messages.

**FEED.**

My body shuddered, though at this point, I wasn’t sure I had a body anymore. I was suspended in the air in a place I couldn’t wrap my head around face-to-face with a creature that shouldn’t exist.

In the distance, I felt Rennick’s presence. His panic was obvious to me, but the closer MOTHER shifted, the more distance there was between the two of us.

“Rennick?” I tried to call, but no sound came out of my mouth.

Another thought intruded, curling through my mind like a tendril: **YOU WERE GIVEN.**

Images I didn’t want to see slammed into my head – Order personnel in rows, their faces blank, one by one walking into MOTHER’s mouth.

My chest pulsed as if something had moved inside me, watching over all my thoughts and memories, tasting them. Another word filled the silence between us.

**STAY.**

I felt my memories peel back one by one – like going through a book about them. My childhood flashed before my – and MOTHER’s – eyes. Then my first days with the Order, my first partner. That damn trip to Madagascar. Every memory of mine was met with the same taste.

I tried to resist, to hold onto my thoughts. But each time I did, the eyes swarmed closer, filling in the void around me. Their shapes bent in directions that made me dizzy if I were to follow them.

“Stop-” I finally managed, but it sounded small and weak – nothing compared to the will of MOTHER pressing into me.

It didn’t want *me* specifically. It wanted everything and everyone I ever knew and loved. I felt my partner’s name slip away. Then the facility. Then even the thought of why I was here in the first place. The more I tried to focus on a particular thing, the easier it was for *it* to feast on it.

I was fighting against something I couldn’t defeat. Not without losing everything I loved.

And then, something else happened.

I saw a shape behind the eyes – and while it wasn’t as big or endless as MOTHER, it was enough to draw my attention to it, and, consequentially, the creatures too. MOTHER recoiled from it, and I could feel the pressure in my skull subside.

A foreign presence pushed through and I could finally hear someone else. Someone human.

“You’re not gone yet.”

This voice wasn’t in my head, though I still couldn’t place it anywhere around me. It was *against her*.

The words scattered across the chamber – and MOTHER seemed agitated at the intrusion. Her eyes – yes, all of them – started twitching and shuddering out of focus, searching for the source of the noise.

“You hear me, don’t you?” the voice continued, each sound seeming to hurt the creature physically.

The pressure inside my skull returned, but this time it felt calm. This wasn’t her, but someone else.

For the first time since entering, MOTHER finally backed away from me. The walls around us pulsed harder, trying to drown out the foreign voice.

But it didn’t work. “They left you here to die and feed *her.* But I won’t let you die for them.”

The void around me rippled. I felt a breath on the back of my neck – I *felt* it. I finally felt something *real* and *human*.

“Hold on,” the voice said, in a steady tone. “I’m pulling you out.”

I wanted to help somehow, but I couldn’t move. MOTHER, although now farther away, loomed around me, vast and infinite, her skin and eyes pressing against the edges of my mind. I could feel she hated that voice – and it gave me strength.

“You don’t belong to her,” the voice said.

Something bright cracked though the endless black – a thin white line tearing across the dark, like a wound itself opening in the chamber. I flinched and tried to shield my eyes, but I couldn’t look away.

The creature *screamed* – more or less, as it wasn’t an actual scream, but a painful vibration in the back of my mind that slowly seemed to leave my body, taking my memories with it.

“She’s trying to make you forget,” the voice warned, now urgent instead of steady. “Don’t let her. Anchor yourself. Listen to me and remember.”

The line of white widened. I saw the shape of a man standing beyond it, his figure warped by the line.

“Move!” he ordered. “While she’s far away!”

There was a moment which I can’t quite remember now – a second where her grasp let go of me. And all the memories she’d stolen came rushing back in a single, painful flash.

The next thing I remember was hitting solid concrete. The smell of saltwater filled my lungs as I coughed and gasped for air.

We weren’t in the facility anymore. The tunnels, the tanks and the endless void I floated in just seconds before were all gone.

Arthur was also there. He truly is real and alive, and not at all how the Order described him. He wasn’t insane or mad. Just another person shaped by the horrors he’d seen.

We talked for *hours*. About everything – his story, my story, MOTHER, about our plans and goals. About the Order’s plans. I know more than I should now, but I can’t write it down here. The Order will read this. And I can’t risk compromising the plan.

All I’ll say is this: I remember everything. Everything she tried to consume, everything they tried to hide. I don’t know where Rennick is – according to Arthur, he wasn’t there with me when he infiltrated the facility – but I refuse to believe he’s dead.

What I did learn, however, is that if someone survives MOTHER, they won’t ever be truly free again. I can still feel her, even far away from that place, she hasn’t let me go. I know that she isn’t caged and the Order is running out of ways to keep her content and fed.

I still hear her breathing in every one of my dreams. I still see her eyes around me, waiting for the perfect moment to attack. And sometimes, I wake up certain that I’m still inside [her](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThalassianOrder/).
