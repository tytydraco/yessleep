Ok I want to start by saying I’m very thankful to have work as I went an unfortunately long time without it. However there are a few things I need to vent out, and beyond the obligatory “my weird boss was an hour late even though they live on property” or “my coworkers keep eating my food” it’s been more than a little weird around here and I feel this is the best place to talk about it. 

I currently work as a night audit in what most would call a “seedy motel” and while it has gotten better over the years (so I’m told) it’s still not the greatest place, I started here around late January and while it was weird to begin with I got into a groove that allowed me to push through and look at it as a stepping stone job until I could find something I’m passionate about. Being that I had worked at hotels before it was easy to step into the familiar check in and check out process and then learning the ropes of new audit responsibilities I noticed I often had quite a bit of time to myself but don’t get me wrong I do enjoy this time it allows me to practice any hobbies I want or even sometimes play video game I usually don’t have much time for. 

During my last shift on however I did realize a few things that really struck me as odd and thinking about them gives me goose bumps. As a motel we do have a revolving door of regulars weather it’s jerry who’s up all night routinely telling me about how Elvis really was an alien in disguise or Johnny who fell on hard times and just started a new construction jobs and is here till he gets on his feet, one regular stand out ahead of all of them is the guy I can’t remember. I know it’s weird the regular that I can’t stop thinking about is the one I can’t remember but it’s true, he comes in every few days with exact cash and is there for one day but the strange thing is that I have no idea what he looks like as if as soon as he exits my field of vision I couldn’t pick him out of a crowd even though I was just talking to him. Tonight was especially off however because when he came on he said my name which wouldn’t usually put me off but it was the way he said it, it sounded almost angry and in the tone of a creaky stair case that had been smoking for twenty years. Other than that it was a normal interaction except on the way back to his room he stopped and looked at the security camera I can’t say how long I looked through that screen at him but I was shaken out of the security camera trance I was in by some crackling in my walkie-talkie, after that he was gone and I went to answer only to get a “I didn’t say anything” from my boss. 

Thats what got me writing this out I have other stories from my short time here but thinking of some of them still makes my hair stand on end so maybe I’ll put some others up, also have you encountered anything like this? Please let me know if so.
