I don’t know if this is a dream, a coma, or something far worse.

I just woke up in a hospital recovery room. The same one I woke up in three weeks ago, after a heart transplant. But everything that’s happened since — the fire, the dreams, the man with no face — it all felt real.

If you know anything about this… please, I need answers before it starts again.

I woke up to a blinding white light on the ceiling above me. I felt dazed and unable to move. I began to struggle to no avail, every movement seeming to put me into a deeper state of exhaustion. I tried to glance side to side, trying desperately to find out where I was. All I was able to see was a baby blue curtain and a bunch of wires coming out of a machine that seemed to be heading towards me.

The curtain pushed apart and through walked someone dressed in scrubs.

"No need to struggle, you are in the recovery room. You just had a heart transplant, and may I say it was one of the most flawless one’s ever completed. Almost as if the heart wanted to be a part of you." The doctor chuckled.

I slowly nodded my head and almost immediately dozed back off into sleep. The doctor returned to my room shortly later.

"The exhaustion should wear off soon. You will be under observation for a little, but the worst should be past you," he said.

I responded with a slim grin; what I didn’t dare to tell him was that I was feeling the exact opposite. My vision seemed more focused; there wasn’t a single part of my body that had any form of exhaustion in it. Honestly, it was the best I have ever felt. It was as if my entire body was being supercharged by electricity. However, when I looked past the doctor, I saw standing in the hallway a slim but tall man that seemed to appear out of nowhere. The man just stood there—nothing said, no movements—just looking. The doctor walked in front of me, breaking my view, and by the time he had moved, the man was gone.

About two weeks later, I was released from the hospital. Life seemed good. I was able to walk, run, sprint—anything I wanted. In comparison to before, when I could walk about 15 feet before a horrible pain would be released across my chest and bring me to my knees in agony. However, not all was perfect.

The dreams are the worst part. I would go to sleep only to find myself in a fiery pit, with demons pulling at my body, tearing and ripping at any part of me they could get their hands on. It was as if I was literally in hell. That part is bad, but the worst part is that when I wake up, the pain still lingers, as if my body just went through all of it.

I slowly began to get back into the swing of my life. I wake up, take about twenty minutes to recover from the previous night's dreams, and then start to get ready for work. I work at a small game store on the strip across from my apartment complex, so it was never an extremely far walk to get to work.

One day, as I was closing the store, I looked out the windowed front of the building, and what I saw shook me to my core. Standing across the street in front of my apartment was that same slim man. Still just watching, motionless. He now wore a slim-brimmed fedora on top of his head. However, I couldn’t see his face anymore, just his body. It was as if his face was only plain with no features. Just as before, I glanced away for a second and the man was gone. I ran across the street, looked up and down, and there was nothing there. It was as if he never existed in the first place.

I finished closing the store and walked back to my apartment. I went to unlock the door, and it just pushed open. I knew something was wrong. I left the door open and called the cops. While waiting for them to arrive, I went downstairs and started trying to search online for anything about the strange man. There was too much—everything from Skinwalkers to strange stalkers. All I knew is that there was no good explanation for it.

The cops arrived and searched my apartment. They found no signs of forced entry, or that anything was moved, broken, or stolen. They of course just chalked it up to me forgetting to lock it on my way out, but that wasn’t true. That was something I would never forget.

I didn’t sleep much that night, which weirdly I was thankful for because it saved me from the dreams of the pit. That day was just as boring as I hoped every day would be—went to work, came home, ate, took a shower, and sat on my couch watching some TV before bed.

As I was watching, I got a strange sensation in my chest. At first, it just felt like heartburn. Then it took a turn. It seemed as if my entire chest was engulfed in flames. I screamed and scrambled to try and get any relief from the burning. Then, just as suddenly as it started, it went away. I half expected to see burn marks on my chest after, but there was nothing. Shaken, I went and laid in bed, only to be welcomed into it by the demons yet again.

This time was different though. They were HERE. They walked around my room and prodded my sides with my own knives. They went into my kitchen and fried eggs on my burning flesh. I could see them, God KNOWS I could feel them, but I couldn’t do anything to move and stop them.

Then, they disappeared, and suddenly I could move again. I called off work and spent the entire day doing research. There was no link between anything that I was experiencing and my surgery. The closest that I could get was that my brain was aware of what happened to me, so it was coming through in my dreams. Nothing—NOTHING—could explain the fire that took over my entire body the night before.

I spent the day pacing my apartment, waiting for something, anything to happen. Nothing happened for almost the entire day, but right around 6:36 p.m., I saw him. The man. Standing right outside my apartment on the street, staring into my window. I knew for a fact now—he had no face. Not like it was just skin, but there was nothing. Like how a fire burns wood. You can still tell it’s wood, but it’s different, changed, never able to return to where it was.

Stunned, I backed away from my window, in a state of pure shock that I have never been close to feeling again. As soon as the man was out of view, the fire came back. Taking over my body, burning every square inch of flesh that I had. It was as if I dipped myself into a vat of lava, but I wasn’t. I was rolling around screaming in pain on my living room floor for what felt like hours.

Then, it was gone, just as it was before. I looked at the clock to see the time. 8:38 p.m. It had felt like hours—like the flames would never release me from their grasp. Yet only minutes had passed.

I began to wonder if I was dead. If I had died during the surgery and this was my hell, all it was going to take was for my brain to realize before I was left with the flames and the demons and nothing else for eternity. Suddenly, I collapsed. I contribute that to the shock of the man and the extreme pain that consumed my body. All I know is that I was weirdly happy it happened.

There were no dreams. Apparently, all you have to do is pass out and they don’t come. This is what made me realize that I wasn’t dead yet though.

"No way Satan himself is going to let me escape this pain just by passing out. He would want me to feel it," I thought.

I pulled myself up by my faux leather reclining chair that I fell next to, trying to find any sort of logical explanation for what was happening to me, but none ever came. As stupid as it sounds, I went to the Bible. I figured between the demons and the fire, if there was any chance of finding something, that would be where it is. Of course, though, I found nothing—just the mentions of what I was feeling in Revelations.

"This can't all just be in my head, can it?" I thought.

This led me to the internet—the answers to everyone’s questions according to the people on it. I searched and I searched, and eventually, I found it. One website with nothing but plain text on a white background. At the top, the title: *How to Bring Him Back.* The title was broad, the passages that followed were more so, but there was an upside. Through the vague passages and parts I could dissect, it described everything I was experiencing. The sleep, the fire, the man. What it didn’t explain though was why.

The last sentence as I read through said, *"When the heart is full and prepared by the fire and the servants, it must be removed and put back into its true body. You only have 3 weeks to do so."* That sentence. That damned sentence. I should have seen it then. If I had, the heart might still be mine.

That night, the last day of the third week, I prepared for the worst. I bought a shock bracelet that is supposed to help with sleep paralysis. I deadbolted my door and triple-checked that everything was locked. I filled a bucket with ice and placed it next to my bed in case that burning came back. But as I laid down to sleep there was nothing. No man, no fire, no incantations being spoken—just me and my empty apartment.

That was, until I fell asleep.

I drifted to sleep, and just as the many nights before, the demons came. They ripped and tore at me. They did everything they could to cause me pain.

Then there was a knock at my door. This was the first thing that told me something was wrong. No one has ever been a part of these dreams before. Another knock.

"WAKE UP, WAKE UP, WAKE UP," I screamed to myself in my head.

Then a third knock, and all went silent. The demons were gone. The door had no more knocks. But I was still unable to move.

That is when I saw my bedroom door start to open, and as I saw a long, lanky arm working its way through the crack, I knew who I was about to see. The man with no face pushed into my room—but this time, he did have a face. A handsome one at that. He looked like if every attractive male ever was morphed into one perfect man.

As soon as he came into view, the fire roared in my body—worse than it had ever been. He began to croak, "I can’t believe the time is finally here." I swore that I saw smoke coming from his mouth as he spoke. I tried everything I could to wake myself up. I felt the shocks from my watch, but they did nothing. I started to think that maybe I was still awake.

As the man came closer, the fire in me grew stronger and took more of me with it. It felt like the fire was burning me out of existence.

The man continued, "You have no idea what you are a part of, how long we have searched for the one who could nurture him how he needed. All he ever wanted was to be loved, and now, he has that… with us."

With that, the man pulled a knife out of his pocket. It was long and narrow—just as he was. In the reflection of the knife, I swore I saw fire coming from my body. He inched closer to me, the fire growing stronger, until he was at my bedside.

He leaned in close—so close I could feel the heat of his breath—and I swore I could smell cooked meat on it. He slowly whispered in my ear,

"The Lightbringer, the one true son, welcome home Lucifer."

He then plunged the knife into my chest. I would like to say I screamed, but the fire took so much from me I didn’t even feel it. He sliced and fileted and eventually got what he came for. He held my heart, black as ash, over me and said something in Latin.

Then, I woke up to a blinding white light, dazed and confused by the events that had just occurred. Then I looked to my side, and I saw stretched in front of me, baby blue curtains.

And this time, I didn’t feel relief.

I knew exactly where I was.

It had started again.
