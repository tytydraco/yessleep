The first note - just like the hundreds of notes that would follow it - was *completely* dry.

I shut off the faucet, dried my hands, briefly adjusted my tie in the mirror, and when I looked down, shit, there it was: a rolled-up square of loose-leaf paper, propped against the side of the drain, held tightly together by what appeared to be a strand of thin black thread or yarn. I pinched the end and dropped it in my palm. Dry as dust. Not an ounce of moisture on the damn thing. 

It didn't make much sense.

*“*Very funny...*”* I muttered, chuckling. The words simply reverberated around the empty men’s room. 

I twisted my neck side to side - nobody. 

I peeked under each stall, figuring I’d catch Tim squatting on a toilet, suppressing a wolfish giggle, but found no one. 

It was a strange prank, undeniably, but that wouldn’t exactly be out of the norm at *Happy Harlot Advertising.* 

*They must have lobbed it into the basin when I was distracted...* \- I thought.

Did that explanation make sense? No, not at all. I mean, if that was the case, why didn’t I hear the hinges of the bathroom door creaking? Why didn’t I catch a glimpse of someone in the mirror? Or, better yet, a glimpse of the note flying through the air? 

But I ignored those nagging questions and tugged at the thread. 

The note unfurled. I dragged my fingers across the paper. Whoever wrote it did so with force; so much force that they created tiny indents in the looseleaf.   

In jagged blue letters, it read: 

*“HE IS TRYING TO STEAL WHAT IS YOURS”* 

*“*Who? Tim?*”* I whispered.

My heart began to gallop. My thoughts grew feverish, imagining myself being fired for what felt like the millionth time. Visions of being replaced by Tim, a younger, smarter, more passionate version of myself: the inevitable upgrade. Pressure built along my skin. Hostile gravity threatened to crush me like a soda can disappearing under the wheel of a steamroller. 

I crumpled the note into a ball before it could do the same to me and launched it into a trash can. 

The thread, however, was harder to dispose of. Not only did it feel nice running between my fingertips, but, strangely, it made me feel safer in a way that's difficult to put to words. Same sort of safety you'd feel carrying around a lucky charm, I guess. I felt protected.  

And as long as I ignored one final question, that sense of protection would remain firm. 

*Why does this feel like hair...?*

I pocketed the strands and jogged out of the bathroom.

\- - - - -  

An hour later, Fox called my team to the boardroom for Tim’s presentation. I suffered through it with a pit in my stomach like I’d swallowed a cannonball. 

It was...good. 

No, that’s not true - his presentation was *great*. Genuinely remarkable. His proposal was innovative. His methodology was cost-effective. He sold it all with such zeal, such unshakable confidence. There was fire behind his eyes. 

That was his whole *schtick* \- passion. The man had convictions. He felt everything very deeply. 

*Must be nice.* 

I slumped back in my chair, faking a grin, toying with the hair in my pocket. When that wasn’t providing relief, I swapped to old reliable: my fidget ring. A mobile, spinnable band over a stationary inner band. A tactile outlet for my never-ending worry. 

Afterwards, Fox pulled me into his office and closed the door. 

*“*So - what’d you think? Pretty stellar work, no?*”* 

I paced around his office, avoiding eye contact, thumbing the hair in my pocket. Could Tim really be gunning for my position? It wasn’t the first time I had considered the possibility; the man’s a wolf. 

Every man’s a wolf. 

*“*Uh...Pete?*”* 

*“*Hmm?*”* I stalled my hectic pirouettes, unaware that Fox had sat down behind his desk. He gestured towards a nearby chair. 

I winced; lowering myself into the seat forced my hands out into the open. 

Reluctantly, I let go of the hair, spinning my fidget ring to compensate. A series of grinding *squeaks* emanated from my knuckle. Originally, the fixation was noiseless; time, friction, and inclement weather had rusted the bands to the point of musicality. I prayed the sound wasn’t bothering Fox. 

The CFO’s eyes narrowed. 

“*“*Right! Right...sorry.*..*Tim’s presentation...” 

I trailed off, distracted. Jagged letters scribbled in blue ink rocketed to the front of my skull. 

*HE IS TRYING TO STEAL WHAT IS YOURS*

“I’m getting the sense that you have...concerns?” 

I paused.

Then, a lie tumbled from my lips. 

“Well...some of the imagery looked...borrowed.” 

Fox leaned forward. His shoulders tensed. 

“You believe his work was plagiarized?” 

I scratched the back of my head, contemplated the potential ramifications of doubling down for about a quarter of a second, then nodded. 

“Alright then. Thanks for being transparent with me, Pete.” Fox closed his eyes and threw his glasses onto the desk. A sigh billowed from his lips. As I stood up, every inch of my body began to tingle. Liquid stress seeped into my veins. My heart rate violently accelerated. 

*What the fuck did I just do?* 

The rest of the day devolved into a hazy panic. Didn’t get a shred of work done. Instead, I split my energy right down the middle: half went to avoiding Tim, half went to keeping myself from vomiting. When I arrived home a jittery mess, Arden was quick to wrap her slender arms around my aching shoulders.

“Oh, I’m sure they’ll understand,” she said, running a tender hand along my side. When my fiancé got dangerously close to my pocket, I slid my fingers between hers and gently guided her away. 

“You made an honest mistake. Nothing more, nothing less.” 

Sleep evaded me that night.

I tossed and turned, writhing well into the morning hours like a man possessed. Contingencies required planning; I needed to practice how I’d respond in every potential scenario. The lies had to be second nature so I could focus on controlling my body language. 

Much to my horror, I encountered Tim in the parking lot the following morning.

He stomped past me, face flushed the bright red of a bell pepper, twitching, mumbling under his breath as he wrenched his car door open. The man sped away and he never came back. 

Later, I learned that when Fox confronted him about his presentation, he completely flew off the handle. Screamed his innocence loud enough that the damn whole office heard it. Even went so far as to hurl a coffee mug in the CFO’s general direction. It’s unclear whether he *intended* to hit Fox or not. Regardless, he had to duck out of the way to avoided being pelted by it. The mug shattered against the wall, leaving a pile of ceramic shrapnel in its wake. 

And that was that. 

Tim was fired on the spot. 

*Passion is as passion does, I guess.* 

At first, I was borderline euphoric with relief. Before long, however, that relief began to sour, and a certain unease trickled back into my skull. 

I was alone in the break room, rinsing flecks of caked-on lasagna from my Tupperware, helplessly lost in another mental labyrinth.

*Yes, objectively, it’s not completely my fault. If Tim had better control over his emotions, he’d likely still be working here. Still, I’m not blameless; I was the catalyst.* 

I only looked away for a moment. 

When I turned back, there it was, propped against the side of the drain, tied at the center by a strand of someone’s hair. 

Note number two. 

I plucked the dry scrap of paper from the basin and began unfurling it. 

*Then again, if he* ***was*** *trying to steal my job, my goddamned livelihood, then maybe a preemptive strike would be justifiable...ethically speaking...*

The hair was blond that time. 

\- - - - -

Over the next week, I decided the thing in the pipes needed a name. It's not that I was talking to Arden about it - God no - it’s more that names make things safe. 

*“*Rattle*”* seemed as good as any other. 

The more messages I opened, the more I received. The more I received, the more I was able to perceive the thing in the pipes. No matter where I was, I’d hear it: a dull, shaking rattle, like a pool ball clanking around the inside of a washing machine, radiating from the walls, or from the floor, or from deep within the earth. It wasn't continuous. If I heard the noise, that meant a delivery was imminent. 

Was the phenomenon disturbing? Seemingly impossible? Laughably absurd? Check, check, and check. 

But did I care? 

Not in the slightest. 

Rattle was helping me.

I likened them to a guardian angel, vigilant and steadfast, keeping an invisible eye peeled for the leeches and the predators that wished me harm, weeding the wolves from my company. 

I wasn’t *sure* that my sister was dead-set on convincing Mom to cut me out of her will. Granted, I had my suspicions, but I never had the evidence to prove it, not until Rattle came along. It was a similar situation with Calvin. Who would’ve guessed he had been calling me a hack and sell-out behind closed doors? I mean, I sort of did. The moment I left the band to focus on my career, his attitude towards me shifted 180 degrees. Cold, vacant stares. Forced smiles. Never sat next to me at the bar anymore. The changes were subtle, but they were there. I just needed proof, and the thing in the pipes was more than happy to oblige. 

Of course, Rattle wasn’t perfect: the notes often contained small clerical errors. For example, my sister’s name is “Meg”, not “Marge”. And the note about Calvin mentioned him despising me for leaving the “team”, when it should have said the “band”. Wasn’t a problem. In both cases, I knew what they were *intending* to say, and, far as I could tell, Rattle was right about those bastards every time, so what did it matter?

Months flew by.

During that time, Arden started growing distant. Strange glances from her side of the bed before she flicked the light off. Curt, loveless text messages. I feared the worst, but didn’t want to jump to conclusions. 

My fiancé was still at work when I heard a rattling below the floorboards that evening. 

I pushed myself from the couch, plodded into the kitchen, and stood over the kitchen sink. 

*Any second now.* 

There was a faint scent drifting through the air, one I had trouble placing. It was woody, but with a peculiar hint of sweetness. Eucalyptus with a drop of honey. Whatever the scent was, it didn’t raise any red flags. In fact, I found the phantasmal aromatherapy quite relaxing. As I waited, my finger stopped incessantly spinning my fidget ring, and the grinding *squeaks* stopped in turn. Silence blanketed our house. Even the muffled rattling had ceased. 

That silence didn’t last. 

Maybe if I had been paying attention, I would’ve noticed something was desperately wrong. 

*Did Arden really have to “stay late” at work tonight, or is that a cover? An alibi? Is she using again? Cheating on me? Could be both, no reason it couldn’t be -* 

A low, whirring clamor blared through the room. Cold metal cradled my wrist. Artificial wind pushed between my fingers, like the breeze from a fan cranked to its max settings.

My right hand was pressing into the drain. 

The garbage disposal was on. 

I leapt back, ripping my hand out. A searing pain exploded across my middle finger. Cereal boxes and cans of soup clattered against the floor as my shoulders slammed into the pantry shelves. Eventually, the discord settled. Excluding my labored breathing, the house was silent again; the whirring clamor had disappeared. Across the room, the switch for the disposal was in the “off” position. Never turned it on, never turned it off. A warm, slow ooze crawled down my middle finger. The alluring scent had been replaced with the sharp, metallic tang of exposed blood. 

Trembling, I examined my hand. 

A nickel-sized slice of skin had been cleanly excised from above my knuckle. The injury was superficial. No wound to sew back together; just a patch of raw, gushing tissue. I wrapped the finger with paper towels and crept over to the sink. 

A note was resting in the drain. The accompanying hair was silver and brittle. I opened it, surprised to find that there was a second note concealed inside the first. Rattle had never done that before. 

In jagged blue letters, the larger read: 

*ARDIN IS SLEEPING WITH HER BOSS*

In delicate black typography, that second, smaller one read: 

*It’s time, Pete. It’s time to come down here. It’s the only way I can truly protect you.* 

There was a flicker in my chest. A brief rebellion. An honest recognition of the outlandish situation I’d found myself in. Before that ember could bloom, however, it was snuffed out. 

A sweet, woody scent slithered up my nostrils. Eucalyptus and honey. 

My mind began to twist. 

*I can’t believe Arden is cheating on me...*

*- - - - -*

“Admit it! Just admit it!” I screamed. 

My fiancé ignored me. She continued to stumble around our bedroom, throwing handfuls of clothes into an open duffel bag, eyes red and glassy, cheeks coated with a sticky layer of dried tears. 

“There’s nothing to admit, Pete.” 

“Right, sure - then why the hell were you late?!” 

She swung around from her wardrobe and bellowed:

“Because we have a deadline, for Christ’s sake! I’ve told you this! I’ve told you this so - many - goddamn - times!” The screech of the closing zipper punctuated her appeal. She launched the bag out into the hallway and stomped past me. 

I paused the interrogation.

My consciousness felt divided, waging war with itself, each half intent on tearing the other limb from limb. Unequivocally, my body believed her. My marrow was on fire, screaming that I was making a mistake. My mind, however, would not yield. No plea would be enough. No evidence would be satisfactory. She was too perfect to have settled for me. Something had to be amiss. 

From behind me, I heard:

“Where the fuck is the Kindle charger, Pete?” Arden ripped open my nightstand’s bottom drawer. Normally, it required a key, but it was an old piece of furniture. In her rage, she’d pulled on the handle with enough force to break the aging lock altogether.

My righteous indignation evaporated. Waves of icy panic surged down my spine. 

She was looming over the drawer, rendered motionless by its contents. 

I kept the tufts of hair on one side and the notes on the other.

By that point, the drawer was nearly full. 

A bevy of useless half-words lurched over my tongue, none of which provided even a semblance of an explanation.

Eventually, I mustered something like: 

“I’ve been receiving...messages.” 

The only thing she said in response was: 

“But...this is your handwriting, Pete.” 

Arden slung the duffel bag over her shoulder and practically sprinted from our home. The front door slammed shut, and I was still in our bedroom. 

I was used to feeling relief after confronting people with what Rattle divulged to me, but that time was different. At that moment, alone in an empty house, I did not experience relief. 

I just felt hollow. 

The minutes that followed are a bit of a blur. 

I don’t think I passed out. Not fully, at least. I floated above my own body, but I couldn’t really see anything. Just shapes lumbering through a thick, blinding mist. I resigned myself. Embraced the detachment. I didn’t feel worth the trouble of it all: letting Rattle protect me was much, much easier. 

Then, it hit me. 

*What’s the point of protecting myself if I don’t think there’s anything worth protecting?* 

The paranoia untangled. The mist cleared. Painful remorse fell over me like a landslide. 

I peered down. 

I was in front of the sink. 

But the drain was triple the size it should’ve been. It nearly covered the whole basin. Thick globs of ash-colored fluid glistened around the quivering metal rim. Hundreds of thin, pearly needles lined the yawning cavity, jutting out from a material that had the color and consistency of velvet: crimson, plush, smooth.  

Rattle’s lips,

and Rattle’s mouth,

and Rattle’s teeth, 

and my right arm was elbow deep within the maw.

I attempted to yank myself out, but Rattle was too quick. 

The drain snapped shut, narrowing the exact diameter of my arm in the blink of an eye.

I screamed. 

Feebly tried to pull it out again, to no avail. 

Then, movement: 

The mouth began twisting. 

\- - - - -

The doctor was very interested in hearing how I managed to flay the majority of my right arm in such a spectacular fashion.  

Lying in the hospital bed, my stump wrapped in gauze, I informed her I’d be more than happy to explain, but she needed to answer one question for me first. The young woman nodded. 

I leaned forward and whispered:

“Behind me, in the wall, do you hear that?” 

The doctor let loose a nervous chuckle and assured me that sound was simply due to noisy plumbing. Initially, her response left me crestfallen, but then, without prompting, she added:

“I will say the noises in your particular room are a little...strange. Shrill. Scratchy… ”

“Almost like grinding metal?” 

She nodded again. I breathed a long, heavy sigh of relief. Best I figured, if she could hear it too - the fidget ring spinning inside the pipes in the walls - that meant I wasn't insane. 

It also meant Rattle was still following me. 

“Why do you ask? What do you think it is?” 

I laid back, flipped away from her, dragged the blanket over my head, and shut my eyes tight.
