As a child I was scared of the dark — now, I’m terrified of it. My partner, my friends, everyone asked me about it, curious about my childhood and the events that shaped me. I really wanted to answer, but it’s difficult to talk about, difficult to explain. So I kept it all to myself, no matter how it chewed at me.

This is why I decided to write about it instead, anonymously. About how I met my father for the first time — hiding in my closet.

I grew up in many neighborhoods. We never stuck around an area for long, and so I never had any friendships that lasted.

“Kyle, there’s one here as well,” Mother told me, as always.

“Another stalker, again?” I asked.

“Pack your things,” is all she answered me with.

I packed my travel bags — clothes, games, everything — and left it all behind again. There was no point arguing. It took a single comment or glance of interest of any man for Mother to deem him a danger. That time, it happened shortly after my thirteenth birthday — so we moved again, from a big city apartment to a rural village house.

Just as every building has an escape route, Mother always kept an eye on new rentals. We left within days, lived in the car for nearly two weeks, and moved into our next abode without ever having a walkthrough.

It was decrepit, awfully so. It looked like a one-star motel — the kind that could ruin an entire trip. Knowing we wouldn’t stay long gave me the push to open the front door.

Furniture sat on a rustic oak floor — pieces that might’ve once been expensive, if not for the chips and cracks. A wooden cross hung on the wall, something I associated with wasted Sundays. I set out to the second floor to look for a room to claim. Calling the place a ruin would’ve been an exaggeration, but back then it certainly felt that way.

I chose a room with a view onto the street. It already had a closet sitting on the blue carpet. It was old and unsightly, but nothing that stickers and posters couldn’t fix.

It took me the rest of the day to vacuum the carpet and carry in my things, while Mother went to buy food after locking the cellar door shut.

Later, I set up my air mattress, console and a nightlight to keep me safe. Moving as a child was intimidating, no matter how often I went through it. The first few nights in a new place always brought up vivid nightmares. Until Mother had gifted me the nightlight two years prior.

Mother and I, it had always been just us two. Ever since I’ve seen the light of day, my father has been absent. It wasn’t a topic Mother liked me to bring up. She never told me what kind of man he was, but I remember the one time she mentioned him. Once, after moving accommodations, as she put a padlock onto the cellar door, she said to me, “Don’t ever go down there. Your father’s work is highly fragile.”

Every time we moved, she’d lock the cellar door. If there was none, she’d lock a seemingly random room instead.

It scared me. Though perhaps — not as much as it should have.

The colorful, digital sandbox on my screen and the easy blue light of the LED separated my room, separated home from the strange, the hallways that felt alien during the day and malignant in the dark.

That night I went to sleep, illuminated by the soothing starry blue, marking my new home.

“Kyle.” The voice I heard was faint and full of breath. “Wake up, Kyle.”

I stared at the pitch-black darkness swallowing my room. I tried not to move, but even the slightest shift of my body caused the air mattress to creak and rustle.

It has always been us two. So who was that person creeping from my closet? His hand, now that my eyes had adjusted, moved like static to nudge the door wide open. He lurked in there, still just a shadow with bottomless eyes that seemed to grab me.

“A blackout has hit our house,” he said.

He knew of my presence, so I carefully asked, “Who are you?”

“I am the shepherd, you are my little plastic ground sheep,” he said, “Do you wish to know?”

“Know what?” I asked.

“What I’ve been working on all those years, I’ll open the door, and you’ll come and see.”

That’s all he left me with, all he said, before crawling deeper into the closet and closing the doors behind. I didn’t know whether he was still there, in my room. Still, I needed to leave.

I immediately stood up and tried the light switch, it clicked, but wouldn’t release me. The room remained dark. I looked out the window, searching for the safety of the serene blue moonlight, but it wasn’t there. The sky was empty as an abyss

I didn’t even dare to check the closet or go anywhere near it. And so my only choice were the corridors leading me further in. I searched for a flashlight, letting the weathered tapestries guide my hand. If only I knew in which room Mother set up her bed. The house is huge and I didn’t check and didn’t ask and now I fear screaming, for he might hear me disobey.

Unsuccessful, I went down the stairs to the first floor, ever closer to the ground and whatever’s below. There it was — the cellar door, wide open with a faint candle flicker inviting me down. I hesitantly grabbed the handle and with a wild beating heart, I pulled it shut.

All I wanted was to escape as fast as I could, and so I tried to seek the neighbor’s help. So, I tried the front door, only for it to reveal a staircase and faint candle flicker. Same with the kitchen door and even the windows. Every path led to the same place, as if fate decided to stop disguising itself.

I took a careful first step down, then another. Every step had me trembling.

“Why do we bury those we love, pull them further from heaven and raise a wall of dirt between them. Is it that heaven is further down and only the burial tradition is what remains of the truth or do we condemn them to the other place?”

I reached the bottom, a lone room with old beams keeping the dirt from pouring in. Candles, arranged like a path, pointed me to a hole in the ground with a coarse wooden cross beyond it.

I inched close, close enough to see inside, where Mother was sleeping.

“Mom?” I called out. “Mom!”

“Does it matter where she is? Whether there’s fire, or there’s the sky, there’s light regardless. So don’t be scared, my child, my plastic ground sheep, for there is a meadow with infinite grass to feed on, that I’ll guide you to.”

Forgive me, Mother, but I ran for my life out the front door that now let me enter into the moonless night, that would forever haunt my life with its deep, swallowing darkness.

And that’s the end of it. He let me leave, with the silent promise he’d return. The news never reported a pitch-black night, or houses with ritual graves in their cellar, straying my story further from any believability. As such, Mother’s disappearance and death was ruled unsolved. I hope that even if you don’t believe my tale, you’ll remember it.

I’m terrified of the dark — because even when the light returns, it’s never quite the same.
