I have been a con man for my entire life. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not particularly good at or enjoy this kind of work, but deceiving people is the only thing I have ever known. Still, for once, I want to tell my story honestly, as a confession, and perhaps beg you all for forgiveness.

I started my con artist career even before birth. My father, like myself, was a fraud and the worst kind at that. He was a religious fraud, claiming himself a Buddhist monk to seize his followers’ donation money. At my birth, my father had already made a name for himself as the chief monk of a rather influential pagoda in Vietnam. He often preached Buddha’s teaching of virtues, life, death, and rebirth, with his twisted additions of how people should donate more and more money if they want to escape hell and ascend to enlightenment. 

However, behind all those facades, my father was an alcoholic and a sexual predator. I was, in fact, one of his illegitimate children who he needed to take on as an adopted son to avoid legal actions from my mother’s family. Still, my father made the best out of that situation and paraded me as a poor, miserable orphan, which gained him even more donations from sympathetic yet gullible people. 

Despite being used as a tool, my childhood was still rather enjoyable. We got a lot of money, and my father, as much of an asshole as he was, cared enough to provide me material comforts. That was until the authorities discovered our scheme. It was a nationwide scandal, so we had to flee the country. We settled in a small village on the West Coast, where my father established another Buddhist pagoda, trying to recreate his former success. Still, the State is a different place. Our pagoda scheme never took off, and our family barely scraped by.    

Fast forward a few years. My father died of liver damage, no doubt a result of his alcoholic tendency. He left me the pagoda and the chef monk position, which I couldn’t care less about then. I wanted to be different, to become a better man than my father. But after a few years, I realized How cruel American society can be for an undereducated immigrant like myself, and as a result, I returned to the pagoda.

The problem is that I’m neither as charismatic nor confident as my father. He was a gifted manipulator who could convince anyone to follow his version of Buddhism and enlightenment. Yet, even he struggled to make ends meet. Meanwhile, I have only ever played the helpless orphan begging for others' money. I didn’t know how to attract new followers or maintain existing ones. The only thing I could do was indulge myself in drugs and alcohol with the remaining of my father’s money, hoping those chemicals would kill me before I starve to death.

I can never forget that fateful night when I first received His calling. The greatest mistake of my life and the downfall of our universe started like so many other regrettable stories: in a dark alley with some shady drug dealers. I was waiting for our local supplier with Ed, my best and only friend since childhood. He was the only one who knew me and my actual story beyond the devoted monk facade. While we shared the same hobby of drugs and alcohol, Ed somehow always managed to maintain his consciousness and acted as the voice of reason in our relationship.
“I don’t know, man, something seems off today. Nyan never took this long. Maybe the cops got him or something. We should head back!” - Ed told me, getting increasingly impatient with our dealer. “Besides, aren’t you having a ceremony tomorrow morning? I don’t think tonight is a good time for tripping.”

I knew Ed’s concerns were sensible, and I should just go home, prepare for tomorrow’s ceremony, and then take a good, long sleep. But, I was nervous and needed some LSD to calm my nerves. Don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t afraid of messing up the ceremony. Despite being a fraud of a monk, I had practiced those rituals my whole life, memorizing each step by heart. No, I was worried about my own conscience. Tomorrow's ceremony was to pray for the child of Mrs.Hai, a long-time devoted follower of our Pagoda. Her little girl, July, just got comatose after a car ran her over, and Mrs.Hai believed that if she prayed and donated enough, the Buddhas would cure her daughter.

The problem was I was neither a devoted believer like Mrs.Hai nor a stone-cold liar like my father. I genuinely felt terrible for July and wanted to help this sweet little girl get better instead of half-assedly conducting a ritual to take donation money like my father. Yet, I couldn’t force myself to believe that my prayers would have any meaningful impact on her condition. Even worse, I couldn’t deny Mrs.Hai’s request and tell her the truth because: one, I didn’t want to go to prison, and two, doing so would shatter her hope. The thought of tomorrow’s ritual, in which I must force up smiles and prayers while guilt and shame ate me up inside, dreaded me. I needed the comfort from LSD to forget my conscience and throw away my humanity. But I couldn’t say that out loud, even to my best friend, Ed, so I tried to devise vague excuses. Ed took none of it, but fortunately, Nyan arrived just in time and interrupted our conversation.

“Evening, gentlemen!”- Nyan greeted us with his usual upbeat and enthusiastic attitude, something rarely seen in drug dealers. Come to think of it, Nyan has always been the strangest dealer I have ever met. His name was unusual, his ascent and speaking style seemed too formal, and he always maintained an eerie smile and a carefree attitude. The man even tried every so often to strike up conversations with us. What kind of dealer does that!? Ed theorized he might be a population-controlling government agent selling drugs to kill off poor immigrants like us. Me? I always thought he used a fake name and was high all the time. Nevertheless, Nyan was our only option since we lived in a small rural village.

“You are late, Nyan. Hand over the usual stuff quickly so we can get the fuck out of this hell hole!” Ed couldn’t hide his impatience anymore.

“Relax, gentlemen! The night is still young!” Despite Ed’s clear annoyance, Nyan maintained his cheerful attitude. “It was my fault for arriving so late, but I have my reason. It took some time, but I have acquired a new, limited sample with extraordinary effects. I’m offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity tonight to be my first customer to try out this magical medicine!”

“Uhm, no, thank you. We will take the usual!” Ed replied coldly.

“Oh, but I’m so very sorry! I couldn’t manage your usual order today. The police have been active lately, so it was too dangerous for my supplier to deliver!”

“And you expect us to believe that even with cops on your tail, you still managed to find this ‘new and extraordinary product’? Bullshit!” Ed couldn’t hold his anger anymore. He turned to me. “Man, let’s get the hell out of here. He’s probably just selling us some cheap ass weed since he couldn’t find any real stuff!”

I should have listened to Ed and walked away from that alley, from that crooked dealer. But at that time, I needed drugs. I needed anything, and whatever Nyan was selling me, it would have been better than nothing.

To Ed’s surprise, I told the dealer: “Half the usual price, and we got a deal!”

“Are you crazy!? You don’t even know what he’s selling you!” Ed protest.

“I know, Ed, but I really, really need something right now!” I resist.

“Fine! Whatever! Just don’t say that I didn’t warn you, you stupid junky!” Ed stomped out, clearly pissed off.

I waited until my friend was entirely gone before continue dealing with Nyan. The dealer, maintaining his mysterious smile, brought out a bag of black powder.

“Great choice, my friend! I assure you won’t regret it. Now, for the product itself.” Nyan gave me the bag and then resumed his speech. “This new substance is strong, kicked in immediately, but causes no hangover and has no risk of overdose. Isn’t that wonderful!? And I heard this drug can get you as high as heaven, even meeting Gods themselves!”

“Yeah, yeah, whatever. Here is your money.” I couldn’t care less about Nyan’s advertisement. The only thing I cared about at that moment was getting high and forgetting about tomorrow’s ceremony. I gave Nyan his money, and we passed our way. 

After getting back to the pagoda, I immediately got to preparing the drug. I ground the powder into even smaller crumbs, laid them all into a straight line on my table, closed my eyes, and breathed them in. I kept my eyes shut, waiting for the blissful sensations to come, but nothing happened after 30 seconds, then 1 minute, then two minutes. I knew drugs often take some time to kick in, but hadn’t the dealer said that this one would go off immediately? Ed must have been right. Nyan must have sold me some cheap ass weed! I opened my eyes in frustration, planning to take some more. That was when I realized something. I wasn’t in my pagoda anymore.

I was standing atop a desolate mountain. At least, I thought it was a mountain because when I looked around, I couldn’t see anything but eternal darkness surrounding the pile of dirt I was standing on. Looking up at the sky, I could not see the moon or any stars. Looking down, I could see no water, tree, landmark, or even a piece of land aside from where I was standing. It felt as if I was looking into nothingness. 

“What if I fall? Will my body dissolve into the void? Can my soul even escape that darkness to rejoin the circle of reincarnation? Or will I be stuck there for eternity, accompanied by pure, primordial darkness?” As my eyes glued to the darkness below me, frightening thoughts uncontrollably flew into my brain. My subconscious instincts were on alarm, warning me that the void below was not something a human should see. I somehow felt a primal fear looking into the darkness, no, perhaps something even beyond human’s primal fear, as it was the fear of all existing creations, afraid of something that existed before the birth of this universe. 

Despite my mental efforts, I couldn’t force myself to close my eyes. It was as if the void had its own gravity, keeping my eyes in the same place. After a few seconds, I felt an invisible force on my body. The void was pulling my body closer to the edge. I did try to resist—I really did. But I soon realized that my attempts were futile, and whatever power this void had was far beyond us humans. 

I almost gave myself up to be consumed by the void when a star suddenly blinked into existence. Not a constellation, mind you, but a single dot blinking dimly on a vast ocean of darkness. The pulling force immediately stopped, and I dropped to the ground, dreaded and exhausted. I close my eyes, cursing Nyan with my entire existence for selling me that cursed chemical. 

Suddenly, I heard something. It was a loud, echoing *clink* sound, like a stone bell echoing through a vast but still enclosed space, reminding me of the bell we used to have back at my father’s old pagoda in Vietnam. I open my eyes again, trying to find the source of that sound, but to no avail. Darkness still surrounded me, except for that dim star. Looking at that star, I realized something. With its every blink, the sound echoed once. 

“Is the sound coming from the star? But how can it be?” I thought to myself. But as I continued looking at the star, something changed about the sound. It was still the *clink* sound, but somehow, inside my brain, I started to understand what it was saying. 

“nAMe…” The *clink* sound turned into a sound inside my head, repeating the word “nAMe” repeatedly with a foreign, Eldrich accent. Each time the star repeated the phrase, I could feel sharp pains bursting inside my brain as if my mind was trying to process some information it wasn’t created to comprehend.

“Name? You want my name? It’s ___!” I freaked out, my mind went blank, and I just shouted my name, hoping the voice would stop. Now, I know giving away my name was stupid, but back then, I had no idea how to deal with occult entities. I was just a con man, not an occult specialist. Thankfully, or perhaps unfortunately, the star didn’t care about my name. I continued repeating the word “nAMe” until my brain couldn’t take it anymore. I could feel every single blood vessel in my brain explode. The pain was unbearable, and I could do nothing but lie there, waiting for my demise. And then, as sudden as it began, the mountain top, the darkness, and the star disappeared, and I awoke on my bed, inside my pagoda.

I checked around, making sure I was really inside my pagoda. My body was on fire, and my head hurt like hell, but everything else seemed normal. “That was one hell of a bad trip.” I picked up my phone and called Nyam to get my money back. Whatever cheap ass weed he gave me had clearly resulted in that nightmare. For all I knew, I could have almost overdosed. That was the only explanation for why my fever and headache. But I couldn’t contact the man. I tried to call him a dozen times until I realized I was almost late for Mrs.Hai’s ceremony. So I packed my stuff and went to her house, thinking I would deal with Nyam later.

Since we lived in a small village, Mrs.Hai’s house was only a few walking minutes away from my pagoda. Despite still being tired, the fresh air did help to improve my mood. By the time I arrived at her house, I had almost brushed off last night’s encounter as a mere nightmare. Mrs.Hai was awaiting me outside. She respectfully bowed to me, a gesture I didn’t think I deserved, then led me to her daughter’s room.

Before the incident, the little girl, July, frequently visited our pagoda with her mother. When my father was still alive and I didn’t have to conduct rituals myself, I often babysat her while Mrs.Hai prayed inside. After I became the chef monk, she still dropped by usually, bringing me fruits and vegetables. Unlike the elderly followers, July didn’t give me those stuff as offers to ask the Buddhas for something in return. Instead, she gave them to me because she worried I didn’t have time to take care of myself. I wouldn’t dare call July my friend since I could never reveal my true self to a poor, innocent girl like her. But aside from Ed, she was one of the few people I genuinely cared about.

A car ran over July a month ago. The driver escaped, and the local police failed to find him. It was a miracle she survived, but falling into a coma wasn’t a better fate. After a month in the hospital, July’s condition remained unchanged, and Mrs.Hai couldn’t afford to have her there anymore, so she brought her daughter home, seeking help from the divine.

I had never been a believer. Despite spending my whole life preaching about karma and enlightenment, I could neither understand nor believe in my own teaching. If karma was real, what would a sweet, innocent little girl have done to receive this fate? If the Buddha existed, why did July suffer her gruesome fate while some drug-addicted con man like myself lived lavishly? The more I thought about it, the more I realized I was mad at myself, not the Buddha. I hated myself for being so useless, for failing to save this little girl. Yet, despite my raging inner thoughts, I still processed with the ceremony. 

I chanted the Buddhist sutra while holding one hand over July’s forehead. I repeatedly called different Buddhas' names, genuinely praying that they could answer my call and make this girl better. With my other hand, I rang a small bell as part of the ritual. I had heard its ringing sound thousands of times before, but that day, something was different. The sound echoed throughout the room, growing eerily similar to the sound in my nightmare. Before I realized it, an alien voice had formed inside my mind, repeating the word “nAMe.” 

I freaked out. The memories of my nightmare flushed back into my mind. “What if it was no nightmare?” “What if I truly met some alien, primal being?” “Is it still coming for me?” I was overcome with fear. But then, something came to my mind. The entity I encountered had power. It was the only being with actual power that I had actually interacted with, not through some sutras or transcripts. What if I could ask for its power to cure July? It constantly repeated the word “Name”  but didn’t want my name. Then, perhaps, it wanted me to name it.

It took all my courage to continue the ritual. Mrs.Hai seemed concerned that I almost fell to the ground mid-ceremony, but I made up some nonsense about giving her too much energy. I put my hand back on her forehead and continued chanting Buddhas’ names. But this time, I added another name, something I thought would fit my nightmare entity.

“Pray to the *Star Above Darkness Buddha*!” I exclaimed. Immediately, I felt something like an electric curtain running through my whole body. I lost all my strength and fell head-first into the ground. Mrs.Hai ran toward me, planning to help me up, but her attention was immediately turned to her daughter, whose eyes were now wide open.

“Mother? And Venerable? What are you doing?” The girl sat upright as if the accident had never happened. Mrs.Hai ran toward her daughter, embracing her with all her strength. Lying on the floor, I was also overjoyed to see July’s miraculous recovery. But my happiness quickly wore off as I realized what I had done. I congratulated July and her mother, then made up some faint reason and dashed back to my pagoda.  

For the next three days, I locked myself inside the pagoda. Despite being a religious fraud, I had heard Buddhist and Christian stories of demons giving humans temporary power in exchange for their souls. I spent entire days kneeling before Buddha’s altar, praying to them to save my soul from evil. I dreaded going to bed every night, fearing waking up on that cursed mountaintop. I almost reached my breaking point on the third day when I heard a knock on the door.

“All right, if that devil comes to claim my soul, then so be it!” I thought to myself. “If I have to die and suffer eternal punishment in the afterlife, at least I must know if July is saved!”

When I opened the door, to my surprise, July and her mother brought me food and fruit.

“We came to express our gratitude, Venerable.” Mrs.Hai started. “We should have come sooner, but July needed to undergo some examination first.”

“The doctors said it was a miracle, but I know it was thanks to you, Venerable!” July continued. “I remember before waking up, I was in complete darkness. But then, a star suddenly appeared amid the darkness. It was only dimly lit, but its light was so warm! I followed the star, and before I knew it, I was home.” 

“We brought these offerings for the Buddha. And of course…” Mrs.Hai took out a money envelope. “... for you. Not much, but these are what we have left. Please take it! We are forever in your debt!”

I introduced Mrs.Hai and July to pray the Buddhas before sending them home. Somehow, July remembered the name *Star Above Darkness Buddha* and included it in her prayers. Mrs.Hai was initially confused since she hadn’t heard of this Buddha her entire life, but she soon remembered that I had chanted this name when curing her daughter. Thus, Mrs.Hai also chanted: “Pray to the *Star Above Darkness Buddha*!”

After the pair left, I felt a sense of joy and relief. Hearing Joly’s gratefulness was the first time I ever felt accomplished. For once in my life, I actually achieved something, actually saved someone! That feeling rushed through my body, more addictive than any LSD I ever tried. I wanted to save more people, to be a hero! And I had the power to do so! Perhaps the star wasn’t a malevolent entity as I thought, but a Buddha who finally contacted me after all these years. 

As if answering my questions, I dreamt of the star the second time that night. This time, I was still on that mountaintop, surrounded by darkness. However, the star seemed to shine brighter than before. It blinked, and the *clink* sound echoed through space. Just like last time, a voice formed in my mind, but this time, it sounded less foreign and more like a human voice, albeit slow and asleep. My head wasn’t hurt at all, unlike last time, and the voice spoke in an almost complete sentence:

“Help… more… people…”

 “So you want me to help more people? But how?” I asked.

“My… name… Power…” The entity replied, confirming my suspicion. Whenever I chanted his name, *Star Above Darkness Buddha*, he would give me a piece of his power.

The following day, I woke up feeling more alive than ever. My life finally had meaning! I finally had a purpose! I immediately started searching the internet for patients in deep comas or suffering from incurable diseases. I contacted their family, explaining that my prayers could help their loved ones recover. Most people ignored my messages, but some were desperate enough to try. 

Thus, slowly, I used the name *Star Above Darkness Buddha* to help more and more people in need. Most of my patient expressed their gratitude through hefty sums of money. Some stayed with me, eager to learn the way of the *Star Above Darkness Buddha*. We formed a small group to reach out and help even more people. Those were the happiest days of my life, and I will pay any price to return to them. But things soon turned badly without me even realizing that…
