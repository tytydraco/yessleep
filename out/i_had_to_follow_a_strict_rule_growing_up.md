So a couple of years ago when i was still a kid, i actually had my own bedroom, cause i was an only child, and whilst growing up, i always was told to never, EVER, open the locked closet in my room.


i always followed this rule as i was scared of something happening, but i never got enough courage to ask about it.


Every night, when i would try to sleep, i would always hear a strange noise coming from the closet, but i never asked about it, because i was scared of anything happening.


for days, i would hear the closet door being scratched, like a dog was scratching it... but i still never asked about it fearing i would get punished.


days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months and months turned into years, every day i would hear a desperate voice inside the closet "Please let me out" with a very deep and non-human sounding voice, followed by scratching, and other weird noises that were generally hard to make out, such as the sound of an animatronic robot moving, and so forth.


when i turned 23, i was ready to move out of my dad's home, i had planned the apartment i was gonna live in and was generally having a good time spending the last couple of days in my parents' home.


but, eventually a couple of days before i was going to leave the house, i received a call, i had just been fired from my job.


that night i couldn't sleep, i was very angry and filled with rage, i just lost my job.. and the noises in the closet weren't helping me at all during my low, and eventually i got very angry and decided to open the closet, and god forsaken i wish I hadn't.


as soon as the closet opened, i could notice, there was nothing in the closet, not clothes, not anything, it was completely empty, but one thing i noticed, was that as soon as I opened the closet door, the entire room felt, cold.

the whispers in my ear kept getting louder, as the breeze coming from the closet hit me, but i stood there, powerless, realizing what i had just done.

i couldn't even control my body. i was in complete shock.


i eventually got control of my body and managed to control myself, and at that point, i had regretted my decision.


i booked it out of the room and packed all the important items into my car, as i screamed "Dad!", but there was no response.

i eventually felt a sense of fear and trusted my gut with the fact i should get out of there.


i drove to a friend's house and begged for him to let me stay for a couple of days, i was so shaken i couldn't even explain the situation to him.

and that entire night, i couldn't sleep. i just couldn't, when i tried i would hear whispers in my ears, and my own brain driving me insane with hallucinations... but i managed to sleep eventually.

and that night, the dream i had was terrifying...


i had a dream where i was sitting in a sort of clearing, it looked very deep into the woods, and it was snowing, for some reason, and i was strapped to a chair, it looked like an electric chair, only that it couldn't produce any electricity.


i could notice, the shape of a person far away, as the silhouette got closer, i realized, it was my dad.

he came up to me, and in a muffled non-human voice said "WHY" as he started to cry and fell on his knees, begging for forgiveness, but it was no help, before a black fog (like gas) covered him and he disappeared into thin air, and i could notice, the gas was coming towards me....


it hit me and i immediately woke up, and i was sweating, but i noticed that, the part that the black fog hit me in the dream, was black in real life...

i could notice my entire body going black, i would lose the power to control the parts which were affected... i had lost.. 

i could feel as if i got disconnected from my body, watching it rot from far away.. before i had completely forgot everything afterwards.... i woke up and felt weak, i could still use my body, and that gas like thing hadn't affected me, or did it?


i felt like nothing. i could barely move. and the doctor couldn't identify what was wrong with me, so he told me to wait a couple of days and it should go..

thankfully it did, and it's been a couple of years since that incident, but I'm still thankful I'm alive... i still have unexplainable occurrences in my life however... but i can still get on, i would appreciate any tips to stop myself from going insane.


it feels like there's something, but when i look there's nothing... i feel like i am being watched...
