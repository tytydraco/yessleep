 I found myself driving down a desolate road, raindrops splattering against the windshield in a chaotic symphony. Fatigue had set in, my eyelids heavy, and my grip on the steering wheel slipping. It was in that moment, a mere heartbeat away from disaster.

My body tensed as the blinding headlights of an oncoming car careened toward me, seemingly out of nowhere. Instinctively, I swerved to avoid the collision, my heart pounding in my chest like a tribal drum. Time seemed to slow as my car skidded, tires screeching in protest against the wet asphalt. Miraculously, I managed to avoid the collision, but the car behind me careened off the road, disappearing into the night. Shaking with adrenaline, I pulled over and got out, expecting to see the wreckage and injured passengers. But to my utter confusion, there was no trace of the accident. No mangled metal, no broken glassâ€”just an empty road stretching into the distance.

After a long pause of panic and confusion, I continued on my way. The rain subsided, as I arrived home.

The next morning, I woke up as usual, with the immediate need to relieve my bladder. After taking a quick glance in the mirror while washing my hands, I paused and turned my head left to right, carefully inspecting my facial features. My reflection in the bathroom mirror appeared subtly altered, with my eyes appearing darker and my jawline slightly sharper. "Did I lose weight? Huh, I didn't even notice," I thought to myself. Gleaming with a boost of self-confidence, I got dressed and ventured outside, even though I couldn't find my phone. I had plans to meet up with friends at the bowling alley, and not being able to find my phone wouldn't be a good enough excuse for them to not kill me for bailing. They took bowling seriously. 

When I arrived, I immediately noticed something peculiar about them. Let me explain why this is peculiar: I just saw both Dan and Kate three days ago, but their appearances had noticeably changed. Kate had newly dyed her hair a vibrant shade of blue, and Dan now suddenly had a man bun when I could of sworn he had short hair just 3 days ago. "Kate wasnt even going to ask my thoughts on her newly died hair?" I pondered.

Curiosity and concern welled up inside, and I couldn't resist mentioning the changes. "Hey, I like your new hair color!" I exclaimed, pointing at Kate's blue hair. "And since when did your hair get long enough to be put in a bun, Dan?"

My friends scoffed. "New? I've had this hair color for months! You really don't pay enough attention to us, do you?" Kate replied, rolling her eyes. "I've been growing my hair out for like six months, and I didn't exactly hide it. Are you feeling okay?" Dan sincerely asked.

I blinked, trying to dismiss it and laugh it off, but the disconcerting feeling wouldn't go away. Even the way they spoke, their voices felt slightly altered. It sent a chill down my spine. I thought I was losing my mind, my anxiety playing cruel tricks on me. I tried to rationalize the changes, convincing myself that stress was distorting my perception. But no. Something was not right. I made up some excuse about needing to pick up my mom's prescription for her before the pharmacy closed and left abruptly.

However, as the evening continued, my sense of unease grew stronger. I reached into my jacket pocket, searching for my phone again, to no avail. "Where did I leave that fucking thing?"

 I muttered to myself, but something else felt off. The zipper, which had always been on the right side of my coat pocket, was now on the left. It was a small detail, but it felt profoundly wrong.

But the anomalies persisted. I felt more disoriented and frightened, struggling to make sense of what was happening. People around me spoke with slight differences in their speech patterns, their voices subtly altered. The once-familiar world now felt like a distorted reflection in a funhouse mirror.

I was no longer able to brush off the changes as mere figments of my imagination. I plunged into a state of paranoia, questioning my sanity. I wondered if my mind had been irreparably shattered by the near-collision. 

Days bled together, and the anomalies multiplied. I couldn't remember what was normal and what was slightly different. The fabric of my existence felt unraveled by forces I couldn't comprehend. 

It's been days since I even left the house or talked to anyone so in a desperate attempt to regain some semblance of normalcy, I retraced my steps, returning to the place where the near-crash had occurred. It was a desolate stretch of road, haunted by memories of that fateful night. The rain had long ceased, but the atmosphere remained heavy with an eerie stillness.

As I stepped out of the car, a strange glimmer caught my eye amidst the damp grass. There, lying partially buried, was a phone. An inexplicable mixture of hope and dread swelled within me as I picked it up. The screen flickered to life, illuminating my face with an eerie glow.

To my disbelief, it was my missing phone, the very device that had vanished without a trace. The screen displayed a 13 percent charge remaining, not bad considering it's been here for so long,  I had countless missed calls and notifications, all from the past few days. I began to scroll through the messages and notifications, desperately seeking answers.

With trembling hands, I first opened up Facebook, which weirdly had 99+ notifications, and my heart sank in disbelief as I read the first few posts on my feed.


 "Rest in peace" and "We miss you" posts flooded my timeline from friends and family, apparently mourning my supposed demise.
