The chilling wind cut through the darkened woods as I trudged through the underbrush, my flashlight casting eerie shadows on the gnarled branches. It was one of those nights when the moon hid behind a thick blanket of clouds, adding an extra layer of dread to the atmosphere. I was Sheriff Thompson, and tonight, like many others before, I was heading to the same abandoned house deep within these haunted woods.

The locals had warned me about the house, tales of its malevolent presence circulating through the town like whispers on the wind. They spoke of strange happenings, of apparitions and unexplained phenomena. But being a man of reason and logic, I dismissed those stories as mere superstitions. Yet, as the calls kept pouring in, I couldn't ignore the pattern anymore.

The house stood against the backdrop of towering trees, its once-white paint peeling and crumbling away. The windows were shattered, and the door hung limply on its rusty hinges. The porch sagged under the weight of time and neglect, as if it were being slowly consumed by the darkness surrounding it. It was a relic of a forgotten era, harboring secrets that refused to fade away.

Each time I stepped into that house, a sense of unease washed over me, crawling up my spine like icy fingers. The interior was nothing short of a nightmare. The air was heavy with dust and decay, the silence broken only by the creaking of the floorboards beneath my boots. The walls were adorned with faded wallpaper, peeling away to reveal the decaying structure beneath.

The first few visits were routine, responding to reports of trespassing or vandalism. But as the nights wore on, the situation escalated into something far more sinister. I would often find signs of recent habitation—food wrappers, blankets, and even fresh footprints in the dust. But there was never anyone there, just an empty void that seemed to mock me.

On those nights, the house came alive. Whispers echoed through the hallways, as if the very walls held secrets they were desperate to share. Shadows danced in the corner of my eyes, darting away whenever I turned to face them. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end, my heart pounding in my chest. It felt as if I were being watched, scrutinized by an unseen presence that reveled in my discomfort.

One night, as I investigated a particularly unsettling noise upstairs, I stumbled upon a room I had never seen before. It was hidden behind a hidden panel, concealed from sight. The room was small and cramped, barely big enough to fit a bed and a dresser. But what caught my attention was the collection of photographs scattered across the floor.

I picked one up, the image within freezing the blood in my veins. It was a picture of me, taken from a distance. I could make out the details—my uniform, my badge. The realization hit me like a freight train. The house was not just some abandoned relic. It was alive, a malevolent entity that drew me in, playing its sick game with my mind.

From that moment on, I was consumed by an obsession to uncover the truth. I dedicated countless hours to researching the history of the house, digging through archives and interviewing the few remaining elderly residents who remembered its past. The house had been owned by a reclusive family, plagued by tragedy and madness. The patriarch had descended into madness, ultimately taking the lives of his wife, son, and his new born daughter. Then after he was done slaughtering the people that loved him most, he ended his own life in the kitchen. Locals say his body was hanging for over a year before he was found due to the rural area of the home. 

Anyways, let’s get back to my story. I stopped by a bar semi close to the home and asked around to learn more about the house, I learned that the man’s grandparents had built the place in the late 1800s. They say that the grandparents are responsible for the houses madness and abilities, I also heard that the house had a heart. This wasn’t confirmed by all the locals as some were skeptical, but the ones who believe in it say that in the basement if you destroy the heart, the houses curse will be broken. So i made it my objective to locate that heart, and destroy it as soon as possible. The next morning i checked in at the station and decided to bring my partner with me, his name is Dan, or was Dan. Me and dan have been good buddies since about 8th grade, we used to cause hell in the classroom and all of our teachers said we would amount to nothing, funny I arrested my old math teacher Mr. Johnson for something I wouldn’t share on here.

Anyways me and Dan brought a shotgun each, and of course our colt pythons. We drove out by the woods of that terrible home, and had to continue on foot. As soon as I got close to the house I got that ominous feeling, like somebody or something is watching me. I can tell Dan felt it too as he started shaking a little bit. We pushed open the creaky, damaged door and entered the home. Me and Dan cleared every room before finding the basement on the very end of the hall to the left. As we opened the basement door and descended down the splintered, rotted wood steps, Dans leg fell through the 3rd to last one. He managed to pull it out and no harm was done to him, but it did shake him up a little bit. As soon as we were on the ground floor of the basement a beating sound was heard. Like when your heart pounds in your chest type of beating, we immediately knew what it was, the heart. As I withdrew my python Dan did the same. The basement was pitch black and only illuminated by our flashlights. As we turned the corner I located the “heart”, it looked nothing like a heart. It looked like a ball of meat you slap on a pan when you’re making a smash burger. But it throbbed violently as the noise got louder, me and Dan decided that shooting at it should get rid of it quick and easy, but man, we were wrong. Dan cocked his revolver back and fired at it, but the bullet reflected right off of it and hit him in between his eyes. I was frozen in place, a fear and sadness overcame me as I lost my childhood friend, my partner, and now i’m alone in this wretched place.

I bolted up the stairs, around the corner, and ran straight into the door. Knocking it off of its old hinges, i phoned my boss and told him I am done working for him, I drove and didn’t stop unless I needed gas for two days. I am now living across the country, in a nice suburb with my wife I met here years ago. But it’s been hard to sleep, almost like something is watching me, like it followed me here.
