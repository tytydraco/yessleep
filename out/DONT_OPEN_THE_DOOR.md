Don't open the door.

A few years ago I was home alone and would be for a while. My family was on vacation and I had work so I couldn't join them. I was fine with that, I was happy to have the house to myself. 

But on one of the days, I was doing my chores, cleaning up around the house and I found a door. Not a regular door, not a door that should've been there, but on the wall of the spare bedroom in the basement, there was a door. It should've led into the wall, into dirt, but there it was. It was made of a dark brown wood, with intricate engravings of green in each of the corners, and a large handle made of gold or brass. In the centre was a engraving in gold of the sun.

I ignored it at first. It was weird, it made me uncomfortable, but I just didn't think about it and that solved the problem at first. It disappeared after that first day, at least for a little while. I didn't see it the next few days. 

But maybe 4 or 5 days later, it was back. I was in my room playing some games and a heard a thump. I got up slowly and took a few steps out of my room. A few seconds later--

--THUMP!

As i walked through my house, I realized it was coming from the basement, and sure enough. When I went down there, there it was, the door, sitting nicely in its frame on the wall. Every 30 or so seconds it came-- 

--THUMP!

I moved the spare bedrooms dresser against the door. And the chair, and the bedside table. Everything but the bed I blocked the door with. The thumping continued, but I, satisfied with my barricade, went back to my room and put my headphones on a little louder this time. 

A few days later the door disappeared, and it was quiet in the house again. It took a while before it came back, maybe a week went by, I'm not sure. But this time, it returned with a vengeance.

I was asleep in my room upstairs when it happened. It came back with a rhythmic thudding this time. Faster and louder than last time.

THUD! THUD! THUD!

THUD! THUD! THUD!

I got up from my room and threw on some proper clothes to go investigate. I grabbed my knife just in case and went downstairs. The thumping continued, angry, as I walked through my house. When I got downstairs and to the door it was deafening. 

THUD!! THUD!! THUD!!

THUD!! THUD!! THUD!!

I could make out what sounded like scratching coming from the other side. I thought about calling the police, but how would I have explained it to them. 

I couldn't go back to sleep with it like this, so I sat on the bed in that room, put on my headphones, and stared at the door, horrified, but even more scared to turn away from it. I held my knife in front of me, and waited. I sat there for 17 hours, waiting for something to happen, and finally, after waiting. The thudding stopped. It went quiet. I closed my eyes, and fell asleep instantly, exhaustion flooding my body as the adrenaline left.

When I woke up the door was still there, but it was quiet. I went up to the kitchen and made myself some food. Starving after waiting for so long, and packed a backpack with some water and snacks, a flashlight and batteries. I was going to find out what was going on behind that door. 

I went downstairs, cleared the barricade I made and stood in front of the door. My hands trembled. This was an incredibly stupid idea. But I was young and trying to be brave.

I put my hand on the handle. It was ice cold. Like it had been sitting in -60 degree weather for days. I twisted it, and pushed it open. It was pitch black inside. I flicked on my flashlight and shined it inside. It was a dirt tunnel, sure enough, but it curved upwards near the end. I walked in and towards the curve and it led to the surface. The exit to the tunnel was thin and hard to get through. I had to crawl through in all fours and still barely fit.

As I crawled out onto the surface, it wasn't my front yard like it logically should've been. It was the middle of a forest, and my house was nowhere to be seen. I stacked some rocks and sticks to make a little marker for where the tunnel was and set off. Just wandering in the direction I was looking when I climbed out of the tunnel. I was in a massive forest, with trees at least 5 meters in diameter, stretching up into the sky. They made a canopy that let little sunlight through, so the ground was mostly dead leaves, fallen logs and mushrooms. No grass or flowers.

As I walked, I heard no birds, saw no squirrels or rabbits or even bugs. Just endless forest in every direction. I was marking trees as I passed them with my knife to keep track of where I was, but with how many trees there were, I wasn't confident it would help. 

Eventually, I came upon a small cabin in a small clearing. With no other points of interest, I decided to check it out. I walked up to the door and knocked. 

Thud… thud… thud

No response. I pulled the handle, and it opened. It was a dimly lit one room cabin. A table sat in the middle, with differnt bottles and bowls stacked together and an oil lamp lit in the middle. To the right was a small kitchen, with cupboards and a wood stove. On the left was an old bed, only big enough for one person. Planters hung from the ceiling, dried herbs and plants were strung up, and a few paintings hung around the room. As I looked around the room, it felt lived in. It felt like I was intruding and yet it was so safe. But as I breathed in the air of calm that permeated the room--

--CRAK!
The sound of a stick breaking cut through the silence.

Outside, the sound of panting and footsteps was loud, seemingly amplified by the cabin I was in. I looked to the window and walked slowly to the side and cracked the blinds slightly for me to look through. Outside, a massive creature stood there. It seemed to be almost humanoid, but it wasn’t. There was no way. It had 2 arms coming from its shoulders, but a third stuck out of its lower chest at an unnatural angle, its joint unattached as it hung there limp. Its hands had long claws on each finger, sharp and dripping. Its legs long and thin like an animals, but the right ankle split two ways into two feet that it seemed to balance with its third. The left foot ended in a hoof while the others looked like a wolf's. Its tail was long and sleek, thin with a barbed point at the end. Its whole body was hairless and reflective, like it had a layer of water on it. 

It glanced around quickly, its deep breaths wet and whistling as its mouth was missing, replaced with a hole that was always open and leaking saliva, turning each breath into a hollow sounding howl. Inside the hole was a row of teeth, each serrated and sharp, glistening in the low light. Its head was round and smooth but I couldn't quite make out any details past the mouth.

It wandered around the clearing a little longer before running off into the woods. I took that as my chance. I shouldn't be here. I had to leave. I opened the door and ran. Back the way I came. Back to that tunnel. Back to the door. It must've heard me. I could hear sticks cracking and a deep guttural roar as the somethings footsteps thudded like thunder against the ground. 

I tried to run, but it was faster. I glanced behind me just in time as it came into view from behind a tree and twisted its body, before lashing out with its barbed tail. I dove forwards, out of the way. Its tail pierced a tree, before tearing it out, showering me in splinters and bark. 

On the ground now, I tried to scramble away but it leaped onto me. I closed my eyes, its breath heavy with the scent of rot and metal. Its saliva dripped onto me, slimy and rancid.

I opened my eyes as it raised its tail above my head, ready to skewer me. As it did, in a last ditch effort, I grabbed its limp third arm and jabbed the small knife I brought with me into the spot it connected to its body and pulled. Its arm came loose, tearing the skin as I cut with the knife. Blood poured out onto me, warm and slick. The creature screamed, a blood curdling, hateful scream. Every hair on my body stood on end. My ears rang and started to bleed. A warm trickle of blood running down the side of my head.

I turned over and crawled out from under it before getting up and running, the thing still reeling. Its arm held on by threads. It looked at me and I saw it had no eyes, just a smooth patch of skin above the hole that made that horrible noise.

I ran. 

And ran. 

And ran. 

I didn’t know where I was, stumbling over sticks and roots, until I spotted it. A tiny pile of rocks. I booked it for the tunnel, as fast as I've ever run. I could hear it again. It hadn't given up. I had just guaranteed a more painful death if it caught me. I dove for the hole, scrambling through it and into the tunnel. It was dark, I didn’t have my flashlight anymore. I must've dropped it when the beast caught me. I heard it crawl into the tunnel, the ground rumbling as it tore through dirt to catch me. I reached the door, slamming into it and searching for the handle in the dark. I finally found it as the monster came into view. I threw the door open and jumped through, pulling the door closed behind me. It slammed into the door. 

CRUNCH!!!

It broke something, as a wet, crunching sound echoed in my head. The scraping, thudding noises against the door were deafening, violent, sickening. A dark blood seeped from under the door, staining the carpet in crimson. It wouldn't stop.

I left my house immediately and went to a friend's house, making up a stupid excuse.

A few days later I went home to find that the door was gone. My parents returned home a day later and I never mentioned it. They didn't seem to notice the stain.

I've never seen the door since. It's been two or three years but I've never seen it since. I thought writing this out here might help me work through it. I try my best to forget what I saw.

But I always remember.

DON'T OPEN THE DOOR
