I didn't believe it at first, but sleeping in a tent in the middle of summer can be freezing. Heat waves be damned, I wasn't expecting to be shivering in my tent to the point I was worried I'd die from the cold. I packed to what I thought was the proper standard when I agreed to join my friend and colleague Stephen for a camping trip. 

He was a family man, and also a faithful man. Him and his wife Anna had a great marriage and had three children. He had a group of friends, primarily from church, that were almost like a second family to him. This group was the group that would be joining us. 

For the most part, they were pretty awesome. Almost all of them were nearly a decade on me in age, including Stephen himself. I welcomed it. I was always happy to indulge the wisdom of the older folks, but not old enough that they'd lose touch with reality. Besides the couple there was Danny, Chad, Trent, and Trent's girlfriend Melanie. Fortunately, Stephen's kids were with his parents for the weekend. 

Generously, Stephen even provided me with a tent, after mine had broken while it was being cramped into the back of his van. The new tent fitted ten people, whereas my now broken tent fitted four. It was a massive upgrade! There was a catch though; I'd be sharing the tent with Stephen's brother-in-law named Russel. 

Russel didn't show up on the first night, so I had the massive tent all to myself. As I said before,  I was frozen. I managed to nod off in the early hours of the morning, listening to the inconsistent rallying cries of the coyotes in the area. 

Even though they were technically family, Stephen and Anna didn't seem excited that Russel would be joining. I'd never met the guy, nor did I hear much about him from previous hangouts with Stephen and periodically, Anna too. Russel was a...more troubled individual than his sister. He cared more for all sorts of vices rather than the values Anna and Stephen had. 

The differences between Russel and the rest of the group became apparent when he pulled up to the campsite. His truck had all the stereotypical douchey modifications on it. He pulled a skid and attempted a burnout in front of the site, before haphazardly parking his truck and hopping out of the truck. 

He dwarfed most of us, he was nearly seven feet tall. He was tall and surprisingly bulky, and had a well groomed goatee with the slightest touches of grey in it. He stamped his cigarette on the dirt road and wasted no time unloading a surprisingly little amount of camping gear. He gave us a few awkward nods and began unloading his stuff In the tent. Our tent. 

"Russel, right?" I entered the tent with my hand out. "Nice to meet you."

He looked at my hand, grinned and gripped it tight. "You're Kyle, yeah? This tent is the shit aint it?" 

I blinked. I was half expecting him to be a lot more hostile. I smiled. "Yeah, Stephen's pretty generous to let me share with you."

"His only good quality, I'd say," Russel replied. "But my sister is happy with him, so its all good."

There was clearly more history I didn't really care to delve into at the current moment. I poked my head outside the tent to see the rest of the camping crew ushering themselves towards the campfire. Our tent was the farthest away from it. I got weird, tense feeling in my gut. Were they going to avoid him the whole time? What was the point of him even coming along?

"Got a lot of good shit that these goodie-two-shoes won't go near," I heard Russel say as he passed me on the way out of the tent and back to his truck. "I could use some help unloading."

I nodded and walked with him to his truck. What he really needed a hand with was unloading a copious amount of alcohol. He had enough booze to get the whole camping squad blacked out several times over. 

"Jesus!" I spat, as I reached for a box of hard iced-tea. 

"Don't be saying the lord's name in vain too loudly," Russel chuckled. 

After I helped Russel unload the booze he insisted on having a nap, so I checked up on the other group. None of them, not even Anna went to greet Russel this whole time. I thought it was strange, I wasn't expecting this level of exclusion and potential drama for people well in their mid-thirties. At the fear of being ostracized I didn't ask, horrible as that sounded. 

About an hour or two later I went to grab something from the tent, where I saw Russel was awake, about to light up a joint. 

"Hey Kyle, want some?" he offered me the first hit. I declined.

"I prefer to drink," I said, gesturing to a can of Twisted Tea that was unopened in my hand. 

I sat with him and we ended up shooting the shit for a while. He seemed like a pleasant guy, so I had to ask:

"Nobody came to say hi to you, and you haven't left the tent...no offence but why are you here?" I asked, immediately regretting my forwardness. 

Russel sighed.

"We believe in different things. I'm out here because it's my calling. They don't agree with it, and I don't agree with their beliefs either. One thing they agree upon is expression of faith. There's something important to mine here. We live in a world of freedom of choices."

"So believe as in...?" I asked. Russel pointed one finger to the sky, and one to the ground. I took a drunken second to process it. 

"By the way, do you fall asleep fast?" Russel asked me. 

"Normally, but not with this cold, why?"

"Try to tonight," he answered, I could feel a sincerity in his words but also something...dark. 

We talked for a little while longer then I joined up with the others. We played some board games with a few lanterns adorning the tables. We looked at the stars, and told stories around the fire. Eventually the night was winding down to an end. 

I tucked myself into the cozy cot that I brought, and realized it was much warmer tonight. That comfort let me fall asleep fast. 

Until something woke me up. 

It sounded like chittering. It wasn't a normal human noise. I was rolled over on my left side, and the noise was coming from the other side of the tent, where Russel was. Nothing but the tent wall faced me. It took me a second to realize it.

The chittering noises were from Russel himself. With making an effort to make as little noise as possible, I turned my head over to just barely make him out. 

He was sitting, and twitching his body unnaturally. The chittering words almost sounded as if someone was talking backwards. They seemed like words, but not of any language a normal person would speak. I stared at him for about five minutes. He carried on with his unnerving speech until I rolled back over. I didn't want to yell and wake him up. I don't think I was supposed to see this. 

"And he calls upon me the next witching hour, to the salvation below," I heard him mutter in clear English. He sounded exhausted, letting out a weak sob before laying back into his air mattress. I checked my phone. It was 3:11am. Despite the weirdness, I managed to fall asleep fast. 

The next morning Russel had left the tent. I noticed he'd left a black candlestick by his pillow as well as some ominous drawings of symbols in the woods. The candlestick hadn't been lit up yet. I poked my head out of the tent to see his truck was gone, too. 

I asked the ones who were awake by the fire, including Stephen where Russel went off to. They replied he was going to be in a nearby town for most of the day. I brought up the weirdness of last night, and I think the group lied to me. Telling me it was a side-effect of his medication, or withdrawals from it. Not wanting to dig deeper, I left it alone.

The second day was spent at the nearby river, and playing a lot of beach volleyball. I ended up getting pretty sunburnt, but that was alright. Russel ended up coming back to the camp around 8:00pm and quickly dove for his tent. Strange. I decided I'd leave him be. 

The night activities for the rest of us were relatively the same. Although this time we ended up staying out much later than before. I checked my phone, which was fairly low on battery. It was 2:47am. Figured I'd need to get to bed, and called it a night. 

I approached the tent with caution. Didn't want to come in on any creepy shit from Russel. I put an ear to the tent as my heart started to race. I heard something quietly come from the tent: snoring. I was in the clear for now. 

I had a hard time falling asleep. Lots of tossing and turning for at least twenty minutes. I was just about to fall asleep when I heard it again

The inhuman noises. The awful, backwards speech. I could hear Russel's body flailing and thrashing this time and I did my best to stay perfectly still, facing away from him. It was difficult to do, as this time they sounded louder and more aggressive. 

Louder, and louder, until I noticed something. The noises were closer. 

He was right at the back of my head, speaking what I can only imagine was demonic. If this was just a side effect of his meds or lack thereof, then I could snap him out of this trance, right? I could smell sulphur from what I assumed was his mouth near the back of my neck. I sprung into action.

"Russel, what are you-!" 

I interrupted myself with a loud yelp and gasp. Russel was indeed right behind me. He was burning the black candlestick, looking at me. His eyes were leaking a black liquid, and his mouth looked far too stretched at the corners to be normal. His face was getting closer to mine, the light of the candle accenting his features. 

I kicked my backpack at his leg, and the noises stopped. He started giggling. 

"You really would make a good believer," he said to me. "We needn't piss about with the worms on the surface." 

Black ooze from his eyes splattered on the floor as he blinked. He turned his attention towards the tent's entrance. He locked eyes with me.

"To the salvation, Kyle."

He left the tent. I could hear him sprint at an incredibly fast pace that made me feel even more unsettled into the woods. 

I didn't really sleep well for the rest of the night. I didn't hear any abnormal noises aside from the rallying coyotes every now and then. 

A part of me wanted to wake Stephen and Anna, but another part of me wanted to believe this was a night terror that I struggled to wake myself from. I tossed and turned on my thoughts until somehow I ended up dozing off. 

The first thing I did in the morning was show the group the drawings I found in Russel's tent. A good section of the group immediately started praying for protection. Eventually, Stephen reluctantly called 911 to report a missing person. 

It took a decent amount of time for authorities to show up, and the group filled them in about his personal information and whatnot. They interviewed me, as I was sharing a tent with him. When asked about his motives for leaving, all I could really tell them was that he was working on his faith. I showed them the drawings as well as the now black mold on the tent floor.
