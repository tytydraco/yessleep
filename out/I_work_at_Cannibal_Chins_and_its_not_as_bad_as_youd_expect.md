I'm only posting this to disprove some of the accusations made by the powers that be against me, the owner, and one of my co-workers.   
  
First, Adrian Nelson is a liar. If you ever happen to be in the northeastern side of New Jersey and happen to run into a long haired guy with a lumberjack-esque beard who looks like he's seen a ghost, don't believe a word he says. I know for a fact that Adrian did not, in fact, survive the, let's say, "incident" on March 3rd. His spirit or whatever is eternally bound to the restaurant (just a thing that happens when you die within the property line). If you find "Adrian" anywhere outside of the restaurant's parking lot, ignore him. It's better for your mental health.  
  
Second, the owner does not spend all his time mutilating himself to make our products. Is it true that he may have accidentally cut off his finger while teaching the Cook how to, ya know, cook? Yes. Did that severed finger fall into one of the greasers along with the fries? Also yes. Did a customer eat that finger? Yes. What followed afterward was a long series of lawsuits, the restaurant being shut down for a few months, and the owner eventually rebranding to "Cannibal Chin's" to capitalize on his own grisly story. But since that first accident, the owner does not use any of his body parts to feed the patrons. At least I don't think he does.  
  
Come to think about it, I've never actually seen a delivery truck come to the restaurant. Whatever, that's above my paygrade anyway.  
  
Also no one of or relating to Cannibal Chin's discriminates against the undead. A few of New Jersey's local "witches" decided to hold a Ouiji board sermon or something in the restaurant one day. They claimed that the restaurant's proximity to the meadowlands was actually great for thinning the veil between this mortal coil and the world beyond. A few dozen cups of water and two baskets of free breadsticks later, the red haired, tatted up, wide eyed wiccan got up from her table and approached me at the counter.  
  
"Hi," I said, trying my best to maintain my composure for these people that surely wouldn't even tip, "Would you like to order something?"  
  
The red haired wiccan, who I had taken to calling Red, moved her hair out of her eyes and cleared her throat, "My coven and I would like to file a formal complaint against your service, ma'am."  
  
"What?" I said.   
  
I must have looked more shocked than I was actually feeling, because I saw the most shit eating grin creep across Red's face as she said, "Your soul is tainted."  
  
I raised my eyebrow, faked a concerned frown, and waited for her to continue. I've found it easier to placate most of the customers rather than ignore them or be rude. Things tend to go more smoothly that way, at least in my experience.   
  
"You've become corrupt by capitalism, bureaucracy, and greed. It's made you apathetic. You're so far from reaching the light of Satan right now that you might as well be in Purgatory. You know nothing, and are nothing. Just an inky black void floating around, waiting for something to come along and put you out of your misery."  
  
Well, if she wanted to insult me, she wasn't doing a great job. She was annoying me, mostly, kind of like all those psychiatrists the company made me see after my first six months working here.   
  
"There is a way you can help yourself though," She told me, holding her hand outstretched to me. Whether she wanted me to take it or not was anyone's guess, but I damn sure wasn't making any physical contact with her if I could avoid it.  
  
Instead though, one of the other witches handed Red a small, rusted key with a five pointed star welded onto the end of it. I didn't even see this one get up from the booth. They were silent, like a fart in the wind.   
  
This one was androgynous looking, with long black hair kept in dreadlocks, snakebite piercings, and a tattoo under their right eye. I guess it was supposed to be some kind of archaic, runic, otherworldly sigil, but to me it just looked like a toddler tried to draw a key on their face.  
  
The second "witch", who I'm calling Key, stared at me after they handed the key to Red. They had bulging, beady green eyes that honestly seemed like they were going to fall out of their head. They didn't blink, their gaze never wandered.   
  
Now that, was unnerving.   
  
Red handed me the key (with Key still silently watching me. I was starting to feel like a rabbit in front of a lion), and winked. She turned around, taking Key in their arm, and walked toward the door. The third "witch" got up from the booth to follow them, never saying a word or looking at me at all. Thank god for small miracles.  
  
Before Red crossed the threshold separating the inside from the outside, she yelled back over her shoulder, "You'll thank me later!", and let the door close after her.   
  
When they were gone, I went to bus their table but I was surprised to find that their table was actually clean. Like, more than clean. More than spotless, even. It was practically brand new. The years of stains and dried up half-fake, half-maybe real blood, splinters, dust, it was all gone. The seats were refurbished and crisp, like they'd been taken from the set of a 1950's malt shop, which was strange because the seats were rentals from the previous owners of this building.  
  
I knew that for a fact because I helped move them in here. This level of cleanliness should have been impossible for anyone to do, let alone while sitting at a table right in front of me and playing with a Ouija board. I'm not complaining in the slightest, it's just very unusual.   
  
On top of all of that tho, they left a pretty decent tip, despite not ordering anything. It's not often there are, well, "nice" things that happen in the restaurant.   
  
Circling back to Adrian Nelson, my good for nothing coworker whose presence in this story is, regrettably, too large. A few weeks after the "witches" left the restaurant, the owner came out of the back, walked to the entrance, hung up our "Closed" sign, and locked the door.  
  
He looked a lot worse for wear than the last time I saw him; his eyes were bloodshot, his fingernails were gnarled and gangly, like they'd been untrimmed for at least several months. His beard was a shade of grey that was almost unnatural for someone his age. His apron was stained with way more blood than normal. I doubt all of that was his. The coloring was off.  
  
The owner grabbed my shoulders, whispering frantically to me, "Marceline, I need you to go into the basement RIGHT NOW. There's something down there and it's got Andrian and the Cook held hostage."  
  
"What uh," I stuttered, "What the fuck is down there?"  
  
"I have no idea, but it's not friendly."  
  
"Well what do you expect me to do!" I asked him.   
  
He shrugged, "Use your feminine charm or something, I don't know. The restaurant will close if I go down there and die, and we can't replace the Cook because of- we can't replace him. Look, in all honesty I just need you to save the Cook. If you can snag Adrian too, great! If not, oh well!"  
  
"And what if I...?"  
  
"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it."  
  
NEXT TIME: I deal with the basement. See you then (assuming I survive).  
  
Marceline, signing off.
