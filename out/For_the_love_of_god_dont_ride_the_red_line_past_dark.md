If you were to poll any daily commuter, they’d tell you the trains operated by the Chicago Transit Authority are far from elegant. The floor is sticky, the cabins smell like piss, and the odds you’ll see someone urinating and defecating directly onto the platform rises exponentially after dark. Despite all this, however, I can’t help but love it. I was a teenager visiting from the suburbs when I first boarded the brown line. It provided me a freedom of mobility I had never experienced before. If you can look past the sorry state of most of the trains, a ride on the train can be captivating. That’s why I’m so heartbroken I can never ride again.

Don’t get it twisted, I wasn’t banned or anything, I just can’t trust it anymore. Not after what I’ve been through. It was a couple weeks back, and I was taking the red line south from my job in the Loop. Anybody within a 50-mile radius of the city can tell you the red line is bad news, especially after dark, but it’s manageable if you know what you’re doing. Keep one earbud out, keep your head down, and for the love of god, never look at people walking between the cars. If you were to run a census among people who have used the emergency doors on the Chicago subway, not a single one of them has a clean record.

I like to think of myself as a person that doesn’t often pass judgement, but the sorry state of these inter-car wanderers is really something to behold. Their clothes are more grime than fabric, tattered and worn. They reek of weeks of caked on piss and shit, and their eyes are glazed over, like the dead walking. If not for their ability to operate a door, you would be forgiven for assuming they had lost all mental faculty. These are a special breed of human. I’ve had them mumble at me as I pretend not to hear, lunge at me to gauge if I’m jumpy, and pull their pants down and shit while I’m in the seat next to them.

You’ve gotta understand then that it wasn’t too out of the ordinary when I saw the man that day. On the way down, a balding man with a grimy beard and a shitstained surgical mask pulled beneath his nose passed from the doors in the back and made his way up the car and to the next car up. The train came to a stop between Sox-35^(th) and 47^(th). The loudspeaker mumbled its typical incoherent fuzz that somewhat resembled an announcement of maintenance, and a promise to begin moving again shortly. Now at this moment I took stock of who was in the car. We might be together for a bit, and no suspicion is unreasonable on the red line. Everyone seemed, more or less, to be like me. Normal people on their way home after work or school.

There was one man sleeping on the seats, resting his head on a backpack with a blanket draped over him. These sleepers are actually the least of your worries on the train. When you don’t have a home, a $2.50 moving hotel room doesn’t seem like too bad a deal. If you get up and change trains every two hours, you have a place to sleep  where people can’t find you. I let my head back down and scrolled my phone for another 15 minutes before I got irritated at the stoppage. There had to be at least one other train right behind us waiting to move forward. What’s taking them so long?

I tried to chill out and go back to my phone when I felt the cabin start to shake around a bit. I thought this meant we were moving again, but when I looked out the window, we were standing still. Inside our car, the passengers looked at each other in confusion when suddenly, the connecting door opened, and the balding walked through. I didn’t notice it was him because again, you have to pretend these people aren’t there if you don’t want to be harassed. I was alerted when a woman in her forties stood up and shrieked. I shot my head over there and saw his ragged garb was dripped in blood. His mask was fully saturated and dripping, but his hoodie and jacket was only speckled in it.

I would later lament that my train just happened to be the one to get hit with a bath salt zombie, but in the moment my mind was blank, and I froze. He grabbed the woman and pulled his mask down, revealing his rotted and wide spaced teeth. She broke away from him before he could bite, but he continued his pursuit, mumbling nonsense that resembled English in phonetics alone. The whole car stood up and went for the door on the opposite side, but it wouldn’t open when they tried. Everyone crowded in the back as he staggered forward. Just before he lunged, however, the man sleeping on the seats shot up and jabbed him in the neck with a short pocketknife.

He must’ve hit an artery because the blood poured out of him like a faucet, blood spattering against the floor. The cops arrived only minutes later. All in all, he took out the train operator, mutilated a man in the next car down, and ignored the passengers in two consecutive cars. In his blood they found meth, MDMA, shrooms, and fentanyl. Just a schizo who drove himself over the edge. Even though weeks have passed, I haven’t been able to get myself to take the train. I’ve killed myself on Uber fare while I figure out where and how to get a car. It sucks, but I just can’t do it anymore. That’s a problem for the sleepers to handle, I guess.
