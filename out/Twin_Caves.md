Pt 1- “Captivation”

I was outside smoking a cigarette on my lunch break when my phone rings- it’s my older sister, Chelsie. She doesn’t usually call me, so I’m surprised as well as a bit worried when I answer. 

“Hello?” The way my voice sounds like I’m talking to a stranger makes me feel a twinge of guilt. I tend to keep a distance from my family these days, so I haven’t seen my sister in person in over a year. The last time we even exchanged text messages was months ago. 

“Charlie…” Her voice cracks as she speaks and it sounds like she’s holding back tears. Something bad must have happened. My heart sinks in my chest when she says, “Gramma and Grampa died.” 

She starts sobbing through the phone. My heart sunk in my chest and tears welled up in my eyes. I loved my grandparents dearly, they practically raised us. They were great people, always bringing us along to do something fun together and comforting us the best they could when life got rough. I realized it had been a while since I last gave them a call, and my guilt deepened. 

“What… what happened?” I choked out the words with tears running down my face. 

“There was a bad fire… they didn’t make it. The whole house burnt down while they were asleep.” 

“Oh my God…” 

After a long pause, Chelsea says “The funeral is in two weeks.” She takes a deep breath and lets out a long sigh. “I was hoping we could drive down together.”

“Yeah… yeah, course.” 

I was utterly devastated, but I thought it would be good to spend some quality time with my sister. We talked a bit more, reminiscing about memories of the good times we spent with our grandparents and catching up on life. After I hung up I wiped my tears, got myself together and finished out my work day. I thought about my sister and how we used to spend our childhood days exploring the wilderness around our little hometown and all the joy it had brought me. I made myself a promise that after the funeral we would stay in touch as much as possible and make more great memories together. 

Over the next few days Chelsie and I exchanged a lot of calls and text messages, planning our trip and comforting each other. We decided she would meet me at my apartment and we would take turns driving my car over the two day trip, then spend a few days in our hometown after the funeral going to all of our old hang out spots and hiking trails and reliving the good old days. We could have just flown, but we both agreed that a road trip would be a much better adventure. 

When my sister arrived at my door the day we were set to leave, I realized that she was now the only family I had left. Our dad drank himself to death years ago. He was an angry drunk who made our lives hell sometimes, especially after our mom left. She just took off one night while everyone was asleep, without even so much as a goodbye or a note left behind. Our dad didn’t even bother reporting her missing. It wasn’t until my sister and I told our grandparents we hadn’t seen our mother in three days that they called the town sheriff and a search party was started. 

They never found any trace of her or evidence of foul play, so the sheriff told us that she probably just ran away to start a new life but that he would let us know if there were any new developments. There never were, and we never saw her again. 

My sister and I grew up as what you might call tomboys. We didn’t like wearing dresses or playing with dolls, and we preferred to spend most of our time after school playing outside and getting dirty. My name is Charlotte but I started making people call me Charlie in elementary school because Charlotte was too “girly”. Chelsea and I were really close, and very similar in a lot of ways. We even looked alike. People around town would say that we were practically twins. 

After high school my sister moved to Washington to go to college and I followed. I couldn’t handle the stress of trying to get an education so I ended up dropping out and moving across the state with my boyfriend at the time. I drifted apart from my sister, called my grandparents less and less, and didn’t make many friends in my new town. I’ve been single and living alone the past few years, and my dog Sadie is pretty much my only friend now. My fear of abandonment has kept me from getting too close to anyone. But now that my sister was all I had left, I was determined to keep up with our relationship no matter what. 

The drive down was a ton of fun. We ate at gas stations and slept in the car to save money. We took a few detours to go sight seeing. We talked and laughed and sang together as we rekindled our sisterhood. Somewhere around South Dakota, we stopped to finally eat a real meal at a little diner somewhere. Chelsea showed me an article she had found on her phone about a new cave system that had just been discovered in our home town and we decided we would go see it while we were there. 

“Check it out, Charlie.” She said, giddy like a child. “It’s called Twin Caves… it’s like it was made for us!” 

The image was really something. It looked like a top down view of the entrance, which was at the bottom of a massive pit that ended in a flat stone floor, with two caves branching off on one side. It looked like nothing I’d ever seen before. 

“They had a team of scientists down there a few weeks ago. They say no one knows how it formed this way. Isn’t that amazing?”

“Chels…” I stared at the image on the phone screen in awe, but another vague feeling was building inside me. Something about it seemed… unreal, unbelievable. It looked otherworldly, like something that didn’t belong here. “Don’t you think it’s weird how much of these woods we explored and never found? It looks huge.”

“Oh come on, we were just kids then. We just thought we explored every inch of those woods because we didn’t know how big it was.”

“But what about other people? All the hunters, hikers, campers? And none of them ever found this until now? I just think this it’s weird, that’s all.”

“Well the cave is on private property. So they probably just didn’t wanna trespass or something.” She shrugged indifferently and continued eating her burger. 

I was surprised by her enthusiasm for entering the cave, as she was always a bit more timid about our adventures than I was. Chelsea was the shy one who was always too afraid to stick up for herself or get in trouble. She always got uneasy when I wanted to hike too deep into the woods or swim too far out into a lake. She started bringing up Twin Caves more and more, and by the time we got to our destination it was practically all she talked about. It was a bit strange, but I pushed my apprehension to the side. I just wanted to make my sister happy and make up for the time we lost. 

Pt 2 “Congregation”

 A somber feeling washed over the both of us as we passed the faded old wooden sign that said “Jerry, Alabama”. We had made it back home. 

Chelsea had discovered that the private property the cave entrance was on had turned an old farmhouse into a bed and breakfast, so that’s where we’d be staying while we were there. It was only a few miles from the house we grew up in. As we pulled my little car into the driveway the owners were already walking out from the farmhouse to greet us. 

“Did you call ahead and book a room?” I asked.

“No.” 

“Huh…” 

An elderly man and women approached them. The woman was smiling and looked friendly, almost excited to see us. The man had a stony, expressionless face. 

“Welcome!” The woman exclaimed, opening her arms and pulling me into a hug. It was awkward, but I didn’t want to be rude. “Welcome to Twin Caves Bed and Breakfast! I’m Lillith Blackwood, this is my husband, Sam Blackwood.” Sam nodded. “Will you be booking a room for the night?” Lillith continued.

“Actually we were hoping to stay the next three days or so if that’s not a problem.” Chelsea said.

“Well in that case we are so glad to have you! Allow me to show you your room.” 

They showed us around the house and to our room, which looked quaint in an ancient way. It was a tiny room with old wooden furniture, handmade quilts on both of the two beds, and doilies on the nightstands and the one dresser. Our hosts departed the room and we started unpacking our bags. There was a little statue of Jesus on a cross hanging next to the window. 

“It’s upside down.” Chelsea said. “It must have fell.” She put down the backpack she was emptying and walked over to the window to straighten the cross. “There ya go.” 

The next morning was our grandparents' funeral. Their church had organized the whole thing, so my sister and I didn’t have to worry about anything but showing up. A lot of people came to pay their respects, and I wasn’t surprised. Jerry was a small town and pretty much everyone went to church, and my grandparents were active members of the Angel of Jerry Catholic Church. They rarely ever missed a Sunday service, and my Gramma always made something delicious for potluck events. Chelsea and I used to go with them to church and we both attended years of Sunday school there. I never wanted to go, and usually had to be bribed or threatened with a grounding. I never went to another Sunday service as soon as my sister and I moved to Washington. Chelsea loved Sunday school and her faith stayed strong in her adulthood. She even went to church most weeks all through college from what I remember. 

After the service there was a potluck lunch which most of the guests attended. In the packed basement of the church, we chatted with old friends and acquaintances as we ate honey ham, mac and cheese, funeral potatoes and cookies. 

“Charlotte! It’s so good to see you!”

It was our old Sunday school teacher, Clara Johnson. The kids always called her Miss Clara, and she was like everyone’s second mom. I used to be friends with her grandson, Tommy, in elementary school, so I asked how he was doing. 

“Oh…” Clara looked down with a frown when I asked about Tommy. “He hasn’t been doin’ so well, I’m afraid. I’m not sure if y’all heard about the missing children? Well… my great grandson was one of ‘em. Tommy’s boy, Zachary.” 

“I am so sorry to hear that, Miss Clara.”

“Some of the church volunteers took the elementary Sunday school class on a camping trip out in the woods…” Her brow furrowed. She looked so sad. “All nine of them have been missing for weeks.” 

I gave Miss Clara a comforting squeeze on her hand. “I’m sorry.” I repeated. I didn’t know what to say. 

“They haven’t found a trace of them still… but I know they will. This is a God fearin’ town, and just about everyone has joined the search party. I just know they’ll bring my grandbaby back to me.”

She looked hopeful now, and I didn’t want to spoil that for her, so I said, “I’m sure they will, Miss Clara.” 

We spent half the day at the funeral, and when we got back to the bed and breakfast we were both sad and tired. We spent most of the day laying in bed. Chelsea read her Bible while I played games on my phone. There was hardly any cell service out here and I was intensely bored. Around 6pm Lilith knocked at our door to announce she had made dinner for everyone and we followed her downstairs to the dining room. 

They served us the worst dinner I’d ever eaten in my life. I couldn’t discern what most of the ingredients were, but it had chunks of tough meat that tasted like pork and a side of hard stale bread. During the meal, a tall man in dirty overalls with a long scraggly beard walked into the kitchen quietly. He had a bandage wrapped around his entire left hand and left side of his face that covered one eye. He didn’t speak or look at anyone as he entered, keeping his head down as he prepared a bowl of the mystery stew and sulked away. 

“That’s our son, Jude.” Lillith explained. “He’s a shy boy.”

I didn’t sleep well that night. I had a nightmare that I awoke somewhere cold and dark, laying on a hard stone floor. I couldn’t remember where I was or how I had got there. I got up and tried to find my way out by running my hands along the walls, but all around me was nothing but stone. I was trapped. I screamed. 

I jolted awake from the nightmare, sitting up fast in my bed. My body was drenched in sweat like I had a fever, but it was freezing. I heard a sudden scraping sound coming from the window that made my heart race. I snapped my head in the direction of the noise, and I thought I saw a giant hand with long skinny fingers in the darkness on the other side. I shook my head, and looked again. It was just the branches of a tree. 

The next day we went hiking. Sticks Creek ran right alongside the property line. It was one of our favorite spots to play as kids. In some spots it was deep enough to swim in. All the kids around town called it Sticks Creek because we would all try to be the first to dam up the creek with piles of sticks, but no one ever managed to accomplish the feat. Chelsea and I grabbed some granola bars, threw on our boots and set off for our first adventure back home. 

We walked along the creek for a while, discussing our childhood and gathering a nice little collection of cool looking rocks. 

I crouched down to pick up a branch that looked like it would be a good walking stick. 

“Remember when Mom used to tell us it was bad luck to hike without a walking stick?” I reminisced. 

“Yeah…” Chelsea replied thoughtfully as she gazed into the gently flowing water. It was always a comforting sound. “Do you think she’s still alive?”

“I don’t know… I don’t know why she wouldn’t be. Why would you think that?” 

“I don’t know, it’s just…” She pondered for a moment. “When she left, it felt like she just… stopped existing.” 

“I guess that’s just how grief feels.” She looked sad, and I knew my answer didn’t comfort her. We kept walking. 

A little while later we took off our boots and socks and crossed the creek to go deeper into the woods. We hiked a good ways into the trees before deciding to head back. We had been out for a while and the granola bars were no longer fiending off our hunger. I crossed the creek first, boots in hand with my socks tucked inside them. I turned around at the shore and pulled out my phone to snap a picture of Chelsea, who was knee deep in the middle of it. She stopped and smiled, holding up a peace sign. 

We made it back to the bed and breakfast some time after noon, showered and put on some clean clothes, then took the car into town to get a bite at Jerry’s Diner. I pulled out my phone to look at the pictures I took from our hike as we ate. I captured some beautiful trees, a squirrel, birds, and a few selfies of us together. The one of Chelsea in Sticks Creek was the last picture in my camera roll. As I looked, I noticed something strange in the background. About ten feet down the creek behind my sister, there was something in the water. It looked like a row of jagged black ridges. I turned my phone to show her.

“What the Hell is that?” 

“What?” Chelsea said, squinting at the screen. “I don’t see anything.” 

I zoomed in on the anomaly and showed her again. “That.” I said. “It almost looks like… a crocodile or something.” 

Chelsea laughed. “A crocodile, Charlie? There’s no crocodiles in Alabama. It’s probably just a fish or some weird algae or something.”

“There’s gators though, right?” 

“I don’t recall anyone ever seeing a gator in sticks creek. And I don’t think they come in black.” We both laughed. 

It was now day three of our trip, and I knew I couldn’t put off Twin Caves any longer. We ate a terrible breakfast courtesy of the Blackwoods, who were just as creepy as always. Seconds after stepping out the back door, the ugliest damn dog I ever seen in my life came charging and snarling at me, sending me reeling backwards. I landed hard on my ass. The awful creature resembled the shape of a dog, but it was hairless with blood red skin and patches of rough black flesh that almost charred. 

“Sentinel!” Suddenly Sam appeared out of nowhere and grabbed the thing by its thick black leather collar. 

“What in the fuck is that?!” I screamed. 

“He’s a good dog.” He said. “Just got a skin condition. It’s a genetic thing. Won’t hurt ya. He’s just a bit loud.”

Chelsea and I exchanged incredulous glances at each other as he led the demonic looking dog back toward the house. 

The cave wasn’t too far from their house. I truly couldn’t fathom how it went unnoticed for so long when it was practically in someone’s backyard. Someone had constructed a huge round slab of concrete with rebar handles as a makeshift lid. It took all of our combined strength to drag it to the side. Then we set up our repelling gear and made our way down the stone shaft. There was still sunlight creeping down at us at the bottom. 

“Which way should we go?” I asked, gesturing at the two nearly identical corridors in front of us. 

“Wow…” Chelsea stared into the darkness of the entrances, transfixed. Our voices echoed quietly around us. “It’s so beautiful.” 

“It’s creepy as fuck.” I remarked. 

She started off into the left hand entrance and I followed behind. The entrance was wide and tall, plenty of room for us to walk side by side. Not too far in the light began to fade into darkness, so we switched on our flashlights. We didn’t speak much through our awe, just the occasional whisper of “whoa” or “cool” as we drug the beams of light over the walls and floors and ceiling of the cave, marveling at this new wonder of the natural world. There were a few places where the cave branched off, but it seemed an easy enough path to backtrack so we didn’t worry about it. 

It started to get cold. I stopped and shivered, questioning my choice of a light hoodie instead of a jacket. That’s when I heard an eerier whooshing sound rush through the darkness. 

“Chels… do you hear that?” 

“Hear what?” 

“It sounds like… wind?” 

She paused and listened. “Yeah I do… How’d that get in here?” She giggled and I smiled, trying to pretend it wasn’t unnerving. We continued. 

It seemed like only a few minutes had passed when suddenly I realized I couldn’t hear my sisters footsteps anymore. I turned around, swinging my flashlight everywhere. She was gone. 

“Chels??” I called, panic in my voice. How long ago had gotten separated? How far had I gone without her? I tried to recollect when we parted ways, but for some reason my memory seemed foggy. I wasn’t even sure how long I’d been down here. I pointed my flashlight at the mechanical watch on my wrist. It read 1:13. I tried to remember what time we entered the cave, but I couldn’t. I knew was in the morning, we set off not long after waking up. There was no way we’d been down here for hours already. 

A cold chill froze me when I heard the hellish sound washing through the cavern again. It was louder this time, and almost sounded like screaming. 

“Fuck.” I whispered and started speed walking back the way I (hoped) I came.

 My panic rose. I wanted to scream for my sister, but the words just wouldn’t come. I was so afraid. Even the sound of my own footsteps was frightening. I started to feel like I was being watched… like I was being followed. I picked up my pace. I tried to deduce where I was at in the cave, but everything looked the same. Finally, a light I could see light peeking through the entrance in front me. I ran toward, and broke into the bottom of the pit panting. I looked around, but there was still no sign of my sister. 

“Chelsea!” I screamed up toward the surface. No response. “CHELSEEEEEE!” I hollered as loud as my lungs could go. 

“Charlie!” Her voice echoed into the pit. It was coming from the other entrance. Why would she leave me and go all the way back, just to go into the other cave alone? I wondered. I ran down the dark corridor, trying to steady the beam of my flashlight ahead. 

I came to a fork. I shined my flashlight down both ways, but didn’t see her. 

“Chels!” I called into the darkness. 

“Charlie! I’m here!” 

I followed her voice. When I finally caught up to her, she looked pale and scared. 

“Chelsea what the Hell!” I shouted. I was angry that she left me. “Why did you take off like that? You just left me!”

“I… I don’t know!” She started crying. “I don’t remember.”

“We need to get back, it’s been hours.” 

“What?” She looked confused. “Hours?? It’s only been a few minutes.”

I showed her my watch. It read 1:48 now. She looked horrified. 

“Jesus Christ what happened…” She whispered, her voice trembling with fear. 

“I don’t know but we need to leave!”

“Hold on…” She said, unshouldering her backpack and digging out a rappelling rope. She began attaching us by the belt loops with the rope and carabiners. “I don’t wanna get separated again.”

I stood waiting, soaked with fear, my heart pounding. The feeling of being watched came over me again. It felt like the cave itself was somehow filled with… anger. I tried to tell myself I was just being paranoid. I kept my flashlight pointed at my sister's hands so she could see what she was doing. 

Everyone has a moment in their life that changes them forever. An eternity experienced in one single second that can either define or destroy your faith in reality. A moment that haunts you forever.

This was that moment for me. 

The noise echoed out from the darkness behind my sister, from deeper within the cave. 

Click… click click

We both froze. My hand shook as I reluctantly raised my flashlight into the darkness. It illuminated a bend in the structure. From the other side reached a huge boney hand with long bloodred fingers and jagged black pointed tips. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even breathe. Another hand reached out slowly and gripped the edge of the wall. I heard its charred talons click against the stone. 

A gust of hot, loud wind blew from its direction, carrying the stench of hate. It sounded like thousands of screaming voices. 

We ran. The dim sunlight at the other end of the passage felt like an eternity away. I didn’t dare look over my shoulder. We attached ourselves hurriedly to the rappelling gear and made the fastest climb I’ve ever done in my life. When we finally reached the top we unhooked our ropes and without a word each grabbed a handle on the massive concrete cover. 

But, somehow, it didn’t fit. It was like the hole had gotten a little bit bigger. We heaved it back onto the grass and looked at eachother, completely bewildered and out of breath. We started to gather our gear into our backpacks quickly and leave the area, when we turned and saw a group of people approaching. It was the Blackwoods, escorting Miss Clara and her husband Bob. 

“Hey there, girls!” Clara shouted cheerfully. “We heard about this new cave and we just had to come take a look at one of God’s miracles!”

“Clara, you can’t!” I shouted. “It’s not safe!”

I wanted to explain what we saw, but I knew they wouldn't believe me. I begged them not to go in, but they insisted. 

“Don’t be silly.” Lillith interrupted with an eerily wide smile. “It’s perfectly safe.” 

Clara and Bob began setting up a rappelling rope at the edge of the pit. I grabbed Chelsea’s arm and pulled her toward the house. 

When we were out of earshot, I said, “We need to go get the Sheriff.”

“Let’s go.” Chelsea said. 

We ran straight to the car. I nearly ran over the Blackwoods mailbox on my way out. As we were speeding toward town, it started to rain hard and fast. I turned my windshield wipers on full blast, but it poured so heavily it hardly made a difference. I had to slow down. The road was barely visible, and already covered with water. A section of Sticks Creek ran right alongside the road, and the water level was rapidly rising. 

Suddenly the rain started the take on a pinkish hue that faded into a dark red. It looked thick, like blood. 

“Charlie what the Hell is going on?!” My sister screamed through tears. 

“I don’t know, Chelsea! I don’t fucking know!”

I slammed my fist on the steering wheel as tears began streaming down my face. 

“Charlie, STOP!” 

I slammed on the brakes, the car swerved hard and we nearly went off the road. A giant red skinned crocodile with black scales protruding from its back and long black claws and teeth was crawling out from the flooding creek and onto the road right in front of us. Chelsea screamed. I threw the car in reserve and made a quick u-turn, and hit the gas. 

“Oh my God oh my God oh my God….” Chelsea cried. “What’s happening… what’s happening?!”

All I could do was cry and drive. I pulled back into the driveway of Jerry Bed and Breakfast and slammed on the brakes. I turned to my sister. 

“Go inside and get as much of our stuff as you can. I’ll meet you back here in five minutes.” 

“Charlie, where are you going?” 

“I have to make sure Clara and Bob are okay.” 

I slammed the door and took off toward Twin Caves. 

“Charlie, no!” Chelsea screamed. She stood by the open door of the car, already drenched by the pouring rain. 

“I’ll be fine! If I’m not back in five minutes, you leave!” 

I didn’t stick around for an answer. I ran all the way to the edge of the pit. The Johnson’s rappelling gear still attached, but the rope wasn’t taught. I leaned over the edge. The rope dangled halfway down the pit, frayed at the end. It had been cut. Horrified, I looked down into the bottom of the pit. 

“Charlie? Is that you?” It was Miss Clara. She was laying at the bottom on her back, her body contorted unnaturally and a pool of blood growing beneath her. 

“Oh no…” I gasped. “Miss Clara, it’s me. You’re gonna be okay! We’re gonna get help! Where’s Bob?” 

“I… I don’t know…” She said weakly. “I… don’t remember.” 

“He’s gonna be alright, Clara. We’ll get you help, we’ll get you out of there and we’ll find him I promise!” 

She gazed up at the sky, a dazed look in her eyes. She knew she was dying.

“I was a good person… I’ll go to Heaven, Charlie… I know I’ll go to Heaven…” 

She started reciting Hail Marys. I felt hot tears mix with cold rain on my cheeks. I stood up and looked around. I didn’t know what to do. I had more rappelling rope in the car, but her body was clearly too damaged for me to bring her up alone. This would require a professional rescue team. And there was probably no time for that. In a hopeless effort, I pulled out my phone and attempted to dial 911. No service. I tried again and again, but got nothing. 

I heard it again: the winds of Hell. The sound came up from the pit and filled my heart with dread. I went back and leaned slowly over the edge, afraid of what I’d see. 

Miss Clara was gone. There was nothing left of her but a long bloody drag mark from where she had lain broken on the ground to the right side cave entrance. The wind faded away as I stared in horror. 

I ran back to the car as fast as I could. Chelsea was shoving wet suitcases and rain soaked pillows into the back seat. I ripped the door open and threw myself into the drivers seat. 

“Let’s go! Now!” I cried as I hastily  ranked my key in the ignition. 

Chelsea got in the passenger side quickly and slammed the door shut. 

“Where’s Miss Clara?” She asked as we backed out, her brow furrowed in concern. I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. Chelsea leaned back into her seat and quietly sobbed. 


Pt 3- “Collection”


We went the opposite direction from the first time we left, and went straight out of town. The rain was unrelenting, and I knew it would be dangerous if we didn’t get out of town as soon as possible. We had to flee. There was no time to think about anything that just happened, no point in trying to get help. I drove us straight out of Alabama, and didn’t stop until we got low on gas. 

Chelsea and I didn’t speak the entire way home. She hardly even moved. I didn’t ask her to drive. She became despondent, almost unresponsive. I could hardly get her to eat or drink water. When we got back to my apartment in Washington, she just grabbed her bags and walked to her car without even saying goodbye. My heart broke as I watched her walk away. 

That was the time I ever saw my sister. The entire town of Jerry was completely destroyed by the massive flood, with hundreds dead or missing. It was devastating news. I felt responsible. I couldn’t bring myself to call my sister, and I feel terribly guilty for that. I probably always will. 

About six months later, I got a call from a hospital in Seattle. My sister had taken her life. I was listed as her next of kin. Her ashes arrived in the mail yesterday. That’s all I have left of my family: a little wooden box that reads “Chelsea Brooks, beloved daughter, granddaughter, and sister. 1993 - 2024.” She lost something in that cave that day. Something she never got back. A part of her essence, her humanity. Her soul. After everything I’ve seen, I still don’t believe in God… 
But I do believe in Hell.
