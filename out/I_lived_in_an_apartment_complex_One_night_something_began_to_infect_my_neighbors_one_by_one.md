When you get used to an apartment life, you grow what I call, an “apartment mentality”. You start thinking about your room as a different world.

It stops crossing your mind that someone else is living a completely different life right next to you. Maybe you’re one wall away from some kind of freak or murderer.

Sometimes, I think the worlds is like that. I think we’re all in one big apartment complex. Room after room, world after world, all mostly identical. Mostly. There are ‘odd’ worlds next to us, just like there are “odd” rooms.

Some rooms have bulbs that give off a yellow, infected light over the walls and black mold grows in the corners. Some rooms have no lights at all and the only sound in the dark is a mouthless breathing. Some rooms have no people but aren't empty.

Occasionally, we can hear sounds from the other rooms. At nights, we might hear knocking.

I'm sorry. I don’t mean to be morbid. Some images keep coming back to me. I’ll try to be straightforward from now, but I can’t make promises. These memories I’m about to share, have a habit of fogging my mind.

I don’t want to remember what happened that night. This is the last time I’ll tell this story

This is what happened to my apartment complex, one night. When the lights went out.


Our brain hangs onto the funniest things, doesn’t it? The artificial shade of red in the receptionist’s hair when you go in to see the dentist. The way your high school English room smelled after thunder. 

What I remember first about that night is the cold. I don’t think it’s ever dropped that low in October before, not where I was living. In the end, it might’ve been what saved me.


Looking back, that apartment block, to put it nicely - I've seen nicer crack dens.  If it was a dog, they'd have put it down.

 But I was young and I was broke. Fresh out of college, no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no funds to actually do anything with my life. So I got a room for cheap. Turns out, 'Cheap’ meant a landlord that could not have given a single shit about the people living there. Rolling blackouts came monthly, plunging us all into the dark.


That’s why I noticed the cold. I was due a spin on the bad-luck wheel. Mould on the ceiling, no hot water, backed-up drains. That night of all nights, I was dreading a power cut.

My first port of call was my nextdoor neighbour. From the little I knew, he was an agreeable guy, and knowing how fast the landlord didn’t work, I figured we’d have more leverage if it was two of us complaining. 

As I stepped out into the dark corridor, my foot slid across the floor.  I only just caught myself before I slid far enough to snap my ankle. Something wet and sticky splashed and squealed around my shoes.

Feeling my way to the door, I rapped on the wood a couple of times. From inside, there was no reply. Either he wasn’t in or he didn’t care.  Yeah. On another day I might’ve sympathized, but when you can’t run a hot shower or cook your microwave dinner, it doesn’t put you in the best mood. 

As I went to knock again, the wood moved in. The door was open . Just a crack. I shouldn’t have… but I did,

 It was dark in there . I had to feel my way past the front door. At first, I thought I was right. Another blackout.

But soon my eyes adjusted, and I noticed this faint glimmer of light coming from the ceiling, where the bulb would be. Know how you can see the glow of the sun behind dark clouds? The bulb was filthy


For the longest time it just wouldn’t compute. I’d never seen dust that thick. 

Then I glanced at the wall.

Not dust. A long streak of what could almost be mould, oozing up the plaster, paint peeling away beneath. Spanning the ceiling, reaching out to the bulb. 

Choking off its light.

I know I should have run. I should’ve burned the whole place down. ‘Sunlight is the best disinfectant’. Easy to say that now. 

But in that moment all I could do was follow the path of that… stuff. I didn’t even remember crossing the room. 

It was cool and slick beneath my fingers. It reminded me of…

When I was six, I managed to get my dad’s matches down from the kitchen cabinet and accidentally set fire to the carpet. 

That’s what it reminded me of. That warning panic.  

I followed it all the way through the apartment. Hunting it through the dark. I’d been here before, even once in a power cut. Never like this. 

Framed posters loomed, cast in shadow. Cracked glass on the floor. Piles of cast-off clothes tracked over with dark slime. He’d never been a neat freak, my neighbour, but this was something else.

I caught myself crouching low. Walking slow. Holding my breath. As if there was something in the room might hear me and come near me.

The trail ended at the bedroom door. That too was pulled shut but not locked. I’d come that far. I had to know.

He lay on his single bed on top of the sheets. Eyes closed. 

He should have been cold in just boxers. The water in the puddles on the street was this close to freezing, but his flesh did not shiver.

As I bent down to look, I saw a hazy grin run up his face like a scar. Black liquid drooled out of his mouth.

“Hello?”

He didn't reply. It was almost a relief. 

I didn’t want to explain why I was standing over his bed. I thought he was high on something, maybe, and that was a relief. Drugs I can understand, especially in that shithole. 

If only I could have believed that.

His bedroom - like mine - was small and boxy. I remember there was a crack in his wall, running from the window to the corner. 

I gazed up at it. It was filled in now. It was leaking. It was pouring out a thick, black liquid onto the floor.

Once I saw that, everything else in the room I didn't notice before came into focus.
 
It was dark in the room. The light switch was flipped on but the bulb gave not even a glow anymore

The window was single plane glass. That night, I couldn’t see the orange flare of the street lamps below through the window. The glass was too thick with a black and glistening slime. 

 It was dark in the room and cold and bleak, but my neighbour’s rictus grin was so wide  his jaw split wide open.
 
His fingers twitched, and beneath the lids, the eyes rolled back and forth. Once, his head turned and I saw a thick red welt out the base of his skull.  It leaked a dark pus into the pillow.

He was the first I found. I think I was too late by then. I hope so.


When my brain finally took control of my body, I ran. 

In the blind and mad semidarkness, I had forgotten about the spill on the floor.  My foot skidded.  I fell face first into the thick liquid.
 
As I came back to my senses, I could taste blood. I checked my mouth for cuts, but soon realized that wasn’t the source.  I lifted my hand up from the puddle I was now sitting in, and looked closer.

The same black slime drooled over my hands. It wasn't blood. At least, human blood.
 
 I stood up slowly this time, sane again but just barely. I spat out the slime in my mouth, and gazed across the floor, following the trail of the spill with my eyes.

It led to my other neighbour’s room. An old man, he should've been in a care home. No one talked to him anymore, no kids, no family.  

We were all like that in the building. We didn't even talk to each other unless we had to. Talk only brought the situation home.

I'm a stupidly sentimental guy, so don't yell at me too much for what I did next. I wanted to help. I didn't feel like I could leave someone I sort of knew. 

I carefully pushed on the door.  As the door moved about an inch, a horrid stench from inside assaulted my nose. I took a step back, covering my nose. 

That smell was far too obvious, it smelt like rotten meat. Now before courage inside me withered, I opened the whole door and took a peep inside.

A dirty bulb's glow cast over all. The black slimy substance covered the whole area, and a decaying body was submerged inside of it. 

I could make out the overgrown hair of my neighbour, and that was enough for me. I closed the door and emptied my dinner onto the floor. 

As I was picking myself back up, my ears picked up on a disturbance nearby. It was coming from my room

I inched closer to my room, not in a rush. I put my ear to the  door, and listened. Something inside was moving around. As I edged a little bit closer though, I lost my balance on the slime and fell in.

In an insane panic, I looked up, expecting some foul creature that was going around murdering my neighbours, only to be look into the eyes of a roughed up, slime covered cat.

It was the stray I had been feeding. He came visiting to my apartment through the window (there was tree near there)for some food. I liked meeting it everyday, it made me think there was at least one dude in the world who thought I was useful. It saddened me when he stopped visiting a week ago, but I figured something had happened or he had moved on from here, onto a better place.

I almost mistook the poor creature for dead at first glance. I was ready to just grimace and move on, but seeing its ragged chest rise and fall faintly, I knew I couldn’t. I stepped further into the room, my shoes squelching under the slime and gristle staining the floor. 

The cat was lying in a puddle of slime, eyes staring, unblinking. And yet, judging by the breaths, it was inexplicably still alive. I scooped up the cat with little protest, cradling its body to my chest. No noise, no protest from the animal, just its ragged breathing.

I needed to get out of here.

I left my room. I didn’t exactly want, or really miss, any of my possessions anymore. The thought of them crusted with slime and mould made my empty stomach twist. 

The hallway was somehow even worse. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, were practically oozing with a reeking slurry that slid and dripped like tar. It sure smelt like it. I instinctively held the cat closer to myself, giving the poor thing a comforting scratch to the cheek. But I had to get out of this horrible building, so I had no choice but to progress through the gore, hand clamped firmly over my nose, the other supporting the thin cat.

As I tiptoed along to the elevator, I realised that it wasn’t entirely silent. It wasn’t the tinny hum of a fluorescent overhead lamp, but a shuffling. A quiet shuffling, like hundreds and thousands of tiny somethings brushing and moving against one another. The source was indeterminable. It seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere, and I was certain I was hallucinating it if it wasn’t for the cat’s ears twitching.

It could hear it too.

The slime wasn’t moving normally. It occurred to me as I was about halfway down the accursed hallway to the elevator. It should’ve slid straight down the wall, but it wasn’t. It was, excruciatingly slowly, twisting and turning. Moving left and right. Some drips even reversed direction, and crept back up the wall. My breathing quickened with the cats. I didn’t want to get closer. I wanted to investigate. I didn’t want to endanger the cat.

I got close enough just to see faint protrusions peeking from the slime. Raised little spirals.

Hundreds of them.

I walked a bit faster.

And yet I couldn’t help but freeze when I felt the floor beneath me crunch. My shoes were slick with the black slime, something darker floating within the tar.

Shells.

Snail shells.

This place was infested with them. Slowly moving, slowly crawling. Spreading their slime. Killing my neighbours.

I had to get out of here.

Reaching the doors, I thumped the elevator button. I wouldn't have trusted it at worked the best of times but I wasn't taking the stairs in the situation. Besides the elevator door, I could see the stairs lead down into an inky darkness

As the numbers ticked up, slow and uncertain. I began to be aware of another noise.

It echoed. a shuffling noise

They were coming from the emergency stairway. Something was coming up the stairs. In the sparse hallway lights, I saw them emerging.

Hundreds of faces floated out of the dark . Sobbing faces, leaking black liquid out of every orifice.

*The lonely faces, the rotting faces*

Oh god, they were part of something *else* .

The faces were trapped on an titanic shell. The shell of something rising towards me. 

I was so absorbed into the twisting, calling patterns of the shell, the pathetic pile of sludge at it's base fell into the background. 

Until I saw a slimy *human* hand reach out from the slimy mess and pull along the shell of faces towards me

Until I saw the pale blurred face of a old man from inside the sludge, staring at me. Talking to me.

*Come back. I'm sorry. Don't leave your father alone down here*

The elevator doors opened. Without looking away from the stairway monstrosity, I stepped in. 

That was a mistake. I knew as I felt a cold wet hand fell on my shoulder and an little girl's voice whispered

*Mama. Why did you leave me?*

Without looking back at whatever was in the elevator with me, I jumped back into the hallway. 

*Don't leave me again mama. Don't let them take me alone*

I began sobbing as I stumbled my way back down the hallway, away from the elevator door and the stairway. I couldn't breathe in the terror.

No plan, no way to go. 

Die in the dark, go mad in the cold wet dark.

In this state, I felt claws digging into my arms. The stray cat burst out of my arms. It weakly pushed in the direction of my room, before turning around and looking at me.

The tree. There was a tree outside my window

I picked up my weakened companion and began that long, long run down the hallway. 

From my neighbour's apartments, I could hear whispers, calling out to me. Doors were opening,  were coming undone, my mind was falling apart

I think I was crying. I think I screamed and sobbed.

My next sane memory was of my apartment window. The open window, out of the dark and empty cave

The branches looked so far away, like the hands of fickle friends. 

The cat was in my arms but I wouldn't let it down. I think i would have gone insane before i let it go.

I needed to leave the building any way, any how. I couldn't stay there alive and sane. I had to jump. Either way the fall shook out, I had to jump. 

If there was nothing but the ground below, I would have jumped anyways.

So I looked at the branches and that fall and the horrible distance below.

And I jumped.

I no longer live in apartment block. Me and my cat, we're not picky. I can't say we've landed on our feet yet, but we can manage

After that night, no one contacted me. There was no police investigation. No missing persons report. The building stood but no one cared.

I'm not surprised. If I hadn't gotten out, my own family wouldn't have cared. Like I said, we were all like that. To everyone else, nothing of value was lost  

The landlord died the night before, and with him, the only interest in our survival.  We were a collection of abandoned toys on the playground, and eventually, a stranger sat down to play.

So what happened that night? I don't know, but I believe certain things.

I believe mold grows in the corners no one sees, there are maggots that feed on lonely things. There might be another form of rot, a fungus that seeps through dimensions and grows on the forgotten prey.

Even now, the apartment complex stands abandoned. No one comes, no one goes. I hope it stays that way.

These days, my legs are healing quite well. So is my Tara, my cat. Yeah, I was wrong about the gender. The memories, those are a different matter. I hope this will be the last day I think about that night

Oh and I have another theory.

Why didn't I or Tara change? Why were we able to leave? 

I think when we saw each other, neither of us felt entirely abandoned.
