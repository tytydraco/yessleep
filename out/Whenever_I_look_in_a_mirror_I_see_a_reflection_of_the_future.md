And the Gloamer.

My earliest memory is one of a pool party at Harry Larson’s house. I didn’t see the chipper faces of my toddler pals reflected in the surface of the water — instead, I saw Mr Larson doing laps. He wasn’t even at the house that day. He was on a business trip.

I started crying, so my parents took me home. I was only 3, so I couldn’t effectively verbalise what had upset me, but the visions didn’t stop there. I saw things that were misaligned with reality in every reflective surface. I never saw reflections of the present moment.

“Ricky has a vivid imagination,” My mum explained to the psychiatrist. “He sees things that aren’t really there.”

“But only when he looks at mirrors?” Dr Tunstall asked.

“*All* reflections,” My mum replied. “Could it be schizophrenia?”

“I’m hesitant to diagnose Ricky just yet,” The doctor replied. “It could be his way of expressing an overactive imagination. Let’s keep an eye on things, shall we?”

I was young, but old enough to know that my claims were being dismissed. And that’s when I started to hide my prophetic power. I didn’t know what the doctor’s big words meant, but I remember being perturbed by the tones of voice that were used in that room.

So, from the age of 4 onwards, I pretended to be like any other kid. Yes, Mum, of course I see myself in the mirror. Nothing and nobody else.

Look, I get their skepticism. As an adult, I would probably accept the hallucination diagnosis.

But on July 7th, 2004, 9-year-old me saw Liam falling backwards in the reflection of a car’s pearlescent surface — my friend who was gleefully playing football with me at the time.

An hour later, when the car sped off the driveway, the horrifying prophecy came true. Little Liam was hit by the reversing vehicle and rushed to hospital. And I finally realised what I saw in reflections.

The future.

I finally embraced the terrible truth that I had no psychological issues. Well, none in the sense that my mother and doctor imagined. It was the first time I’d seen the events depicted in a reflection come to life.

And it wouldn’t be the last.

I’m 28 years old. For years, my prophecies have been mundane. Nothing as sinister as that fateful summer afternoon with my childhood friend. Of course, I wouldn’t be here if I had no more stories to tell. In fairness, I always thought my ability to be terrifying in itself — an anomaly with no explanation.

But I saw the true face of terror two months ago. Nothing’s been the same since.

I work as a graphic designer in Manchester. The city of a million mirrors. Commuters litter the pavements, but different faces pass by in the ground-level windows of skyscrapers. Sometimes, even in the early morning, those glassy towers reflect a blackened sky and the orange glow of streetlights. It could be a reflection of the street on that same night, or a night three years into the future. I have no way of knowing.

Anyway, two months ago, I saw something unsettling in the window of a particular city centre building. Something I’d never seen in a reflection before.

The present.

But that wasn’t what frightened me. Once the initial shock subsided, I found myself focusing on a disturbing detail in the background. Something was squatting beneath the menu sign for a restaurant. A horrid thing, shrivelled and gaunt-faced. A demented interpretation of a man.

Horrified, I twisted my head to find nothing beneath the real-life sign. When I returned my gaze to the window, I was faced with a reflection of that same street in the future. Different faces. Different cars. Everything was back to ‘normal’.

However, every morning that followed, the malevolent man revealed himself in reflections for a fleeting moment, around dusk. The hour of the gloaming. And that’s how I came to name the terrible, inexplicable spectre.

It wasn’t the present that would come to haunt me. As always, it was the future. And the Gloamer would prove himself to be not a warning but a promise.

“Drinks after work?” Holly asked.

“Of course. That’s got to be a statement, not a question?” I said, grinning.

“You’re okay with Anna coming, right?” Terry asked.

“Course,” Holly replied. “Not sure about you though.”

At 5pm, we all piled into Holly’s car, and that was when I noticed something odd. Her rearview mirror reflected blackness. So, I cast my eyes to the wing mirror. And in it, I saw a different reflection. A scarcely-lit, scenic road at twilight.

I thought nothing of it, as I rarely think anything of my visions. Reflections rarely depict events that I end up witnessing. Not since Liam.

“Shit,” Terry slurred after hours of clubbing. “We’re gonna miss the last train, Anna. And how are you getting back, Ricky?”

“Don’t be silly,” Holly scoffed, rolling her eyes. “Why do you think I stopped after one drink? I’m the designated driver. I’ll get all of you home.”

On the drive out of the city, I found myself pressed against the passenger window  — blurry-eyed, with my ears ringing from a lethal concoction of club music and Terry’s tone-deaf singing. Familiar scenery rolled by. A landscape I’d already seen. Countryside illuminated by dregs of dawning light.

It was the road that I’d seen in the wing mirror earlier. However, on this 4am drive, that same glass pane reflected only darkness, much like the rearview mirror.

Holly groaned. “What is this?”

A large red sign in the road read:

*Diversion: Turn Right*

The colours swam in my tired, inebriated vision, but they were just as familiar to me as the country road itself. I realised I’d seen the sign before. Before our night out, I’d seen those words reversed in the front windshield of Holly’s car.

I was deeply unnerved by the number of premonitions that I was seeing unfold with my very eyes. I couldn’t quite put my finger on what was disturbing me, but my stomach was twisting and tightening.

And as we veered off down the right-hand country lane, I was certain, if only for a moment, that a burst of light filled the blackened wing mirror. It revealed a ghoulish glimpse of the present.

The Gloamer was crouching behind the road sign.

The horror had twisted his lifeless, decomposing face in the direction of our car. Yellow, maggot-ridden eyes locked onto mine. Terrified by the phantom that stalked us, and unable to resolve the sense of impending doom in my chest, I murmured in a drunken panic.

The vision in the wing mirror was quickly replaced by a reflection of blackness.

“You okay, champ?” Holly chuckled. “I think two ciders might have been two too many for you, eh?”

“HOLLY!” Anna screamed.

She only took her eyes off the road for a moment, but it was all over in a matter of seconds. We were upside down, engulfed by a brutish blanket of crumpled metal.

The 2-foot-deep pothole was an unmarked hazard that should’ve been filled by the council years ago. And that was when I recalled all of the other signs that I’d missed over the weeks since first encountering the Gloamer.

You see, so many things in our world are reflective. People’s eyes, for instance. And I used to stare into Holly’s brilliantly blue marbles every single day. Lost in her gentle gaze. Oblivious to the horrifying reflection of the future that I’d seen in her pupils.

Broken, red-tinged glass. A figure at the end of a dark road.

A sight that made sense as I regained consciousness and slowly wriggled my battered body through the passenger door and onto the grass.

Rolling onto my back, I whimpered at the flattened back-end of the wreckage — Terry and Anna were pancaked. And Holly’s twitching body hung, still seat-belted, in the upside-down driver’s seat, impaled by glass and metal. Her near-lifeless blue eyes mirrored the scene of horror that I’d seen countless times over countless weeks. A premonition that I’d overlooked. Shards of glass. Blood.

And as I lay on the tarmac, sobbing at the accident that had consumed three of my friends, the sound of crunching gravel drew my gaze to the top of the road.

At the outermost reach of the car headlights’ glow, I saw the Gloamer.

But not in a reflection.

I screeched until my throat cracked, and the ghoulish abomination scurried on hands and feet into the darkness. Blackness quickly consumed me, and I woke alone in the hospital.

Weeks have passed since then. But the Gloamer hasn’t gone away.

Even in my visions of the future, I’m certain I always see that crouching figure in the distance. Watching and waiting.

I can’t even drink a glass of water without fearing that those horrible yellow eyes might be staring back at me.

When will this nightmare end?
