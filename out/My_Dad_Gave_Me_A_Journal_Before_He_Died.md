Before my dad died, he gave me his uncle’s old journal. My dad taught me everything I know, and even though the journal wasn’t his, I couldn’t bring myself to open it. Grief totals all. It took time for me to accept what had happened. I didn’t read the journal until yesterday; I just couldn’t before now. 

But I’m not here to reopen an already fresh wound. I’m here to find answers. This journal my dad gave me it’s not... normal. What's in here doesn’t fit into the world I know. Frankly, what’s in my great uncle’s journal changes me, it changes everything—it might even change you.

But I need your help. Help me understand.

The cover was worn and weathered, with a strange symbol embossed on the front. I felt a shiver run down my spine the first time I opened it.

Inside, the journal is filled with drawings and old photos, accompanying each one are cryptic notes in my great uncle’s handwriting. Some photos are in color some aren't, some of them are so old that they’re starting to fade. But it’s what’s in them that’s truly unsettling.

A painting… or as my great uncles handwriting explains it a “self portrait” 

This is the first non-blank page (aside from the nonsensical scribbles). It's not overly complex, but it's stunningly impressive. I come from a military family, and as you can imagine, we are not known for our artistic characteristics. Still, as I type this and look at my great uncle’s self-portrait again, I can’t shake the idea that I’ve seen this painting somewhere before receiving this journal. There's something eerily familiar about it that I can’t quite place.

I never met my great uncle; he died before I was born. My dad told me that he was buried at sea. The thought of him painting this self-portrait, maybe knowing he wouldn’t live long enough for us to meet, adds an extra layer of mystery and emotion. Was this how he saw himself in his final days, or is there a deeper, hidden meaning behind this image?

The second painting in the journal is entitled “It Came at Night.”

I don’t have any ideas on this one. What came at night? Who is the boy pointing? What is he even pointing at? 

My family is from New Orleans and migrated to NYC in the 60s after a family member went missing one Christmas night. To me, the cool blue color of the paint, accompanied by what looks like trees from a bayou out the window, suggests this might be a memory my great uncle had from his childhood. The painting evokes a sense of eerie calm and underlying tension, as if something sinister is lurking just beyond the window.

Entitled “Me & Kasy

This is the first photo I was able to find in the journal. I will say it looks like some pages have been hastily ripped out, so there could be more images I'm missing.

I do remember hearing about Kasy, my grandmother's childhood dog, and clearly my great uncle's too. That being said, I’m glad I never met Kasy – that dog looks absolutely terrifying. The photo shows Kasy with an unsettling glare. Forget the snarling, the eyes don't look right to me. It's strange to think that a beloved family pet could be depicted in such a menacing way. Did my great uncle see something in Kasy that others didn't? Or is this just a trick of the light and old film? The missing pages make me wonder if there’s more to this story.

Entitled “The Christmas Dad Left”

My family has never celebrated Christmas; my dad didn’t allow us to. As I mentioned before, and as this photo notes, his grandfather disappeared one Christmas night. Apparently, a week later, the entire family moved.

In terms of what’s in the photo, I have no ideas. Is this my great-grandfather? Maybe its a fun yet creepy image of him dressing up as Santa. Is this the last image of him before he vanished? Why did my great uncle have this image in his journal?

The mystery of my great-grandfather’s disappearance has always haunted our family, and this image only adds to the enigma.

Entitled “The 8 Polski Brothers After The War”

Polski is my grandmother's maiden name. My family has a history of having a lot of kids and having them young. I used to joke with friends that our family was raising an army to fight in a not-yet-seen war. Like I said, I come from a military family. So maybe lunchroom jokes were my unconscious beliefs.

I don’t know.

To me, this looks like some next-level Halloween decorations. It's impossible to place the time frame, though. The image is faded and old. The "war" could've been WWI or even the Civil War for all I know. What bothers me is the 8 in the title of the image. It should only be 7 brothers.

Entitled “The Day They Arrived”

This is why I made this post. This is inexplicable. I know this street—it's in New York City near Central Park. Whatever this is, it defies explanation. I think I'd hear about a giant monster arriving in NYC in the 60's. It would be all anyone talked about. It would change the world. Our lives, everything.

I don't know what to believe and need your help. Help me.
