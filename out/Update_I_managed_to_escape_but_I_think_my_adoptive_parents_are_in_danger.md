Hey there everyone! So, I have an update. Sorry for not posting earlier but the man started getting annoyed with me fumbling around with my phone. I told him I was just checking up with friends to tell them I'd be late, but at some point he told me to put it away. He was very sharp about it and I got scared. 

When I posted, some of you started commenting urging me to not drink the tea. It also looks like you guys are more aware of my situation here than I am myself. 

Although it was advised by strangers on the internet, I decided to take your advice. It was hard though. 

At first, I thought I could just get by without drinking the tea. However, the man started to grow more and more impatient.

-Why are you not drinking the tea?

-I... I'm nauseated, sorry.

-OK, but keep it. It will be good for you. It's a really good tea and it helps with upset stomachs.

-OK, I will - I smiled.

-So - he sat on a rock beside me - tell me. What's your name?

-Lizzie.

-Hello Lizzie. What a nice name, - he said, without ever introducing himself - is it short for Elisa?

-Huh... - I remembered the comments telling me to be careful and decided to lie - no, it's actually Elizabeth.

In fact, it is short for Elisa. Apparently, my biological mother asked my mom to keep the name she had given me, and she complied. It struck me as weird that this man just went straight to Elisa, since it's a more common short name for Elizabeth. 

-Humm... I see... - he squinted - and how old are you Lizzie?

The truth slipped out of my lips

-I'm 20.

I chastised myself internally for sharing that piece of information. His eyes seemed to sparkle and I knew I had screwed up. 

-I see, I see... Wonderful age. And what are you doing around town?

How did he know I was not from around here? Everything seemed to start clicking into place, showing me I was in real danger. I put my hand in my pocket and disabled my phone's sound. 

-I came to see some friends. How did you know I am visiting? 

His eyes squinted as if he had hit his finger with a hammer. He realized he'd messed up. 

-I... You know... It's a small town. I've never seen you around. I just... Took a guess! - the man shrugged and smiled.

I smiled and nodded, my insides scrambled in fear. 

As we were talking, I fussed around in my pocket to dial for help. It caught his attention.

-What's up with your pocket?

-Oh! Nothing! My hand is itchy, that's all - I lied. He looked suspicious but seemed to believe it.

-Well it's about time you drink that tea. Come on, bottom's up.

I realized I couldn't stall for longer without looking suspicious. I had to come up with a plan. It was time to bring my clumsy self to action. 

I got up as I was taking a big sip. I kept the tea in my mouth and pretended to swallow. Right after I was up, I pretended to trip and spilled the tea, along with spitting the one I had in my mouth. With all the commotion, he didn't notice I was spitting.

-Shit! You clumsy girl! - he yelled, clearly frustrated. 

-Oh, I'm so sorry!

He sighed. 

-You drank a bit, at least, didn't you?

-I did, it was very nice, thank you. - I lied.

He seemed to relax and smiled. There was something utterly creepy about that smile. 

-OK, good... Good. Soon, it will all be OK. You won't even remember any of this happened.

I shivered. I remembered the comment about my mother being drugged and not remembering anything. It made sense. This is the man who hurt my mother.

-When is the team coming?

-Don't worry about it, it comes when it comes.

-Can't I leave? It's getting dark.

-No. You were the one who found the bodies. You have to stay to give your statement.

He wasn't going to let me leave. I went for a Hail Mary.

-OK but my mom will be looking for me. She knows I'm in town, I need to call her to let her know.

He looked at me and seemed to ponder his opinions for a moment. Having someone looking for me didn't seem to amuse him, so he told me to call her.

I took my phone and dialed 911. I stepped away just enough for him to not hear the voice on the other side and lowered the speaker's volume.

-911, what's your emergency?

-Hey mom! It's me, Lizzie! I'm going to be late today.

The respondent seemed to pick up on my queue. 

-Ma'am are you unable to talk freely?

-Yes, exactly.

-OK. Are you in immediate danger?

-I think so mom, I'm not sure when I'm going back home. I found something unsettling in the woods, I'm here with a gentleman, he says he's a detective, but I can't leave right now.

-Are you being coerced to stay by this man?

-Yep, that's it. Yeah, the woods near Franklin, exactly.

-OK ma'am, stay in line, I have officers on your way, we were able to trace your call.

-Yeah, no, I don't think I can.

The man stared at me and yelled "Whats taking so long?".

-OK ma'am I understand. Keep the call going, mute your speaker and lock your phone. Put it in your pocket and act normal. I will stay here to make sure everything is going fine and you'll get help soon. 

-OK mom, love you! See you later.

I did as instructed. Speaker muted, locked phone in my pocket, I sat back next to the man.

-How are you feeling? - he asked?

-Mostly ok, I think.

-OK, in about 10 minutes things will start to get better.

-Is the team arriving?

-Huh... Something like that.

I assumed he was talking about the tea. I had no idea what the effect should be, so I just sat there, quiet and idle. I got lost in thoughts and, without noticing, found myself looking into the distance. 

-Finally, I see the tea is working. Let's try it. Repeat after me. "My name is Elisa".

I didn't move an inch. Apparently, staring into the horizon was what was expected of me.

-My name is Elisa.

-"I am 20 years old".

-I am 20 years old.

-"I live in Franklin with my dad, Rob".

Wait, what? Was this guy trying to reprogram me? Was that what the tea was for? 

-I live in Franklin with my dad, Rob.

-"I don't know anybody apart from my dad, who's here with me".

-I don't know anybody apart from my dad, who's here with me. 

I could hear sirens in the distance. Apparently, he could hear them too, because he stood up suddenly and stared at me. 

-You little bitch... OK, repeat this exact phrase when I ask you to. "This is my dad, we found these bodies while on a hike, I want to go home now, please".

A police car pulled up, followed by another one. Two men with heavy guns exited from each. 

-Hello officers, what seems to be the problem?

-Sir, identify yourself.

-I... I was just taking a hike with my daughter here whe-

-Sir... Identify. Yourself. NOW!

-Just ask my daughter, I'm telling the truth. Honey, tell these men who I am.

I stood up, pretending I was going to talk to the officers to repeat the phrase he had said before. As soon as I was close enough, I sprinted behind the police car. 

-Please help me! He tried to drug me! I was the one who called!

The officers shielded me. The man (Rob?) shouted "SHIT!", turned around and started running away. Three officers sprinted after him, guns in hand, and the fourth one stood with me. Finally out of his sight, I let my emotions overcome me and broke down, sobbing.

-You're safe now miss. I will take you back to the local police station.

At the police station, I spent most of the night giving statements and describing the man so they could draw one of those portraits they do when there are no pictures. I spent the rest of the night here because they thought it was safer to take me home in the morning. I called my mom and filled her in. She was scared out of her mind. 

Some minutes ago, my mom called me again.

-Honey? Where are you?

-Still at the police station, why?

-There's a detective here at our door, says he needs to talk? I thought they were supposed to bring you along.
