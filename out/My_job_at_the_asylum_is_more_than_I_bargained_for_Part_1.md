I have to get this off my chest, as it seems that it could potentially help my anxiety according to the web.

I have been working at this asylum as a nurse for little over 3 months so I am still in a training period until my 6 month mark (company policy apparently) but something is very very wrong here. We do the normal kind of thing you would expect such as tending to the patients, giving their medication etc.   
  
But sometimes, some patients simply disappear. Some senior nurses and doctors that are on the night shift keep on saying that it is not the concern of trainees to know. But, in a little snooping around while listening in on some conversations I had pieced together that the patients go through some kind of ‘special procedure at a different level in the building. Which I find it odd as the building simply has 3 levels, all of which I have access to, hence, I cannot piece together what level they are talking about. There have also been some loose talks from a nurse that had wanted to quit.   
  
She was incoherent, blabbering about some project conducted here that she had witnessed with her own two eyes. The next day she didn’t come back to work, she didn’t answer her emails and she didn’t answer her phone which made me worried. I planned on paying her a visit after my shift was done. This was the plan until the management sent us an email.   
  
*‘Dear valued employees of WoodFowler Corp. We had heard your concerns about one of our hard working nurses and how her job was affecting her mental health. We are truly sorry to have witnessed such a burn out from a member of staff hence, we have taken the liberty to send her on a mental health betterment plan. She is fine, away from her troubles on a luxury cruise paid for by the company.*   
  
*Thank you so much for your cooperation and we encourage you to tell us whenever this difficult line of work gets to be too much to handle as we want to help everyone have a better quality of life and work.’*  
  
I thought that this was odd however, she wasn’t the friendly type to check in on everyone and maybe the company wanted to settle outside of court hence the cruise.   
  
I went on with my job until today an old patient returned to his bed. He had some serious deformations across his face and he was wailing in pain. The doctors were able to stabilise him.   
  
I was put in charge to attend to his needs while the medication did his effect as I was now a ‘trustworthy colleague’ according to a senior doctor on the ward.   
  
About half an hour later, the patient began to growl a name in his sleep. The patient was sleeping but he kept on mentioning a doctor. A name that I haven’t ever heard of before. I couldn’t quite make out the exact name, It sounded like sab, schap… something along those lines. I was a bit perplexed, scared but curious. I listened in as he began to loudly scream 'NIGHTMARES, THEY ARE HERE, HE DID THIS TO ME, NIGHTMARES! NIGHTMARES! STOP! STOP! DON'T TAKE ME PLEASEEEEEEE! MAKE THEM STOP NOW!'

He pulled me in by my collar screaming bloody murder which made me tear up and cry. 

His saliva and blood from the now opening wounds on his face was dripping on my face as he screamed.

'MAKE HIM STOP! MAKE THEM STOP! I AM BEGGING YOU! THEY ARE EVIL! THE DOCTORS! CEOS! STOP! NIGHTMARES STOPSTOPSTOPSTOPSTOPSTOP!!!!' 

An army of nurses and doctors stormed in and sedated him. It took 10 injections to put him to sleep and fall back in his bed. 

I was trembling full of blood and saliva. Crying my eyes out. Another two nurses took me to the break room to shower and change my clothes. I was shaking and trembling still from what happened. 

He was fixed in my mind. His screams, the pain, anger, anguish, madness in his eyes. It was too much. 

I have to know what happened to him. Nobody goes this mad in a short span of a week away from here.

I need to know who this doctor is. 

I will try to dig more into the staff files to find something worthy of note. I will update as soon as I can.   
  
I need to find out if this new, hidden doctor is responsible for the mutilation that this patient had suffered on his face and for his hysteria. Maybe it’s connected to the other level of this asylum?   
I will try to find out as much as I can until my next update.

With all of this I couldn't help but wonder....did my co-worker get abducted to that level because of her depression as well?
