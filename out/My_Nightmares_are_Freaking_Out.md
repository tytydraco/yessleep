[My Nightmares are still Leaking](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12jbluv/my_nightmares_are_still_leaking/)

I'm Simran, a perpetually tired South-Asian American student struggling to get through each day. At school, I have to deal with my learning disabilities and behavioral problems caused by relentless bullying. At home, my parents take turns tormenting me. Not even sleep offers respite because my nightmares show me horrible, too-real visions of other worlds. Maybe by recounting them here, I can get closer to solving the mystery and towards a peaceful night's sleep...

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

I wake up nestled among the blankets in my living room. Only, it's not quite the den I'm familiar with. Little things are off. The walls warp in weird places, lengths and widths don't seem to be constant. Every blink yields a slightly different experience - I could've sworn the vase on the coffee table was white with blue painted flowers a second ago. Now it's green with red polka dots, holding up what appears to be a desiccated human middle finger with a long, clawlike nail flipping me off. Care to guess how I'll get screwed?

It's disorienting to look around the constantly transforming, variable room, so I decide to focus on the one spot that remains consistent - the TV. It's an older flat screen displaying static, quietly buzzing with that calm noise that sounds like ocean waves. I stare into the static void for a few moments, but I cannot shake the feeling that the movement I'm seeing out of the corner of my eyes isn't just the perpetually changing room. It's a perception that goes beyond peripheral vision, an instinctual feeling emanating from our lizard brains. I am being hunted.

I don't have time to dwell on this, however, as the TV springs to life with bright colors and cheerful sounds. I recognize it instantly as the theme song from Between the Lions. Just as I begin to feel some sense of familiarity, the song becomes corrupted - slowing down and speeding up at unexpected intervals. There are grinding sounds in the background, like city heavy construction noises...but _squishier_. And that horrible laugh. It starts low, but eventually builds to a fever pitch and drowns out everything else.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

[The puppet, Arty Smartypants, appears on the screen, dancing and laughing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixi3xsvcDaA) "So, smartypants, you already figured out the blinking? Guess I don't need to tell you -" \*I blink.\* "Dumbass! Ahahahahahaha." He is now across the coffee table from me, holding his pants with fleshy human hands and absolutely howling hysterically. There are no strings controlling him, and he is roughly the size of my leg. \*Must not blink. Must not blink. Must not -\*

"Anyway, as Arty was explaining, blinking is bad. Haha. Simon says blink!" \*I stare, my eyes dry.\* "Aha! Almost gotcha. Tonight, we are gonna dance and learn together. And it'll be fun, cuz we're gonna play a game." \*Must not blink. Must not blink.\* "When you inevitably close your eyes next, I'm gonna hand you a gun. And then - the fun begins!" \*Must not blink. Can't blink. Please stay open.\* "Okey-dokey, looks like our other guests are already here." The sliding glass door opens. Two towering mascot costumes walk in, ducking under the door frame - a bloody pink bunny and a dirty gray rat. They move with the bulk and strength of NFL linebackers, but I doubt anything remotely human is inside...if there's anything inside at all.

In my shock at their sudden appearance, I forget and \*blink.\* Now Arty is ontop of the coffee table. He has grown. He points a giant human hand at me and chortles. Stifling giggles, he says: "One job. You had one - haha! Anyway, as promised." \*Must not blink.\* I look down and see a large tan and black handgun in the puppet's too big hand. I take it as tears begin to well around my eyes. \*Must not blink.\* "Turn around." I do. With my back to Arty, I am greeted with an impossible situation.

"Now choose. The therapist or the boy?" The mascots are gathered in the dining room - one to my left and the other to my right. They loom over two scared, bruised figures kneeling on the floor - my therapist to my left and my best friend to my right. They are tied with thick ropes and gagged, the sweat plastering their matted hair to their faces. I \*blink\* past the sheen on their rough, pale faces to look into their pleading eyes. Oh shit.

"Ahah, ahah, ahahahaha." I am no longer sitting on the couch. I stand in the dining room, close enough to hear their whimpering cries. Close enough to smell the stench of the mascots; close enough to smell the fear of the two people I love most. "You have 10 seconds to decide. 10. 9. 8." \*Must not blink.\* I glance back and forth between them, unable to hold either gaze for long. \*Cannot blink.\*

My therapist is the first one who ever truly listened to me. She knew I wasn't defective, just in need of "extra maintenance" as she always put it. Her smile is warm and genuine. She truly cares and takes the time to help solve my problems. \*Don't blink.\*

Manuel is my best and only friend at school. We have a lot in common, and he always sits with me at lunch, even though I'm usually quiet. He makes fun of me too, but the gentle kind of ribbing between friends. He's never mean, and the only one that stands up for me. \*Don't blink.\*

"5. 4. 3. 2." I know what I have to do. They're both innocent. They're both good people. And I love them both, but there's one that I can't live without. One that I selfishly love more. I undo the safety, grip tight, aim, then squeeze the trigger. "1." The gunshot rings out, and the body of a beloved person drops to the floor. \*Blink - eyes held tightly closed.\*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

I crack my eyes to see the drab beige ceiling of my bedroom. Panicked, I sit up and look around, my hands still buzzing from the recoil of the gun. Everything seems to be normal except...high on a bookshelf sits a hunched over Arty Smartypants puppet, regular-sized. I jump up to reach for it and take it down by the hand - thankfully it's made of plastic, not human flesh.

I go to the kitchen table and ask my mom where this came from. "You've always had it, what's wrong with you? The things we buy you aren't good enough? I remember you cried and cried, begging me and causing an extremely embarrassing scene at the store until I bought it for you. And now you complain?"

I explain to her that I would never want something like this, that the character has creeped me out since I was little. She shoos me away and sticks to her story, getting angrier and angrier. Finally, I give up and exclaim I'll just deal with it in therapy. "Therapy?" she says. "Ha. You don't have a therapist. You have problems, but you're not crazy. I am not taking my son to one of them. Not now, not ever." I stare at her, dumbfounded. \*Blink.\* Arty is right against my face, holding my cheeks with his human hands and wooden limbs, shaking side to side and laughing. \*Blink.\* I am back in the kitchen. Now my mom is laughing. "Therapy - haha - ridiculous. Not for this family."
