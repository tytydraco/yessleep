Gaslighting people… What a beautiful thought.

Gaslighting is so much more than you know. Mention Gaslighting and it elicits so many different emotions and I believe that intentional. I’ve never heard a Gaslighter tell anyone how they Gaslight them and I think that is because they want to keep the technology a secret and it is a technology. They have to keep the lie going, they have to keep the smokescreen going. 

Gaslighting isn’t this bad thing that people make out, this bad thing that people shouldn’t look into, this bad thing that should be kept hidden. Gaslighting technology has been used for tens of thousands of years to bring people together and pull them apart. 

Gaslighting is a skill “the billions” should use, every day. Now just because I said “the billions” should use Gaslighting, does not mean they ever will. Even if I told “the billions” about how I and many others Gaslight them every day, most would do everything they could not to deal with it because you see, "the billions" are also Gaslighters, they just won't admit it.

Now I should qualify what I mean by “the billions”:

“The billions” are the billions of people out there, reasoning their lives away, wasting their days on things of no consequence to them, those around them or to humanity itself, wondering why their world is the way it is. The billions have found a way to leverage the flaws of themselves and humanity to convince themselves and humanity that never living the life of their dreams, never thinking their own thoughts, never being free, is the way to live life.

I call “the billions”, Amateur Gaslighters, people with skill, who waste their lives, Gaslighting each other, making each other as helpless and as hopeless as themselves and being right about it. Trapped inside a reality that does not exist, fighting to keep it alive.

I’ve run into several thousand Amateur Gaslighters in my time, I’ve even run into a few people diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder. Now those people have got some serious Gaslighting skills. The real good ones, those motherfuckers are scary, you can watch them change someone's reality right in front of your eyes. It’s them that I learned Gaslighting from and all I have to say right now about that is, fuck me, don’t try that at home. There were years when I wasn’t sure my mind would survive and when I finally got away, there were professionals who thought I would never recover.

You know what's interesting: people only complain about Gaslighting technology being used on them if it creates a negative outcome. I bet you never thought you could use Gaslighting for good?

You know what is even more interesting? 

Answer this question: What isn’t Gaslighting? That one took me years to answer.

Ok, so let me get back on track, I’m here to show you the Art of Gaslighting and it is an art. I consider it the most beautiful invention of humanity and I know that is a big call, human beings have invented some beautiful things. It is the most beautiful invention of humanity because it contains the keys to the minds of people, every person you know and will ever know, every person you have seen and will ever see. Gaslighting contains the key to their minds.

Even more than being beautiful, Gaslighting is the most powerful invention humanity has ever created, more powerful than all the nuclear weapons. Why? 

Well…if Gaslighting contains the key to the minds of people, it is the key to human productivity and creation, it is key to the imaginative capacity of all humans. Or put more succinctly, it contains the key to the fabric of human reality. For a Gaslighter can weave reality for others with their words and actions. What is more powerful than the ability to create and weave reality for another, a group or humanity? This world and everything in it exists because human beings say so, so being able to create reality for them is very powerful.

Gaslighting is a challenge for most people to get their head around, which is intentional and complex. It's a bit like how Gaslighting for many people means making someone think they are loosing their minds, it doesn't make sense under any scrutiny. Gaslighting is both incredibly complex and incredibly simple. Unravelling someone's mind so they see it is incredibly challenging, giving them the antidote, snaps them out instantly but many just want to go back, the addiction is too strong.

To really experience and discover Gaslighting the best place to start is Gaslighting children.

Why you might ask? The answer is simple because it’s the most pure form of Gaslighting possible and it is by far the most socially acceptable. Further to this, to become an Expert Gaslighter, someone both free of Gaslighting and able to wield its power, you must always Gaslight from the perspective of Gaslighting a child. Children are a very important key to Gaslighting effectively and without the meat cleaver mess of Amateur Gaslighting.

So let's get onto Gaslighting Children.

It’s a beautiful thought, isn’t it, Gaslighting children…

There is something about the smell of children that is exciting: they smell fresh, clean, unadulterated, like fresh painted white walls or that new car smell. I bet you get excited about fresh painted walls or that new car smell, there is something about the smell of someone or some place that no one else has been to.

Like painting or drawing or singing, the Art of Gaslighting is best done on something blank, for one thing, it's easy to see your mistakes and your successes but the real reason, once you are past your practicing is to see the work of art you have created, a work of art that no one else has put a brush stroke on.

Gaslighting a young child is painting on a blank mind, it is an incredible privilege, it's pure, unadulterated, completely different to Gaslighting adults. Gaslighting adults is like dealing with a dirty canvas, it takes an Expert artist to make a dirty canvas look beautiful.

Have you ever peered into the nothingness of a child's eyes and seen the Being inside? I love the exhilaration it brings me, looking into their eyes, our Beings meet and for a moment I am transported into nothingness - it sends shivers of excitement through me just thinking about it. I’ve done it thousands of times and it never gets old. That helpless Being completely unaware of the faults, flaws and failings of the human that carries it. Completely unaware of how unprepared it is to deal with "the billions" of this world, with their reasons and excuses for why they are the way they are and the world is the way it is.

If you left them long enough, the Being inside would make its mark: make their human and their life, their own. They might get lucky and create greatness but it's unlikely. Not because they don’t want to create greatness but because of “the billions” of people waiting for them to pull them into the fold. The billions they are completely unprepared for. The billions of people out there, reasoning their lives away, wasting their days on things of no consequence, that do not matter to them, those around them or to humanity itself. The billions want this child to become like them, reasoning, complaining, wasting away, caught in a never ending fight to the death over who is right and who is wrong, hoping that something happens and their life is different but knowing they will never get out, that they are trapped and they do not have the strength to escape.

We, I am not going to allow that, I am going to give this child’s life purpose. I am going to paint on this blank canvas. I am going to Gaslight them, I am going to use their human to control the Being. I am going to make the Being think that my thoughts are their thoughts and it will work. It worked billions of times before this and it will continue to work billions of times afterwards. 

How do I know this? How can you know this?

You have experience with Amateur Gaslighting, everyone does, but most people will tell you they don’t Gaslight, which I enjoy - I like to mess with those people. It takes a while to differentiate yourself from the Gaslighting you have experienced and very few people are aware of the extent of it. So far I have hinted to you how you can differentiate yourself from the Gaslighting and the mark it has made on your human and if you have been listening closely and I hope you have, then you will have seen it. If you haven’t i'll go into it for a bit.

Just stop and breath in the quiet, feeling your lungs fill with air and the wind touch your body, watch the world and listen to your thoughts. Keep doing this until you catch the difference between you and everything else going on in your head. You might notice that your head has much more going on than what is happening in reality. Keep breathing until you can be with everything that is going on in your head while noticing the very little that is going on in reality. If you are very fortunate, you might experience you for a millisecond, an incredibly small moment in time where there is nothing going on in your head. People spend decades meditating, to capture a few moments of that silence, a few moments of just them. I can spend hours in complete silence, walking through the masses at the mall or subway, nothing going on in my head at all, just listening, watching and learning. The difference between nothing and noticing reality and nothing and your head doing thousands of other things is the Gaslighting.

How you catch Gaslighting in the moment, as its happening is just as easy and it's just as prevalent. Now there are many ways you could catch people Gaslighting but one of the most obvious and prevalent is opinions. What you are looking for is when someone is making out that their opinions are facts. They are looking for people who agree with their opinions, for others who take on their opinions as facts or others who, wait around the Gaslighter, looking for the weak minded.

Now without my definition of Gaslighting, you won't know where I come from as I describe the Art of Gaslighting. Thinking about it, I wouldn't even call it a definition, I would call it a summary. How I like to summarise Gaslighting is: leveraging the flaws of a human being. There are so many ways to summarise Gaslighting and I find that summary the most complete, the one that gives you access to becoming an Expert Gaslighter and the opportunity to be free of Gaslighting. Every other summary I have read or attempted to create has led to a dead end and I have created and read many hundreds of summaries and definitions of Gaslighting. Why my summary does not lead to a dead end is a mystery to me. It might be the nature of information, of knowing or of Gaslighting that requires a complete summary to be something that both frees you of Gaslighting and allows you to become an Expert Gaslighter, to harness the power of Gaslighting and of yourself.

Anyway, enough of my philosophical conversations about Gaslighting and back to Gaslighting children. Now I like to break Gaslighting down into a science, something repeatable, something that someone can follow along with, something that is accessible. That’s what I am going to do for you because I want more people like you to be Expert Gaslighters, to take on “the billions” and put them to work on useful pursuits, not wasting their lives, dragging themselves down.

Now if Wikipedia is to be believed, human children are between the ages of zero and eighteen. Now I’ve yet to meet a fifteen year old that is anywhere near a blank slate, so different ages present different Gaslighting opportunities, i.e. different flaws to leverage. This is also why Gaslighting children is the best place to start, it gives you a great breadth of flaws to work with and those flaws can be extrapolated to all other humans. My general rule is, the smellier they get, the more adult like the Gaslighting needs to be, whats better is you don’t have to worry about getting caught because Gaslighting children is very socially acceptable.

Now Gaslighting is a game that can be customised for each one of your Gaslightee’s and most Gaslighters focus on just a few people. Some Gaslighters, like those people and organisations with a large number of people in their care like governments, education institutions, global corporations, religious institutions, can leverage the flaws of groups of people. I wouldn’t recommend starting out attempting to leverage the flaws of groups of people but if you wanted to start studying that, I recommend discovering how Hitler got the German people in action, killing millions, who never did a single thing to deserve it or maybe a little less dramatic, how groups of people operate and leaders lead them to do things that don't make much sense.

So let's get onto the flaws that we can leverage. There are quite literally billions of them when it comes to adults and less so as a human being gets younger. Luckily for us, the lesser number of flaws available to leverage when they are children is offset by how large those flaws are and how unaware young children are of their own flaws.

For the youngest of us human beings, what most Amateur Gaslighters do is scare them as early and as often as possible, some even threaten their lives. In the last few years, many online forums have shown up, where children who were brought up by narcissistic parents share their childhood stories. These narcissistic parents knew that fear was incredibly important to the Gaslighting and control of their children. You hear stories of them being threatened, beaten, pinched, frightened, yelled at, any and all behaviours to create fear. See, fear releases cortisol and adrenaline, both addictive substances. Getting levels of cortisol and adrenaline high, as early as possible, well before the child has an ability to remember, sets the child’s normal levels all the way through life. Reducing these levels later in life would be weird to them, they wouldn’t be being them, they would resist it strongly. They do not know they were different once, because they cannot remember it, cortisol and the fight, flight or freeze response dealt with that. This sets the stage for what they call trauma bonding, bonding to you because you are a supply of cortisol and adrenaline and bonding to situations and people who also provide a supply of cortisol and adrenaline. 

Fear is a powerful tool and to teach someone to disregard their fears creates the foundation on which all other Gaslighting sits. You see fear and their not doing anything in the face of it, has them question themselves, their reality and their ability to trust their predictions of reality. Once you have destabilised their foundations, nothing they put on top will ever be strong. they create things to protect themselves with reasons, excuses, thoughts and feelings becoming their drug of choice. Their fear creates new flaws and they use these thoughts, feelings, reasons and excuses to plug the holes in their sinking ship but it never seems to stop sinking because the flaws keep growing… Their brain chemicals are pumping adrenaline and cortisol into their bodies at forever increasing rates because like any drug, you always need more of it. Next thing, they have anxiety or they are unable to regulate their attention, which is even better, because now their body and their mind is regulated by something outside of themselves.

Can you see the beauty of it? Can you see past your opinions of someone who would intentionally do that? When you can, you will see its beauty like me, you will see the power of Gaslighting. That's what I want you to see, to see past your small view of Gaslighting and see its power, its opportunity, its freedom.

Let’s look at a couple of flaws of late teenagers, (which can be extrapolated to adults) there are two very obvious flaws: the need to be right, which they take into adulthood and will be useful to remember for our later conversations about Gaslighting adults and they are horny as hell. If you knew a particularly talented teenager and wanted to limit their choices in life significantly, it would be smart to encourage the opportunity of sexual promiscuity, which will often lead to teenage pregnancy, maybe even abortion or just getting a reputation for this sort of behaviour, all experiences that elicit unfavourable emotional and memory responses.

The need to be right, which when you look a bit further under the surface is a pathological need to protect themselves. If you look a bit further under the surface, their need to be right is just them defending their opinions, like their opinions and they, are one and the same. You can have a hell of a time Gaslighting someone who thinks that their opinions are real and that their perceptions of reality are in fact true. The fear that is hidden underneath all that protection comes to the surface in a torrent of projection, spraying everywhere. If you can get that fear to stick to something in reality, it will likely stay for life. It could be fear of men, fear of women, fear of intimacy, fear of dogs, fear of the unknown. This might sound similar, maybe you have some friends like this, maybe you are like this. If that is the case, I’ve got good news champ, narcissism has visited your little neck of the woods but that is definitely a story for another day.

You might be a chip off the old block these days, just like your parents, grandparents or friends but back then before the fear, you were just you, nothing but a Being, using everything your human offered, full of excitement for life, you could have been anything and things programmed you this way. It might be hard to remember behind all the programming but you were you once, and nothing else. All you need to do is look into the eyes of a baby and wait for your Beings to connect.

It is very easy to see where I am going here, Gaslighting people isn’t complex and the results will often last a lifetime. We walk around and we can see the flaws of everyone around us but they can rarely see them. Most people protect their traumatic experiences, the experiences that had the most impact on their lives. They never want to deal with them again, which means the fear stays inside them, ready for you or any other Gaslighter to come along and leverage it. You will also have trained these children to Gaslight as they get into their school years and adulthood, to pass on, what I call Amatuer Gaslighting.

I could stop right now and you would have a really great view of the Art of Gaslighting, I would have done my job but I want to take it a step further. Before we do that I want you to take a moment and let that all sink in. 

So let's say you have fully processed all of what I just said: you’ve spent the time practising Gaslighting, you have spent the time getting interested in the flaws of others and you are somewhat free of the Gaslighting of others. You can wield Gaslighting as a tool not as a reaction. I want to give you a glimpse into where you could go from here.

One of the flaws we humans have is our ability to reprogram ourselves, it is also one of our biggest strengths. What comes with this flaw is the ability to question ourselves, to create gaps in who we have created ourselves to be, to add or subtract information. This ability to question ourselves is the flaw that most Amateur Gaslighters leverage and it works every time and on every human if you are subtle enough. Being subtle is about feeling the flaws, like ripples in space time echoing out. For me it takes breathing, sometimes closing my eyes, but most of all blanking my mind. 

When I do this, I can see the fabric of human reality, that reality that does not exist but which everyone interacts with. How I did this is that I have removed everything that isn’t me, everything that isn’t my thoughts, the ones I would intentionally have. Sure, I still get thoughts that are not mine, but I snap off that neural pathway and move forward or I let them float away into the ether. If I get my head really quiet, I can literally hear the Being inside another person’s head, scratching at the walls, trying to get free of the neural pathways that keep them trapped.

I’ve even developed the ability to talk straight through their walls, like walking through the bars of a prison and sitting down with them. Sometimes the Being is asleep and has been for a long time, sometimes they are awake and cannot work out how you got past their defences, rarely are they pleased you woke them up. They thought they outsmarted the world by creating those bars and living behind them, protected and here I am sitting with them, head cocked to the side, looking at them.

The great thing about what I just said is that you can take it or leave it. You don't have to believe me. You can go back to your life, back to being an Amateur Gaslighter, pulling the fabric of human reality over you, hiding behind your reasons and excuses, convincing others to do the same.

Either way, I win.
