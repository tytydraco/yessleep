I  grew up hearing the same old legends as you did.

Salem. Medieval England. Innocent women drowned and burned at the stake in the name of rabid religion. My dad was a huge history geek and used to show me the witch's marks in the cottages we stayed in when we traveled around Scotland; they were strange symbols- sometimes prayers -etched into the walls or over the doors in a supposed attempt to lock out the forces of evil.

Last summer, I went with friends to a camp in New England. It's taken me this long to say anything about it because I'm still not sure what happened. I'm still not sure I'm not just insane. But yesterday, when I saw the reports of the missing family...

I knew I had to say something. The trouble with ghost stories is that they always tell you there's some way to protect yourself- some symbol to draw or prayer to say or handsome exorcist to call on. There isn't. There is only warning.

The camp was set up at the edge of the black lake, seemingly bottomless, and we knew its history going in. Liam grew around there, said the kids used to call it "Witch Lake" and sing garish songs about "Break Neck Sally." We laughed about this in the car ride up as we passed around the Google Docs itinerary and a blunt- or most of us did. Hanna only chewed the bottom of her lip and watched the trees race by in a grey blur.

I tell you, it looked like any other woodland tourist camp in Connecticut when we got there. I wish I could say there was a sign or a feeling or an obviously sinister vibe, but the first thing I noticed was the colorful map display and the bulletin board advertising free face-painting for children under twelve.

We stayed in Cabin 23, and that was where we first saw it. Stooping under the low doorway, we filed in and sauntered around to look. The floors were old wood and scuffed with decades upon decades of us. The fireplace was stone made nearly black by soot. The furniture was startlingly modern. On the back wall was a plaque discussing how Cabins 1 - 29 had been build as part of a fur-trading camp in the early days of the colonies, then swiftly abandoned after eleven months due to what has only been recorded as "blight."

As I made a slow turn around the room, my eyes caught on a line of symbols, etched deeply into the wood over the window, and I jumped.

"Holy shit," I muttered.

John came up behind me and squinted at them; they were smudged with black at the edges, like they'd been burned in. "What is it?" he asked.

Normally, we'd be asking *him.* John was a classics major with several minors in all kinds of eclectic nonsense- at least one of them was in linguistics. Liam, his roommate since freshman year, called him "Indy" after Indiana Jones.

"They're witch's marks," I said, running my finger over the jagged lines and whirls. I was pleased to know something that John didn't. "People used to put them over the entrances to their houses to keep witches out."

 Hanna made a squeaking noise in the back of her throat.

John laughed and turned to wink at her. "C'mon now," he chided me. "Don't scare her."

"I'm serious!" I said, but my mouth quirked up in a barely-suppressed smile. Hanna was too easy. "My dad used to drag me around to look at them when we'd go visit my grandpa- they're *all over* Scotland."

"There's one above the door too," Liam quipped, leaning over the back of the couch with his arms folded next to Hanna. "It makes sense. They would need those here to keep out Break Neck Sally."

We all laughed except Hanna and threw our bags down in whatever corner or surface we could find before heading out to explore the lake. There was still an hour or two of daylight left, and we wanted to take advantage.

"Why do they call her that?" I asked Liam as we fallowed the trail back to the lake. "Break Neck Sally?"

He shrugged. "My brother always told me it was one of the wives of the fur traders," he said. "Back when it was a camp- the 1600s or something. Apparently they thought she was a witch so they hung her from a tree by the lake and she broke her neck, but kept blinking at them, and smiled. They were so freaked out they buried her under 10 feet of dirt to try and keep her spirit away, and that's when the blight came."

"She poisoned the ground," Hanna said in a knowing voice, drawing her arms tight around her.

"She didn't exist," John snorted.

I tossed my head back and forth as we came up to the lake and the row of kayaks set out on the shore. "I'm sure she did," I said, "but the poor girl was probably just, like, literate or something. You know they'd kill a woman for anything back then...we weren't even supposed to speak."

"The good old days," Liam said with a dramatic sigh.

I smacked him on the back of the head. 

We spoke no more of Break Neck Sally or her blight. Instead we jumped into kayaks and splashed each other, racing to the pitch black center of the lake as Liam and John called out increasingly ridiculous dares to each other. Even Hanna seemed to have forgotten to be afraid, and my cheeks began to hurt from smiling, but I couldn't help but notice the gnarled and solitary oak as we passed it. It was stooped down like it was leaning over the bank, and one particularly thick branch jutted out far above the water. I told myself that the divot cut into it, widened with time, could not possible have been from a rope.

It was dark by the time we trudged back to Cabin 23, tired and soaking wet from the lake. Mosquitoes gnawed at our bare arms and ankles, and I was so consumed with itching myself that at first I didn't notice it when we walked in. I nearly crashed into John, who had stopped just a few feet in the door and was frowning at something on the ground.

"What the hell?" he asked in a flat voice.

I followed his gaze and saw that our bags- all four of them -were neatly arranged side by side by side by side along the back of the couch. They were straight, spotless, and zipped up, even though I was certain I'd left mine spilling over at the bottom of the stairs after I dug through it for my polaroid. 

"Did they...did someone go through our *stuff?*" I demanded. "That's, like, seriously messed up."

"They've never done that before when I've been," Liam said.

"Maybe they could smell the weed?" Hanna ventured.

"Oh...Hanna, it wasn't the weed." Liam rolled his eyes and pushed past the rest of us to kneel before his bag and yank the zipper open. Despite what he said to Hanna, the first thing he pulled out was a dime bag of pot. "Besides," he muttered, pulling it open, "it's all perfectly legal. I have a medical card."

He stuck his nose into the bag, then reared back with a horrified expression and coughed. "Argh!" he scowled. "*Bro."*

"What?" John asked. He was crouched before his own bag now, checking to make sure all his belongings were in place. I was too- nothing was missing.

"It *stinks,*" Liam huffed, tossing the bag aside. "Must've got mold or something. C'mon, they probably just sent in the cleaning people and they lined the stuff up for us to sweep the floor or something." He stood up and slapped his knees. "I need a drink."

So when we were changed and less rattled by the disturbance of our bags, we flopped down between the couch and a nest of pillows on the floor and cracked open the beers we'd brought, chatting over the soft lull of some reality show in the television. There was something off about the beer, I remember. Something cloying and sour. We were college kids, though, and had all drank worse.

"Anyway it's not like she *cheated* on her paper or anything," Hanna was saying, wrapped up in a woolen blanket beside me. "If she plagiarized anyone, she plagiarized herself! It's..."

She cut off there, and her face went white. Her gaze was fixed on the window next to the door. "Who is that?" she whispered.

We all turned at once. I felt a spark of annoyance, sure it was just going to be a swaying tree or, at most, a raccoon, but no. It couldn't have been more obvious than this.

A figure stood outside- human, but wrapped tightly in white linen from head to foot, like a mummy. Her arms were free, hanging with tattered scraps of cloth, and her hands were black with dirt. Judging by the shape, she was a woman.

Liam and John slowly stood up from the couch.

"I..." Liam shook his head. "I don't know. Maybe some kind of, freakin...reenactment? To scare people?"

"Well it's messed up," I snapped, pulling Hanna closer to me. "Tell them to get lost."

The boys exchanged a quick glance, and John tipped his glasses back on his nose with an uneasy frown. 

Swallowing, Liam nodded and shuffled up to the window to tap on the glass. "Alright, man!" he called. "You got us. Go on to the next one, huh? Our friend doesn't like this kinda stuff."

The woman stayed motionless. 

"Just go away!" I yelled. "We didn't sign up for any kind of scary experience or anything; we're just trying to watch tv."

Nothing. She stood a few feet from the cabin, arms slightly apart from her body and moving softly with each breath. 

"Listen," Liam said, "I don't want to have to call the front desk..."

She moved so fast I'm not sure any of us saw it- we just heard the 'crack' like a dry log breaking and were left gaping at her, now only inches from the window, with her head bent to the right at a 90 degree angle.

"Jesus!" Liam yelped, springing backwards.

Hanna began to whimper. 

"Alright, alright!" I fought to keep the panic from my voice. "Liam call the front desk. Tell them some...*asshole,*" I rose my voice at that part, hoping she could hear me, "is messing with us outside our cabin."

Liam fumbled his phone from his pocket, and I saw his fingers trembling slightly as they worked to dial in the number.

She began to move. Her legs were too long, and bent strangely as she walked like the broken limbs of a puppet. At first I thought she was retreating, cowed by the threats to call the front, but then I saw her ghostly form slip past the window through the kitchen, head still bent and staring in at us even as her body went forward. Then she appeared in the back window, then by the door again. She was circling the house.

"I wanna go home," Hanna whispered. Tears were streaming down her face. "This isn't funny..."

"I know, I know." I tried to turn in time with her, to predict when she'd pass through the window, but each time she surprised me. She was saying something now, muffled by the cloth over her mouth and garbled in the trappings of some language other than English. It had a monotone, chanting quality to it, and sent shivers down my back though I didn't know a word she was saying. He voice sounded like breaking glass.

"Damn it!" Liam cursed, running a hand through his hair. "The front desk isn't picking up- it won't even go to voicemail. Just keeps ringing."

"John, what's she saying?" I asked, tugging on his sleeve. I had pushed Hanna back so she was half behind me; I'm not sure what I thought that would do. Maybe if I could just keep her from seeing...but she watched the woman more than any of us, eyes wide with terror.

"It's..." John shook his head. "I think she's speaking French, but it's old, like..."

"Like 1600s?" Liam asked.

"Liam, shut *up,*" I snapped, glaring at him. "This isn't the time."

"Well I'm just saying maybe this person is *pretending* to be..."

John was listening now, keyed in to the constant chanting and spinning slowly around the room to keep his ear to the woman. "Something about soup," he muttered. "A soup of your...entrails. The darkness is already inside. God has turned his back and..." he stopped, stock still, in the middle of the room and blanched, his jaw suddenly snapping shut. He was still listening.

One, two, three whole seconds. We watched him hardly breathing.

"Liam," he whispered. "Call 911."

"Wha...? Jesus, man..."

"Call them now!"

"Alright!" Liam pounded the numbers into his phone just as the woman, who had passed by the back window, pounded on the side of the cabin.

Hanna screamed. John turned his head to the side and vomited.

Another bang. The cabin shook, and I could not see where she was but a flash of white blurred at the edge of the window, flapping in the stale summer breeze.

"Call them!" John insisted. 

"I can't, I can't!" Liam shook his head with a frantic look in his eyes. "There's no service!"

There was no time either. The banging had turned into a series of grunts and scratching noises against the back wall, and they got higher and higher up until we found ourselves with our heads tilted back towards the ceiling. Faintly, through the second floor above us, we heard shuffling footsteps.

"My god," Liam breathed. "Is she on the roof?"

She let out a feral howl. It was unlike any animal I'd ever heard, but it wasn't human either. All of us were screaming by then, and though Liam had been telling the truth, we all tried to dial 911 for ourselves. No avail. It rang and rang and rang.

The footsteps quickened. The ceiling shook and she sounded like she was somehow getting closer, but I couldn't think how. I didn't see her out of any of the windows and the stairs were clear, and the only thing on the roof was...

We all locked eyes on it once. The fireplace. She was coming through the chimney.

It happened so fast. First, I think the tv went out. I don't know why that stands out so clearly in my head but the host of the reality show had been mid-sentence, talking about "today's challenge is..." and then he was cut off, and the room went dark as the lights cut only seconds later. We all bolted towards the front door blindly, and then Hanna screamed.

She screamed louder than the rest of us. The only thing I could hear beyond her terror was that deep muttering French.

"Hanna!" I scrambled through the dark for her. In the moonlight that came in through the windows, I could see an arm reaching out from the fireplace, too-long fingers wrapped around Hanna's wrist and dragging her in. She was sobbing so hard she was making herself retch. 

I grabbed her, trying to pull her back out, but all it did was move me along with her, even when the boys came and locked their arms around me. We were all getting pulled into the fireplace, and Hanna, save for the bit of her sleeve that I was clutching, was disappearing up the chimney.

"Help me!" she shrieked.

"Ruth, let go!" Liam yelled to me.

"We have to help her!" I cried.

"You're hurting her! Her arm! Let go!"

He was right- I was keeping her arm out at a dangerous angle while the rest of her body moved up, but I couldn't bring myself to let go. In the end, it was John who ripped me away from her and practically carried me out of the cabin. We could hear her screams for half a mile through the woods.

The administration's building was one mile out, on the other side of the lake. None of us said a single word to each other as we ran towards it, along the family-friendly and well-lit trails with the mosquitoes still trying to get a taste of us. I was crying. Liam was shaking. John still had vomit on his chin.

They said they hadn't gotten any calls from Liam. After desperately trying to calm us down enough to get an sensible story out of us, they must have gathered enough to realize that *something* had petrified us and they called the police. At my insistence, they didn't wait for them to arrive to send security out on a golf cart to check Cabin 23 and try to find Hanna.

Nothing.

And the police: nothing.

They took statements from us and asked us if we had been drinking. The sour beer had done us no favors. John, eve the voice of reason, stressed that whatever we thought we saw, the important thing was that our friend was missing. They had to find her.

They did find her, but not until early the next morning after the police listened to our story three times and the paramedics had to give me and Liam both Xanax to calm us. Hanna was found huddled at the base of the huge oak by the lake, naked and covered in dirt and scratches, inconsolable. She would not say what happened to her, just kept muttering, "the darkness is already inside."

"It looks like a psychotic break," one of the EMTs told me gently as they put her in the ambulance. "You sure you kids didn't take anything?"

In the coming days, we repeated our story countless times, no matter how much people told us it was ridiculous or accused us of an elaborate hoax. To their credit, the police combed the place over. The whole campsite was evacuated and they tested the roof of the cabin for footprints, the windows and walls for prints, and yes, even the fireplace. They went through everything, and all they came up with was the weed and the beer.

"Ergot," the investigator explained to us, and our parents, and Hanna's parents, after a week or so had gone by. He laid a bunch of photos out that neither me nor Liam nor John took one look at. They meant nothing. "It's a type of fungus that can cause strange behavior, convulsions...even hallucinations. We found it all over the marijuana you guys brought and in the beer too. Somebody's cooler must have been contaminated."

Liam shook his head, eyes distant. "I brought the weed and John brought the beer," he muttered. "They weren't in the same cooler."

The investigator shrugged, nonplussed. "It's the only thing we've found that explains anything," he said. "Ergot, it's almost like very potent LSD. If it was in the stuff you were drinking, you all essentially had one hell of a bad trip."

"The same bad trip?" John confirmed with a raised eyebrow.

"It's famous for this, trust me," the investigator insisted. "Been around for centuries- it used to cause big blights on grain and stuff and make everyone around go crazy."

I felt my mouth go dry. "Blights?"

"Yeah," he nodded at me, seeming pleased that I was catching on. "But you all are probably fine now, the doctors say. It doesn't stick around in the system. Your friend..." his face turned a bit nervous and he glanced at Hanna's silent parents, "she had a worse go of it. Some people's minds just can't handle that. Hopefully they get her all straightened out soon."

Many thanks. Shaking hands. Our parents talked and talked, but none of us listened. We wanted to visit Hanna. They said she wasn't up for visitors. 

Since that last summer, Hanna has not been released from the psych ward. She has not been up for visitors either. John crashed his car into an oncoming train, died on impact. No one said it was on purpose; they didn't have to. Liam went dark. He dropped out of school, deleted all his social media accounts and blocked my number and I haven't heard from him since.

I ran away. I told my dad I wanted to live in Scotland, with my grandpa, and on rainy afternoons when it wasn't fit to wander the highlands, I sat in his warm living room and stared at the witch's marks over the door, wondering if they were just as useless as the other ones.
