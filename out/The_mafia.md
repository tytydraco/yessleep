What I’m about to tell you, completely change my entire life, and I don’t think I will ever be the same again. Some things to keep in mind are that my family lives in a very very wealthy neighborhood, and we all live on a private neighborhood water, and electric grid. We have our own trash team, lawn care, maid service, and security team. All the residents in our neighborhood including my family are not from the United States, and all of us are either Jewish or catholic. With that being said I will begin my story.

It was late one night, and my sister and I where sitting on our swings outside of our house by the woods. We were talking about a number of things, and eventually we got to a favorite topic of us and the other few children in the neighborhood, the mafia. It was rumored that the couple who lived across the street from my family where somehow connected to a strange group of people who often gathered at a large house near my neighborhood and acted as the police to pull over passing people and do god knows what to them. 

Keep in mind that my neighborhood is in the country, so there where many strange, large homes, however this house was like no other. It has bars on the windows, and had black out shades pulled down so no one could ever see into the house. Us kids would spend afternoons gazing out the back gate of our neighborhood down the street, hoping to see the infamous black trucks speeding down the road preparing for a hunt. In winters we would pile up snow to get over the walls on to the back road to try and walk to the house to catch a glimpse of the mafia, but we never got that far. 

The Christmas and midsummer balls where filled with children’s stories of the horrible people who lurked just outside our neighborhood walls. It was late fall the night my sister and I really started to think about it. We where around 14 and 13, and had begged our parents to finally allow us to go to a public school near our house instead of the group homeschool in the neighborhood. Our parents finally allowed it, and with that we had caught a glimpse at what life was like for others. It led us to wonder, why our neighborhood was the secure place it was, and why we had everything in a private separate grid. 

We began to think about each houses high tech security systems, and the license plates of the luxury cars that all started with RVX. Suddenly we began to wonder about how our neighbors and parents where all friends with the local and state government, Or how they all where foreign, and of the Jewish or catholic faith. This was all very strange to us, however the weirdest thing of all was our parents and their friends fortunes. The people in our neighborhood owned many companies, however never did any sort of work at them. 

Our parents had several million dollars however many of our companies where not profitable. We began to wonder if somehow the entire neighborhood was connected, and perhaps our neighbors across the street where not the only members. What if our parents, and our friends parents where all somehow involved. Suddenly the mood shifted. My sister looked at me, her face stricken with fear, and she said to me with a quavering voice, that still haunts my dreams, “run as fast as you can.” 

We flew across our yard, however a 40 second sprint felt like an eternity. We dashed into our home. My sister with tears in her eyes said, “someone was I. The woods. I could see their eyes staring at us. I could feel that they where dangerous.” We stayed in our media room together for almost 2 hours until the feeling we where being watched drifted away. Finally we went to our rooms, mine on the western wing, hers on the upper west. It was only an hour before once again, I felt the tingle of being watched. 

I knew the spy was outside my window. I knew they where watching, waiting. I prayed for sleep to come, and finally it did. I still remember this night very well. It proves to me that somehow, my family is involved with whoever those people are. Whoever my parents and neighbors are, they are far to powerful to challenge. Whoever was watching us, was one of their spy’s. I feel it in my bones. The police can do nothing, because it’s likely that my neighborhood has infiltrated both local and state governments. Something very strange is going on here. 

Money flows like an infinite river for the families in my neighborhood, somehow we all come from the same few places and religions and speak the same 3 languages. I don’t know who these people are, or how many are involved. Many people mysteriously disappear in the area around my neighborhood, and I can’t help but wonder if it’s them. What are they doing, who are they, and how powerful are they. In the years that have followed the incident, my sister and I have said nothing of the mafia since, and often tell the children to stop when they talk about it at the balls, or play mafia games in the yard. 

Whoever my praents and neighbors are, they are doing something very evil. That much I am sure of.
