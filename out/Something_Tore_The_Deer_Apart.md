I wanted to mention my last few days at the convenience store. I’ll admit working at the store was always weird. Old men weird, not scary story weird, but whatever happened those last couple of days was nothing like anything I had ever seen. Not many people in town talk about it, so if you’re one of the younger people living there, you probably have never heard about it. The morning before my shift I was eating breakfast with my family when every dog on the street started to go crazy, like barking nonstop.

“What the hell is wrong with these dogs?” My dad snipped.

I swear he became increasingly cynical through the years.

“I don’t know, just glad we don’t have to deal with one,”  My mom said. 

“Yeah well, it’s still getting on my nerves.” He said. 

“You just get back to making us pancakes, you old man.” my mom poked.

“You’re old two.” My dad whispered through laughs. 

“Excuse me?” I said, raising a brow.

“You two know what I mean.” He smiled. 

“At least I pull it off.” My mom said, crossing her arms with a smirk creeping on her face.

He looked at us before pointing a wooden spatula at us. “You two look too much alike.” He said. “I think I might need to take you both out.” He held the spatula up like a gun. 

My mom shooed him off and he sheepishly retreated back to the kitchen. My mom and I watched some TV show while she started a new puzzle she bought. During breakfast, my dad mentioned he was going to my grandma's house for the evening, I told him to tell her Hi for me, and I left to pick up Markus for work.

Hours later Markus and I were cleaning through papers and outdated products that had been shoved inside the drawers, well really it was just me doing it while Markus sat on his phone in the back, but I was cleaning when my dad rushed into the store. He seemed worried, his face was all sweaty and he was all jittery.

“You ok, dad?” I asked halfway convinced he was having a stroke.

“I was just driving from your grandma's, and.” He paused. “I don’t know how to explain it, something’s out there.” 

“What do you mean something’s out there, like a bear?”

“This wasn't a bear, it was something else… a bear couldn't do that.” He stopped as Markus walked out. “You guys call me when your shift is over, I don't want you guys driving alone.” 

“We can’t just leave my car he-” 

“God dammit, I’ll hook your car to the truck, you’re not driving out there.” He said, cutting me off angrily. 

I looked at him, shocked. My dad never yells, what could he have seen to make him so upset? I nodded my head and my dad left. I looked back at Markus, and a nervous smile crept up on his face. 

“I’m sorry,” I said. 

“No, you’re fine.” He looked at me before a worried expression washed over him.

“What is it?” I asked

“Nothing just freaks me out a bit. I’ve never seen your dad like that” he said seriously.

“Yeah me neither.” I looked at the doors but only saw my dark reflection in the glass. 

After work, we locked up the store and walked into the cold night. I took in the breeze a bit before I called my dad. He picked up within seconds. He told me he’d be there in ten, then hung up. I put my phone in my pocket and threw on my jacket. I looked up at the sky. I was tranced by the stars but I was quickly ripped from my spell.

“Do you think if I blew up the school they would know it was me?”

“What?” I said laughing a bit

He shrugged. “Asking for a friend. Hey you ever-...”. He stopped and squinted his eyes before leaning over to look behind me.

I whipped my head around to face the woods. Something was moving in the bushes across the road. I squinted my eyes as well, but it was useless. I couldn't see a thing. I stepped back a little, worried about what was hidden in the darkness just feet ahead of us. I heard the rustling get closer and closer until a little raccoon popped from between the trees. I sighed in relief and laughed at myself for worrying I turned to Markus who smiled at me before laughing at me too. 

It scurried across the road, to hide under the trashcan to my right. A few minutes of silence before my dad pulled up, filling the dark woods around us with light. He parked behind my car and hooked mine to his. We thanked him for the ride, but he stayed silent. While we were driving home, my dad turned up the radio. 

“You ok?” I asked. 

“Yeah, of course, kiddo. Don’t worry about me.” He said, keeping his eyes on the road.

I turned around seeing Markus who was already sleeping in the back seat. A couple of minutes went by until we passed two police cars parked along the side of the road. The cars were running, but I didn’t see anybody. I looked at my dad to see if he noticed the lack of people, but he just looked straight ahead, focused on the winding roads. I looked out my window then something caught my eye. A dark ooze seeped from the bark of the trees. I followed the trail up the tree, something was hanging from a branch, it looked like a flag or a torn piece of clothing, My face scrunched up a little.

“What’s those flags on the trees?” I asked 

“It’s nothing, stop looking, just go to sleep.” My dad said defensively.

 I wanted to argue, but I was exhausted. I laid my head on the window. The glass was cold against my skin, and I started to drift to sleep. I was listening to the radio when my dad slammed on the brakes.  I jolted forward and sat up quickly.

“What, what happened?”  Markus asked, leaning between the front seats. 

“It’s just a dear.” My dad said. I looked ahead of us. It was standing dead center of the lane, facing away from us. My dad honked to get it to move, but nothing it just stood there slightly swaying, staring into the darkness ahead. 

“What’s wrong with it?” Markus said, almost in a whisper.

My dad flashed his headlights and it slowly turned to us, it looked like it was losing its balance with every little movement. Its hair was stained red, and I could hear it call to us quietly. I clasped my hands over my mouth, half its face was hanging from its bones. Its eyes filled with Pain. It stepped forward and all the contents of its stomach splattered onto the road before the deer itself collapsed. 

My dad rushingly threw open the door and puked, Markus swore in horror, and I couldn't look away from it. My dad was yelling something, but I don’t remember what. The deer yelled and screamed in pain Markus put his hands to his ears, screaming for it to stop, and it did, its voice grew hoarse, and it lost what little energy it had left before laying there in silence. My dad jumped back in the car and sped us home.

I could see Markus’s eyes were wide as the moon, he just stared into the distance. His eyes shifted from one thing to the next. I felt the same. I didn’t know what to think, or how to even address what happened. What could do that do a deer? No bear could do that. When we got home, no one said a thing. We quietly walked upstairs and went to bed. Markus stayed the night in the guest bedroom. After everyone was up for breakfast my mom tried to ask how yesterday went, but it was like talking to a brick wall. I had never seen my dad so upset.

One of the officers who went out into the woods to check out what happened never came back. Lots of people were sent out to look for him, but it was like he disappeared off the face of the earth. Locals found his car, his gun, and his hat, but nothing else was ever recovered. Police later informed us we weren’t allowed to go out of town alone, they also set a hunting ban for a year or two after the incident, but since people went hunting anyway they settled that you couldn't bring anyone under the age of 16 and had to bring at least one other person above the age of 18, or else you would get a big fat fine. I heard they were going up to a thousand dollars at some point.

The next day, Markus got to leave work early, so he and I were doing his nightly chores to help him get out sooner, however, we got distracted and were trying to toss M&M’s into each other's mouths. We heard the bell ring and I looked up to see who walked in. We were in the far corner so all I could see was the top of his head. I listened to his slow and unrhythmic footsteps as he walked to the back and grabbed something before walking to the front. He rang the small bell at the counter and stood there silently waiting, facing the wall. Markus and I looked at each other.

 “I’m not going up,” I whispered. 

“Like the fuck I am.”. 

“Yeah, the fuck you are.” 

“Nah, two outta three.” He said, holding up a fist over his palm. 

After his absolutely devastating loss, I smiled as I shooed him to go up and scan the man out. He walked over, cursing something under his breath. They were talking for a while so I peeked around the corner, Markus seemed irritated so I reluctantly went to intervene. When I got over to the counter I got a good look at the man. He was young, his eyes a dark gray, lips red, hair dark, and cheeks rosy. He gave me a warm smile, a smile like he’d known me for years.

 “Is there something I can help you guys with?”. 

“No, no, sorry uh…”  he bowed his head a little, looking at my name tag “Billie.”. 

Markus groaned. The man shot him a quick look and grabbed his things. “I’ll get going, you have a good night.” He said smiling before walking out. 

“What was that for?” I asked, smacking Markus on the arm. 

“I don’t know, he had like a tone.” 

“A tone?” I said crossing my arms 

“Yeah, like when your mom’s mad at you, but doesn’t wanna say it directly.  I was trying to make small talk but he was just annoyed at me like I did something wrong.” 

“I thought he was nice.”

“Of course, you did, his whole attitude changed when you walked up.” Markus said grudgingly.

I told him to stop being a baby, and we continued working in silence before he left. As soon as he did, it got busy, but that was to be expected with my luck. I think it felt worse because I knew I had to close up alone, but after many dumb customers and agonizing hours, I was checking a woman out when I heard the bell at the top of the door ring. I looked up to see a man (no older than 30 ) with a winter coat on. He didn’t say anything or even look my way. I asked him if he needed help with anything, but he ignored me. I looked at the woman who gave him a side eye and then looked back at me concerned. She offered to stay until he was gone, but I assured her it was fine, and she hesitantly left.

Eventually, the man walked up to me and started to put his things on the counter. He looked up at me, smiling.“So it’s just you?” he asked, attempting to look nonchalant.

I looked at him. I had been through this a thousand times, it was almost insulting he thought I was this stupid.“No, my coworker is in the back, cleaning the freezer,” I smiled.

He looked at me and nodded.

“Yeah it’s annoying I'm the only one out front, but I’m not the one who has to close later so I guess it’s even. I said laughing. I leaned over to see the young man from earlier. I didn’t even hear him walk in, so it did scare me a little bit.

“I forgot my wallet.” He said. Straight faced. He looked at the man, and then at me. “Sorry, for… interrupting.” he opened his mouth as if to add something but didn’t. The other man turned around disappointed and grudgingly took his things and left.

I looked back at the younger man smiling, “Which one is it”

“It’s black and has a Target gift card for 25 dollars..”

 I bent to search through the small drawer of lost items before finding him. I stood up.

“Elijah?”

He looked up at me confused. “Oh oh yeah sorry.” He said taking his wallet. He smiled a little. 

 “You live nearby?” I asked.

“Oh yeah, near the square. Blue apartment building.” 

“Oh yeah, I know where that is.”

“Yeah, it’s not the nicest, but I make the most of it.” 

A few minutes later we said goodnight and I was left alone again. Nothing but the buzzing of the lights to keep me company. I tried to entertain myself, but ultimately just ended up cleaning more stuff. I was in the back mindlessly sweeping with my headphones blasting whatever song I was into at the time, at full volume. I organized some boxes before I got a bad feeling in my stomach. I turned to the entrance of the room. It was a big room filled with boxes and shelves so the door was blocked from my view, I walked to the front, and as I did I could smell something…burning. I rushed to the door.

I pulled up my sleeve and pressed it against the doorknob. It wasn’t hot so I carefully opened the door, the store was filled with smoke, I coughed, holding back the tears coming to my eyes. I could feel the heat of the fire washing over my face, it was unbearable. I ran to the fire exit and pushed as hard as I could, throwing myself against the door but it wouldn’t open. Panic rushed through me, and I ran to the front door. Someone had used the bolt lock, I was stuck inside. More of the fire started to swell onto the aisle shelves. I rushed to the desk grabbing the fire distinguisher, I looked at the expiration date, 1989. 

“Are you actually fucking kidding me” I shouted aimlessly. 

I grabbed it and ran to the door. I looked up at the glass. “Sorry Markus” was written on it with something. My brain didn’t even have the time to take in what I was seeing, I couldn’t afford to, I could hear the crackling of fire growing louder around me. I slammed the extinguisher against the glass hoping it would break, but I only got a single crack in, I did this at least five more times, and nothing. Sweat poured down my forehead, I broke into a fit of coughs as I tried to breathe, causing me to curl over a little as I held my throat. I ran back to the counter trying to find something. I could barely see, my eyes were stinging so bad I strained myself to keep them open. I found a window breaker shoved into one of the defective product boxes. 

My face lit up and I ran to the door before slamming it against the glass, until it shattered the door. I climbed through the sharp glass opening, breathing heavily as fresh air washed into my lungs. I crawled next to the road and laid down on the pavement. The cool air felt icy against my face. I looked up at the stars and laughed to myself in disbelief. I sat up looking at the store in front of me, smoke spilling out of the broken door and filling the sky. I leaned over and grabbed my phone from my pocket and dialed 911. I told them about the fire and waited.

I lifted my head to see the writing on the glass. This was meant for Markus…but why? I stared at the doors, until the glass eventually exploded from the pressure of the heat, the bright orange fire illuminating the trees. How would he know, why did they think he was supposed to be working, not me? I was mid-thought when I heard it.

“Billie.”

I stood up instantly, looking around me wildly. Minutes went by and I was left in silence, I started to think it was in my imagination, but I knew what I heard, I knew it. I looked around me, searching through each tree trying to find whoever spoke to me, but I couldn’t tell where his voice came from. I gripped the window breaker in my hand tightly. I yelled at him to come out, but he didn’t. I shouted at him, calling him names, and cursing threats, but I was met with silence.

“You’re a fucking monster, I fucking hate you!” I shouted angrily, I could hear my voice echo just slightly.

Although I only heard silence in return I know that man could hear me, I know he did.

I looked up and I saw him. That thin wretched man from so many years ago. He looked at me in silence. His thin figure poked out between the trees. I stood up straight looking at him. He didn’t move an inch. We stood in silence, staring at each other. I took a step forward, and so did he. I looked at him my brows furrowed, he followed my expression. It was like his eyes almost glowed in the dark. I could feel the wind picking up, and I held my arms tight to my chest. I could hear the sirens in the distance and turned around. When I looked back the man was gone.

Police and firefighters arrived seconds later, they insisted it was just a gas leak. The store was obviously shut down, and Markus and I were left without work for months. Eventually, I  started working at a coffee shop in town, where lots of people were. Turns out Elijah was a regular, which made sense, his place was only a few minutes away. I told Markus about the message on the glass, but like every other time, he ended up acting like everything was fine. I told the police about the man, how he’d been following me. Not much came of it though. I should’ve known, with my luck.
