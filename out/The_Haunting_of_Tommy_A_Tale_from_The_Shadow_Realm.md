Tommy was an avid reader of horror novels. He loved the thrill of being scared, the rush of adrenaline that came with every turn of the page. So when he found a particularly creepy book at the library, he couldn't resist checking it out.

The book was called "The Shadow Realm," and it was about a group of teenagers who stumbled upon a mysterious portal to another dimension. As Tommy read the first few chapters, he found himself drawn into the story. The characters were well-written, the plot was intriguing, and the descriptions of the shadowy realm were chilling.

But as he reached the middle of the book, Tommy began to feel a strange sense of déjà vu. The descriptions of the characters and locations were so vivid, it was as if he had been there before. He brushed it off as a coincidence and continued reading.

Then, as he turned the page, he saw his own name: "Tommy was the first to step through the portal..." He froze, his heart racing. He read on, his eyes widening in horror as he realized that he was a character in the book.

As he read further, he discovered that his character was in grave danger. The other characters were plotting against him, trying to use him as a sacrifice to appease the dark forces that ruled the shadow realm. Tommy tried to put the book down, but it seemed to have a strange hold on him. He couldn't stop reading.

The whispering in his ear grew louder and more persistent, until it was almost a shout. He turned around, but there was no one there. The whispering continued, urging him to run, to hide, to do something before it was too late.

With a sudden burst of courage, Tommy decided to take matters into his own hands. He closed his eyes and concentrated hard, trying to will himself out of the book. To his surprise, he felt a strange sensation, as if he was being pulled through a tunnel. He opened his eyes to find himself standing in the middle of the shadow realm.

The air was thick with mist, and the ground was slippery with moss. He could hear strange noises all around him, whispers and moans and screams. He tried to move, but his feet wouldn't obey him. It was as if he was trapped in a nightmare.

Suddenly, he heard a rustling in the bushes. He turned and saw a group of dark figures emerging from the mist. They were the characters from the book, and they were coming for him.

Tommy tried to run, but his legs were like jelly. He stumbled and fell, scraping his knees on the rough ground. He could hear the figures getting closer and closer, their voices growing louder and more menacing.

Just when he thought it was all over, he felt a sudden jolt, as if he was being pulled back through the tunnel. He opened his eyes to find himself back in his bedroom, the book lying open on his lap.

He sat there for a long time, catching his breath and trying to make sense of what had just happened. He knew that he had to finish the book, to find out what happened to his character, but he was too scared to open it again.

In the end, he decided to return the book to the library and never read another horror novel again. But he knew that the memory of the shadow realm would stay with him forever, haunting his dreams and reminding him of the dangers that lurked in the shadows.
