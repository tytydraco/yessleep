[\[Part 13\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1hi4k7j/the_call_of_the_breach_part_13/)

By the time we reached the yawning maw of the southern gate, the fighting had moved further north, the checkpoint manned by men with green uniforms, not gray. What remained of the steel gates were twisted shreds of fire-blackened scrap, the concrete archway pulverized, with one of the two guard towers on either side of the entrance crumpled to rubble. Our men waved as we passed, and for the first time in my life, I drove into Black Oak on my own free will.

Buildings were still on fire throughout the southern district, and we had to slow to avoid obstacles in the road. Burning stacks of tires, wrecked ELSAR vehicles, destroyed civilian cars, all of it made the streets of Black Oak a maze. As we went, I found myself shocked to see more and more people emerge from the surrounding buildings, first a trickle, then a flood. Our fighters had passed through here not minutes ago, and yet as soon as the bullets stopped flying, it seemed people sprouted from everywhere like daisies. They lined the sidewalk in timid ranks, watching us pass with uncertain wonder on their thin faces. I could see the signs of starvation in all of them, even the fattest of the civilians much-deflated by modern standards, and the majority of the children were skin-and-bones. In that spirit, I noted the complete lack of animals, no dogs, cats, or even squirrels to be seen anywhere, no clusters of pigeons atop what houses remained. They’d eaten everything, anything they could get their hands on, and it hadn’t been enough. The way they stood off to the side, hesitant, with a subtle fear in their expressions like a dog that’s been kicked too many times to be friendly, made my chest tighten.

A young woman caught my eye on the edge of the street, her face sunken, wrapped in a ragged blue coat that didn’t look all that warm. She held a bundle of rags in her arms and rocked it gently as she eyed the defensive spikes on our trucks. With how hollowed out her face was, she almost looked to be in her forties, but something about the dull gray eyes when they met mine told me this girl couldn’t be much older than myself.

*Imagine trying to raise your baby in a place like this.*

“Stop for a sec.” I called to Charlie and grabbed my knapsack.

Rolling down my window, I swung the armored strips up on their hinged frame and held out an MRE to the girl. “Here.”

Her eyes went wide as saucers, and she snatched the ration from my hands with a breathless cry.

“Thank you.” She hugged it almost as close as she did her infant, tears streaming down her gaunt face, and the girl took off in a run down the street.

More people moved in, and the others in my platoon began to hand out what food we had with us, many of our ranks former Black Oak citizens themselves. Smiles flashed across the faces of the crowd, and like a switch had been flipped, the entire atmosphere changed.

An old man brought out a tattered American flag from his house, and proudly saluted us as we rolled by. Two women burst from a nearby boutique shop with an armload of faux plastic bouquets which they used to decorate our trucks, and they reached through our windows to hug us with sobs of joy. The crowd mobbed our convoy with jubilant cheers, boys and girls climbed onto the spikes like the rungs of a ladder to wave at their friends in the crowd, and more red, white, and blue flags popped up everywhere. There weren’t any cell phones left for anyone to use, but I saw a few cameras similar to my own come out of hiding so people could capture the moment. They hugged each other, danced and sang, the exuberant relief like static electricity in the air. For them, a long, bloody nightmare was finally over.

Not all stopped to celebrate, of course. While most smiled as we passed, a few looked on with confusion, frowns, or even weeping at the destruction of their neighborhoods. Only a handful dared to shout insults, and these were chased down by others in the crowd who beat them without mercy, in a violent display of the pent-up rage the citizens of this town felt. A crew of civilian men got to work and started a bucket line to dump water from a working hydrant on some of the burning houses, while others cleared rubble away from a collapsed apartment building by hand. Many families seemed to take the open gates as their chance to escape, and a long line of refugees developed within fifteen minutes of our arrival, carrying what little they had on carts, wheelbarrows, childrens’ wagons, and bicycles. They streamed out the southern gate past our flabbergasted checkpoint guards, and into the exterior neighborhoods in droves, willing to brave the terrible unknown of the countryside rather than starve within the ‘safety’ of Black Oak.

“This is crazy.” I muttered under my breath, somewhat frustrated at myself for handing out the first ration that had started this mess.

*Tap, tap, tap.*

I looked up to see a younger boy, about eleven years old in appearance, with a pitted shotgun slung over his shoulder that was nearly as long as he was tall.

He saluted and pointed back to the captured enemy Humvees at the rear of our little convoy. “Josh told me to tell you he knows a way around these people. Take the next right, and then left at the old building with the bakery sign. That’s a back street the Organs never used because they were afraid we would ambush them.”

Doing as he instructed, we wove through a tangle of narrow alleyways, rolled over a few heaps of garbage, and finally came out the other side on a clear street. The drive deeper into town went quicker thanks to our guides, and soon I saw a green and white coalition flag flying over a squat, rectangular brick building.

The elementary school had taken quite a beating, the brickwork marred by bullets, the roof partially caved in at a few places, but the resistance had set up a primitive aid station of their own by the time I strode through the doors. A line of both armored trucks and a section of our ASV’s were outside, so I followed the scurrying medics until I came to the double doors of an old gymnasium.

Makeshift beds, cots, and simple blankets spread on the floor were lined against both walls, packed full of wounded. Some were ours, others resistance fighters, but many seemed to be non-combatant locals who’d been caught in the crossfire. There weren’t any captured ELSAR troops, and judging by the few resistance guards that lounged by the door, I didn’t figure any of their wounded got that far. The air stank of coppery blood, cries of pain echoed from every corner, and the floor glistened with crimson stains. Kerosene lamps and candles lit up the dark interior, the power long gone, and dust filtered down from the ceiling with every nearby shell impact. It stank of bleach, vomit, and unwashed bodies, a combination that made my skin crawl.

*Imagine the infections that are going to come out of all this.*

Ethan and some of his workers were already there, helping to shore up the building’s defenses with sandbags, bits of rubble, and barbed wire. Even though the perimeter wall would keep most of the mutants at bay, we were now in a big cement arena where ELSAR troops could sneak right up to our window at night. Judging by the nature of the ruins I’d seen coming in, fighting was already becoming a house-to-house affair, and every strong point would have to be hardened as if it were outside the wall itself.

Next to Ethan, a girl with chestnut colored hair looked up to see me and waved. “Hey, Sean’s in the back with a few others. He was getting ready to call you, but the radios are starting to act up. They’re in room 111.”

I hadn’t interacted with Kendra Smith very much, as she spent most of her time with the supply crews. Like so many couples within our little coalition, she and Ethan worked together, pitched a tent together, and were in the same mobile unit for the offensive. Of course, not every couple was so lucky; Chris and I were prime examples of those who fought in different units and spent more time apart than together. Still, I waved back, and with Lucille at my heels, trudged through the gymnasium to the opposite end, where another set of double doors led us into a long hallway lined with classrooms.

“There’s so many.”

Looking back over my shoulder, I noticed Lucille’s crestfallen face as we passed the lines of wounded to go into the hall. It hit me that she knew many of them, that this was her home, her neighborhood, her friends. It wasn’t the same for me; Louisville wasn’t under attack, there weren’t bombs falling on my suburban doorstep. My old home was as distant to me as Mars, but for Lucille, she had to watch everything she loved be ripped apart before her eyes.

“The sooner we end this war, the safer everyone will be.” I gave her shoulder a squeeze and gestured for her to follow me on down the hall. “That’s why we’re here. Every block we take, saves lives.”

“I guess so.” Lucille frowned in thought, but nodded, her pace increasing to stay consistent with mine. “Here, it’s this way. Room 111 is the old science lab, where Mrs. Frenburg used to teach. She kicked me out of class for being late once. Wonder where she is now.”

Making our way down the debris-strewn hall, we found the old science room a tangle of resistance and coalition runners, each scrambling back and forth to get messages out to various units. Sean stood in the back of the room, going over a map sketched onto a white dry erase board, and by his side was a slender figure with long red hair, a new M4 rifle over one shoulder.

Lucille darted from my side in an instant, and sprinted across the room, almost knocking over a few of the runners in the process. “Andrea!”

She turned, and Andrea’s face lit up with joy as she swept her little sister up into a fierce embrace. I caught crystalline rivers flowing from their eyes, quiet sobs racking the shoulders of both girls, and I swallowed hard against my own tide of emotion. For all her stubbornness, her relative naiveté, and occasional teenage angst, Lucille loved her sister, and no one deserved this reunion more. She’d been looking forward to this for a long time, and I was simply relieved it hadn’t ended in a casket.

*Most won’t even get that.*

Wiping at her face, Andrea held her younger sister at arm’s length and looked her over, laughter interlaced with residual sniffles. “Look at you, all dressed up, with a helmet and everything. Told you the countryside would be nice. Have you been eating enough?”

“Yeah, I’m eating fine.” Lucille blushed at Andrea’s hovering, but nodded my way with pride, her eyes red and puffy despite attempts to appear unmoved. “I’m fighting, just like you. We’re going to push the Organs all the way out of the county.”

Our gazes met, and Andrea threw me a grateful nod that bordered on another breakdown. “It’s really good to see you.”

I smiled. “Likewise. Glad to see you’re still keeping the Organs on their toes. How’s everything at the Castle?”

A ripple of pain cut through her face, and Andrea looked down at her scuffed shoes for a moment. “ELSAR’s been hitting us hard for days. One of their bombs got lucky and collapsed a section of the tunnel. Lost a lot of good people . . . including Professor Carheim.”

My heart tumbled in my chest, and I had to look away as well. The resistance had converted an unfinished subway system into an underground haven for their movement, given the grandiose nicknamed ‘the Castle’. It was there I’d been smuggled off to after my liberation from ELSAR captivity, and it was there I’d met Professor Henry J. Carheim. He’d been a lecturer at Black Oak University, the local college before the Breach, and one of the few in academia who refused to bend the knee to the provisional government. Determined to preserve the last shreds of human culture from the incinerators of the Organs, Professor Carheim managed to steal many of the university library’s books and secreted them away in his own miniature institute built in the Castle. He was a striking man, razor sharp and insightful, with a certain philosophical whimsy to his words that I could have listened to for hours. In many ways, he reminded me of those wizards I always saw included within fantasy books, minus the stereotypical beard and cloak, and he had always been unfailingly patient with my numerous questions. I had never been to college, could never have afforded to pay back the government loans if I tried, but I always liked to think Professor Carheim would have been an incredible teacher to study under. Now he was gone, crushed under the weight of the machine he strove so hard to dismantle, and it produced a mournful ache within my soul I didn’t know to be possible.

*Another part of the old world, gone forever.*

“Maybe we can move them back above ground.” Shaking off the heavy sadness, I adjusted the straps of my knapsack as they dug into my shoulders. “The southern areas are under our control now, so we can start evacuating some of the people to that sector. If we can radio Chris, I’m sure he’d be all for it.”

“On that note, you’re just in time.” Sean beckoned to us from behind a nearby lab table, his rifle and radio close at hand. “I’ve been trying to get a hold of you, but ELSAR must have some kind of jamming system active; our comms have been down since we entered the city. Everything has to be passed by hand now.”

He gestured to the white-board map, where little paper squares had been taped on to show where our forces were. “Dekker and the bulk of our fighters are pushing hard in the center, to try and get control of the courthouse, police department, and ELSAR HQ. There’s also the hospital facilities there, which would be helpful if captured intact. Most of the resistance is on the move in the eastern sector, clearing out the old suburbs and heading for the airfield in the north. We need to keep our momentum going here in the western districts and see if we can’t flank to the north to help Dekker in the center. Are your boys in good shape?”

Lungs tight with anxiety for what I knew was coming, I nodded. “We’re ready whenever you need us.”

“Good. There’s an enemy mortar team somewhere in this vicinity.” He pointed to a cluster of buildings on a paper street map on the table before him, and Sean glowered at it as if the map were the enemy itself. “Nasty bunch, really good at moving around, so we can’t pinpoint them. Every time we get close, they use suicide drones to force our ASV’s back, and then relocate. If you can flush them out, that’d make our advance northward a whole lot easier, not to mention make civilian evacuation to the southern districts safer.”

“Can do.” I drew my little notebook from the breast pocket of my uniform jacket and scribbled down as much as I could with my stubby pencil.

Sean set both hands on his war belt just above each hip. “We’re making far better progress than I expected. It seems we caught ELSAR on the back foot, maybe rotating men out or they deployed them elsewhere. There should be twice this number in Black Oak alone, but beggars can’t be choosers. If we take the town before they get back, we can seal the gates and force them to the border.”

“There’s an Organ training facility in the north.” Andrea pointed to a place in the northern districts, where large gray blocks denoted industrial parks and a green blot for a golf course. “They’ve got a prison camp there as well, for all the people who didn’t submit to the regime when it first came to town. If we could capture it before they move the prisoners, we could easily double our number of fighters. You’ve got lots of ammo; we’ve got lots of captured ELSAR weapons. With those prisoners on our side, we could have a standing army of 2,000 men.”

*2,000. That’s a lot of mouths to feed. How are we going to get through the winter with so many people depending on us?*

Keeping my uncomfortable thoughts to myself, I continued to draw a small map within my notebook, just to be sure I had all the information I needed. With the radios down, I couldn’t afford to leave any information uncopied, since I might not have the chance to ask a second time.

Sean rubbed his chin and glanced at me. “I’ll send you with a crew of armed Workers as well as some Ark River fighters to find and destroy that mortar team. If you can, push on and try to flank the center to get to the prison camp. We could use the extra muscle, even if half of them might not be in fighting condition.”

“Will do, sir.” With my hand aching from writing so much so fast, I snapped a quick salute and turned to go.

Lucille plodded along beside me, and I paused by the door to Room 111 to gesture back toward her sister. “You can stay, you know. I’m sure Andrea could use your help. You don’t have to come with me.”

She looked back for a moment, longing in her oak-brown irises, but shook her head. “It’s like you said. We have to finish this. I’ll come back later.”

A small flicker of pride crossed my face in the form of a smile. She might not have been my sister, but as my aide-de-camp, Lucille Campbell had the makings of a good soldier. Perhaps if she survived this war, I could recommend her for a ranger position. I would teach her like Jamie taught me, and with any luck, Lucille could lead a platoon of her own someday. The thought gave me back some of the warmth stolen by our bleak surroundings, and I relished it for as long as I could.

*First, we have to win the war.*

Together, we walked out of that room and back toward the rumbling trucks of our convoy, as the distant thunder of artillery echoed in the sky like the drumbeats of ancient giants. Overhead, shells whistled like freight trains, both the enemy’s coming in, and ours going out. Machine gun fire rattled on in the background, and from the gymnasium the cries of the wounded mixed with the calls of the medics into a blend of human suffering. Still, in all this, a new determination seized me, burned like a fire inside my heart, and gave a spring to my step. We had come this far, freedom was within our reach, and Koranti seemed to be on the brink of collapse.

With each step forward, I vowed that I would do everything within my power to shove him over the edge of defeat, even if I had to do it with my bare hands.
