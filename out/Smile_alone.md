It was 15th October 2019, my parents said goodbye to me as they were going out for a few hours. I was left home alone. They said they'd be back by 9 so I was in charge of dinner. It was about 7:30 when I stopped playing video games and realized that I had to make some dinner. I ended up having a microwaved curry. I heard the microwave hum as it was microwaving the curry. The hums cleared my mind. I was concentrating purely on the microwave. I zoned back in after hearing a sound that did not come from the microwave. It was a loud bang sound, as if something or someone had crashed into the front door. I crept to the door and opened it, shaking with fear. I saw nothing at first, just the emptiness of the night. Somewhere in the back, however, was a dark figure standing there. It looked like it had some sort of mask on, like a smile of some sorts. I went to take a photo of it but when I lifted my phone and looked at the camera, it wasn't there anymore. My heart sank as the figure that was once there was no more. I thought to myself that it was just my mind playing tricks on me.

I lived in an area where the neighbors weren't the easiest to get to, so I called them up and told them if they see anyone wearing a smile mask that they should call someone immediately. I didn't tell them why, I only told them it were on the news that night. I heard my microwave beep at last. I remember only putting the curry in for 5 minutes, but the clock read 8:00pm. Somehow, time managed to skip 30 seconds. I thought that was strange but carried on to eat my curry. I looked out the window for a split second and saw it again. I saw the same figure with the same smile. I called the police where they sent two officers down. They inspected the yard but found nobody. They said that the figure must have ran away, and told me to call if I saw it again. I went back out to where I saw the figure standing in the yard after the officers went but found nothing just as they did. I shrugged it off but kept on the lookout. I had the police on speed dial as I would like to call the police when I saw it.

2:24 am the clock read, I was still home alone. I kept calling mother but she never answered, nor did father. I saw the face in the window behind me when I was looking in the mirror questioning what has happened to reality. I once again called the police but did not tell them that my family hadn't come home yet. The police found the very mask I was seeing and a patch of blood but no person. They couldn't find a match for the blood or any DNA matches for the fingerprints on the mask. To this very day, I have never seen the face again and the police have never found anyone matching the DNA. I still have nightmares about this.
