As we make our way back through the factory's desolate skeleton, the ghostly echoes of the night's atrocities seem to claw at our heels. We tread back to our car in silence, the weight of what we've just witnessed heavy on our shoulders.

The drive to Kira's house is a blur, the city lights streaking past as we're consumed by our thoughts. The usual cacophony of New Orleans nightlife sounds muffled, distant, as if we're hearing it from underwater.

Anger, confusion, and a profound sense of betrayal swirl within me like a tempest. Beside me, Reine is a statue of contained fury, her hands clenched so tightly I can see the white of her knuckles.

We pull up to Kira's quaint, well-lit house, the normalcy of it a stark contrast to the darkness we've just left. Before we can even knock, the door swings open, and there stands Kira, her eyes filled with concern.

Kira's voice, usually so full of life, comes out strained, "What happened?" She says. Then, her eyes flick to Reine, and her expression tightens. "You told her?" she asks, a note of hurt resonating in her words. "You promised me you wouldn't."

Reine's voice cuts through the tension like a knife. "I'm the least of your problems now," she says, her tone leaving no room for argument.

"Kira," I start, my voice is a controlled tremor. "We need to talk. Now."

The atmosphere in Kira's living room is tense, the air thick with unspoken questions. "Are the kids here?" I ask immediately, my voice betraying a hint of urgency.

Kira shakes her head, her brows knitting together in concern. "No, they're staying with mom and dad for the night," she replies, her voice steady but her eyes searching ours for clues.

Reine and I exchange a glance, an unspoken agreement passing between us. This is going to get ugly, and it's a small mercy that Theo and Mia won’t witness it.

I draw the half-burnt photograph from my pocket and place it on the coffee table before Kira. Her eyes flicker over the image, recognition flashing in her gaze before it's quickly clouded by apprehension.

"Kira, what the fuck is going on?" I demand, my patience worn to a thread. "What are you involved in?"

Her living room, once a warm, inviting space filled with memories and laughter, transforms into a [cold](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14c93t1/im_an_arctic_researcher_we_accidentally_released/) interrogation room under the weight of our stares.

Kira's expression shifts as she glances at the photograph, her earlier concern morphing into something resembling fear. She tries to feign ignorance, her voice faltering as she speaks. "I-I don't know what this is about, Anh. It's been years since I've seen any of these people."

Reine's patience snaps like a dry twig. "Cut the bullshit, Kira," she hisses, her voice a venomous whisper. "I was a cop. I can make you talk, hurt you without leaving a mark."

Kira's facade cracks, her eyes darting towards me. There's a raw desperation there, one that I've seen before — the look of someone trapped with no clear way out. there's undeniable fear in her gaze. Fear of the truth, or fear for her life?

"Kira," I say, my voice a mix of anger and concern. "We know Xuan's involved in something dark. But you? You’re my sister… I need to be able to trust you."

The blood drains from Kira's face, her body slumping as if the weight of her secrets is physically crushing her. She glances at the photograph again, her fingers tracing the edges as if trying to draw strength from the past.

"It started as a research group," she begins, her voice a trembling whisper. "We were... are all academics, experts in our fields. Xuan introduced me to them. They called it the Nexus Consortium."

Kira leans forward, her fingers tightly intertwined, a sure sign of her anxiety. "At first, it was all theoretical," she explains. "Discussions about the nature of reality, quantum mechanics, ancient mythologies. It was... exhilarating, being part of such a groundbreaking group."

Her words trail off, a shadow crossing her face. "But then, things changed. The theories became... practices. Rituals. I thought it was just Xuan being eccentric, his way of making sense of the universe."

The air feels stagnant, heavy with her admission. Reine’s voice slices through the tension, "Rituals? What kind of rituals, Kira?"

Kira looks down, her hands clasped so tightly her knuckles turn white. "They started to talk about contacting [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGd1F6Ay8ho)... entities. Beings beyond our understanding. Xuan was convinced we could bridge the gap between worlds."

"And you believed him?" I press.

She shakes her head, a tear trailing down her cheek. "No, not at first. But then I saw things, Ash. Things I can't explain. Lights in the sky, shadows that moved on their own, voices from nowhere. They showed me proof, or what they claimed was proof."

Reine’s voice is softer now, but the undercurrent of urgency remains. "Kira, what kind of proof?"

"It's better if you see it," Kira whispers, standing up abruptly. "Come with me."

We follow Kira down a narrow hallway lined with family photos, the progression of years captured in frames. Her strides are purposeful, a contrast to the uncertain tremor in her voice. We reach the end of the corridor, and she opens the door to her office.

The office is a reflection of Kira’s world, a realm of ancient languages and histories long past. Bookshelves line the walls, crammed with tomes and papers, the musty scent of old books a familiar comfort. Her desk is cluttered with notes and texts, among which sits a state-of-the-art computer, a juxtaposition of the old and the new. Everywhere there are hints of her profession as a historical linguist – framed diplomas, a collection of rare dictionaries, and scattered artifacts that speak of a life dedicated to deciphering the secrets of bygone eras.

As Kira flicks on the light, it casts a warm glow over the room, illuminating the artifacts of her scholarly pursuits. She unlocks a cabinet, her hands shaking ever so slightly as she retrieves a thick, leather-bound manuscript. It's ancient, the cover worn with age. She handles it with reverence of a holy relic.

She lays the manuscript gently on the table, its pages yellowed with the passage of centuries. The room falls silent except for the faint creak of the leather as she opens the cover.

Reine and I perch on the edge of Kira’s cluttered desk, leaning in to get a closer look at the mysterious manuscript now laid before us.

Her fingers trace the delicate, classical Chữ Nôm script, the traditional Vietnamese calligraphy. "Xuan brought this to me," she says, her voice barely above a whisper. "He wanted me to translate it. Said it was vital for his... our research."

Kira turns the pages slowly, allowing us to take in the detailed illustrations and calligraphy. "This manuscript," she explains, her voice hushed as if the book itself might overhear, "chronicles the Mongol invasion of Vietnam in the 13th century."

The pages are a tapestry of chaos and violence; inked drawings of horsemen, arrows mid-flight, and warriors clashing with a ferocity that seems to leap off the page. "The detail here," Kira continues, "it's unprecedented. It had to have been created by someone who witnessed these events. Someone who... who somehow survived them."

“Are you saying this is a first-hand account?” I ask.

"Yeah," Kira nods. "The only one of its kind in existence. The author… he describes the horrors with such... such vividness." She pauses, her eyes lingering on an intricate drawing of a battlefield.

I lean in closer, examining the pages. The detailed sketches depict the chaos of battle, the desperation and fear etched into the faces of soldiers and civilians alike. Scenes of villages aflame, families torn apart, and the unrelenting advance of the Mongol horde sprawl across the parchment. It's a tableau of suffering and resistance, a visual saga of a nation under siege.

I can't help but feel a stirring of something deep within me—a resonance with the nameless author. As a combat veteran myself, I've seen my own share of conflict, the kind that leaves a mark on your soul. I understand the need to record the tumult, to ensure that the sacrifices and horrors aren't swept away by the tides of time.

In these ancient lines, I see the faces of my ancestors. I know their fear, their courage—it's imprinted in my very DNA. It's a haunting recognition, a connection across centuries that I feel in my bones.

Her voice cracks with emotion. "Xuan... he became obsessed with this past, with something he believed it could unlock."

Kira’s hands tremble as she carefully flips through the manuscript, stopping at a series of illustrations that command our immediate attention. The page depicts a naval battle, chaotic and vivid, with Vietnamese war junks engaged in fierce combat against the formidable Mongol fleet.

But amid the artistry of war, a singular element casts a shadow of dread across the scene: a black flame, rising from the depths of the water, engulfing the Mongol ships. The flames are not just dark; they are void of light, a blackness so profound that it seems to leach the very essence of life from the page.

The drawing is exquisite in its detail, capturing the horror of the moment. The water around the ships boils with the intensity of the unnatural inferno, while above, the sky appears to recoil in fear, storm clouds retreating from the eldritch blaze.

The Mongol warriors, once fierce and indomitable, now claw at their faces and bodies, desperate to escape an enemy that is relentless, inescapable. The black flame engulfs everything, sparing nothing and no one in its path.

They’re not merely consumed by fire; they’re erased, their forms distorted and twisted into expressions of abject terror. It’s as if the flame is alive, sentient, and reveling in the destruction it sows.

"This is Lửa Đen," Kira whispers, her voice a strained thread of sound. "The Black Flame."

The mention of Lửa Đen sends a shiver down my spine. Reine and I exchange a horrified look, the reality of the day's events crashing down upon us with renewed force.

My hand recoils from the page as if the black flame itself were leaping from the manuscript, the name Lửa Đen echoing in my ears, a sinister whisper from the past that has infiltrated the present.

Reine leans forward, her detective's eye pinpointing the most haunting aspect of the illustration. She points to the corner of the scene where a group of robed figures stand in a circle, their hands raised as if conducting the chaos unfolding before them. At their feet, the bodies of fallen warriors dissolve, their essence rising to be captured by the outstretched hands of the figures.

"This..." Reine's voice shakes as she speaks, "we've just seen this.”

Kira's eyes widen at Reine's statement, a mixture of shock and disbelief etching her face. "You've seen it?"

"Yeah," I say, my voice firm, "The same ritual, the same black flame, the same... dissolution of human flesh." The words taste bitter, recounting the horror feels like reliving it.

Kira's her face ashen, eyes lost to a memory that haunts her. "Xuan was convinced the depiction was literal," she begins, her voice quivering. "Not just him, the entire consortium. They believed this manuscript wasn't just recording history—it was a guide, a set of instructions."

Reine's face hardens with resolve, but there's a tremor in her voice when she asks, "Were they planning to recreate the ritual, Kira?"

Kira nods slowly, a haunted look in her eyes. "They weren't satisfied with a recreation," she confesses, her voice barely more than a whisper. "They believed the being depicted in the manuscript was only a fragment of Lửa Đen's true power. They wanted to bring the Black Flame into this world, in his full, terrifying form."

Kira's admission casts a shadow across the room, the very air seeming to grow colder with her words. "They talked about Lửa Đen as if he were... salvation," she continues, her gaze distant. "A cleansing fire to burn away the corruption of this universe and give rise to a new order."

Kira's eyes lock onto the manuscript, her fingers hovering over the ancient text as if she could still feel the heat of the Black Flame on the pages. "They were building a device," she murmurs, her voice breaking with the weight of her confession. "Xuan and the consortium, they pooled their knowledge, their resources... They wanted to create a bridge, portal to bring Lửa Đen into our world."

"A portal?" Reine asks, her eyes narrowing. "You mean the Void Whisperer?"

Kira's expression is one of disbelief as she realizes how much we already know. "The Void Whisperer," she echoes, her surprise evident. "Yeah, that's what they called it. They believed they could power the device with the dissolved essence of human bodies," Kira adds, her voice a mere breath.

"I never... I never really believed they could do it. I thought it was all theoretical, a madman's dream," Kira adds, her voice a mere breath.

She stands up, pacing the room, a caged [animal](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1581vef/our_search_for_a_missing_teen_uncovered_the/) finally revealing the depths of its despair. "They changed," she says, her voice hollow. "They started as scholars, as visionaries, but... then they started talking about sacrifices, about 'preparing the way.' Their eyes... They had this look in them. It scared me."

Kira stops, her back to us, her shoulders heaving with silent sobs. "That's why I left Xuan," she confesses, her voice so faint it's almost lost in the stillness of the room. "I couldn't be a part of that darkness. It was consuming him, them... and I feared it would consume me next."

The silence stretches, thick and heavy, before I break it with a question that's been burning inside me since we saw the photograph.

"Why didn't you tell me any of this, Kira?"

She turns to face us, and in her eyes, I see a maelstrom of fear, guilt, and desperation. "Xuan," she whispers, the name a curse. "He... he threatened me. He said if I told a soul, I'd never see the kids again. He said he'd take them away, that he had the resources to disappear and I'd never find them."

Reine gasps, horror etched on her face. "He threatened you with your own children?" Her voice is a mix of shock and anger, her protective instincts flaring.

Kira nods, tears streaming down her cheeks. "Yeah. And I... I believed him. He's not the man I married, not anymore. He's part of something else, something that's consumed him."

The unease in my gut twists tighter, the kind of instinctual warning that's saved my skin more times than I can count. I eye the manuscript, its [ancient](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/174jp2m/im_a_cop_on_the_navajo_reservation_i_investigated/) pages a stark reminder of the madness Kira's tangled up in. If Xuan's as deep in this as she says, why would he leave such a crucial piece of the puzzle in her hands?

My mind races back to that conversation between Xuan and Lockhart, the way they spoke about 'loose ends.' A chill skates down my spine. Loose ends... that’s what we are now. Witnesses. Kira's eyes are wide, scared, and it hits me — she knows it too.

I look at Reine, and I can tell she's come to the same conclusion; it's not safe here anymore. The Nexus Consortium, the Black Flame, Xuan's transformation — it's all spiraled into a situation far more dangerous than any of us could have imagined. Kira's house, once a haven, now feels like a trap, the walls bearing down on us with the weight of our newfound knowledge.

"Kira, you need to pack. Now," I say, my voice low and urgent. "Grab what you can't live without. We have to get you and the kids somewhere safe, away from Xuan and his... whatever the hell this is."

Kira's eyes are wide, her fear palpable. "But where? He'll find us."

I reach for her hand, gripping it firmly. "We'll take care of it. We have contacts, places he won't find. But we need to move fast."

Reine is already on her feet, scanning the room. "I'll help her pack. You make the call to your parents, make sure they're ready when we swing by," she says, already directing Kira towards the bedrooms.

—

I pull out my phone, turning off airplane mode for the first time since this morning. I quickly dial my parents, the phone ringing twice before my father’s voice comes through, gruff and worried. "Ash? What's wrong?" he asks immediately; he always had a sixth sense for trouble.

"Ba, listen to me," I start, trying to keep my voice steady, "I need you to gather the kids, pack essentials, and wait for my signal. We need to get you all to a safe location as soon as possible."

There's a pause, and then the sound of my mother's voice in the background, her tone anxious.

"What’s happening, con?" My mom asks, concern in her voice.

“I can't explain right now, but trust me. You’re not safe,” I say. “I’ll be there soon."

My father's voice is back, solid as a rock in the churning sea. "We'll be ready."

The air is heavy with the unspoken fear of our predicament as I make my way to Theo's room to pack his belongings. The brightly colored room, usually filled with the sounds of childish laughter and play, now stands ominously quiet, the toys and books casting long, eerie shadows in the dim light.

I open my nephew's small closet, gathering clothes, a few favorite toys he wouldn't want to sleep without, and the well-worn teddy bear that's accompanied him since he was a baby. The normalcy of these items, the contrast to the chaos unfurling outside these walls, tightens the knot in my gut.

Just then, I sense the presence before I see it, a slight disturbance in the still air of Theo's room. A creak of the wooden floorboards, a whisper of movement. Instinctively, my hand moves to the concealed gun at my side, but I freeze as a cold voice slices through the silence.

"Don't even think about it."

The voice is barely above a whisper, but its icy command sends a jolt of adrenaline through me.

As the cold metal of a suppressor presses firmly against my back, a shiver of cold dread runs down my spine. I can hear the stranger's steady breathing just inches from my ear, controlled and measured. Slowly, I raise my hands, showing them empty and palms out.

The stranger expertly disarms me, the weight of my gun leaving my side with a swift, practiced motion. It's a familiar routine, one that leaves me feeling vulnerable, the absence of the firearm like a missing limb.

"Turn around. Slowly," the voice demands, a gravelly whisper that speaks of a deadly calm.

I comply, my movements deliberate and cautious. The intruder is clad in all black, a ski mask obscuring his features.

It's evident he came for Kira, to silence her before she could spill more secrets. His plan is apparent: stage a botched burglary where Kira would be the tragic casualty, an accidental victim in a city where violence is all too common. In his eyes, though, I see a glint of surprise; he hadn't planned on me, an unforeseen obstacle in his grim agenda.

"Who are you?" he questions sharply, his gun never wavering from its target.

I weigh my response carefully. I give him a half-truth.

"I'm just a visitor. Wrong place, wrong time," I say, my voice steady despite the ice coursing through my veins.

His eyes narrow, searching for the lie, probing for a crack in my facade. "You're lying. What did you see?"

"Nothing worth dying over," I respond, trying to keep the tension from my voice.

"Where is she? Where is the apostate Kira?" He asks.

"I don't know who you're talking about. You've got the wrong place, buddy." I reply.

The intruder's finger tightens on the trigger, a hair's breadth from a decision. I can almost hear his thoughts, the weighing of options. I stand still, my mind racing for any edge, any distraction that could tilt the scales in our favor.

Suddenly, the door creaks open, and Reine steps into the room, her arms full of Mia's clothes. Her eyes are on the pile in her arms as she speaks. "Ash, you ready to—"

Time seems to slow down as the intruder swings his weapon toward Reine, his finger tensing on the trigger. She looks up, her eyes widening in shock as she sees the gun pointed at her.

Acting on pure instinct, I lunge at the stranger, my movement throwing off his aim. The bullet whizzes past Reine's head, embedding itself into the wall with a thud that echoes in the sudden silence.

All hell breaks loose.

The room is a whirlwind of violence and desperation. I tackle him to the ground, his body surprisingly heavy, betraying a professional's build and strength. We roll across the hardwood floor, each strike from his trained fists and elbows sharp and accurate, each block and counter from me born of desperation and raw survival instinct.

In the melee, my hand finds the edge of his mask, and with a forceful yank, it peels away, revealing a man whose face is a canvas of dark tattoos, swirling patterns that match the markings I've seen on the other cultists.

Reine drops the clothes and draws her sidearm, her eyes darting for a split second to find a clear shot, but our tangled bodies offer her no opportunity. The assassin is quick, resourceful, and vicious. His movements are methodical, clinical, the movements of a man who's made a living dealing death.

A well-placed kick from the assailant sends me reeling, my back slamming against the wall with a force that knocks the air from my lungs. He's on his feet in an instant, bearing down on me with the cold precision of a man who's done this too many times before.

He throws me into Reine with all his might. We crash to the ground in a heap, her pistol skittering out of reach across the smooth wooden floor. Pain lances through my side, sharp and unyielding. Reine's breath is ragged against my cheek, her own pain a silent scream in the close air of the room.

As the assailant towers over us, his silhouette a menacing shadow against the light from the doorway, I can see the calculation in his eyes, weighing his next move. Reine and I are down but not defeated, our breaths heavy with pain but also with the unspoken vow to protect each other at all costs.

With a swift motion, I try to roll away, hoping to draw his attention and give Reine a moment to recover. He anticipates the move, his boot coming down hard against my ribcage, a sharp crack echoing in my ears that I know is not just from the wooden floor. Pain explodes across my vision, bright and blinding, but it also ignites a fierce will within me—a determination not to let this be the end.

Reine, ever the fighter, doesn't stay down for long. With a grunt of effort, she pushes herself to her knees, tackling the assailant's legs. Her movement is less a trained technique and more raw, primal effort, fueled by adrenaline and the instinct to survive, to fight back against the darkness closing in.

Her blows are a whirlwind of rage and desperation, her fists connecting with the force of pent-up fury. She fights like a woman possessed, her every strike aimed with lethal intent. Her knuckles are bloodied. But the assailant is no amateur; his reflexes are sharp, his defenses calculated.

He catches her fist mid-swing, his grip iron, unyielding. With a vicious twist, he bends her wrist back, the angle unnatural, the pain searing. Reine's cry of agony is a ragged sound that tears through the room.

The assailant towers over me, his grip on Reine unrelenting as he reaches for the knife strapped to his side. The blade glints ominously in the dim light, its sharp edge promising a swift and brutal end. I can see the cold intent in his eyes, the finality of the movement as he raises the knife.

Every fiber of my being screams in protest, my limbs heavy with pain and desperation. My vision is blurred, my breaths coming in shallow gasps, but the sight of Reine in his grasp ignites a fire within me, a surge of adrenaline that refuses to let this be her demise.

As I launch myself at the attacker, aiming to throw him off balance, my weakened state betrays me. He easily sidesteps, his counter swift and brutal, a knee driven hard into my abdomen. Air whooshes out of my lungs, and I crumple, the room spinning wildly.

Through the haze of pain, I see the knife descending towards me, the arc of its descent like the slow ticking of a clock, each second stretching into eternity. I brace for the impact, for the cold bite of the blade.

But it never comes.

A muffled shot rings out, sharp and definitive, halting the knife's deadly descent. The room falls silent but for the ringing in my ears. The assassin's body jerks violently, a look of stunned disbelief etched on his face.

Blood blooms across his chest, spreading rapidly through the fabric of his shirt. He staggers backward, his movements now sluggish, his grip on the knife faltering. He looks down at the growing red stain in confusion, as if unable to comprehend this sudden reversal of fate.

Kira stands in the doorway, the attacker's pistol trembling in her hands. Her eyes are wide with shock, her breaths coming in short, sharp gasps. The weapon, a foreign object in her unsteady grip, is pointed at the assassin, smoke wafting from the barrel.

She drops the gun, the metallic sound of it hitting the floor punctuating the end of the encounter. She crumples, her knees buckling. Reine catches her before she hits the ground, her body wracked with sobs.

The assassin's body hits the floor with a heavy thud, his breaths ragged and shallow. Despite everything, no one deserves to die without a chance. I crawl over to him, Reine's worried gaze following me.

"Stay with me," I command, pressing my hands against the wound, trying to stem the tide of blood, but it’s like trying to hold back the ocean with a sieve. "Who sent you? Tell me about the Void Whisperer."

His eyes, a pale green that seems to mock the life slipping away, fix on me. Through bloodied lips, he chuckles, a sound chilling in its lack of life. "The Whisperer... will open the way," he gasps, the fanaticism clear even now. "The Black Flame... will cleanse us all."

"Where is it? Where is the Void Whisperer?" I press, my voice a mix of demand and plea.

He smiles, a terrible, knowing curve of his lips. "We are but vessels... for his glory. Martyrdom... is the path to eternity."

And that's when I see it—a capsule, nestled between his cheek and gum, shimmering with that same otherworldly luminescence we witnessed at the factory.

"No!" I reach out, but it's too late. He bites down on the capsule. A violent, shimmering reaction begins, his body convulsing as the substance spreads through his veins, his flesh starting to dissolve into stardust. His laughter—a haunting, hollow sound—echoes as his form becomes less and less human, his body disintegrating into the cosmos contained within him until nothing is left but a scattering of cosmic dust that fades into the night.

We're left there, panting, covered in sweat and blood, the silence oppressive. Kira’s sobs fill the room, for the darkness that has crept so close to her family.

Reine and I lock eyes, the unspoken question hanging between us. How many more? How many more zealots await, willing to kill and die for their cause? The thought chills me to the bone.
