When I moved into this building, I thought I’d lucked out.

Six units, quiet street, clean halls, cheap rent. The landlord said it was fully occupied. No families, no kids, no noise. Perfect for someone like me—keeps to himself, works from home, is as quiet as a mouse.

It took me three months to realize I’ve never seen another person here.

No neighbors in the stairwell. No footsteps above or below. No sounds through the walls. No music, no toilets flushing, no TVs. Just this dead, suffocating silence.

I started watching. Testing. I'd leave my unit at random hours—early morning, late night, middle of the afternoon. Always the same: lights off in every window but mine. No doors opening. No mail in any box but mine. Even the trash room is always empty except for my bags.

One night, I decided to leave a note on the building’s corkboard, saying something dumb like, 

>“Hey neighbors! Thought it’d be cool to start a group chat in case we ever need to reach each other. Text me if you’re interested!” 


I added my number and everything.


The note was gone the next day. Not a single message.

That’s when the noises started.

It began as something light. A floorboard creaking outside my door around 3 a.m. Then a dragging sound. Like something heavy being pulled down the hall—slow, deliberate. It never lasted long. Just enough to make sure I heard it.

The worst part? Every time I opened the door, the hallway looked completely untouched. Still. Airless.

A few nights later, I wedged a thin piece of printer paper under the front door, taped in place. I figured if someone opened it, the paper would tear or shift.

When I woke up the next morning, the paper was gone.

I didn’t hear anything that night. No footsteps. No dragging.

Just silence.

That was the same day I noticed something in my apartment had changed. My living room rug was slightly crooked. I never leave it like that. I fix it out of habit. But it had been rotated a few inches clockwise. Just enough for me to notice. Nothing else looked touched. Nothing stolen.

But that night, I didn’t sleep.

And the next morning, I found the paper I’d left under the door folded neatly and placed in the center of my kitchen counter.

I don’t know how to explain the feeling I had in that moment. Just the paper sitting there like it belonged. I didn’t move it for hours. I couldn’t bring myself to touch it. It felt like if I picked it up, whoever had put it there would know I was awake.

Two nights ago, I heard something inside my bedroom.

I woke up at 3:00 a.m. Exactly. I checked my phone. I heard a breath. Not mine. It came from the corner of the room near my closet.

I didn’t move. I didn’t turn on the light. I just lay there, listening, trying not to breathe too loud. I don’t know how long I stayed like that. But eventually I must’ve passed out from fear or exhaustion.

In the morning, my closet door was open.

I always keep it closed.

And last night…

Last night I came home from a late walk, trying to clear my head. The hallway lights didn’t turn on. Motion sensor, usually kicks in immediately. I had to use my phone flashlight.

I knew something was wrong the second I reached my door.

There was a photograph sticking out from under it.

I picked it up and immediately dropped it.

It was a picture of me. Lying in bed. Eyes closed. Same shirt I’d worn to sleep the night before. Same position. Same open closet door behind me.

The photo was taken from inside the room. Just a few feet away.

I searched the apartment top to bottom. Nothing. No signs of forced entry. All the locks untouched. Windows sealed. I even checked inside the walls behind the cabinets, behind the appliances. Nothing.

I didn’t sleep.

And now it’s morning. The photo’s still sitting on my table, facedown. I haven’t touched it since. I haven’t left the apartment. I don’t know if I’m trapped in here or if I’m keeping something out.

But here’s what I do know:

No one else lives in this building.

Someone is watching me.

And they have a key.


I don’t know how long this has been happening. I don’t know how much they’ve seen. But I can feel them getting closer.

I’m not alone.

Not anymore.
