You stumble through the thick bush painfully, the panting of your labored breaths and the sound of your body crushing it’s way through the thick vegetation basically shining a spotlight on your location. Not that it matters anyway, your stick out like a blazing sun to anyone with infra-red vision which is to say: almost models of hunter killers. By contrast your human eyes struggle to see anything under the light of the half-moon- it’s basically pure luck that you haven’t tripped and twisted some important tendon or other that humans need for locomotion. This is not helped by the fact that you have your hands pressed up tight against your face tight enough to be painful. You’re taking the barest of peeks every few seconds through your hands to avoid falling flat onto your face. You once again curse the fucker who stole your goggles, they were worth their weight in food and always in short supply, conveniently ignoring the fact that you first stole the goggles from some other poor fucker first. 

For a few more minutes you struggle on, painfully aware of the futility of your struggle, but unwilling to simply roll over and die, as the minutes dragged on you even began to hope against hope that you might get away to live a few more days, that they were busy with the other survivors or simply missed you fleeing the burning compound.  You don’t see or heard the twin 14 microsecond pulse of laser light that was timed perfectly to deliver 50 joules of high energy blue photons to burn out the retinas of both of your eyes. You simply feel an intense burning sensation and see a blinding flash of blue light, then complete darkness. You never even see or hear the lizard like robot perched on a tree 400 meters away that took the shot. You go down hard and stay down, it’s hopeless to do anything else at this point and you know it. But you still have hope, the robots sometimes leave blinded where they were to die of exposure or thirst as there’s no reason to waste a bullet or any effort to finish a kill. But often times they actually transported the blind to the remaining human enclaves and strongholds, this was to drain the humans of resources, a useless blind human to feed and house and when the blind were rejected or mercy killed as they often were, they badly affected morale. In your time at the compound, you hated and pitied them in equal measure, as they hogged the untainted food and water from the physically able, how the teeming masses of them tried their best to get inside the compound, begging for food, water and shelter, how you could feel everyone’s sanity fraying as they could only save a select few. 

But now? Even without sight, even knowing that you would be harming any groups that tried to help you, you don’t care, you want to survive. You could still be helpful, you aren’t like the rest of the useless survivors, you know your way around guns, you could help clean their guns and load clips, it might be worthy of a single meal a day- you keep telling yourself.  It was with a mixture of shame, relief and terror when you feel cold metal claws gripping your body. You don’t resist when a needle plunged into your arm and sent you into a deep sleep. Of course what you don’t know is that the robots have finally finished a virus that they have been working on for the last 4 months and that you and the rest of the refugees are going to be carriers for. Highly contagious, extremely lethal and designed to have a  long incubation period, it was a bioweapon meant to wipe out entire countries. By the next day, you will one of the messes of refugees begging to be let into one of the remaining population centres, carrying and spreading your deadly payload wherever you go. But even if you knew, you wouldn’t be too upset, everyone knew that humanity was fucked from the moment the war started.
