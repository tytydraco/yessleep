Story based on the original concept and screenplay by Jay Reeves.



The YouTube narrator leaned forward in his computer chair and opened a new email submission from a listener. It read;  

 Hello, my name's Gina. The following events took place when I was a sheriff's deputy many years ago, living in a small Texan town on the border with Mexico. I no longer live in this town, nor am I currently still in law enforcement. 

On the surface, it was a sleepy little nondescript town. Locking up the town drunk after a few too many was usually as serious as it got. Underneath the surface, however, it was a lot darker. I wasn't exactly innocent, either. To say this isn't a pleasant subject matter is a major understatement. Everyone in our town has heard the story in some form or another. Different people will tell different versions, but it’s the same story. 

I tried my best to forget what happened, but I recently overheard my daughter listening to your channel, and your content has made the memories come back in full force. I had never heard of a cryptid before, but my daughter’s really into this stuff. So, I listened to some of your shows with her about creatures like Dog Man and Goat Man, and it all came back 

This account is 100 percent true. This is the story of Donkey Man. 

Maya Cardona stopped on her way home to examine a spider in its web. She thought it was fascinating how it was both the spider’s home and a deadly trap at the same time. Touching the web would be a death sentence for anything other than the spider, and likewise, it couldn’t touch any other web without becoming stuck.  

She silently wished the spider good luck and went on her way, kicking an old beer can as she scuffled her feet along the pavement. Maya paused again at a telephone pole. It prominently displayed three flyers, each of them bearing the faces of three missing women. Each poster is a little more weathered than the previous one, a gradient pattern of fading hope from the top down. 

The tape on the third one had come off at the bottom, and it was flapping around in the wind. Maya put her hand on the poster to hold it steady and read it carefully, her lips moving as she sounded out the words in her head. A little shiver ran down her spine. She was old enough to understand the women on the posters were never coming home. 

She continued on her way and passed by three older girls playing hopscotch. As she quickly scooted around them, one of the girls tried to pick up her marker and accidentally touched the ground. 

Her friends pointed at her and gleefully chanted, “You're out, you're out! Donkey Man will tear your heart out!” 

The girl’s face turned pale as milk. She abruptly spun around and scampered away down the street. Maya watched her go with a troubled frown. One of the older girls noticed her standing there and snapped, “What are you looking at, kid?” 

Maya stammered, “Nothing. I’m just walking home.” 

“Then start walking and stop friggin’ staring,” the older girl snarled, and she took a menacing step forward. Maya mumbled an apology and hurried away. She had a weird feeling in the pit of her stomach. Something wasn’t right. She could almost smell the wrongness in the air, a low, acrid stench that lingered in the back of her throat. 

Maya thought about the faded smiles of the women on the flyers, and she started to walk even faster. 

Maya whispered, “Donkey Man will tear your heart out,” and her power walk abruptly turned into a full-on run. She ran the rest of the way home. 

The next day, Maya asked her grandmother, “What's Donkey Man?” 

Grandma glanced up from her book and gave Maya a stern look. She shook her finger and said, “Es malo. Muy malo. Don’t ask about it again. It is not something you should ever think about.” 

Maya went into her room. Grandma was always getting on Maya to learn Spanish. Maya had no interest in that, but she did pull out the English – Spanish dictionary that Grandma had gotten her for her last birthday. She flipped the pages to the letter M. She scrolled her finger down the page and stopped at “Malo.” Then slowly running her finger underneath the word. The definition read “Bad, wicked, immoral, evil, the Devil's work.” 

“The Devil’s work,” Maya whispered to herself, and she felt that shiver race down her spine again. The word ‘Malo’ grew bigger and bigger the longer she looked at it. It was only four letters on a page, but it somehow made her feel uneasy on a deep, primal level. 

In a hotel room across town from where Maya was now tossing and turning in her bed, finding it extremely hard to sleep. A young woman named Sonia was impatiently waiting for a client. She watched the ancient alarm clock on the nightstand slip from 12:13 AM to 12:14 AM and let out a deep sigh. She had graciously volunteered to stand in for her friend Renee, who had been complaining all night about her pounding headache. It was shaping up to be a big waste of time. 

Sonia let out a big yawn and glared at the clock again. She smacked her hands down on her knees and grunted, “Screw it. I’m out.” 

She grabbed her purse and angrily yanked open the door, almost storming directly into the figure who was standing on the other side. Sonia let out a little shriek and jumped back, stumbling a little in her high heels. 

“I thought you were gonna be a no-show,” she croaked, and she walked backwards as the figure advanced into the room. She bumped into the bed and fell into a sitting position, looking up at the client with eyes like saucers. 

The figure sat down beside her and fanned out three hundred-dollar bills beside her leg. She blinked at them, then stammered, “What... what do you want?” 

A gloved hand gently grasped her hair and pulled it away from her ears. The client whispered in her ear and pulled out a cat ‘o nine-tails whip. The whip was lightly dragged across her thigh. 

“No,” Sonia said in a sharp tone, and she shook her head for emphasis. “I don’t do that.” 

The client reached into a pocket and dropped a baggie of heroin on top of the money. Sonia stared at it, rubbing her crucifix necklace between her thumb and her fingers. And then she slowly nodded. 

“Okay,” Sonia murmured softly, and she tucked the money and the baggie into her purse. “Just give me a minute. I need some of this first. I’ll be right back.” 

Sonia closed the bathroom door and pulled out a rubber band, a burnt spoon, and a bottle of distilled water. She looked at herself in the mirror and saw tears shining in her eyes. She quavered, “You can do this. Just get it over with and forget about it.” 

An hour later, Sonia was standing behind a dumpster, shaking uncontrollably as she shoved the money into her purse. She dropped one of the bills and was seized by a wave of nausea as she bent to pick it up. After it was over, she took out a handkerchief and wiped her mouth. 

She groaned, “Oh my God,” and rinsed out her mouth with a swig from a faucet sticking out of the wall. Her hands were trembling so badly, she could barely light a cigarette. 

Sonia started walking, trying her best to keep it together and not crumple onto the sidewalk. It was late, the street was empty, and she just wanted to get home. When she was safe behind a locked door, she could allow herself to break down and have a long, ugly cry in the shower. For now, she had to go on autopilot and put down one foot after the other, like a machine, until she was far, far away from that hotel room. 

Sonia abruptly stopped and whirled around. She was positive she had heard a scraping footstep against the pavement, but no one was there. The street behind her was still empty. 

She started walking faster, clutching her purse against her side so it wouldn’t bounce off her ribs like a tiny wrecking ball. She threw her cigarette away and sniffed the air, her nose wrinkling in disgust. She could hear rapid footsteps closing in behind her. Her heart started beating wildly in her chest. The footsteps were catching up. 

 Sonia pulled a stiletto knife out of her purse and flicked it open as she turned around. She snarled, “Get away from me, creep!” and then her mouth dropped open. Her eyes grew wide as saucers, reflecting the image of her pursuer in the weak glow of the streetlights. She tried to scream, but nothing came out but a faint whistling sound. 

And then her throat was seized in an iron grip, and everything went black.  

A baseball bat flashed through the sunlight and slammed into a donkey-shaped pinata. A shower of brightly colored candy rained down, and a swarm of laughing children scrambled to snatch it out of the grass. Today was Andrew Oliva’s birthday. He had just turned eight, and he was having the time of his life. 

Several couples were standing in little clusters in the backyard, watching the kids romp around and chatting amongst each other. One man, however, was standing apart from the rest of the adults. He had a glass of whisky in one hand and a cigarette in the other. 

His name was Jesse Luna, and he was the town sheriff. You wouldn’t usually catch Sheriff Luna at a child’s birthday party, but Andrew was his nephew. 

He saw Eddie Oliva approaching, and he greeted him with a grunt and a slight nod of his head. Eddie quipped, “What’s happening, Lone Ranger? Why are you all by yourself over here?” 

“Because I feel like shit,” he grunted, and he held up a heavily bandaged hand. 

“Rough night?” 

“Yeah, probably,” Jesse rumbled. “I don’t really remember.” 

Eddie gave him a sympathetic look and said, “Yeah, that sounds familiar. That was before-” 

He was interrupted by his wife, Constance, who held out a plastic cup and murmured, “Jesse, you know we love you to death, but can you please put that thing out? I don’t want you to smoke in front of the kids.” 

He took one last puff and dutifully dropped the cigarette into the cup. 

“Thank you, sir,” she said primly, and she offered him a pack of gum. Jesse frowned at it and shook his head. 

He gulped down the rest of his drink with a low groan in the back of his throat. 

Constance gave him a faint frown and wandered away. Eddie leaned in closer and asked in a hushed tone, “So, when are we coming to your house to celebrate little Jesse’s or Jessica’s birthday? Time’s getting away from you, Jesse. No one’s getting any younger around here.” 

Jesse patted Eddie’s protruding gut with the back of his hand and rumbled, “I’ll start a family when you push yourself away from the table and lose the spare tire. 

Eddie gave him a sour look and said, “Are you gonna be a bachelor forever? You can’t spend the rest of your life alone.” 

“Sure, I can,” Jesse shot back. “Why the hell not?” 

“You're gonna be fifty years old, all alone in your house with a glass of whiskey and a cigarette.” 

“Sounds good to me,” Jesse sighed. “It could be a hell of a lot worse.” 

Eddie shook his head at him and said, “Sometimes, I wish that-” 

He was interrupted by Andrew, who came running up with bright eyes and a sweaty forehead. He gasped, “Thanks for the football, Uncle Jesse! It’s a real one, not one of those Nerf ones.” 

Jesse’s lips twitched in a brief smile. He said, “Just make sure there's a ticket waiting for me when you're playing for the Cowboys.” 

“You got it,” Andrew chirped. The rest of the children came running over, and one of them poked Andrew’s arm with an expectant look on her face. Andrew nodded and turned to his dad with a glimmer in his eye. 

“Dad, can you tell us the story about Donkey Man?” 

Eddie rolled his eyes and groaned, “If you had a dime for every time I’ve told that story-” 

“I’d have a dollar,” Andrew interrupted. “Anyway, they haven’t heard it yet. Come onnnnn, please?” 

“Your mom doesn’t like that story.” 

“Mom’s inside” Andrew grinned. “Come on, please? It’s my birthday, for crying out loud.” 

“He’s a little young for that, isn’t he?” Jesse observed, and Eddie shrugged. 

“I gave him a rated PG version,” Eddie assured him. “I don’t want to give the kid nightmares.” 

There was a knock at the gate, and deputy Gina Torres let herself in with an apologetic look on her face. Gina was trying to smile, but there was a look in the deputy’s eyes that Jesse knew all too well. He put his glass down on the table with a sinking feeling in his gut. 

“I’ll be right back,” he said, and he ambled over to talk to her. 

“What’s going on?” he asked.  

Gina gave him an unhappy look, shook her head, and said, “We’ve got another one.” 

“Well, shit,” Jesse sighed. “Okay, give me a second.” 

He waved Eddie over and told him, “I gotta go, thanks for having me over today.” 

“Thanks for coming,” Eddie smiled. “Are we still on for some pool on Friday?” 

Jesse gave Eddie a somber look and said “Anyway. Plans can change. It’s the job.” 

Eddie nodded and clapped him on the shoulder. Andrew waved and called out, “Bye, Uncle Jesse!” 

Jesse waved back and yelled, “Have a good one, kid! And keep this guy away from the beer, okay? He’s starting to look like he’s smuggling a basketball under his shirt.” 

Eddie smirked and gave him the finger. As Jesse was leaving, he heard Eddie tell the kids, “Okay, so about twenty years ago, there was this woman. Let's just say she was a dancer.” 

A little girl asked, “Like a ballerina?” 

Eddie stammered, “Uh, yeah, sure. Kinda like that. Anyway, there was this creepy old house in the woods that no one dared to enter...” 

Jesse climbed into his truck and closed the door. His expression was grim. He was about to deal with a real-life horror story. 

A short while later, Jesse was standing with Gina at a crime scene. They were looking down at a tarp on the ground. It was covering a body. 

“She got a name?” he asked mildly. 

“How do you know it’s a she?” Gina asked, and Jesse gave her a weary shrug. 

“Just a guess,” he murmured. 

“Her purse is over there,” Gina said. “Sonia Reynoso, twenty-one years old. She had three hundred dollars on her, and a small amount of heroin.” 

Jesse pursed his lips and shoved his hands into his pockets. 

“She didn’t run,” Gina said in a brisk tone. “She died where she was standing.” 

Jesse raised an eyebrow and asked, “How can we be sure about that?” 

Gina gave him an amused look and said, “She was still wearing her high heeled shoes. You don’t run in heels. You either take them off first, or you break an ankle.” 

Jesse knelt down and lifted the tarp. Gina turned away and covered her mouth with her hand. 

“She’s got a knife in her hand,” he observed. “There’s no blood on the blade. She didn’t get a chance to use it.” 

He dropped the tarp and stood up, groaning slightly at the twin pops in his kneecaps. He said, “She must’ve known the guy.” 

“How do you know it was a guy?” 

Jesse gave her a dry smile and said, “Same way I knew it was a woman under the tarp. Just a hunch.” 

Gina nodded slightly and asked, “Do you want me to track down her family and... um, her co-workers? Start the interviews?” 

“Worst part of the job,” Jesse said, and he grimaced. “Nah, you stay here and help process the crime scene. I’ll take care of it.” 

Gina gave him a grateful look and said, “Ten-four, Sheriff. Thank you. I hate that part, too.” 

Gina watched him climb into his truck with sympathetic eyes. When you wear the badge, you experience the very worst of humanity, day in and day out. Beneath the uniform, Jesse and Gina were just everyday people doing an unpleasant job, and there was very little reward. Many cops turned to the bottle to cope, and their divorce rate was off the charts. On days like today, Gina wished that she had chosen another career, and she definitely wasn’t alone. 

Gina softly whispered, “Good luck,” and she turned her attention back to the grisly task at hand.  

Sister Theresa was hard at work in the rose garden when she noticed a pair of black cowboy boots approaching from the corner of her eye. Father Delacruz smiled down at her and said, “Theresa, I'm telling you those rose bushes belong in one of those garden magazines.” 

Theresa smiled back and said, “Come on, Father. That’s a bit of an exaggeration.” 

He shook his head and bellowed, “Nonsense! I'm serious. I don't know why we're known for yellow roses in Texas when those beautiful red ones are right there.” 

He carefully touched a long thorn, and, in a somber tone, he said, “Theresa, another woman was murdered last night. They found her over by the hotel.” 

Theresa looked up at him with a dismayed expression. “What kind of a person would do this? This is a small town.” 

“It could be anyone,” he sighed. “Sin and evil aren't particular about the size of the town. Have you talked to your brother?” 

“Not for a couple days.”  

“Maybe you should,” Father Delacruz said. “I imagine he could use a little spiritual guidance right about now. I’m sure he’ll do his job. All we can do is pray.” 

Theresa watched him walk away, and then she pulled a locket on a chain from beneath her habit. She opened it and looked at the picture inside. It was a woman in her early twenties, along with a little boy and a girl. 

“Pray,” she repeated, and then she snapped the locket shut. It was best to not think about that, not now. There was work to do. 

Over at the high school, Ms. Pena’s 12th grade social studies class was discussing the topic of serial killers. At the front of the room, a poster board displayed pictures of Ted Bundy, Richard Ramirez, and John Wayne Gacy. Beneath the pictures, there was a quote from America’s first known serial killer H.H. Holmes. It read, "My features are assuming a pronounced, Satanical, cast. My head and face are gradually assuming an elongated shape. I am growing to resemble the devil. That the similitude is almost complete. In fact, so impressed am I with this belief that I am convinced that I no longer have anything human in me." 

Ms. Pena asked her class, “So are they monsters, or victims? Insane, just evil, or all the above?” 

Olivia Esparza raised her hand. “Nietzsche said, ‘That which is done out of love, always takes place beyond good, and evil.’” 

Ms. Pena gave her a skeptical look and asked, “They kill out of love?” 

Olivia shrugged and answered, “Love is very close to hate. I think some people can kill what they love.” 

Ms. Pena lifted an eyebrow and said, “Interesting. Some believe they're instructed by voices to murder. Some are lust killers who murder for sexual gratification. They’re generally sadists. Others consider themselves missionaries, to rid society of unwanted elements. A God complex, if you will.”  

Max Lucero piped up from the back of the class and said, “They’re all crazy.” 

Ms. Pena shook her head. 

“Most serial killers are not insane. They know the difference between right and wrong. They know what they're doing but choose to do it because it makes them feel good.” 

Another girl snorted, “In any case, they’re all men, aren’t they?” 

Ms. Pena shook her head again and countered, “Actually about ninety percent are men. Which leaves ten percent that... well, are not men.” 

Rose Santovena waved her hand in the air and chirped, “Yeah, like Elizabeth Bathory! She was a Hungarian Countess in the fifteenth century. I read that she committed over two hundred murders.” 

“That's right, Rosemary. She killed mostly servant girls and members of the lesser nobility. She believed that, by bathing in their blood, she would stay eternally youthful.” 

The bell rang, and Ms. Pena called out, “That’s it for today. See you tomorrow!” 

As the last of her students filed out the door, Ms. Pena pointed at Rose and asked, “Can I see you for a second, Rosemary?” 

Rose approached the desk with a guarded expression. In a hushed tone, Ms. Pena asked, “Do you think you can do another favor for me?” 

Rose nodded and said, “Same as before?” 

The teacher nodded. Rose said, “Sure. Hand it over.” 

An envelope passed hands, and Rose left without another word. 

Out in the parking lot, Rose caught up to Olivia and Max. Max turned to her and said, “Hey, Rosemary.” 

“Only Ms. Pena can call me that.” 

He snorted, “What’s that supposed to mean?” and Rose gave him a playful slug on the shoulder. 

“It means what it means,” she answered, and gave him a cryptic smile. 

“Well, I know what I’m gonna be after I graduate. A serial killa.” 

Rose smirked, “The pay isn’t great and the benefits suck. But you’ll have lots of time to work on your music in prison. You know, after you get caught.” 

“Did you hear about the latest murder?” Olivia interjected, and she shuddered. “They found her on the street.  

“From what I heard, killed’ is too weak of a description. She was mangled.” Rose replied. 

Max said, “You know who’s behind this, right?” 

Both girls groaned out loud, and Rose groaned, “Don’t start with that story again.” 

“It’s the Donkey Man,” he said in a spooky tone, and he curled his fingers into monster claws. 

Rose snapped, “Oh, shut up, idiot. It's a stupid urban legend. Like Chupacabra and La Llorona. It’s something parents tell kids, so we'll do our homework and eat our vegetables. But Donkey Man only kills bad girls, so we better behave, Olivia.” 

“Bad girls,” Max said in a creepy voice. “Baaaaad girrrrlsss.”
