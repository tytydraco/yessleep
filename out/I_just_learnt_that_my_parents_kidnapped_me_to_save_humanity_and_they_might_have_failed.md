It’s baffling to me that the world keeps turning, oblivious to the hellish week I have just endured.

Oblivious to the fact that we all scarcely survived the end of the world.

Oblivious to the fact that it may still end.

Following the events at the foot of that Parisian apartment, the bloody fragments of Blueman and the shattered cultists inexplicably turned to ash and were brushed upwards by the breeze. That dusty tempest beat against my skin, sticking those specks of people tightly to my fearful, paralysed body—a reminder of what I’d done. A reminder of the evil coursing through my veins.

Something haunting that possessed me.

I knew that I should keep moving. Should burn through my meagre funds, travelling as far as I could in any direction, so as to not be found again—so as to become someone other than Charlie. Someone other than Adam: the harbinger of the apocalypse for whom the Old Collective was searching.

But I didn’t have the stomach to truly leave it all behind.

I wanted to go home.

I felt alone and exposed. Felt stalked, as ever, by eyes only human on the surface.

At the age of twenty, having lived and studied as a university student for two years, I had long thought myself to be a grown-up. To be strong and independent. However, facing nightmares beyond myself had unveiled the truth—that I was, beneath it all, still a child.

And though I tried, I couldn’t help myself. I reverted back to being a boy desperate for his mother and father.

So, I did exactly what the Old Collective expected of me. I took a flight home. And I was very nearly lulled into a false sense of security at Beauvais Airport—by the crowds of everyday people, nattering and chattering about trivial things; but triviality was a coddling blanket, as it tricked me back into my old self—the one who didn’t believe in forces higher than ourselves. The one who believed only in the very grounded and very real world we all see with our eyes.

It must’ve been a trauma response to the terrifying things I had seen and endured in Paris.

By the time I landed in Manchester, I was *blindly* eager to see my parents. All thought of danger had fled my mind. All I thought was that they must’ve been worried sick about me for the past few days. That they may well have been home from the hospital already—sitting at home, awaiting my return.

*They didn’t call*, I reminded myself.

That might’ve been a cause for concern, had I been thinking clearly.

But when the nurses and doctors at the local hospital told me that no-one by the name of my father had been admitted within the past week, I felt a pang of fear. The mental alarm bells startled to toll quietly, clanging in a near-inaudible rhythm.

Still, I tried my damnedest to ignore my mind, screaming at me to *RUN*, and decided, instead, to escalate the matter. I asked to talk to somebody about the ambulance service’s records, as a vehicle had very clearly been dispatched to my street—I’d heard the siren as I fled. They found a record of my mother’s 999 call. Found a member of staff who’d been dispatched to the street. But—

“Nobody was there,” the paramedic explained. “We knocked on the door, then tried to access the property, and finally called the fire department to assist. But when we searched your house, we found neither your mother nor father. They may well face legal action for the false call, so—”

“It wasn’t a false call,” I interrupted breathlessly. “They should’ve been there… They…”

“Weren’t you with them?” asked the paramedic.

I gulped, then lied. “I… went out to the shop when Mum called me.”

“Then you waited two days to come to the hospital looking for your father?” the paramedic asked, eyes narrowing suspiciously.

I shook my head then started backing away, not looking to find myself in any sort of trouble—for all I knew, eyes were watching me. The news of my parents’ disappearance had woken up something in me. Had reminded me of the very present danger encroaching from all sides, suffocating me.

“I have to… find them,” I hoarsely croaked, turning on my heel and quickly striding away before the paramedic could probe any deeper into the odd turn of events.

I left the building, eyes stinging with a starting set of teardrops; I was moments away from bursting into full-blown bawling. But then I was overcome by a sudden sense of purpose—a sudden idea, to be exact. The Old Collective had my parents, and I knew how to find them. But I would have to face one of my oldest fears.

I took a long taxi ride to Cheshire, and was dropped off at Styal Prison. An ominous cluster of buildings, in the sense that they appeared more like haunted houses than the wards of a penitentiary. Red-bricked, two-storey buildings with stunted chimneys.

Only the sign gave away that I had stumbled not into a residential street but a prison:

>***Welcome to HMP & YOI Styal***

>Building Hope

>Changing Lives

And the inmate I had come to visit was, as I’m sure you’ve deduced, my old Religious Education teacher: Miss Black.

The woman who attempted to steal me from the world as a child.

“Has she had many visitors over the past six years?” I asked.

“No,” the officer bluntly replied.

And that was the end of the conversation.

The prison officer led me down dimly-lit corridors in one of the smaller buildings. I looked out of the windows, but sunshine did nothing to cut through the gloom of the place.

I had seen many friendly faces in the prison—inmates and officers alike. But this particular man was the first who seemed cold and distant. I had the strangest feeling that it had something to do with the woman he was taking me to visit.

“Might I ask why we won’t be talking in the visitor’s centre?” I asked politely as the man stopped in front of a particular door, shaky fingers around the door handle.

“We bend the rules for her,” he whispered, voice nearly cracking. “It’s better for everyone when she stays in here.”

As the prison officer unlocked the door, I turned a little pale and barked, “Wait!”

He sighed and turned to face me. “What?”

“I…” I started, shivering. “I don’t know about this.”

And the man simply nodded, as if fully understanding. “Do you want me to lock this door? I should. I should lock it, then you should go home and never come back here.”

The prison officer extended his free hand towards me, possibly to comfortingly pat me on the shoulder, but I retreated with wide, fearful eyes, remembering what had happened when Blueman’s skin met mine. I had a horrifying flashback of his body overflowing with piping hot blood, moments before his flesh burst completely.

I didn’t want to risk touching another person again—didn’t want to risk even thinking of another person, as I’d somehow fated the cultists to the same ends by merely letting our minds connect.

I realised I had no control of the thing hiding within me.

Or, perhaps more terribly, that thing had all of the control.

I keep thinking that, perhaps, Adam has always been the real child. As far as I know, *I* am the being hitching a ride in a demonic creature.

Anyhow, the prison officer seemed startled by my fearful, retreating reflex, but he quickly returned his hand to his side.

“Why?” I whispered, infected by the man’s contagious terror. “Why are you so afraid of her?”

He said, “Because bad things happen to people who so much as look at her. Things I don’t know how to explain. Deaths, maims, and other nightmares that she couldn’t have possibly have caused, but she is somehow always to blame—we all feel it, so we all stay away from her.

“It’s happened time and time again to inmates and officers; they go back to their cells, or homes, then they suffer horrible fates. And it’ll happen to you too, kid. So, I’ll ask you one more time: do you want me to lock this door?”

I shook my head, and the officer offered me a pitying look, then a head nod. He flung the door open and stepped back, shakily motioning for me to step inside. He mumbled something about me hollering for him if necessary, but there was a pleading tone to his voice.

*I beg of you, kid, don’t holler for me; don’t make me go in there with her.*

Miss Black sat on the bottom bunk of her two-person room which, through a series of horrifying supernatural events, she had snagged for herself. Undoubtedly, given the prison officer’s story, nobody would want to share a cell with such a haunting woman.

There was nothing comforting about seeing her with greying locks of hair, and tired eyes winged with crow’s feet. Age had not weakened her in my eyes. If anything, it only afforded greater depths of wisdom and nightmarish power. Made her somehow less human in my eyes.

“Adam…?” Miss Black whispered, meeting my gaze with teary eyes and a jubilant smile. “You came back to me… To us… As foretold.”

I shuddered in horror at those two final words. I had come there of my own free will—my own volition. I’d been certain of that. But Miss Black made me doubt everything. Instilled me with dread greater than even that of my fourteen-year-old self. I felt lesser than I had on that day, with my schoolmates calling for Mr Alton to save me—

Because I was alone this time.

“Where are my parents?” I wheezed.

“The defectors?” Miss Black asked. “I have heard stories of them. Heard stories of you. When you were born, we travelled from far and wide, from all corners of the Earth, to see you. But I was not blessed to—”

“Please,” I begged. “They’re gone, and I need them.”

“*They abandoned you?*” Miss Black hissed, brows suddenly lowering and gentle demeanour turning dark; it almost felt as if the sun had dimmed beyond her barred glass pane. “They defected from us. And they defected from you. They will pay when the crescent moon comes. When you rise to your fullest.”

My lips quivered. “Please… You have to know something. Where are they?”

The woman smiled. “I am but one of many. Look at me, rotting away in this cage. The Old Ones have not come to collect me, have they? I don’t know why you would imagine that I know a thing about your filthy abductors.”

“*THEY’RE MY PARENTS!*” I screamed at the woman, fists clenching and eyes burning—with neither tears, nor rage, but something I didn’t understand.

She smiled widely, and I saw a glint of red in her eyes, but it didn’t come from her.

It was a reflection of my *own* scorching pupils.

I unclenched my fists and stumbled backwards, moaning in abject fear at whatever I’d just experienced. Whatever I’d felt burgeoning within me, threatening to bubble to the surface. I felt the red flit away from my retinas, but it was still there, lurking behind them—lurking deep within me.

And no matter how lovingly Miss Black looked at me, I knew that I wasn’t the chosen one at all.

I was a vessel for something deeper and darker that had been hibernating within me for twenty years.

Something on the verge of coming out.

Of replacing me.

“You are so nearly ready,” she giggled tearfully.

I gulped and turned. “I’m leaving now…”

“*WAIT!*” she screeched, halting me in my tracks. “I’ll help you… I’m connected to the Old Collective. I’m sure they will know what happened to your… *mother and father*.”

Those last three words were practically spat out of Miss Black’s mouth, as if they’d tasted sour and poisonous on her tongue. I knew she was fooling me somehow. Knew that, given her desperation for me to stay, I should leave even more hurriedly—should be doing whatever possible to not give her what she wanted.

But I needed Mum and Dad.

I turned and nodded. “Please.”

She smiled. “As you will it, Adam. *Blessed be*.”

When she opened her mouth, I expected words to come out. Some ritualistic chanting in a foreign language. Something that would summon her fellow cultists to the prison. Instead, however, her mouth kept opening. Wider and wider, in both height and width.

And my own lips could only open so far as I screamed at the impossibility before me.

Screamed as her lips widened to fill the whole room.

Widened and barrelled towards me.

I banged feverishly on the door, shrieking at the top of my lungs for the prison officer to let me out. But either he’d scarpered from the scene or Miss Black had already swept me away from that world.

And then I fell into her blackened maw, shrieking until my vocal cords gave out.

Then came blinding white from the black, and when I rubbed my eyes, my vision eventually adjusted to the blazing sun above. To the blue and yellow above—to the green below. I felt grass scratching my skin and sat up, immediately feeling a lurch in my gut. I recognised that place.

It was the field from the photograph in my parents’ attic.

*I had returned home.*

And not spiritually. Not in some vision that Miss Black had cast. She had, impossibly, flung my body from that cell in Styal Prison to a distant rural land. The land in which I had been born. The land to which pilgrims of the Old Collective had fled from across the world to see me. Their chosen one.

Their bringer of humanity’s end.

“*CHARLIE!*” screamed a voice from behind me.

I shot to my feet and spun to see a horrifying sight.

Swaying upside down from the upper beam of a wooden structure, shaped like a football goalpost, were my parents, bound by their ankles. And behind them, in a group of twenty or thirty, stood members of the Old Collective.

“He has returned to us!” cried a shrill voice from the crowd.

“Yes. Sister Black shall be rewarded,” came a deeper voice.

“*RUN, CHARLIE!*” my mum begged a second time.

She was silenced by a swift thump to the head with one man’s wooden stick.

“Please!” I begged, staggering forwards through the grass. “Just let my parents go.”

“Your parents?” came a woman’s voice from the crowd.

And then they emerged. The blonde couple from the photo. Of course, twenty years later, their hair bore quite a few white strands, but they were unmistakeably the two who had been holding the baby in the picture.

I felt sick.

“Adam,” the man whispered. “We have spent two decades searching for you. Our boy. Blessed be.”

“Blessed be,” his wife blubbered.

The two walked, hand in hand, towards me, and I cast my eyes to my true parents, swinging upside down from the wooden beam—not the ones who created me, but the ones who raised me. The ones who saved me from this nightmare.

“Please…” I begged the blonde couple in fear, then I forced out the words, “Mum and Dad.”

I let them embrace me, as terrified as I felt. Their skin didn’t crack, and blood didn’t spill loose, which only filled me with hellish questions.

Why wasn’t Blueman spared the same fate?

*And what am I?*

“Our son,” my biological father whispered into my fear as the pair squeezed me more tightly.

I shivered, realising that our minds were connected. That he could read my every thought and desire.

That he knew I was lying.

That I didn’t see them as Mother and Father.

That I didn’t care about the Old Collective, and I’d burn it all down to save my real parents.

What horrified me above all else was that they didn’t seem to care. Not a single member of that cult. This only made me fear that they, much like the nightmare dwelling within my body, held all of the cards—held the true power in the scenario.

And that I, Charlie, would die as soon as the time had come. As soon as I had become—

“*Ripe*,” my biological mother whispered tearfully in my other ear. “You are so nearly there, Adam.”

“I’m Charlie…” I sniffled.

And then their hands dug more deeply into my flesh.

I tried to scream, but something held my tongue.

That thing within.

“*YOU ARE ADAM*,” the blonde man hissed. “*CHARLIE IS A LIE THAT WILL DIE UNDER THE CRESCENT MOON*.”

“Soon, my darling,” his wife whispered as the pair pulled away from me. “Blessed be.”

The man sighed, eyeing me softly again. “Blessed be.”

“What do I have to do to free them?” I asked, watching my teary-eyed parents squirm in their restraints. “Who is in charge?”

My cult mother smiled. “The Crescent Moon.”

To add emphasis to this answer, my cult father thrust his finger towards my chest, and I looked down, feeling a jolt course across my skin and through my core. I felt it behind my ribcage. The irregularity. The *dum, ba-ba-dum, dum, ba-ba-dum*—like the beat of a drum, not a heart. We are not built to be conscious of own organs. Our own innards. But my biological father had made me, with the touch of his finger, so horribly, horribly aware of my inner cogs.

*Of my crescent-shaped heart.*

There came chest pain, and I looked down to see something pressing through my chest—pressing through the fabric of my shirt.

A half-moon outline.

I fell to my knees in the grass, hyperventilating as I realised that the members of the Old Collective weren’t waiting for a crescent moon in the sky.

The Crescent Moon was me.

The heart within me.

The living thing waiting to awaken.

*Waiting to ripen.*

“Charlie is a lie,” the blonde man reiterated more softly. “You will come to understand that, Adam, when you, like the rest of us, bow to the Crescent Moon. But we must help you along, boy, for you have been led astray for too many years by these blasphemers.”

My biological father took a few purposeful strides towards my mother and father swaying in the air.

“Go to hell,” my true dad growled.

The blonde man chuckled. “I’ll show you the afterlife of the one true religion, sinner.”

My biological mother offered me what almost appeared to be empathy. “We are sorry for this, Adam.”

Then the cultist, in one swift motion, drew a blade from his belt and ran it across my father’s throat.

My mother and I screamed in unison as a river of red ran out of the wound, spilling over my father’s spluttering mouth.

A moment later, the cultist ran that same blade through the flesh of my mother’s throat.

I wailed in agony, watching my true parents wriggle in the restraints as the blood drained from their still-alive bodies. But it didn’t take long for my father to stop moving. And my mother, desperately trying to mouth some words to me with her dying lips, eventually hung still too.

“And now,” my biological father announced, turning to face me. “It is time to drain you, Adam.”

As the man walked towards me, wielding that blood-stained blade, I felt fear grip every inch of my body. Fear beyond anything primal. Fear existential, as I questioned what would become of me after my throat had been slit and my body had been exsanguinated.

*Would my body rise again as something else?*

I clutched my temples and closed my eyes, trying to ignore the fear in my heart as the man’s feet squelched against the grass and my horrifying end approached.

And then I saw them in my mind’s eye.

The faces of the cultists standing in that field, watching me from the execution site.

Watching my father walk towards me.

Within my mind, I reached out and touched them all.

It was an act of self-defence, and rage, and sorrow. I kept my eyes closed as the screaming started, but I saw the horror behind closed eyes. Saw it through our accursed spiritual connection. The cracking skin fissures, letting blood run free, then the shattering of the bodies one by one.

Only my biological mother and father remained, lying in the grass, when I opened my eyes.

I towered over them, resisting the urge to let that hate flare in my pupils—the redness that I’d seen reflected in Miss Black’s own eyes. But it was too late. As my blonde parents clung to their last moments of life, skin cracking and steaming blood spilling free, they both smiled at me.

“Blessed be,” croaked my mother. “With this act, you have… prepared yourself for the harvest.”

She shattered, and my father didn’t even flinch—didn’t let their smile waver for a second.

“Ripe,” he croaked as his very lips began to fragment, and his body began to fall apart. “*One more time, Adam*.”

And then I was left standing again in an empty field, accompanied only by a gust of ash in the air and my true parents’ pale corpses hanging from a wooden beam.

But the true horror survived within my chest—that crescent-shaped abomination, with a life of its own, threatening to break free.

Threatening, next time, to connect with every last person on Earth, turning them all to ash and leaving me as the last thing alive.

*One more time, Adam.*

I understand now. With every tap into that thing within me, I have made it stronger. Have brought it closer to fully taking the reins. Mum and Dad were shielding me from myself, hoping I would never unlock that part of me. That I would never become what the Old Collective had *made* me to be.

I don’t know how they woke up. Became human again and left the Old Collective behind, taking me with them. But I have to believe that the same can be achieved by others across the world, for they are many. So, so many. And that terrifies me.

Please, I beg of any members reading this, see sense. Stop this nightmare.

Don’t let that thing take me.
