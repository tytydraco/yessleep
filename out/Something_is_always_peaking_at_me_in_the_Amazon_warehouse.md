I never expected to get a job at an Amazon warehouse during the holidays. I wasn’t even looking for work, but after being short of gift money, and hearing a friend talk about the decent pay, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to give it a shot. They needed seasonal help, and my application was accepted almost immediately. It didn’t take long to adjust to the routine, pick the items, scan them, package them, and repeat. Simple enough. But something about that warehouse…

It was more than just the constant hum of machinery or the dry, sterile cardboard box-smelling air that made the place feel off. It was the way the lights flickered in certain parts of the building, like they were struggling to stay on, and the eerie, echoing silence when you ventured too far down the aisles. It was never fully quiet, but the hum seemed to settle into a sort of muffled thrum when you were working in the farthest reaches of the rows of shelves.

I was working the 3-to-11 shift, the shift that ensures you have no life, and you’re running on fumes by the end. My days blurred together. There was no time for much else but the work and the rush of getting orders out before the end of the shift.

On the first night, I noticed something odd. I was walking down an aisle, pushing my cart filled with picked orders, when I thought I saw a movement from the corner of my eye. A figure, barely there, retreating behind one of the towering stacks of packages. At first, I chalked it up to fatigue. You get tired after hours of the same monotonous tasks, and the lights in the warehouse did their part to distort things in the periphery. But the next time I was down that aisle, I saw it again.

A figure. Just out of sight, peaking around the corner of a shelf. I couldn’t make out details, but it was too… deliberate. Too calculated. Almost like it was waiting for me to come down the aisle, only to dart back just out of view.

“Probably just another worker,” I muttered to myself. “Get a grip.”

But as the days went by, it became harder to shake the feeling that something was following me. It wasn’t just the quick glimpses of movement anymore, it was the odd, uncomfortable sensation that I was being watched. I’d turn corners, and for a split second, I’d catch a shadow peeking around the edge of the shelving units, as if it were waiting for me to come closer. The moments were brief, but they were enough to make me question myself. Was it my mind playing tricks? Or was I really being watched?

The warehouse was massive and was probably a hundred other workers. At first, I thought it might be one of my coworkers, playing some sort of prank. There was a sort of camaraderie that came with the hours we worked, the jokes we shared, and the occasional quiet moments between picking orders. But the people I worked with didn’t strike me as the type for childish games. Besides, why would they target me?

I decided to confront it.

The next time I spotted the shadow, I didn’t look away. I didn’t pretend I hadn’t seen it. Instead, I walked directly toward the spot where the figure had ducked behind a shelf. I rounded the corner with a firm step, expecting to catch someone in the act. But when I looked, the aisle was empty.

I frowned. My heart pounded in my chest. As I looked at the empty spot, I heard a small skittering behind me, almost like the patter of mouse feet. When I turned around, I caught the very edge of the figure again, ducking behind a shelf.

For the rest of that night, I couldn’t shake the feeling of eyes on me. No matter how I tried to focus on the work, I couldn’t help but look over my shoulder. Every time I walked down an aisle, I half-expected to see someone peeking from the end, waiting, watching. But it never happened again, at least not in the open. It always happened just on the edge of my vision, almost like whatever it was, was adjusting their pace to match mine, to always stay in my peripheral vision.

It was subtle. A soft scrape of feet against the concrete floors, just beyond where I could see. Sometimes, I’d hear breathing, shallow and almost labored, coming from the darkened aisles. I’d stop. I’d listen. The noise would always stop the moment I did, as if it were waiting for me to continue moving forward.

By the end of my first week, I couldn’t deny it anymore: something was in that warehouse with me. The feeling of being followed became unbearable. My mind was on edge, my nerves shot from hours of creeping unease. I’d hear the shuffle of feet behind me, but I’d turn, and no one would be there. I’d catch glimpses of movement, someone darting behind a corner, or a flicker of shadow in a dimly lit aisle.

I tried telling my manager. His response was dismissive, “It’s just the shift hours getting to you. The building’s huge. You’re just working yourself up.”

But as the days turned into weeks, it only got worse.

The strange occurrences intensified. The peeking stopped being subtle. One night, I was deep in the warehouse, near the back row of shelves, when I saw something, or someone, standing at the far end, clearly visible now. The figure was taller than any worker I had seen, with a pale face peering out from behind a shelf. I could see its eyes, wide and glassy, staring directly at me. I froze.

I couldn’t move. My body wouldn’t respond. It was like the figure was pulling me toward it, like it had a gravitational pull I couldn’t escape. Then, just as quickly as it had appeared, it vanished. The figure wasn’t there anymore. No sound. No movement. Just silence.

I should have run, but I couldn’t make my legs move. My heart pounded in my chest, and I could feel the sweat collecting on my back. I walked away slowly, not looking back, knowing that whatever I had seen was not something I was meant to confront.

The next morning, I tried to shake it off, but it was impossible. I was rattled, to the point where I could barely focus on the work. I kept thinking of the eyes staring at me in the dark, the unnatural stillness in the aisle. That was the moment I realized I wasn’t imagining it anymore. Something was there. And it wasn’t just watching me, it was stalking me.

By the end of the week, I couldn't take it anymore. I quit. My manager asked me if I would be willing to work one more shift, Saturday night, before I left. He had always been cool, so out of guilt, I agreed.

As I trudged back into the warehouse that night, I could feel the weight of something far heavier than exhaustion. There was a quiet dread gnawing at the back of my mind, a feeling that this place didn’t want me here anymore. Still, I pushed it down. I could handle it.

At least, that’s what I told myself.

The shift started uneventfully, the constant drone of forklifts and the soft hum of the overhead lights mingling together like white noise. My pick list was unusually light that night, mostly small orders that didn’t take long to grab. Most of the other workers were scattered across the warehouse, their figures moving like shadows between towering shelves and aisles. The place felt emptier tonight than it had before. Quiet.

I had to pick an item from the far end of the warehouse, one of the isolated aisles in the corner. The part of the warehouse far from the main foot traffic, lit only by a few weak, flickering lights. It wasn’t that far from my usual routes, but the longer I worked there, the more I noticed how different this part of the warehouse felt. It was colder, darker. The air seemed heavier, somehow.

I took a deep breath as I wheeled my cart toward the far aisle. The lights overhead flickered, buzzing erratically before going steady again.

The aisle stretched long ahead of me, stacks of boxes lining the walls. There was nothing but the sound of my shoes scraping against the concrete and the rhythmic clicking of the scanner as I went down the row, looking for the item on my list.

Then, I heard it.

A soft skittering sound. Like nails or claws scraping against the floor. I froze. My heart skipped, the hairs on the back of my neck standing at attention. It came from behind me, further down the aisle.

I swung around, scanning the shadows at the far end, but saw nothing. My breath caught in my chest as I waited for another sound. But the aisle was empty.

Nothing.

Maybe it was just a rat, I thought. The warehouse wasn’t exactly pristine, and it was filled with crates and old equipment. Animals had a way of getting in.

I turned back to my task, trying to shake off the chill creeping up my spine. But as I reached the end of the aisle, something felt… off. The warehouse felt too quiet. Too empty. The hairs on my arms stood up.

Then, the light above me flickered and died.

Darkness.

For a moment, I was still. My eyes adjusted to the dim glow of distant lights further down the warehouse. I turned my head, but I couldn’t see anything. The entire aisle had gone dark in an instant.

A low, cold dread pooled in my stomach.

Before I could react, the next light down the aisle flickered off.

Then another.

The darkness was creeping closer, like the slow advance of a tide. The lights above me, each one turning off in sequence, like a countdown. The darkness behind me was now eating its way toward me, consuming the aisle, step by step.

A cold breath ran down my spine. I turned, my chest tightening with a slow, creeping terror. I couldn’t see anything, but I could feel it.

Something was there.

At the far end of the aisle, just past the flickering lights, I saw it. A figure. Barely more than a silhouette against the darkened shelves. Standing. Still.

My heart pounded in my chest, every instinct screaming at me to run. But my legs wouldn’t move. I stood frozen, locked in place by the impossible sight before me.

The figure didn’t move at first. It just stood there, watching. But I could feel its presence, the weight of it, pressing against the back of my skull. Like it was waiting for me to make a move.

And the lights kept turning off. One after another. Until I was left in darkness, save for the fading glimmer at the far end.

My breath caught.

The figure took a step forward.

The lights closest to me flickered out.

It took another step. The darkness closed in like an unstoppable wave.

And then, the last light above me died. I was swallowed whole by the blackness.

The figure moved again, this time much closer. I could feel it, not with my eyes, but with every nerve in my body. It was there, in the shadows, just beyond my sight. The weight of its presence pressed against my skin, crawling into my bones.

I couldn’t take it anymore. Fear took hold of me. I dropped the package in my hand. I didn’t care. I didn’t care about the orders.

I turned and ran.

The sound of my footsteps echoed through the aisle as I sprinted toward the exit. Behind me, the sound of footsteps followed. Not the echo of my own, but something else. Closer. Too close.

I didn’t dare look back, but the sound of the footsteps behind me, faster now, rushing in pursuit, told me everything I needed to know. It was there. It was following me.

With each step I took, I heard the skittering sound again, closer now. The scrape of claws against the concrete. The soft thud of something too heavy to be human. I pushed myself harder, my lungs burning, my legs threatening to give out.

But the footsteps were still there. And getting closer.

My heart hammered against my ribs, my breath ragged and uneven as I finally reached the end of the aisle. The bright, artificial lights of the main warehouse stretched ahead of me, but the footsteps were so close now, I could feel the presence looming just behind. I barely dared to glance over my shoulder.

A shadow moved toward me, blocking the light.

I didn’t think, I just ran, arms flailing, the cold terror gripping my chest.

When I reached the end of the aisle, I turned a corner, and the footsteps stopped. Silence fell, deafening and absolute.

But the air felt different. The warehouse, once so full of mechanical hums and distant voices, was now still. Silent.

I stood there, panting, heart racing, waiting for something, anything, to happen.

But nothing did.

I didn’t wait to find out. I bolted for the exit. I didn’t stop running until I was out of the warehouse, standing on the cold concrete parking lot, gasping for air. I never went back. No more seasonal jobs.
