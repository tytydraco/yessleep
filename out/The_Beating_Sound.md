I haven’t been to work in two weeks, I’ve lied about being on vacation just to stay away not because I hate my job but because of what happened makes me terrified to go back. I can’t tell anyone, they wouldn’t believe me, and who would? It would sound like something an insane person would tell.

For context I work at a hospital, usually I’m assigned to work in the morgue. Most of the time I work in the daytime and even when it’s night I still have someone to assist me, well one afternoon my boss called me into his office. To put it shortly he asked me to work overtime with extra pay, it may have sounded stupid that I accepted but I had circumstances due to me being a single mother who needed more money to help my children. So I accepted without thinking about anything else except for my children who would have to stay over at my parents house for a lot longer than usual which I did inform my parents about who understood. 

Soon enough the day started to turn into night, most of my coworkers were either somewhere else or had clocked out for the night so I was alone in the morgue. My shift was almost over so I was gonna do the same after writing my report, as I finished I was about to leave, but then I heard it “Lub-dup, Lub-dup, Lub-dup, Lub-dup” I stopped and froze for a second hearing what sounded like a still beating heart I turned around and the sound stopped. I rolled my eyes as I thought it was a prank, I’m aware that sounds messed up but I have a coworker who does this type of stuff they’ve most likely put a speaker somewhere playing a beating heart audio.

So I turned back around to leave and heard it again “Lub-dup, Lub-dup, Lub-dup, Lub-dup” I banged my hand on the door to this, this is already pissing me off I could’ve just walked out but I already knew this coworker would have done the same shit twenty four seven every day until I found the damn speaker so I walked over to where the sound was coming from a drawer on the left. So I immediately opened it, but I didn’t find anything except for just one of the bodies that was examined.

“Lub-dup, Lub-dup, Lub-dup, Lub-dup” I heard it again but this time it was coming from a drawer on the right, my frustration now turned into confusion as I walked over to open it, but there was no speaker and the sound stopped as well, the beating started up again in a drawer on the bottom left. I didn’t waste any time with this one I rushed over and immediately opened it, with that my emotions changed completely, first it was frustration, then confusion, now it was complete and utter horror as I heard the beating coming from the deceased body.

I got up and started backing away, that’s when I heard the beating from multiple different angles. I was in complete and utter shock and fear that I couldn’t move, ironic since I always got annoyed when someone doesn’t immediately run in horror movies, now I understand why. However it started to get worse as they started to get rapidly faster and faster which made me freeze more. What made me finally snap out of it was when I saw the storage closet start slowly opening, that made me immediately run out of the morgue and I kept running until I got to a more populated area, everyone stared at me with a confused look but I didn’t say anything I simply handed my report and left the hospital.

The next day I told my boss I would be taking a three week vacation, although that was a lie but thankfully he believed it and thankfully I didn’t get put on overtime during the duration before my so called vacation. It’s been two weeks since then and my time is almost over. I’m scared of going back, I just pray to god it was just an elaborate prank, but I think that’s asking for too much however what’s not asking for too much is not wanting to know what would have happened if I stayed as the closet opened.
