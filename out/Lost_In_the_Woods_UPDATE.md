Hey everyone I made it to a road. Apparently it wouldn't send anywhere but reddit, that's fun. I saw somebody mention something about getting the GPS but I didn't see it til it didn't really matter. I'm at Gold Camp, but I still have a ways to go til I hit the bottom. 20 minute walk and another 7 hours to my house. Remind me to never go on another trip to the mountains again. I keep hearing a faint whistle just left of where I was walking. I've heard it for the past 8 hours I've been down this trail. 

I think I can see the sun trying to bust out from the mountain like a caged animal about to be freed. The whistling has only gotten worse. It's in the same spot but it's a little louder and more aggressive. Every step i take I hear the whistle follow. 

My legs are starting to give out. Hours of walking catch up to you and oh boy am I beyond my years. I would kill to be back to my former self. I tried to sit down but I started hearing twigs cracking, not one or two but 30 snapping at a time as I heard a huge rush of wind start pushing towards me. I got up and started running. 

I didn't see that rock. I tripped and fell right off the side. Hitting a huge rock with my knee and grabbing on to that, that's the only reason I'm alive honestly. My fingers are cut, my legs are weak and I don't know what's stalking me but I got to keep moving. I didn't make it almost down this mountain all this time to die. 

I don't really know what to do. I can't be on this phone forever because honestly it's at 65 percent and I can't afford it to die. Someone saw my post. Someone knows I'm here and now they know I'm at Old Stage Road in Colorado Springs, Colorado, 15 minutes away from the bottom and I'm trying to get past whatever thing is stalking me.

I heard a yell for help. A deep yell from the gut. I heard it close like it was in the trees just feet away from me so I booked it. I heard twigs snapping just before mine.

I saw the very faint outline of a cop car at the end of the trail. “He has a gun,” I thought. Protection is my biggest priority when it comes to dangerous situations. I was running and I tripped and the snapping stopped. I could hear the things bones cracking and moving? It sounded like the sound that happens when you high five someone really hard but everytime the thing shifted a bone around. 

I saw it's face. Its human features that were just uncanny enough to appear real but somethings off. The way his eyes twitch isn't right. It isn't human. The way it screams with its jaw unhinged is a sight I'll never forget. As I wrap this up I just want to say I am almost to the cop car but it's running on fours, we will see who's faster.
