In a time lost among the whispers of the wind in the mountains, where the shadows of clouds seemed to dance over a grayish, almost monochromatic village, this story unfolded. It was a place where days seemed to last eternities, and the nights, wrapped in overwhelming silence, hid secrets few dared to mention. This village, isolated among hills, appeared to be trapped in a time that didn’t belong.

Elizabeth, a young housewife with a face marked by pain and resignation, had endured a lifelong torment of menstrual agony. Each cycle was an ordeal: heavy bleeding, stabbing pain that shot down her legs and back, and a fatigue that drained her very essence. One day, her body could bear no more, and she collapsed in the middle of her home. With no doctors nearby, her father took her to the only person who could offer any hope: the village healer.

The healer’s house exuded an unsettling atmosphere. Small and dark, it smelled of dried herbs and melted wax. Upon entering, Elizabeth felt the air grow heavier, as if the house itself breathed her pain. The old woman looked at her with glassy eyes, eyes that seemed to see beyond the visible. After examining her, she uttered words that seemed to freeze time:  
—“You will never be able to have children, Elizabeth. If you try, both you and the child will die.”

The warning echoed coldly in Elizabeth’s mind. In that place and time, being a mother was not just a desire; it was a social obligation. Women who could not conceive were seen with disdain, almost as a curse upon their families. She left the healer’s house with a pale face and a vacant expression. Her father waited by the village fountain, and when their eyes met, he understood the gravity of the diagnosis. Without words, he embraced her, and together they wept under the cloudy sky.

Her father, however, was not willing to accept such a fate. The next day, he visited Father Cristóbal, who, with a serene smile and a solemn tone, told him:  
—“In God’s hands, all is possible. Have faith, and blessings will come.”

Meanwhile, Elizabeth sought solace in her pain from the only person who seemed to understand her: Ignacio. Her love, the cobbler’s son, with whom she dreamed of building a family. When she told him what the healer had said, Ignacio was initially paralyzed. But the rigidity on his face soon gave way to an expression hard to decipher: a mixture of restrained anger and calculating determination. His soft voice reassured Elizabeth that everything would be fine, that their love didn’t need children to survive. Yet deep inside, his mind was plotting something entirely different.

In time, Elizabeth returned to the healer, seeking a way to avoid any chance of pregnancy. She didn’t want to tempt fate. The healer handed her a small pouch filled with herbs wrapped in worn threads. She explained that Elizabeth must prepare an infusion after every intimate encounter with Ignacio. Trusting the healer’s words, Elizabeth followed the instructions. What she didn’t know was that Ignacio, with his cunning and dark mind, had other plans.

That very night, as Elizabeth slept, Ignacio inspected the herbs carefully. He recognized the plants and replaced them with others, identical in appearance but completely ineffective as contraceptives. His mind justified the deception: his lineage, his future, everything depended on having a child.

Weeks later, the symptoms began. Elizabeth woke up with nausea, cramps, and inexplicable cravings. Ignacio, observing every detail with anxious anticipation, could not hide his joy when Elizabeth tearfully confessed her suspicion of being pregnant. Ignacio assured her that everything would be fine, that this was a miracle from God. But in Elizabeth’s heart, a dark foreboding stirred—a cold whisper that mingled with the nocturnal chirping of crickets.

When they finally shared the news with their families, the reactions echoed the fears and desires of the village. Elizabeth’s mother cried with joy, while her father looked on with silent concern. Ignacio’s parents, though pleased by the news of a future grandchild, made no effort to hide their disdain for Elizabeth. If she were to die, like many other women, it would be nothing more than a necessary sacrifice.

As the weeks passed, Elizabeth’s health deteriorated. One night, Ignacio awoke to his wife’s piercing screams. The bed was soaked in blood. Desperate, he carried her under the pale moonlight to the healer’s house. When the door opened, the old woman looked at him with unmistakable terror. After stopping the hemorrhage, the healer confronted him.  
—“There is something you’re not telling me, Ignacio,” she whispered with a piercing gaze. “Take care of her, or you will regret it for the rest of your life.”

But Ignacio, far from feeling intimidated, simply smiled. In his mind, there was no turning back.

To everyone’s surprise, the pregnancy progressed normally, and each night, Ignacio and Elizabeth gave thanks to God for the life growing in her womb. Despite the initial fears, the child was born healthy and strong. They loved him as they had never loved anyone, with a devotion so deep it bordered on obsession. To them, their son was perfect. Untouchable.

But perfection crumbled over time. As the boy grew, he began to exhibit strange behavior. His words turned harsh, his gestures rough, and his relationship with Elizabeth took on a disturbing undertone. He spent more time with her than with Ignacio, and perhaps for that reason, his outbursts seemed directed solely at his mother. At first, they were violent games, then tantrums… but soon, the attacks carried something darker. They weren’t mere fits of anger; they were assaults filled with… malice. Elizabeth never admitted it, but those attacks terrified her. Even so, each time the boy calmed down, she would stroke his face tenderly, ignoring the tears streaming down her cheeks. He was her son, her life, and she couldn’t see him as anything else.

The village fell into darkness when an ancient illness returned as if by punishment. Smallpox swept through the young and the weak. Their son, their treasure, was one of the first to succumb. They buried him under the gray sky, their hearts shattered in a silence that seemed eternal. But the real horror was just beginning.

A week later, Elizabeth returned to the cemetery. She knew the path by heart, every curve, every stone. But when she arrived at her son’s grave, a scream escaped her throat. From the earth protruded a small hand. Pale, damp, rigid as though it belonged to a broken doll. Elizabeth checked the name on the tombstone repeatedly. Yes, it was her son. But… how was this possible? Her heart pounding violently, she took the small, cold hand and, between sobs, covered it with earth again. “Rest, my love,” she whispered before leaving. But peace didn’t come.

Days later, Elizabeth returned to the cemetery, driven by an unease that wouldn’t let her sleep. There it was again. Her son’s hand emerged from the grave, as if seeking air, as if pleading for release. Pale, dry, and even more terrifying than before. The scene repeated itself three, four times. Each time, Elizabeth buried the hand with increasing desperation, but the cycle continued. Her son could not rest.

Finally, in her desperation, she went to the village priest. She recounted what had happened in a trembling voice, initially omitting details but eventually confessing the blows her son had inflicted on her in life. The priest, with a stern gaze, opened his Bible to a passage that resonated like a sentence: *“Honor your father and mother.”* He explained that her son, in his rebellion and violence, had broken this commandment, and his soul would find no rest until the debt was settled.  
—“But you failed too,” the priest said. “Out of love, you ignored your duties as a mother. Now, you must reprimand him… even in death.”

The priest handed her a stick of rosewood covered in thorns and instructed her to strike her son’s hand every time it emerged from the ground. Elizabeth initially refused; the thought was unthinkable, cruel. But the nights became a living hell; her dreams filled with whispers and childish laughter that turned into screams. Finally, with no other choice, she returned to the cemetery, stick in hand.

When she saw her son’s hand emerging once again, her body trembled. Through tears, she raised the thorny stick and delivered the first blow. The pale skin tore, but the hand didn’t retreat. Elizabeth collapsed to her knees, crying as she struck again and again. With each blow, she felt herself sinking deeper into an abyss of guilt and horror. The routine continued for weeks. Elizabeth exhausted every rose in her garden, cutting them with trembling hands to craft new instruments of punishment. Each visit to the cemetery was torment, but little by little, the hand stopped appearing.

Finally, one night, Elizabeth went to the cemetery and found the grave undisturbed. The earth was firm, showing no signs of disturbance. Her son had finally found rest. But Elizabeth had not. Each time she closed her eyes, she felt the weight of the stick in her hands and heard the echo of the blows against the grave.

She had fulfilled her role as a mother, but the price was her soul.

This is an old story passed down as legend in my grandparents' village. I will never tire of saying that in the past, and especially in rural areas, the things people witnessed, the things that happened… they were different, as if the countryside was a refuge for the things we cannot understand.
