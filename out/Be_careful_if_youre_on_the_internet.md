I’m a small content creator, I don’t have many followers and don’t get paid much. Sometimes I’m lucky if I get a brand deal but usually it’s unpaid and I get free things very rarely. Yet the thing about being on the internet is well anyone can find you if they tried… and that’s exactly what happened. 

It started with an old friend messaging me on Instagram. They wanted to meet up and have a few drinks. I was over the moon to catch up with an old friend. We decided to go to a local bar but as soon as I got there they ghosted me. I told them I was there, and tried calling, but heard nothing. I was alone and feeling embarrassed. I spent good money on Uber to get there because I don’t like to drive if I’m drinking. I started scrolling my phone checking the weather and my email. 

Then a group of women noticed I was alone and invited me to join them. However, I watch a lot of crime documentaries and grew up on Investigation Discovery Channel. I had a bad feeling and decided to call another friend who lived close to the bar to join me. She was in the military and was not one to be messed with. She worked in security before and I trusted my life with her. Thank god I did. She kept me safe throughout the night and eventually the girls that once wanted me to join them left and did their own thing. 

I thought that was that. Until I got a text a few weeks later. For privacy, I will call her Sarah. She started to text me saying she wanted to catch up and that she got a new number. She even sent a picture of herself in the chat. Yet over time, the conversation took a turn. It started becoming more sexual and then she texted me she wanted to hang out with me alone. Now my friends and I are open about our sex lives but my friend “Sarah” never has been. I started to get an uneasy feeling as I realized she wouldn’t talk to me like this. It was even more odd she wanted to hang alone. For backstory “Sarah” usually hangs out with her longtime friend “Kacey” (protecting her name as well) and they are inseparable. That’s how I knew something was very wrong. 

I immediately texted “Sarah” on messenger. She told me she never got a new phone number and that wasn’t her. My stomach sank. Who was I talking to? I tried calling out the person who texted me pretending to be “Sarah” but they never replied. I deleted the message and reported the conversation as spam. I was so freaked out I didn’t want to look back at it. 

I thought it was over until a few months later I got a new text message. It was someone I was an acquaintance with but we weren’t super close. I knew her bf and we went to elementary school together. Yet we weren’t besties by any means. She even sent a picture of herself and wanted to catch up. I started talking to her and venting to her. Yet this person didn’t sound like her and honestly what rang alarm bells is she wouldn’t be this friendly to me after a fall out with her bf and friends. I left that group of friends a few days before due to some unhealthy friendship dynamics and I didn’t want to be a part of that friend group anymore. Something seemed off though as we chatted more. She was so kind to me but she wanted to catch up and hang out alone. Then I realized I’d seen this before… This wasn’t her. This was the same person who had contacted me before pretending to be someone I knew. 

I immediately blocked the number, deleted the chat out of fear, and went about my night. Sometimes to this day, I get a “Hey!” text but I know to never respond to an unknown number again. This person somehow knew people I was close to and would pose as them, all just so they could try to get me to hang out with them alone.

It’s terrifying, and sometimes I wonder who that stranger is but I hope to never meet them. Yet I’m grateful for that night my friend did show up to the bar because I think that was the first time they almost got me alone. 

So with all this being said. Be careful if you’re a content creator.
