I’ve had recurring dreams my whole life. It’s pitch black, but every few seconds, thousands of red lights pulse against the horizon. Like a warning. They’re aviation obstruction lights, flashing from the top of massive wind turbines so pilots don’t fly too low. I’ve been running for miles. My legs are heavy and tired, and I want to stop, but then I hear something behind me: an insectile buzz that builds and builds until it’s a high-pitched scream. So I keep running.



I always knew I was running for my life in these nightmares, but I never knew why. Until I saw them.



I go to college in Houston now. But when I fall asleep, these nightmares spit me right back out onto the plains of the Texas Panhandle. It’s where I grew up, and it’s where the events of my story unfold. Here’s what you need to know about the Panhandle: There’s a lot of tornadoes, a lot of old people, and not a ton else. If you also grew up in a small town, you probably know that in the absence of excitement, people create it. They gossip. They get really invested in high school football. And they tell ghost stories.



I used to work at the pharmacy-slash-hamburger-counter on Main Street after school. My boss there, Burton Beardon, did all three of those things. Burton told me that late one night after closing up, she saw a beautiful dark-haired woman in a white nightgown staring at her from across the road. A sleepwalker? But then Burton saw that the woman’s front was soaked in red. Burton started to say something, but then the woman opened her mouth, and a strange, mangled hum came out. Like a swarm of mosquitos in her stomach, trying to escape. Burton screamed and the woman disappeared into the darkness. It was a ghost! Burton swore to it. But Burton also swore she was going to be a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader until the jealous wife of her ex-lover poisoned her Gatorade, sabotaging her final round audition in 1987. And everybody knew that wasn’t true. I thought about Burton’s story, about the woman in white who sounded like my nightmares. 



But I told myself Burton must’ve imagined it – made a scrap of white fabric or a tree’s shadow into a ghost. I was used to people turning harmless things scary in their heads. Like my dad. He had an accident when I was a toddler, and it left his face covered in lumpy red scars. People used to stare at him because he was a rodeo star, and then they stared at him because he was ugly.



The story of the accident is important to my story. I’ll tell it now, so you understand everything that happened after. There was a milk-white bull named Young Gun – “Gunner.” Gunner was the highest ranked bull in the pro rodeo circuit. Out of the eighty or so riders who had mounted him over two years, only four had stayed on for eight seconds – the time required for a ride to qualify. Those four riders were cocky, but they weren’t anything special. Sometimes Gunner got moody and refused to perform. Those riders had simply gotten lucky.



Just like Gunner was the highest ranked bull that year, my dad was the highest ranked rider. And he *was* something special. He drew Gunner at the national finals. He was a little nervous, but mostly excited. Drawing a nasty bull is a good thing. More and bigger bucks and kicks mean more opportunities to score points. So my dad knew that if he could just hang on as Gunner tried like hell to throw him off, he’d be the national champion. The purse was a million dollars. Life changing money. 



All he had to do was hold on for eight seconds.



My mom apparently wasn’t excited at all. She was just nervous. She’s been nervous as long as I’ve known her. But my dad says she didn’t used to be. He says it started when they got me. 



My parents were high school sweethearts. They got married when they were 22. My mom couldn’t wait to have a baby. 



But a baby didn’t come. 



She and my dad tried for years. My mom doesn’t like to talk about that time. She says she barely remembers it. I think she was probably drunk or asleep for most of it.



But then, seven years after they’d started trying, they got a call. From the fire department. Did they still want a baby? Because a baby girl (me!) had been found just outside of town. Abandoned. My dad says I was a miracle. I like to imagine the night they brought me home. The three of us together and safe and happy. 



I think we could have stayed happy, if my dad never drew Young Gun. 



He and Gunner faced off at the finals in Vegas. My mom and I were in the stands. The announcer called my dad’s name, and then Young Gun’s. The crowd went wild. My mom  wanted to close her eyes, but instead she just squeezed me tight. 



Straight out of the chute, Gunner bucked forward violently. My dad held on, angled himself high over Gunner’s shoulders. He’d done this a thousand times before. It’s what any good rider would’ve done. But just as he leaned forward, Gunner thrust his massive head up hard. 



It broke every major bone in my dad’s face on impact.



He was stunned. Just laid there flat on the dirt ground. Mom covered my eyes. That’s the part I remember most. Knowing something bad was happening but not being able to see. 



My dad strained to connect his brain to his muscles. He looked for me and mom in the crowd. But he found another face instead: JB Young’s. Young Gun was JB’s bull – the magnificent result of decades of selective breeding, destined to land my dad flat on his back and unable to do a simple thing like wiggle his fingers. He was pretty sure he was dying at that point. Then, just before his vision went black, he swears he saw JB Young smile. 



He didn’t die, but he did spend the next few years in and out of the hospital, various surgeons trying to make his face less monstrous. My mom was by his side through all of it, but my dad was distant. They divorced a few years later. 



My dad hated JB Young. 



Maybe this is a good time to mention that JB Young isn’t his real name. I’ve changed all the names here. The only reason I feel semi-safe sharing my story now is because JB died recently. But not fully safe – not safe enough to use his real name.



The man I’m calling JB Young was rich. Not comfortable or well-off or wealthy. *Rich.* His grandfather discovered or maybe stole some oil fields, so JB’s empire was already worth millions when he inherited it. Then, he announced his plans to add several gigawatts of electricity to the Texas grid with wind energy. The wind turbines in my dreams belonged to him. JB turned from oil tycoon to green energy advocate, he got even richer, and he stayed the king of North Texas.



On the day I want to tell you about, JB was 76 and semi-retired. And I’d been visiting with him once a week for about a year. Obviously, my dad would’ve hated this. Which is why I didn’t tell him, and why I couldn’t ask him for a ride to JB’s. I didn’t like lying to him. But I had to. 



So every Tuesday afternoon, I walked nearly three miles to JB’s compound, Ivory Hills Ranch (named after his late wife and no real hills to speak of). 



And on this day, I should have known something was off right from the start. 



As I took a left onto JB’s road, I heard a rustle behind me. I froze. But then, pulled by curiosity or maybe something else, I stepped toward the noise. A black cloud swirled over the tall yellow grass. As I got closer, the cloud started to buzz. It was a swarm of flies feasting on a dead cow. I gagged. The stench was so thick I could hardly breathe. The cow’s flesh was rotted down to the ribs. Its eyes weren’t eyes anymore – just holes full of squirming insects. For a long moment, I couldn’t look away. And then finally, I turned back to the road. Looking back now, it’s hard not to see the cow as a bad omen.



But this had been happening for years – livestock dying across the Panhandle. Probably a family of coyotes, the dairy farmers thought at first. Dr. Gomez, the town veterinarian, wasn’t sure. The deep gouges in the cows’ dry bones didn’t exactly match up with coyote teeth. 



But it wasn’t just the cows anymore. Two bodies had turned up last month. Gnawed to the bone. 



Burton Beardon blamed her ghost lady. 



The smell of rancid flesh was still in my nose when I arrived at JB’s gray stone mansion. As I waited for JB or more likely one of his many housekeepers to come to the door, I looked behind me. After JB’s death, Ivory Hills was broken up and sold off in chunks, but at the time, it was over 50,000 acres. Right beyond the manicured front yard was a bronze sculpture garden, and right beyond that was a corral of meaty bulls. One of JB’s rich guy hobbies was rearing rodeo bulls, like Young Gun. Mostly Brahman crosses, bred to be huge and angry. One of the bulls turned to face me. The others were gray-blue or spotted, but this one was fully white, like he was dipped in cream. I shivered. The white bull must’ve been knocking at 2000 pounds and could’ve killed a grown man in seconds. But it wasn’t that. 



It was the way he was looking right at me. And the way he looked exactly like old photos I’d seen of Young Gun. The bull that smashed my father’s face into a thousand pieces.



The front door swung open. It was JB himself, smiling wide and earnest, showing off his subtly done veneers. “Riley, honey. Good afternoon.” (Just so you know, that’s not my real name either.)



“Good afternoon, Mr. Young.” JB didn’t really look filthy rich. Just Texan. He always wore a tucked-in flannel and cowboy hat, although he took the hat off at home. He had manners. I stepped into the foyer. The fir-vaulted ceilings were almost 30 feet tall. 



By this point, you’re probably wondering how I ended up being sort of, well… *friends* with one of the richest men in Texas who also happened to be my dad’s sworn enemy. I first met JB when I was writing an article for my school paper the year before. JB had announced yet another wind farm expansion. I was determined to land an interview with JB himself, and I guess my persistent emails started to annoy him, or he was getting bored in retirement, or probably both. Whatever the reason, he answered and agreed to meet for an interview. 



I questioned JB on the ways he’d pushed people off their land to expand the wind farms. I was nervous. People in the Panhandle didn’t question JB much, at least not to his face. But he gave me a straightforward answer about making tough decisions and compensating people fairly. I didn’t know if I agreed with him, exactly, but his eloquence impressed me. When the interview ended, and I went to shake JB’s hand, he stared at my outstretched palm for a long moment. Then he shook it firmly with a warm smile. JB was taking me seriously. I had really planned to hate him. But then, to my surprise, I didn’t.



So when JB called to offer me an internship, I didn’t hesitate to accept it. This would look even better than newspaper on my college apps! I told my newspaper teacher the news, feeling pretty impressed with myself.



“You know, and I don’t want to get your hopes up because it’s rare…” said my teacher. “But sometimes, when JB Young takes a real liking to a student, he’ll pay for their college. Room and board, tuition, books – soup to nuts.”



I was practically frothing at the mouth. My job at Burton Beardon’s paid minimum wage – my savings would barely make a dent in college expenses. I knew my parents wanted to help, but the fact of the matter is that my parents were and are poor. 



But back to that day. JB settled into his recliner, and I sat on the plush sofa. My “internship” mostly consisted of reading novels to him. Today I was reading *Rebecca*, one of his wife’s favorites. 



Once in a while, I did wonder why an old man – a sort of famous, super rich one, no less – had taken such a special interest in me. I mean, I wasn’t stupid. I knew to be wary of things like that. But I was pretty sure JB was just lonely. And he wasn’t interested in me like *that*. 



Nearly 30 years after his wife Ivory’s sudden death, he was still deeply in love with her. Infatuated, even. Sometimes I’d catch JB staring at the wedding photo on his mantle while I read. In the photo, young JB smiled with unaltered teeth and hope, and his Ivory was beautiful and happy and alive. Her thick dark hair and high cheekbones reminded me of my own, but I brushed that off. I thought it was all very romantic, honestly. My own parents’ love for each other broke under pressure. But not even death broke JB’s love for Ivory. Also, not that I ever would have said this outloud… I’m sort of embarrassed even writing it here now. But JB’s attention was the first thing to validate something shameful that burned deep inside me: the feeling that I was different. The hope that I was special.



I cracked open *Rebecca.* But JB was in one of his chatty moods. “I mentioned next week, right? That I won’t be here?”



He’d mentioned it a few times, actually. Enough to make me wonder if he was starting to get a little senile. JB was heading to Houston for the rodeo. A couple of his bulls would be competing, and the draw would pair them with their riders.



“You did. Who are you hoping for?” I asked.



“I like the looks of Bill Macy. I reckon he’s got the best chance of holding on. But it don’t much matter, in the end. We just need the judges to see what Junior can do.” Bucking bulls are considered athletes just as much as the rodeo stars who ride them. They’re scored separately from their riders, racking up points for their leaps and spins and general unruliness. JB’s bulls, of course, were champions. 



“Junior. That’s the white one?” 



“Yup. He’s a beauty, huh? You seen him when you pass by the corral?” 



I nodded.



“You see how big he is?” JB asked proudly. “But he moves like a skinny little chicken about to get its head chopped off. I ain’t seen a bull that big and that fast since his daddy. Yup, Junior’s gonna be a star. Just like his daddy.” 



*His daddy.* Suddenly, I thought I knew who Junior’s daddy was.



JB and I had never talked about the awkward fact that it was his bull that nearly killed my dad. But it looked like he was waiting for an answer, even though he didn’t exactly ask a question. So I gave him one. “I guess Junior’s daddy must… Must be Young Gun.” 



“That’s right,” said JB. “But – and you might find this interesting, what with your AP Biology class this semester – Junior wasn’t sired in a typical way. He’s not Gunner’s baby. He’s his copy.”



“Like…” I started, sure that JB couldn’t mean this literally. “Like, his spitting image?”



JB laughed. “Something like that. Junior’s actually a clone. A genetic duplicate of Young Gun.”



“Um. Oh. Well… *Why?*” I had a lot of questions, but that’s the first one that came out. I knew a tiny bit about clones. As in I’d watched *Star Wars: Episode II* and seen photos of Dolly the sheep. But I didn’t think clones were something you could just, like… make. Not in the Panhandle, anyway.



“Why? Well, that’s an interesting question, Riley. And it comes down to this: I wanted to, and I could. Young Gun was a special bull, some say the best bucking bull in history. I wanted another Gunner. So I hired a few scientists from A&M, built a lab, and made another Gunner.”



I looked all this up later. If you’re curious, This American Life actually did [an episode](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/291/reunited-and-it-feels-so-good/act-two-6) about the cloning of rodeo bulls. Maybe it’s what inspired JB, but I can’t exactly picture him listening to public radio.



And in his sitting room that day, I wasn’t thinking about science or Ira Glass. I was thinking about how my dad would feel about Young Gun’s literal clone heading down to Houston. Bad. Very bad. Frankly, I didn’t like it either. But I had to tread carefully. *My internship. My dreams. The money.* “But… And Mr. Young, I don’t want you to think I’m being ungrateful or anything–”  
  


“You can ask questions, Riley. I don’t think you’re ungrateful.”



“I guess I’m just wondering… You had to retire Gunner, right? Because they said he’d end up killing somebody sooner or later, after he hurt my dad and then that other rider… Won’t Junior be dangerous, too?”



“Another interesting question. But the association knows what Junior is. The riders know, too. They’re *excited*. It’s a dangerous sport. There’s always risk. But Junior hasn’t hurt nobody. Not yet, anyway.” He laughed lightly, as if this was funny. It wasn’t funny to me. I felt an uncomfortable pit in my stomach. I wasn’t quite ready to identify it yet, but it was the fear that maybe my dad was right about JB.



“But Riley,” JB continued with a weird intensity, “Asking these questions is a good thing. It shows an intellectual curiosity. I have that curiosity, too. It’s why when the first few clones turned out… Well, not quite *right…* I kept trying. Listen to me close, now, honey. You can’t let anything or anybody get in the way of what you want.” 



My stomach pit grew, watered by the passionate spittle that sprayed from JB’s mouth. The wind chimes clinked out on the porch. I turned to the window. It was starting to rain a little bit. 



“Your mama drop you off today?” JB asked.



“No, I walked. Maybe I should head out now, before it gets worse.”



“Don’t be silly, now. You’re not walking home in this. Might even be a twister brewing out there. I’ll have Tommy drive you when he gets back from putting the horses up.”



“Are you sure? Alright, thank you, if you’re sure.”



The lights flickered. Off, then on, then off again.



“Op! There they go,” JB yelped, almost delighted. Thick clouds had gathered outside, so it was dark with the lights off. The whites of JB’s eyes glowed. He chuckled, and his porcelain teeth glowed, too. Then, with a dull click and hum, the lights were back. 



But I felt… off. Maybe the air pressure was dropping. Maybe JB was right about a tornado brewing. “I’ll be right back. I have to use the restroom,” I said, even though I didn’t really. 



JB nodded and reclined his chair. He closed his eyes. It made him look old and helpless again.



The bathroom had monogrammed towels and Texas Rose soap that I can still smell if I try. I washed my hands slowly, not wanting to go back out there. In the mirror, I saw the space between the floor and the door darken, like somebody was standing just outside. But then the shadow was gone. I shut off the tap.



JB was still reclined in his chair when I got back to the sitting room. He placed a tumbler of whiskey on the side table when I sat back down. Had the whiskey been next to him this whole time, and I just hadn’t noticed? I opened my book again.



“I want to apologize, honey. I’m sure you can tell I’m a little extra sentimental today. It’s our anniversary. Woulda been 40 years.”  This comforted me in a weird way. It explained the nostalgia, the intensity, the whiskey. JB was just sad. 



“Don’t apologize. I’m sure it’s been a really hard day.” I tried to give a smile that was comforting and kind, but not too full of pity. 



“You must be sick of me going on about her.” 



“I’m not. I think it’s… nice,” I said. It wasn’t even a lie, really. I shut *Rebecca,* finally giving up.



“It just wouldn’t feel right. Loving her like that and then looking for someone new.” He leaned forward in his chair. “Do you think that’s pathetic? That I can’t move on?” 



I swallowed. “No. It’s not fair. That you found someone you loved so much and then you lost her.” 



“Thank you for saying that, Riley.” He leaned back, but kept looking right at me. I didn’t like it. “Your parents got pretty lucky, didn’t they? Getting to adopt you. Getting to keep somebody they loved.” 



I shifted. *What?* “Yeah, I guess so.” 



“Where is it they found you, again? Where’d you come from, honey?” 



The lights flickered again. I scooted back on the couch. “Um, off Highway 60. Near Sweetwater Creek.”



Outside, the rain came down harder. “Near Sweetwater Creek, huh! You know that’s my land?” I nodded, I did know that. JB pushed off his headrest, eyes shining. 



“You know, in a way, that makes you my baby, don’t it?”



*What the fuck?* I had no idea how to respond to that. But I didn’t have to. Because a piercing wail broke the silence. 



It was a tornado siren. There was a tornado coming. 



The lights went out again. I didn’t want to weather a tornado with JB. I wanted to go home.  But he was already out of his chair. He said we had to get to his shelter, *now.*  



He opened the front door and I followed him into the storm. The siren was louder out there, painful. The rain was coming down so hard I could barely see anything, just the blinking red lights of the wind turbines flashing in the dark. 



JB yanked my hand. Pulled me over to a concrete block jutting out of the ground – the entrance to an underground tornado shelter. He crouched down to the door and fiddled with the heavy chain lock. He dropped the keys, and then I felt kind of bad for him again. Just a sad old man at the end of the day. So I bent over and picked them up for him. And then he finally got the fucking thing open. He told me to go first. 



I looked into the opening. Steep steps led into pitch black. I hesitated. Asked where Tommy and his housekeepers were. “Shouldn’t they come with us?” 



But JB said he had other shelters on the other side of the house. “They’re safe, don’t worry. Hurry up now. It’s getting worse.”



I started down the steps. I couldn’t see anything at first. I reached out a hand to touch the wall. I heard JB close the door behind him with a loud thud. It somehow got even darker.



I stumbled at the bottom of the stairs. It was cold. Damp. My eyes started to adjust and I could make out some shadows. I looked to my side and froze. Eyes stared back at me. 



But then JB turned the lights on and I realized I was next to a big pane of glass. It was just my reflection. 



The shelter was basically one very long hallway. Steel, concrete, sterile. The big glass panel lined one side of the hall. There was a room beyond the glass, but I couldn’t tell how deep it went. The light didn’t reach back there. 



A scuttling noise broke through the muffled tornado siren. It sounded like a rat, maybe? But bigger. “Are there animals down here?” I asked JB. 



He cocked his head, like he didn’t know how to answer. Or maybe like he just didn’t want to. He smiled a little bit, but his eyes were looking past me. At the glass panel. That’s when I noticed he brought his rifle. He saw me eye it.



“You can never be too careful,” he said. He left the rifle leaning by the wall and stepped toward me. “You know, something you said earlier really struck me. About my Ivory being taken from me. You said ‘it’s not fair.’ And Riley, I have to agree with you there. It just ain’t fair.”



I took a step back. I said again how sorry I was that this happened to him, to his wife. 



“Me too. I was sorry. I was real sorry. But – and you’re old enough to know this now – sorry just don’t cut it, does it? Sorry wasn’t doing nothing for me, and it sure as hell wasn’t doing nothing for Ivory.” He grinned like a maniac. I was starting to feel sick. 



I tried to take another step back, but I was up against the glass. He closed the gap between us, got down in my face. I could smell him, a nasty mix of whiskey and aftershave and old food caught in his dentures. “So being a man who believes in doing, I just had to do something.” His eyes flicked back to the glass behind me. “Look honey, they wanna meet ya.” 



I froze. Then I forced myself to follow JB’s eyes, to look through the glass. Two eyeballs stared back. And this time, I knew they weren’t mine. 



She was tall and pale with tangled dark hair. She wore a white nightgown, bloody and torn. She looked almost exactly like the bride smiling next to JB in the photo on his mantle. *Almost* exactly like Ivory. Except for her pink-red eyes. She took a jerky step toward her side of the glass. And then her jaw dropped down, unhinged, revealing the dark tunnel of her mouth and the jagged teeth within. A low buzz gargled out. It got louder and higher until it was a scream.

 

I screamed back. And it’s only when I stumbled away from the glass that I saw the rest of them. There were six of them, maybe, but it’s hard to say for sure. Because I still couldn’t see to the back of the room beyond the glass. They all had the same pale skin, the same dark hair, the same red eyes. But some of them looked older or younger, some were taller, a few were on all fours, scrambling toward the glass like animals. One of them looked about six years old. They were all screaming, and their screams were all the same. It was one big terrible, gravely, metallic sound. 



I jumped. JB’s hand was on my shoulder.  “How could I let her go?” He shouted, straining to be heard over their scream. “It hasn’t been easy. But she’s worth it. You have to keep trying until you get the result you want.” 



I wriggled out of his grasp, horrified. Young Gun was just the start. One by one, the Ivories closed their mouths and stopped screaming. It was so quiet. It sounded like the storm outside had died down some.  



I stared at them. They looked cold, dirty, hungry. I was scared. But I was sad, too. 



The first Ivory put her right hand on the glass. Her nails were thick and yellowed. JB lifted a finger to the glass, traced the V-shaped birthmark on her scabbed palm. 



“You just keep them… down here?” I asked. 



“It’s safer that way,” he said, like it was completely logical. “But sometimes they get out. You’ve probably seen one once or twice, or at least seen something they’ve done. They’re curious creatures, like you. And they’re insatiable. I’ve never seen anything like it, all the animals I’ve raised. First time they tasted blood changed everything. It started with the cows. But then they found people. It’s gotten bad, lately.” The Ivory jerked her hand down. She swiveled her head. Looked right at me as JB continued. “It’s gotten real bad.”



He seemed to get embarrassed all of a sudden. “You probably think I’m terrible, keeping ‘em locked up. But it’s for their own good. They’re not quite right, you can see that plain as day. Years ago, I even thought they ate one of their own – a new one – when she was just a baby. I know they’re dangerous, I know they want blood, I just can’t… I have to protect ‘em, Riley.” And then he started crying. “I love them. I love every single one of them.” 



I tried to sound really casual, like it was just any old day. “Mr. Young, I think the storm has passed. I think I’d better get home.” 



He smiled at me. “Oh honey, you know I can’t let you go home.” 



My mouth went dry. “What?” I looked for JB’s rifle, it was still leaning against the wall. He saw me looking. 



“Don’t worry, Riley. I would never hurt you. But you can’t go home.” He wasn’t crying anymore. 



The Ivories were gathered right up against the glass. One was somehow halfway up it, gripping on like a lizard. They let out a low, rumbling growl. It gave me some sort of weird confidence. 



“I’m leaving now.” I tried to shove past JB, but he grabbed me. 



“No, you’re not.” JB’s old hand dug into my upper arm. He was still strong, and it hurt. The Ivories snapped upright, palms pressed against the glass. They screamed. 



“Stop it now.” JB screamed back at them, and his grip on my arm tightened. The Ivories banged their heads against the glass with a horrible crunch. They pounded their fists. And they kept screaming. “Stop it now!” JB pleaded. But they didn’t stop. JB started crying again. 



The glass spidered. He dropped my arm and pushed me behind him. 



“What are you doing!” He yelled at them, red-faced. “I love you! I’m protecting you! Don’t you know how much I love you!” He sobbed. “Don’t you know that I love you?”



He looked right at me. “I did this for you.”



The glass shattered. The Ivories scrambled over the broken glass and descended on JB. He was still staring at me. “You’re gonna have to shoot ‘em.”



I was up against the wall, the rifle next to me. I grabbed it. I had shot one a few times. 



The Ivories clawed at JB’s hair, pulled at his limbs. One bit into his stomach. “Shoot! Shoot them, honey. They’re gonna kill me.” 



I aimed the rifle. The Ivories still had JB pinned under their bony limbs, but they froze. They looked at me with their sad red eyes. The Ivories took a deep breath, all at once. I took one too, with them. And in that moment I knew they wouldn’t hurt me. They had saved me, years ago, and now they were saving me again.



I shot JB in the thigh. He howled in pain. 



“I’m sorry,” I whispered.  I dropped the gun and ran up the stairs. 



JB called after me. “Wait. I knew the moment I met you, my perfect girl.” I  looked back at him. Just once. He looked pathetic. The Ivories swarmed him like flies on a cow. I turned around and kept running. 



“No! Don’t leave me again, Ivory!” he wailed. And then he was drowned out by the distance, and by the shrieks of his clones, and then finally, by the shelter door that slammed closed behind me. I thought about locking it, but I just kept running. 



JB survived the attack. I never saw him again, but I heard he was different. Didn’t talk anymore, couldn’t get around too well. 



I still haven’t told my parents this story. I’ve even mostly convinced myself it didn’t happen. But when I catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror in the dark, it’s hard to deny it. When I look down at the V-shaped birthmark on my palm, it’s impossible.
