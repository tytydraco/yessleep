Sorry if this isn't the right place to post, but I'm getting pretty freaked out and I need advice.

Some background-- Yesterday ago was my move-in day for college. I'm a freshman at a college that I don't want to name here, but it's an all-girls school on the smaller side. I've never lived away from home before, so I was definitely nervous moving in, but things went all right. I met my roommate, a really nice girl named Mei, and we hit it off pretty quickly. Day 1 was mostly orientation and preparing for course registration, relatively normal stuff which I won't bore you with here.

Where things got weird was the first night sleeping in my new dorm. If I'm being completely honest, I was a mess. Like I said, I've never lived away from home before, much less all the way across the country. As much as I liked (and still do like!) Mei, I didn't know anybody else here. I missed my parents and the homesickness was really getting to me. So, I was already awake and silently crying when they first knocked on my door.

Seeing as it was nearly 2 AM and Mei was already asleep, I figured if I didn't get out of bed, whoever it was would eventually leave. But they kept knocking, and I saw Mei stirring in her bed. Out of annoyance more than anything, I opened the door and saw three RAs standing outside my door.

"Quick, get dressed and come to the common room! We've got a (college name) tradition to do!"

I wasn't super interested, but Mei was already putting on her clothes and urged me to do the same. When we came down to the common room, we were the only ones there, save for the three RAs from before. They said we were the first ones down, and to come with them outside for an "orientation." Mei and I followed them out of the building, down the dirt path, and to the lake that sat on the edge of campus grounds. I instantly didn't like where this was going. 

Suddenly, the three RAs jumped into the lake, and beckoned for us to follow. Mei did, and immediately started laughing and splashing the other girls. This part is a little embarrassing for me, but I honestly just kind of stood there. I realized that my eyes were still red and puffy, and that the absolute last thing that would make be feel better was to jump in that cold and kind of gross lake. I didn't want anyone to see how distressed I was, so I just mumbled something about "being tired" and ran back up to my dorm, not caring how uncool I looked.

This morning, when I woke up, Mei wasn't in her bed. At first I assumed she was at breakfast, but I didn't see her there either. She had given me her number the day prior, so I texted her, but it didn't go through. Part of me chalked it up to some issue with either her having a Chinese phone or, like, the number being from China or something, but I did feel a little weirded out. It wasn't until lunch that I started getting actually worried for her.

This was because an RA (I think her name was Jordan?) came up to me, and asked if I had seen her. This wasn't one of the RAs from last night, but I recognized her from one of yesterday's events. I said not since last night, and asked why. Jordan said that Mei had missed one of the mandatory information events, and needed to come to a makeup session tomorrow so I should let her know if I see her. I've known Mei for less than 48 hours, but that sounded strangely out of character for her. I had floated around the idea yesterday of skipping some of the information sessions, and she had shaken her head, saying she was determined to go to all of them (even the optional ones). Immediately, I thought to last night's lake dip, and my head went through every possibility from alien abduction to a shark attack. Even though aliens aren't real and I highly highly doubted any sharks lived in the quaint little college lake, I was scared that something bad had happened to her last night. I told Jordan that the last time I saw her was during the "lake initiation," and I didn't know if she even came back. 

"Lake initiation? I've never heard of that."

"Uhh... yeah, some RAs came up to our dorm room and told us to jump in the lake..."

"Which ones?"

"Well... I don't know their names, I just recognized the RA shirts they wore."

Jordan pulled up a picture of all of our dorm's RAs, and asked me to point out which ones came to our room. As I scanned the photo, none of the faces looked like the ones from last night. Once I told her that, she sighed, and remarked how it was probably an "RA from one of the other dorms playing a prank." She said she'd go talk to the nearby dorms, but I think both of us thought that was a weird explanation.

Throughout the rest of the day, I kept feeling a pit in my stomach. Now that I thought about it, were the people who came to our dorm room last night really even RAs? They didn't even introduce themselves as such, I just assumed so because of the shirts. If I had stayed with Mei, would she have been safer? Or would we both have disappeared? A part of me felt glad that I avoided whatever happened to her, and another part of me felt horrible for even thinking that.

Unfortunately, that isn't the end of this story. It's the middle of the night now, and I was woken up about half an hour ago by someone knocking on my door again. I didn't open it. Something in my gut told me not to. After about five minutes the knocking stopped. Mei is still missing, I still haven't seen the three RAs from before, and I have no idea what to do. I'm posting this to ask for help. I'm terrified that I let my friend disappear, and even more scared of whatever's knocking.

I will be updating this as more goes on.
