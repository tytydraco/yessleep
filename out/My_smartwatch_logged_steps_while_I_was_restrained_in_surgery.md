I had my appendix removed three days ago. Emergency surgery, in and out same day. Everything went fine. Recovery is normal. But when I checked my fitness app this morning, something was wrong.

My smartwatch logged 2,847 steps during my surgery.

I was under general anesthesia. Strapped to the operating table. Unconscious for two hours and fourteen minutes according to my medical records. My arms were restrained at my sides the entire time. The nurses confirmed this when I called to ask.

So why does my watch say I walked almost three miles between 2:17 PM and 4:31 PM on Tuesday?

I thought it was a glitch. I googled it. Apparently smartwatches can log phantom steps from vibrations or arm movements. Elevators can trigger it. So can washing machines. Made sense. I was about to dismiss it when I noticed something else.

My heart rate data.

During surgery, my heart rate was monitored by the hospital equipment. Steady. Normal. The anesthesiologist's notes confirm this. I requested my records this morning and went through every page. Nothing unusual. But my smartwatch recorded something different.

At 2:43 PM, my heart rate spiked to 189 BPM. It stayed elevated for six minutes, then dropped back to normal. At 3:12 PM, it happened again. 201 BPM for four minutes. Then again at 3:58 PM. 176 BPM for eight minutes.

The hospital monitors showed nothing during these times. Steady 72 BPM throughout the entire procedure.

I was playing candy crush on my phone last night trying to distract myself when I decided to check the GPS data. That's when everything got worse.

My watch tracks location. During surgery, it should have shown me stationary at the hospital. Instead, there's a gap. From 2:17 PM to 4:31 PM, no location data was recorded. Like my watch couldn't figure out where I was. Or like I wasn't anywhere the GPS satellites could see.

I called the hospital again. Asked if there were any complications during surgery. Anything unusual. Power outages. Equipment failures. Anything.

They said no. Everything was routine. I was monitored the entire time. Never woke up. Never moved. The OR staff confirmed I was unconscious and restrained from the moment anesthesia took effect until I was wheeled into recovery.

But my watch says I was walking. My watch says my heart was racing. My watch says I was nowhere.

Last night I had a dream. I was walking down a white hallway. Fluorescent lights overhead. The floor was cold linoleum. I wasn't wearing shoes. I could feel every step. The texture of the floor. The slight stick of something dried on the tiles.

I walked and walked but the hallway never ended. There were doors on both sides but they were all locked. I tried every single one. Some had windows but they were frosted. I could see shadows moving behind them but couldn't make out what they were.

At the end of the hallway there was a door that looked different. Heavier. Metal. It had a small window at eye level. When I looked through it, I saw myself on the operating table. The doctors were working. My chest was rising and falling with the ventilator.

But I was standing in the hallway watching.

Then I woke up. My feet were dirty. There was white tile dust on my sheets. Under my fingernails.

I live on the second floor. All my floors are hardwood.

I'm looking at my smartwatch now. It's logging steps. I'm sitting perfectly still in my chair typing this, but the step count is going up. 10,479. 10,480. 10,481. 10,482.

I haven't moved in twenty minutes.

The watch is still on my wrist. I can feel it. But when I look down, I can see through it slightly. Like it's not entirely here anymore. Like I'm not entirely here.

I'm going to take it off. But I'm scared of what happens when I do. What if the steps are the only thing keeping me tethered? What if when I stop walking, I go back to that hallway?

The one I was in while they cut me open.

The one I'm apparently still walking through.
