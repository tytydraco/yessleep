I thought my aunt had helped me with the security deposit, but the little house I rented didn't have a landlord. She was a liar. The little envelopes of cash I mailed every month went to her. To one of her other little houses.

"I was helping you save. For after."

This was a special courtesy, I suppose reserved for family.

The first September, I liked my little house. It was old, and the chipped gray paint reminded me of wool. All the brass fixtures had worn from where hands have touched over the years.  
The water dispensed from a well and the mineral smell was pleasant. Couldn't drink it though. I bought all my water in gallon jugs from the convenience store. It was the closest shop for a couple of miles.

When the wind picked up in October, the sound was shallow enough to mistake for the leaves. The house was bordered on all sides by woods and sat behind the road against 80 acres of privately owned preserve.

By Halloween, the sound had picked up and I thought it might've been trick-or-treaters. That night, I kept checking through the blinds over and over. I thought I was going mad because there wasn't a single kid in sight. No chaperones, no bands of teenagers.

By 11 PM, it was only getting louder.

Anxiety got the best of me and I grabbed my keys, threw open the door, ran down the steps, and jumped in my truck. There had to be someone, even though there were no streetlights on that road. About a mile down the road, when I cracked the windows for air, it was clear for the first time.

Like applause in a ballroom, from everywhere.  
Men and women's voices in commending tones, glasses tapping against plate rims.

By the last mile I'd worked myself into partial visibility. My eyes have always watered when nervous. I still hate this about myself. It's like cowardice leaking from my head.  
I nearly parked sideways in the convenience store lot.

"Yeah?"

Jesse, the clerk, said. I must've been standing for a moment too long inside the door.

"You don't hear that?"

I asked her before realizing the sound had stopped.

November 1st, I called my aunt again. She didn't pick up after I'd gotten home the night before. My claims were brushed off as "holiday spirit after too many spirits," after I'd admitted to having a few drinks. We didn't speak again until Thanksgiving. I'd thought with her whimsical nature she'd be more receptive to my story. This frustrated me. I didn't know it yet but I was frustrated for the wrong reasons.

Throughout the month I was beyond shaken. I began to hear it during the daytime. It was inconsistent but more frequent. The first morning that it came, I didn't believe something so dreamlike could happen in the light.

I awoke to cheers outside my window and echoing clacks of string instruments settling against floorboards. I bolted upright and slapped my curtain aside. Nothing was there except for the stretch of grass before the tree line.

By the 16th I called out of work. It was too much to hear it while making coffee and then pretend things were normal. I called out on the 17th too. This was unlike me but my supervisor didn't make things difficult.

During those days I mostly waited. Then moved, then waited. I sat on the couch with the window cracked. Once I heard the applause I stood and put my ear to the sill. It stopped.  
I laid on my bed until it sounded again but once I stepped into the living room, it stopped. When it was quiet for a while, around noon, I went outside and sat on the side-porch steps.

I sat for an hour. The bare branches of the hickory trees clacked together close to the sky, in a wind so gentle. Feeling very settled I concentrated on my pulse, rhythmic and steady.  
The gravel soft and loose under my shoes. It was a rare moment of stillness for me. Contentment.

A sudden gust came and the sound erupted from beyond the trees. So much laughter, from the gut and bottom of the lungs. A crowd erupting in response to what must've been the most outrageous thing ever said. A hundred chairs creaked as if bodies were shifting back and forth, glasses shook as hands slammed down on clothed wooden tables.

I jolted forwards and fell to the dirt from the porch step. The laughter crescendoed. I nearly snapped my neck looking in all directions. At this point, it was the most frightened I'd ever been. Eyes wide, hot and watery. The tears escaped down my cheeks as I scrambled backwards towards my door.
