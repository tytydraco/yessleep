This is a completely true story that not many of my friends wants to believe, also excuse my english.

So one summer morning of 2016, me (at that time 13) and my younger brother (at that time 9) were sitting in our living room alongside my sister (at that time 18) with her friend the same age.

At that time we still didn't have our own home wifi for whatever reason, and we also had one of those old huge TV's with a big back (not a smart tv)

For the past few years me and my younger brother were obsessed with creepy pastas and horror movies. One particular horror movie that stuck with us was The Ring, with the iconic Samara Morgan, it was everything we could think about besides Bloody Mary, Charlie Charlie and Slenderman.

So me and my brother were just sitting in one corner of our living room stealing wifi from our neighbour, while my sister and her friend were doing each others hair. I forgot to mention that we still to this day live there and it's an apartment building in Eastern Europe.

Suddenly our TV stopped working, and the static screen turned on, which was very casual for that type of the TV. Me and my brother just looked at each other and laughed, we were like "Oh shit is Samara bout to pop off haha..." She did...or did she...?

The screen turned on and it was a picture of a forest with a well, and we could see the exact same [scene from the movie](https://i.makeagif.com/media/9-09-2021/dKI_GG.mp4) and it really started to creep us out. Samara Morgan was coming out of the well and coming toward our screen.

As she was getting closer to our TV screen, we started panicking and screaming so out of fear i pushed my brother to turn the TV off lol. So he started searching for the remote in light speed and when he found it he quickly turned the TV off just before her head was supposed to come out.

All of a sudden my sister asked "Why did you turn the music off?"

Me and my brother started to explain to them what happened and they said they didn't see anything and that the music was playing all this time. So the TV never turned off, it never booted The Ring scene and it most definitely didn't have Samara Morgan about to come out and kill us all.

Well that makes sense, but were the only people that encountered that be me and my brother...? How were we only ones that saw that, and it lasted well over a minute.

Apparently both him and i were laying down on our sofa looking at the ceiling and all of a sudden we jumped to turn the TV off.

Whenever we tell that story nobody believes us, it's just him and i that know what happened.

Was it a lucid dream or something? I am looking forward to the comments, i also have a bunch of other creepy storytimes from my childhood and i will post them all if this post manages to go up.

  
EDIT 1: Also it couldn't be them pulling pranks on us as we had no idea what are things such as Chromecast, youtube on TV and other stuff.
