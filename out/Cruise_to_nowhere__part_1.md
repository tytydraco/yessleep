Have you ever had that feeling that something is just to good to be true? Well someone once told me that when something is too good to be true, then it usually is to good to be true.   
Well my mother always had this habit of entering every online contest she could find, whether it is a questionnaire or even a survey, the moment she sees  the words “contest” or “win” she couldn’t help herself. But she also has this “fire and forget system” where she will enter and completely forget about it. It usually ends up been a dud, but she does have luck in that way where she would win little prizes at times, I think the biggest prizes she has won so far would be a months worth of groceries, which is always welcome as we are a struggling family. My father died just after my younger brothers birth and he was a struggling musician, so he didn’t have any life policies or even a funeral plan in place, my mother worked as a waitress at the time, so everything just accumulated to more debt for her, she ended up working double shifts 7 days a week and the few hours she was at home she would drink until she passed out. As I was the eldest the responsibilities of taking care of our home and my younger brother fell upon me, luckily I have always been an A student at school and I just got a scholarship to go to varsity to study for a medical doctor.   
Another thing that always counted in my favour is that I always had great looks, so I always ended up getting photographic modelling work which helped us as the money was pretty decent and I could at-least afford to buy some basic necessities for our home and myself, and since half of my mothers money went into alcohol and cigarettes it made things really tight at home, but it could have been worse, considering that she was there when my father was mutilated and murdered for a packet of smokes. She saw everything, the robbers didn’t just rob him, they tortured him and by the time the police arrived he was unrecognisable.   
My brother is 16 now and he is very sporty, he excels at every sport he tries and he keeps winning prizes, which makes me proud of him, but it also made him a bit over confident and arrogant, I myself am a 19 year old girl and I will be starting my first semester at the best medical school in my country next year.   
Let me tell you about the town where I live, I live in a small town just about 30km from the nearest city, and as we can’t afford boarding school my brother and myself always had to get up early in the morning and make it to the main road and hope someone would give us a ride to school, the mornings were the easy part of the day, it is in the afternoons that we really struggled and we have learned to just walk up the mountain after school as we got a better chance of getting home, some days we would get lucky and someone would pick us up, but other days it would take us hours to walk home.   
That’s a bit about my life.   
Now let me tell you what happened to us, so I finished school last year, but because I didn’t want my brother to go down alone I would still go down to the city with him daily, and I used this year to try and make extra money doing part time work in the city while my brother was at school. So on the last day of school for the year I met him at our usual spot and we decided to start making our way up the mountain when this really expensive car stopped next to us, I don’t really know much about cars as I’m more into my modelling and medical stuff, but if you see a long black sedan with tinted windows and shiny mags pull up you know that you are either in trouble, or you got very lucky.   
So the car pulled up next to us and this tall blonde well dressed, well groomed middle age man got out and looked at us. Aren’t you Zoe and Jean Clarke?   
Zoe. “Depends who is asking and why.”  
Man. “Relax, I’m here to deliver a prize to your family, would you guys like a ride home?”  
Zoe. “Um, a prize?”   
Man. “Yes. “ smiling. “Your family won the family of the year contest.”  
Zoe. “Oh okay, what is the prize?”  
Man. “I’m sorry, but I can only disclose that to Mrs Clarke.”  
Zoe. “You mean Miss.”  
Man. “Oh I apologise, I didn’t realise she got divorced. “  
Zoe. “Widowed.”  
Man. “I apologise and I’m sorry for your loss, now would you please get in? I’m on a rather tight schedule.”  
My brother and I look at each other and he just shrugs and gets in the back, I take a seat at the front and fasten my seatbelt. Honestly I am pretty thankful for this ride as it is very hot today, not that it’s ever not warm in South Africa.   
So the man gets in and he offers us each a bottle of cold water which we gladly accept as we are both dying of thirst and then without another word he starts the car and off we went, you know when you walk the same road every day you actually stop noticing the scenery and you just focus on where you are walking, that is how my brother and I have become, we stopped even noticing anything any-more, but today it was like as if for the first time ever we could enjoy the scenery again and the beauty of nature, but as I got lost in though the car came to a standstill and the man turned off the ignition. I look up to see that we arrived at my mothers work place.   
Man. “You two wait here, I will go fetch your mother and then we can all go talk at your house.”  
We both sit in the car stunned, how did he even know where mom works? Oh well, with all these contest and surveys she’s always filling out you never know.   
We watch on as he walks over to the owner and speaks to the owner, we can see the owner arguing with him and shaking his ear, but then this strange man pulls something out of his pocket and hands it to the owner, the owner just goes pale and he becomes docile at once and goes inside, after a few minutes he comes out with our mother and we can see him handing her a thick envelope and shaking her hand, she just smiles and gives him a tight hug. Then her and the man comes over and they both get into the car.   
Zoe. “Hi mom.”  
Mom. “Hi kids.”  
Jean. In his usual arrogant tone. “Hi mom.”  
Zoe. “Mom, what just happened?”  
Mom. “Oh nothing, James just gave me a years worth of wages and said to have fun and he will see us when we get back.”  
Now I am very confused. “A years wages? See us when we get back.”  
Man. “Don’t worry about it, I will explain everything at your house.”  
Just then we pulled into the driveway and we all went inside.   
The man grabs a cooler box out of the drunk and he joins us on the veranda, he then first takes out a bottle of wine and then 4 glasses, but then he stops and looks in the direction of the gate and back at me. “Zoe, I think you might want to get that.”  
Just then I heard a voice calling my name at the gate. “Zoe!!! Zoe!!!! “   
I get up and grab the gate keys to let Chloe in, now Chloe is my best friend, but Chloe is not her real name, she picked the name Chloe because she said it rhymes with Zoe, she use to be a boy, but she is a transgender girl now, and honestly if she had to enter modelling I would quit, she actually got a scholarship to go and study psychiatry.   
So as Chloe and I get back inside the man is sitting on the one chair by the table with a huge grin on his face. He poured 5 glasses of dry red wine and everyone seems to be waiting in anticipation.   
Man, “well, now that we are all here I guess I can tell you what your big prize is.”  
Jean. “Let me guess, a years worth of groceries.” Still in his arrogant sarcastic tone.”  
Mom. “Stop it, don’t be rude.”  
Man. “No, well that as well. But you guys, the 4 of you won an epic cruise to everywhere and nowhere. “  
Chloe. “Wait, that doesn’t make any sense at all, everywhere and nowhere?”  
Now have you ever had that feeling that something is wrong? Terribly wrong? Like first of all it’s too good to be true, and yet nothing makes sense?” Well that’s the feeling I have right now, and looking back, I wish I went with my instincts.  
Man. “Yes, you will go everywhere and stay nowhere. Congratulations.”  
So we all take our wine glasses and cheers and take a sip. “ I’m still feeling uneasy about the whole thing. But I decided to keep quiet for my moms sake, she’s been working for years without even so much as 1 day break. And I could see that she was really excited for this.   
Mom. “So how long is this cruise for?”  
Man. “Oh just a couple of months or so. Don’t worry, you will have the time of your LIFE.” The way he said LIFE, with an almost creepy voice gave me the chills.  
But hey, it’s a cruise, the worst that can happen is the ship can sink, right?”  
Man. “And don’t worry about bringing anything, everything will be provided for you on the cruise, it’s an all inclusive cruise, even your clothing will be provided. We already got your sizes and everything, so your cabin will be fully stocked, and the best part is all food and drinks are included in your package. “ then he looks at my brother. “And since it’s in international waters, there is no age limit stopping you from enjoying yourself.”  
Mom. “I don’t think I want him to start drinking yet.”  
Claude looking at my mom, you can see he is furious now. “Sure mom, you already drink enough for us all.”  
Zoe. “Stop it now!”   
Mom. “It’s okay, he is right.” I can see she is almost in tears.   
Man. “Anyway, you guys can celebrate tonight, but be ready by 0:00 (midnight) that is when your driver will collect you. “   
Chloe. “Midnight?”  
Man. “Yes, your cruise leaves at 3:33am.”  
Zoe. “You do realise that we would never make it in time.”  
Man. “Relax, our driver has never missed.”  
Jean. “Frowning now. “Never missed.”  
Man. Looking at his wrist. “Oh my, look at the time, I got to be on my way.” And he gets up and walks out. I get up to follow him, but when I get to the gate both him and his car are gone. As I look around in confusion I feel a cold chill run down my back, nobody is this fast, I was just a few seconds behind him.  
I get back to find the group already in the second bottle of wine, it seems this strange man left is 6 bottles, so I join in, more out of nervousness, but soon the wine hits me and I fell asleep on the couch. But just as I start to fall into a deep sleep my mom shakes me awake.   
Mom. “Zoe, we got to get ready, the driver will be here shortly.”  
Zoe. “Mom, are you sure you want to go?”  
Mom, “Of-course we are going. It’s a free holiday.”  
Zoe. “But mom, doesn’t something feel off about this whole thing?”  
Mom, “of course, but I spoke to the neighbour and she said she will check on the house for us.”  
Zoe. “Not that, this holiday.”  
Mom. “Yeah, a fee all inclusive holiday? It’s about time we won a big prize like this.”  
Zoe. “But mom, can you remember…”  
Just then I get interrupted by a car hooting st the gate.   
Before I could say anything else an excited Chloe grabs my hand and yanks me to my feet, “let’s go sleepy head.”  
My mom locks up and we all get to the car waiting for us. It’s another black car similar to the first one, but this time it is a pale blonde woman driving it. She speaks to us in an almost hypnotic voice, “welcome, please get in, we have a long way to go.”  
Claude. “No shit. Not sure how we are going to make an 8 hour drive in 3:33.”  
Woman. “I am the best driver there is.”  
Claude. “Okay transporter. “  
My mom, Claude and Chloe shuffled into the back and I decide to hop in the front seat again.   
But soon after I got in a fell asleep again just to be awoken by this strange woman. “We have arrived.”  
I look around to the back to find the others also fell asleep, they are all yawning now and stretching.   
We shuffle out of the car to find an empty peer with a huge cruise ship waiting for us.   
Zoe. “This is strange, where is everyone else?”  
Woman. “Already on-board, we are a minute late. So off you go.”  
We make our way hesitantly into the ship to be greeted by an annoyed looking crew member, “you are a minute late.”  
Zoe. “Sorry, we were not the ones driving.”  
I then look around to find the door we entered through was already closed behind us.   
Crew. “Follow me please, I will show you to your cabins.”  
Chloe. “Cabins? That means we get more then one?”  
Crew. “You were each assigned your own individual cabin.”  
I could see this crew member wasn’t the talking type, so I stopped asking questions. We follow him down the hall, up the stairs into what seems to be the most beautiful love I’ve ever seen.   
The stairs seems to be made out of pure crystal and even the lights seem to be made out of crystal. He leads us over to a desk that says “Guest Services” where they immediately hand us each a blue card with our names and photographs on it.   
Mom. “How did you get our photographs?”  
Guest service associate. “We got them after you entered the contest.”  
Claude. “So you were spying on us?”  
Zoe. “Relax, they probably just did a social media survey on each of us.”  
Chloe. “I bet.” I can hear the disbelief in her voice.   
I look around the lobby and I see a whole bunch of people at different tables chattering away and enjoying different drinks, then I notice a table with 2 really beautiful woman sitting, they look to be about my age, but one has long blonde hair and blue eyes and she is wearing a long white dress, and the other one has long red hair and green eyes, and she seems to be wearing a similar dress to the other one, just hers is red. Then another table caught my eye, at it there is a slender beautiful lady sitting, she had long black hair, and is wearing a body hugging black evening dress, she has these sharp blue eyes, almost cat like, and talking about cats, she has a black cat laying in her shoulders just staring back at me, I couldn’t help but notice that she was sipping from a glass of red wine, then she looks back at me and lifts her glass and gives me a nod. “
