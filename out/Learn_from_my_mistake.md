You see there is this girl we meet like 4 years ago during a trip and I fell for her real hard so I took her number and when we got back home we talked for maybe 3 to 4 months (never met face to face after the trip) I told her that I like her and she liked me too (atleast that's what I thought)and me being me I just normally brought up the topic of marriage and asked her what is her opinion on marriage is I think I freaked her out or something she just blocked me (not her fault) and then she unblocked me after 3 or so months (that's what she said). I thought she hated me and did not want to make her uneasy I didn't contact her after that. And now after 3.5 years I messaged her and we started talking again and turns out she had a boyfriend for 2 years after we stopped talking(she did not waste any time of her life unlike me who stayed single all that time)Â  and he dumped her for another girl. That being that and my feelings not dying I just straight up told her that I still have feelings for her and told her that I can't see her as a friend. THIS IS THE IMPORTANT POINT SHE IS NOWHERE NEAR ME I AM IN AUSTRALIA AND SHE IS IN US. But me being the dumbass I am would work for it even if there is 0.000000001% that she would end up with me. So I told her I still have feelings for her and have her my number told her to only call me if she actually wants to talk to me even though she knows I am in way too deep.

And guess what she called the first time she called we talked for 5-6 hours and then for a month it continued as we talked about 2-3 hours a day. Then one day I told her that I love her (yeah I know I am delusional) and that I won't stop talking about how we are going to be together in the future and so much other stuff. And her reply was I only see you as a friend and my reply was I can't look at like a friend. That thing ended without a conclusion she doesn't want to leave and I won't leave. We started talking like normal again and I make comments about our relationship every chance I get.

Well now it's been almost a year now 18-1-25 and we just slowly drifted apart and I don't think there is anything I can do anymore. So I accepted that it's not gonna happen so I started to move on and installed hinge like a month ago everyday I swipe and send a message to at least 10 people a day (not for hookups).

Well how many replies do you guys think I got ? 

Absolute 0

So I said fuck the apps and went to interact with people outside like mixtures and stuff. So I don't if it's important or not but I have to mention this you see I live in Melbourne and most of the women here are asian when we go to a mixture and I am an Indian. Whenever I go to these mixtures I just feel out of place but I still soldiered on and tried to make conversation with some girls (the biggest mistake of my life), I approached them very gently but the look in their eyes was just to this day I don't know if it's disgust or fear. They looked like they were fearing for their life, so since that did not working I tried to join a group discussion and that didn't go well either, people just formed their own community groups and no one is speaking English. 

And before you say what my country girls, find me someone who is single and not looking like a pig (I know I am a horrible person but that's a fact physical appearance matter).

well after all this shit I think it's time I just accept the fact that I am just a unloveable monster. 

And let's be honest there is nothing desirable about me, not one bit. And I am pushing 25 and haven't dated once in my entire lifetime I haven't had my first of anything. 

I wasted my 19-23 waiting for a girl that was never even cared one bit.

I have an entire book dedicated for date ideas. It's like a bucket list that I wanted to do with my partner at least once before I die.

It seems that the book will have its pages empty forever just like how my fate when it comes to love.

Maybe in another life I would be lucky enough to experience it ðŸ˜Š.

I am just posting this because I have no one to talk to and even if I did I already know what they will say. So I hope this might be a lesson for some who are not moving on from that person. It's not worth it.
