Last night I found a man in my trunk, and I didn't put him there.

Let me start from the beginning. It was after midnight and I had just gotten off work. The warehouse is 24/7 and the night shift allows me to sleep all day. 

So I start my car and begin blaring my music, trying to perk myself awake for the thirty minute drive back home.

There was hardly any other roads on the car, so when I came to a red light I took a moment to change songs. You know when one song in particular has been playing in your head all day, and the only way to get rid of it is too play it?

Finally I find the song. My favorite song, "Yer killing me" by Remo Drive. Before it starts playing however, I hear a thump from the back of my car.

I have a bad habit of throwing water bottles, monster cans, and random other pieces of trash in my back seat.

I was sure it was just the sound of trash settling, or maybe I just imagined the sound. I checked the mirrors, and didn't see anything.

The light turns green and i take off, feeling slightly unsettled. I turned the music down and waited, but there was nothing. Problem solved, right? Wrong.

After a few minutes the thumping came back, to the rhythm of the music I was listening too. I turned the music completely off, but the thumping continued on.

I was full on freaking out know. Luckily there was a brightly lit gas station a ahead. I pulled up near the side entrance. With a deep breathe I clicked the button to open my trunk, but I stayed in the car.

My car has a back up camera, I put the car in reverse but didn't move it. Then I saw him.

He was tall, had long red hair. He was wearing a pretty nice black suit. He just picked himself out of my trunk, brushed himself off, and walked off.

Suffice to say I was close to crapping my pants. I peeled the hell put of there, not even bothering to close my trunk. I just drove home.

I spent the hours waiting for the cops to show up at my door. Wondering if the gas station attendent saw, or if the man who was in my trunk called them.

They didn't though. I finally fell asleep at 6:00 am. Before I left for work I checked my trunk, it was completely empty.

Satisfied I climbed into the driver seat, and did a cursory glance around the car. What I saw sent chills down my spine, the car was spotless, not a single piece of trash.

I wanted to call out of work, but I'm already on thin ice with my supervisor. I head to work in silence, not feeling like music. 

10 minutes in I here thumping again. I decide to ignore it, my trunk was empty there's no way anyone could have gotten in.

The sound doesnt stop. I'm crying by the time I get into the parking lot. I grab my purse and fling myself out of the car. I ran to the door and just before I went in, I hit the open trunk button. Then I went in, not turning to look.

Again I was paranoid for a few hours, throwing myself in my work. Usually on breaks I'll go out to my car to smoke some weed, but I stayed in the break room my first break.

Just before lunch my lead called a group meeting. Most of my coworkers were grumbling about being held up. I just felt a flare of anxiety, was I going to get arrested in front of everybody?

Sasha, my lead, started ranting about how we need to get our numbers up. She also said we need to work on attendance, while shooting me a pointed glare.

 "Finally, we have a new member on the team," she said, her voice getting friendlier "Mr. Todd is our new Manager, he's new to the company, let's all give him a hand."

I joined in the half-hearted applause, looking around to see this Mr. Todd. I knew him as soon I saw his flaming red hair. 

"Thank you, I'm excited to be here." Mr. Todd said in a deep voice, looking straight at me. "I'm sure with hard work, we're all going to go far"

I'm writing this in the bathroom now, I'm scared to go out there and I'm scared to run to my car. Someone has been pounding on the door for the past 5 minutes, in the tune to my favorite song.

What do I do?
