Me and my family (Me, my wife, son and daughter) were out on vacation in California. I had asked my friend Jack to watch the house and feed my cat. It had been a very long time since we got to vacation, with some recent financial trouble. The house wasn’t anything incredible, but it was home.

After about a week on vacation, we returned from our trip. We rode for about an hour, past the Florida seaside, before getting home. We couldn’t park in the driveway, as their was a car in the driveway stopping us from doing so. Weird. 

I looked inside and the house was a wreck. I panicked and told my family to stay outside. I started walking in, and walked up the stairs. There wasn’t anything missing, in any of the rooms, even some of our heirlooms. That made me feel better. But I was still confused by the wreck. Why the fuck was everything like this. 

I went into the living room and the TV was on. I was just frustrated. Like come on, I told the kids to turn it off before we left. It had some show about aardvarks on or something. I don’t know what it’s called, never watched it growing up. 

“Look outside”

What? It came from the TV. I looked and saw a character looking at me. A little boy, looked like a rabbit.

“Look outside”

The rabbit boy had a weird toothy grin, like some kind of monster.

“Look outside”

The aardvark said it now. He also had some weird grin.

“LOOK OUTSIDE”

They both said it together now. One of them had some weird smile on their face. The teeth was sharp, and the eyes were… HOLY SHIT THEIR BLEEDING. I’m frozen in terror. I can’t do anything.

“LOOK OUTSIDE”

The other had the same smile. Their voices were distorted beyond recognition.

“LOOK OUTSIDE

 LOOK OUTSIDE

 LOOK OUTSIDE

 LOOK OUTSIDE”

Finally, I look outside. I see my family out there. They had the same smile as the characters on the show. They stare at me and I just stand there. My little girl says “Hi daddy, want to join us? Wanna join us daddy?” 

I’m freaked out now and run to the door. I try to open the door and it won’t budge.

I run upstairs for the spare key. It’s on the side table in the little drawer. I open the drawer and it’s not there. Fuck.

I run back to the stairs and run down. I turn to my right into the kitchen. My son is in there.

“Hi daddy.”

“Hi Timmy. Weren’t you just outside? With… the face”

“Yes daddy. Wanna join us”

He walks slowly towards me. I walk backwards slowly confused. He them grows that creepy smile. His body changes. I’m panicking as suddenly he’s purely nothing, except for that smile, with blood coming from his mouth, and his eyes, red. 

“Where is my son?”

“Wanna join him?”

“Where is my family?”

“Wanna join them?”

It then lunged towards me. I grabbed the pan to my side and swung at it. The face disappeared.

I’m standing there in my kitchen, and I’m just thinking of a way out. I realize I could just go through that window from earlier. I run into the living room and jump through the window. 

Blood, everywhere. Glass everywhere. 

I look and run. I knock on the door of my neighbor across the way. I knock on the door and I’m answered by… nothing. 

“Hello?”

“Hi Jim”

I turned around and there was Jack. I was so happy. He was wearing beachwear, and had something behind his back.

“Dude, where have you been?”

“Oh, I took the cat and went to a beach.”

“Oh… why? You weren’t supposed to take her anywhere”

“Sorry, just wanted a fun day”

“Ok whatever, can I see my cat”

“Sure, she’s right here”

Jack grabs my cat from behind his back. The cat was dead, with a huge stab in the back. 

HOLY SHIT! THE CAT WAS DEAD, WITH A STAB IN THE BACK?

I look back up at Jack and he has that same smile. That same fucking smile.

“Wanna join her?”

I slapped the monster and ran back and jumped in the car. I started the car and just drove. I just needed to get out of here.

I drove for about 10 minutes before I heard from my side:

“Honey, where are we going?”

I turned and saw my wife. Was she there the whole time?

“Hi honey”

Then I realized. It was just that monster again. It was the monster. Of course.

“Where are we going?”

It didn’t know I knew yet. I took matters into my own hands. I crashed the car into the side of the road.



I woke up just for a second and saw my wife standing there. Full smile on my face, light shining on her back.






“He’s woken up”

I woke up in the hospital. I thought I was dead but I guess not. That’s not exactly great for me though. I was stuck, with a monster after me.

“Your daughter is here. Do you want to see her”

Oh god, it’s here.

“No please don’t”

Suddenly, my daughter runs in and smiles seeing me.

“Hi daddy!”

The doctor look at me happily.

“Aaaw, I’ll let you guys talk”

The doctor left and it was me and my daughter. I was panicking, and then it spoke:

“Looks like it’s time to join us”







(I know the story is bad I’m not very good at this)
