It had been weeks of strange occurrences, tiny whispers in the dark, objects shifting around the house, and a nagging feeling that I couldn’t shake. My daughter, Lily, had been talking about her “friend” again. She was only six, so I didn’t think much of it at first. Most kids have imaginary friends, right? But this one was different. 

Lily had been spending more and more time with her friend, often speaking in hushed tones, laughing to herself, and sometimes even seeming... frightened. It made me uneasy, but I told myself I was overthinking it. 

“You’re just tired,” I’d tell myself. But that night, when Lily came to me, her face pale and drawn, something in my gut told me this was different.

“Mommy,” she whispered, “please don’t let him hurt me.”

I felt a cold chill run down my spine, my heart skipping a beat. "Who, sweetie? Who’s going to hurt you?"

“The man in the corner,” she said, pointing to the dark corner of her room, where the shadows seemed to press in tighter than usual. “He says he’s my friend, but I don’t want to play with him anymore. He’s mean.”

I walked over to the corner, trying to mask the fear rising in my throat. There was nothing. Just shadows. 

“Honey, there’s no one there. It’s just your imagination. You’re safe.”

But the look on her face told me she wasn’t convinced.

“He wants to come out, Mommy. He says you’ll be sorry if you don’t let him.”

I smiled weakly, brushing her hair from her forehead. “He’s not real. We’ll talk about it in the morning.”

That night, I lay awake in bed, my mind swirling with a hundred thoughts. Was it just a phase? Was I overreacting? The whole thing felt wrong, though. Like something wasn’t quite right.

The next few days were worse. Lily refused to go near that corner. She began having nightmares—waking up in tears, crying about the man in the corner who wanted her to play, who told her things. Dark things. Things I didn’t want to hear. 

One night, I went into her room to find her curled up in a ball, her eyes wide with fear. I sat down next to her, smoothing her hair.

“What happened, Lily?” I asked, trying to keep my voice calm.

“I saw him again,” she whispered, trembling. “He’s standing there... in the corner. And he says... he says he likes to play with people, Mommy.”

I glanced toward the corner, but there was nothing there. Only the dark. The shadows.

“I’m right here,” I said, pulling her close, “and I won’t let anyone hurt you.”

Lily didn’t respond, her eyes locked onto the corner. I followed her gaze, my heart pounding. For a split second, I thought I saw something—just a flicker, a shadow that seemed to move. My blood ran cold. 

The next day, when I picked her up from school, Lily wasn’t waiting at the gate like usual. Instead, a teacher came up to me, her face ashen.

“Mrs. Peterson, you need to come with me.”

My heart sank. I followed her into the teacher’s lounge, where another staff member was sitting with Lily. Her face was pale, and her eyes were wide with terror.

“Lily? What happened?” I asked, kneeling in front of her.

She trembled. “He came to school. He told me to come with him.”

My stomach twisted into knots. “Who, honey? Who came to school?”

“The man,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “The man with the hat. He says he’s my friend, but he’s not. He’s not.”

I stared at her, unable to process the words. “Sweetheart, there’s no man. It’s all in your imagination. We’ve talked about this.”

The teacher spoke up. “Mrs. Peterson, we found something strange. Lily had written something on the back of her worksheet.” She handed me the paper. 

On it was a simple drawing—a tall man in a hat, with a dark, twisted smile. Beneath the drawing, in Lily’s shaky handwriting, it said:

*He will be here soon.*

I felt the blood drain from my face.

The following days were a blur of confusion and fear. I kept Lily home from school, hoping it was just a phase, hoping my daughter wasn’t losing her mind. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. That *he* was real. 

That night, I decided to confront whatever was haunting my child. I couldn’t keep running from this. I had to face it head-on. I stood at the door of her room, feeling the cold air pressing against my skin, the weight of the dark corner pressing on me. I didn’t know what I was expecting to see, but I had to know.

I took a deep breath and walked into the room, flipping on the light. The shadows shifted but nothing moved. Lily sat on her bed, staring at the corner, her face pale, eyes wide with terror.

“Lily,” I whispered, my voice trembling. “Where is he? Where is your friend?”

She didn’t answer. She just pointed.

And that’s when I saw it.

At first, I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me, but as I looked harder, the shape in the corner became clearer. A figure. A man. Tall, thin, dressed in old, tattered clothes. A dirty fedora perched atop his head, casting a shadow over his face.

The man looked at me, and my breath caught in my throat. He smiled, wide and sickly, revealing teeth that were too sharp, too jagged.

And then he spoke.

“Thank you for finally noticing, Mrs. Peterson.”

I stepped back, my heart hammering in my chest. My mouth went dry.

“What… what do you want?” I managed to croak.

The man’s smile twisted even further. “I want what I’ve always wanted. To play.”

But then, before I could scream, something shifted. His face... it wasn’t the man’s face anymore. 

It was *mine*. 

My face. My smile. My eyes.

I staggered backward, my knees giving out beneath me. The man—no, the thing—stepped forward, and I recognized the twisted smile from every nightmare I’d ever had. 

And then it whispered, “I’ve always been here, inside of you, hiding... waiting. You just had to let me out.”

My own voice, twisted and wrong, echoed back to me. “You... you killed them. All of them.”

The walls seemed to close in, and the truth crashed down on me like a tidal wave. The people who had gone missing in our town. The children who vanished. All the signs, the clues, the police reports, the whispers... it had all been there. It was me. I was the one who had been hiding the darkness inside me, buried deep down. 

The man wasn’t my daughter’s imaginary friend. *He was me.*

And the worst part? 

Lily wasn’t afraid. She was smiling, her little face glowing with something sinister, something that wasn’t childlike at all. 

“My real friend’s finally here, Mommy.”

I realized, too late, that I hadn’t been protecting my daughter from him.

She had been protecting me from *myself*.
