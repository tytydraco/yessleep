It was graduation night, my best friend Donna and I were cruising down the highway in my brand new 78 CJ blasting Night Fever by the Bee Gees.

“Berkeley here we come!” Donna shouted taking yet another drink from a pilfered bottle of champagne. She stood in the open top vehicle letting her long blonde hair whip in the wind. I couldn't help but grin, we were two young hotties feeling on top of the world! I looked back at the road just in time to see a large animal dart onto the highway, I never had a chance to even touch the brakes. The impact slammed me into the steering wheel. My head bounced off the windshield spider webbing the glass. I fell back into my seat stunned and bleeding. 

Slowly regaining my senses I turned to the seat beside me only to see it was empty, my adrenaline surging I threw the door open. I stumbled out onto the pitch black highway desperately searching for Donna. The night was silent save for a soft hiss emanating from the Jeeps ruptured cooling system. 
As my eyes began to adjust I frantically searched the empty road. Hearing a soft sob to my right I slid down the embankment. following the sound I spotted a bush, beside it lay my best friend, her arms wrapped tightly around herself. I couldn't make out much in the lack of light but she was alive! 

I dropped to my knees beside her “Donna I’m so so sorry!” I tried to help her into a sitting position but she cried out in pain. “It’s going to be ok” I reassured her “I'll get help. I’ll fix this”. I frantically looked around trying to figure out how would do just that. 

“Crystal” Donna whimpered “Crystal I can't feel my legs, my guts hurt and I can't feel my legs”. Tears filled my eyes “it's ok Donna, I'll get help. We can't be more than a couple miles from the last gas station. Your dad is the best doctor on the California coast. He'll have you all patched up in no time”. I held her tight as we both began to sob. 

She started to shiver violently despite the warm spring breeze. I gently shook her “hang in there Donna, I'm going to grab the picnic blanket. I'll be right back”. She gave my hand a squeeze “I’ll try not to wander off” she joked weakly. 

I scrambled up to the now silent Jeep as quickly as I could. Pulling the thin plaid blanket from under the rear seat I stood. My eyes had grown accustom to the dark I could make out the form of a large animal laying behind the Jeep. 

I realized the Jeep must have ran it over after the impact, looking at the size of it I was surprised we hadn't flipped. It's dark hair was long and silky, the breeze gently blowing it side to side. There was a trail of entrails strung down the highway as well as a massive pool of blood under it. It had the shape and build of a dog but was the size of a grizzly bear. 

A scream pierced the night, forgetting the blanket I sprinted in Donna's direction. 

I froze at the edge of the road. I couldn't will my body forward. Donna lay where I left her but behind her stood a freak of nature. It had the ears of a wolf but the short snout of a bear. It's glowing yellow eyes were fixated on Donna, it’s knife like teeth barred in her face. While much smaller than the dead one on the road it still dwarfed Donna’s crippled form. She screamed again as it laid a massive paw on her chest. My knees began to tremble at the sight of it’s long curved claws. 

In a flash it forced it’s claws threw her chest, her screams turned to gurgling as blood spurted from her dying body coating the creatures chest. Donna's body convulsed violently on the ground before becoming still. 
I started screaming, at first I wasn’t even aware it my voice doing it. The creature jumped in surprise before jerking it's head up to look in my direction. It's yellow eyes seemed to pierce right through me. 

What happened next caused my knees to go weak. It stood, the wolf bear stood up like a man. It's chest was double the width of a linebacker, its legs were as thick as tree trunks. The whole body was rippling with muscles visible beneath the silky hair. 

My body started running, it took a moment for my mind to catch up but once it did I knew I had to escape. There was a cold intelligence in those eyes that scared me more than the claws and teeth. 

I made it to the Jeep just as the creature reached the road. It was moving purposefully, in no hurry to end me on it’s own terms. 
Praying fervently I turned the key. Nothing happened, I tried again. Not even a click. Nearly blinded by tears I watched the creature slowly draw closer. It seemed to smile in the presence of my fear.

Suddenly remembering to depress the clutch pedal I tried again. The little four by four roared to life! I screamed out a triumphant “yes!” 

Wasting no time I slammed the stick into reverse. The Jeep sped backwards only to slam into the dead beast behind me. The creature in front bellowed in rage.

I popped it into four wheel drive and mashed the accelerator to the floor. Blood and fur sprayed the creature in front of me as the Jeep spun over it's dead companion. 
Seeing the creature was momentarily blinded I took the opportunity to pull a “J” turn. I managed to take off just as the creature lunged for me. It's claws narrowly missing the rear bumper. 

I had the engine pinned wide open as I fled. My heart still racing and my mind a mess of thoughts and fears I didn't notice the flashing light on my dash. The temp gauge was pegged and there was a knock coming from under the hood. 

The Jeep began to lose speed, panicking I down shifted trying to keep the engine alive. Still it’s speed further decreased. With a bang and clatter of metal pieces the engine seized causing the back tires to lock up. I popped it into neutral and coasted for a couple hundred yards. 

I sat there gripping the steering wheel too scared to look behind me. A glance in the rear view mirror showed only darkness. 

I needed to move, fast and far. If the creature was still chasing me I couldn't waste my head start. Reaching back I grabbed the tire iron and I started running. Two years of track and volleyball were about to pay off. 

The night was quiet save for the slap of my sneakers on the pavement and my labored breathing. I focused on my pace, if I didn’t push too hard I could manage a couple miles without a break.

Pacing my self went out the window when I heard a blood curdling howl rip through the night.  The creature had caught up much faster than I had anticipated. I was still close enough to hear the smashing of glass as it destroyed the Jeep. 

I ran at a full sprint, I pushed every ounce of strength I had into my legs. My lungs were screaming and my vision blurry but I pressed on. 

I don't know how far I made it before one foot hooked behind the other and I was launched face first into the pavement. I lay there gasping for air. Despair was welling up inside me, I wasn’t ready to die! Especially not at the hand of some monster still soaked in my friends blood. 

Before panic managed to truly take hold of me I saw a dim light through the trees. Looking closely as the pines waved to and fro I saw another. Street lights! 

Without a second thought I tore through the woods ignoring both the thorns and branches that ripped my clothes and dug into my flesh. Ahead lay salvation! All I had to do was reach it before that creature caught me. 

The lights twinkled ahead of me, luring me in with their promise of civilization and safety. Another howl erupted, the beast had found where I had left the highway. I found myself in awe at how much emotion could be discerned through it's primitive form of communication. 
The first outburst had been filled with rage and hatred, this one held tones of hunger. Of a desire to exact harsh revenge. 

I wouldn't be giving it the satisfaction. l stumbled onto a freshly paved road, it's sickly sweet smell permeating the night air. Ahead stood evenly spaced multi story wooden structures. My heart dropped into my stomach. They weren't complete houses, this was a construction site not a neighborhood. 

I was spurred ahead by the sounds of something large crashing through the bushes. I ran to the nearest house with fully erect walls. Despite fumbling with the door latch I managed to open it just as the beast exploded from the tree line.

Our eyes made contact, I could see a pure and savage joy in those yellow orbs. I slammed the door shut as it began it's sprint in my direction.

I took in my surroundings, exposed wires and plumbing ran through the naked studs leaving no where to hide. Upstairs felt like my only option, I ran up just as heavy steps hit the front porch. 

Not a second later the front door was ripped from the wall and cast aside. I held still, not even willing to breath as the beast entered. It had to stoop as it came through the door but was able to stand freely once inside. 
It sniffed twice then emitted a deep growl. My heart beat even faster as it walked to the stairs. They groaned in protest as it took them one slow step at a time.

I crept back from the stairwell, as I did my hand brushed something. It was a discarded two by four, maybe four feet in length. Thinking quickly I grabbed it with both hands, just as the beasts awful head became visible I swung with all my might!

First it yelped in pain as the board cracked over it’s skull, then it cried out in surprise as it lost it’s footing and crashed back down the stairs. 

My hands were ringing from the impact but I had done it! My triumph was short lived however, rage filled roars echoed up from the first floor. 

I ran for the front window, the empty hole led onto a small roof. I climbed out quickly, behind me wood was splintering and flying across the house as the beast charged up the stairs using all four limbs. 

I jumped from the roof landing on a pile of dirt nearby. Above me the beast had wedged itself in the window hole. 

I took this moment to grab a one foot piece of rebar. The beast froze, it watched me with suspicion as I took my stance. 
Winding up I took my shot, the bar spun end over end before striking true. The beast screamed in pain as the metal sunk deep into it’s left eye. I had no time to celebrate, in it’s pain fueled rage the beast tore itself free and lunged for me. 

Spinning to the side I was nearly fast enough, three of it’s claws slid across my stomach. The tank top I was wearing offered no protection, I doubled over as the lines turned red. 

I had no time to inspect my wounds, I dove into the nearest crawlspace. The beast reached for me blindly, it swung it’s enormous arm around the dark space. I crawled away from the entrance, tears once again coursing down my face. 

My stomach burned where I had been clawed. I put my hand to it and it came away wet. I didn’t need a light to know it was blood. 
Behind me the beast was tearing at the concrete foundation, breaking off small chunks at a time with it’s long claws. 
I felt trapped, sooner rather than later it would get in and I wouldn’t be able to avoid it for long. I curled up and crossed my arms over my bleeding abdomen. 

The snarls seemed to fade as I lay there. I had crawled into a hole with no way out. This was how I was going to die, I would be pulled apart and devoured. 

I rolled onto my back and looked up. Rather than  there being a subfloor above me I was staring at an opening. There was an indoor crawl access! Suddenly filled with the desire to live I sprang into action.

I climbed up into the unfinished house above . Below me I could here the beast navigating the small space. It growled in frustration as it searched for me. Time and time again it bonked it’s head on a beam and released a roar of frustration. 

I grabbed a tool pouch that was hanging near by, I threw a board over the access hole and began nailing it closed. 

The beasts arm shot through the gap nearly severing my hand! It grasped the floor in an attempt to pull it’s self up. I swung the hammer with all my might, the first blow landed with a crack between it’s eyes. The second time I swung I sunk the claw clean through it’s wrist and pinned it to the floor!
At that point I ran, behind me the house was filled with pained roars. I didn’t stop, I ran in the direction of the highway. 

The evening faded after that, before reaching the road I saw flashing red and blue lights. I pushed myself to head in their direction.
I later learned that a truck had stopped at my wrecked Jeep, he called the highway patrol with his CB radio. They told me they had heard strange animalistic noises far in the woods, they were getting ready to call search and rescue when I came crawling out of the woods covered in blood and dirt.

Donna’s body was never found, the official story is that we hit a bear although the body of the first creature disappeared as well. I was then consequently mauled by the bear before it ran into the woods possibly taking Donna’s body with it. 

I still have the scars across my stomach to this day, they have faded to the point that I just tell people they’re from my C section. Only my husband knows what really happened that night. 

That was forty four years ago, the reason I bring it up is because of my daughter. She’s twenty two, her and her boyfriend went camping for a week. The night before last she called me saying a giant one eyed bear had destroyed their truck.

They were stranded in the mountains not even fifty miles from where I had my experience. She told me the bear looked wrong, that it had destroyed the  truck then seemed to grin as it walked back into the woods on two legs. 
I’ve called everyone I can think of, my husband and I each bought a rifle and are heading that way as soon as I post this. 

I don’t know how true the stories on here are but hope at least one of the supposed monster hunters are the real deal because we need help. No one can find our baby. Please, help us kill the beast of [REDACTED] Forest. We will pay you everything we have.
