In the boondocks of South Wales, my wife and I found ourselves on a late-night road trip to see her parents. We were joyously singing along to Bohemian Rhapsody as we followed the bend of a seemingly-ceaseless country lane.

“We’ve been curving for a solid couple of minutes… This doesn’t make sense. We should’ve completed a full circle by now,” I said, whilst my wife, Jade, carried on singing. “Should we head back the way we came?”

Before Jade could reply, our Bluetooth radio transmitter began to pick up external interference. A woman’s quivering voice poured through the speakers in a garbled whisper.

“… in the… ahead…”

That was all we could discern before Bohemian Rhapsody resumed. But Jade stopped singing, and the two of us looked at one another with wide, terrified eyes.

“What the fuck was that?” My wife asked.

I gulped, putting on a brave face. “It was… It was just interference. Probably someone else’s Bluetooth transmitter set to the same frequency as ours.”

“That woman sounded… scared,” Jade whispered.

“It was just a radio station… or a Halloween podcast,” I said. “Let’s figure out how to get off this road… Come on, Google Maps! Why is there no signal out here?”

Jade stopped the music as I pulled over to the side of the road. Whilst I fiddled with my phone, I became all-too-aware of my wife’s increasingly-agitated breathing.

“Right, I’m doing a three-point turn,” I said, gently toeing the accelerator and spinning the steering wheel sharply to the right. “This road is a fucking nightmare.”

“Danny… Does that look different to you?” Jade asked as I turned the car around.

“Nothing about this road has looked different for the past 5 minutes,” I replied.

“Not the road,” Jade whispered. “It’s so dark outside. The moon’s vanished.”

I peered at the sky through my upper windshield. It wasn’t dark out there. It was black. There was not a speck of light in sight.

“It’s… I… The moon must be covered by clouds,” I stuttered uncertainly.

But as we drove back the way we came, my sturdy demeanour entirely disintegrated — I felt the same horror as my wife. After following the endless road for several minutes, without returning to the junction that led us onto that cursed circuit, I could no longer deny what Jade had already accepted.

We were trapped.

But we weren’t stuck on a revolving, repeating loop. Things changed along that road. The slightest things. An occasional star would appear then disappear, and road signs emerged with strange, senseless messages.

*No driving on this road.*

*No lefts or rights.*

*Stop for hitchhikers.*

“What do these signs mean?” Jade whimpered.

Suddenly, the car speakers crackled, and the woman’s distorted voice returned with a renewed ferocity.

“… behind…”

As I glanced at my rearview mirror, I screamed until my lungs faltered. There was a gangly, pale, black-eyed woman behind our car. She was standing in the middle of the road, and she rapidly disappeared around the corner of the ever-curving road as we drove away.

I couldn’t help noticing that she was wearing an identical gingham dress to the one Jade was wearing. Identical hair. Identical…

It was my wife.

“What?” Jade shrieked, swivelling around in her seat. “What did you see, Danny?”

“We need to get off this road,” I shuddered. “We need to get off this fucking road, Jade.”

And then another sign appeared, reading:

*Don’t drive under the influence of Earth. Let us take the wheel.*

A man was peering around the side of the metal poles which supported the rusty, red sign. He bore black eye sockets like those of the woman. They seemed to be bleeding blackened tears onto his lifeless cheeks, and he wore an outfit identical to mine.

As we neared the inhuman monstrosity, his mouth gaped open, and I felt an inexplicable pull — as if my very soul were being inhaled. My free will dissipated. I felt a desire to pull over and hand the car keys over to the doppelgänger.

Desperate to flee the thing, I slammed my foot down and watched as the speedometer climbed gradually from 40mph to 60mph.

“Who was that man?” Jade screeched. “Pull over… Pull over, Danny!”

I wanted to protest, but my wife’s face had turned a spectacular shade of green. Most of the vomit ended up across the dashboard, but I managed to pull to the side of the road in time for her to leap out of the car and finish on the grass.

She took a moment to recover — hands on her knees as she panted in a laboured manner. The trees and shrubbery billowed furiously in the wind, and yet it was a silent wind. There was no sound in that unearthly place. No light, other than my car’s front beams. Everything about that road horrified me.

“Get back inside, Jade,” I said shakily.

Jade took a second to respond, but she quickly composed herself and returned to the car. I wasted no time scorching rubber against gravel, speeding along that lifeless road to nowhere.

Jade gripped her seat in fear. “Slow down, Danny! This lane is too narrow to be driving so… so… Wait…”

I saw it too.

“Is that a car?” I asked.

The red glow of not-so-distant bumper lights spilled onto the road ahead of us — cast by a vehicle just out of view. But no matter how fast I drove, it was always around the corner. Always out of reach.

“Hello?” Jade said.

I turned to see my wife speaking into her phone, and I realised she’d reconnected to the Bluetooth transmitter.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

“Maybe the driver of that car was the person we could hear on the radio earlier,” Jade suggested. “I’m trying to talk to them… Hello? Can you hear me?”

No response.

“Are you in the car ahead of us? How do we get off this road?” My wife whispered, trembling.

It was a familiar whisper. And that was when a coldness spread through my body.

“Honey…” I started.

“— Do you hear me? Behind you!” She cried, clutching her phone tightly.

“It’s you, Jade!” I wailed. “The woman on the radio… It was you from the beginning.”

Jade’s eyes widened, and she slowly turned to face me. I could see that she understood. Perhaps she’d already known — that would explain her terror from the very moment we heard the voice on the radio. Her instincts had been on fire.

“But… how?” She whispered. “How could it have been me… before I’d even…”

I couldn’t answer her question, but a possible solution came to me. Every sign alongside that haunted road contained a thinly-veiled threat — messages that seemed to contradict anything safe or sensible. And that gave me a terrible idea.

No lefts or rights.

“I think we need to turn off the road,” I said.

Jade raised an eyebrow, offering me an exasperated look. “Where?”

I turned my head to the left, peering into the darkness beyond the trees which lined the road of our cyclical hellscape.

*Let us take the wheel.*

I think the road wanted to replace us. Turning off it would contradict everything that it had told us to do. And that was good enough for me.

Before my wife could protest, I swerved through an opening between two trees, driving onto a soft, grassy bank. The sky overhead remained blackened, as did the expansive field on which we suddenly found ourselves. But I didn’t care about that. We were free of the road, which was all that mattered to me in that moment.

“Look!” I cried, nodding my head at a splatter of lights in the distance. “I think that’s—“

“— The motorway!” Jade gasped.

I held my breath as the car’s tyres squelched across sodden fields. But as we finally reached the embankment leading up to the motorway, my body unclenched at the prospect of returning to the real world. Our world.

And sure enough, we rejoined traffic — we rejoined reality. Jade and I cried jubilantly. I only wish I hadn’t glanced at my wife’s reflection in the rearview mirror.

Perhaps it would’ve been better not to know.

Perhaps it would’ve been better not to see the black tears spilling from blacker eye sockets.
