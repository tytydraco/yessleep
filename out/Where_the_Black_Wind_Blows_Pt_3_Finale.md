**Mary III**

Day had turned to night and Mary still had not received any texts or calls from Rose, who usually made it a point to let her know when she had made it home. The anxiety of it all was awful, as she could only venture to guess at how pissed Rose still was at her. After all, Mary had basically told her to fuck off and not come back, something which ultimately went against her own interests. The storm which had started the moment that Rose left didn’t help things, and although the rain had subsided, the wind still howled as if it possessed a mind of its own. It was a little bit eerie, being alone in that old house with nature itself making an effort to tear the place apart. Every once in a while the whole building would tremble as particularly strong gusts struck it. 

Mary reluctantly headed to her bedroom, worried by the idea that anything could happen in her sleep. The building itself could come down around her while she was at her most vulnerable, made all the more plausible by the ever-increasing intensity of the wind. She normally would be kept up all night by storms such as this one, preparing herself for the worst, but the day had taken a lot out of her. The fight she had was beyond mentally taxing. Sleep was overriding her fear at almost the same pace as the rain which continued to patter upon the ground. Mary tried to fight it, but the lull of unconsciousness was quickly winning out. She closed her eyes one last time, the symphony of mother nature still playing outside, and drifted off into a wholly new nightmare.

Bad dreams were not uncommon to Mary, and had become such a staple of her time in the unconscious world that she had more than once been able to gain awareness of the dream while experiencing it. There would be no such luck here, as she sat up in her bed, listening to the howling of the wind. Her eyes were only barely adjusted to the darkness, but it was just enough for her to be able to see paint being stripped away. It was sliding off the walls like the wax of a lit candle, cascading onto the floor in wet lumps and leaving bare wood in its wake. Mary tried to rush out of bed, but was only barely able to move. It was as if she had wandered into quicksand, the great weight of all that peat and mud sucking her down. There is little to describe the terror she felt. To have no control over your own surroundings, and to watch them be torn away. For a place of comfort to lose its lustre and become another haunting memory. 

The wind seemed to gain a will of its own, the pure force of it pushing Mary out of bed, her knees landing harshly on the splintering wood. She tried to cry out in pain, but no sound emerged. It was an indescribable force, a malicious black wind blowing through her body, robbing her of what little happiness she had left. Mary had already been convinced the moment her parents died that the world was against her, this only serving to cement that sentiment. What had she ever done to deserve a life governed by anything and everything but herself? What use did the world have to saddle her with a fear of everything that could happen? The utter unfairness of it all was maddening.

Mary hesitantly got up from the ground, still moving slowly and deliberately, gravity’s force feeling like it had been magnified tenfold. The paint continued to slough off the walls, leaving them as only husks of their former selves. Wind shrieked through the open door and into the house, uprooting slats of wood from the floor as it went, almost like a shark’s fin carving through stillwater. The black wind continued its path of destruction through the house, and Mary could only watch as family portraits were tossed from their places. They unceremoniously shattered upon the ground, and the basement door too was ripped from its rusty hinges, its red hue seeming to drain as the wind whipped against it. Before she could as much as blink the door had been bisected and thrown to the side. If anyone or anything was able to take the place of the house which was being subjected to such violence, Mary would wish it to be so.

As Mary stumbled forward into the living room, cavernous gouges appeared from the remnants of the scattered floorboards, going further down than even the deepest layer of the house. It was somehow collapsing both inward and outward at the same time. The red antique chair that had been in the house since her grandparents first bought it suffered a similar fate to the other amenities. It had deep grooves sliced into its flesh, causing a mess of kidneys, intestines, and lungs to spill out. Such a thing shouldn’t have been possible, yet there it was, in front of Mary’s very eyes. Seeing it in such a state was tantamount to watching a friend pass away. Sure it was an inanimate object, but it was one of the only things Mary could say was hers. 

Once the building had been stripped of everything needed to call a place “home”, the wind began to pull apart its very skeleton. Mary’s vocal chords were unwilling to produce the guttural pain she felt as she bore witness to the foundations of her childhood being flung skyward. It reminded her of the fear she felt when watching *The Wizard of Oz* as a child, seeing the house being lifted into the open air by a tornado with Dorothy still in it. Mary almost wished that were the case, as everything but her was pulled out of the ground. Swirling dust and debris sent broken planks of wood and glass out of view. It was almost a paradox, the way things moved just slow enough for Mary to see it all, but just fast enough that it overwhelmed her senses. Once all was said and done, there was nothing left. In the moment, more than anything, Mary wished she could disappear without a trace. What was the point, living in a world where everything special can be taken away so easily, and without any say in the matter? 

With that thought, Mary shot up in bed, her nightmare mercifully cut short by her alarm. Her clock read 6:00 AM, which was not out of the ordinary given her preference to wake up early. As Mary took in the slightly peeling paint on the walls, she breathed a sigh of relief. The house was still standing, with no magical wind to tear it apart. She almost started laughing at herself and at the ridiculousness of the dream. It’s funny, how the visions you see while you sleep can be so convincing, despite having no basis in reality. Speaking of reality, there was no sound of wind nor rain to be heard. Allowing herself a small glance outside, Mary saw that although it looked gloomy, there were no storm clouds in sight. She quickly closed the blinds, feeling the pulse of anxiety that always came with looking outside the house, but still retained a small measure of joy. Sure it was the joy of knowing a dream was just a dream, yet that hardly made a difference in the moment.

Mary checked her phone, seeing if Rose had tried to call or text while she slept. There were no notifications to be found. This was pretty concerning, especially in light of the previous day’s fight. As much as she hated to admit it, she still needed Rose, so patching things up as soon as possible was the only real option. Mary hovered over the call button, but quickly backpedalled from the prospect. It’s not like she would be awake anyway, so it would just be a waste of time. The best thing Mary could do was to just leave a message. Might as well get it over with, she wasn’t going to allow one fight to ruin her life. 

“Hey Rose, can we please talk sometime today? I wanted to apologize for what I said while you were visiting,” Mary texted, hesitating for a moment before tapping to send. She wasn’t even sure how sorry she truly felt about the stuff she said. Some of it might have been going a little bit far, but in the same vein some of it felt perfectly valid. Mary would have to bullshit a bit during the call to make the apology seem convincing, so it would be best to focus on the stuff she actually felt guilty about saying. As much as she didn’t want to take advantage of her sister’s better nature, what other option did she have? There was no one else willing to care for her in the same way that Rose was, and she was not going to spend any amount of time in a mental facility if she could help it. Mary’s fear had been nurtured to the point where there was no unwinding it from her being. No amount of seeking professional help could fully put it to rest. Mary could even recognize the irrationality of that sentiment, but knowing something to be irrational does little to prevent it from being perpetuated.

“I love you,” Mary texted, before flipping her phone over so that it was facing down. She didn’t want to see the eventual response when it came. Was the statement even true at this point? Whatever the case, it left Mary with little to do other than wait. That was her life now, an infinite cycle of waiting. Waiting for others to help, and never feeling like she was able to help herself. When would she be able to give instead of take? When would the guilt end? The guilt of feeling like a burden was much to bear. Almost too much.

**Rose III**

A hospital is never the sort of place you want to wake up in, but sometimes it just can’t be helped. Rose groaned as she felt every muscle and bone ache in tandem with her arrival back to consciousness. As she blinked sleep out of her eyes, she noticed a heavy cast on her right arm. Scanning around the room, Rose also saw an anxious man sitting on an uncomfortable looking chair in the corner. It took her eyes another second of adjustment to realize who it was.

“Jonah?” Rose croaked, feeling parched from however long she had been asleep.

“Yep,” Jonah said, putting on a forced smile. He was glad that she trusted him enough to have him on an emergency contacts list, but it was disheartening to see her like this. Rose had suffered at least two broken bones, and likely wouldn’t be able to walk properly for a couple months. Sure, he could be there for her, but that didn’t change how long recovery would take. Sometimes Jonah wished that people could shrug off injuries like they do in films. Perhaps that was a stupid way of looking at things, melding fiction with reality, but he didn’t really care at the moment. Idealism wasn’t a bad trait to have as long as it was in moderation

“Could you please get me a glass of water?” Rose asked.

“I have one next to me on the desk if you want it. I drank out of it a little bit earlier, I hope you won’t mind,” Jonah responded, getting out of his chair and bringing the glass over.

“That’s fine.”

Rose gingerly sipped from the cup, some of the life returning to her eyes as she did. She was hurting pretty bad, broken bones and all, but the satisfaction of a bit of water during a bout of dehydration would never go unappreciated. She took in her surroundings with a little more lucidity, seeing the dull fluorescents and ceiling tiles speckled with decorative black dotting. It was certainly a hospital all right. Rose’s eyes widened, and she uncontrollably trembled for a second as she looked at the state of her lower body.

“I know it seems pretty bad, but I talked to one of the nurses while you were asleep and they said you’ll only need a few months to fully recover,” Jonah added, trying to sound reassuring. It clearly wasn’t working. 

“That explains why I feel so doped up right now, god knows what sorts of painkillers I’m on,” Rose said, a pained smile appearing on her face. It was a smile devoid of happiness. The sort of smile one uses to cope with something too difficult to deal with in the moment. Her smile dropped as fast as it came. “Wait, fuck.”

“What is it?” Jonah asked, his brow creased with concern.

“Mary. I have to take care of her, but I won’t be able to like this. I should let her know what happened,” Rose said gravely, every ounce of composure gone.

“Are you sure you want to do that right now? I mean, you did say you got into a pretty nasty fight earlier…” Jonah considered.

“I don’t give a shit. This is more important than whatever lingering feelings I may have from earlier. It’s best she knows now so that she can figure something out. Maybe there’s someone else that can take my place for a while,” Rose said, still deadly serious.

“Is she completely unwilling to leave the house?” Jonah asked, his curiosity winning out over his restraint.

Rose sighed, considering for a second before answering, “I’ll put it this way. She hasn’t left the house once since she turned 24. This has been going on for four years now. It started out even before, but it didn’t get really bad until then.”

“I don’t know if I should ask this either, but how did it get so bad?” Jonah asked tersely, a little worried that he was prying too much.

“It started small, around when me and her turned 18. Mary was always kinda anxious, even in high school, but she didn’t really start to hide herself away until she became an adult. At first it was just her staying indoors more, and she quit her customer focused job for a graveyard shift where she wouldn’t have to interact with anyone. It only intensified from there, though…” Rose said, looking deep in thought. “Are you sure you want to hear about all this?”

“I mean, yeah. You never really talk about your family, and admittedly I’ve been curious for the longest time,” Jonah said, deciding to be honest and upfront.

“Well, it got to a point where she was 20 years old and still working dead-end jobs. She stopped focusing on looking at colleges entirely, and my parents probably let a lot more slide than they should have. I guess they couldn’t really have anticipated how bad it would get. They loved her too much to force her to get help. I think they were afraid that she would hate them, not that it matters now. I think she was the favorite between the two of us,” Rose said sadly. It was not something she wanted to be thinking about right now, even if it was arguably true. 

“I’m… I’m sorry to hear that,” Jonah said, not knowing what else to say. How do you even respond to that?

“It’s fine. It doesn’t bother me too much anymore. You know, my parents didn’t even know they were gonna have twins. They just expected one girl, who they were going to name Rosemary. It’s funny, they just split the original name apart into two names, Rose and Mary. It was even an inside joke between them. Whenever they needed both of us to come down for dinner or whatever else, they would just call the name ‘Rosemary’. I never got why until they told me offhandedly one day,” Rose said, finishing her walk down memory lane. 

“That’s a lot to take in,” Jonah said, trying to mentally keep up.

“Well, you’re the one who asked,” Rose stated, cocking her eyebrow rather dramatically. This caused both her and Jonah to lightly chuckle, although she regretted it immediately as her entire body was racked with pain at the vibrations of the laugh. 

“Do you think things can get better with Mary?” Jonah asked soberly.

“Honestly, I don’t really know anymore. I think she’s fully convinced herself that she’s beyond help. That she’s just going to live the rest of her life like that. Me and my parents did try to stage a sort of intervention once, but it didn’t go over well. We sort of gave up after that, and just started doing what we could to make her comfortable since she wasn’t leaving the house anymore. And now I’m the only one left to do that…” Rose said, a deep sadness creeping in. “Speaking of which, I need to call her right now.”

“Your phone got smashed in the crash, so you’re gonna have to either use one of the hospital phones or borrow mine,” Jonah said.

“You’ve got to be shitting me. She doesn’t ever pick up calls from unknown numbers,” Rose said, putting her face in her hands. Out of all the things that could happen, why this, and why now?

“Hold on, I might have an idea,” Jonah said, the gears in his head turning as a plan started to form. “How about I stop by Mary’s place tomorrow and let her know what happened. Maybe I can take over for a while.”

“You would be willing to do that?” Rose asked, feeling an ounce of hope for the first time in what felt like forever.

“Of course. I’m not just going to let your sister be neglected, especially now that I know how hard things have been for both of you. I have quite a few days off I can use, so it shouldn’t conflict too badly with work,” Jonah responded. It was the least he could do in the current situation. It wasn’t about having Rose indebted to him as much as it was guilt. He hadn’t been there for his previous partner when times were rough, and that didn’t end so well. He was not going to make that mistake again. Although there was no undoing the past, Jonah could at least try to make a better future for himself and others in his life. The smile Rose gave him at his response made it all worth it.

“I guess in the meantime I’ll see about ordering myself a new phone,” Rose said, still smiling. Jonah really was full of surprises sometimes. “I should probably talk to the doctor as well.”

“Do you want me to get him?” Jonah asked.

“Yes. Please. It’s not like I’m in any state to get up and ask for him myself,” Rose said, once again covering her pain with humor. Regardless, it seemed like things were looking up. Maybe this would even give Mary the push she needed to start seeking out some help. Wishful thinking, perhaps, but the thought still counted. This cloud could have a silver lining after all.

**Rosemary (Epilogue)**

It had now been a full two days without any contact from Rose. Mary had not even been graced with a “seen” below her texts, and it was starting to push her beyond worry. It was one thing for her to still be pissed, but even at her most angry, Rose was never known to neglect common courtesy. She knew how much Mary depended on her, so it was frankly strange for a thing such as this to happen. After all, Rose was the fulcrum upon which Mary’s way of living rested. It would be a little cruel to make it seem as if that was in jeopardy. Maybe she was just trying to make Mary sweat a bit, although that wouldn't make sense given the apology had already been sent out. Whatever the case, she couldn’t stand it for much longer

The usual comfort brought by the house was sorely lacking, being replaced by a strange coldness. For the first time in a while, Mary felt nothing as she glanced at the various childhood portraits on the walls. The usual warmness they granted had waned in a single night. It was uncanny how these objects of nostalgia became dull reminders without anything tangibly changing. A burst of panic overtook Mary. What would need to be done for things to go back to how they were? How was she supposed to live her life, especially when the only thing she actually valued was the house? At this point, the place was little more than a ball and chain disguised as a home, yet Mary couldn’t help but cherish it as she did her own life. In fact, she would be willing to give up her own life before she gave up the house. It is a certain type of hell, knowing that a meritless attachment is completely unbreakable despite how much it holds you back. 

Above all things, it hurt to realize that she loved the house more than her own sister. Perhaps all those years of grief had inoculated her against human connection. Still, to cherish an inanimate object to a greater degree than a person brought an untold amount of guilt. Mary had long come to terms with the fact that she shouldn’t feel that way, but the feeling persisted regardless. Trying to deceive herself into believing anything different was a pointless endeavor; her heart well and truly had more fondness for the family house than anything else. It cut deep to know that such a belief was not receptive to change.

Mary’s thoughts drifted back to the dream she had experienced the other night. Perhaps it had been preferable to reality, for a black wind to come and ruin everything instead of the world coming down on its own. In the dream, there had been something to blame for all the bad. An antagonistic force was much easier to cope with than an indifferent universe. With that thought, Mary remembered the wish she had made in the dream. The wish to disappear. Would it be such a bad thing, to disappear without a trace? All worries could be left behind as if they were particles of dust on a windy beach. Was reality really all that preferable to nonbeing? She was sick of living a life as the passenger instead of the driver. The control she had was never there to begin with. 

Mary made a familiar wish once more.



Jonah reached the house a lot quicker than he expected to. Traffic hadn’t been so bad, and the only real issue was finding the road that led to the place. It was about as sad looking as he thought it would be, what with the barn seeming as if it was about to topple over, and the house itself appearing ancient at a first glance. He walked up the three steps that led to the front door, each one creaking under the pressure. He went to knock on the door, but hesitated for a second. It would probably look a little weird, some random guy banging on your door. After a moment, Jonah overcame his self consciousness and rapped against the door three times. Nothing. He gave the chipped surface another round of knocks, and still got nothing in return.

“Hey, Mary! I’m um… I’m Rose’s boyfriend. She’s indisposed right now and asked me to swing by,” Jonah yelled, hoping it would resound throughout the house.

After a while of deliberation, he turned the doorknob. The door opened with a satisfying click. It was a little bit strange, how the door was just unlocked like that. He cautiously walked in, cringing at each creak of the floorboards. The last thing he wanted to do was look like an intruder.

“Mary! Are you in here?” Jonah asked loudly, again waiting for a response. He was greeted instead with more silence.

Jonah continued to slowly walk around the house, even doubling back a few times to make sure he hadn’t missed any rooms. If what Rose said about Mary never wanting to leave the house was true, then she had to be here somewhere. The bedroom, kitchen, living room, and basement were all empty. The only noise anywhere in the building was the dull whirring of a generator in the basement. If not for that, the house would have appeared as being long abandoned. The silence was eerie, with even the sounds of nature having stilled themselves into inaudibility. Unsure of what to do, Jonah left, intending to go back to the hospital to share the news with Rose. The emptiness was bizarre, given all he had been made aware of. There was no one to be found in that house. 

There was no one to be found in that house. No one at all.
