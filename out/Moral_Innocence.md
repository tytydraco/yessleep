The walls were made of damp stone with patches of fungi growing in the darker areas. A distant sound of water droplets echoed off the walls. The air was cool and a small open window with bars let in a slight breeze that kept the room from feeling stagnant. An elderly man sat on a small bed in the corner, the frame was wooden and the mattress was barely more than laying on the wooden frame itself. The man was in a confused state with no recognition of where he was or how he got there. He eagerly looked around the room for answers or signs of familiarity.

“Where…where am I?”, he mumbled to himself as he looked down at his clothes. He was dressed in a black and white striped shirt and pants to match. To his left he noticed that there was no stone wall, but instead a barrier made of iron bars with a layer of rust. His confusion only worsened at this point, but one thing he knew for sure was that he was sitting in a prison cell. He stood up from his bed and struggled to walk to the bars, feeling old and malnourished. He grasped the iron and put his face to it, attempting to peer in both directions in hopes of seeing someone else who could provide answers, but nobody was around. He cried out for his wife, not sure if he would get a response, “Ruth? Ruth, what’s happening?”. There was no reply except for the faint echo of his own voice and the repeated dripping of a single water droplet. He returned back to his bed and sat down, now noticing a white beard that was particularly longer than he had ever grown before. He was frightened by the discovery that he was much older than he recollected. His hands were veiny with paper thin skin and bruises up his arms. He tried to remember where he was before this prison cell, but everything felt like a distant fog. The last place he remembered being was at home with his wife, sitting warmly by their lit fireplace and sipping tea together. He heard the sound of a distant screeching of hinges as a door opened down the hallway. The sound of footsteps came closer combined with the noise of rattling keys. Then a man stood in the hallway on the other side of the bars, by his outfit and cap it was clear he was the guard of this prison.

“Sir, please…where am I?”, the frail man asked with pitiful eyes. The guard didn’t seem amused and didn’t acknowledge the question. Instead he grabbed the ring of keys from his waist and raised it to unlock the door of the cell and open it. He stood at the open cell door and didn’t speak a word. The old man got up and walked slowly toward the opening and asked again, “Can you please tell me where I am?”. This time the guard reacted, but not with an answer, instead he grabbed the old man by the arm and lead him through the door, “Don’t play games with me Albert, we’ve been through all this before.” 

The guard put handcuffs on Albert, then pushed him ahead in front of him and told him to walk. Albert wasn’t wearing any shoes and felt the coolness of the stones beneath his feet as he walked toward the door at the end of the hall, passing a few empty cells along the way. The chill in the air made him feel even more alone than he was. “Where is my wife? Where is Ruth?”, he asked with a concern in his voice. The guard gave him an answer this time, an answer that would send a shiver down Albert’s spine, “You murdered her, you old dirty bastard.”

Albert was shocked to hear this disgusting news. He felt his heart tear in two and his stomach collapse in on itself. Tears began to stream down his face and he stopped moving forward, collapsing to the ground to weep into his frail hands. He couldn’t fathom himself committing such an act. He couldn’t understand any situation that would drive him to harm his lovely Ruth. The door at the end of the hall opened and another guard walked through and knelt beside Albert. The guard placed his hand under Albert’s right arm and pulled him up to his feet, where the other guard stood on his left side and held him by that arm. They continued to walk the weeping old man down the hall and through the doorway.

They were now in a new hallway that was dimly lit and when the door closed behind them, Albert noticed it was completely silent except for the noise they made as they walked. As he slowly hobbled down the hallway he noticed that there were only doors on the left side and one at the very end, but no holding cells. He continued to quietly cry to himself, when the two guards at his sides struck up a conversation. The guard on the right asked the one on the left, “How does he seem today?”.

“Same as the days before. Pretending to be confused. Acting like he didn’t kill his wife and officer Leroy. Using his last attempt to try and get out of things I suppose.”, the guard scoffed.

The right guard seemed more sympathetic towards Albert. “What if he really is confused though? What if he really doesn’t remember the things he did and thinks he is an innocent man?”

The guard on the left saw no difference whether or not Albert had any recollection of his actions that got him here. “He is not an innocent man. He has to pay for the crimes he committed. He was sentenced to death for his grisly murders, and that’s what will happen.”

“But, this isn’t the same man that killed his wife. This is clearly a man that remembers her alive and well. He must have not been in the right mental state when he did those awful things. I feel like we are punishing someone that is no longer morally responsible for what he has done. I don’t feel right about this.” 

They reached the end of the hall and opened the final door to a mostly empty room except for the presence of a man and a wooden chair with metal braces and straps. Albert was lead to the chair and sat down in it without hesitation, only the thoughts of his wife going through his head. The guards on both sides started to strap him in and lock the braces on his wrists; he could not move. He then began to think of his daughter and how she felt about him now. He was crushed at the thought of her having to hear that her mother was dead and it was her fathers fault. He was hoping that maybe by some miracle she was saved from the news of it all and could continue to go on happily in life. The man that was in the room before they entered stepped forward towards Albert with a metal bucket in his gloved hand. He reached into the bucket and withdrew a wet yellow sponge that was drenched with water. He then raised his arm and placed the sponge gently on Albert’s head, then proceeded to pull down a large metal crown and fastened it tightly around his cranium. As this man stepped away to the side of the room, Albert noticed a large window that was on the wall hidden behind the man with the bucket. He saw his own reflection faintly in the glass. He didn’t recognize this person sitting in the chair. He knew it was himself that he was seeing, but couldn’t understand how he became this elderly man with a long scraggly beard. He then looked through the glass and noticed a small group of people that he did not know. All of them were strangers to him, all of them except for one person that was sitting at the front of the group right in the center. He knew her very well.

“Ruth!! Ruth, my dear, why are you crying?”. The young woman in front of him was wearing a blue dress and wiping away tears with a handkerchief. Albert wanted nothing more than to break away from his restraints and comfort his wife on the other side of that window. She looked so young and beautiful, reminding him of how much he truly loved her. He couldn’t hear any noises coming through the glass, but he could see that Ruth was speaking to him as she cried. He struggled to read her lips. He couldn’t tell clearly, but it looked as though her mouth was saying, “Why, Daddy, why?”. She then covered her eyes and walked away from the window. Albert followed her with his eyes to the length of the window, which lead him to see the man with the sponge now standing at some type of switch on the wall. Why was there a switch on the wall? Suddenly, nothing felt familiar anymore.

The old man was strapped in a chair, more confused than he had ever been. There was a window in front of him with people he had never seen before. There was a man standing at a mysterious switch attached to the wall. He could not move his head, but he saw in his peripheral vision what appeared to be two guards or police officers in the room. He tried to remember how he got here, but the last thing he could remember was being at home with his wife, Ruth, drinking tea next to their fireplace. 

“Where am I?”
