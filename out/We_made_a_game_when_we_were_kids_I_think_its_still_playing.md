There were three of us.

Me, Nelson, and M.

We grew up in a small town in the middle of nowhere Arkansas — the kind where nothing changes and everyone knows your name. There wasn’t much to do, especially in the summer, so we got good at inventing our own fun. Exploring abandoned buildings. Playing flashlight tag. Daring each other to break into old trailers or hike deep into the woods just to prove we weren’t scared.

But nothing stuck with us like The Game.

We made it up when we were nine. Nelson had found a weird old notebook in his attic — probably just something his older brother left behind — filled with strange little rules written in smudged pencil.

“Once you start The Game, you must finish it.”
“You must play in threes.”
“One will lie, one will forget, one will remember.”

It felt like a prank, or something made up by a bored teenager trying to freak out little kids.

But we were little kids. And we wanted to be freaked out.

So we played.

⸻

The rules were simple — or at least, they seemed simple at the time.

We had to choose one abandoned place in town. That would be the “anchor.” Then each of us had to bring an item that meant something personal: a photo, a toy, a drawing, whatever. We placed the items in a triangle around the anchor point, and then we each sat in the middle and told a secret.

After that, we weren’t allowed to talk about what happened during the game. Not ever. Not even to each other.

We picked the old VHS rental store on the edge of town. It had been closed for years, windows all boarded up except for one shattered pane in the back. The carpet was still stained with soda spills, and the shelves were all half-empty, covered in dust.

M brought a little wooden bird her grandfather had carved her.
Nelson brought a ripped picture of his family.
I brought my dad’s badge from the volunteer fire department.

We placed them in the triangle. Sat down. Told our secrets.

I don’t even remember what mine was anymore.

That’s what’s been bothering me the most lately.

Because I remember everything else.

⸻

We went home that night like nothing happened.

For a while, nothing did.

We grew up. Drifted in and out of each other’s lives. Still stayed close, but not like before. M got quieter. Nelson got darker. I took a night job at the jail, started living life in reverse.

Then a few weeks ago, I started getting these texts.

From a number I didn’t recognize.

No words — just photos.

A picture of the old VHS store. Still boarded up, but somehow… different.

A picture of a triangle burned into dirt. Three items. One of them was my dad’s badge.

And then one that chilled me to the bone:
Me.
Sleeping.
In my own bed.

⸻

I called Nelson.

He didn’t pick up.

But M did.

She was crying. Said Nelson had shown up at her place two days ago in the middle of the night — wild-eyed, mumbling something about The Game never ending, how it was “waking up again.” He tried to get her to pack a bag and leave town.

She thought he was having some kind of breakdown.

She made him tea.

He left.

That was the last she saw of him.

⸻

I found Nelson the next day.

He was sitting on the roof of the old VHS store.

Barefoot. Shirtless. Shivering, even though it was 82 degrees.

He didn’t look at me when I climbed up. Just whispered:

“You’re the one who forgot, Jay. You were always the one who was supposed to forget.”

I asked what he was talking about.

He finally turned and looked me in the eye — but it wasn’t him looking back.

It was panic, wearing his face.

“It doesn’t end when the game’s over,” he said.
“It ends when one of us stops playing.”

Then he stepped off the roof.

⸻

He survived.

Broken spine. Concussion. A dozen fractures.

He hasn’t said a word since.

⸻

M won’t return my calls now.

I drove by her house last night — her car was there, lights were on, but no one answered the door.

There was a triangle scratched into the wood of her porch.

Three items at each point.

A wooden bird.

A ripped photo.

And a third object I couldn’t quite make out —
until I got closer.

My knife.

From my locker at work. I didn’t even know it was missing.

⸻

I don’t know what this is.
A curse? A ritual? Just some twisted psychological experiment we stumbled into?

All I know is — I’m remembering more now. Little flashes. Like dreams you suddenly realize were real.

In the game, I told a secret.

A real one. One I haven’t thought about in years.

And now I keep dreaming of the VHS store. In the dark. The shelves full of blank tapes. And a figure behind the counter, wearing Nelson’s face. Smiling like he knows something I don’t.

⸻

I think the game is choosing again.

And I don’t think it ends with us.

Because last night…
I woke up to a knock at my door.

No one was there.

Just a box.

Inside?

Three things.

A photograph of M.
Nelson’s broken wristwatch.
And a sticky note that said:

“Your turn to forget.”

⸻

If anyone knows what this is —
how to finish a game you didn’t know you were still playing —

Please tell me.

Before I remember the secret I swore I’d never speak.

And before it remembers me.
