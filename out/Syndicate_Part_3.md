“Live”



The word rang in my head for a while. She wasn’t giving me a righteous speech or trying to rise up as a hero. She just spoke truthfully. The truth was that there nothing I could do except just live. *Breathe, eat, shit, repeat*. Surprisingly, that helped ease me out of my panic attack. The fears I had about my family were pushed down into the pit of my mind. There was nothing I could do here. Somehow that hopelessness kept me sane. 



A few hours after my attack, I sat with her while she tinkered around with a plastic water bottle. 



“I’m Crystal.” I said with the same inflection Noah had earlier. 



“Sandy.” she replied, glancing up at me. “Short for Sandra.”



We sat in silence for a while. I was still too new and too nervous to dive into questions about what was happening or why we were here. Noah walked around for a while, cleaning up his “station” (as he called it). Finally, I felt the sharp pain in my bladder. I wondered for a moment where I had *gone* previously, knowing that I couldn’t have held it for a day. I was in such a daze; I hadn’t processed my own bodily functions. 



“Where do we go?” I asked vaguely 



Noah was quick to respond “Nowhere until they tell us” 



Sandy sighed, “Show her the bucket.” She told Noah. “Don’t worry about the blankets. They’re gone now.” That answered my previous question… At that point I still had enough decency to feel embarrassed about what my “roommates” thought of me. 



Noah walked me to a corner of the room with a shower curtain. He opened the curtain and I saw what could be considered a tub, and inside was a makeshift toilet. I had seen something like this years ago while camping– it was essentially a bucket with a toilet seat. However, it looked like there was an actual hole for a drain. I wondered why anyone would put so much effort into replicating something of a decent restroom until the pain hit me again. 



“Thanks. Excuse me.” Noah stepped back as I closed the curtains. 



After I finished and stepped out, I started examining the entirety of the space. If I hadn't noticed the "bathroom", I wondered if there were other aspects of the room that gotten past me.



I mapped the layout of the room. The room was a near perfect rectangle. If you were to imagine it, picture a rectangle with the left and right sides being the longest sides; the shorter sides could be considered the front and back. There were 2 doors mirroring each other on either side. The door on the right led to the outside, while the other must have led to the inside of a home. When I crouched down by the left-side door, I could feel cool air pushing past the threshold. We took walls as our stations; Sandra and I shared the wall with the interior door. Noah took the wall opposite of us to give us space. It was hard to believe that despite being stripped of so much, we still gave each other the dignity of privacy. 



The interior door didn’t have windows, but something like a mail-slot, only wider. Whoever took us would deliver our meals and water this way. Surprisingly they fed us 3 square meals and our daily need of water. We were never starved or dehydrated. Looking back, I think it was to keep us stronger for longer. 



After a few days, I began to feel dirty. I could feel the oil build up in my hair, and it tie itself into a curly, tangled mess. My outside was now matching my inside: a dirty, tangled mess. I began to fantasize that I was lying in a tub, letting myself float down to the bottom, weightless… watching as the ripples of water above me spread out of view. The bubbles of air escaping my lungs like stars. I laid flat on the floor and felt the cool sting of water at my fingertips. I could smell the sweet smell of soap as I watched the filth float away from me. 



I was disassociating again. The feeling of fear leaving me gave me a sense of relief. Reality began to intertwine with my delusions. 



I heard Sandra mutter “come back” or something like it. I sat up slowly as if I had been heavy from the weight of the imaginary water. 



“Don’t let it take you.” She said, “stay focused. If not for yourself than for us. I know this sucks but be here with us.” 



I stared at her blankly. My mind was half gone, but I fought through the fog and focused on her.



“I’m familiar with mental illness." She started, "My mother and sister.” She continued, “My mother was borderline, and my sister is bipolar. I know it’s hard, but just stay here.” she said pointing at her head.



I sat like a child on the floor looking at my hands before I spoke, “I hated losing myself. I'd stop caring, and good moms care. I just want to be a good mom." I looked around the room thinking about what I had just said. 



Sandra snapped, “Don’t worry about being a good mom, worry about us. If you spiral, we have to deal with it. We didn’t do anything to you, they did.” she pointed at the door. “They are the bad guys. We are the closest thing you have to family now.” 



I stared at her, unable to speak. I laid back down and stared at the ceiling forcing myself to stay present despite the tears stinging my eyes. 



“Why are we here?” I finally asked. I heard an exacerbated sigh come from Noah across from us. 



“We don’t know,” Sandra stated. I looked over at her while she leaned back on her bed and over at Noah who was shaking his head slowly in disagreement. 



“What?” I asked whoever would humor me. 



Sandra shifted, “Noah has his conspiracy theories.” 



“It’s better than nothing,” he said plainly. I sat up. 



“What do you think?” I asked. Noah sat up on his elbows, as if he had been through this time and time before. 



“I think,” he began, “it’s just a fear tactic. I think that whoever did this wants to spread fear… or I don't know… cause chaos.”



Sandy snorted, “like the Joker or something.”



“No.” Noah snapped, “I’m being serious. Think about over the years all the people that have gone missing. they were all different… whatever. What if those kidnappings were inspiration for something bigger?” 



“I don’t know.” I said in disagreement, “people *have* been taken or trafficked by awful people. I don’t think it was all staged.” I argued.



Noah sighed with aggravation, “No, I know *that.* That's not what I’m saying. I’m not saying *those* were staged. What I’m getting at…” he took a deep breath, “What if the people that took *us* used *those* kidnappings to cover *their* tracks." He gestured and Sandra and me, "Look at us, we aren’t the same gender, the same race, or even the same age. We aren’t even from the same area. But each of us might fit with an MO of another serial whatever…” Noah sat back and rested his head on the wall. I could tell he was done with the conversation. I stared at him, and at that moment I believed him. 



“Maybe.” I began, “but what do they want from us? Nothing has happened to us.”



“Yet,” Noah laid back down, and I felt myself falling down his rabbit hole.
