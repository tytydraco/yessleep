I remember this story like it was yesterday. It was the summer of 2019, it was evening, I was sitting on a terrace in front of the building I ate sunflower seeds with the boys, but I finished them all 

The boys asked me to go and get them, they also gave me 20 lei to go, I had accepted but later regretted it, you see, I live between neighborhoods Ferentari and Rahova Two neighborhoods in Bucharest known throughout Romania as dangerous neighborhoods I had to go to a Profi 6 km from me On the way I had seen a man of about 30 years old dressed in a surgeon's suit on a street leading to a field He had waved at me. Ignoring him, I continued on my way, after I came I saw him with another man who was on an operating bed, they also had a short conversation

The conversation:

Surgeon: Are you ready for me to take your kidney Mr. Iordache?

Man: I think so

The surgeon: well, I'm going to anesthetize you with this syringe, but I'm telling you, you might not wake up 

Man: I will do anything to help my family but?

The surgeon: but what?

Man: who is he?
*The man is pointing his finger at me*

The man greeted me with a disturbingly murderous smile I ran away, I told the boys that I couldn't stay, they understood me and said that we will eat the seeds tomorrow After I had reached the gate of my house with the trees next to it rubbing against the bars where they hold the vines, I entered the house and locked the gate and the door 

What crossed my mind was to call the police and report it 

The conversation between me and the operator:

Operator: 112 what is your problem?

Me: I want to report an organ theft 

Operator: where do you live

Me: between neighborhoods Ferentari and Rahova

Operator: and where it all happened

Me: It happened on (Street omitted)

Operator: ok sir we will send the patrols there

When the police arrived at the scene, everything they saw marked them for life A dirty operating bed two gloves soaked in blood a scalpel on the ground and in a ditch on the way out to the field Next to a willow tree he found the operated man Their faces were frozen with fear and their abdomens were open, exposing their liver, pancreas, prostate, stomach, intestines and a visible kidney After the incident, the whole neighborhood heard I was called a hero, but I wasn't proud I was not a narcissist

Nightly patrols were created for safety Back at the terrace all the boys praised me for realizing a great danger Although one of them asks me if he will return I tell him I don't know for sure When I returned home I went to bed at 2 in the morning suddenly I received a WhatsApp message from an unknown number 
*Why else defendant?*
*not nice you just don't want to be a bad boy do you?*

After I read them, I said in my mind: Oh my God, this man is head over heels 

After that, nothing happened until today, there was no report of the presence of the man they said had gone to Mexico 

Although it has not come again, I know that one day it will return and it will not be good at all
