I have a good life. I have never felt hunger. I've never lacked warmth. Yet, sadness and exhaustion has haunted me since I was a child. 

I remember being a young girl watching other kids play wondering what the point was. I watched as my sister would swing on the monkey bars with ease. This looked exhausting. 

As an adult, I struggle with the demands and repetition of adulthood. Logically I understand the point of having a job. You have to do something to gain something. But some part of me feels like it's meaningless. As of it is not what we are meant to be doing.

I struggle with owning things. I feel heavy. A car, a house, clothes, chairs, tables. And the toys... I keep our house to minimum and yet I feel overloaded.


I spent my twenties drunk as drunk could be, running from the sadness. Trying to feel the exhilaration of life that so many others seem to have. But I could only run so far before I got dizzy and hit the floor.

I attended concerts and while everyone around me laughed and had a great time, I found myself hiding in the corners. My best friend would come out looking refreshed and full of life and I.... I wanted to climb into the deepest cave I could find and sleep.

I am now approaching forty, I am sober and I have two amazing children under six. They are delightful well behaved children. I truly enjoy their company. We live on the side of a mountain on several acres. Money is tight, but not so that we lack. I should be happy. I should want for not.

I have hobbies so my children are not my end all be all. I whittle, tinker with jewelry making, read. We spend most of our days outside in nature. During those moments, I am at ease and happy. As night approaches I begin to feel hollow. I begin to feel lost. I eat well and sleep many hours and yet I am exhausted the moment I open my eyes. Something in my mind says I'm looking for the missing piece of me.

I look to the stars and I can see worlds far from us. Galaxies filled with life. I feel my heart being pulled to far away places. I gaze across the ocean and witness the earth moving through time and space. When deep in thought, there's a door I see. When I begin to crack it open, answers from the unknown are in my reach. As I step forward, I am thrown out and the door slams shut again.

I don't believe in God, at least not in the ways of organized religions. But I do pray, and believe my prayers have been answered. But by who or what?
Why do I look into the mirror and see only a part of who I am? Where did the rest of me go? Or did I leave myself behind in another life?

I'm not looking for answers in this forum. I just needed to "say" it out loud to someone else. Thanks for reading.
