I’ve always wondered about it. Where I came from. Who I came from. What he was like. What his name was. But every time I brought him up in conversation, my mother would get upset. 

The older I grew, the more upset she became when I asked, so I stopped altogether. I gave in to the fact I would never know. 

The truly sad thing was, she was a very active sleepwalker, and had been her whole life. She’d woken up in other people’s homes. In people’s cars. Even in a 24 hour drug store. 

It was a thought I never wanted to entertain. But the possibility my mother sleepwalked into the wrong place and been taken advantage of, was always hiding in the back of my mind.

Then my mother passed away. 

As I was cleaning out her house, I came across a dozen small boxes under her bed. They were filled with notebooks. 

The front covers of the notebooks had detailed dates spanning six month intervals. They started fifty years ago and went up until thirty years ago. There hadn’t been anything since. 

Other than the dates, there was no writing on the covers. 

Curiosity got me, so I found the first notebook and read the first entry.  

It was a sleep diary, written by my mother in a tone I’d never heard before. 

She was in love. My whole life, my mother steered clear of men. I’d never known her to have one, single boyfriend. 

But in the sleep diary, she was in love with a man. My mother never spoke his name, she only referred to the man as “My love.” 

The first entry spoke of him coming to her in a dream. He spoke in a warm voice, through the cold darkness and haze of my mother’s clouded mind. 

The man guided my mother into a bright opening that led into a clearing. 

There, she met the man she referred to only as “My love.”

My mother couldn’t physically describe him, other than unimaginable beauty and grace and charm. The man emitted something from every part of his being that “sent electric bolts through my mother’s body.” 

I skimmed through the diaries and read what turned into a full blown love story between my mother and this literal man of her dreams. 

One of the strange things was, it wasn’t even sexual. There was just this connection they had that created a fullness in her soul my mother had been missing her whole life. 

She wrote about the two of them spending hours, days even years in some utopian paradise. The landscapes were filled with waterfalls and streams and rolling hills and mountains and a warm sunlight always shining down. 

The two would read and eat and drink and swim and experience things she couldn’t begin to explain involving vast, evolving vistas and horizons.

Reading it made me feel happy for my mother. Even if it was just all a dream, she really seemed to have found love. And in some kind of way that she couldn’t find in real life. 

I didn’t read all the notebooks, but I wanted to know how my mother’s story ended. So I skipped to the last diary, and found the last entry. 

Their relationship had changed. They were no longer spending their days in a fantastic valley together. 

The man had been leading my mother into a strange hole in the Earth that spiralled downward in a walking tunnel. My mother’s hand was always held tightly in the man’s. But she would never try to pull away.  

She’d hated going into the hole because they would walk for what seemed like hours. Continuing to spiral downwards and becoming dizzier and dizzier. 

But she kept going deeper and they went further underground. 

Frightening, glowing spectres began to move past her. She grabbed ahold of the man, but she didn’t feel his grip back. 

The walls of the tunnels moved, shifting around like a living organism. And the ground under her feet became hot. Unbearably hot.

Finally, the tunnel reached an opening. 

There was land for miles covered in thick layers of roaring flames. 

The man held my mother close, then threw her into the fire. 

She described the immediate burning as being impossibly painful. A moment later, the man jumped in on top of her. But he was no longer a man. 

He had horrific, red melting flesh. And he burned worse than the flames under my mother. 

I stopped reading as he began to ravage her. I couldn’t bring myself to read about my mother’s rape. Even if it was in a dream. 

Even if… somehow… it related to my conception. 

Because that was the other thing… the last entry date was nine months to the day of my birth.
