Silence. No noices but the engine. I was driving exactly what the sign allowed me to drive. I had turned off the music some minutes ago. Maybe that's quarter an hour ago. I took a short look to the side. My mother seemed to be sleeping in the co-driver's seat. So I looked back at the road in front of the car. I enjoyed it. I felt inner peace. Another car appeared at the horizon. I turned off the high beam untill we passed each other. I took a short look in the rear mirror as the backlights disappeared. I looked back on the road again and suddenly the car's light hit something right in front of me. Too shocked to scream I hit the break. The tires squeaked. I heard a dull noice as something dark hit the front. I saw it rolling up the windshield and disappearing at the top of the car. 

Standing on the street I couldn't think anything for a second. My mother asked me something, but I couldn't hear her. 

"Excuse me, what did you say?" I finally replied after a few seconds. 

"What happened?" she repeated. Of course, she was sleeping as it happened, so what should I tell her? 

"Hehehe!" A deep voice laughed at the back of the car. This explained everything to me. 

"Nothing. Just a wyld animal. I think I didn't hit it." 

"Are you sure? I mean-" 

I interrupted her by saying "Yes, Ma, I am sure. I just need a short break." 

"Funny." This came from behind again. 

"Fuck you!" I shout in my mind. 

"Ma, are you ok?" I thought maybe the seatbelt could've caused a bruise. 

"How about yourself?" came from the backseats. 

"Shut up. You know that I don't care about me." I replied mentally. 

"I'm allright." She said. "Do you want me to continue driving?" 

"No, I can do this. Please try to get some more sleep. You didn't get much of it in recent days." 

So we continued driving. Some minutes later, I don't know how much exactly, I started a conversation but not with my mother. 

"What the fuck was that?!" 

"It was funny." was the answer from behind. "But you didn't laugh. Hehehe!" 

I said nothing. I just looked angry in the rear mirror. Right into his eyes. I will never forget his bright white eyes. Sometimes they are red, but usually they are white. White eyes in a body that has no colour but black. To be honest, I don't know how his body is formed, I never saw it clearly enough. But obviously there has to be enough space for him in the backseats. 

"Do you want me to appear outside again? Hahaha!" 

"Fuck you" was all I could answer. 

"So you like it better if I stay right here?" Now I no longer heard him from behind but as usual in my head. A short look in the mirror showed me that he was no longer in the back of the car. 

"Yeah, kinda. At least here you can't cause any shit like that." 

"Oh, are you sure, little boy?" 

"What do you mean?" 

"What about: Take a look at the street, idiot!" He raised his voice for the last sentence. 

My concentration changed from the conversation back to the street. This time the lights showed something brown... Something like a wooden stick... A big wooden stick. Where did that came from? 

Somehow I wasn't able to turn around. The last thing I remember is that I heard his laughing. A last time.
