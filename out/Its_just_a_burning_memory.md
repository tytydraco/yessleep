I hate my job. I work the night shift in a data entry position at a struggling division of a firm that's desperate to stay afloat. It's boring, repetitive and mentally taxing. Our small team handles grunt work while everything important happens during the day. Most nights, I feel like a nocturnal animal, clawing away at my keyboard, pouring my sanity for something that's less than mediocre. The survey papers stack in hundreds, and its my job to fit them into spreadsheets.

Time hasn't been really kind to me lately. I rarely catch any actual sleep during the day, and it's jarring for me to keep going through. My job pays well above my expectations, and the leads really don't care for the hours since its a new project and they want results as soon as possible, which requires I compile the data. I've been at it for months now, and I really want a release. I can't build up the courage to quit because I fear I won't be compensated so well anywhere else.

My shift runs 9 PM to 5:30 AM, though it always feel longer. To keep myself sane, I usually put on a playlist as I type away. It's the same mix every night, songs I know by heart. Everything I do feels stale lately and I decided to try something new tonight, or wait - maybe it was last night. Anyways. I was late into my shift. I had switched to a random radio mix on my streaming app, hoping to add some flavour to this drudgery. It was around 3:37 AM when it met me. The title of the song caught my eye, "It's just a burning memory", the artist listed as "The Caretaker".

It wasn’t like anything I had ever heard before. A constant melody looped endlessly, as though trapped in a forgotten era. It was soft, distant, but insistent—a waltz that seemed to float just beyond reach, constantly repeating itself in a way that felt wrong, like a memory you could never quite recall. The gentle melody was dissonant, warped in a static hiss that cracked and popped like an old radio struggling to get in range. It slipped through the cracks of my brain, and left behind only a faint echo. The more I listened, the more it felt as though it sunk deeper into my mind, a reflection on an alternate life where I had died.

I already had a sharp pain at the back of my head that night, and I couldn't really appreciate what I heard. Maybe something avant-garde, but it just didn't fit my taste. The song stretched for four  minutes that felt like an hour, and that's when I noticed something. The duration was off, just the blank "--:--" staring at me, where I'd usually see a timestamp. I glanced at the system clock, 3:37 AM. It had been so for quite a while. Minutes passed, five, ten... it remained indifferent, and the song looped endlessly.

I yanked off my earphones and shut the music off, a hum still buzzing faintly in my ears. I needed to clear my head. My hands shook as I put the system to sleep, saving my work. I felt my ears wet and bleed, and the pain gnaw at the back of my skull. The vending machine by the elevator lobby was my usual escape. The floor was deserted, but that was my typical night shift; or at least.. it should have been. The machine hissed as it dispensed a foam cup of warm coffee. I took it with trembling hands, hoping it'd erase my headache. It did provide comfort as it touched my dry lips. The bitterness took to my tongue, and as I turned back towards my desk, I froze.

The floor looked different.

The corridor should have led directly to my workstation, but now it stretched impossibly far, the fluorescent lights flickering to the distance. The walls were rather further apart, and the space yawned in unnatural proportions. I took another slow slip of coffee, but soon hurdled it down my throat as I began to panic. I threw the cup into the bin. The thud sounded an echo in the silence of buzzing lights and the low tread of my footsteps on the carpet.

I took to the large glass window by the lobby. The city outside was cloaked in thick fog that swallowed everything in sight. Only the streetlamps pierced the haze and their glow was pale and sickly, casting long shadows on the empty streets. No cars. No people. Nothing moved. 

The buildings stood still, their windows lit but lifeless. My heart pounded as I turned away from the sight. I needed clarity, or at least someone to reassure me.

Adi, the system admin, was usually in the server room at this hour, running important backups. I came upon my co-worker Marsh's desk as I hurried, only to see it unnaturally placed. His chair was pushed back and his system was down with a blank, blue screen. There was no sign of him, but his chair was warm to the touch. It was as if he left with everything in its place.

I pressed on to the server room. The corridor that led there felt longer than I remembered, the air still and cold. I peered into the room, pushing the door gently inwards. I made myself halfway in, searching the room. I saw rows of humming computers extending endlessly. "Adi?" I called, but my voice vanished into the hum. Nothing. 

In the distance, as my vision focused, I could see, under a flickering tube-light hanging erratically between the boxed computers - a figure tied to a chair. Thick, strong wiring wrapped around its neck, the body hanging limply as if the life had been drained from it. The shirt was torn open, exposing bare, mangled skin, bloodied and raw. In place of a mouth was a gaping, hollow, rubber-like hole yawned wide - toothless. Its sockets were empty, face was frozen in a harrowing expression, a twisted mask of terror and pain - like it had screamed in its final moments, but the scream had never been released. 

The acrid stench of rotting flesh slowly met my nostrils, suffocating. A sudden metallic clang ran from one corner of the large room, a loud shriek aching my pained ears. It was very human, very discordant, as if a tormented metal throat screamed in pain. My heart thundered through my chest, as I had never witnessed an image so grotesque, so utterly wrong in all my life. But soon, as the shriek grew, the chair jolted toward me at an unnatural speed. The figure shook like it had a seizure and finally crashed upon the door.

I could see its face hit the square window etched into the door. 

I backed out immediately as it began to bang itself on the door, each thud growing louder. I knew I had to leave, and get out of the building- ASAP. The elevator. 

I reached the elevator and smashed the button for the ground floor. I caught a breath, trying to process what I saw. The elevator groaned as it descended, but the display kept ticking past G; -1, -2, -3... I gripped the rail as it slid lower, deeper than the building should go.

It came to a sudden halt. The doors opened with a groan, revealing a parking lot bathed in pale, artificial light. I do not remember the building having basements at all. It had at its lowest, just the ground floor.

I stepped out cautiously. There were more cars parked than there were people in the office building.

I climbed a flat ramp to make it to the streets. The building was not the same. It wasn't our HQ. I didn't know where I was. In the distance, I could see a taxi idled under a street lamp. Its headlights bore into the thick fog. I had an uneasy feeling and felt like approaching it, but I really did not know what I was expecting. The city felt dead, or maybe I was.

I approached cautiously. I could make out the silhouette of driver sat inside through the windshield. He was an older man in a slick, worn jacket. His cold eyes stared blankly into the distance, face pale. His expression was very static, almost unnatural - like a doll. I knocked gently on the window, and his head snapped towards me, the motion too sudden and rigid. I flinched. His lips curled into smirk as one of his brows gently frowned.

He rolled down the window, and I stammered, *"Can you... take me home? Clover Apartments?".* I had tried to call my wife quite a few times, but the line was dead. *"Do you know if there's a signal here? My phone's not-"* 

He interrupted, *"Payphone. Just across the corner."*, his head nudging to the side as his gaze locked upon me.

I hesitantly nodded, and searched my pockets for a dime. My pulse quickened as I slid it into the slot, waiting anxiously for the line to connect as I dialled home. It stood beneath a flickering light, the rusted frame barely holding it together. 

As the line clicked and I heard static, I began - *"Anna, dear.. something's wrong. Are you okay? I'm on my way --",* and was abruptly cut.

*"Come home, Joe. We miss you. It's been too long."*, her soft voice spoke.

The line went dead.

I stood perplexed. Something about how she talked wasn't right. Her voice felt alien and hollow, and I swear I heard a deep voice beneath hers rumbling faintly, like a second voice layered beneath. Why did she talk that way? What was she talking about? I still have no clue. 

I turned, startled to find that the taxi had moved - unnaturally, sliding closer behind me while I was on the phone. The driver's grin grew wider, and too wide.. teeth flashing as his excited eyes ate into mine. Everything about him was very off. *"Let's get you home, son."* he said, tone disturbingly pleasant but hollow. My legs felt weak as I walked to the passengers seat. I had to get home. I was lost. I felt I could trust him, but that was naive of me. His head turned to follow me, the movement jerky and unnatural. I slid into the seat, feeling his eyes on me the entire time.

*"Perfect,"* he murmured as I shut the door, starting the ignition.

As we moved through the foggy streets, the driver's cold eyes never left me in the rear view mirror. I felt really uneasy. The journey felt like hours, and I really couldn't recognize any of the streets we were on. Not until we reached my block.

The taxi dropped me off by the entrance of my apartment complex.

As I stepped out of the taxi to grab some cash from my wallet, he interrupted, *"Don't bother."* I couldn't place why he didn't ask for any money. 

As he began to drive off, he remarked, ***"You don't belong here."*** and faded into the distant fog. 

I couldn't make anything of what he meant to say. Standing there, as confused as I was, I broke off from the thoughts that raced my head. 

I slowly entered the complex. The reception was empty. *The power was out.* I took the steps to the second floor through the stairwell, and made it to my apartment, feeling my way and working my memory in the darkness. The door was left open. *Interesting.*

There was no point in trying for the lights. The entire building was plunged in darkness. The air was eerily still, and I couldn't even hear any faint signs of life on the floor. 

I called for Anna as I tread in. She just wasn't there. I knew it. The apartment was empty, but a musky, deathly scent caught my nostrils. It was cold too, and I really couldn't help but feel ill. As I went inside, I felt something watched me. My head had felt stiff for the past few minutes, but the pain had subsided. Of course, I felt lighter, but everything I was experiencing was just out of place and something I really could not fathom as I write this.

I recall going to the bathroom to splash some cold water on my face, trying to freshen up. I stared at my reflection in the mirror, and my face began to distort around the edges. I knew my brain was playing tricks on me. I shut the tap, and it was just then.. as I remember, I heard faint, distant laughter break the uneasy silence. *It was coming from the living room,* through where I had just entered. I could hear the TV talk in some foreign language I had never heard. 

I slowly walked toward the living room, my breath coming shallow.

And then I saw him.

Mr. Anderson, sitting on the couch, his eyes glued to the TV, chuckling at something on the screen. That couldn't be right. **Mr. Anderson had died months ago.** 

*"Mr. Anderson?"* my voice trembled.

He smiled as he turned to me, *"Joe! Check out this new show I found. It's hilarious!"* He chuckled, the dim light from the TV screen shining on his glasses.

The show was bizarre. A warped sitcom that kept glitching. The laughter was too loud, unnervingly high pitched, like a laugh track on a loop. The characters' faces were obscured in odd static bursts, and the background kept shifting - as though they kept changing the set again and again. From a mall, to a kitchen to a morgue. The people in the show wore uncanny skin masks, and something was very wrong about the unmatching outfits and discordant voices.

Mr. Anderson often came home early weekend evenings to have a chat or a cup of his favourite lemon tea. Him being here, now, at this hour, and long dead, made me cripple. I shook, *"Mr. Anderson, you've been.. you've been dead for months. You - you can't be here. I remember.. attending your funeral.."* And trust me when I say that. He had no family of his own, never married. Anna and I were probably the only people other than his brother that knew him best.

*"Dead? What are you talking about, Joe? I'm right here."* he chuckled, tapping the side of his temple, *"You know, some people can't just handle a good laugh."* Everything I remember about him was so close to this apparition I was witnessing. I knew I was hallucinating. He leaned back, completely at ease, and switched the TV off. *"Anyways, Anna's out at the pharmacy down the block. She went to get some melatonin. She's been disturbed lately, poor thing."* he paused. *"She forgot to lock the door again, and that's why I'm here. Watching over."*

Disturbed? She never said a thing to me about being disturbed. What was going on? And how did Mr. Anderson, *or whoever this was*, know? **Why could I see him?**

*"I won't bother you much Joe. I think you need some rest."* he rose, dusting himself off. *"I'll be back tomorrow, now that you're here. Just wanted to check in on you, son."* As he left, he smiled and remarked, an uncanny shine in his eyes, *"And... take care of Anna."* he walked out in stiff, unusual movements, his footsteps fading down the hallway. 

I choked up. I still couldn't understand what was happening. I recall stumbling through the apartment, trying to make sense of it all. I found my way to a room where pictures from my past hung on walls as a memorial to the time that flew by. Pictures, from my wedding day, my childhood, and memories now I only wish I could recreate. It stung when I realized that the life I lived was not the one I had imagined for myself.

**This was the room we'd planned for a child, but never had. Never could.** 

It felt wrong, like I shouldn't be here. Anna was always so sensitive about this space. I sat down on the small bed, head in my hands.. trying to get over my thoughts. I stared at the photos pinned to the walls. The wedding photo. Anna's expression seemed forced, too rigid. And my smile? Hollow. *I couldn't remember the moment as it was captured.*

I glanced at a gallery on the wall, pictures from my childhood. I saw my parents. Together on days they'd spend just for me, and act like we were a happy family. I had cherished those memories, until now.

Something was off.

I noticed, on every photograph, the younger me, was missing. I wasn't there. Just my parents. In fact, they embraced themselves. Like a loving couple. None of these could pass my memory. What was going on? 

Just then, I saw a child stand by the doorframe, fidgeting curiously with a familiar toy from my childhood in his hands. My favourite, a wooden toy plane - the one I used to carry everywhere.. dressed in overalls I often wore as a child.

And then I realized. 

**It was the younger me.** 

The curious child, barely seven, walked up to me. "Do you wike my twoy?" he asked innocently. I trembled as I replied, "I do." my throat tight. The boy smiled, nodding as he closed in, flying his plane, "Cawptain joe.. cawptain.. take to the sky!" he giggled. I began to break into tears as I asked, "Where ... are your parents?", and the boy said, "Dunno", shrugging, unbothered.

My heart ached, and suddenly, memories from my childhood began to flood my mind. The loneliness, the neglect. The way I never felt at home. I couldn't hold it in anymore. Tears welled up in my eyes, and I reached out, pulling the child into an embrace.

I cried for the childhood I never had. For the warmth, that I never felt. "I'm sorry... I'm so, so sorry.", I choked.

But as I held him, the boy's body grew unnaturally cold. His skin was too smooth, too pale. The warmth faded away until it felt like I held a figure of warm wax. He fell silent. The toy slipped from his hands and hit the floor with a soft clink. I pulled away, horrified. The boy's eyes were pitch black, body slugging in my arms. Before I could react, he limped and down he collapsed to the floor with a sickening thud. 

I stared in shock as ants began to swarm his lifeless form, spilling in from unseen cracks, heaping over the body like a tide of foragers. They writhed over him, eating away his skin. My stomach churned. They crawled into his mouth, ears, eyes - consuming his body.

I shrieked, my pulse racing, stumbling toward the door. The boy was still, motionless - the ants heaping over him. I crawled backwards, and shut the door behind me hurriedly.

I slouched against the cold wall, my head hung low and tired, chest heaving. Exhaustion took over as I slipped into a restless slumber, my eyes tired and burning. 

I wake up disoriented - my eyes heavy, head pounding. Everything felt hazy, distant. I blinked a few times and my surroundings came into focus. 

I see Anna lying in bed, her breath soft and even. Relief flooded me, and I sprung to my knees, limping in a rush towards the bedroom.

"Joe?!" she murmured, startled, sitting up. She switches on a lamp by our bed. Her eyes were half-open, groggy and concerned. "You're... you're here," she remarked. "You're okay!?" my sore voice cracked. "Of course, I'm okay... you're the one shaking. What's wrong?" said her voice, confused.

And honestly, I didn't know how to answer. How could I explain what I had seen? What I felt?

Seeing her here, safe and sound, made my horror feel like a distant nightmare. However, I first thought it was a wicked trick my brain played on me. 

"You're scaring me," she whimpered softly as I stared into her eyes, traumatized. "Hey... just come to bed, okay? It's been.. been a long week." she said, eyes not quite meeting mine. 

"Yeah," I whispered. "Maybe."

She sighed, "Come to bed soon," and she switched off the lamp. There I stood in the darkness.

Now it's early morning, the clock on my desk reads 6:41 AM. I stand by the window, peeking through the blinds. The city is awake, alive, breathing - or as I see it is. The distant hum of traffic and the first rays of sunlight make it feel as though everything is normal. I want to believe. 

I sit here at my study, still in my work clothes. As I share my experience, typing hastily, a notification blinks on the corner of my screen. It's Marsh.

"Hey Joe, Hope you're feeling better. You gave us quite a scare at work previously. Glad I could help you get home. Let me know if you need anything." 

My chest tightens as I read his words. He brought me home?

I don't know what's real anymore. Can't collect my thoughts well, and I'm still trying to figure out what happened. I hear the discordant waltz from the song echo in my mind, though it's hard for me to fully recall what it sounded like, but impossible to forget.

It sure has hit me somewhere into my subconscious, unearthing something buried and raw.

Maybe when I give it a second listen, I'll finally understand. Maybe it'll help me piece together whatever it has awakened in me. 

Or maybe, it'll pull me deeper into the unknown and the vivid.

As of now, It's just a burning memory.
