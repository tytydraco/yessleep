I walked into my band class on a Friday afternoon. But my Band Director, Mr. John, looked oddly optimistic. In his hand was an envelope with the presidential seal. Mr. John then opened it and started to read it.

“Dear Mr. John and the band students at Hospers High school,

We are astounded to announce you will be performing the star spangled banner at the presidential inauguration! Your performance in many competitions has made our president elect choose YOU to perform at the inauguration. It is a major event in American history and we are looking to see you here!

Sincerely, The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies”

We were excited to preform in D.C, too. Also in the envelope was a check containing the money to pay for our tickets to D.C. “This will be a major event in American history, so you guys should better not mess up the anthem!” Mr. John said. After that, he passed out copies of the star strangled banner. Then he had us warm up and we played the anthem. We were doing good for the most part, but suddenly all the clarinets squeaked on one note.

“Clarinets! Why did you squeak? It would be unacceptable if that happened while at the inauguration!” Mr. John then had them go back a few measures for them to play. But they just kept squeaking. He then had to check their reeds to make sure they worked. “Strange” he replied. It was all working well, so he figured it was just them blowing too hard. So he told them to play less hard. Then we continued.

However, suddenly all the trumpets stopped making noise. Mr. John asked why they weren’t playing. But the Trumpets said they were. So Mr. John made them play one by one, but no sound came out, not even a small buzz. So Mr. John spent a few minutes seeing what was wrong with their trumpets. But try as he might he couldn’t find anything. So he just told them to not play and practice more at home. 

We continued playing until eventually the saxes reeds broke. “HOW DID YOU BREAK YOUR REEDS?” Mr. John angrily screamed at them. “It’s not my fault!” Sam, a baritone saxophone said “It just chipped by itself!” All other saxes agreed with him. “Very funny” Mr. John said, he then passed them new reeds. “Be more gentle with it next time” Mr. John replied. After that he made us play from the beginning again. 

However, this time it was percussion. I couldn’t find my sticks for my drums, and neither did my classmates. But Mr. John was just waiting there, waiting for us to start playing. I told him we couldn’t find our sticks. After that, he was just silent. He only said that the inauguration was in a month, and told us to practice at home and have a happy winter break as he left the classroom and the bell rang.

Even though I played percussion, Mr. John always said that everyone should practice, in fact he told percussion to bring their instruments home. So I had to embarrassingly roll my drumset to my house and squeeze it through my door.  

Over break, I tried to get better, but for some reason it just felt off. I was constantly hitting wrong notes, forgetting where I was, and also not counting beats correctly. I knew we couldn’t mess up playing at the inauguration, so I practiced and practiced all over break for hours until I finally managed to play it correctly for the first time. Second time was even easier, and then I felt very proficient at playing the anthem. So I entered class feeling very good about how I performed.

Later it was band class, I excitedly entered class, and then the bell rang. But only around 13 of the original 30 of us entered. “Where’s the rest of us?” I thought to myself. But I assumed they were just late while Mr. John wrote something on the whiteboard. It was a countdown to the days left until we leave for D.C. But he was also holding a piece of paper in his hands. And he started to read it. 

“Dear Mr. John,

I always enjoyed band class, but over break I just felt scared to play my instrument. It started when I dropped my piccolo, it fortunately wasn’t broken, however later that night I heard weird humming coming from somewhere, I was home alone, so I felt scared. But I mustered up the courage to find where those hums were coming from. It sounded like the star spangled banner, but slower and more distorted. I tried to find where those hums were coming from, so I grabbed a kitchen knife and turned my phone’s flashlight on and I heard it was coming from my instrument. “This can’t happen!” I thought to myself. “How does something that big fit inside a small case?” But those sounds only continued to get louder, as it started to turn into screams. I got scared and called the police while I ran outside, but when the police arrived they couldn’t find anything. So they left. I called my mom to explain to her the situation and she just told me to stay as she would drive back home quickly. We then slowly opened the instrument’s case when I told her it was coming from it, but there was nothing, however the sounds continued. And they got louder and louder. And we both freaked out and ran outside and stayed the night at the local hotel. And since then I’ve been afraid to play the instrument. So I’m writing to you this letter that I quit band and will find a different elective today.

- Sincerely, Sophia”

Me and the other kids were freaked out and were disturbed by that letter, but Mr. John ignored it and assumed Sophia was writing it as she didn’t want to play at the inauguration. After that, he told us to warm up, and after we did, he told us to start playing the star spangled banner. But while playing I accidentally dropped one of my sticks, and suddenly screams could be heard. Mr. John heard that and told us to stop playing, as he tried to see where the sound was coming from, and then he realized the sound was coming from the stick I dropped. But when he approached it, the sound stopped. “You gotta stop making pranks” Mr. John said as he started to head back. But the screams started again. “JONATHAN! STOP PRANKING US! THIS ISN’T A JOKE!” Mr. John yelled at me. “It-It’s not me!” I responded. After that Mr. John came back to me and grabbed the stick to give me a new one. Then he told us to play again.

But the rest of the band was too scared to play, they held their instruments in fear. So Mr. John just furiously announced that the inauguration was coming soon and he passed out permission slips for the D.C trip. Then the bell rang and we left. 

Days after days we preformed worse. Even though I practiced over break I still couldn’t seem to play without making mistakes. And so did the rest of the band. Sometimes the trumpets couldn’t make a sound from their instrument, sometimes the saxes and clarinets would chip their reeds, but it seemed to chip randomly. And everyone else was just hitting wrong notes, it felt like dark magic was stopping us from actually being able to play. And sooner but later it was the final class before the inauguration. And Mr. John made us rehearse, a ton. But for once we actually sounded good. Mr. John seemed happy, as we were now headed to D.C. But on the bus, I still hear those screams, those screams emerging from the depths of the bus
