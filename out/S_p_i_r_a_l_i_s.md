No one likes to find a stranger’s hair in their food.  Whether it be an embarrassing moment on a date, a sign of contamination at your local hole in the wall, or a whisper of infidelity in your marriage, it was not a fun experience.  So when I pulled the 12 inch long, thick black strand of hair out of my mouth, choking on the end that my throat tried to swallow, I was more than uncomfortable.  Especially since I wasn’t in a dirty restaurant, and I wasn’t married or in any kind of relationship.  I was 15 and in the comfort of my home, enjoying a meal our mom had made for us.



Our family was small.  Me, my baby brother, and our mom.  All of our hair was pretty short.  Theirs was red and mine was light brown, so I knew the hair didn’t come from any of us.



“Mom..??”  I held up the hair to show her.  She looked away from my younger brother as she was feeding him in his highchair and inspected what I was holding, her mouth twisting in disgust.



“Oh buddy, what in the world…?”



“It’s a hair, how the heck did it get in there?”  I kept holding it.  I was really grossed out but I didn’t want it to touch the table.  Mom pushed her thick, round glasses up her nose to get a closer look.



“Well… it must be one of my embroidery threads, that’s the only thing that would make sense.  Or it could be from one of the former residents.  I’m just so sorry it ended up in your food, bud...”  She gingerly took it from me.  It was wet and cold now, and made my skin shiver as she pulled it away from my hands to throw it in the green plastic garbage bin next to the kitchen counter.



We finished dinner, but I couldn’t stomach that much more.  I helped mom clean up as the sound of coughing upstairs, busy cars outside, and my little brother playing with his toys kept us company.  By the time we were finished with the dishes, I’d forgotten about the hair.



I brushed my teeth in the tiny, yellow-tiled bathroom while Mom washed Matty off in the tub.  I looked in the mirror, making sure I got my back teeth, as the warm bath made it fog over.



“Ben, can you watch him for me while I get a towel?”



“Uh-huh,” I replied through toothpaste foam.



She left the room and I bent down to spit, Matty giggling and splashing next to me.  When I lifted my head up to inspect my face in the misty glass, I saw Mom was back, standing behind me.  I grinned for a split second, before noticing how tall she was.  My eyes drifted up the mirror.  Her hair was so long.



Mom snapped me back to reality, coming back into the bathroom with a towel.  I splashed my face in the sink and rubbed my eyes.



“Don’t do that, you’ll get an astigmatism,” my mom snapped at me, lifting my brother out of the bath and drying him off.



I finished up and crawled into bed.  Mom set Matty in his crib right next to me.  I had this habit of not going to sleep until he did.  One time I fell asleep and he climbed up the crib bars and fell out.  My mom had to rush in to get him because I was dead asleep, didn’t hear him crying.  I don’t know why I didn’t wake up. 



I got chewed out and I’d been scared of something like that happening ever since.  So I waited until his quiet burbling turned into sleepy, tiny snores, and then shut my eyes, drifting off to the sound of his soft breath.



I had a dream about being a caterpillar.  I was still me, still looked like me, but I was sort of “worm-shaped” at the same time, almost like a grub. It’s that kind of dream logic where you keep going back and forth between being two different things, flashing from one perspective to another, like first person one second and third person another.  Except you’re also both things and seeing both perspectives at the same time.  



Anyway, I was me and I was a caterpillar, and I was climbing a tree.  It was hard because I was so heavy and round, and my many arms were short and stubby, like a baby's, except with more joints.  I clung to the bark with fleshy, fat appendages and after what felt like hours I finally reached the first branch, heaving with a sense of accomplishment.  I hung upside down from my legs, and could feel the blood rush to my head.  I then opened my mouth wide, too wide, which hurt my jaw.  I took my two front arms and reached inside my gaping maw. My hands brushed across my teeth, slid over my tongue, and down the entrance of my throat.  I felt my gag reflex activate, and with no control over myself, I grabbed what was inside and slowly began pulling it out, inch by inch.  My eyes stung with tears as they bubbled up and ran down across my forehead, but I couldn’t stop myself.  It felt like my nature.  I couldn’t fight it.



I pulled the thick, black strands of hair out of my throat, and as I did, my other limbs grabbed it and began meticulously wrapping it around my body.  Around and around and around…  It was covered in cold saliva, which helped it cling to my naked, wormy flesh, like hair on a shower wall.  Weaving layer after layer after layer… The ritual was complete once I was utterly engulfed in hair, blocking out all sounds, smells, elements… There was complete darkness.  The only thing I could sense was the feeling of being surrounded by softness, warmed by my body heat, which made me question whether I was still asleep or awake, snuggled up in the blankets of my room.  



I felt two hands, then four, reach in through the hair and start caressing my body.  



“I’m still dreaming,” I thought to myself.  Maybe this was the feeling of being changed into a butterfly; the hands of some unseen creator shaping me into something beautiful.



The hands tugged at my clothes and started pulling my hair hard.  Not with the benevolent intention to change, but the desire to take.



“Mmph..oww..” I murmured.  I could hear my own voice, could feel the warmth of it traveling up my throat and escaping my lips.  As soon as I made a sound, the hands shot off me and there was a rapid trill of footsteps, startling me awake.  I sat up just in time to see a flash of white leave my room.  



I sat in silence for a few seconds, clutching my heart as it hammered at my ribcage.  My eyes flicked toward Matty, who was sitting up and staring at the bedroom door, sucking on his fingers. I rubbed my eyes, looking up again.  The door was still slowly swinging from being opened.  I swung my legs over the side of my bed and silently walked to the chest in the corner of my room, grabbing a wooden bat and flashlight.



I looked at the dutifully ticking clock in the kitchen.  It was around 2:30.  It was storming outside, and I groaned in my head.  This cheap apartment building had tiny hidden entry points, and for some reason, when it rained, the floor became damp, and snails got in.  You had to watch where you stepped.  



I searched the cabinets in the kitchen first; under the sink and even the ones over the counter.  I scanned the flashlight over the living room, slowly stepping onto the dirty brown carpet.  I made my way to our yellow couch, looking around and behind it.  I nearly gave myself a heart attack when I turned around and the glare of the flashlight looked back at me in the screen of our small tv.  I laughed softly at myself and lowered the light, but instead of one figure in the reflection of the black, rounded screen, there were two.  One of them wore a white, thin night gown, and was standing on the couch.  She was very tall.  She had long, unkempt hair.



I spun around frantically and took a step back, wincing as my bare foot landed on a thin shell that gave way to slimy, squishy flesh.  I heard a shrill scream and my disoriented brain told me it came from the poor snail, but when the lights flickered on, my eyes were brought to the pink roller and bathrobe-clad woman in the living room entryway.



“Benjamin Michael Hartley, what the jeezums are you doing up at this hour??” Mom whispered shrilly, rubbing her temple.  “I thought somebody broke in, you scared me to death!”



I looked back at the couch.  No one was there.



“Mom…”  My voice cracked a bit.  I swallowed hard and lifted my foot, shell and slime and organs ascending with it.  I looked down and noticed black hair attached and mixed in with the carnage, dangling from my foot.  “Mom, were you the person in our room a second ago…?”



Her brows furrowed and her eyes widened.  Matty started crying.  Mom glanced back and forth between me and our room hesitantly before going to pick up my brother.



While holding him against her chest, we both checked over the apartment again.  It was easier and much less scary with the lights on, but the storm still cast shadows over the windows that kept me on edge.  Every once in a while the search was interrupted by a sickening squelch as another snail met its untimely demise in the haste of our mission.  No one was there.  Mom checked the locks on the door and made sure all of the windows were shut.



We all tried to sleep in Mom’s bed.  I think Matty was the only one who was able to throughout the night.  I was able to drift off for a bit after the sun began to rise.  



By the time I woke up, Mom was in the kitchen holding our telephone, twisting the teal curly-chord anxiously.  At one point her fingers got caught in it and she angrily flung it off her hand as she spoke in hushed tones to whoever was on the other end.  I silently watched, trying in vain to piece together the conversation.



Finally she set the phone down on the receiver and walked over to me. 



“Was… was that the police..?” I whispered gravely.



My mom let out a breathy laugh and rustled my hair, the details of her sleep deprived eyes magnified by the spectacles.  



“No, bud, just the landlord.  I asked him to come up and check things out.  I want to ask him about past residents, too.”



I looked around anxiously.  “Did he look at the security cameras?”



Mom smirked and nodded.  “Oh yeah. At least the ones that work. Nothin’. I doubt he’s able to actually see anything helpful on those boxes of junk anyway though.”



She must’ve seen how unnerved I still was so she pulled me into a tight hug.  “Hopefully it was just a bad dream, baby. Nothing more. Like the ones you got when you were younger.”



She went to the bathroom to take out her curlers while I sat in the middle of the sofa and waited for Rodney to climb the stairs to our apartment.  



My eyes wandered to the tv.  Only my reflection stared back.  The dull colors of the living room became duller still in the black glass.  I grabbed the remote next to me without looking at it and flipped it on, switching the few channels we got until I reached colorful static.  Hissing and singing and dancing across the once black screen.  My brows furrowed as I noticed my reflection still there.  One with the screen.  One with the static.  My figure bathed in color and black lines.  A snail slowly dragged its body across my reflection’s face.



I was awoken from my stupor by “shave-and-a-haircut” being rapped on the door.  I flipped the tv off and let Rod in.



“Benjiiii, ‘eeeeey…!” The greasy, fat man pulled me under his arm and gave me a noogie. He smelled like tobacco and whiskey.   “What’s this I hear about home intrusion? Don’tchu worry yo’ pretty little head, Benj, I gotchu and your Mamma covered.  Ain’t nothin’ comin’ in ‘ere without ol’ Rod’s big fat say-so.”  He winked and pointed two sausage thumbs at himself before tromping through the apartment, checking the door locks and windows by essentially shaking and hitting them.  I fixed my hair and followed him silently.  One thing I liked about Rodney was that I didn’t have to talk much when he was here.



Mom walked out of the bathroom to welcome him, red ringlets now framing her thin face.



“There she iiiis… ‘Prima Donna’ herself.”  He walked up to my mom and took her small hands into his big ones, holding them reassuringly.



Mom got him a cup of coffee and they talked a while on the couch about everything going on.



“Well now that yous mention it, there was a lady here before you guys.” He scratched his beard and squeezed his coffee mug while thinking.  “Wudn’t the… sociable type.  Very pretty, though, very pretty…”



I pretended to clean dishes while listening in on the conversation.  Watching the clouds, admiring Mom’s plants on the windowsill…



Mom leaned in closer to him, clutching her robe and speaking in a hushed tone as if I couldn’t hear from three feet away.  “Did… did she have long, black hair…?”



“Huh…? No, no actually.  Chick had blonde hair, almost white.  Very short, kinda chubby.  Cute, like a little chipmunk.”  He chuckled a bit before his laugh faded out into a serious sigh.  “Yeah… she died.”



“D-Died? How?” my mom gasped.



“Well, ‘dissapeared’, if yous wanna get into the techno-calities… happened overnight.  Never even saw her leave the buildin’.” 



“My word…why do you suspect she died?”



Rodney leaned back into the couch, digging into his pocket.



“Well, ‘cause she left this behind.  She always wore it.  Never woulda left anywhere without it.”



I peeked over to the living room at what he was holding.  It was a snail shell broach.



“Of course I wudn’t gonna be the one to fight the po-lice on they’s findings, could hurt business and all that… but yeah, she loved these slimy bastards.”  He twirled the pendant around in his meaty fingers.  “Kept ‘em as friggin' pets.  You know, I think…” he leaned forward again, “... she’s the one that let these damned things into the complex.  Dug out holes, somewhere nobody could find.  That way she could catch ‘em more easily or some crap like that…”



Mom let out an exasperated sigh.  “Was there *anybody* who lived here before us with long black hair?  There has to be some explanation for it.  It’s all around the apartment.”



“Not that I can think of off the top of my nog, but lotsa people been through this here building.  A lotta girls, a lotta guys, a lotta guys who brought in a lotta girls, yada yada, I try not to stick my schnoz too deep in another man’s beehive if you know what I mean…”



My mom thanked him after they searched the apartment one more time, and I stared at a plant in the middle of the windowsill.  It was a pale green, with strangely thin, sporadic leaves that reached up and cork-screwed in all directions.  I didn’t like to look at it.  I reached up, twirled one of the leaves around my finger.



“Well Benj, Donna…” Rodney shot two finger-guns at us.  “Yous take care.  Don’t be scared to call up ol’ Rod if that nightmare lady comes back a-knockin’.  I’ve always had a thing for tall chicks.”  He let out a raspy laugh until he coughed, squeezing our shoulders good-naturedly before leaving us.



Mom replaced the chain lock with a \*shink\* and pushed in the rest of the latches.



“You feel any better, bud?” she asked, rubbing my back.



“Honestly, not really,” I chuckled nervously.



She scrunched her face.  “Yeah… me neither.  Let’s eat breakfast.”



Mom called in sick and we had a really chill summer day at home.  We found a channel with cartoons and Matty tried to imitate the characters’ over-dramatic voices and expressions while Mom peacefully worked on her embroidery.



When I was younger, I watched a cartoon with a monster in it.  I can’t remember what it was called, something with knights and dragons and princesses, etc… One episode scared me so bad, that I had a nightmare.  



I was me, and I was a knight.  I had to get to the princess, to save her.  So I climbed all the way up a large, stone tower.  It didn’t have a door, only a window at the very top.  So I pain-stakingly grabbed hold of bricks and stones until I reached the opening, clambering inside.  But the princess wasn’t there.  The room was empty except for a big cellar door in the middle.  It was red, or maybe blue… The color of it changes every time I try to recall it.  But no matter what the color was, I knew that I had to go inside.  The princess was down there.



Have you ever had a really cool dream turn into a nightmare?



“RAWR!”  Matty was scrunching his nose and opening his eyes wide, slapping my legs as he did the best impression of the cartoon’s villain he possibly could.  He put his heart and soul into it.



“Ahh! Oh nooo!” I started tickling him.  “The monster’s gonna eat uuuus! Ahhhh! We have to fight back!”  He laughed until he ran out of breath as I poked him in the ribs.



As the day went on, spirits rose.  We watched tv, listened to music, ate a hairless dinner, and went to bed.



I waited for Matty to fall asleep. I sat up in bed for a few minutes longer, listening to the rain and watching a snail crawl up the wall, only to be met with the ceiling blocking his way to the sky.



I laid back down and let my eyes close.  To my surprise, I was back in that dream I had as a kid.  Standing at that cellar door.  I realized why I could never remember the color; it was constantly shifting.  Pixels of color moving and changing, hurting my eyes and yet drawing me in.



I was me, so I knew what would happen if I went down there, but I was also the knight, and I had to save the princess.  I was older now, and stronger, maybe things would go differently this time.



I swung open the door.



I took a step down the long, winding staircase.  It was dark, and damp, and cold.  Black, wet vines hung from the ceiling and hit my head and back as I descended.  Around and around and around.  Down into the swirling darkness.  The growth grew thick and I had to begin cutting at it with my sword.  At one point it got tangled up in the vines.  I pulled and pulled but couldn’t get it out.  I left it and began working at the vines with my teeth.  Tearing at them like an animal, obsessed with moving forward.  They were so thin and greasy, and they smelled horrible.  I could feel them getting caught in my throat and in between my teeth like floss, digging into my gums and making them bleed.  



I pushed forward and down.  Somehow the darkness grew darker in the tangle of these curly masses.  My foot tripped over one of the vines and lost traction with the ground, and my body hurled itself down the center of the staircase, straight into the abyss.  



The vines caught me right before I hit the bottom, strangling against my neck and popping a few of my joints out of socket from the force of falling.  I gagged and groaned and struggled futilely in the black restraints as I hung upside down, blood rushing to my head.  I craned my neck side to side.



“P-princess..?” I wheezed out desperately.  I heard my weak voice echo.  The base of the tower wasn’t large.  I knew that anyone who was down there with me would be very close by.



“Princess!” I forced out a shout.  The echo bounced off the walls violently, making me jump.  



I heard a very quick, wet drum of footsteps.  I yanked my head in the direction of the sound, but blackness shrouded everything.



I swung in a circle, somehow encapsulating myself even more in the vines.  I swung to look behind me, there was nothing.  But when I came back around, I could make out a vague shape in the shadows, hunched down on all limbs.  Each time I made a revolution, she was closer.  White nightgown, limbs long and lanky and pale.  Her entire face gone and replaced by what looked like a giant, twisted pucker.  He black hair was up in all directions, sticking to herself, the ground, the walls…



I ferociously began biting at the hair encasing me to no avail.  I swung back around and her horrible face was right up to mine.  It stunk.  A putrid mix of what smelled like body odor, old milk, and spoiled meat.  She brought up her four bony, white hands to hold me in place. I thrashed and whimpered and bit at the air.  



An awful squelching noise pierced my senses as her meaty face opened up like a camera shutter, welcoming the sight of a large, unblinking, otherworldly eye in the center.  I stopped moving, transfixed by her iris, shifting colors at an impossible pace, blending together and yet remaining separate.  There was so much love in that eye.  So much compassion.  Without a word she told me I didn’t need to be strong anymore.  She told me that everything that was and will be and could be worked in unity to bring us together in that moment.  Princess, monster, friend, enemy, goddess, Devil, all at the same time.  I didn’t have to be the knight and I didn’t have to be me.  I was allowed to be nothing.  I wanted to be nothing.  I wanted to give all of myself to her. 



Her long, spidery eyelashes slowly grew and reached toward me, pulling me closer to her beautiful, heavenly eye.  I felt them wrap around my ears and neck and braid themself into my hair.



She was her, and I would be her, all at the same time.



I woke up to my mom shaking me awake.  I could hear Matty crying in her other arm.  It must’ve happened again.



Instead of the disappointed, scowling look I was expecting, Mom looked concerned.  She was feeling my neck and my wrists, and I flinched in pain.  I looked at Matty, who was crying and reaching for me pitifully.



My mom pulled black strands away from my bruised skin and the worry on her face turned to determination.



I sat on the couch with a mug of hot chocolate my mom made for me, watching the white milk swirl into the brown brew,  while she was on the phone.  It was still storming outside.  I couldn’t remember a time it rained for so long.  I heard my mom swear and I looked over at her.



“I can’t get ahold of him or the police, storm must be messing with the phones or something… I’m going downstairs.”  She wrapped the robe around herself tighter and went to her room.



“But… but you’ll be alone! And what if she’s still in the apartment??” I protested, standing up, causing me to spill a bit of my hot chocolate.



She came out of her room brandishing a small revolver, holding it up to show me before placing it in her robe pocket.  



“You can keep your bat ready, but there is NO one in the apartment right now.  We checked everywhere.  The crazy bitch must’ve snuck back out… Somehow she’s getting through our locks and I need to talk to Rod about it now just in case she’s still in the building.  We can’t let her hurt anybody else.  There’s a lot of elderly people here.  The last thing they need is some crackheaded pervert breaking into their rooms.”  



She came up to me and kissed the top of my head before looking me in the eye.  “Hey, you’re gonna be okay.  You are so strong.  You have to stay here and look after Matthew, okay?”  I nodded reluctantly.  She walked up to the door and checked out the peep hole before opening it.  “Lock us up tight and push a chair under the door knob after I leave, okay?  I’ll be back in 10 at most.”



I was alone on the couch with Matty snuggled up next to me, already asleep again.  The rain pattering the building, the clock keeping track of my apprehension.  I watched it from the living room, watched the second hand go around and around and around… 3 times, then 5… 10…15… 



Shave-and-a-haircut.



I ran to the door, relief flooded my veins.  I looked through the peep hole and was happily met with Rodney’s big red nose looking back at me.  I undid the locks, moved the chair, and let him in.



“Heeey Benj, your Mamma around..?” he asked in an uncharacteristically serious tone.



My face went pale.  “She’s… she’s not with you?  You didn’t even pass her on the way up?”  



He scratched his chin in surprise. “N…No..? She tried callin’ me up a few times.  I answered but didn’t seem like she could hear me.  Everything a’ight, Benji…?”  



I didn’t answer him.  I grabbed my bat and flashlight and went straight back to the door.  Right before I left, I paused, looking over at our dining table.  I grabbed a pair of scissors out of Mom’s embroidery bag and stuck them in my pocket.  



“Watch Matty,” I instructed, before walking out and shutting the door behind me.



I carefully made my way down the beige hallway, over the green, snail infested carpet, my bat propped over my shoulder.  I pressed the elevator button maybe 10 times before giving up.



“I swear everything in this building is broken…” I muttered before heading to the stair railing.  I looked straight down, into the darkness.  I could’ve sworn it didn’t used to be that deep.  Grasping the flashlight with one hand and my bat with the other, I began the descent.



I winced as the stairs creaked underfoot.  The angles of the staircase were sharp, and every time I turned a corner I had to steel myself, my head filled with all sorts of abominations waiting in the dark to ambush me.



Down the stairs, platform after platform, more floors than I knew were possible...  Around and around and around…



I held my bat ready as my eyes caught something gleaming on the floor of the next platform.  I bent down to pick it up.



Round, thick-glassed spectacles, cracked and dripping with blood.  Caked in red there were a few strands of thick, black hair.  My eyes trailed it all the way across the floor, leading around the corner and down the stairs.  I followed it.



As I got deeper, any little light other than mine slowly succumbed to the darkness more and more.  The hair grew thicker, and extended across the walls and floors and stairs like veins.  It hung from the ceiling and seemed to grab at me more and more as I pushed forward.  At this point I decided to relinquish my bat, dropping it to the floor.  I reached into my pocket, pulling out Mom’s green scissors.  I hacked at the locks of hair that touched me, making sure my feet were freed up as well as I moved forward.



The stairs disappeared, and I knew I’d finally reached the bottom.  The room was wide and dark.  My light only revealed a foot or so in front of me, obscured by hair and dust.



I waited a few seconds in the silence, gathering up the courage to speak.



“M-Mom…?” I uttered.



“Mom!” I cried out.  There was no answer, but I could hear movement in the dark.



I stayed close to the wall as I made my way around the room.  I stopped dead in my tracks as I felt a large lump in the thick wall of hair.  I scanned my flashlight upwards until I got to my mom’s face, her motionless body entombed against the wall, hair stuffed into her mouth and down her throat.  I desperately clawed at the wall, dropping my flashlight and cutting into the black tendrils.  Eventually I got enough that the rest of the strands snapped, making a musical tearing sound, and Mom slumped onto the floor.  I slowly pulled the hair inch by inch out of her throat.  She lay there unconscious, letting out sick, croaky breaths.  I bent down to check on her when something grabbed my ankle, dragging me animalistically to the center of the room.



I recognized her smell, the clammy feeling of her fingers on my skin, as she forced me onto my back, slamming my head against the concrete floor, making me see stars.  Everything was every color.  Her face was tv static.  Her eye was beautiful.  She was two people at the same time.  I wanted to be her, too.



I heard Matty crying upstairs.  It was so faint, but shot through the fog.



With all my strength, I drove the scissors upward.



She stopped them mere centimeters away from her pupil, forcing the scissors away from my hand by squeezing it ‘til my bones cracked and popped.  She began tearing chunks of hair from my scalp.  I screamed weakly as hot tears streamed down my cheeks.   I tried closing my eyes but she used two of her hands to force them open.  



Right as I was beginning to fall back under her spell, I felt something crawl across my forehead, and suddenly she froze in place, as if transfixed.  I saw a blur of the snail slowly inch between my eyes, and I took the one opportunity of clear-headedness to kick her as hard as I could in the stomach.  She stumbled backwards and collected herself, looking up and beginning to clamber back towards me before she was interrupted by getting shot in the face.



She fell backwards and I looked behind to follow the figure of my mom limping forward until she was hovering over the sputtering monster.  She promptly drove her slipper into its face, over and over and over, until it was a motionless, soundless pulp.  She took a step back and we both watched apprehensively as the bloody pile of ground beef slowly pushed out the large, juicy eyeball from its center.  It rolled onto the floor, all the heavenly light that came from it gone forever.



The head of the monster writhed and squirmed as the eyeball was followed by a bloody hand emerging from the carnage, and then a whole arm, and then a whole person.  She wore nothing but a nightgown, now stained red with blood.  She was completely bald, but her eyelashes were very blonde, almost white.



She was coughing and heaving in the air, crawling towards us.  My mom immediately went to help her, pulling her up and wrapping an arm around her, and I followed suit.



We all walked up the stairs together.  It was a far shorter trip up than down, and even after everything that happened, the climb felt easy.  



My mom and Rod talked to the snail lady in the living room, asking her all kinds of questions, even though I’m sure they realized they couldn’t get all the answers.  



I washed dishes while they spoke to her, and at one point my eyes met hers.  She smiled warmly at me, and without a word, we expressed how thankful we were that both of us had a piece of ourselves that was worth holding onto.



I turned off the kitchen sink, and watched the water spiral down the drain.
