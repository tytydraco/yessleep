I never thought I’d be one of those people who believed in ghosts. I always rolled my eyes at the so-called “haunted house” stories and laughed off the claims of people seeing shadow figures or hearing whispers in the dark. But here I am, sitting in my new apartment, writing this because I have no other choice. If I don’t get this off my chest, I’m going to lose my mind.

It all started when I moved into the old apartment building on Oak Street. The place was dirt cheap, which was why I jumped on the offer without thinking twice. Sure, it was a bit run down, with peeling paint on the walls and squeaky floors, but the price was right, and I’d been living in a cramped, expensive place for too long. I was just looking for somewhere to crash, a place to call home until I figured things out.

The first few days were uneventful. The building was quiet, and most of the neighbors kept to themselves. I didn’t mind the solitude. I worked long hours, coming home only to eat, sleep, and repeat. It wasn’t until the seventh night that things started to change.

It was late. I had just gotten out of the shower, steam filling the bathroom as I grabbed for a towel. That’s when I saw him.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light. I’d glanced at the bathroom mirror, and there, standing behind me, was a man. His reflection stared back at me, his face twisted into an expression I can only describe as malevolent. His eyes were dark, hollow, and his mouth pulled back into a grin that seemed to stretch just a little too wide, like he was mocking me. He was just standing there, not moving, just... watching.

I froze. I know it sounds crazy, but I didn’t turn around. I couldn’t. I couldn’t even move. All I could do was stare at the reflection, my heart hammering in my chest. I swear, I could feel his presence in the room, like something cold and suffocating pressing against my skin. And then, just like that, I blinked, and he was gone.

I spun around. The bathroom was empty. Nothing. Just me, the steam, and the faint glow of the light above. I was shaking now, my towel slipping from my hands as I gripped the edge of the sink to steady myself. But I told myself it was nothing. Just my imagination, I thought. The mirror had fogged up, and the shadows had played tricks on me. Maybe I was just tired. I’d been working a lot. That’s what I kept telling myself.

But the next morning, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I couldn’t stop thinking about the man in the mirror, and I started noticing things. Little things. Like how the mirrors in my apartment never seemed to stay clean. I’d wipe them down, but the next day, they’d have streaks, smudges, fingerprints—always in the same spots. I’d find myself glancing at the bathroom mirror when I passed it, but each time, I saw nothing. Just my reflection.

That is, until the second night.

I had just gotten home from work, exhausted, and had barely eaten before I stumbled to my bed, hoping to catch a few hours of sleep. I pulled the covers over my head, but as soon as I closed my eyes, I heard it.

Whispers.

Low, barely audible, like someone was speaking just out of reach. I lay still, holding my breath, straining to hear. The whispers grew louder, like they were coming from the bathroom. I slowly sat up, my heart racing, and then the noise stopped. Complete silence.

I tried to shake it off. Maybe it was the wind, or the building settling, or some other rational explanation. But as I lay back down, trying to convince myself to sleep, I felt it. A cold breeze brushed across my face, chilling me to the bone. I opened my eyes and saw him.

There, standing by the bathroom door, was the man. He was just standing there, not moving, his face obscured in the shadows. I could feel his eyes on me, even though I couldn’t see them clearly. That grin. That awful, mocking grin was there again.

I sat up in bed, my legs shaking, my mind racing. Was he real? Was this really happening? I blinked again, and he was gone. But I couldn’t escape the feeling that he was still there, lurking in the corners of my vision, waiting for me to turn my back.

That was when I decided to look into the history of the building. Maybe there was something—something I was missing. Something that could explain this.

The building, I learned, was much older than I thought. It was built in the 1920s and had a long history of strange occurrences. The most unsettling part, however, was the story of a man named Samuel Gray. In the early 1940s, Samuel had been found dead in apartment 3B, the very apartment I was staying in, hanging from the ceiling with a note that read, “I’ll never leave.”

No one knew the exact circumstances of his death, but some said it was a suicide. Others claimed it was murder. But there was one thing everyone agreed on—after Samuel’s death, the apartment was never quite the same. Renters came and went, always citing strange happenings: objects moving on their own, cold spots, and, most disturbingly, reports of someone watching them in the mirrors.

I should’ve left then. I should’ve packed up and never looked back. But I didn’t. I didn’t know how to.

And so, I stayed.

The whispers never stopped. They followed me, growing louder every night, as though the man was always just a step behind me, waiting for me to turn around. Sometimes, I’d hear him in the mirrors—his breath fogging up the glass, his face appearing out of nowhere when I wasn’t looking. I could feel him getting closer, his presence inescapable, suffocating.

By the fourth night, I couldn’t take it anymore. I packed up, thinking that if I just left the apartment, I’d be free. I called a moving company and left that evening. I didn’t even look back.

But today, as I passed a store window on my way to work, I saw him.

I saw his face, pressed against the glass, that same grin stretched across his features.

He’s following me. He’s everywhere. And no matter how far I run, I can’t escape him.

I don’t know how much longer I have before he catches up to me.

But I swear—if you see someone in your mirror tonight, if you feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up... don’t look away.

Because he’s out there.

And he’s waiting for you.
