	In 1973 I had just made my way out of high school and into an entirely unforgiving world. One which had no interest in supporting my needs. Without parents, who had long separated and abandoned their lives, and no discernible skills to set myself apart, money came slow. I lived under the heel of one Mr. Harrison Furgen, ruler of the desolate and depressing cafe establishment, Furgen’s Mug. Being one of many such institutions in our city streets, dust fell over unused booths while the coffee makers hydrated no one but Mr. Furgen and myself. Simply looking at the store’s exterior might entirely suck the life right out of you. For my shifts, consisting of only staring out a window into the street and occasionally sweeping a boot-printless tile floor, the abysmal pay of 50 cents an hour may have been appropriate, ignoring how legal it may have been. I used to ponder, during my banal work, how Mr. Furgen could possibly afford to keep the shop open all these years. I concluded I was likely contributing to a money laundering operation. 

	It was one day in the middle of  June when through the smouldering city streets, filled with factory smog created by the mass underpaid labour that defined this county, a man appeared. I believe I was asleep sitting at the counter with my head hunched down as I usually was when the unfamiliar jingle of the cafe’s door echoed through the silent establishment. 
“Hello sir, how’s it going today?”
	He was a completely unassuming elderly man, normal and charming in every sense. At what I would have guessed to be around 70 years old, he stood slightly hunched but on his own. Walking slowly with the gate of one just happy to be alive. Circular spectacles sat upon his round nose and rosy cheeks, too large for his face and magnifying his eyes slightly under the power of their prescription. His head very slightly nodding up and down with the shakiness of an elderly. He seemed to glint under the light of the smoke-shrouded sunrise as he removed his hat to let out his thinning hair . He took off his jacket to take a seat in front of me. 
	“Oh, I’m doing just fine son, and how are you? Shop doesn’t seem awfully busy; am I all you’ve served this morning?”
	“This must be your first time here sir, you’ve got to be the first customer in three days.” I said with an awkward chuckle.
	He laughed back. “Why do you bother comin’ in if there’s no one here lad? If I may ask.”
	I observed how his smile was so welcoming and kind. It radiated the simple joy of someone in love with people, and the conversation at hand. Like no matter what you said next, he would earnestly care. Inviting, is how I’d describe it I guess. 
“Well I just need it sir, not much I can do ya’ see.”
“Surely you don’t own such a shop at your young age son?”
I snickered at the thought I’d ever make it that far in life.
	“No, no. I do believe I’m the only employee though. I’m surprised Mr. Furgen can even afford to pay me anymore.” Adding “Not that he really does,” under my breath.
	As he laughed, the man adjusted his glasses and said, “Indeed it’s a tough world right now. So many people with nothing to do I’m afraid. But it’s going to be alright, we all just have to remember that son.”
“Of course, sir.”
“No need to call me sir young man, the name’s Albert Seamore.”
“Nathan Wesley. What can I get for you, Mr. Seamore?”
	He ordered a small brew of coffee with more milk, cream, and sugar than one would expect from a man his age. I turned away to begin fulfilling his order and a calming pause in conversation fell upon Furgen’s coffee, accented by the quiet hum of machinery and whispers of the morning radio. 
	“Ya’ know son, if you’re looking for a better job than this one I can help you out.”
	“Well I’ll take whatever I can get Mr. Seamore. The truth is my shifts aren’t all that exciting, and the pay certainly isn’t any better, believe it or not.”
	He chuckled at my attempt at humour and I found myself laughing along with him as I made his drink.
	“Well you see I own a small bit of land up north out of the city. I’ve been living there alone but as I get older I find I’m unable to maintain it. Hard work supporting even the smallest farms with a back like mine. It’s a lovely place though son, old house that creaks with each step, but it’s home. I could use some help if you’re interested, lad.”
	I was shocked. The only customer in days walks in and just offers me an escape from this deathly mundane job and the city’s reek of burning labour. I stopped my work and turned to him. “Oh well, that’s quite kind of you Mr. Seamore sir…I- I frankly am not sure what to say.” He smiled as I collected my next words, welcoming any response at all. “I mean, h- how far is it? Where would I stay?”
	“Oh it’s about an hour drive up north once the city ends and becomes the farm and woodland. But, no worries son, I’ve got a comfortable guest room you can stay in and fit to your sort while you’re there on the job. Of course there’s no pressure at all, son. Just thought a young lad like you might appreciate the quiet and the pay. It’s a- it’s a peaceful life up there ya’ know.”
	At this point I was convinced it was God that walked into the shop that morning.
	For another half hour the two of us discussed what tasks I would be assigned to do around his property. His explanations painted a soothing picture of quaint farm life where my only concerns would be mowing lawns, tilling soil, sweeping floors, etc. I began to think of it as a great pause in my life. For two summer months I would be fed and housed, away from the world, and I would miss nothing. I could catch up in life, get on my feet, and only once I was ready to return would the world keep spinning.
	As he left, we parted with the agreement to write me a letter with further information within the next few days, and a firm handshake. For the first time in years I was hopeful. I did not hesitate to leave my rat filled moldy apartment and severe absence of human connection when Mr. Albert Seamore’s letter arrived the following week.
To my dearest future caretaker, Nathan Wesley:
Hello Mr. Wesley, I pray this letter arrives without delay and finds you well and as eager to start this next chapter as you were the other day. If you still are of course, you’re free to arrive anytime from June 28th to August 1st. You’re all prepared for your living, however I wasn’t certain about some of your preferences so we can settle some things once you arrive. I want you to be as comfortable as possible. Specifically, I did not know if you prefer silk or cotton sheets so I bought both. Do not worry about your first days being hard, I’ll show you around and introduce the basic aspects of your duties, so you can be comfortable. As for directions…
	The letter continues on describing a convoluted twisting path through a hundred miles of woods. 

	Without a car, I took a taxi and, to the begrudging driver, I read the disorienting instructions as we went further down our hour-long journey. I’m sure Mr. Seamore would have gladly picked me up and driven back, but I felt guilty at how accommodating he had been already. After several wrong turns and a close call with a deer, a stone and wood house began to peek out from between the trees. The now miserable driver dropped me off to walk the last stretch.
	As I descended the small gravel road, carrying two suitcases of what little possessions I had, making the last gradual turn before my destination, it was then, the property of Mr. Albert Seamore opened up to me. 
	The two-story residence of Mr. Seamore appeared as a thousand year old relic of a simpler time. Crafted of logs and cobblestone, the structure appeared to have been expanded upon dozens of times throughout the years it stood. Sections of differing material jutted off in unnatural directions that surely called the structural integrity of the house into question. I could only imagine the inside was a maze of unnatural hallways, curving, raising and lowering in all manners of an unprofessionally modded home. Of course I would come to find I was right. 
	I was wondering what Mr. Seamore could have needed so much room for when the front door creaked open inwards and the torn screen door creaked open outwards. 
	“Nathan, it’s good to see you! I’m glad you decided to come, my boy. How was the journey up here.”
	“Hey, Mr. Seamore. It’s nice to see you too. It was uh…good.” I said nervously.
	“Oh no need for formalities son. I want you to be comfortable here. Call me Albert.” His infectious smile had made its way to me now.
	“Oh-oh. Of course.” Of course, my reciprocal grin was awfully awkward.
	I explained my turbulent journey north and as I predicted, Mr. Seamore said I should have just written to him and he would have gladly picked me up all the way from the city. In the first week I knew the man, he was only ever accommodating, respectful, and contagiously joyous. 

	He showed me to my small quarters first, leading me through cramped hallways of varying floral wallpapers, quaint living rooms filled with hand crafted furniture and various assortments of trinkets collected over a lifetime, and a humble dining room. Small table accompanied by two seats and decorated dishes. I did not however notice any photos throughout the house. Only meaningless abstract paintings on the walls.
	My bedroom consisted only of a small single bed and a nightstand, a lamp on top and a small storage space behind a panel in the wall. I decided to leave my cigarettes there. Mr. Seamore had clearly made an effort to suit the quarters as best he could to my unfamiliar young self, based only on our limited interactions. Two sets of sheets were folded at the foot of the bed, and various posters of relevant rock bands adorned the walls. Personally I didn’t care for Lynyrd Skynyrd, but it was the thought that counted I guess. If anything I appreciated such unnecessary effort to connect and make me comfortable.	
	My duties were simple. Rake leaves, till soil, mow the lawn. Any task too laborious for an old gentleman like Mr. Seamore; I would have done. Under the baking sun, clothes sticking to my skin as they soaked my sweat, I would look out over the heat haze on the corn field to think about how lucky I was for the change. 
	Most days Mr. Seamore was gone doing whatever activities he was still able to, out in the city. Whenever asked about his daytime goings he would reply along the lines of: “Oh I just enjoy the walking. It’s all I can do anymore son.”
	One might think the monotony of the labour, ever the same vista, and one man for company would begin to grind away at me as I grew sick of apathy. However, when you spend years of your life working in Fergun’s Mug, boredom is impossible. I suspect that Mr. Seamore, on the other hand, had long grown tired of the routine, and really just needed me as company in his lonely existence. I sometimes wondered how he kept such a jolly attitude cooped up in his labyrinth of a home before I came along. In fact, I often wondered what went on in such a place before myself.
	Rarely in my first week would I encounter anomalies in my work. It was only on the morning of my eighth day when I remarked a swarm of flies gathering above a patch of crop. 
	“Weird.” I thought. 
	In moments of suspense the howling wind changes from comforting white noise, to an eerie tunnel pulling you towards the unknown. And pull it did, as I creeped towards the dark between the wheat. Where had the sound of the birds gone? Finally, I brushed away the small swarm and patted my way across the surrounding dirt. I didn’t find anything. I didn’t smell anything. And I continued my work.

	On the tenth day I was cleaning the interior of the house when I realized I had not yet cared for Mr. Seamore’s master bedroom, though of course ‘master’ is a highly exaggerated description for the room. It was hardly larger than my own, and seemed to be located at a cross section of multiple renovations on the home. As an unnatural four sided shaped room, the old man’s bed did not sit flush with the wall. One wall was red brick, the other shambled wood, and the other two drywall. Frankly, it was a much worse room than the one that I was residing in. I guessed that Mr. Seamore was much too humble. Noticing scratches and general dust on his ancient hardwood floor, I decided to do the man a favour and sweep up, surprising him with a refurbished chamber not on the list of my tasks for the day. He at least deserved a comfortable sleep.
	A gentle breeze flew through unseen gaps in the architecture as I gently worked away. After a few minutes and a quick brush beneath the shadow of his bed, a small black square drifted out with the debris. Picking it up, I realized a single exposure, cut out from a roll of film I presumed, was between my fingers. In the transparent dark red impression I made out a man resembling a slightly younger Albert Seamore, standing with his arm around the shoulder of a similarly aged woman, and behind a young girl of what I guessed to be 3 or 4 years old. I was highly surprised at the discovery of what was likely Mr. Seamore’s family. Something about his living arrangement implied he hadn’t been close to anyone in his life. “What happened to them?” I wondered as I put the photo back in its shroud of darkness, noting the old man’s unfamiliar lack of warmth. 
	Later that night Mr. Seamore pulled into the gravel driveway followed by a cloud of dust.
	“Hey, son, I noticed my uh- my room was extra tidy today. Did you-“
	“Oh yes. I just had extra time and thought I’d do you something nice, that’s all.” I smiled
	I remember in that moment, Mr. Seamore’s smile faltered. I was not sure if it was actually what happened on his face, but it was what I saw.
	“Oh well, I appreciate the hard work lad…But ya’ know I do value some privacy so…Don’t you worry about my own room. I can still manage that at least.” He chuckled and his familiar smile returned. 
	Shifting his glasses with a wrinkle of his nose, he got up from our small dining table and announced his departure to his quarters. We exchanged good nights, but I couldn’t help it. I just couldn’t help but ask. 
	“Do you have any family, Mr. Seamore.”
	He paused on his way up the steps. His spectacle inflated eye peaked over his hunched shoulder as his head gently shook. 
	“Oh no no, never met the right someone I suppose. Never did good with love anyways. Your company’s just enough.”
	He turned and walked into the darkness.

	The next morning, I found the house untouched from the night before and despite not hearing the huff of snoring emerging from his doorway, I concluded Mr. Seamore was just sleeping in. A common occurrence in the flexible and practically empty schedule of an elderly man like him.
	 While making myself breakfast, the house creaked with each of my steps, echoing slightly to break the quiet morning air. 
	My work of the day began with spreading fertilizer across the crops. In the now intimately familiar field, I toiled away. The waist high growth brushed against each other in the wind, creating a musical shimmer. In this meditative state paranoia began to bubble up in my spine. My skin tingled under the sensation of being watched. Whipping up I quickly surveyed the land around me, stopping as I became aware of a dark silhouette standing a few hundred feet away, next to the tree line. 
	It was Mr. Seamore. Looking at me.
	In the split second our gazes met I could note no discernible emotion in the grooves and wrinkles of his usually friendly face. His head was still, absent of its usual shiver. However, on the other end of a momentary blink, darkness gave way to his signature smile and nod. He waved and motioned for me to continue whatever it was I was doing. I did not turn away but he did, walking back towards the house.
	I did not get much work done that day. Mr. Seamore was not a threatening man, but in my usual isolated routine, the idea of anyone spectating, unknown to me but for the bumps on my neck, was heavily distracting. 

	When I retired to join the old man in the house, I decided to ask about it.
	“Hey, uh- Albert. Why were you watching me uh- work this morning?”
	“Oh! Sorry son; didn’t mean to startle ya’. Just stayed home today and wanted to check on your work, lad. And I’m glad to know you’re doing great. You’re a hard working boy, Nathan.” He smiled.
	“Oh well, I appreciate that sir. You were sleeping in this morning and I didn’t want to wake you, so I just started tidying the back shed.”
	“Ah- yes- yes. Thanks for that. I find I need more and more sleep each day. Guess it’s all part of getting old.” He said, exhaling and shaking his head.
	I found his answer adequate and my worries were slightly alleviated.
	“Say, do you smoke sir? I was thinking I’d have a smoke out on the porch and watch the sunset, if you care to join me.”
	“No, no. Ya’ don’t get to my old age by smoking, son. But I’d love to join you; that sounds lovely.”
	I went upstairs to my room and retrieved a pack of cigarettes from the small leather bag I kept in the wall compartment. I met Mr. Seamore on the porch which he was already sat. Rocking in his chair, a second empty for me a few feet adjacent.
	The two of us conversed here and there about life and whatnot, but mostly we sat in silence, watching the great ball of flame melt upon the horizon of pine. I believe it’s when you can sit in the absence of conversation and remain comfortable, that you truly know someone. I was contemplating that when the old man said:
	“Are you happy here, my boy? It’s been nearly two weeks now and you’ve been an incredible help. I sincerely hope you don’t die of boredom up here.”
	“No, no sir. I actually enjoy the serenity.”
	“Well that’s good. Young folk are always chasing something so big. But I learned in my own youth that you rarely make it that far. But ya’ got to be okay with that, ya’ know?”
	“Well, I never had any great ambitions to begin with sir. I guess I’m similar to you, I’m okay with something quaint. All I ever wanted was to leave the city. The constant whirring really got to be.”
	“Ah, I get that my boy.”
	In a lapse of conversation I decided to ask:
	“But.. do you ever think about what life would’ve been, if you went for something greater?”
	He thought for a moment. “No, I guess I lost that curiosity long ago. The majority of my life has been small. But I’m happy. I’m happy here.”
	“It is very nice here, Albert. I think I get it.”
	When the sun disappeared, we retreated to our beds. That night’s sleep came reluctantly as the house creaked more than usual.

	The morning of my twelfth day began the same as the last 11. I ate breakfast with Mr. Seamore and bid him farewell as he left in his rusty truck on another voyage to god knows where. After mowing the expansive lawn I began cleaning inside the many purposeless rooms of the house that sat collecting dust.
	A muted and singular thud rang out from the second floor above me.
	I froze. I was alone. Above me, I was fairly sure, was Mr. Seamore’s room.
	I cautiously made my way upstairs and noticed the old man’s door slightly ajar. Of course I had questions about what lay in there after my previous discovery, and of course the noise and unshut door irrefutably invited me in. 
	Inside, the room was nearly as I left it two days ago, just slightly used, bedsheets unmade, minimal dust buildup, etc. The air of the place seemed to carry whispered secrets as it sucked up all the gentle noises the structure regularly extruded. I looked around for a few minutes when I noticed the subtle scratch marks on the floor had grown in intensity. They seemed to lead in a curved path from the wood panelled wall. Gazing over the surface I observed a spot where the end of five panels, from the ground to about four feet up, lined up in a straight break. After a bit of prying and elbow grease my self doubt and thoughts of irrational paranoia were alleviated as the panels gave way to a hinged trapdoor. I only stole a quick glance inside the small room before I heard the front door clatter and squeak open. I hastily shut the compartment and left Mr. Seamore’s door ajar as it was before. Looking down the stairway I saw him dropping his keys and taking a seat on the couch.
	“Oh hey there son. How’s it going?” He said pleasantly after seeing me.
	“I’m- I’m doing just fine…uh- just tidying my own room. Ya’ know I- I kinda neglected it with my other jobs and such.”
	“Ah, makes sense. Some folks need a tidy place to sleep like that.” He scratched the back of his neck. 
	“Yeah, yeah…what are you doing home so early?” It was only 11.
	“I hope you weren’t somewhere you’re not supposed to be.”
	“Huh?” My face dropped and a bead of sweat left my brow to tap the step beneath me.
	“Huh? Oh sorry. Yeah I just went out to watch a film in the city. Didn’t much feel like sticking around once it ended. Thought I might as well come home.”
	“Oh okay, yeah…”
	I avoided the old man for the rest of the day.
	I could only see it for a second. Hundreds of unlit candles lay melted into one amalgamation on the chamber’s floor. Drapes of rag hung from the ceiling in flowing patterns, as if the room itself wore a veil. Upon the limited surface area of the walls hung many paintings of swirling black that created impressions of forms I did not know. On every inch of wood between such frames were the scribbles and ramblings of incomprehensible… ideas? Prayers? I have no clue. 
	I found that after that day I did not want to stay with Mr. Albert Seamore any longer.

	After two weeks I had had my fill of this property and was paid an adequate enough amount so that I was more than okay with leaving. I did not know what the old man had going on, what secrets he held about his past and present, but I was not about to be involved. So, on the fourteenth day, I approached Mr. Seamore to announce my resignation. He was home by five and I had finished my final work.
	“Uh… sir. May I have a word.”
	“Oh, of course son. What do you need?”
	“I think I’m- I think I’m going to go home now. I think I’ve uh- worked here long enough, I think.”
	His smile dropped slightly and a look of concern infected his features. “Oh well that’s a shame. I do so enjoy the company and you’re a mighty help. I really don’t know how I’ll keep this place going without you. Do ya’ need more money? Ya’ need only ask my boy.”
	“No, no that’s okay…I just think I may be more well off in the city now… try and make something of myself now… if that’s alright.”
	He grew more stern. “But I thought you liked it here. Do you not like it here?”
	“Oh no Mr. Seamore I do enjoy this place I- I just feel as though I’m falling behind. Like I better catch up with the worl-”
	“Call me Albert.”
	I paused. “Oh… okay”
	“I think ya’ best stay another day or two to see how ya’ feel boy.”
	“I really think-“
	“No, I think ya’ best stay.”
	His face had completely dropped now. I had never seen the man so cold. 
	I retreated. Without a phone or my own car, what was I going to do? I just crept backwards towards the stairs, maintaining eye contact with my captor. On the first step I turned and hastily went to my room. 
	I was practically silent for dinner. As we ate the clank of dishware and gated chewing was interrupted by the old man’s attempts at conversation.
	“Ya’ know boy, I saw a young lad who looked just like you in town today. Good lookin’ fella working down at the bowling alley. Uh, what was his name…Ricky? Roger? Ah! It was Roger, definitely Roger.”
	“Oh uh… yeah.”
	I came to the conclusion that night that I would simply steal the man’s truck in the shadow of darkness. He always left his keys hanging at the front door. All I would have to do is take a drive to the nearest town, get his truck towed back to his driveway in the night, back in time for his morning expedition. I would just take a taxi the rest of the way, and live the rest of my life in some distant place, likely safe from the possibility of ever reuniting with Mr. Albert Seamore.

	After laying awake for what I assumed could only have been a dozen hours, the sun long set outside my window, I got up. Gently tip-toeing across the delicate hardwood I tried my best not to make the house scream. I held my breath as I traversed the short, tangled path to the stairs. On the eighth step they cracked, on the twelfth I was free. Approaching the front door I found the old man’s keys, hung on a small, ornate wall fixture, decorated with a small quilted keychain. I grabbed them.
	My final obstacle was the door. It seemed to tower above me. Scraped and eroded with age, the wood was filled with deep scratches. I knew if I opened it, it would shriek. It would crack a wide chasm in the silence of night as it violently squealed open. As if a siren, my presence would be known. But I didn’t care. I gently, but quickly swung the door open. It cracked only once. I did the same with the screen door. It cracked only twice. To me, my escape was guaranteed, so I just prayed the sounds would blend in with the normal, nightly voices of the structure. 
	Speeding across the gravel driveway, my bare feet were agonized by the jagged rock. It was just me out there. I know it was. That night was so quiet. It was just my frantic footsteps and my heaving breath in that darkness. It was just me flinging open the car door and leaping into the driver’s seat, seconds away from launching the key into the ignition to let loose the roar of an engine into the silence. 	But it was not just me.
	 It was not just me, when I looked to my left and met with the spectacle magnified, bug-like pupils of Albert Seamore. An inch away from the glass, his breath laid a patch of fog on the glass. 
	“What are you doing, Nathan?”
	“I-“
	“Go back to bed, son. Go back to bed, son.” He showed no discernible expression as he slowly opened the car door. I was frozen.
	“Go back to bed, son.”
	I stepped out slowly, awkwardly maneuvering around the man as he stood still, only turning his head to maintain his gaze.
	“You should go back to bed, son.”
	He slowly pointed to the front door, still ajar. I was compelled, yet reluctant, to turn my back to the man and do as he said. And I did. I felt his searing eyes burn holes in the back of my head as I walked all the way back to my room. I never heard him move away from his stance at the car, though I felt the eyes the entire way. Of course I never slept.
	Hours of paralyzing fear passed like a thousand. Once my terror had ever so slightly dissipated, deciding that if I was in physical danger I would likely have suffered such by now, vulnerable and helpless as I was in that room, I got up. I got up and stood there for a long time. In the dread my legs’ ache became obsolete. After this small lapse I continued gently towards the window. I felt I needed to look out. I needed to see outside. 
	And solitary in the field there stood a man. Torch flame alight in his hand, he was still. Facing away from me, the flickering light illuminated the surrounding crop, painting a vivid red line around his hunched form. He did nothing at all. 
	For thirty minutes, I watched him stand like that. I was not sure if I had happened to look out the window around the same time his presence befell the field, or if he had stood there for hours before. But, soon his neck craned. His head turned to me. Right into my window, his gaze fell. I ducked quickly, but there was no way he would have even seen me from so far away, in a dark window to a dark room, what difference would a silhouette make on the black, right?
	I sat under that window until dawn arrived.

	In the morning, so exhausted my eyes ached as if melting out the bags beneath them, I slumped downstairs cautiously. A singular piece of paper, ripped from something larger, sat on the countertop. It read:
I will be leaving for a few days. It will be okay. We will be okay.
	He wasn’t lying, his truck was gone, the house was quiet, and I was completely alone. I knew what I had to do.
	Unworried about monitoring my volume I clattered upstairs to the place in the wall. Prying open the panelling, the trapdoor swung open. Before me was a small room as I had seen before, the area of which could not have been larger than 16 square feet and five feet tall. I imagine one could only sit down in there, on the small area of bare floor in the center. The monster of candles stretching over the room was alight on hundreds of its wicks. Along with the indecipherable scribblings and paintings I had seen before, the center of the opposite wall presented a portrait of something I couldn’t understand. Even through the paint strokes of adaptation, I was beneath its power. I had no idea what was being depicted, but I made out an eye in the chaos. A small dot I could only assume looked down on me. What was I witnessing in this snapshot of artistic expression? What could it possibly be?
	Below the work, an ancient note read:
I love you, oh Great One
	Beneath was a small red cloth draped over a small table, on top was something that made me fall back in shock. An offering, I assumed, sat there. A small skull, old and grey, shattered and collapsed at the right temple, a second set of teeth above the first, on both the bottom and top jaws. I slammed the trapdoor shut. Inside I locked every possible point of entrance, even barricading the front and my bedroom doors. Stacked high were the old man’s antique furniture against everything. 
	I don’t know what I planned to do, perhaps I thought an angel would descend and take me away from Albert Seamore’s hell. I just didn’t want him to come back, I never wanted to see him again. I guess I planned to kill him upon his arrival proceeding his current escapade, so I set up any jangly devices, bells and windchimes, etc, that I could find. Set along each doorway I knew when the old man came along I would be prepared. I went to bed with an axe meant for wood chopping next to me.

	Laying sleepless in the night, fist tight around the wooden grip, I heard murmurings. Creaks and echoes of the house shattered my ears as they came. I flinched and writhed of fear each time the wind tunnelled through a hallway and rumbled the delicate frames of my prison. I could’ve sworn I heard impossible whispers in other rooms. Multiple voices below, adjacent, above, outside. Conversations of the night tormented me with their vague existence. I convinced myself none of it meant anything.
	But then a whisper came from my own room.
	So close to my ear that I felt the air of breath.
	“I love you…” 
	A visceral, primal shock of horror ripped through my nervous system and out of pure reactionary intent, I swung. The axe flew like a hurricane as I whipped my shoulder towards the side of the voice’s origin. A boom echoed out in a split second cacophony of sound as the blade crashed into the wooden frame of my bed, leaving my grip. In the chaos something scittered away, crashing through my bedroom door’s reinforcements. The bells echoed out. The moment was deafening. I saw nothing in the shroud of night, but I heard it all, I heard it leave.
	I jumped up, adrenaline expelling all exhaustion out of me, and ran downstairs. The front door’s barricade was thrown apart and the door wide open. It was just me now. In the silence I was sure. Though, I had been sure before, and when I ascended those steps and entered my room to retrieve the axe, I noticed the storage space in the wall was slightly ajar. A small note on the floor nearby.
Bear witness to my love  
	Looking inside, I of course saw what I feared. Reeking of piss and shit, the space contained empty cans and a scrunched up blanket.
	I ran. I ran with everything I had. I began down the road. In delirium I ended up careening through the woods. Tumbling over rock and brush I felt the blood in my head thin. The taste of iron overwhelmed me as I heaved. Where was I running to? Would I ever stop? Or would I just die here instead? After endless woods, it just kept going and going and going. So I collapsed. I spent my last few seconds of consciousness sitting against a mighty tree. Weak and helpless. As my eyes shut, the leaves to my right crunched. A gentle, wet kiss grazed my forehead.

	The brush of wheat on my skin woke me up. I was lying down in a field I knew very well. I did not need to get up to guess. I stretched my fingers to make sure I was alive and as my joints slowly bent, I heard quiet crackling. I looked down upon myself to see what had become of me. I was completely naked and covered entirely with dried blood. Injuryless, I assumed it was not my own. Brush stroke patterns could be seen in my coating, and the layer was equal across every inch of my skin, suggesting it had been applied carefully by someone. But of course I knew who did it.
	In my sleep induced, dream-like hysteria, I stood up slowly, feeling as though I was gently floating to my feet. 
	And I saw it.
	In the night a great flame bellowed from the center of the field. An intentional circle had been lit in the crop, a small opening in the fire facing me, inviting me in. 
	But in the center, in the center he stood.
	Like a beacon flaring up from the earth to reach something greater in the sky, he stood. On an enormous cross, towering ten feet above me, he had been crucified. Cut apart into hundreds of mangled, bloodied pieces and reassembled into a horrific imitation of the human form. Blood flowed out as each piece pressed against another to flow like a river down the cross. But it wasn’t just him on this obelisk of human meat offering. No, the form was much too large. I could tell there were others mixed into the construction. But the worst part…his eyes. The only eyes in that nailed together, mess of a face. Impossibly wide they glared down at me, pupils small and judgmental. To this day, I am unsure if I imagined them following me, or if they actually did. In that moment of terror it felt as though I was at the center of everything. The air was thick and the sky rumbled. Did the clouds shift into form or did I imagine it? In every possible sense, I felt I was being watched.
	So I ran.
	Through my unbearable sickness, vomiting on myself as I went, I turned and ran to the woods. I looked at the house for the final time. It was engulfed in flames. 
	I don’t know how long I ran. I don’t really know where I ended up. But, eventually, the pines gave way.

	I never thought I would have made it out of the hopeless city, I never thought I could escape that labyrinthine farm property in those woods, I never thought I could ever live without seeing the mangled face of Albert Seamore in a dark corner, in the black behind my eyelids, in the abyss of a loved one’s pupil. But eventually, the pines will give way.
