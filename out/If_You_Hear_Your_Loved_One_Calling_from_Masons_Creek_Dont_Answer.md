If anyone lives near Mason’s Creek, please never go near the water.



Jason’s wife died two months ago. At the funeral, he was the saddest I’ve seen him.



I was surprised when he asked about going on a kayaking trip.



He said that he just needed a distraction and a breath of fresh air.



He arrived early on Sunday morning.



When I looked at him, his eyes were red like he hadn’t slept for days.



“Are you ready to explore Mason’s Creek today?”



“I’m a little wary. You know what people say about that place.”



“Come on, man, it’s only stories. You worry too much.”



We barely talked through the ride. He wore an unnaturally wide grin.



“Sally always wanted to go to Mason’s Creek,” Jason mumbled. 



I doubt that was true. His wife was very superstitious. The legends of that place would scare her off.



People would often drown in Mason’s Creek, but their bodies would never surface. Folks around that area said that a demon lured men under the current and took their souls.



The river was about two miles from the parking lot. The path to it was overgrown with tall grass and bushes on the sides. It seemed like no one had been here for a while.



From afar, tall pine trees grew on the riverbank, towering about a hundred feet, looking down at the stream beneath them.



As we walked through the path, Jason told me he’d been dreaming of Sally since her funeral.



It was a part of grief that I understood.



The river was about twenty feet across. It was muddy, but very gentle.



The weather was cloudy. A mild fog started setting in. It felt heavier than usual. I could feel it seeping into my skin.



I heard a faint, soft, feminine laugh…

  


Small islands overgrown with brush slowly emerged from the fog. At first, I saw shapes running through the twigs, but as we got closer, they disappeared.



As we moved farther along, the fog grew denser. It was getting harder to see. The river had intensified. Small waves were rocking my kayak back and forth.



The air had a strange odor of dirt and decay.



I had to slow down, only seeing a silhouette of Jason until he completely disappeared into the fog.



Then I heard strange sounds carried by the wind. They were soft and soothing, almost like a beautiful woman speaking.



“Sally!” I heard Jason yell out.



I stopped. The waves were slowly rocking my kayak forward. I heard the soft sound of someone speaking again.



It was Jason’s wife's voice. The paddle started trembling in my hands. I saw her body in the coffin. How could she be speaking to Jason now?



Then his silhouette appeared. He was leaning over his kayak, looking down into the water, talking into it softly.



He was hypnotized by whatever he saw beneath the water.



“I missed you, my love,” Jason said.



“I miss you too! Come closer, my love, so I can kiss you again.” 



He leaned over. Out of the water came the naked upper body of his wife. Her hair was long and golden, her skin smooth with no wrinkles. 



When she died, she was in her 70s; now she looked like she was 20 again.



She touched Jason's face and leaned in for a kiss, but as their lips met, her body changed.



Her hands were now mostly bones with pieces of rotting flesh hanging on them. The hair was thin and gray, almost turning white. Her eyeballs swung loosely out of the eye socket, barely holding on by a single tendon.



The air was now filled with a smell of rotting meat. The waves intensified.



Jason tried to scream and pull away, but the thing started pulling him back.



A shockwave ran through my body. My heart was pounding so hard I could barely breathe.



The thing let out a blood-curdling scream as it dragged Jason’s body underwater.



Jason managed to resurface again. His hands were waving in panic. A look of pure terror and pain was in his eyes. I thought he screamed out my name.



The thing resurfaced, taking him back under. Its body was flashing back and forth between the monster and his wife.



Then only bubbles, and the river became calm again.



Tears were rolling down my face. My only friend was lost. I wasn’t consumed by fear as much as I was by sadness.



Then the river started moving again. I heard the faint whisper coming through the fog. Left of my kayak, the face of my wife, whom I lost 10 years ago, appeared. 



I haven’t seen her since the accident.



She looked as gorgeous as the day I met her. She started saying how much she missed me, and how we could be back together if I just got off my kayak.



I almost leaned over until I realized what these things did to Jason. I started paddling away.



The current fought me. The fog intensified, and water was splashing into my face.



I heard my wife’s voice get closer. Then something grabbed onto my kayak and started pulling me back.



I started paddling as hard as my body let me. Finally, I felt the grip relax, and I managed to get to the bank.



As soon as I got out, the river went quiet, and the air cleared.



I ran back to the parking lot. Panting, I leaned on Jason’s truck.



There is a wet handprint on the truck. The fingers are too long to be human.



The fog is rolling in again.



Something wet is moving through the woods.



And my wife’s calling my name.



*She’s not alone.*
