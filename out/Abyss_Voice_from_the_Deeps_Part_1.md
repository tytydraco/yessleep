*Archaeology*, *why would anyone in their right mind choose to do a PhD in archaeology?*

I sighed for what seemed like the hundredth time as I looked out the train window at the grey, flat, bleak landscape outside, my head swaying slightly against the rain-lashed glass as the carriage gently rocked side to side. I had been travelling for over five hours from Durham, and the time had allowed me another painful session of introspection at just what in God’s name I thought I was doing with my life.

It was a stupid, foolish decision that had marred my best years of youth with the weight of things long dead. I was twenty-eight, nowhere near the end of my life, but it sure as hell felt like it as I thought back on the events that led me to taking a train ride across the length of the country to some forsaken seaside town in the southeast of England. I had squandered years of parties, nights out and untold fun by choosing to do a Bachelor’s in Classics at Oxford. My parents had been so proud the day I got into one of the most prestigious universities in the world, completely overlooking the fact that their son had chosen a degree that would lead him to literally nowhere.

My first years at university were not what I had envisioned. In the Classics department, there were no parties or events or mixers, or anything of the sort. The type of people who chose Classics were already old by the time they reached adulthood, living fossils hidden by their youthful exterior. I made few friends, barely acquaintances now, ten years later. I had resolved to change my luck by applying for a Master’s degree at Cambridge, but my poor decision-making skills had once again led me down a path of little reward. I had decided to study at the Faculty of Divinity, an overly lofty name for a school that specialised in taking the more interesting aspects of (primarily Christian) religion and poisoning it with academic misery. I learned a lot, sure, but to what end? I wasn’t even religious myself, despite my mother being a devout Church of England follower. I got that from my dad, for sure. He was a man of logic and rational thought, no doubt it’s what led him to become a family doctor at a clinic in my hometown of Leeds. He hadn’t reacted well to my choice to go to Cambridge. For days after I had told him, he’d lecture me on trying to find something useful to study or to maybe even retrain and do another Bachelor’s in something like Economics or Law. You know, *real* subjects. Yet something in me made me stick to my decision out of spite, leading me to where I am now: on a train, going to a lonely town on the very tip of the country.

I hadn’t wanted to go into archaeology at first, not until I had met Professor Stewart Landry. He was a giant in the field, intelligent, surprisingly charismatic, and seemed to be genuinely passionate about uncovering the secrets of the past. He was very much one of those people who believed that the past could teach us about where we were going in the future, as a society. I hate to say it, but at the time, I believed him. And so, against yet more protesting from my father, I applied for the PhD programme in Durham. I had been assigned to Professor Landry’s research party as soon as I joined, specialising in both pre-Christian Britain and Anglo-Saxon faith. With my background in Cambridge, he said that I’d be a perfect fit for his team. I use the word *team* very generously here. It was myself and one other student called Mitchell, who I can honestly say is the very vision of what I never wanted to become as a man. Skinny, devoid of any character besides his work, and kind of rat-like.

I had resolved not long after joining that I would be leaving the programme, but all those plans had been put on hold the day I received an email from Prof. Landry last week, detailing an urgent summons to the small town of Whitport on the Kent coast. I stopped staring out the window and opened my laptop, scanning over the email again for any small details I needed to remember. If we had missed anything, it was too late to turn back now.

*Hello Matthew,*

*Hope you had a pleasant Easter break. Do anything nice? I won’t beat around the bush, something very exciting is in the works. I’m sure you may have heard about the unfortunate cliff collapse in Whitport that happened over the weekend, just terrible stuff. What’s interesting is that I received an email from one Ms. Margaret Wright of the Whitport Historical Society the day after it happened. It turns out, they found something in the collapse that might be of great interest to us. Apparently, the old chapel of St. Mary was heavily damaged, but Ms. Wright claims that the disaster has unearthed a section of the chapel no one knew existed!*

*She’s asked me to come review the findings, as the chapel dates back to the tenth century. I’m asking for you to accompany me to Whitport next week so we can survey the ruins and see what they’ve found. This would be an amazing opportunity to form the basis of a new thesis for your own studies too, as well as get us out the office for a few days. I’ll head to Whitport ahead of you to meet with the Historical Society on the Wednesday, but if you could bring the bag with the new brushes, trowels, and the small and large photo scales on the Friday, that would be most helpful.*

*I’ve put us up in a B&B on the coast, not far from the collapse site. Don’t worry, the locals assure me that section of the cliff is safe. Shouldn’t take us more than a few days. I’ll send you the accommodation details on WhatsApp when I get the chance.*

*Best regards,*

*Stewart.*

 

And so, here I am, on the fast train to the southeast coast with a duffle bag full of tools and another of my belongings, wishing I was literally anywhere else in the world.

I pulled into Whitport in the early evening. It was still raining when I stepped off onto a sad looking station platform, bracketed by a hideous bridge made from that nasty gravelly stone that seems to have been all the rage in post-war Britain. A couple people stepped off with me, but none of them paid each other heed as they all scurried over to a small gate to the left of the station building leading out to the street. The station was on a small hill, giving me a slightly elevated view of the town that was to be my home for the next few days. Whitport didn’t look as dismal as I expected, but the weather certainly didn’t help to improve the image. From the station I could see two pubs side by side (one of which was creatively named *The Railway Tavern*, top marks for whoever named that one.) I thought about heading into one of them before going to the B&B, but my body groaned and ached from a full day of travel. It’s amazing how tired you can feel when sitting down for ninety percent of your day. There was a tiny taxi office just down from the hill, and so I plodded towards it, making sure to keep the bag with the equipment secure on my shoulder. The office was poorly lit and spartan on the inside, with a pair of moth-eaten chairs in front of a simple desk. The man behind it looked like he had died back in the nineties yet stubbornly refused to give in to the grave. He was short, fat and balding. Exactly the type of person I expected to find in a place like this. When he spoke, it was like the final breath of ten thousand spent cigarettes wheezing as one.

“Evenin’, what can I do ya for?”

“Um, I’m looking to get a cab to the uhh…” I checked my WhatsApp messages from Stewart. “To the Beach House B&B on uh, Priory Road?”

“Ah yeah. Gotcha mate,” he turned to a room in the back and yelled so loud and suddenly I jumped. “Oi Gary! Punter ‘ere for ya!” A skinny man with skin as sallow and yellowed as the wallpaper came out in a shirt stained with God knows what.

“Yeah, come with me, mate. Where you ‘eadin’?”

The taxi drive wasn’t long at all, and I realised I could have easily walked the route myself. Gary, my illustrious chauffeur, was sadly, a talker. While the drive was scarcely ten minutes, he had somehow managed to say more words than all Dickens novels combined in that time, going on about where I’m from, what brought me to Whitport, along with more than a few veiled comments about me being a “posh toff” for going to Oxbridge. I responded with the bare minimum. Looking back, I could have asked him about the collapse, was he there when it happened, was anyone hurt etc. But I just couldn’t be bothered to even attempt to muster the level of interest or courtesy to ask.

The B&B was grander than I expected. A great big Victorian house down a quiet road with a sea view. As Gary drove off, I looked up at the end of the street. Where I would normally see the sea during the day, at night there was only a vast expanse of black out into the beyond. It was strangely intimidating, made all the more so by the single streetlight that sputtered at the end of the road. I turned away and made my way up the steps to the house, noting the quaint little sign showing a faded image of a blue beach hut. The air smelled of salt and something else unidentifiable. I wrinkled my nose as I took it in, a pungent sour scent that felt like a mix of overripe fruit and something pickled. I knocked twice and rang the bell, readjusting my bags and taking in the details of the large front door. It was definitely Victorian, with red and green stained glass bordering the chipped painted white door. It opened, flooding a warm light out onto the doorstep and myself, where a short, almost spherical woman greeted me.

“Oh, you must be the professor’s boy! Come in, come in, I’m Judy Carter, let me help you with your bags.”

“Oh no, that’s not–”

“My husband Brian is in the living room with your professor.” She’d already picked up the duffle with my belongings before I could say another word. “He’s very clever that man. The professor, not my husband,” she laughed before I even registered what she’d said. “All over our heads, I’m afraid. I’m not one for all that smart talk. Where is it you’ve come from again?” Her cheeks were red and rosy, and her voice clearly showed that she had burned through several packs of cigarettes a day back in her youth.

“Durham.” I replied, stepping inside the warm, surprisingly spacious hallway. It really was a beautiful house, with authentic diamond tiles on the floor and original fixtures on the doorframes and staircase. The sour salty air outside had been replaced by the smell of tea and something smoky. The central heating seemed to be on full blast, making me feel almost dizzy as the cold rain on my shoulders evaporated off in an instant.

“Oh, that’s a long way. Had an aunt up that way in Middlesbrough. Your room is on the first floor, end of the hall. Bathroom is straight ahead at the top of the stairs. Me and Brian are on the top floor to the left. Just give us a shout if you need anything.”

“Thank you,” I said as I followed Judy to where I’d be staying. The room was small but very cosy, facing the street below with the yawning blackness of the sea to the left. The room was decorated with a litany of cliched seaside memorabilia, seashells, a model boat, paintings of seagulls. It was so tailored to out-of-towners I half expected a *Live, Laugh, Love* placard hanging above my bed. “I’ll head downstairs in a minute.”

Judy shuffled off, leaving me to unpack. For a moment I just sat there on the bed looking out into the rainy night beyond. A streetlight stood directly outside the house, giving me a clear view of the shadowed streets as they glistened in the artificial glow. It was a little eerie, I thought, how everything beyond the circle of light seemed to melt away into darkness. I could barely make out the pointed shapes of the neighbouring houses, which seemed strange. It wasn’t until after I turned to unpack that I realised that not one of the other homes in the street had any lights on. I don’t know why, but that realisation compelled me to shut the curtains immediately.

I came downstairs to find the door to the living room was ajar, warm yellow light spilling into the hallway like butter over toast. I hovered for a moment, unsure if I should knock or just walk in. Judy hadn’t said whether I should make myself known or wait to be summoned like some Victorian butler. But then I heard Stewart’s laugh—deep and rich and maddeningly confident—and decided I was too tired to be awkward.

“Ah, there he is!” Professor Landry exclaimed the moment I stepped inside, as though he’d conjured me with his voice. He was sitting in a high-backed armchair that looked like it had never once left this room, a cup of tea in one hand and a biscuit perched daintily on the saucer. The other occupant, presumably Brian, gave me a small nod from the sofa. He had the look of a man who had retired ten years ago and hadn’t changed his jumper since.

“Long trip?” Stewart asked, and I just nodded, too tired to complain again. “Sit down, sit down. Have a biscuit. Judy’s homemade. Dangerous things, mind you—eat three and your blood sugar spikes to medieval levels.”

I sat down, and the armchair sighed under my weight. It was ludicrously comfortable, and for a brief moment I considered falling asleep right there in front of them.

“So,” I said, more to keep myself conscious than anything else, “what’s this amazing discovery? Or are you going to make me wait until morning like some kind of academic sadist?”

Stewart grinned. “Straight to the point. I like it. Well, I won’t give you everything just yet—consider it a little incentive to not bail on me and head back to Durham. But yes, it’s genuine. Margaret was right. The collapse exposed a lower crypt beneath the chapel, sealed off by rubble and soil for… well, we’re still dating it, but likely since the High Middle Ages. Maybe earlier. Romanesque stonework. Anglo-Saxon patterns on some of the capitals. And something else.”

The way he said that last bit made me look up. “Something else?”

He leaned forward, lowering his voice like he was telling me a dirty secret. “An object. A kind of… disc. Stone, about three feet wide. Set into the floor. Black glass at the centre. Very old. Very strange.”

My skin prickled. Not from excitement, but from that ancient little voice in the back of my head that occasionally warns you when something’s off. The kind of thing that tells you not to go into the dark room, even if the light switch is right there.

“That’s all I’m saying tonight,” he added, smug as anything. “We’ll go see it tomorrow morning. Site’s been sealed up for the night, and Margaret has the keys. You’ll meet her too. She’s quite the character.”

I didn’t press. I knew that look in his eyes. He was enjoying this too much to spoil the game. So I took a biscuit and let the taste of lemon and ginger pull me back into the room, pretending—for the moment—that I wasn’t suddenly aware of how very far from home I was. I retired to my room as midnight approached. There was only so much of Stewart’s overenthusiasm I could take in an evening. The room creaked softly as I moved. *Old timber bones*, I told myself nothing sinister. But I found myself glancing toward the curtains more than once, wondering if I’d imagined that strange darkness outside. The absence of light in the other houses. The stillness.

Maybe it was just the rain.

 

My arrival into the next morning was heralded by the sharp, needle-like tone of my alarm. I groaned as I turned it off, glancing at the time. 5:30. It was still dark outside. The effort to force myself to the bathroom to shower would have put Hercules to shame, but I managed to bring myself beneath the warm water, washing the cobwebs of the previous night away. Stewart was already downstairs in the kitchen when I descended, chatting in that annoyingly chipper way of his to Judy, who was busying herself at the stove over a pan of bacon and eggs. The smell seemed to revive me fully, and I must admit, the breakfast was very pleasant indeed. I had barely touched my coffee to my lips when Stewart dived right into the business of the day.

“So, Matthew. We’ve been granted access to the collapse site until midday. Margaret said she’ll meet us there at 6:30, so finish up quickly and grab the tool bag. It’s going to be an exciting morning!”

“Why only till midday?” I asked as I forced down the mug of bitter instant coffee.

“Well, they need the time for cleanup. The emergency services still need to stabilise the surrounding buildings and to carry on getting the rubble out. We won’t be alone, though. Margaret and the rest of the Historical Society will be there to help with cataloguing and note taking. They’ve even given us a shovel.”

“Lucky us.”

He hadn’t noticed the sarcasm in my voice, or had at least chosen to ignore it. “Now, I’d best get my supplies. Don’t dawdle, lad.”

We left soon afterwards, the first signs of the sun straining above the overcast horizon. In the daylight, the street didn’t look nearly as creepy—just quiet, like it was holding its breath. The houses here were a mix of the old Victorian dwellings like the Carters’, as well as more modern red-brick terraces built during the Sixties and Seventies, but everything still seemed so grey. We took the most direct route to the collapse, along the clifftop promenade at the end of the road to the right, the colourless sea to our left. I looked over the railings, spying an empty beach strewn with dark seaweed far out across the flats.

“Low tide by the look of it,” Stewart said, almost reading my mind. “Good thing too, makes our job much easier without the sea coming in.” Seagulls moaned and called out across the windy air, the breeze carrying with it that same sour-salty scent I had noticed the night before. Despite the grey streets and Stewart’s endless chatter, I couldn’t shake the weight in my stomach. Excitement? Dread? Maybe just the coffee.

As we approached the seafront, I noticed how the buildings seemed to get much older. Nearly everything here was from the mid-Victorian era by the look of them: painted white and once-bright colours that had been faded to pastels by the sea air over many years. Peeling paint, blank windows, and water-stained signs gave each one the look of a forgotten relic from a colder, wetter decade. One of the most distinctive features, however, were the remains of what looked like more modern structures sticking out of the ocean like the bones of a long dead monster. Thanks to the low tide, I saw the remains of a modern road that ran into the sea, no doubt reclaimed over years of climate change and other such calamities. We passed a rundown looking old fashioned arcade, the type of place where kids in the Nineties and early 2000s would spend their days before the true age of the Internet began. Unbelievably, it still looked to be operating. *Maybe the Internet hasn’t reached Whitport yet.*

We turned up a steep hill away from the half-submerged road, arriving at a trio of pubs that straddled a small junction, each more decrepit looking than the last: *The Narwhal, Triton’s Cove* and the *King James*. The road followed up to a large church hall to our right, made entirely out of flint, and to our left, the reason why we were here. I had never seen a disaster site before, but this was beyond anything I expected. Just passed the *King James*, several roadblocks had been erected in front of a large police van, parked across the width of the street. Despite the early hour, the entire junction was thick with people. Police officers, fire fighters, town officials, and no doubt the Historical Society, were all crawling in front of the police van, around twenty in all. I stumbled my way awkwardly through the crowd as I followed Stewart, careful not to nudge anyone with my duffle as I watched him raise a hand to a short woman in a bright parka coat who seemed oddly cheerful for someone standing at the edge of a crater

“Margaret! Pleasure to see you again!”

“Professor Landry! Pleasure’s all mine! Come, come.” The pair shook hands as Margaret led him over to a small pop-up table covered in notes and files. As I approached, I got my first glimpse of the scale of the disaster. Peering behind the police van, I saw that the black tarmac was cracked and buckled in such a way that the surface rippled like waves frozen mid-motion. Looking up, I saw the striking image of the front of St Mary’s Chapel still standing, now nothing but a flint façade against a cloudy, uncaring sky. The roof had disappeared, leaving a bare window hole overlooking the torn road. I couldn’t see the pit from where I was, and my curiosity was interrupted by Stewart’s voice ringing in my ears.

“Ms. Wright, allow me to introduce Matthew Rhodes, one of my finest students and assistants. He’ll be helping me with my research whilst I’m here, so I’m sure you’ll get well acquainted.”

I had to look downwards to meet Margaret’s gaze, her big brown eyes blinked behind a thick pair of glasses. She must have been in her sixties at least, and her wild frizzy hair had been tamed with a makeshift ponytail.

“Absolute pleasure to meet you Matthew! I’m Margaret, head of the Whitport Historical Society, but you can call me Maggie if it suits.” She shook my hand with surprising firmness. I kind of stammered in response, not really saying any real words. Her big eyes looked me up and down, making me feel a tad uncomfortable. While I didn’t mind female attention, there was something so off-putting about it coming from someone old enough to be my mother. I cleared my throat and started over.

“Pleased to meet you, uh, Maggie.”

“Oh, he’s a handsome one isn’t he?” she remarked, her voice carrying into the air with a little too much emphasis. I shifted uncomfortably, my stomach churning with embarrassment. She seemed completely unaware of my discomfort, a trait I was quickly becoming familiar with. “Come now, I was just telling Professor Landry about what we’ve detailed so far. We weren’t able to get access to the site until yesterday, so there isn’t much to go on I’m afraid.”

Despite Maggie’s comment, there were a copious amount of notes and papers detailing the Historical Society’s findings, along with a plethora of photographs, both polaroid and those open on a laptop that sat at the head of the table. As I set the bag of supplies down, my initial discomfort slowly ebbed away, replaced by growing curiosity. I wasn’t able to make out much of Maggie’s chicken-scratch handwriting, but the photos were most intriguing to me. There were over forty in total, but those focusing on the structural features of this ‘hidden vault’ caught my attention immediately. Stewart had been right; the stonework was definitely reminiscent of other Romanesque churches across the world. The pillars, although aged and in terrible condition, were similar to the spiralling coiled designs of the cloister of the Lateran Basilica in Rome, yet they seemed to have a number of embellishments that I didn’t recognise. They looked almost… organic. The way the carvings spiralled, as if the stone had grown rather than been carved, gave them an eerie, tentacular appearance. They seemed to mimic the form of deep-sea creatures – an octopus, perhaps?

The arches seemed to be made from the same flint as the chapel exterior, apparently quite common for churches in and around Whitport. But the pillar capitals seemed to be made of a strange, glossy black stone that I didn’t recognise, carved with undoubtedly Anglo-Saxon motifs. They were faded, but the camera had been able to make out some fine details of what looked like holy figures standing in a line or a procession, their forms worn but still oddly dignified. One of them, barely distinguishable, seemed to carry a staff topped with something like a flame—or perhaps a wing. Despite my conscious misgivings about my career path, I couldn’t deny how deeply this fascinated me. There was something here—something buried and forgotten. And maybe, just maybe, worth the debt and disillusionment.

“Interesting, really interesting” I said, turning to Maggie and Stewart as if to reassure them that I *did*, in fact, want to be there in some capacity.

“That it is, for sure.” Stewart remarked, a wide grin bursting beneath his moustache. “But that’s not the best part. Have a look at this.” He uncovered a set of five polaroids from the piles and set them before me.

This was undoubtedly what he had mentioned last night. As I scanned the images, my eyes were met with what looked to be a large circular design etched into the broken floor of the vault, now exposed to the open air. The stone was comparatively clear to the rest of the ruins, with the carvings upon the surface much clearer and easier to identify. The ring of stone was around a metre wide, as Stewart had said, etched with writing in both Latin and what I guessed to be Old English, below which were carving of the same holy figures as on the pillars. Their garb suggested them to be monks of some kind, their hands raised in prayer save for the figure at the head of the line, who held a tall staff topped with flame, like a great torch. At the centre of the disc, there was a large black stone, broken almost perfectly in half by the great crack that cleaved the disc in two.

“This is the glass you mentioned?” I asked, pointing to the last image.

“Exactly, my boy. At least, we think it’s glass. We haven’t removed anything from the site yet for analysis. Which,” he hefted his supply bag with a satisfied grunt, “is why we’re here. Let’s go, time’s a-wasting.”
