[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15k9prz/i_work_in_a_clinic_for_fae_the_rules_we_follow/)

I mentioned before that every section of the Specialty Clinic has its own subset of rules.

&#x200B;

Most of them are pretty straightforward. Mau in 0-4 are to wear a tracking bracelet at all times, to ensure that they can’t cause trouble using their illusions. Staff are required to wear proper eyewear while in 0-2, to avoid being hypnotized by Sirens and staff are not permitted to disrupt Karah blood rituals in 0-1 so long as they are being performed in the designated areas. It’s generally pretty straightforward stuff that’s generally only there as a precaution. Even if you slip up, the management is often willing to let it slide and either look the other way or let you off with a slap on the wrist, depending on the patient. Most Sirens aren’t going to  try to hypnotize or feed on the people treating them, most Mau are going to resist their natural urge to be an asshole when their health is on the line and most members of the staff aren’t going to disturb a dark room full of chanting nearly identical figures.

&#x200B;

The rules in 0-5 on the other hand, are a lot less forgiving. You *do not* violate the rules in 0-5 for *any* reason at *any* time, and the main guidelines are posted just about everywhere to make sure that you *do not* forget them.

&#x200B;

**1: Entry into 0-5 is prohibited without appropriate PPE and authorization from a doctor. Additional PPE may need to be worn in rooms that have patients with more severe conditions.**

&#x200B;

**2: Physical contact with patients in 0-5 is prohibited without proper PPE.**

&#x200B;

**3: PPE can only be removed in the designated staff rooms. It is NOT to be removed while in hallways or in patient rooms, regardless as to whether a patient is present or not. Outside food and drinks are not permitted in the designated staff rooms.**

&#x200B;

**4: If a member of the staff suspects they may have been exposed to a hazardous patient, they MUST undergo a minimum of 48 hours quarantine. Quarantine can be extended at the overseeing doctors discretion based on type of exposure. Failure or refusal to report a possible exposure will be punished harshly.**

&#x200B;

**5: Patients may not be removed from 0-5 without a written discharge notice from one of the doctors on staff. And patients may not leave 0-5 after treatment until they have completed a minimum 48 hour quarantine. Quarantine can be extended at the overseeing doctors discretion.**

&#x200B;

1. **If a patient attempts to leave 0-5 without written notice or quarantine, lethal force may be authorized.**
2. **In an emergency situation, a mass sterilization of 0-5 may be enacted. In the event that such measures are taken, the designated safe zones are the staff rooms and quarantine rooms 501 to 510, although the safeguards to these rooms can be shut off for a total sterilization of 0-5.**

&#x200B;

**6: In the event that a patient from 0-5 violates proper exit procedure, a full quarantine may be enacted. During this time, staff are not permitted to enter or leave until quarantine is lifted. The Administrator may also extend this quarantine to the main hospital if necessary.**

&#x200B;

**7: Patients who succumb to an illness in 0-5 MUST be disposed of in the on site crematorium.**

&#x200B;

The few times I’d ever been in 0-5, I’d needed to wear a gown, shoe covers, a hair cover, a face shield with an underlying facemask and gloves.

&#x200B;

Not wearing them while in quarantine myself felt strange. Everyone I could see going past my door was wearing them as they escorted the new Code Lime patients to their own rooms. And from what I could tell, there were a *lot* of Code Lime patients.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

“Sylvia, what exactly is Code Lime?”

&#x200B;

I could hear Dr. Meehan sigh on the other end of the phone. She sounded more exhausted than frustrated as if she hadn’t slept.

&#x200B;

It had been about 5 hours since we’d been put in quarantine. I sat quietly at my small desk in my quarantine room, drinking a coffee that one of my colleagues had brought me with dinner. They’d also been kind enough to pass Dr. Meehan’s phone number along to me as well. I had some questions for her.

&#x200B;

*“It’s an extreme biohazard,”* She replied, almost plainly. *“It means that there is something in the clinic that demands every possible precaution be taken. A Code Lime patient needs to be sent directly to 0-5 for quarantine.”*

“So those worms we saw coming out of Artie… how dangerous are they”

&#x200B;

*“Exceedingly,”* She replied, *“Fortunately our chance of infection was low. But it’s better to be safe than sorry in these circumstances. Those other Code Lime calls we’ve been getting… odds are they’re the same condition.”*

“If we were infected… what exactly would the next steps me?” I asked, a little anxiously.

*“Do you think you’re infected, Currie?”*

“No, I just… I want to know what we’re up against here.”

She seemed suspicious for a moment, before finally answering my question.

&#x200B;

*“You would die. A Gutworm infestation has a mortality rate of one hundred percent. Gestation occurs quickly, between 12 to 24 hours after the eggs are ingested, with symptoms appearing near the end of that timeframe. Vomiting, diarrhea are the most common ones, being triggered as the worms eat away at the host. And following that, death can occur at any time between 48 hours and five days following the initial infection. The exact timeframe is heavily determined by external factors. Host stress, the environment the host is in, host nutrition and whether or not the host is capable of spreading eggs without the worms needing to leave. I’ve even heard of cases where hosts carried the worms around for even longer but inevitably… well… you’ve seen what happens.”*

&#x200B;

My stomach turned as I remembered watching Artie’s body split open as the worms spilled out of him.

&#x200B;

*“I’ve heard a theory stating that they originally evolved to prey on Mermaids and Sirens, although really they can infect anyone. They incubate in the intestines and lay eggs, some of which they pass on to other hosts via sexual contact. When the worms reach maturity and can no longer remain comfortably in the host, they eat their way out of the entrails. In a normal case they’d do this while either close to or in water, since they can’t live very long outside of a host and can’t travel very far outside of water. Although as I said, they can infect just about anyone…”*

&#x200B;

“Jesus…” I said under my breath.

“*Indeed. My understanding was that they’re increasingly rare these days. Partially on account of better water treatment methods killing their eggs before they can find a host, and partially on account of the Siren communities efforts to manage them.”*

“Would they have a cure?” I asked hopefully.

*“I wouldn’t call it a cure, no. Traditionally they killed and burned their infected to prevent them from spreading the parasite. That’s the only way that ever proved effective.”*

&#x200B;

I felt my heart sank as I realized what that meant for the patients who were coming in, and Dr. Meehan’s heavy silence on the other end of the line confirmed it.

“So the patients who are coming in now…” I said softly.

*“We aren’t going to be able to help them. All we’ll be able to do is watch them die.”* She said in the same calm, clinical tone she seemed to say everything else in. *“Right now, the priority needs to be containing those who have been exposed. Quarantining the ones who don’t show symptoms, and isolating the ones that do. To that end, I’ve already spoken with the Administrator and they’ve notified the Imperium. With any luck, they might just be able to find the source of the infection. From what I’ve been told, currently we’ve gotten around 34 Code Lime patients… and that number is expected to grow considerably within the next several hours.”*

&#x200B;

34 and counting…

&#x200B;

34 people in this wing with us, that we couldn’t help.

&#x200B;

There’s an acronym I’ve heard during the years that I’ve spent working in a hospital. AMYOYO.

&#x200B;

It stands for: ‘*Alright Motherfucker, You’re On Your Own*.’

&#x200B;

Typically it only gets used when a patient arrives in a state there’s no coming back from. A severe injury or a disease that’s progressed too far to treat.

&#x200B;

I never really liked that phrase.

&#x200B;

Maybe I’m just an idealist, but I want to believe that there’s at least *something* you can do for everyone. Even if you can’t save them, you can at least make their final hours a little less miserable.

&#x200B;

The absolute terror on Artie’s face as the worms chewed through him was still burned into my memory. The way he panicked, knowing he was going to die and desperately trying to fight off the inevitable… I couldn’t forget it.

&#x200B;

The idea of every single one of our patients suffering the same horrible fate didn’t sit well with me.

&#x200B;

Not one bit.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I didn’t sleep much that night. More Code Lime’s came in through the evening. Far more than I was able to count. Breakfast arrived sometime around 9 AM the next morning, about 14 hours after I’d been put in quarantine. I recognized the nurse bringing it to me behind all the PPE, a Karah by the name of Sasha Peters.

&#x200B;

I’d always liked Sasha. Karah aren’t really the most social fae out there (or at least they aren’t social with anyone who isn’t a Karah) but Sasha was one of the exceptions. Like most Karah, she had a slight build, stringy black hair, pale skin and large green eyes, although she usually wore it in a ponytail for practical purposes.

&#x200B;

She was also a little taller than most Karah I’d met, although not by much. She was 5’3, which was tall by Karah standards. Most of them only hit 5’0. I always figured that their short height was part of the reason that people equated them with goblins, elves and other miscellaneous creatures of myth. Tp be fair, they’d probably helped inspire those creatures, although physically they really weren’t that much different than people. There was obviously something *different* about them but it wasn’t immediately obvious.

&#x200B;

“Holding up alright, Jamie?” Sasha asked. She set my tray on my desk, along with a sealed plastic bag but kept her distance from me otherwise.

“About as well as I can,” I replied. “How’s it going out there?”

“Not well. We’ve had Code Lime cases coming in since last night. A lot of them are human. No word on the source yet.”

“How many?”

“We’re at 51 now.”

&#x200B;

51… Jesus. We’d rarely even had 51 patients in the entire Clinic, let alone in one wing! Where the hell were we putting them?

“I was asked to bring you this as well.”

&#x200B;

She reached for the bag and tossed it onto the bed with me. I opened it, to find a set of clean scrubs and a set of PPE inside.

“I’m still on quarantine, though.” I said, looking back up at her confused.

“You are, but right now we need people. The situation here is already out of hand. As of right now, you’ve only been cleared to work in in 0-5. You, Dr. Meehan and the others who’ve had a risk of exposure won’t be allowed to leave 0-5 until you’ve gone 48 hours without exposure or symptoms.”

&#x200B;

My brow furrowed.

“So does my timer just reset then?” I asked, a little bitterly.

“That’s what it sounded like to me… I’m sorry… I know it’s not a fair deal but…”

&#x200B;

“It’s fine,” I sighed, getting up to go over to the desk. “Can’t say I’m thrilled about it but it beats sitting around here watching the clock. Are you under quarantine?”

“Right now, no,” She replied. “What can I do?”

“If I give you my keys, can you go to my apartment and feed my cat when you get off shift?”

She nodded, and gave me a grim smile.

“Yeah. Happy to.”

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

After breakfast, I got changed and got back to work. To be honest, it was a little bittersweet. Walking through the halls of 0-5 and seeing the state our sudden influx of patients were in broke my heart a little bit. Men, women, children… crammed into hospital rooms that were normally just meant for one person. People from all walks of life, all of them doomed to die. And some of them already dead.

&#x200B;

I could see them being rolled through the halls on bloodstained hospital beds, eyes lifeless and afraid, bellies torn open and sometimes, worms still twisting in their guts as they were wheeled off to the crematorium by nurses in full hazmat gear.

&#x200B;

It had been around 16 hours since Artie had walked through the door and already everything was going to hell.

&#x200B;

I noticed Dr. Meehan at the center of most of it. She was one of the doctors in full hazmat gear, and even her normally cold and clinical voice sounded a little strained.

&#x200B;

“We need to keep the patients in an advanced state in rooms 520 to 525. This has to be a first in, first out system. The *moment* vitals cease, I need the worms dealt with. Use the steam guns to kill them, then get the bodies to the crematorium *immediately.* Remember, *full* hazmat suits, people! We need *full* hazard gear!”

&#x200B;

“What can I do to help?” I asked. She turned to look at me, barely acknowledging me before giving her orders.

“I need more people monitoring the patients in rooms 513 and 514. We’ve been providing doses of morphine to ease the pain, along with an anthelmintic. We need to make sure that patients have recieved theirs.”

“Is the anthelmintic even going to help?” I asked.

&#x200B;

Dr. Meehan gave me a grave look.

“It’s better than nothing,” She finally said.

I nodded, before heading back toward 513 and 514.

&#x200B;

The next several hours passed by in a blur. We had between 3-4 patients per room, although as more and more Code Lime patients came in, that number quickly ballooned up to 6-7.

&#x200B;

I did what I could for them. Providing them with water, morphine and anthelmintic.

&#x200B;

None of it did any good.

&#x200B;

The patients who deteriorated too severely were moved down the hall, closer to the crematorium, and two or three times every hour came the hasty unceremonious removal of a body.

&#x200B;

All of this felt like something out of a nightmare. And yet the fear of all of this had faded far faster than it should have into a stagnant, resignation. There was a dread in the back of my mind that I acknowledged, but the longer it lingered, the less it affected me. It was like having a gun trained on the back of my head the whole time. Sooner or later, it just became a fact of life.

&#x200B;

I didn’t watch the clock. I didn’t know how much time had passed. This wasn’t really a *shift* anymore, nor was it work. This was just my existence.

&#x200B;

By the time I finally shuffled back to the quarantine room I’d been in, at least 18 hours had passed, and I saw two of my colleagues sleeping in my bed, one of them still dressed in their PPE. I didn't wake them. I didn’t even blame them. I just went to the chair by my desk and passed out for a solid four hours before getting up to start working again, and when I did wake up, we’d gone up to ten patients per room.

&#x200B;

I think it goes without saying that we were *beyond* overwhelmed.

&#x200B;

But we kept on working. Kept on trying to handle what was coming at us, even if it felt like we were slowly drowning.

&#x200B;

I think it was around 49 hours after Artie had first shown up that I noticed the first live patient being brought to the crematorium.

&#x200B;

I was sleep deprived, unsure if I was infected or not, and probably a little dehydrated, but I still found myself sprinting through the hall to stop the bed being rolled down the hall.

“What the hell are you doing?” I demanded, “They’re still alive!”

&#x200B;

The quiet figures in the hazmat suit who’d been pushing the bed didn’t give me an answer. The answer came from Dr. Meehan, who came down the hall toward me.

“We have no more room for new patients, Currie. Right now we’re at 258 cases and the situation has not slowed down. We have patients in the hallway right now. We need the room.”

“So you’re just going to throw a living person in the incinerator?!”

“No. We are putting a person who is nearly dead in the crematorium. Look at the state of this patient, Currie. They’ll be dead within the hour.”

&#x200B;

I grimaced. I did look down at the patient. His eyes were closed and his head had fallen slightly to the side. His breathing was heavy. I’d seen this several times before over the past few hours. I knew that there was no saving him… but to just throw him into the fire?

&#x200B;

The two figures in the hazmat suits pushed past me, and I looked over at Dr. Meehan. Behind her, I could see two more figures rolling another bed out of 525. This one was a younger girl… although she was mostly dead already. Her empty eyes stared sightlessly at the ceiling and I could see blood dribbling out of her stomach, where the dying worms were finishing their work.

&#x200B;

“The Administrator has given me authorization to mitigate the number of patients we have.” Dr. Meehan said, “We can’t keep this up, Currie. You know that we can’t. The anthelmintic has done *nothing.* Our morphine supply ran dry 17 hours ago. There are still new patients coming in. I told you before. These people can’t be saved. Right now, we need to do what we *have* to do here.”

&#x200B;

Another bed was being removed from 525. The patient on this one, a Mau, was clearly still alive. They kept trying to get up, trying to move. Trying to escape. But their body wouldn’t help them. I could see half formed shadows appearing in the hall, weak attempts to summon some kind of illusion to save them, but the poor soul didn’t even have the strength for that. Their eyes met mine for a moment, and I looked away from them. I couldn’t watch them, lest their terror spread to me too.

“Go to one of the quarantine rooms and take a rest, Currie,” She said.

&#x200B;

I didn’t reply to her. I just nodded and turned away. Somewhere far behind me, I could hear terrified sobs… followed by silence.

&#x200B;

I made my way back to the quarantine room I’d been staying in. My feet felt like they were made of lead and my eyes were heavy. I needed to sleep.

&#x200B;

I felt weak, battered and worn down completely. I walked into the quarantine room. Sasha was passed out on the bed nearby and another one of the Doctors, LeRoy was sleeping on my desk. He was still fully dressed in his hazard suit and looked like he’d been in the middle of writing something down when sleep had hit him like a brick to the head.

&#x200B;

I could hear a third person showering in the bathroom.

&#x200B;

I pulled off my plastic PPE gown and tossed it in the garbage, before taking off my face shield and mask. I left the rest of my clothes on as I crashed down on the bed beside Sasha. She rolled over, her hair coming undone as she did. I started to drift off almost immediately and was thankful for it.

&#x200B;

Then I heard the sound of retching. The sound of pained, muffled gasps.

&#x200B;

The sound of someone dying.

&#x200B;

And it was coming from the bathroom. I sat up, my heart skipping a beat as I looked over toward the closed bathroom door.

&#x200B;

I heard whoever was inside retch, and I heard fluid spilling on the ground.

&#x200B;

No…

&#x200B;

I was on my feet immediately. Sasha stirred beside me, but didn’t wake up as I ran for the door. Whoever was in there hadn’t locked it and I’m not sure if that was intentional or an oversight. The door flew open, and when I looked inside, I was greeted by everything I’d dreaded right in that moment.

&#x200B;

The woman in the bathroom was Samara. She usually worked in triage, but considering that this was an all hands on deck situation, she’d been brought in to help here. Blood and bile dribbled down her chin. Her eyes had a bloodshot look to them, as she stood over a pool of her own blood flecked vomit.

&#x200B;

I could see the worms writhing around in it. She looked at me, tears streaming down her cheeks as she gripped the sink for support to keep herself from collapsing.

&#x200B;

I’d never seen anyone look so afraid in my entire life before.

*“Please…”* She rasped, *“Jamie… help me…”*

She tried to take a step forward, only to collapse to the ground. She let out a cry of pain, her breathing growing heavier as I watched blood begin to pool out of her stomach.

&#x200B;

She was coming undone.

“Oh my God…”

&#x200B;

Sasha’s voice snapped me out of my trance and I looked to see her standing beside me, a hand pressed to her mouth.

*“Please…”* Samara sobbed, as she pushed herself up onto her hands and knees. Her stomach split with a sickening *sploosh* noise. I saw her eyes widen in knowing terror as her entrails spilled out of her. Her face went a shade paler as the life quickly faded from her eyes. She collapsed, not yet dead… but no longer really alive either.

&#x200B;

The worms twisted and writhed inside of her guts, slithering out of her entrails as her body twitched and convulsed in her final moments.

“Get back!” I said, pushing Sasha away from the door as the worms slithered toward us.

&#x200B;

From the corner of my eye, I noticed that Dr. LeRoy was still asleep in his chair, and reached out to tap him on the shoulder.

“*Huh…”* He sat up, groggy and confused, before noticing the scene in the bathroom. I saw his eyes lock with Samara’s, and heard him cry out in shock. He stumbled back, falling out of his chair and backing himself toward the desk.

“Come on!” I called, as he struggled to stand. Sasha and I were already at the door, and my hand was right beside the small console that would seal and sterilize the room.

&#x200B;

Dr. LeRoy scrambled to his feet, but he was moving too slow. One of the worms had already made a beeline toward him, and I watched it rear back before launching itself at his leg. I’d never seen a worm move like that before, the meter long creature was almost serpentine in the way it writhed toward him, and when it latched on to him, I heard him cry out in pain.

&#x200B;

Even through the hazmat suit, I could see LeRoy’s eyes widening in terror as he frantically tried to bat the worm away. But it wouldn’t budge. It tore through his hazmat suit like it was nothing, burrowing into the flesh of his leg and there wasn’t a damn thing he could do to stop it.

&#x200B;

I closed the door hit the button on the console to sterilize the room, my heart racing as I did. The door locked, and I heard an alarm sound as 300 degree steam filled the room. Dr. LeRoy cried out and covered his face. Through the steam, I watched as some of the worms who had been crawling out of the bathroom writhed violently, their skin sizzling.

&#x200B;

It didn’t take much to kill them.

&#x200B;

Dr. LeRoy extended a leg, as if hoping that the steam would kill the thing digging into his flesh, although by the time the steam faded, about five minutes later, there was no sign of the worms corpse. The door opened again, and I tore it open. The worms in the bathroom were dead, and Dr. LeRoy lay on the ground, his breathing heavy and panicked.

“It’s still in…” He babbled, “It’s still in, it’s still in, IT’S STILL IN ME!”

&#x200B;

I saw him grap as the helmet of his hazard suit and pry it off of him. His hair was soaked with sweat and plastered to his skin and his face was a little red, although he was still mostly in one piece. His suit had probably protected him from the burning steam.

“Cut it out…” He said, looking at Sasha and I with wild, panicked eyes, “CUT IT OUT OF ME!”

“What’s going on in here?”

&#x200B;

I looked back to see Dr. Meehan standing in the doorway, flanked by two nurses in hazmat suits.

“One of the worms got into his suit!” Sasha said, “Samara was infected! We sterilized the room, but it could still be living in him!”

“It… it’s in my leg…” Dr. LeRoy stammered, “We need to cut it out of my leg, *please just cut it out of my leg!”*

&#x200B;

Dr. Meehan stared at him, before looking back toward her nurses.

“Barrett, Marston. Get Dr. LeRoy to the crematorium, immediately.”

“What?” I asked, “Sylvia what the hell are you doing!”

&#x200B;

The two figures in the hazmat suits pushed past me, although I tried to force them off. Sasha tried to do the same, although her luck was just as bad as mine.

“No… NO, NO WAIT! DON’T! SYLVIA WAIT!”

&#x200B;

Dr. LeRoy’s cries fell on deaf ears. The two nurses grabbed him, dragging him to the door and nothing Sasha or I could do stopped them. Dr. Meehan pushed her way into the room with surprising force, grabbing both of us and pulling us away.

&#x200B;

*“He’s already dead!”* She snapped, “And you… how do I know either of you weren’t infected too?”

“We weren’t!” I snapped, “I was right there when Samara died! I saw the worms come out of her! They were nowhere near me!”

“And she was already in the bathroom when I got here!” Sasha said, “She said she was having a shower! As far as I know she’s been in there the whole time!”

“As far as you know…” Dr. Meehan repeated, her voice ice cold.

&#x200B;

She scoffed before pushing past us to take a look in the bathroom, where Samara’s corpse lay silent. Her skin was red from the steam, but the worms she’d spawned lay dead.

“Samara never mentioned being infected… nor did she mention any symptoms…” Dr. Meehan said. She looked back at us. “If she was willing to lie… you might be too.”

“For what *reason!”* I snapped.

“People who are afraid don’t need reason to do what they do, Currie. They simply do.”

&#x200B;

She sighed and shook her head.

“We’ve seen a 37% reduction in new patients over the past four hours and now this… it never ends… I should have known this was going to happen.”

“If we’ve seen a reduction in patients then why are we sending them to the crematorium!” I snapped.

&#x200B;

*“BECAUSE THEY’RE ALREADY DEAD!”* Dr. Meehan cried, her voice far more vicious than my own. *“HAVE NEITHER OF YOU BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO ANYTHING THAT’S HAPPENED IN THE LAST TWO DAYS? EVERY NEW PATIENT WE HAVE GOTTEN, HAS DIED!* ***EVERY ONE OF THEM!*** Do you think I WANT to be doing this? Do you think I WANT to be the one killing our patients? *NO!* But there is *nothing else* that we can do! We cannot treat these people! We cannot save them! We are ***beyond*** capacity right now and therefore we are *useless* to them! The *only thing* we can offer right now is a kinder death!”

“And is that what you’re doing to LeRoy?” I asked coldly.

&#x200B;

“Do you really think you can just *cut* that thing out of him, Currie? I guarantee you’ll kill him in the process!” She said, “What’s kinder, a quick death or a slow one through blood loss, chasing a worm that will be deep in his intestines by now?”

“So you’re just going to kill him outright then? You’re not even going to try?”

“I am going to take the *merciful* option!”

“And how do you know it’s the merciful option?” Sasha chimed in, “How do you know any more about these things than we do?”

*“Because I’ve dealt with them before!”*

&#x200B;

For a moment, all of us fell silent.

“Outbreaks of these things are rare… but they aren’t unheard of. I’ve consulted on them before and in each case, the *only* reliable method to deal with these outbreaks has been to isolate the infected, and stop them from spreading further. I told you before. This is what the Sirens have been doing. This is the only treatment. I wish it wasn’t, I truly, truly wish it wasn’t, and I *admire* your drive to find another way. But I have been down this road before and I *know* where it ends. *This is the only way.*”

&#x200B;

For a moment, all three of us were silent.

&#x200B;

Dr. Meehan’s breathing was heavy. I could see her shaking a little bit, but her dark eyes still burned into mine.

“If we have two members of the staff infected, then it is highly likely that we have more. As of right now, I am enacting a full quarantine of the clinic. Nobody else comes in. Nobody else leaves. Not until the patients stop coming in. Is that understood?”

&#x200B;

Neither Sasha nor I responded. Dr. Meehan quietly turned away from us, leaving us alone in the room, and for a moment, the only sound was the frantic cries of Dr. LeRoy as he was dragged off to his fate.

&#x200B;
