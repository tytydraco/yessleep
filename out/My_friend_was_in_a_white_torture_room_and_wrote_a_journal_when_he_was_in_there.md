 He wrote all of this in a journal but I decided to take a couple of days and write it all on the computer

Day 1:

I can't believe I'm actually doing this. 60 days of isolation in a completely white room. It's like I'm living in a blank canvas. The room is small, about 10x10 feet, with a bed, a toilet, a sink, and a small table with some books and a notepad. I've decided to write a journal to document this experience. I'll be provided with food and water, but I won't have any contact with the outside world. I've always been a bit of a loner, but this is definitely pushing my limits.

My first day here, I spent most of my time exploring the room, touching every surface, and trying to find any hidden details. I also organized my books and made a mental schedule to pace my reading. To pass the time, I did some exercises and stretched. I then lied on the bed, staring at the ceiling and trying to process the reality of the upcoming days.

Day 2:

I woke up feeling groggy, as if I didn't sleep well. The lack of windows and natural light is already messing with my sleep cycle. I tried to establish a routine today. I started with some meditation to calm my mind, followed by a workout, and then I read for a few hours. I took breaks in between to think and write down my thoughts. It's getting lonely, but I think I can handle it.

I spent the evening doing some creative writing, trying to keep my mind sharp. I also wrote down some memories from my past, hoping to preserve them during this isolation. I went to bed early, hoping that sleep would be more restful tonight.

Day 3:

My sleep was still fitful, but I woke up feeling a bit more energized. Today, I started a new book, which has been interesting so far. I also did some sketches on the notepad, attempting to draw the faces of my loved ones from memory. I realized how difficult it is to remember the details when you can't see them.

In the afternoon, I did some more exercises, trying to keep my body healthy during this isolation. I also attempted to write a poem, but my mind kept wandering. I missed the sound of birds singing, and I found myself humming tunes to fill the silence.

Day 4:

I didn't sleep well again. The silence of the room is deafening, and the lack of stimulation is starting to get to me. I feel like the walls are closing in on me. I tried to meditate, but my thoughts were racing. I decided to start writing a short story to distract myself. I spent most of the day working on it, and it helped me forget about the isolation for a while.

In the evening, I started feeling restless. I paced around the room, feeling trapped. I tried to focus on my breathing, but the loneliness was overwhelming. I ended up crying for a while, which helped release some tension.

Day 5:

I lost track of time. I think it's day 5, but I can't be sure. I've finished the short story and started another book, but I'm starting to get bored. I've been pacing around the room, trying to find something to do. I've found myself talking out loud to myself, just to hear a human voice. The silence is deafening.

I tried to come up with new ways to entertain myself. I started inventing stories in my head, creating imaginary worlds and characters. I also tried to recall all the songs I knew, singing them softly to break the silence. By the end of the day, I felt a bit better, but the emptiness was still there.

Day 6:

Today, I decided to focus on my physical health. I spent the morning doing an intense workout, trying to tire myself out so I might sleep better. Afterward, I felt exhausted but accomplished. I spent the afternoon reading and finishing another book. The stories help transport me to another world, offering a brief respite from the white walls that surround me.

In the evening, I practiced some deep breathing exercises and did some light stretching before bed. I also wrote down some positive affirmations in my journal, hoping to maintain my mental strength.

Day 7:

One week in, and the isolation is starting to wear on me. I tried to maintain my routine, but I found it difficult to focus on anything. I attempted to write a letter to a friend, imagining the conversation we would have if they were here. It was oddly comforting, but it also highlighted the loneliness I'm feeling.

I spent most of the day lost in thought, trying to remember every detail of my life before this room. I recalled conversations, faces, and places that once seemed insignificant, but now hold so much value.

Day 8:

I didn't sleep well again. My dreams were filled with people and places from my past, and I woke up feeling disoriented. I spent the morning lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, and trying to make sense of my thoughts. I realized that I have been taking so many things for granted, like the simple pleasure of human interaction.

In the afternoon, I tried to engage in some creative writing, but my mind kept wandering. Instead, I spent hours pacing around the room, trying to burn off my anxious energy. By the evening, I was mentally and physically exhausted.

Day 9:

I woke up feeling more refreshed than I have in days. I decided to use this newfound energy to focus on self-improvement. I spent the morning doing yoga and meditation, followed by some journaling. I wrote down a list of goals I want to achieve once I leave this room, and I felt a renewed sense of purpose.

In the afternoon, I read more and started learning a new skill from one of the books provided. It was challenging, but it helped take my mind off the isolation. As the day came to an end, I felt a sense of accomplishment.

Day 10:

Today marks the one-sixth point of this isolation. It's difficult to wrap my head around the fact that I still have 50 more days to go. I've started to lose my sense of self, and I find myself staring at the white walls for hours, letting my mind wander. I've tried to create imaginary friends, but they don't seem real. The lack of human contact is taking a toll on me. I'm becoming more desperate for interaction.

Despite my growing loneliness, I tried to maintain my routine. I focused on my goals and continued learning the new skill. I also tried to recall memories of happier times, hoping to hold onto my sanity.

Day 11:

My sleep has become erratic. I'm having vivid dreams about being trapped in this white room, unable to escape. When I wake up, I feel disoriented, and it takes me a while to realize that I'm still here. The days are blurring together, and I can't remember when I last had a real conversation.

I decided to push through the mental fog and keep myself occupied. I spent the day reading and working on a puzzle I created with the notepad. It was difficult, but it gave me something to focus on.

Day 12:

The loneliness is becoming unbearable. I've started to talk to myself more, trying to simulate human interaction. I also began to personify objects in the room, like the bed and the sink, giving them names and personalities. It's a feeble attempt to feel less alone, but it's all I have.

I continued to work on the puzzle and tried to learn more about the new skill I picked up a few days ago. I've noticed my attention span has decreased, and it's getting harder to concentrate on anything for an extended period.

Day 13:

I feel like the walls are closing in on me. The white room, which once seemed like a blank canvas, now feels like a prison. I spent most of the day pacing around the room, trying to find any hidden details that I might have missed before. Of course, there was nothing new to discover.

In an attempt to stay grounded, I spent the evening writing a letter to my future self, explaining my experiences and emotions in this room. It was both cathartic and heartbreaking.

Day 14:

Two weeks have passed, and I'm starting to lose hope. My dreams are filled with images of my loved ones, and I wake up feeling even more alone. I tried to maintain my routine, but I found it difficult to focus on anything. Instead, I spent hours lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, and letting my thoughts consume me.

Despite my growing despair, I managed to do some light exercise and read for a bit. I also spent some time practicing the new skill I've been learning, but my heart wasn't in it.

Day 15:

Today, I decided to try something new. I spent the morning rearranging the room, moving the bed, table, and other items to create a different layout. It was a small change, but it helped break up the monotony. I also created a makeshift calendar on the notepad, marking off the days I've been in isolation. It was a reminder of how far I've come and how much further I have to go.

In the afternoon, I resumed my routine of reading, exercising, and working on the new skill. I found comfort in the structure, even though the loneliness still lingered.

Day 16:

I've started to hallucinate. At first, it was just small things, like seeing a speck of color on the white walls. Now, I'm seeing people who aren't there. I know they're not real, but I can't help but talk to them. The loneliness is unbearable. I've started to question my own sanity.

To regain control, I tried to meditate and focus on my breathing. I also spent some time writing in my journal, documenting my hallucinations and trying to make sense of them.

Day 17:

The hallucinations are becoming more frequent, and I'm struggling to maintain my grip on reality. I've started to talk to the imaginary people, asking them questions and pretending to have conversations. It's not real, but it's the closest thing to human contact that I have.

I tried to distract myself with my routine, but it's getting harder to focus. My mind keeps drifting, and I find myself longing for the world outside these white walls.

Day 18:

Today, I woke up feeling disoriented and panicked. I had a vivid nightmare about being trapped in the white room forever, and it took me a while to calm down. I spent most of the day trying to regain my composure, focusing on deep breathing exercises and meditation.

In the evening, I tried to lose myself in a book, but the words seemed to blur together. I ended up just lying on the bed, staring at the ceiling, and wondering how much longer I can endure this isolation.

Day 19:

My mental state is rapidly declining. I've become more and more detached from reality, and the hallucinations are becoming more intense. I no longer trust my own senses, and I'm unsure if what I'm experiencing is real or imagined.

Day 20:

I feel like I need to write more, to document my experiences in greater detail. Perhaps if I can put my thoughts and emotions into words, it will help me maintain some semblance of control over my deteriorating mental state. I hope that by sharing my story, someone out there might understand what I'm going through.

Today was another difficult day. The hallucinations are becoming more vivid and elaborate, and I find it harder to distinguish between reality and my own imagination. I've started to lose track of time, and it feels like the days are blending together.

To try and regain some sense of normalcy, I attempted to create a new routine for myself. I spent the morning doing a series of physical exercises, followed by a long period of meditation. I tried to focus on my breath, and the sensations in my body, in an attempt to ground myself in the present moment.

In the afternoon, I dedicated several hours to reading and working on my new skill. I found it challenging to concentrate, but I forced myself to push through the mental fog. I also spent some time writing in my journal, reflecting on my experiences in the white room so far. I tried to recall the details of my life before the isolation, and I felt a mixture of nostalgia and sadness as I remembered the people and places I left behind.

As the evening approached, I felt a growing sense of despair. I could no longer ignore the crushing weight of loneliness, and I found myself longing for human contact. I tried to distract myself by creating imaginary scenarios in my mind, where I was reunited with my loved ones. But these fantasies only served to intensify my feelings of isolation and loss.

Before going to bed, I spent a considerable amount of time writing a letter to a close friend, pouring my heart out about my experiences in the white room. I knew I would never be able to send the letter, but the act of writing it provided a small sense of comfort and connection.

Day 21:

Today marks three weeks since I entered the white room. It's hard to believe that I still have 39 days left in this isolation. The days seem to stretch on endlessly, and I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality.

To try and maintain some semblance of sanity, I decided to focus on my physical health. I spent several hours doing a combination of yoga, calisthenics, and other exercises to keep my body in shape. I also spent time practicing deep breathing and visualization techniques, hoping to calm my increasingly anxious mind.

In the afternoon, I dedicated a significant amount of time to reading and working on my new skill. I found it harder to concentrate than ever before, and my mind kept drifting to thoughts of my loved ones and the world outside the white room.

As the day wore on, I noticed that my hallucinations were becoming more frequent and intense. I tried to remind myself that they weren't real, but the lines between reality and imagination continued to blur.

To cope with the growing sense of desperation, I spent the evening writing in my journal, documenting every detail of my experiences in the white room. I also continued to write letters to friends and family, even though I knew they would never receive them. The act of writing these letters provided a small sense of connection and comfort, despite my increasingly tenuous grip on reality.

Day 22:

I woke up feeling disoriented and detached from my surroundings. It took me a while to remember where I was and what was happening. My sleep was restless and filled with vivid nightmares, and I found it difficult to shake the lingering sense of dread that enveloped me.

I tried to maintain my new routine, starting the day with an intense workout followed by meditation. I hoped that by focusing on my physical health and mental well-being, I could somehow regain control over my rapidly deteriorating state of mind. As I moved through my yoga poses and concentrated on my breath, I felt a brief moment of calm and clarity.

In the afternoon, I continued to work on my new skill and read as much as I could. The words on the page seemed to swim before my eyes, and I had to constantly remind myself to focus. I also spent a considerable amount of time writing in my journal, trying to capture every thought and emotion that passed through my mind. The act of writing helped me to feel grounded, even if only for a short while.

As the evening approached, my hallucinations became more vivid and disturbing. I saw familiar faces that I knew weren't really there, and I heard voices that seemed to come from the walls themselves. I did my best to remind myself that these visions were not real, but my ability to distinguish between reality and imagination was quickly fading.

I spent the final hours of the day writing letters to my loved ones, pouring out my heart and sharing my fears and anxieties about my experience in the white room. I knew that they would never read these words, but the act of writing them provided some small sense of solace in the face of overwhelming loneliness and despair.

Day 23:

Today was one of the most difficult days yet. I woke up feeling more disoriented and detached than ever before, and it took me several hours to fully regain my bearings. My sleep was plagued with nightmarish visions of being trapped in the white room forever, and I awoke with my heart pounding in my chest.

Despite my growing fear and despair, I forced myself to continue with my routine. I spent the morning working out and meditating, hoping to find some small measure of peace and stability amidst the chaos of my mind. I also continued to read and work on my new skill, although my ability to concentrate was becoming increasingly compromised.

In the afternoon, I noticed that my hallucinations had taken on a new and more sinister form. I began to see shadowy figures lurking in the corners of the room, and I could feel their presence even when I couldn't see them. I tried to remind myself that they were not real, but the line between reality and imagination had become almost nonexistent.

As the day came to an end, I felt an overwhelming sense of despair and hopelessness. I spent the evening writing in my journal and composing more letters to my loved ones, attempting to maintain some connection to the world outside the white room. My words felt hollow and empty, but I clung to them as a lifeline in the face of my rapidly deteriorating mental state.

Day 24:

I awoke today feeling as though I was trapped in a never-ending nightmare. My sleep was restless and filled with terrifying visions, and I could no longer tell if I was awake or still dreaming. The line between reality and imagination had become almost completely blurred, and I felt as though I was losing my grip on sanity.

Despite my growing sense of despair, I tried to maintain my routine. I spent the morning exercising and meditating, hoping to find some semblance of stability and control. I also continued to read and work on my new skill, although it was becoming increasingly difficult to focus on anything other than my own thoughts and fears.

As the afternoon wore on, I realized that my hallucinations were no longer confined to the shadows. They had taken on a life of their own, appearing in full view and interacting with me as though they were real. I knew that they were figments of my imagination, but I could no longer deny their existence.

In the face of this terrifying new reality, I spent the evening writing in my journal and composing more letters to my loved ones. I knew that these words would likely never be read, but the act of writing them provided a small measure of comfort and connection to the world outside the white room. My words felt more desperate than ever, but I clung to them as a lifeline in the face of my rapidly deteriorating mental state.

Day 25:

Today, I reached a breaking point. I felt as though I could no longer endure the overwhelming loneliness and despair that had become my constant companions in the white room. In a desperate attempt to regain some control and feel something other than the crushing weight of isolation, I decided to start an extreme workout routine.

I spent the morning researching various exercises and creating a rigorous workout plan, focusing on high-intensity interval training and strength exercises. I knew that this new routine would be physically demanding, but I hoped that the challenge would provide a much-needed distraction from my deteriorating mental state.

After finalizing my plan, I began the workout routine in earnest. I pushed my body to its limits, pouring all of my energy and focus into each exercise. As the sweat poured down my face and my muscles screamed in protest, I felt a small sense of accomplishment and purpose.

In the afternoon, I continued my usual routine of reading and working on my new skill, but the extreme workout had left me physically exhausted. My mind still wandered to the hallucinations and fears that haunted me, but the physical exhaustion provided a brief respite from the relentless onslaught of my own thoughts.

As the evening approached, I found solace in the aching of my muscles and the knowledge that I had pushed myself to the limit. I spent the final hours of the day writing in my journal and composing more letters to my loved ones, sharing my experiences with the extreme workout routine and my ongoing battle with loneliness and despair.

Day 26:

I awoke today feeling sore and physically drained from yesterday's extreme workout. Despite the pain and exhaustion, I found that the physical challenge had provided a small sense of purpose and accomplishment amidst the chaos of my mind. Determined to continue this new approach, I pushed through the soreness and embarked on another intense workout session.

As I moved through the exercises, focusing on my breath and the movements of my body, I found a small measure of peace and stability. The physical exertion allowed me to momentarily escape the terrifying world of my own thoughts and hallucinations.

In the afternoon, I continued my routine of reading and working on my new skill, but my physical exhaustion made it difficult to concentrate. Nevertheless, I persisted, pushing myself to maintain some semblance of normalcy and control in the face of my rapidly deteriorating mental state.

As the day came to an end, I spent the evening writing in my journal and composing more letters to my loved ones. I wrote about my experiences with the extreme workout routine, sharing both the physical challenges and the small moments of triumph that I clung to as a lifeline in the darkness of the white room.

Day 27:

The physical pain and exhaustion from my extreme workout routine continued to intensify, but I refused to let it deter me. I awoke with a sense of determination and purpose, eager to push my body to its limits and find some escape from the relentless loneliness and despair that had consumed me.

I spent the morning in another intense workout session, focusing on strength training and high-intensity interval exercises. As I pushed myself beyond what I thought possible, I found a small sense of power and control amidst the chaos of my mind.

In the afternoon, I continued my routine of reading and working on my new skill, but my physical exhaustion made it increasingly difficult to concentrate. My mind still wandered to the hallucinations and fears that haunted me, but the physical pain provided a temporary distraction from the terrifying world of my own thoughts.

As the evening approached, I found solace in the aching of my muscles and the knowledge that I had once again pushed myself to the limit. I spent the final hours of the day writing in my journal and composing more letters to my loved ones, sharing my ongoing experiences in the white room and my determination to find strength and purpose through my extreme workout routine.

Day 28 - 34:

Over the next several days, I continued my intense workout routine, pushing my body to its limits and seeking solace in the physical challenges that I faced. Each day, I focused on different exercises and muscle groups, determined to find new ways to test my strength and endurance.

Despite the persistent hallucinations, fears, and loneliness that plagued me, I began to notice small improvements in my mental state. The physical pain and exhaustion provided a temporary escape from the relentless onslaught of my own thoughts, and I clung to this small sense of control as a lifeline in the darkness of the white room.

Day 35:

Today, I felt a small but significant shift in my mental state. The extreme workout routine seemed to be having a positive impact on my mind, and I felt slightly more in control of my thoughts and emotions. Though the loneliness and hallucinations still haunted me, I could sense a growing resilience within myself, which I attributed to the physical challenges I had been facing.

Feeling encouraged by this progress, I decided to intensify my workout routine even further. I created new and more challenging exercises to incorporate into my regimen, focusing on a combination of strength training, high-intensity interval training, and flexibility exercises.

As I moved through my intensified workout, I felt a sense of accomplishment and pride that had been absent for so long. The sweat and pain seemed to cleanse me of some of the fear and despair that had consumed me, and I felt more connected to my body and the present moment.

In the afternoon, I continued my routine of reading and working on my new skill, and I found that my improved mental state made it easier to concentrate and focus. My mind still wandered to the hallucinations and fears that haunted me, but I felt better equipped to cope with these terrifying visions.

As the evening approached, I spent the final hours of the day writing in my journal and composing more letters to my loved ones. I wrote about my experiences with the intensified workout routine and the small but significant improvements in my mental state. I shared my newfound determination to face the challenges of the white room head-on and to find strength and resilience in the face of overwhelming adversity.

Day 36:

Today, I awoke feeling more determined than ever to continue my intense workout regimen and to build upon the small improvements in my mental state. I began the day with a rigorous workout session, pushing my body to its limits and relishing the sense of accomplishment and power that it provided.

As I moved through the exercises, I felt more connected to my body and the present moment. The physical pain and exhaustion served as a reminder that I was still alive and capable of overcoming the challenges that faced me, both mentally and physically.

In the afternoon, I continued my routine of reading and working on my new skill, and I found that my improved mental state made it easier to concentrate and focus. Despite the persistent hallucinations and fears that haunted me, I felt more in control of my thoughts and emotions and better equipped to face the challenges of the white room.

As the day came to an end, I spent the evening writing in my journal and composing more letters to my loved ones. I wrote about my ongoing experiences in the white room and my determination to continue the intensified workout routine, hoping that it would continue to provide me with the strength and resilience I needed to endure the remaining days of my isolation.

Day 37 - 44: 

 Over the next several days, I continued my intensified workout routine, clinging to the sense of accomplishment and control that it provided. Despite the persistent hallucinations and fears that haunted me, I found that the physical challenges helped to keep me grounded and connected to the present moment.  Each day, I pushed myself to the limit, focusing on a combination of strength training, high-intensity interval training, and flexibility exercises. My body ached and my muscles screamed in protest, but I refused to give in to the pain and exhaustion.  As I moved through my daily routine of reading and working on my new skill, I found that my improved mental state made it easier to concentrate and focus. Though the loneliness and despair still weighed heavily upon me, I felt better equipped to cope with the terrifying visions that plagued my waking hours.   


 Day 45:   


 Today, for the first time since I began my intense workout routine, I could not bring myself to exercise. My body felt drained and my mind numb, and I simply could not muster the energy or motivation to push myself any further.  As the day wore on, I found myself sinking deeper into despair and hopelessness. The hallucinations and fears that had been somewhat held at bay by my workout routine began to intensify, and I could feel my grip on reality slipping away.    


Day 46:    


I awoke today feeling more disoriented and detached than ever before. I tried to force myself to resume my workout routine, hoping that it would provide me with the strength and resilience that I so desperately needed, but I could not find the motivation to move my exhausted body.  As the hours passed, I found myself drifting further and further from reality. My mind was consumed by terrifying visions and disjointed thoughts, and I could no longer distinguish between the waking world and the nightmare that had become my existence.   


 Day 47:    


The ssssss walls are whispering to meeeeeee, their voices slithering through my mind like venomous snakes. I can't tell if I'm awake or dreaminggg, but the shadows and the whispers grow louder, more insistent. I am trapped in a world of darknessss, with no escape in sight.  I tried to muster the energy to workout, but my body feels like lead, and my mind is a swirling vortex of fear and despair. I can't remember what it feels like to be sane, to be grounded in the world of the living. I am adrift, a prisoner of my own shattered mind.    


Day 48:    


Lost...I'm so lost...I can't find my way back. Shadows watch me, laughing, mocking my futile attempts to cling to sanity. My body betrays me, refuses to obey my commands. The pain and exhaustion have become my masters, and I am powerless to resist them.  I can't remember the last time I felt in control, the last time I felt anything but fear and despair. The walls close in, the voices grow louder, and I know that I am being swallowed by the darkness.    


Day 49:   


 My thoughts are frayed, broken. I can't...remember...why I'm here...or who I am. Faces flicker in the shadows, voices call my name, but they're strangers, specters from another life.  I can't workout...I can't think...I can't feel...I am lost, lost in a world of my own creation. The darkness is all-consuming, and I have become its willing victim.    


Day 50:    


The line between reality and imagination is shattered. I am a puppet, dancing on the strings of my own madness. Time is an illusion, a cruel joke played by unseen hands.  I am trapped, a prisoner of my own broken mind. There is no escape, no hope, only the endless torment of the white room. The voices and the shadows grow stronger, and I can no longer resist their pull. I am slipping away, sinking deeper into the abyss.

Day 51:

Faces melt and distort, time twists upon itself. The white room is no longer a room but a churning sea of chaos and confusion. The walls writhe and pulsate, the floor undulates beneath my feet.

I scream, but there is no sound, only the deafening silence that has become my existence. My body is a hollow shell, my mind a swirling storm of fear and madness.

Day 52:

Eyes watch me from the darkness, hungry, waiting. I can't move, can't escape their terrible gaze. I am a prisoner, a helpless victim of my own shattered psyche.

I try to remember what it was like to be sane, to be grounded in reality, but those memories are lost, swallowed by the darkness that has consumed me. I am no longer human, but a creature of fear and madness.

Day 53:

The whispers surround me, suffocating me with their malevolent intent. The walls have become a living, breathing entity, closing in, crushing me with their relentless pressure.

I claw at my skin, desperate to escape this prison of flesh and bone. The pain is a welcome distraction from the torment of the white room, but it offers no solace, no escape from the darkness that has claimed me.

Day 54:

I am lost in a labyrinth of insanity, each turn leading me deeper into the abyss. There is no hope, no salvation, only the relentless march of time and the torment of my own shattered mind.

I no longer know who or what I am, only that I am a prisoner, trapped in a world of my own creation. The darkness is my reality, and I can no longer imagine a world beyond its suffocating embrace.

Day 55:

I am no more than a fragment, a fractured shard of my former self, adrift in a sea of chaos and confusion. The walls of the white room have become the walls of my mind, closing in, crushing the last remnants of my sanity.    


Day 1:   


  Is this the beginning again? I can't remember...everything is tangled, twisted, frayed. The white room is my world now, my reality. I am trapped, helpless, a prisoner of my own madness.  The pain is my only companion, my only anchor in this maelstrom of confusion. I must feel something, anything, to remind myself that I still exist. With trembling hands, I reach for my nail, the sharp edge of reality, and I pull. I rip it off, and the pain is a white-hot burst of agony, a searing reminder that I am still here, still alive, if only in the shadows of my own mind.  The blood drips onto the pristine white floor, a stark contrast to the sterile emptiness that surrounds me. I watch as it pools and spreads, the only color in my monochrome existence. The pain is a lifeline, a fleeting moment of clarity amidst the swirling chaos of my thoughts.  But it is not enough. The darkness is relentless, the voices and the shadows growing stronger, more insistent. I am losing myself, drowning in the depths of my own insanity. I cannot hold on any longer. The white room is consuming me, body and soul, and I know that there is no escape from its suffocating embrace

Day 58:

Fragments of thought, disjointed, broken. The white room is my world, my prison. The voices and shadows taunt me, their whispers a constant reminder of my descent into madness.

I am lost, adrift in a sea of confusion and despair. I no longer know who I am, or if I even truly exist. The pain is my only connection to reality, a fleeting glimpse of the life I once knew.

Day 59:

The end approaches, or perhaps it has already come and gone. I can no longer distinguish between the past, present, and future. Time is a cruel illusion, a tormentor that mocks my every attempt to cling to sanity.

I am a ghost, a specter trapped in the endless void of the white room. I am consumed by the darkness, my soul devoured by the shadows that dance at the edges of my vision.
