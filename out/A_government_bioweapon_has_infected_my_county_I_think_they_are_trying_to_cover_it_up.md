I am currently writing this from the safe zone. I don’t have much longer to write before they burst through the gates; I only have hours at most. To whoever is reading this, I will start from the beginning of the outbreak. For context, I live in a small suburb close to one of the major coastal cities. It began 10 days ago, it was a cloudy day when I got the announcement on my phone; I was making breakfast when my phone started buzzing rapidly.  
I picked up my phone to read the text; I expected it to be from a friend or my boss. Instead, I was surprised when I read this, “Attention: All residents of Woodward County are advised to stay inside and lock all doors and windows, no matter what noises you hear, stay inside and do not make any noises or movement, avoid any contact with strangers. More updates will come.” The message shocked me; I texted my neighbor, Henry, asking him if he got the exact text. I looked outside the window.  
There were clouds in the sky, but they didn’t look menacing enough to be a bad storm. I assumed there was a possibility of a Hurricane coming through, but that wouldn’t have made sense as there would have been news channels talking about it days in advance. I turned on the morning news. There was no coverage of anything going on, it only showed the icon of the News channel, and below it showed the same message I got on my phone. “What the hell?” I said to myself. Just then, my phone dinged and I got a brief message from my neighbor Henry, it said “Yes, I got the same message, no idea what it is. I have been asking other neighbors about what is going on and they have not a clue either.” I quickly glanced at the text, looks like everyone else is in the same boat as me, confused and wondering what was going on.  
I wondered if this was a possible prank someone was playing, but if it was, then why did the News media stop their broadcasting? None of this made any sense. I decided the smart idea was to skip work as the emergency alert I received seemed pretty serious. I decided to follow the directions of the alert and started closing all my windows, locking any doors both upstairs and downstairs that could lead to outside. I was taking the same precautions as I would with any other natural precautions, such as any other natural disaster Florida could have.  
I decided to start barricading the windows as well just to play it safe, in the back of my mind I was really thinking that it was just another hurricane coming through that the weather stations didn’t pick up until the last minute. That’s when I received another alert from my phone, about 5 hours from the first one, it stated “Attention: Do not open your doors or windows under any circumstances, do not invite anyone into your home regardless if they are your friends or your family. They could be infected. More updates will come.”  
Hang on a minute, infected? I was confused about this, I didn't receive any news of a disease going around, I tried looking online for news in my local area about any sort of disease, but there was nothing that stated anything like that. I tried looking through all my messages from my friends I have texted in the past 24 hours to see if they told me anything, but then I reread Henry’s text “Yes, I got the same message, no idea what it is. I have been asking other neighbors about what is going on and they have not a clue either. One of them mentioned something about an outbreak, not entirely sure what it means though.” How could I not have seen that last sentence? I must have skipped over that last part when reading the text. This changed the whole game for me. The next 3 days were filled with anxiousness and dread, it was the morning on the 4th day when I got called by my neighbor Henry,  
Me\*: Hello?\*  
Henry: Holy shit, you need to look outside your window, don’t open the blinds but just peek through them.  
I opened them and saw to my horror, multiple houses from across the street with broken windows and open doors. There were stains of blood on the porch of the house right across the street from me.  
Me: What the hell happened…what is this, why is everyone’s houses trashed? And why is there blood stains on the McKenzie’s house?  
Henry: I saw them last night, there was a group of 10-20 people that were walking aimlessly down the street. These people are not normal though, they walk like they are stumbling and about to fall, they bump into people’s houses, cars, and streetlamps, its is like they have no sense of direction and are confused. One of the Mackenzies opened their door after one of people bumped into the door, that’s when I saw it…a lot of blood, I didn’t watch all of what happened, but I am guessing that they are not alive anymore.  
Me: What do you mean these people, what were they acting like? Zombies?  
Henry: Yes, yes! Precisely that! Although, not entirely either, although they don’t have good coordination, they can still talk to each other, communicate. The thing is as well, they don’t look like zombies either, they don’t have flesh rotting off of them or anything, they look just like you and me. However, they do foam at the mouth, that is one of their biggest traits.  
Me: Ok, but…  
Henry: Listen, listen…we don’t have much time left here, they are raiding people’s houses, I heard screaming all throughout the night, I have a feeling they know people are hiding in their houses and will try to break in, it won’t be long before it's our houses they will try to break into. I suggest that tonight, we leave our houses and slip under the quiet of the night, do you have a gun by any chance?  
Me: Yes  
Henry: Great, let’s both bring our guns and meet up in the woods behind our houses, you know where Littleton creek is?  
Me: Yeah, I do  
Henry: Let's meet there, its about a mile away from our houses and we should be a safe distance from those people. Listen, I know a lot about what’s going on with this outbreak, I can explain it more tonight but we got to get ready and go. There is only a couple hours left until the night comes. Have you seen the new emergency alert?  
Me: No, I haven’t yet I—  
Henry: Read it as soon as you can, we can go to the safe zone right after we meet up. I got to go and pack up, meet up at the creek tonight.  
\*click\*  
The phone call ended, and there I was standing by myself in the quietness of my house, almost all of this felt too unreal, only a few days ago I was living a normal life and now I was tossed into the den of lions to fight for my survival, that’s what it felt like. As I stood there, I suddenly remembered what Henry told me, it was to read the emergency alert. I pulled out my phone and saw this “Attention: All residents of Woodward and surrounding counties should leave their homes and go into the town square, there is a safe zone that is protected by Federal troops. If you are unable to make it into the city, please stay in your house until further notice. More updates will come”  
I guess that is Henry’s plan, to meet up at the creek and walk the 15-some miles into the center of the city. I was growing more nervous by the minute as I started packing, either way was suicide in my opinion, if we went outside those infected people, if you even call them people would see us and hunt us, whereas if we stayed inside we would lose our supplies overtime and die if they don’t already break into our houses. But I would rather go down fighting outside than stay inside and hide. I packed as much water and food as I could, and I also made sure to bring 20 rounds of ammunition for my rifle. Just as I loaded my gun, I heard a crash downstairs, there was the sound of a broken window and more terrifying was the sound of feet running up the stairs.  
I aimed my rifle at the stairs and fired at the first infected person I saw, 2 more of them came running at me and I chambered another shot into the barrel and fired hitting another one, he fell to the ground and screamed, I felt my eardrums sting but I had no time to think as the 3rd guy came after me, I wasn’t thinking properly and I threw one of my lamps straight at the guy’s head. It hit him, and he fell to the floor, it gave me enough time for me to start running upstairs in the hope I could climb outside onto my roof to escape, I started running up the stairs but tripped as he grabbed my leg. His hands were a feeling I could never forget, they were drenched with saliva yet he had a strong grip. I hit him with my rifle, and he wreathed in pain from that, again just barely giving me enough time to run upstairs and into the nearest room where I shut the door and locked it.  
A couple of seconds after locking it, there was a slam on the other side of the door as well as grunting and groaning. I saw the window on the other side of the room, knowing that it would lead to the window where I could climb onto the roof and escape. I opened the window, threw my gear on the roof and was beginning the climb outside when I heard the infected man say, “I know you’re trying to escape, but don’t bother, if you escape from us today, then we will get you tomorrow. You can’t win this game.” Those words will be engrained in my memory forever.  
I remember Henry saying something earlier about how they could talk to each other. I then heard a crack in the door and realized I needed to get going, I couldn’t freeze up with the door about to give in any second. I climbed through onto the roof and jumped down onto my backyard where I made a dash into the woods with my rifle and pack. It was dusk when I It was so dark in those woods, I could barely see anything 10 feet in front of me, I was such an idiot that I forgot to bring a flashlight. My only saving grace was that I knew the general direction of the creek and started walking to there. It took me half an hour to get to the creek, with the darkness and how heavy my pack is, I was glad I just made it to there. I decided here to wait for Henry. But he never showed up. Even after a couple hours, he never showed up. I prayed that I would hear footsteps, but I never did.  
After a while, I decided to trudge along in the darkness. I won’t go into much detail here except that it took me 2 days to hike the 15 miles, mostly hiding during the day so none of the infected could see me. As I got close to the town square, I saw the safe zone, a heavily guarded place with one entrance in, inside were police officers and National Guard soldiers. I am currently spending the night here and it has been storming all night. I have learned more about the outbreak from some of the other people here. A couple of weeks ago there was a genetically- modified parasite that escaped the lab and got into some of the local wildlife, it eventually got its way into humans and has rampaged my county and other surrounding counties. The parasite gives the host symptoms similar to the rabies virus and has the ability to mind control humans. The parasite’s only goal is to infect as many as possible, and it will stop at nothing. I have even heard rumors throughout the safe that the parasite was designed to be a bioweapon funded by the government. This is supposed to be the ultimate killing machine. I wish I could tell you more about this parasite, but there is such little I know right now.  
Because this was a bioweapon accidentally let loose, federal agents are at the safe zone confiscating any phone or tablet other civilians have. They are trying to bury a secret here. They haven’t found me with my phone yet, but they will soon. What’s even worse is that I have heard the parasite will sometimes go dormant in people so they won’t show any symptoms. I am truly frightened right now as it is almost dawn and there is a horde of those infected with the parasite standing at the gate right outside the safe zone and they are desperately trying to get in. Along with that, there may already be infected people inside this safe zone with the parasite lying dormant inside them. Please, someone help me soon, I don't have much time left until they breach the gates.
