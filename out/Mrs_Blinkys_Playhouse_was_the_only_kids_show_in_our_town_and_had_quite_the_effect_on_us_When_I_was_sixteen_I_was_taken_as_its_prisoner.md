I can still remember the exact dance moves to the opening theme of 
Mrs. Blinky’s Playhouse. 

Two steps to the left.

Two steps to the right.

Wave your hands!

Do a twirl!

Do another twirl!

Hands!

Gabbles, fall over.

… 

“Delusion?”

At the age of fifteen years old, I definitely wasn’t supposed to be making faces at the mayor’s son through the gap in the doctor’s office door. He started it. I was trying to ignore my Mom's conversation with the man in black, anyway, so bugging my eyes out at Rowan Wainwright was much more appealing than hearing my slow descent into insanity described in way too much detail—for what must have been the third or fourth time. I had heard “reality” and “hallucinate” far too many times, the words were starting to sound alien. I didn’t understand why Mom kept asking him and expecting a different answer as if I would be magically cured if she asked enough times. 

“What do you mean by delusion? Are you trying to tell me this thing will make her crazy?” Mom’s cry collapsed into a hiss, which was more of a silver color, like ocean waves rippling in the air. Ow. That color hurt. It might have been pretty to look at but definitely not what you wanted feathering your vision, pulsing in time with Mom’s words. 

It was like someone was going bang, bang, bang with a brick in the back of my skull.  “Is that what you’re saying?!” Her voice was starting to go higher in pitch and I resisted the urge to press my hands over my ears. With the conversation going on around me between my mother and the two men in black, there were currently three colors dancing in my eyes. Mean and Nice were dull shades of blue and purple respectively, while Mom had gone from a more orangey yellow to blinding, headache-inducing silver. 

I did what I always did when colors became distracting and painful. I distracted myself. Now, there was not much to fully lose myself in inside a doctor’s office with nothing interesting except maybe the “safe sex” posters glued on the walls (Interesting, because whose idea was it to have them Halloween themed in the middle of July?) So, I focused on the mayor’s son who had lifted his head from where it had been buried in his sweater and turned his attention and half-lidded eyes to me. It started as a staring contest. Who could blink first? I won by default when the doors to the waiting room slammed shut, and the feedback sent both of us almost diving out of our seats. Somehow, I managed to keep myself from reacting, while he seemed to be knocked off of kilter, blinking rapidly, his lips curving into a pained frown.

I knew that expression. I wondered if the mayor’s son could see the colors and lines with sound too; soundwaves overlapping and enveloping each other. If it wasn’t so fucking distracting and a total pain in the ass, I might have thought it was beautiful. For a moment, I wondered if the mayor’s son was going to gesture to the colors he was clearly seeing too, or even just smiling at me. He wasn’t known for smiling or being friendly. The kindest he’d been was deciding not to beat up a kid who blew a dog whistle in his face in sophomore year. For him, that was progress. Though I often wondered if the kid’s anger wasn’t just down to the sensitivity fucking with his emotions.

Ever since we were little kids and he was outed as one of the sensitive ones, he had initially been hidden away—and an announcement was made that the rumors concerning the mayor’s son having the sensitivity were false. That was in the early days when our own parents were both afraid for us—and of us. However, with age, it became harder to hide a twelve-year-old with a serious anger problem and obvious vulnerability to sound, so the mayor made another television announcement. This time Rowan stood right next to him with a big smile that had too many teeth and hollow eyes that definitely wished death on every camera on him as well as the audience at home. He might as well have been holding a sign which said, “I am being forced to be here”. Coincidentally, town elections happened to be that year—and what more said caring father and mayor than a man willing to admit his son suffered from the affliction? 

Cue Rowan being part of every TV press conference as well as festival, just to prove how “well” he was. Admittedly, yes, the earplugs all of us Sensitives had been given by the men in black did help, but I often found myself wondering if the mayor’s son was worse than me. Even with the plugs in, he would clamp his hands over his ears during loud festivals full of screaming children, and sometimes I caught his hands creeping towards his ears during television appearances--  only for his mother to gently lower his arm with an even bigger grin towards the camera which definitely silently warned him not to appear affected. So, it made sense why Rowan Wainwright was blinking at me with a crinkled expression and contorted lips.

I decided to try to talk to him with my mouth. *Can you see them?*

The boy seemed offended I’d plucked up the courage to talk to him. He looked like he was going to ignore me, before feigning confusion. I knew he was pretending to be confused because I’d caught him mouthing *I will fucking kill you* to a girl loudly threatening to blast a bunch of sensitive kids when they were least expecting it. The girl mouthed back that she was sorry, and he went on to mouth several words I’m probably not allowed to write. But anyway, yeah, the asshole was being intentionally ignorant. *What?* He mouthed back, and I don’t know if it was the ultraviolet rays of light pounding in time with the chatter in the waiting room, but my blood boiled. This guy was impossible to communicate with. He was like a brick wall.  I knew he could see the colors and the lines. I knew I wasn’t alone. Instead of arguing with him, I just made a huge deal of rolling my eyes and turning back to the conversation of, “What exactly is delusion?” Which was just Mom trying to google the definition, and Nice and Mean trying to explain to her that it wasn’t as simple as a Google search. 

I had the last laugh though. 

When Rowan was least expecting it, I pulled a face at him. It didn’t take long for me to be caught after Nice made the mistake of laughing at a particularly stupid face I’d made at Rowan, who rolled his eyes and shot me the finger again. “Juniper! How old are you?!” My mother was right. I was acting like a kid. 

“Miss Lana, I can assure you there is very little chance of this happening again. We have already told you check-ups are a precaution. Juniper and the other inflicted children are perfectly safe.”  

Nice kept that smile, but he wouldn’t look my Mom in the eyes.

Mean, though, nodded along to my mother’s grievances. “Well, as my colleague has told you numerous times, the likelihood of your daughter being exposed to the frequency is very low,” he leaned forward, “However…” His gaze found mine, and I caught a slight quirk in the man’s lips. Mean was smiling.  Which was crazy because he never smiled. “Juniper would start to experience visual and auditory hallucinations which will feel very real.” 

With his voice filling my head like cotton candy, I twisted back to the mayor’s son, who winked at me with a very uncharacteristic grin. I got up from the chair and walked straight past my mother who was still arguing with the agents. I was planning on striding straight up to Rowan and giving him a piece of my mind for intentionally ignoring me. But when he dropped onto his knees, expression twisting with agony, and slammed his hands over his ears, screaming for his dad to stop, I stumbled back. 

*Stop! Stop, dad! Stop!"*

The mayor’s son mouthed the words, scarlet pooling between his fingers and sliding his nose. I attempted to go to him and help the boy, but then he wasn’t a boy at all. Instead of a human teenager, a large suit of ragged and bloodstained fur towered over me. 

Mr. Gabbles's stitched eyes bored into my own.  I watched huge floppy hands grasp onto its head and attempt to pull it off, but it was glued to him, sealed to his flesh. The agent’s voice didn’t leave my mind, becoming a staple in my thought as I watched this monstrosity, which was both the mayor’s son and not, human, and not, attempt to rip himself from the thing suffocating him. But when he did, he was just tearing at his own flesh, at chunks of gore pouring out of him, glistening innards stuck to his paws.  

*Auditory and visual hallucinations… which will feel very real,* Mr Mean’s explanation continued. *Think of it like this. It will be like disassociating from reality. In this state, Juniper will feel both at peace and not, and be unable to differentiate fiction from reality. It is an unfortunate side-effect of the brain essentially going into shut down in an attempt to protect her from the frequency. The pain will very much be there, however, she will not be able to feel it while in this certain state…* That was where I kind of lost him. Too many big words for me to describe and explanations I don’t even know myself. Something about neural pathways, and hacking into the brain, opening it to new possibilities. Which was why the frequency was engineered. 

Now, that caused alarm bells. I was aware enough to question why those specific words had come out of nowhere. But he just continued without elaborating.  However, whatever hacking was, required a strong mind, and according to the two of them, I definitely did not qualify as a worthy contender. In fact, I was one of the weaker ones, which was why my symptoms leading to my death were described more akin to a horror movie. I have to give him credit, though. Mean was pretty fucking accurate in describing my descent into madness.

Insanity is not what you think it is. It’s not glorified Alice and Wonderland “We’re all mad here!” bullshit. The Cheshire cat wouldn't have lasted ten minutes as part of Mrs Blinky's gang. 

I used to think madness was cool. I guess read enough edgy teen novels glorifying psychosis in teenage girls and listen to enough Melanie Martinez and yes, you do start to subconsciously “want” to so-called lose yourself.

However, that is not madness. Madness is being lost and unable to find yourself in a seemingly never-ending colorful carousel of nothing which is drowning you, enveloping you in darkness and waiting for you to crack. Something was going on in my head and I wasn’t where I was supposed to be. 

Because I didn’t want it to be there. I didn’t want reality around me. I didn’t want the stage lights blinding my eyes and inhuman faces staring back at me in the shadows. I didn’t want awkward dancing and falling to my knees, screaming for it to all end—for everything to end. I don’t know if my mind shattered into a million pieces or if I just escaped. The best thing about falling and completely losing yourself, your identity, and your will to live, as well as your marbles, you can do anything you want. Your imagination is your fucking oyster.  The beautiful thing about fantasy is, you can take yourself away from the bad and replace it with the good. I blinked myself away from the mayor’s son screaming and ripping himself apart, and I was somewhere entirely else. 

I wasn’t sure where at first. I was sitting in a plush comfortable chair surrounded by natural light. It was some kind of dressing room. When I looked down at myself, I was wearing a blue dress that perfectly hugged my curves. “Are you nervous?"

Sadie was suddenly in front of me, and bizarrely, she was holding a pack of peanut butter girl scout cookies. I felt the soft bristles of her makeup brush on my face. It tickled, and I found myself laughing. Sadie smelled like rotting, and her smile was stained claret, but I ignored it. I ignored the gaping hole in the middle of her forehead as she applied my mascara and then eyeliner, smiling the whole time, telling me I looked beautiful. 

When she was finished, the girl led me onto a stage. This one was brightly lit with a couch for guests and a desk and spinning chair for the host. I started walking towards my seat, but my dress was really getting stuffy. The material felt almost wrong when I brushed my hands over it. I couldn’t understand why I felt so hot, so suffocated. There were open windows and a fan appearing seemingly out of nowhere, blasting cool air in my face which was an instant relief. 

But no matter how many times I fanned myself, I couldn’t get cool. 

“Yo, are you sitting down?” 

The voice was a mixture of human and cartoon character. 

I twisted around to find Mr. Gabbles standing in front of me with his usual funny smile and long nose. Weirdly, he didn’t look like Gabbles. He had a very-human like form. In place of the usual bright green overalls was a fitted white shirt and tie. Instead of fluffy horns sticking out of his usual oddly deformed head, I found myself staring at much more realistic cow horns protruding from a normal head of brown curls. I nodded and took my seat, with him squeezing next to me. The rest of Mrs. Blinky’s gang arrived. Tootles, wearing bright red lipstick and an evening gown, her floppy brown ears bouncing as she strutted on stage. Then Bam-Bam. 

I was surprised how much he suited a leather jacket and jeans despite having the head of an anthropomorphic animal. *Wake the fuck up.* Gabbles's voice struck me for a moment. Because it didn’t sound like Gabbles. It didn’t have that high-pitched giggle curving his every word. When I turned to him, I realized he was sweating. His forehead was clammy, and taking a closer look, the character’s horns looked like they were hurting him, smears of red where the intrusions were stuck in his skull. It was his facial expression which started to drag me back to fruition, to what I was desperately trying to run from. 

The character’s face looked odd. 

He still had that wide grin, but the stitches coming apart were on human lips attempting to widen into a scream before contorting and twisting into another maniacal grin, pulling me further into cotton candy clouds and rainbows. He must have caught my expression because he laughed like he always did—exactly like I remembered from the show's original run. “What’s wrong, Mrs Blinky?” He hollered, slapping his thighs which was one of his usual gags. “You look like you’ve seen a spooky ghost!” Gabbles tripped up suddenly, a phantom audience laughing at his antics. I felt my own lips form a smile, my inner child coming back to haunt me. How many times had I wanted to reach through the TV and poke his horns? 

*Do you hear me? Wake up!*

The voice brought a wave of clarity I did not want. It made me remember my face was glued against sticky fur, and I was imprisoned inside my favorite childhood character. Gabbles's eyes bored into mine, his lips curling into a scowl. *Please,* he whimpered, his voice breaking into a pained cry, bringing the aroma of spoiled milk choking me. I could sense a shadow next to me, back in reality, and when I concentrated, I could see the figure curled into himself, his arms covering his head, his body trembling against mine. *I need you to snap out of it, because they're not going to stop until we're dead–*

His voice cracked into a howl.

I couldn’t speak, my throat suddenly adopting a heartbeat. I could see the audience in front of us, inhuman faces staring back at me. “All right, we’re going live in three…” a voice shouted, slicing through the words in my mouth. I wanted to speak to Gabbles, but he was already turning away from me with another one of his goofy laughs. 

"Two..." A figure rushed into view, partially blocked by the white light drowning the stage. I recognized reddish curls and the exact same shirt he had died in. I remembered the blood stains on his collar and dripping down his shirt, the ugly splatter of red slick on the side of his cheek and ears when his body was carried into an old witch’s house, shuddering on a stranger's shoulder. The boy looked good as new, but the uncanny feeling still slammed into me. I could see the shadow of blood stains start to appear in smatters, and as if he had noticed me noticing, Harry Blake lifted his head to smile at me. Something sour crept up my throat when my classmate jumped onto the host's chair, fidgeting with the mic on his shirt. He gave us all a cheery wave, and I bit back the urge to say, "Wait, Harry, aren't you dead?" 

Tipping his head back so a makeup artist could apply blush to his grey-looking cheeks, he winked at me, and my chest tightened. "One..." The voice with no body, no identity, shouted behind me. Harry shooed away the makeup artists, prodding his face with brushes and taming his curls. He had a whole entourage to make him look pretty for the camera. Well, of course, he did. Harry was dead. I saw him get his brains fried. In front of us, the lights dimmed, and he had a knee-jerk reaction when the cameras found him, his lips stretching into a grin. "And we are **BACK** with Mrs. Blinky's gang!" 

He waved at all of us, and I found myself waving back with a smile.

"It's great to meet all of you!"  Harry kept a wide smile, and the audience cheered. He was a natural for the camera, shooting all six angles a Hollywood grin. "Mrs. Blinky, I love the dress! Gabbles, you look ah-ma-zing. Straight out of Vogue, dude." When I turned, Gabbles did look great. Better. White shirt perfectly fitted, black pants, dark brown hair slicked back by a pair of raybans. His horns were gone. Mr. Gabbles offered him a small smile, and the audience of children giggled. "Now," Harry continued. "I gotta ask. Just where exactly is that bracelet you're always wearing?" 

When Gabbles didn't answer, his face shrouded in shadow, Harry chuckled. "Oooh, a shy one?" The audience mimicked his reaction but Gabbles didn’t react, only ducking his head. I did notice Harry was right though. Where was his bracelet? Before the thought could fully come to fruition in my mind, Harry’s bright eyes flicked from Gabbles to me. "But the real question is for Mrs. Blinky herself," he announced. I leaned forward in my suffocating dress which felt like fur prickling against my skin. His lips split into a skeletal grin, his teeth stained bright red. I was suddenly far too awake, then, a familiar pain pounding in the back of my head-- a tinny ringing beginning its slow takeover of my sluggish thoughts. 

I could feel myself growing warmer, and something was drowning me, suffocating over my head. When my vision blurred and my head swam, I was blinking through two tiny pinpricks. Harry Blake's smile faded, and next to me, the others turned to me with sudden accusing eyes. But even they were starting to blur into nothing, into nonsensical colors.   "So, Mrs Blinky," The dead boy leaned forward, almost slumping, pinkish froth dripping from his ears and pooling on his desk. 

The ringing was getting worse. I could feel myself dropping to my knees, suddenly. No. I was already kneeling. 

The world was so much darker, and there was no light. No escape. No doors. Nothing but those exact same faces staring at me from the crowd. 

There were voices around me, but my fantasy strayed for a moment, a fancy studio in front of smiling children surrounded by all my favorite characters on the cusp of splintering into a much darker reality. Harry's voice chased me back to what I was trying to desperately hide from, a world I didn't want to face, a force tearing into my skull, and something wet and coppery sticking to prickly fur suffocating my breathing. The boy’s voice twisted into the exact same cry I heard when he dropped dead at the mercy of the noise. "Why the fuck did you let me die?" 

I laughed along with the audience. 

If I didn’t laugh, I’d open my eyes and see my reality. I would see the suffocating head of fur forced over my head and duct taped in place.

I would remember that I couldn’t breathe, inhaling the stink of my own blood and body odor choking the suit. Something pierced the back of my head, carving a cry onto my lips. No. I willed myself back into my own head. Away from the ringing. The voices.  The Blinky gang turned to frown at me, their expressions accusing. Tootles’s smile faded, her usual bright knitted eyes narrowing. “Mrs Blinky, what did you do?” she whispered, folding her arms across her dress. “Harry was one of our favorite viewers.”

I shook my head. “No, he's clearly alive!"

“Oh, yeah?” Harry stuck his index into one ear and scooped out a chunk of fleshy pink, and something inside me snapped. “Do I look alive to you?” He went in again, this time carving out a piece of skull which dropped onto the desk with a wet-sounding smack. “I did tell you we should skip her house, but noo, you insisted on making sure every elder gets a cookie.” He plucked out his right eye with a smile, and I could glimpse the trauma from when the noise had pierced through him.  

“And whaddya know? I was right."

His words were like pinpricks. His lip curved. “I’m sure I’m grossing you out too, right?” Leaning across his desk, the boy jutted his chin. “Tell me I’m scaring you,” he murmured. 

“No." 

I spoke too fast and too soon, and Harry seemed to enjoy that. He was way more sadistic then I remembered.  "It's not like I can help it. I can’t fucking do anything if I’m dead, can I?” He rolled his eyes, “You let that witch blast open my skull and turn you into a cartoon squirrel, and you're not even fighting back. You're a fucking coward." 

"I can't fight back!" 

Harry cocked his head. "Have you tried?" 

He did that finger-tap thing he always did in class, which drove me insane. Tap, tap, tapping on his desk. Harry’s lips broke out into a grin which collapsed into a skeletal mouth that I had already seen slowly decomposing, as Harry’s body had lilted in front of every performance we had been forced to do, and every show that was broadcast. I always found myself finding Harry and Sadie. Sadie’s head had thankfully drooped. But somehow, Harry Blake’s body was crumbling away, dead eyes still boring into mine. “I couldn’t save you,” I gritted out. “What was I supposed to do?"

He shrugged. “Covered my ears?”

“You were already dying.”

“True. But you could have easily given me mouth to mouth or I don’t know, called the freakin’ cops?”

“I was affected too, you know!"

The boy’s eyes darkened. “Well, how about in the studio? You guys just stand there every day. You could throw something over me for one,” he said. “Jeez. Give me some privacy while I decompose." he tipped his head back and blew a raspberry. “It’s the least you could do after, you know, letting me die."

“Boooo!”

The audience joined him.

“Murderer!”

“How could you?” Mr Gabbles whispered, and I felt my eyes fill with tears, my throat choked up. Be turned to me, his large eyes disappointed in me. “Come on, what did I always say during the bedtime song?” I didn’t think I would be able to remember it, but somehow I did. I remembered my little self standing in front of the TV set and reciting his words spoken in a lullaby sing-song.

“A Gabbles a day keeps the sadness away,” I whispered. “Yes, but—”

“Ju-ni-per!"

The voice carved into an agonizing wail that was suddenly too real to ignore snapped me back to the real world, my head swimming, flashes of hazy red, orange, and yellow dancing in front of my eyes. The ringing sound was back, clawing its way into my skull. I could feel my attempts to wrench the character’s head off, but if I did—it would be cranked to the highest setting. That’s what they told us. 

That was the threat haunting the backs of our minds. If we tried to show ourselves, our real selves, then our brains would bleed and we would scream for mercy.  The world flickered like TV static, and I was in the middle of the stage illuminated in a spotlight. Someone was next to me. The mayor’s son drowning in purple and blue, his matted Gabbles head pressed into the ground. I could taste rich copper at the back of my throat and staining my teeth and tongue, feel something cold in my human hands caged inside my suit.

*They're go... ing to tu.... it on! 

He heaved out a breath, trembling next to me, his large furry paws trying to cover his ears. I couldn’t make sense of my own thoughts, of his words which sounded like ocean waves lapping over me. They were there one moment. Gone the next. 

The mayor’s son’s words perforated me with enough force to drag me back to reality, to my own mute scream begging for death. I blinked and the first thing I saw was Harry Blake’s face in the shadowed audience. I had been using his body as a passage of time. 

Months. 

Two or three, judging by how his state was still mostly intact except for his skeletal mouth and the caverns where his eyes used to be. The voice erupted around me, another order for us to get to our feet and prepare for the next broadcast. We had spent almost five hours going over the choreography, and each time I fell or cried out or dropped to my stomach, all of us were punched. All of us were blasted with the X frequency that had been altered to affect us in different ways. They were definitely using us as guinea pigs. Blinking rapidly, I struggled to get a hold of my surroundings. But the pain was both a physical and mental barrier. 

"Beginning beta version two, stand by, and action. Stand well away from the stage, please! Everyone but our performers! Can you please insert ear plugs now in three, two…"

Lights.

Camera.

Action. 

The air started to move in front of me, squiggly lines blurring into view. 

I couldn’t move with the noise writhing inside my skull. I couldn’t breathe when it was cracking open my thoughts. I drowned in the noise for what felt like hours. When I refused to get to my feet, the frequency pulverising my skull did it for me, puppeteering my body like a marionette. I was Mrs Blinky. I talked about my favorite things, all of my adventures in Blinky's world, and sang all of my children to sleep.

With my vastly deteriorating mental state, the Mrs. Blinky character started to bleed into me. She was an escape from the noise tearing me apart, and a solace I could find comfort in.   It was only when the screams exploded into my mind, did I start to feel a resemblance of myself and not Mrs. Blinky. It started with rainbow sparkles I caught glistening in the light and dripping, seeping across the stage underneath Tootles. It was pretty. 

But I didn’t know where it came from. One minute, Foo-Foo was with the rest of us, and then she was lying on her back in stemming rainbow sparkles. I did remember we were told to keep dancing, with the frequency yanking and pulling our bodies into submission. But halfway through that particular dance, it came again, a wave of noise sending me onto my stomach. 

Something warm exploded from my nose. Gabbles staggered forward. I watched his shadow take one step, and then two, before his large furry arms came up and ripped off the cartoon head. Rowan Wainwright swam into view, eyes wild, lips twisted into a maniacal smile that widened the closer he got to Tootles. His hair was longer, plastered to a clammy forehead with sweat. His whole face glistened revealing, terrifying scarlet. I had never seen him take off his head. 

Not even at night. 

We had to leave them on to keep the Spirit of Blinky alive.  “Gabbles, put your head back on.” The order cut through me and I struggled to see through the rave of colors in my eyes. But Rowan didn’t stop. He kept going, one step after the other, his trembling hands wrapped around his character’s head, swaying from side to side as the noise ripped through him. “Gabbles. We are in the middle of a recording, get back to your marker.”  The voice overlapped the noise in my head, and I found myself questioning why Gabbles wasn’t affected. Well, he was. I could see that in the scarlet seeping from his ears and nose, thick rivulets dripping down his face.

“Last warning,” the voice hissed out before reluctantly yelling, “Cut!”

Another step.

“Mr. Wainwright!” The man whose face was not human gave up on animated character names, and I found myself craving my own spoken from an adult's lips.  

“Let him.”

“But he’s the mayor’s son!"

“Exactly. The boy is an influential figure, and will draw in our viewers."

The voice came from Mrs. Blinky herself—no—I blinked. No, it was the old woman who had kidnapped me. Her voice was gentle and yet had an edge to it. “This is exactly what you wanted, am I correct? In 2010 this was your goal when you turned my children into mindless vegetables. So why stop now?” Tootles inclined her head, her stitched mouth pulled into its usual wide grin. But I could hear the girl screaming inside, her wails for him to not get any closer—and then her character started to move with her, stumbling back. I think the noise was preventing her from fully moving. All she did when she could move was wave her arms manically. 

Something crackled in the air, and I sensed it moving in front of my eyes, splintering into nonsensical squiggles. The brutality of the next blast was hard for me to bear—and even harder for me to describe. It was enough to jolt my body violently, scorching the scream from my throat. I didn’t see it, only heard it, Tootles’ screams, and Rowan’s manical laughter. I heard the plastic head being slammed over and over again into the character’s head before the *thump* of her body hitting the ground. “Abnormal." The voice spoke directly to me. "Crank it right up and we’ll see what we’re working with.” 

His voice sounded odd. Cloudy. Marshmallows. It sounded and felt and tasted like actual cotton candy on my tongue. 

“They’re picking up the beta test. Stop the signal.”  Following the order came a whistling sound. It was different, but somehow despite it not fully breaking into my ears, I felt it rooted inside my skull alongside a sudden overbearing stink that smelled like… rotten fruit. 

It swamped my senses, twisting my gut. The voice loomed over me this time, and when I risked looking up, the ringing sound still bleeding into me, I found myself mesmerized by the explosion of rainbow sparkles seeping across the stage, almost drenching my own hands. The man without a human face stood over me, a shadow drowning me.  I blinked once and then twice. Seven feet away, Tootles didn’t have a head anymore. She didn’t have a human head or her animal head. 

Rowan, who was standing over her, took a shaky step back before lifting his character’s head back on, and letting out an animalistic shriek, cross between a laugh and so. The nail in the coffin was the static flickering suddenly buzzing in my head, and a feeling of something severing in my mind. The mayor's dropped to the ground, like he was the main component, and then so did the rest of us. The buzzing grew louder like a live wire. I writhed on the ground, staring up at a spotlight and imagining my mom breaking through the door and taking me away from that awful place. And she did. My mom burst through the door with a scary scowl, my dead father by her side. Seeing him bruised my heart. “Where is she?” Mom demanded in a cry. 

I’m here, Mom.

*Auditory and visual hallucinations… which will feel very real,* Mr. Mean’s voice was on a loop. *Think of it like this. It will be like disassociating from reality. In this state, Juniper will feel both at peace and not, and be unable to differentiate fiction from reality…*

“This one has the potential to carry the signal, as does the mayor’s brat.” The man without a human face suddenly DID have a human face. “But I don’t want you to push it, okay? If we push it we could lose them, and then lose almost twenty years of work.”

A very familiar human face, illuminated in my bloodstained spotlight where I could see the color drenching the stage.

Not rainbow sparkles.

I was seeing Tootles’s brains leaking around us in a horrifying mixture of macabre and beautiful. I had no idea the human brain could resemble a rainbow.

*Yes, Miss Lana. In the nicest way possible, you could think of it as sleeping.*

Mom knelt with the man, her eyes wide. “It’s going to be okay. I’m here. I’m not going to let anything bad happen to you.” She pressed her hands over her own ears just like she did when I was twelve. “I won’t let it hurt you, Juni.”

*Hallucinations…*

The man crouched in front of me, and the words *fuck you* died in my throat. 

“So far, she seems to be alive,” he cleared his throat. “She’s passed through beta’s one, two, and three. I want it tested on them again. We are so close to a breakthrough."

I was yanked to unsteady feet, the weight of my suit trying to drag me back down. I don’t know how much time had passed before I awoke in what looked and felt like the emergency room. I was Juniper again. I could feel cool air grazing my cheeks and the breeze from the air conditioning blowing my hair from my face. When I searched for my mom, however, I only found a masked woman with dark curls tied into a ponytail standing over me. When I tugged at the restraints strapping me down, the woman pulled back her mask to reveal a smile. “Can you tell me your name?"

“Juniper.”

She hummed before pulling out what looked like a small remote. I only had to see the dial to understand what it was. “Uh-huh. So, Juniper, we’re going to play a small game, okay? Can you tell me exactly how you feel when I play this sound?”

I barely heard the thing, instead bearing the brunt of it cracking open my skull and taking hold of me. My body shuddered, my breath thinning.

“Stop!"

I wrenched at the velcro, but her hands just clamped over mine, rough and clammy, forcing them down. I had to strain my eyes to see her through a wave of colors blurring in my eyes, another smell hitting me. This time it was rich lavender and chocolate. 

“I need answers, Juniper.” 

Her voice hardened and still watching me writhe and squirm against the restraints in an attempt to clamp my hands over my ears, she turned the dial again. This time I screeched, and I wasn’t even aware of my own cry because of the colors and the noise enveloping the stink. I lunged forward, my limbs hers to play with, something warm oozing from my nose. Her manicured nails turned the dial once again, and a tinny ringing sound rocked my skull, this time it was merciless. 

Not that any other time had given me an ounce of mercy, but this one test—this wave of dark lines overlapping my vision was thundering in the back of my head, my heartbeat alive in every organ, my brain straining against the cage of my skull. When my body flopped on the bed, rising into an arch, and violently slamming back down, something finally hit.

Milk. 

The kind of milk that had been left in the refrigerator for way too long. 

Not just that. I could sense someone several feet away. I could feel the agonizing pain in his wrists where they had been sliced open, and the dark and pungent purple cloud drowning him. I didn't *hear* his thoughts. I tasted them on my tongue and at the back of my throat, an overpowering stench. *My dad is coming to get me* His voice hit me, and I could see blurred purple creeping across the walls and bleeding across the floor. *My d--- is c---ming to g--- m---- out of this…h----ll.*

“Last time,” the woman said. “Are you experiencing new symptoms?”

I blinked back darker colors that weren't just sound. It was emotion. I knew exactly what they were. I could see her excitement, her amazement, and her anticipation, as well as a swimming darkness curling around her, pitch-black tendrils wrapped around her neck and suffocating her mouth and nose.

“No,” I lied through a strangled breath.

Any of Mrs Blinky's friends who *did* experience new symptoms, were dragged into a room and never seen again. She leaned forward, her eyebrows knitted together. "Can you by any chance hear or smell any of your friends?" 

“No."

Her lips pricked. "Are you sure?" 

"Yes."

When she lowered the remote, her index finger creeping away from the dial, I hit the bed with a sob, warmth running down my lips and chin. I didn't realize it until the ringing had stopped, that I could taste the mayor's son's thoughts that were growing darker and more poisoned as this thing rooted itself inside him. 

Much later, I found myself in the learning room.

How many days? Enough to grow out my hair, which tickled my face under Mrs Blinky’s head. Even the Mayor's son was at peace, and yet his thoughts sounded and tasted and smelled like putrid slime I could sense drowning him. The static in our mind joined us, my body jerking backward and forwards, warmth seeping from my nose. My wrists were strapped down, my furry costume suffocating me. This time it felt more permanent, glued to me like I was part of it. “Very good!” 

Mrs. Blinky herself stood in front of showing television screen, and I wondered how long we had been there, mixing with the static and noise rattling inside our heads.  It wasn't the witch woman who took us. It was her, an amalgamation of buzzing static and colors collapsing into beautiful noise bleeding into me. I didn't have to be scared anymore. There was a reason why I was chosen at five years old. I was going to help her bring us all home. 

“Can they bring my children back to me?" 

"They're not there yet," A familiar voice hummed. He spoke through a cigarette between his lips. "Hannah and Jonas are far away. It's not like reaching a child who is on this plain. It will take practise and more tests– and even then, they are growing weaker with every broadcast. If we push too hard, they will start to pop like grapes, and we'll both lose."

"Then we need more!"

The cartoon spoke through the woman's lips, stretching them into a grin, and I found myself nodding because it was easy. It was easy to reach out and leech myself onto an unsuspecting mind. I heard the voice of the little girl, and just like I was taught, I slowly coaxed her through flickering noise, dragging her mind toward her television set.

The little girl appeared with curious eyes peering into the static we were made up of. “You’re not Bluey.”

We spoke as one, the frequency rattling through us, our voices tangled with the cartoon static of our original characters.

“Hello, Katerina.”

“Are you inside the TV?”

We smiled. “Can you go a mission for us?"

“Okay!”  

"We need your older brother Zach."

The girl nodded. "What else do you want me to do?" 

I was aware of the lights above us exploding around us as the signal carried our voices, bleeding directly into little Katerina’s head.

“Keep.”

I coughed, my eyes flickering.

Mr. Mean's voice erupted into my thoughts, when I started the wavy lines in front of me grew thicker and more tangled.

*Following vivid hallucinations lulling the mind into a false sense of security, the brain will start to break down, an intracranial hemorrhage will occur, and then death.*

Behind me, Tootles’s replacement toppled off of her chair, her body shuddering. Our voices joined the frequency as the thing that had connected us as kids took hold of the little girl. Unlike us, she did not cry out and slam her hands over her ears. She leaned closer, her eyes becoming rapidly moving spirals bringing her closer and closer to us. 

“Watch…ing.” 

If you want to know how we escaped, the mayor's son was in the possession of something which would later play a role in saving us. 

But, like I said in my first post, we never should have been rescued.
