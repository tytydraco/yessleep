A lot of rumors are circling area 51 with it being a secret holding area for aliens from other galaxies, I recently found out the truth and I wish it were something as easy to understand as aliens.

Quick recap, I graduated with honors and became a scientist working for the U.S Government, I was recently given a very large promotion and posted working with what can only be described as 'entities' in Area 51, Nevada.

I had always known about the low-level stuff kept there for testing, such as skinwalkers. I wish I were never shown what I would be working with.

I remember it vividly, it was the morning of July 18th, 1987, I had woken up to the phone ringing and had a gut feeling something was wrong; when I picked up, my supervisor informed me about what I would be working with the same day, I was originally excited, but the true horrors of what I witnessed will always stay with me.

I drove through the infamous gates and into the underground testing area, my supervisor led me to a hidden area I had never seen before, just walking through the corridors, you could hear what I can only describe as screams trying to sound human, I had worked with skinwalkers before but this was nothing like that, these screams sounded like true horror, something nobody should ever hear.

We walked down and after what felt like 3 years, we finally reached the containment area.  
Upon seeing whatever the fuck that was, I passed straight out, all I remember was it was covered in blood and must've been around 9 feet tall with two scientists monitoring it through a two-way mirror. When I regained consciousness about 2-3 minutes later, I was still on the floor of that same corridor, I hurriedly picked myself up and looked deep into the same holding cell I had to see that 'thing' in. it was empty. Nothing.  
The other scientists must've noticed my blank stare and told me that cell was empty.  
What the fuck.

I carried on down that dreadful corridor and I witnessed more un-human demons being tortured, killed, and hurt in the most inhumane way possible

We finally arrived at a holding cell; I couldn't even describe what the hell was inside it, there were two of them, but they didn't look like any of the other 'things' I'd seen.

I sensed something was off about these two, they were so different from everything else, I went up for a closer look and whatever it was charged at the glass causing it to crack, I fell backward reaching into my blazer for my handgun but before I could even do that, the thing was pounding on the glass and the crack was growing bigger by each second, I looked around and everything was dark, none of the other scientists were there, nor my supervisor; just me, and two in-humane beings very quickly escaping containment.  
I managed to quickly regain my thoughts and reached for my gun, but when I drew it, the magazine was missing, even though just 10 minutes ago, I had loaded it. I was fucked.

I closed my eyes and started to pray a miracle would happen to save me, not even a second later, I heard a loud glass shatter and four gunshots, followed by the loudest scream I had ever heard, I clenched my hands over my ears until I felt an arm grab onto me; I was prepared for the worst, but when I opened my eyes, my supervisor was stood above me, gun in hand with three or four armed guards behind him with two officers dragging those demons into a new holding cell.

I was swiftly taken at gunpoint into an empty room where I was forced to sign a secrecy act, it read:

"Do not ever tell anybody what you just witnessed. We know your family, your address, and everything about you. Keep it silent."

I know I shouldn't be telling you this, but it's eating away inside me, I have to get it out, I can't let keep it with me forever.

I looked over at the news reporter, who most certainly did not believe my story, I had .hoped that out of the hundreds of thousands of viewers of the live TV would believe me.

I thought I was finally clear of this trauma until the studio lights cut off and four armed officers dragged me out of the room.
