I know I’m not supposed to talk about this.
I know what the NDAs said, what the interrogations implied, what the doctors whispered when they thought the drugs had put me under.


But silence is a kind of death, too. And after what I saw under that ice… I’ve already died once.


We were flown in on a blacked-out C-17, no transponder, no flight plan filed. Our briefing came mid-air. A satellite sweep had caught something that wasn’t supposed to exist—a geometric mass the size of a small city, buried under three miles of ice near the Antarctic plateau. Perfect angles. Perfect symmetry. Not natural. Not ours. And older than human civilization.


Command didn’t want curiosity.
They wanted containment.


Our team—Echo Meridian—had handled bioweapons, downed craft, deep-earth anomalies. But when they handed us the specialized gear—Faraday cloaks, neural dampeners, a thermal lance rated for exotic alloys—Corporal Rivas just muttered, “We’re not walking into a structure… we’re walking into a tomb.”


He was wrong.
Tombs stay dead.


We touched down on the ice shelf just as the sun dipped low enough to bleed into the horizon. The air was so dry and sharp it shredded your lungs from the inside. But the structure… it breathed. You could feel heat radiating from it. Not warmth—something more like body temperature. Like standing next to the flank of a sleeping animal.


We set up a perimeter. No radio signals penetrated its walls. No drone would fly within a hundred meters—compasses twitched, batteries drained like the thing was feeding on them.


The first sign that something was wrong came when our medic, Kaleo, scraped frost off the surface. The symbols beneath were not carved—they were moving. Twitching like muscle fibers beneath skin. They rearranged themselves as she stared.


She backed away, said they were responding to her heartbeat.


I wish we had listened.


We ran thermal scans. The structure wasn’t cold. It wasn’t hot. It was alive—processing energy, generating patterns in repeating cycles like a pulse.


Then came the knock.


Three slow impacts from the inside. Like something testing the walls.
We froze.
Nothing natural knocks like that.


Rivas radioed command. Static. Serrano tried the backup channel. Static. Even our internal short-range mics began to lag, half-second audio delays that made our own voices echo like they belonged to someone standing inches behind us.


We debated pulling out. But the structure decided for us.


A seam split open across its surface, vertically, smooth as a slit in the earth. The glow inside was… impossible. Colors that don’t exist, shimmering like liquid gas, forming shapes too fluid and too sharp at the same time.


Our orders said do not engage.
But orders collapse in the face of curiosity.


Serrano stepped inside first. He whispered, “It’s beautiful.” A second later, his voice repeated the same words behind us—same tone, same rhythm—but Serrano was still in front of us.


That was the moment I knew the mission was already dead.


Inside the chamber, the walls weren’t solid. They rippled like membranes stretched over machinery. Strange silhouettes pressed against them—elongated limbs, branching ribs, skulls shaped like tuning forks. They weren’t moving… the walls were moving them. Cycling through forms like memories being shuffled.


Kaleo approached one. The membrane thinned, and there was a flash—like two silhouettes merging. When she turned back to us, she smiled too wide, teeth too even, posture too still. Our Kaleo had a slight tremor in her hands from an old nerve injury. This one didn’t.


One by one, the others vanished into the chambers. Each time, a copy stepped back out—perfect replicas wearing expressions too calm for the hell around them.


When they turned toward me, smiling, whispering my name in overlapping voices…


I ran.


I don’t remember much of the escape. I remember the storm clawing at me. I remember hearing my team’s voices calling from the dark, each time sounding more like mine. I remember something pacing me beneath the ice, like the ground had developed its own heartbeat.


Eventually, a recovery team found me curled against a snowcat, half-conscious and raving. They called me the sole survivor. They handed me tea I couldn’t taste and blankets I couldn’t feel, and avoided meeting my eyes.


In the weeks after, I noticed things.
People would pause and stare at me like they weren’t sure I was real.
Doctors scanned my vitals and found two overlapping heart rhythms—one human, one undetermined.
My dreams were full of shifting walls and silhouettes tracing my outline from the inside.


And last night… last night proved what I already feared.


Motion alarm outside my cabin.
I checked the feed.


There I was, standing in the snow, wearing the same frost-burned gear I lost in the storm. Same scar on the cheek. Same breath—except it didn’t fog in the air. And when it looked up at the camera, its eyes reflected the same impossible aurora glow I saw inside that chamber.


It tapped the lens:


Knock.
Knock.
Knock.


A perfect mimic.
Waiting.
Watching.


I don’t know which of us is the real one.
But something ancient woke beneath that ice… and it learned us.
Copied us.
Improved us.


And it’s coming.
Every knock is another door opening.
And Antarctica was only the first.
