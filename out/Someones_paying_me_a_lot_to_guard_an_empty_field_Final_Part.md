“Amanda?” I asked, my voice a mix of fear and confusion. “What is this place? What the hell is going on?”


Amanda just smiled warmly, then started walking toward me. I felt a knot of unease in my stomach. At least the creatures were still on the other side of the bars, but Amanda was now standing right in front of me.


“I see you’ve ended up here too, Steve,” she said softly.


I just stared at her with a puzzled look. What do you mean, ‘too’?


“Why are you here?” she continued.


“I didn’t end up here,” I shot back immediately. “I came down on my own. The strange little kids showed me the way.”


Amanda’s eyes widened as if I’d just said something impossible, something she could hardly believe.


“Steve? You’re telling me you came here on your own? And the Company didn’t put you here?” she asked, stunned.


“Uh… yeah. But I still don’t understand what this is all about…”


Without another word, Amanda grabbed my arm and pulled me toward the staircase she’d been standing next to. I could barely keep up with her in the dark. She moved as if she knew every step by heart, where the cracks were, which boards were broken, and where not to place her foot so she wouldn’t slip.
I lit the way with my flashlight, struggling to follow her.


“Amanda, enough! What’s going on here? Where are we going?”


“You have to help us, Steve,” she said tensely. “Help us before it’s too late for you.”


I yanked my arm free from her grip and stopped dead on the stairs. Amanda turned back to me quickly from a few steps lower, looking more anxious than I’d ever seen her, like I was a stubborn kid refusing to go to school and she’d have to drag me there by force.


“You’re going to tell me everything you know, Amanda,” I said through clenched teeth, “or I’m not taking another step.”


Amanda walked ahead of me, a few steps above. I kept my flashlight trained on her. I didn’t trust her, not entirely. From the very start she had been friendly and kind, but the things she told me… they were hair-raising.

She claimed she didn’t know much herself, but she remembered the first time she came here. It was in 1848. Her father had been gravely ill, so Amanda went looking for medicinal herbs and wandered into a meadow. In that meadow, a man was camping—a sheriff. He tried to drive Amanda away, but she refused to leave, especially after the man’s behavior turned aggressive. The situation escalated until Amanda shot him.
That’s when everything turned into chaos. The man hadn’t been alone: strange figures grabbed Amanda, the same kind of soldiers I had seen the night Ed died. They held her down and dragged her deep into the corridors, then locked her away among things she could barely comprehend.
But Amanda didn’t stay in her cell. Whenever she fell asleep at night, she would wake up somewhere, and somewhen, else, no longer in the cell but back up in the forest clearing where the entrance was. According to her, the Company had been experimenting on her. Her job became tending to the meadow I had been assigned to guard. She had to be there at specific times, and if she wasn’t, she would always wake up somewhere else in the middle of the night.

That was the story she told me, but something about it felt off. The pieces didn’t quite fit. I was sure Amanda knew more than she was admitting, her “just another victim” act felt far too thin.


“Amanda?” I finally broke the long silence as we moved down the stairs.


“What is it, Steve?” she asked flatly.


“You still haven’t told me where we’re going,” I said, pushing for an answer.


“You’ll see soon enough, Steve,” she replied, her voice devoid of emotion. “But I think this place holds the key to everything.”


“What place?” I tried to coax more out of her.

“Wait,” she said sharply. “We’re almost there. Not far now.”


Amanda seemed to speed up on purpose. She bounded down the crumbling steps like she was light as air. I tried to keep my eyes on her without losing my footing, but I was clumsy, half watching her, half watching my steps.
It didn’t take long before I slipped.
I tumbled down hard, like a sack of bricks, the steps battering my body with each impact. Finally, I slammed into the bottom with a sickening thud. The last thing I felt was my head smashing against one of the steps along the way. Darkness swallowed everything, and I just lay there, unconscious.

Amanda was nowhere to be seen.


When I came to, my vision was blurry. I reached up to my temple, dried blood had matted my hair together. For a moment, I thought I’d never wake up again. In the darkness of the corridor, it was almost impossible to make out anything. My hand brushed against my flashlight lying on the floor—broken.


“Amanda?” I called into the darkness.


No answer came. Far down the hallway, a single flickering neon light glowed faintly, as if it was breathing its last.
I forced myself upright. My head throbbed, and a dizzy wave rolled over me, I must have tumbled at least twenty steps. This wretched place was going to kill me in the end.

I started moving slowly. Walking was difficult, so I kept to the wall for support. I didn’t want to linger near the staircase, Amanda’s disappearance didn’t bode well, and I wanted to get as far away from those rabbit-masked freaks as possible.
As I staggered deeper into the dark corridor, I saw something far ahead. A vivid blue glow shimmered in the distance, like the flash of an ambulance light. It was strangely inviting… and deeply unsettling.


“Amanda?” I called again, surprising myself with the sound of my own voice.


Still no answer, only the pulsing lure of that blue light ahead.
Slowly but steadily, I pressed on. The glow grew stronger at the end of the crumbling hallway. It began to sting my eyes, but I didn’t stop. Whatever this was, I was going to see it through.

When I stepped out of the corridor, I found myself in another vast chamber. Huge blue lamps lined the walls, casting their glow toward the center of the room, where a man hung suspended in the air.
He had a young, handsome face, but he dangled from the ceiling—thick wooden roots had pierced through his body, holding him aloft as though they were chains. He was asleep. It looked as if he was having the most peaceful dream of his life… in this torture chamber.


“Steve,” a woman’s voice spoke from behind me. “You have to help him.”


Amanda was there again. She stood in the darkness of the hallway, silently watching. Her eyes were fixed on the man hanging from the roots, there was almost a reverence in her gaze.


“Amanda,” I snapped, turning toward her. “What the hell is all this? I’m getting sick of these games.”


“Wait, Steve,” she said softly, retreating further into the shadowed corridor. “Please… help him. He has to wake up.”


“No!” I shot back, anger flaring. “Who is this man, Amanda? What is the Company? What the hell is going on here?!”


Amanda only slipped deeper into the shadows, as if avoiding the light from the blue lamps. I stood there swaying, head bloodied, in the middle of the room, while the man above me kept breathing peacefully, as if taking an afternoon nap.


“Steve…” Amanda began. “I’m asking you nicely…”


“You’d better start talking, or I’m gone.” I snapped angrily.


“Alright, Steve,” she said sadly. “Have it your way. I’ll tell you everything.That man up there… he’s the last fae,” she said simply.


I scoffed. I didn’t trust her anymore, and her stories were starting to lose any hold they had on me.


“The Company is an ancient organization,” Amanda continued, “created to keep the realm of the faeries separate from the world of humans. But over the years, they strayed from their purpose and began experimenting. They wiped out nearly all the faeries… except him. He was their leader. Now they keep him in a deep sleep so they can use him however they want. That’s how the rabbit-masked ones were created—half fae, half something horribly twisted.”


I listened, stunned. Maybe it was true… or maybe Amanda was lying again.


“Fine, let’s say I believe you,” I said, suspicion heavy in my voice. “Then what’s our role in all of this? Why does the Company need useless security guards like us? And what about all those tasks we had to do every single day?”


“I don’t know the full truth, Steve,” Amanda replied quickly. “But it has something to do with the leader’s dreams. A fae's dreams hold terrible power. Somehow, the Company uses you to keep those dreams under control, to maintain their hold over the meadow.”


“Ridiculous,” I muttered. “I’ve been afraid of some damn dreams? So my dead mother was just a dream too?”


“Steve, I really don’t know everything… Somehow his dreams draw from your consciousness too. I don’t fully understand it.” Her voice turned pleading. “But please, just do this one thing for me. Wake him up.”


“And what happens if I do?” I asked, glancing up at the man hanging from the ceiling.


“We’ll be free,” Amanda said softly but firmly.


Fine, I thought. If this is what I came all this way for, then let’s wake him. Let whatever’s coming, come.


I stood in the glow of the blue light, with no idea what I was doing or why. Maybe Amanda’s story held some truth… or maybe it was just another scripted act. I couldn’t decide.

Still, I stepped forward and gently shook the man’s arm.
His eyes snapped open and locked on mine. His whole presence was like something out of an old legend, sharp, chiseled features and eyes that were either a piercing blue or an icy grey. I just stood there, stunned, as if a character had stepped straight out of the pages of a book.
The roots impaling him seemed to release him all at once, sliding out of his flesh. He slowly descended to the floor, but his legs gave out before he could stand. He would’ve collapsed completely if I hadn’t caught him. He was surprisingly light—almost weightless—like holding a feather.


“Here, Steve!” Amanda’s voice called from the dark hallway. “The light’s no good for him!”


I led the man toward the corridor, where Amanda practically shoved me aside to take him from me. She handled him so gently it was like she’d found someone she thought she’d lost forever.


“I’m guessing he was more than just your leader,” I said bitterly, watching her.


“Thank you, Steve,” Amanda said, her voice breaking.


I just stood there, waiting for the explosion—for Company men to burst in, for soldiers to open fire, for at least some security system to trigger. But nothing happened. Only the dull hum of the big lamps filled the air.


“So what now, Amanda?” I finally asked.


“We leave,” she replied coldly.


And that’s exactly what we did. I followed them warily down the corridor. Amanda supported the man, who hadn’t spoken a single word. The rooms, the hallways, the staircases were all empty. Everything I’d been through—gone. No rabbit-mask ball, no Ben, no iron gate… not even the sunflower field. And then, suddenly, we were outside.
We were in the middle of the forest, exactly where the little boy had said goodbye to me that night—only now in the morning light, the three of us standing there.


“That’s it?” I asked, almost disappointed.


“Yes, Steve,” Amanda said, then turned to the man and spoke in a strange language, telling him to sit on a nearby stone.


“What about now?” I asked. “What happens to the Company? What about the meadow? This feels… too easy.”


Amanda smiled softly.


“Hasn’t it been hard enough already?” she asked gently. “Why can’t the ending be simple? I told you—if the leader wakes, everything will be fine. He’s the one who keeps it all in check.”


“Right, but… won’t the Company come after you? Or me?” I cut in.


“Don’t worry, Steve,” Amanda said calmly. “The Company exists across time and space. If they’re not using this leader, they’ll just take another from some other era… some other present. The point is, here and now, we’re free.”


I didn’t reply, just nodded. Maybe I understood… or maybe I just wanted to believe I did. Amanda helped the man to his feet, and together they started walking deeper into the forest.


“Oh, and Steve,” Amanda called back over her shoulder. “Don’t be afraid, we owe you one. If you ever need help, you know where to find us.”


The next moment, I was standing at the bus stop in the small town. Apparently, a bus ran from here back to the city. I’d never paid attention to how I’d gotten to the meadow, and now I didn’t care. When I walked past the spot where it had been, it was just an empty lot. The bus pulled up just then. Luckily, I always kept some change in my pocket, so I had enough for the fare. I climbed aboard—only to feel something strange. Like something wasn’t… real.


“Hey, Steve. Headed home?” the driver asked.


The blood froze in my veins. The driver was Ed. Tall, silver-haired Ed.


“Ed… you’re alive?” I asked, my voice shaking.


“I don’t know, Steve,” he said with a sly smirk. “Are you?”


Everything went black. Like a single frame in a film had changed—no bus, no passengers, no Ed, no sunlight, no small town.
Just the blue light again… and the smell of a damp cellar.
The man was hanging from the ceiling once more, roots spearing through his body.


“Steve, what are you doing?!” Amanda’s voice screamed. “Wake him up! Come on! Please!”


What the hell is happening?


“What? What is this, Amanda?” I asked, panic in my voice.


“What… what do you mean?” she replied, sounding just as confused.


“I woke him up! We were outside, we got out! You both left, I was going to go home… but Ed was there. And then… I’m here again! Back here! What the hell is going on?!” My voice cracked with panic.


It felt like my mind was starting to split apart. One moment I was standing at the bus stop, and the next I was right back here, as if nothing had happened.


“Calm down, Steve,” Amanda’s voice came from the dark. “Maybe it was just a vision. Standing before the fae leader, things like that can happen. But now… please, wake him up, and let’s get out of here.”


I couldn’t even put into words how I felt. It was as if reality itself had evaporated around me. As if someone had staged a film of me escaping and going home—when in truth, none of it had happened.
I just stood there beside the man bathed in blue light, hanging motionless from the roots. Without thinking, like a puppet, I stepped forward and gently shook his arm.
His eyes opened and locked on me. They were a beautiful, pale blue—or maybe a cold grey. The same image flashed through my mind as before. But this time, the roots didn’t let go. He just stared at me… then his face twisted in pain and he let out a scream of unbearable force.

Something was horribly wrong. It felt like I was being crushed by an invisible weight, or like I’d tried to surface too fast from the bottom of the ocean. My knees buckled, and I collapsed.
I tried to scream from the pain, but no sound came out. Instead, blood began to trickle from my nose, my ears, and even my eyes. The man’s scream filled the entire chamber; the walls seemed to tremble with the sound. I felt like I was about to be torn apart.


The next moment, I heard my own distorted scream—only my hands weren’t pressing against cold, crumbling concrete anymore, but soft grass. The blue glow was gone, replaced by the warm sunlight. I was outside. In the open. In a field.

Not just any field—the very same one I had been guarding days earlier. But now it was surrounded by a tall wire fence, and where I’d once driven in, there was a small wooden building. 
I wiped the blood from my face. My head throbbed, ready to burst.


“Jesus, are you all right?!” a man’s voice shouted. “How the hell did you get in there?”


A stocky, middle-aged man with a round beard stood on the other side of the fence. He didn’t wait for an answer—he ran into the little building, came back wearing a gas mask, opened the gate, and all but dragged me out.
He took me far away from the field, all the way to where I’d once parked my car.


“Are you okay?” he asked, tearing off the mask. “How did you get in there? No one’s allowed in!”


“I… I don’t… I don’t know,” I stammered. “Not allowed in where?”


“The field, kid,” he snapped. “Signs are posted everywhere! Some kind of gas seeps out there, and if you breathe it in, it does terrible things to your brain.”


“What kind of gas?” I asked suspiciously. “Are we safe here? Where’s Amanda?”


“I don’t know who Amanda is, but I hope she wasn’t in there with you. Either way, stay out of the field! It’s safe next to it, the gas stays inside. I’ve already called the extraction company; they’re sending people.”


A vehicle soon pulled up—its side read Taurus Gas Extraction. These men looked more like regular workers than scientists hellbent on world domination and imprisoning supernatural beings. 
But… how had I gotten here? Where was I really?
They drove me into the nearby town. Everything looked exactly as it always did whenever I passed through this place. They took me to a small clinic, where the doctor hurried over as soon as he saw me. My head was covered in blood, dried streaks marking my face.


“What happened to you?” he asked, startled.


“He went into the gas field,” one of the workers answered for me.


The doctor let out a sigh. Clearly, this wasn’t the first time he’d seen something like this.


“You’re lucky,” he said kindly. “That field is toxic. It eats away at the brain and causes hallucinations.”


“So… I hallucinated all of it?” I asked sarcastically.


“I don’t know what happened to you,” the doctor said with a faint smile, “but I do know one thing, Ben is very much dead.”


And everything went dark again. Like someone had spun a chair around in a pitch-black room—I was spinning, my stomach churning, my head swimming, with no sense of where I was.
When the world finally stopped, I was back in the blue-lit chamber.
It was quiet, and the air reeked of damp. The lamps hummed. The man still hung from the ceiling, the roots piercing through his body.


“Steve! What are you doing? Are you going to help us or not?!” Amanda’s voice shouted from the darkness of the hallway.


I just stood there, panting. My heart felt like it was going to explode out of my chest, my body drenched in sweat. I wanted out. I’d take the crappy corner-store job, or anything else, just let me get the hell out of here.
I need air.
No hesitation,I bolted toward the hallway like a man who’d completely lost his mind.


“Rot in hell, Steve!” Amanda screamed.


The moment I reached her, she leapt from her hiding spot like a cornered wildcat, lunging at me, claws out. She tried to sink them into me, but I didn’t let her. Panic and adrenaline tore through my body like wildfire.
We struggled. Amanda punched, kicked, even tried to bite me, while I used every ounce of strength I had to keep her away. Then, with a sudden shove, I forced her out of the hallway and into the blue light.
The moment the light touched her, Amanda began to shriek like a madwoman. She writhed and flailed as if her body had caught fire. Her skin glowed white, like burning phosphorus. I threw my hands over my eyes to keep from being blinded.


“Sir, please, you have to leave!” a man’s voice said.


I lowered my hands, but a flashlight beam blinded me again.


“Sir, you can’t stay here,” the man repeated.


“I… I don’t know… where am I?” I asked, shielding my face from the light.


“Well, I’m not exactly sure where here is either,” he said, “but you can’t stay.”


Finally, he lowered the flashlight, and my vision cleared. I was standing in the middle of the field. Only now the roles were reversed—I was the intruder, standing out here in the middle of the night, being told to leave—just like in the old reports.


“What time is it, kid?” I asked suddenly.


“Eleven thirty-five,” answered the young security guard—early twenties, crisp uniform. “But please, sir, you need to go.”


“I’m not going anywhere,” I growled, shoving past him.


I made for his car. I just wanted to vanish from here, I couldn’t take it anymore. But I’d barely taken a few steps when I heard his phone beep: a new message.


“What did they say? Let me see!” I barked, lunging at him.


I snatched the phone from his hand so fast he didn’t have time to react. I must have looked like a deranged vagrant—dirty, torn security uniform, bloodied head, and now mugging people for their phones.
The message was from a number I recognized—the Company’s.
“WARNING! LEAVE THE AREA IMMEDIATELY! A UNIT IS EN ROUTE FOR CLEANUP!”


“How long have you been working for them?” I demanded.


“Just a few weeks… but please, let me go. I don’t want any trouble!”


“Go,” I said, tossing the phone back. “And never come back here. This place is hell. You’ll end up like me.”


The kid clutched his phone and ran without another word. He had the same type of company car they’d given me when I first came here to work.
As I watched him run toward it, I saw them—figures in black, crouched beside the car, weapons trained on me.
A single gunshot—and blood erupted from my thigh, my chest, my shoulder all at once. I collapsed, screaming in pain, the sound of boots pounding the dry earth all around me.


“Stay on the ground!” someone shouted when I tried to move.


I lay in the dirt of the field, soldiers encircling me. One stepped forward and smashed the butt of his rifle into my head without mercy.


Darkness. The cold night air turned into the smell of damp rot. The stars vanished from the sky, replaced by a cracked concrete ceiling from which roots dangled. My wounds were gone.
And I was back—standing before the man hanging from the ceiling.


“Steve, what are you waiting for?!” Amanda’s voice echoed from the dark hallway.


“What’s happening here, Amanda?” I asked the woman wearily.


I felt awful. It wasn’t just my mind wearing down from these constant shifts—my body felt like it was starting to give up too. I knew I couldn’t last much longer.


“What’s happening to me, Amanda?” I asked, my voice breaking. “Why am I here for the fourth time?”


“I don’t know, Steve,” Amanda said, her voice trembling. “What happened?”


“Whether I wake him up or try to leave… I always end up back here,” I whispered.


Amanda didn’t reply, but I could see her face in the darkness. She looked tense, trying to make sense of what was going on, to understand what all of this could mean.


“Try to wake the leader, Steve,” she said after a moment.


“I’ve done it twice already,” I replied flatly.


“This time, do it differently,” she urged. “He’s the only one who might know what’s going on.”


I just shrugged. None of it made sense. Whatever I did, I always ended up back here, as if everything I’d gone through had never happened at all. So I simply shouted:


“Wake up!”


My voice echoed through the chamber. The man hanging from the ceiling opened his eyes, pale blue, and looked at me—but there was no kindness in his gaze this time. He looked at me like he wanted to kill me.
The roots didn’t release him completely, but they slowly lowered him down. He stepped onto the floor softly, almost weightlessly, just a few steps from me. Long strands of root still protruded from his body, swaying, as if they were moving him like a marionette on strings. He stepped closer, then in a flash his hand shot out and clamped around my throat.
With one hand he lifted me off the ground, choking me. I’d thought someone who moved that lightly couldn’t possibly be that strong—but his grip was merciless. I felt like my eyes were about to burst from their sockets. I thrashed, punched, kicked, but nothing worked. My vision began to fade, my eyes rolling upward, and then the darkness closed in completely.


“I see he’s waking up,” a woman’s voice said.


I opened my eyes and realized I was in a hospital room. Machines beeped around me, a neck brace locked my head in place, and I was lying in bed in a hospital gown. The room was spotless, orderly, and I was the only patient there. At the foot of my bed stood a neatly dressed, attractive, middle-aged woman. Blonde, curly hair. Bright red lipstick.


“Where… where am I?” I croaked. My mouth was completely dry.


“Steven, you’ve been in a coma for almost six months. And it’s our fault—the Company’s,” she said calmly.


“Excuse me?” I whispered. Even speaking was painful; my whole body ached as if it had been broken once.


“I’m Cintia,” she introduced herself, pulling a chair up to my bedside. “I’d like to apologize on behalf of the Company. The anomalies on the field became unstable during the high-difficulty shift, and unfortunately, we weren’t able to respond in time. But fortunately, you survived, and you’ll be compensated.”


“What? What is all this?” I groaned.


“Please, calm down, Steven,” she continued evenly. “Do you remember what happened?”


“Not… not really,” I muttered.


“You had an accident,” she began. “You and Ed were on an high-difficulty shift. The unit we sent to fix the anomaly’s malfunction was taken out by the creatures. So we asked you to retrieve the research data. You partly succeeded, but the anomalies intensified, and two company vehicles were destroyed. Ed… unfortunately, he died. You barely made it out alive. You had severe injuries, but a rescue team brought you here, to the Company’s private hospital. You’ve been in a coma for six months. You started waking up yesterday, and now you can speak.”


I didn’t answer. I just stared out the window. I didn’t believe a word of it. I was waiting for that blue light in the corner of my eye, for the smell of the damp basement, for Amanda’s voice. But nothing happened.


“Steven,” Cintia spoke again, “I know this has been hard on you, but your rehabilitation and recovery will be fully covered by the Company.”


“Ma’am…” I said slowly, calmly. “Is this real?”


She just looked at me strangely, suspiciously.


“Steven, get some rest. You’re safe now,” she said at last.


Then she started talking about legal matters: confidentiality, how I couldn’t tell anyone where I’d been for half a year. But I didn’t listen. I just kept staring out the window. Outside, the sun shone beautifully, and I could see the branches of a tree swaying in the wind. A calm, natural sight.
I stayed in bed until evening, ate, and was examined by a doctor. He said my vitals were good, that they’d get me back on my feet soon, then I’d receive my compensation and could even take a vacation. I just smiled at it all.


That night, I watched TV—I couldn’t even remember the last time I had. Dinner was incredible, like I hadn’t eaten real food in years. For the first time in a long while, I felt good, though the neck brace was unbearably tight, and sometimes the pain in my body was so bad I could have cried—probably from the surgeries. Luckily, the medication worked.
I lay in bed calmly, watching a nature documentary… when at the window, just beyond the tree, I saw something. An ambulance pulled into the parking lot. It turned on its blue lights, and they filled the room.
Maybe… this is what I dreamed as the blue room? The thought flashed through my mind.

But then it felt like the whole room spun around me. Darkness… then blue… darkness again… then blue. The smell of the damp basement hit me. The blue light stayed.
And I was standing there again. In front of the man hanging from the ceiling in the roots.

I screamed.


I screamed as I pounded my fists into the man. He only swung on the roots like a rag doll. When I punched him in the stomach, it was like hitting a wall, my knuckles split instantly, blood running down my hand. Sharp, stabbing pain shot through my fingers, and I was sure at least one bone had cracked, but I didn’t stop. I kept hitting, my blood smearing across the man’s bare abdomen.


“Steve, what the hell are you doing?!” Amanda’s voice finally rang out.


“Shut the hell up!” I yelled back, turning toward her. “I’m sick of this! I can’t take it anymore! I don’t want to be here again! I’m done!”


I turned back to hit the man again—but he was already standing right in front of me, face to face. No more roots. He wasn’t hanging from the ceiling. His pale blue eyes locked on mine.


“Steve, you’re just dreaming,” he said in a deep, refined voice. “You need to wake up.”


Then he pressed his index finger to my forehead. 
I collapsed like a sack of bricks, hitting the floor hard. My eyelids felt impossibly heavy, as if I were slipping into sleep. I closed them like a child being tucked in by his mother.


“What the hell are you doing here, Steve?!” a deep male voice barked.


I shot upright. I was in the storeroom of the convenience store. Sitting on a pile of boxes so crushed they’d probably been under me for hours—I must have been asleep for a long time.


“You know what, Steve? That’s it!” my boss shouted. “I’m done with you! You’ve been here for over a year, and you’re always sleeping on the job! If you’re not sleeping, you’re staring into space or babbling nonsense! If you’re on drugs, go to rehab, I don’t care, but you’re fired!”


“Wait, Berry!” I called after him as he headed for the door. “How long have I been working here?”


“Oh, come on, Steve, don’t start with your crap,” he groaned.


“Please… just tell me. Just answer this: how long, and where was I before this job?”


“Fine… about a year and a half here. Before that, you worked at a gas station. You’re a useless nobody who’s always daydreaming. Now get the hell out!” he snapped, then stormed out.


Just like that, I was out of a job. I stood outside in the street. The town was still asleep, the darkness pressing in. A police car sped by, blue lights flashing. The beam swept across me, making me squint. I braced myself for the spin, the damp basement smell, the blue chamber… but nothing happened. I just stood there.


“Steve, Berry fired you?” came a gentle female voice behind me.


I turned. Naomi stood in the store’s doorway—one of my now-former coworkers. Young, kind, pretty… but I’d never dared to make a move, always afraid she’d reject me.


“Yeah,” I said flatly. “But I’ve got more important things to deal with right now.”


“Alright,” she said sadly. “Steve… if you ever come back around, and you’ve pulled yourself together, drop by. Let’s talk for a bit.”


My first stop after leaving the store was home. I kept my eyes locked on anything blue—lights, signs, reflections—like a hunting dog on a scent. But nothing happened. I didn’t go back to the underground chamber. Nothing.
At home, I packed everything I thought I might need and tossed it in the car. I probably looked insane—and maybe I was. I had no idea what was happening. Was this reality? Or could I end up back in that chamber any second?
I hurried to the car, got in, and drove. I was going back to the field. I had to see it. I knew the way by heart. Nothing happened all the way to the small town, but when I reached the forest where I should have turned onto the dirt road… it simply wasn’t there. No matter which way I went in the early morning half-light, I couldn’t find it.
Finally, I left the car and went on foot. But the field wasn’t the way I remembered. There was no magic, no calm—just an ordinary field, overgrown with bushes, weeds, and bugs.
But I didn’t give up. There was no way I’d dreamed it all. No way the Company, the field, or the underground facility had never existed.


I spent days in that forest, searching every inch. There was nothing I’d seen before. No security guards in the field, no strange events. I combed through the woods but didn’t find a single staircase leading underground. No rabbit-masked people came at night, and Amanda never appeared.
Most importantly: I never went back to the blue chamber. Sometimes panic would hit me, the fear that I’d blink and find myself back in that damp basement… but no. It never happened.
Maybe I’d dreamed the whole thing. Maybe my mother’s death had broken something in my mind, and I couldn’t tell what was real anymore. But out there in the forest, I had time to think. To go over everything that had happened and ask myself: was it only a dream, or had I been given another chance?
In the end, I decided the world had gone back to its old, normal rhythm… and maybe I should too. So after about a week in the forest, I gathered my things and went home.


It was hard to slip back into everyday life. I felt like that whole dream had stolen years from me. Like I’d lived an entire other life… but no. Everything was the same. I had no choice—I had to keep up with the world again.
I got a job washing dishes at a restaurant. Crappy work, but at least the pay was better than the convenience store. On top of that, I started studying programming. I’d always been interested in it, and now I finally felt like I had the energy. I was making good progress. It was hard, but at least the struggle meant something.
One day on my way home, I found myself standing in front of my old workplace—the convenience store. Naomi was at the register, serving an elderly man. Poor girl was still stuck in that dump. Something came over me, and before I knew it, I was standing at the counter, asking her out.


Weeks, then months passed. Sometimes I thought about the field, about the Company… whether those days had been real. But it didn’t matter: I never went back to the blue chamber.
Years went by. Naomi and I were engaged, and I had never been happier. Programming paid off—I landed a good job. My life was on track. I had it all: success, love, peace.
My happiness only grew. Naomi was pregnant, our first child, a girl. She chose the name Maya, and I agreed instantly. It was a beautiful name. Maya grew fast—too fast. Before I knew it, she was six years old. Naomi was pregnant again, and I didn’t mind—especially since I’d just been promoted. We bought a beautiful house with a yard. I never thought I’d be this successful, but life had finally smiled on me.
Then came the day. Naomi went into labor. Thankfully, Maya was with my mother-in-law. The hospital called, telling me to come. I’d never hurry so fast in my life. I knew everything would be fine, but I wanted to be there.
And then it happened.
I didn’t watch the light, stepped into the street, and a car hit me. It was over in a flash. I was already lying on the ground when I opened my eyes. Someone screamed, a man shouted for help. I couldn’t move. I felt the heat of the asphalt against my back, stared up at the sky dotted with puffy white clouds… and then a man knelt beside me.
I recognized him by his pale blue eyes.


“Steve,” he said softly, “you’re still asleep. You need to wake up.”


I woke up screaming in the company car.


“Fuck! FUCK! GODDAMN IT!” I pounded on everything—the dashboard, the steering wheel, the door.


“Everything alright, Steve?” came a soft voice.


“Who—what the fuck—?” I whipped my head around.


The blue-eyed man was sitting in the back seat. He looked at me sadly. His bare chest was an unnatural shade of gray, and that’s when I noticed—I was back in the field. Morning light. I wasn’t a programmer, a happy family man—just a pathetic mess in a security guard uniform.


“I’m sorry, Steve,” he said sympathetically, “but you should have followed the rules.”


“What the fuck are you talking about, you bastard?!” I shouted.


“Tsk, Steven,” he said gently. “Maybe I overdid it with the last one… but that’s how it is.”


“What?” I hissed through clenched teeth.


“Look where you are,” he said, nodding toward the window. “This is where it all began, right?”


I didn’t answer—just nodded.


“Nothing began, Steve,” he said coldly. “You didn’t even make it through your first day.”


“What?!” I glared at him.


“Steve… there’s a rule in your handbook for a reason—never fall asleep. You fell asleep on your first day. We can’t resist the dreams of a sleeping man.”


“We?” I asked, confused.


“Don’t be stupid,” he growled. “Most of what you experienced wasn’t real. It was all a dreamscape. A nightmare I built for you.”


“You son of a bitch!” I roared, lunging to hit him.


But he stepped out of the car. Headed toward the field. I jumped out and ran after him.


“STOP, YOU FUCKING BASTARD!” I screamed.


“Steve,” he said calmly, “cool down.”


I reached him and slammed my fist into him. He didn’t even flinch. My fingers shattered instantly. I collapsed from the pain, clutching my hand.


“Steve,” he said again, calm as ever, “you’re boring me. We’ve played enough. This is your last chance. Leave. The car’s there, the Company will pay you. Go home, get a job, do whatever you want. You’ve seen that you can have a good life. Would you throw that away just to hit me again?”


“I’d beat the shit out of you,” I said, trembling with rage.


“It was good with you, Steve… but go home. I’m doing the same.”  The man just smiled.


And he walked toward the forest. I just stood there, watching him go. Then my phone rang. The Company’s number. I picked up.


“Steven, please leave the area or it’s all over. We’ve sent a car for you,” a woman’s voice said.


It sounded familiar.


“Amanda?” I asked.


A few seconds of silence. It was like she was talking to someone else in the background. Then she spoke again:


“Yes, Steve… it’s me. But how do you know my name?”
