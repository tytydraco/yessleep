I was 12 when this happened and forgot about it. So one night I woke to get a glass of water. My room was at the end of the hallway. As I walked, I noticed an open door in the hallway that was to the room that used to be my big sister Sophia's room before she moved out of the house. The room was pitch black, and I saw nothing in it even when I turned on the hall light. I went to the kitchen, got myself a glass of water, and walked back to the hallway. I saw that the same room was not pitch black anymore, and I could see the stuff in the room, but the room was a mess; there was stuff everywhere.

I did not think much of it. I drank the water and went to bed. The next night it happened again. I woke up hungry, wanting a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I went to the kitchen and made myself one. As I went back to the hallway, I saw that the door to my big sister's old room was open again; the room was pitch black. I saw nothing in there because it was pitch black even when I turned on the hall light. I heard some creepy low-pitched voice from that room, but the thing was I could not hear what it said. I went back to bed in my room, eating the peanut butter and jelly.

When I fell asleep that night, I had a very scary nightmare that I was looking at that doorway while it was pitch black. There was a demonic voice coming from the room. Walk on in the room with us, but there was also another voice telling me, "Don't do it, please don't do it!" The voice telling me not to do it was loud. In the dream I had this uneasy feeling looking at the pitch-black room in front of the doorway.

I woke up and had to pee very badly, so I went to the bathroom that was right next to the kitchen. After I got done, I was in the hallway again. I saw the pitch-black room again, but I made the dumbest decision out of curiosity: I went in the room. Let me tell you, I was a dumb butt when it came to curiosity. If something was dangerous and I was curious about it, I was going to do it.

When I went in, it was absolutely pitch black, and when I looked back, there was no light from the open door or hallway, even if the hallway light was on. I thought to myself, "Maybe the power went out." I began trying to feel around the room to see if there was a wall, but I could not feel the bed or wall. It felt like I was not in a small room but a big open place. I kept walking around, and still no wall or bed. I was getting scared and didn't know what the hell was going on. Maybe I was in a nightmare, so I pinched myself, and it hurt bad. I then felt a very painful pinch that was not me.

Now I was scared and tried to find my way out. As I was walking, I heard a scary sound that echoed as if I was in a big place; it sounded like a demonic growl. I don't know how I found my way out, but I finally felt a wall and found the doorway. I was finally out of that fucking place. I slammed the door shut and ran as fast as I could to my room and hid under the bed. I stayed up all night hiding under the bed.

My mom caught me hiding under the bed and told me to get out from under the bed. I told her that last night I thought there was a demon that was going to get me. My mom laughed and thought I had a nightmare.shut andI was 12 when this happened and forgot about it. So one night I woke to get a glass of water.
