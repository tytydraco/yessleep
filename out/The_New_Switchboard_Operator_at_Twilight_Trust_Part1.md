I stood outside Twilight Trust Banking and Financial Services. It was a building of medium size with a striking gothic structure that seemed a bit out of place given its remote location. Situated on the outskirts of the city, it took me over an hour’s drive to get here.

Not far off, a quiet cemetery added an unusual touch to the surroundings, its tombstones barely visible through a light mist, but not overwhelmingly so. The scattered buildings in the vicinity only helped to enhance the overall sense of seclusion.

As night began to fall, a chill settled in the air, causing me to rub my hands together for warmth. I could see my breath in the cold damp air, which only added to the eerie atmosphere of the place.

Thankfully, many birds chirped in the distance, their pleasant calls echoing softly as they added a touch of harmony to the landscape.

 Adjusting my tie, I took a deep breath, feeling a tinge of excitement and nervousness. Today marked my first day on the job and I really wanted to make a good first impression.

Work hasn’t been easy to come by off late, and when I received a call from the company regarding an opening for a switchboard operator, I immediately jumped at the chance.

The management found my resume online and believed that my previous experience as an operator made me an ideal candidate for this job.

One odd thing about this job though was the complete absence of any morning shifts.

Work began at 8 PM and continued until 5 AM, which seemed unusual since mornings are typically the busiest hours, especially for the financial industry.

Still, I couldn’t argue, given they were paying me much more than my previous job. They were offering $45 an hour, which made it the easiest 'yes' I've ever given.

To be honest, it felt like a real godsend.

As I approached the entrance of the bank, a guard at the doorway stood up from his desk and smiled at me, almost as if he was expecting to see me.

“Mr. Gavin Lockwood,” he said, beaming as he extended his hand. “Welcome to Twilight Trust.”

“I’m Mortimer,” he continued as I shook his hand. “I’ll be your point of contact for today. Don’t worry—I have all your details on file here, along with your photograph,” he said, pointing to a ledger on his desk.

Mortimer, in his late forties, was a thin, lanky figure with a faint musty odor that clung to him. His angular face, marked by yellow-stained teeth, deep-set eyes, and sunken cheeks, contributed to his oddly unsettling presence.

He also appeared a little disheveled, his trousers at least a couple of sizes too big, held in place only because of his utility belt.

“Let me show you inside and get you settled,” he finally added, as he turned around to escort me into the building.

When Mortimer opened the door, I found myself entering the lobby of the bank. The space was functional and straightforward, with clean tiled floors and plain colored walls.

A few potted plants were scattered around, and simple wooden desks lined the area. The lobby was sparsely populated, with only a handful of employees quietly working at their stations.

Mortimer next led me towards the elevator, and as we stepped inside, the first thing I noticed was a small circular mirror attached on one of the elevator walls, positioned at an angle that allowed people  to see behind them. It felt strangely out of place, as if it served a purpose beyond mere decoration.

“The ground floor, as you can see, is the bank’s lobby,” Mortimer began speaking again. He then pointed to the elevator’s number pad. “The first floor is the cafeteria and break room. You can also use this floor if you need to smoke, as there’s a designated smoking area here.”

“The customer support team is split between the 2nd and 3rd floors. You will be working on the third floor. Floors four and five are restricted and reserved for senior management only.”

“Is that understood?” he asked, looking at me.

I nodded silently in acknowledgment as Mortimer gave me a guided tour of the first floor. We then got back in the elevator to go directly to the 3rd floor, where I was supposed to work.

Having worked in customer support before, I expected to see a number of cubicles with people sitting in close proximity to each other.

However here, I noticed that the expansive hall had been divided into a series of smaller rooms, each separated by solid walls with a small glass window allowing passers-by to glance inside.

In every room, a customer support executive worked alone at their screen. Headphones on, and speaking into a microphone, they were absorbed in their tasks, oblivious to the occasional looks from the outside.

Mortimer then led me to the far end of the hall, where he opened the door to one of the offices and invited me inside. I presumed this would be my own office. Inside, a lady was already seated, and we immediately locked eyes. Her face revealed a mix of concern and relief upon seeing me.

“Mr. Lockwood, please meet Mrs. Patricia Malone, who is on her last day at work. You will be taking over from her today. Mrs Malone I trust you will help Mr. Lockwood to get acquainted with his new responsibilities and ensure a smooth transition?” he asked her, his face suddenly widening into a smile that showed more rotten teeth than any real warmth.

Patricia gave a slow nod and motioned for me to take the empty chair next to hers. She even managed a faint smile back at Mortimer as he prepared to leave.

Once he was out of earshot, she raised an eyebrow and gently nudged me in the arm and asked, "What took you so long? I thought you weren't going to show up today."

Mrs. Malone, who looked to be in her fifties, radiated a gentle, motherly charm. Her short, graying hair was neatly styled, and her glasses gave her a nurturing, comforting presence. Ideally I would have pictured her as a loving happy mother of two grown up kids. But I could see by her demeanor that she had been through some kind of stress recently.

“Oh, I’m sorry!” I replied, a bit taken back by the alarmed look on her face. “The guard, Mortimer, had me sign some paperwork and was showing me around the place. It took a little longer than I expected, I guess.”

Patricia let out a deep sigh of relief and nodded. For a moment, she subconsciously glanced at the wall behind her.

And I noticed it again—the mirror I had seen in the elevator. It was here too. Only this time, it was larger, oval-shaped and about the size of my forearm. A few inches below it was an antique cuckoo clock, its hands pointing at 8:00 AM. Clearly the clock had stopped running a while back.

As Patricia took a moment to prepare herself to brief me on my new job, I looked around the office to get a feel for the place. It appeared fairly typical.

A large desk occupied most of the room, with a computer at the center and a telephone beside it. Next to the phone was a small figurine and an old leather-bound journal. There was also a printer and a potted plant that seemed to complement the overall décor.

On one end of the room, near the clock, stood a life-sized filing cabinet. On the opposite wall just a few feet away from me, a framed photo displayed a fossilized insect encased in a ball of amber.

My thoughts were suddenly interrupted when Patricia’s voice cut through the air, bringing my attention back to her as she began explaining the work.

“Gavin, here we have a team of 40 customer support executives, each specializing in different areas of service. These representatives assist customers with their queries, ranging from managing savings accounts and processing credit card applications to handling personal loans or guiding clients through insurance policies. As an operator, your job is to ensure that each query is directed to the correct department for efficient resolution,” she said looking at me.

Patricia spent the next 10 minutes walking me through the process, explaining the key steps involved in handling calls while also giving me a rundown on how to use the PBX software installed on the computer system.

She then opened the drawer next to hers, and took out a notepad with a sheet of paper attached.

“Here is an important document that I want you to go through first. Please read it carefully to ensure you have understood every word in it. These are rules you need to follow to the ‘T’, Gavin. So make sure you read it right”

She handed me the notepad, her gaze steady and serious. I took it from her and started reading.

 

**Twilight Trust Rules and Regulation Manual**

Operators must, at all costs, refrain from using their real names while addressing customers during calls. For the duration of this employment, you have been assigned the name Ryan. Please stick to this name at all times.

Employees are not allowed to make personal phone calls on office premises.

Line 7 must always remain open. Contact should be established only in the most emergency circumstances.

Never respond to calls from blocked numbers. These numbers are usually highlighted in red and will immediately flash on your screen when the calls are made. Do not try and trace these calls.

No calls should be attended between 12:00 AM and 1:00 PM. This duration of time is known as the ‘Task Hour’. During this period, the system must be set to mute, and the operator should focus on the task provided. So, the operator is advised to complete attending to all calls by 11:55 PM so that he/she can be ready when Task Hour commences.

The details of the task will be updated in a leather-bound journal everyday. After the completion of the task, remove the document from the journal, sign it and file it away under your name in the filing cabinet.

 If a call is accidentally answered during the Task Hour, a timer will activate on your screen automatically. Continue speaking with the customer for the full duration of the timer. Do not disconnect the call prematurely, as doing so may result in serious consequences.

Your work at Twilight Trust is highly confidential, and details of the job should not be shared with outsiders or colleagues.

In addition to the above rules, there are certain rituals that you must adhere to religiously every day in the prescribed order before you start work. These are as follows:

1. Dust and clean your workstation at the start of each shift.
2. Place a glass of water next to the figurine positioned beside the screen. Turn the figurine towards you when you commence your shift, and turn it towards the system when you complete the shift.
3. Seal the door of your office room with a sprinkling of cinnamon powder.
4. A new pack of battery cells will be placed in your drawer every day. Please install it into the wall clock and reset the time at the start of each shift. Remove the battery and throw it into the dustbin at the end of the shift.
5. Use only the red cord provided to you with your real name printed on it. The cord should be connected and removed from the system at the start and end of each shift, respectively. Place the cord in a sealed bag after the completion of your shift so that it can be reused the next day.

If you agree to these guidelines, please sign the document along the dotted line below.

I signed the document quickly even as I thought some of the rules were a little bizarre.

I also realized the document had a little ceremonial component to it - when I turned the final page. It read -

‘Congratulations on becoming a Twilight Trust employee.

‘And now in keeping with our age-old tradition, please remove the portrait from the wall and hand it to the outgoing personnel as a token of appreciation on behalf of the company.’

As I turned to look at the framed portrait on the wall, I was surprised to see that the image had changed. It now depicted a stunning butterfly with its wings spread wide.

When I presented it to Patricia, I noticed tears streaming down her face. She thanked me and drew me into a warm hug.

 As she held me close, she whispered in my ear, "Gavin, please follow the rules. If you ever see Mortimer snooping around your office, double-check to ensure that you’ve followed the rules properly, ok?”    

I silently nodded, though I couldn’t help but feel a little spooked for the first time in the entire day.  

She then scrambled to collect her things, and offered me a brief but hopeful smile before hurrying out of the office for good.

As soon as she was out of sight, my eyes immediately darted to the mirror on the wall, compelling me to take a closer look. It appeared normal enough, but a nagging suspicion crept in— I couldn’t shake the thought that it might be a two-way mirror, the kind used in police interrogations, where observers can watch from the other side without being noticed.

But that also seemed unlikely since the mirror was mounted high up on the wall, almost touching the ceiling, yet angled perfectly to reflect anyone sitting in the chair below. So the next best guess would be to assume that a hidden camera might be installed inside. And that did make sense, given all this 'Task Hour' business they were so keen on.

Personally, I just hoped they wouldn't make me do something awkward or clownish and broadcast it across the internet. I sighed deeply and began setting up my new workspace according to the guidelines in the document.

I dusted and cleaned the area, filled a glass with water and placed it in front of the figurine, which I had already positioned to face me. The figurine resembled a middle-aged man with a thick mustache and a sharply tailored suit, presumably the bank’s founder.

I next installed a fresh pair of batteries in the clock, setting the time to the present.  I removed  the red cord from its packing paper and found my name ‘G.Lockwood’ already embossed on it. I replaced the old cord with the new one, and secured it to the system. Finally, I sprinkled a little cinnamon powder around the doorway.

Once I had completed all the rituals, I slowly eased into my seat and let my eyes wander around the room. But my mind for some reason still lingered on Patricia’s hasty goodbye.

“What have you gotten yourself into, Gavin?” I wondered aloud, “Is this place more than what it seems?”

A part of me wanted to get up and leave, but the lure of a paycheck kept me glued to the seat. I really really needed the money.

And then at the very moment, I saw the familiar notification of an incoming call pop up on screen - my first one at this company.

My eyes immediately darted to the time piece on the wall. The clock had just struck 8:00PM

I shook off my doubts, slipped on the headphones, and answered the call.

“Welcome to Twilight Trust, this is Ryan. How may I assist you today?” I asked into the microphone

There was a pause on the other end, followed by a cold, distant chuckle. The person’s voice was low and raspy, like dry leaves rustling in the wind. “Ah, Ryan, it’s a pleasure to finally speak with someone from your esteemed company.”

I forced a smile, even as I felt a slight unease growing in my chest. “I’m glad to hear that, sir. How can I assist you today?”

“I wanted to simply extend my gratitude,” the voice continued, each word dripping with an eerie satisfaction.

“Your company’s service is truly unmatched. The loan I received has allowed me to settle an old debt.”

“I’m happy to hear that, sir. Here at Twilight Trust, we always strive to keep our customers satisfied” I replied.

“That’s true… very true,” the person on the other end agreed, his voice clicking slightly as if he were nodding in agreement.

“If you don’t mind me asking…. how exactly did we help you?” I asked, unable to restrain my curiosity.

The voice on the other end gave a slow, chilling laugh. “Oh Ryan! Let’s just say, what I couldn’t achieve in a very long time, your company made it possible today. It was exactly the shot in the arm I needed ... to help face an old acquaintance of mine.”

”Someone… who had wronged me!!”

A cold sweat began to form on my forehead as the implications of his words began to sink in. “I... I’m glad we could help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Perhaps I can patch you through to one of our agents?”

“No, no, that will be all,” the voice replied, now almost a whisper.

“Just know, Ryan, that your efforts are deeply appreciated. Without your... contribution, I wouldn’t have been able to complete my task. I’ll be sure to spread the word about Twilight Trust. After all, others like me could certainly benefit from your services.”

The line went dead before I could put in another word.

For a moment I removed my headset and leaned back in my seat wondering what on earth was going on here.

“What did the caller mean by ‘he was wronged by someone’? And what did the company do exactly to remedy that situation?” I asked myself.

“Is this a place that specializes in contract for hire?”

“Is this a company that indulges in criminal activity?”

As my mind raced through possibilities, each more unsettling than the last, I saw another call notification pop up on screen. Even my mobile phone buzzed in my pocket at the same time as well.

When I retrieved my phone, I realized my account had just been credited with a $10,000 joining bonus from Twilight Trust.

My heart began to race away in my chest, as a wave of anxiety and excitement both surged through me.

And right then, as if being drawn by some inexplicable force, my eyes slowly but reluctantly darted towards the mirror on the wall, which now seemed to be taking on a dark shade of gray..

I couldn’t really tell right then if my eyes were playing tricks on me or not, but I nevertheless put on my headphones and proceeded to answer the next call.

“Welcome to Twilight Trust, this is Ryan. How may I assist you today?”

A middle-aged man with a husky voice responded, “Hi, I’m looking to get a new insurance policy for my family. It’s just the three of us—myself, my wife, and our young son.”

“Of course, sir. I’d be happy to help with that,” I replied, pulling up the relevant details. “Are you looking for a specific type of coverage?”

“Something comprehensive,” he said, his voice steady but tired. “We’ve had a few health scares recently, and I just want to make sure we’re all covered.”

“I completely understand, sir. I’ll go ahead and connect you with our health insurance specialists. They’ll be able to provide you with the best options for your family.”

“Thank you, I appreciate that,” the man replied,

“Please hold while I transfer you,” I said, before patching the call through to the correct department.

And so it went for the next couple of hours, running like clockwork, with everything beginning to slowly fall into place.

With each routine call, I found myself starting to relax, the tension from that first unsettling encounter gradually fading away with time.

“See, that wasn’t so bad,” I said to myself. “Just another normal day at work, like anywhere else. Nothing sinister going on here. Everything is normal. I’ve got this.” I concluded, taking a deep breath and letting my own reassuring words settle in.

Although, every once in a while I couldn’t  help but glance at the mirror on the wall, which, by this point, had turned a light shade of blue.

After taking a few more calls, I stretched my limbs and glanced at the clock. It was already 11:00 PM. Feeling the fatigue of the evening, I decided it was time for a break. I keyed in the system to log my status as "On Break", and notified the support team so that someone else could take over until I returned.

On my way to the cafeteria, I logged into my banking app on my phone just to make sure the $10,000 bonus was reflected on my account. Sure enough, it was there, confirming the unexpected windfall.

I had never seen so much money in my life, and I was mighty thrilled to say the least.

As I entered the cafeteria, the scene felt oddly muted. The room was dimly lit, with soft overhead lights casting a pale glow on the surroundings.

About half a dozen people of various ages were seated at small tables, eating in near silence, their eyes glued to their screens. Conversation was minimal, with only the occasional murmur or acknowledgment as patrons came and went. The only bright spot was the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingling with the faint scent of toasted sandwiches.

Even in the designated smoking area, individuals puffed away in solitude preferring silence over workplace banter. As I saw the smoke curling away upwards, I saw the mirrors installed here as well. In fact they were up on nearly every wall, reflecting subdued shades of colors.

Once I had my coffee, I eventually made my way back to my office and got back to work. As the clock eventually ticked towards 11:55 PM, I set my handset down and muted the system.

When midnight finally arrived, a wooden cuckoo bird emerged from its home, flapping its wings emitting a series of mechanical "cuckoo" sounds, which rang through the office with a rhythmic echo.

I slowly opened the leather journal wondering what kind of task was in store for me and began reading.

Hello Gavin

Great going so far!

 Please read the text below out loud in a clear and steady voice. Feel free to laugh if something amuses you.

You are also welcome to make changes to the text or add your own little contributions by using  your own vivid imagination.

 

“Ok here goes,” I said to myself and I started reading out loud as I heard my voice echo all through the room.

 

·        Why did Mozart kill all of his chickens? When he asked them who the best composer was, they all replied, "Bach, Bach, Bach."

 

·        What is the most difficult part about eating a vegetable? The Wheelchair, of course

 

·        Why do orphans not play baseball? Because they don’t know where home is.

 

·        My elderly relatives liked to tease me at weddings, saying, “You’ll be next!” They soon stopped though, once I started doing the same to them at funerals.

 

·        Did you hear about the guy who got his left side chopped off? Well, He’s all right now!

 

And so it went on for the next half hour where I slowly read out each joke. I must say I found it a weird yet funny experience.

And once this exercise was completed, I moved to the second task where I was required to write an event about my life that made me sad.  But here I was required to be honest and forthright about the experience. So I started writing about an incident that happened in Aspen.

 

*Mom and Dad were getting ready to ski down the hill one last time. It was our final day in Colorado before we were set to catch our flight back home. I had just been accepted into an Ivy League school, and my parents wanted to celebrate it with an impromptu vacation.*

*As they put on their goggles for one last run, I was sitting in the warmth of a nearby café looking through a large glass window while holding my 1-year-old brother Kevin in one arm and a camera in the other. My 6-year-old sister Kylie sat beside me. Dad had insisted I take a picture when he crossed the finish line, confident he’d win their little contest.*

*Suddenly, Kylie tugged at my leg, and I was startled to see her in tears. “Five minus one,” she repeated over and over, tears streaming down her face.*

*I stood there, paralyzed in shock. This was the first time I had ever heard Kylie speak. She had always been a strange child, sitting in silence for hours while playing with her doll all by herself. That was a normal day for her.*

*Mom and Dad visited every doctor they could find, desperate to hear her speak, but she would  just rock back and forth in silence. The doctors all gave her a clean bill of health, saying speech delays were common, but it never reassured them.*

*One time, when Kylie was four, Mom tried teaching her math. “What’s five minus one, Kylie?” she asked. Kylie silently counted on her fingers and held up four.*

*“Just call me Mom once,” she begged, but Kylie stayed silent, continuing to play with her doll. That moment finally broke Mom’s heart, and she never asked Kylie to speak again, though she never stopped caring for her.*

*As I struggled to make sense of Kylie's words, I saw Mom looking at the two of us from where she stood. Though mom couldn’t have heard what Kylie said, she could clearly see her daughter trying to speak to me. And she started slowly walking toward us looking concerned and curious, while Dad looked back puzzled.*

*Just then, the ground began to shake. A massive avalanche thundered down the hill, sweeping up the skiers, including Dad. Mom was spared the full impact as she had come closer to the café but was still caught in the cascading snow and dragged downhill.*

*By the time the rescue team found Dad, he was already gone. Mom, though still alive, was gravely injured. We spent months in the hospital, and I gave up my dream of college so that I could use the money to take care of her bills. Mom never recovered though, and her heart eventually gave out, leaving me to care for Kylie and Kevin alone.*

*It’s been eight years since the incident, and my family has endured its share of challenges, but we've continued to hold our heads high. Kylie, now 14, is maturing into a thoughtful and sensitive young woman. She speaks more freely now, expressing herself in ways we never imagined. Kevin, at 9, has found his place on the swimming team and is thriving. As for me, I’m doing my best to be the brother they need and can depend on.*

 

After finishing writing, I signed the document and walked over to the cabinet to file it away. When I opened one of the drawers, I saw hundreds of neatly arranged files, each belonging to various employees, all organized alphabetically.

My folder was filed under ‘L’ for Lockwood. I retrieved it, carefully placed my first completed document inside, and returned it to its spot. I noticed that I only had access to my own file; the rest were locked and inaccessible.

With the ‘Task Hour’ handled, I got back to my regular job as a switchboard operator. I spent the next few hours busy on the phone as calls came and went. One thing I had to look out for was calls from blocked numbers. These people dialed in at random, and I had to stay vigilant to avoid answering them.

Another curious aspect was that Line 7 was always active, and I couldn’t help but wonder what the story behind it was. However, I left it alone and stuck to the rules. Things were going smoothly, and I appreciated the peace that came with it.

As I finally finished my shift for the first day, I carefully carried out the end part of the rituals which included sealing the red cord in a bag. When I switched off the lights to my cabin, my gaze automatically gravitated towards the mirror on the wall which continued to emit a faint blue glow.

I closed the door and walked across the corridor to the elevator. As soon as I pressed the button for the ground floor, the lights began to flicker. Suddenly, the elevator dropped abruptly, then jerked upward, like a bottle in free fall being yanked by the rope it was tethered to.

The violent motion caused me to crash to the floor. In a state of panic, I watched as the elevator continued its erratic descent towards each floor, plummeting first and then being sharply pulled back up by its cables.

By the time it reached the ground floor, the elevator had jerked three times, leaving me crumpled on the floor in complete darkness, with only a faint, deep gold glow emanating from the mirror. I quickly staggered out of the elevator, barely managing to pick myself up. Every second in there felt like it could have been my last.

Throughout the ordeal, the people working at their desks on the ground floor didn't so much as glance up to see if I was alright. They carried on with their tasks undisturbed, as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. I took a deep breath, opened the entrance door, and stepped out into the cold night air.

“I hope you had a good first day, Mr. Lockwood,” Mortimer’s voice suddenly chimed in from his desk outside the building.

One look at my face, and he quickly realized what had happened.

“Oh, is it the elevator? I am sorry, I should have warned you. It’s an old building Mr Lockwood, and every once in a while the ride can get a little bumpy. Don’t worry, it's safe otherwise and you will get used to it,” he added, breaking into a smile that offered anything but comfort.

I simply nodded in response, but made a mental note to stick to the stairs from now on. I got into my car and began the hour-long drive back to the city. By the time I reached home, I was exhausted, and dawn was just beginning to break.
