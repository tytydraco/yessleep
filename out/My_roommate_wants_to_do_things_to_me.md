I moved to LA on a whim. I had never let go of my childhood dream of becoming an actor and thought, if I was ever going to make it, it was now or never. Stupid decision. But anyway, that’s not the point of the story.

LA is expensive as hell. I didn’t have a job yet and only $500 in my bank account. How was I going to find a place to stay? It should have been impossible, but hey, I got lucky (or so I thought): I replied to a post in a Facebook group—a UCLA student was looking for a roommate for their three-bedroom apartment. I sent her an honest message about my situation and, miraculously, Joanna liked me. In hindsight, she understood that only a desperate bum like me would be willing to stay in that real-life haunted house, but back then, I just thought she liked me.

To be fair, I hadn’t gone on Craigslist offering myself up to random crazies… it was a legit Facebook group, a legit Facebook post, and a legit Facebook person with hundreds of friends, photos, etc.

The apartment was super cute and it sat right in the middle of Brentwood, one of the nicest areas of LA. Rent: $400/month, utilities included. Man, I don’t know what I was thinking. I guess I was so naïve to the harsh realities of this city that I believed I had charmed my way into a deal too-good-to-be-true-but-actually-true.

I would share the apartment with Joanna, a third-year med student at UCLA, and Shruti, a computer technician who had recently immigrated from India. Joanna was super friendly and seemed to have a good head on her shoulders. We hit it off right away. Shruti, on the other hand, was… weird? The thing is, I didn’t actually see Shruti.

The day I moved in, Joanna knocked on Shruti’s door to introduce me. There was no response from the other side, but Joanna kept standing there, waiting.

“Maybe she’s not in,” I said.

“She is in. She is always in,” was Joanna’s ominous response.

Sure enough, after a few minutes, Shruti cracked the door open—just a couple of inches. She was shrouded in darkness, and a pungent odor wafted out of the opening. It smelled like food and stale air. I couldn’t make out Shruti’s features—only the whites of her eyes.

“Hey Shruti,” Joanna chirped, unfazed. “This is our new roommate, Bradley.”

I waved awkwardly. The dark silhouette uttered a low grunt, then slammed the door in our faces. As we moved away, Joanna put her hand around my shoulders and whispered, “Don’t let it affect you. Shruti is a lone wolf, but she’s harmless.”

I was weirded out, but I shrugged it off. In that beautiful, clean, sun-bathed apartment, Shruti’s room was only a dark corner I could pretend not to see. Looking back now, the most terrifying thing about that place was exactly the fake serenity—the daily pretending that everything was just fine.

At first, I was excited about being in LA: the sun, the ocean, the palm trees, the Hollywood glamour… But LA is a distressing city, and it has a way of letting you know that very quickly—sun, ocean, palm trees, and Hollywood glamour notwithstanding. I got myself a frustrating retail job that paid like crap, and I signed up for an acting class full of self-absorbed individuals who dreamt of glory and fame. After a few days, I was already panicking about my total lack of significance in this world.

Thankfully, I got along well with Joanna. As a medical student, she kept herself far away from the entertainment madness. She was a grounded young woman on a mission, with a busy schedule and plenty of friends. In fact, I was a bit jealous of how fulfilled she seemed in her life. I also resented her for never introducing me to any of the smiling faces that sprinkled her social media pages. I thought she felt superior to me—and rightly so. She was a cool LA girl. I was a sorry wannabe actress from the middle of nowhere.

Despite my negative feelings, I was also grateful for her. She was a warm presence who welcomed me when I came home. The only person who gave me any attention, really. When we crossed paths in the living room, we would always sit and chat, forcing ourselves to ignore Shruti’s closed door and whatever was going on behind it.

After a couple of weeks living at the apartment, however, I did ask Joanna how it was possible that I had never seen Shruti. Did she ever come out of her bedroom?

Joanna shrugged. “Not really, at least not when people are around. She works remotely for some IT company.”

“Does she have any friends?”

Joanna burst out laughing. I started laughing too. Two mean girls making fun of their weird roommate. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t funny.

Not long after, things got scary.

Joanna had suggested we take a day trip to Big Bear Lake. We spent a wonderful day immersed in nature. I felt that Joanna and I finally connected on a deeper level. I opened up to her about how lonely I felt in LA. Joanna was very supportive—originally from Canada, she had moved to LA for her studies and had struggled to adjust to her new environment. So she understood. She was also more open about Shruti. According to her, Shruti had a severe mental illness. Joanna would have preferred a different roommate, but Shruti was an undocumented immigrant and Joanna didn’t want to ruin her life by throwing her out of the house. That made sense.

I went to sleep happy that night. I woke up terrified.

It was about 3 a.m. when I found myself awake in my bed, eyes wide open, dread worming its way through my body. It wasn’t the fear of a specific threat, but rather the intuition that something terrible, something depraved, was about to happen—I just didn’t know what. That’s when I heard a deep moan from the other side of the door, followed by the scratching of nails against the wood. I lay still, praying thunderously in my head that I had not forgotten to lock the door.

The sounds stopped. I kept staring at the door, shadows dancing across my eyes, until wakefulness and sleep merged into each other.

When I woke up again in the morning, I told myself I’d had a lucid nightmare. Or sleep paralysis. Whatever it’s called. But as I left the room, I saw a mark on the outside of my door—a half-circle drawn in a deep red color.

I tried to wipe it off, to no avail. You can imagine how unsettled I was. I spoke to Joanna about it right away. She wasn’t as surprised as I thought she would be. Instead, she lowered her eyes, embarrassed. “Well, as I said, Shruti has a severe mental illness. Sometimes she’ll come out of her room at night and do odd things... Just stay in your room and ignore it. You’ll be fine.”

I felt angry. Joanna should have told me about Shruti before I moved in. Clearly, this person had more serious issues than just being a recluse. At the same time, $400 a month for that apartment was an unbeatable deal. Finding another place to stay would be really hard, given the state of my finances. So I decided to stick with it—and lock my door every night.

For a few days, all was quiet. I was a little tense in the evening when I went to bed, but eventually, I slipped back into my usual routine. Joanna and I kept hanging out a lot, just the two of us, and I got over the anger I felt towards her. After all, she was also in a tough spot: if she had been too honest about Shruti, people would not have wanted to rent the room.

I had a big monologue performance coming up at acting school, which I was very nervous about. Joanna helped me prepare for it. I discovered she had excellent acting instincts. Thanks to her support, I felt confident in my own voice and the performance went down wonderfully. After class, a girl came up to me to congratulate me. It was pretty much the first proper conversation I’d had with someone at school.

As it turned out, Emma and I had a lot in common. She was also from a small town in the Midwest and eager to meet new people in LA. We decided we’d go on a hike together to the Hollywood sign.

That night, while we were eating dinner, I asked Joanna if she wanted to join us.

Joanna’s eyes shot up. “Join you and who?”

“Emma, this girl I met in class. I think you’ll love her.”

“But I thought I was your favorite person.”

Time stood still. What did she just say? I didn’t know how to respond. I held Joanna’s gaze, trying to gauge whether she was being serious or not. She looked dead serious, ruthless even… until she started to laugh. I laughed too, and we moved on to a different subject.

A little while later, we were cleaning up the kitchen together. I made a joke; she smiled. As I turned my back to her, I caught her reflection in the dark windowpane. Her expression had changed abruptly. She was staring at me from behind, her face contorted into a grimace of pure loathing. I swiveled around—and there she was, smiling again. The usual, lovely Joanna.

What a strange evening… Surely, my mind was playing tricks on me. Joanna was a friend. She wasn’t perfect, of course, and maybe a little jealous, but that only proved that she truly cared about me.

However, before going to sleep, I dragged the dresser (the heaviest piece of furniture in my room) against the door. Just to be safe. I ended up staying awake for hours, monitoring the door like a sentinel. Eventually, sleep overcame me. As I was roaming the shadowy halls of Morpheus, I heard a guttural moan. I did not know if it came from the real world or from the depths of my mind. And again, that blood-curdling nail scratching sound. I told myself to wake up—I needed to fight, defend my territory, protect myself! But I couldn’t. I was trapped in the fumes of dark dreams.

When I finally woke up, the sun had risen. It looked like an ordinary morning, with birds chirping and cars driving by. But I was drenched in a cold sweat. I shot from my bed and dragged the dresser away from the door. The first thing I saw were scratches all over the side of the dresser that had been against the door, as if someone had been pushing madly to get inside.

Even before I opened the door, I knew there would be a message for me on the other side. Remember that red half-circle that had appeared a couple of days earlier? During the night, the drawing had been extended into a huge, bleeding heart. Right in the middle of it was my name, “Bradley.”

At that point, I think I switched to survival mode. When I came across Joanna in the kitchen, I didn’t mention anything that had happened. I just wished her good morning. Yet, she was the Joanna I saw every morning, making coffee on the fly, her UCLA med student badge hanging around her neck. Her eyes bore into me with genuine concern. Despite my efforts to act casual, I was extremely tense, and she clocked it right away.

“Is everything okay?” she asked.

“Yeah, I just have a bit of a headache.”

“Awww. I’ll get you something from CVS before I come home tonight.”

She placed a hand on my arm. It felt cold and clammy, like a fish hanging on to my skin. Revulsion vibrated through me. So what did I do? I hugged her. I didn’t even think about it—my body moved of its own accord, the same way your hands shoot forward when you fall down. As I held her in my arms, I smelled her fruity perfume, the one she always wore—but also something else underneath it: a sour odor, harsher than the smell of sweat. It was the smell of fear.

When I let go of her, I saw a flash of suspicion glinting in her eyes.

I didn’t quite realize how stiff my body had been until Joanna shut the door behind her. I stood still for a few more minutes, listening to her steps bouncing down the stairs, her car turning on and driving away, and finally… silence. When I was sure she was gone, my muscles almost melted in relief.

Then my mind did a full U-turn. What was I going on about? Joanna had shown me nothing but kindness ever since I had gotten here. She was a great person by all measurable standards. If I had to make a list of my LA friends, hers would be the only name to come up. That Emma girl? I barely knew her. And if there was an insane person in this house, it was clearly Shruti.

I knocked forcefully on Shruti’s door, determined to confront her. She opened the door right away. I instinctively recoiled. Instead of hiding like last time, she showed herself fully: a bony figure with elongated limbs and huge eyes. *The eyes of a hunted animal hiding in a hole*, I thought.

I intended to say something along the lines of: \*“\*What do you want from me? Stop bothering me or else..!”

I couldn’t. My mouth went dry.

She spoke first. “Did you figure it out yet?”

“W-what do you mean?” I stammered.

“Come in.”

Shruti dived back into the semi-darkness of her stinky room, beckoning me to follow. My mind told me to get the hell away from there, but my feet decided to drag me forward. As my eyes adjusted to the low lighting, a realization hit me. This was just a room. It was messy, kind of dirty… but how many young people’s rooms look like that? There was actually nothing odd about it.

Then I turned around and saw it: the wall where the door was, the wall that separated the room from the rest of the apartment, was covered in red graffiti. They depicted eyes, their wide pupils burning through me.

I let out a small cry and was about to run away when Shruti put a hand on my shoulder. For some reason, it felt incredibly calming.

“Don’t worry, it’s for protection.”

“Protection from what?!” I cried out.

“From her.”

She handed me a stack of papers. I leafed through them rapidly. They all depicted the same thing: Joanna’s UCLA medical badge. Multiple iterations, some neat-looking, some wonky, where the Photoshopping was obvious.

“I searched the bin,” Shruti explained. “Med school is a new thing. Before that, she was in law school. Before that, she was a successful film producer. That one was harder to pull off.”

My head started spinning. “What’s the meaning of this?”

Shruti sighed. “Come look.”

She pulled up Joanna’s Instagram account on her laptop and flicked through the photos. Photos of Joanna with groups of friends on the UCLA campus, on Venice Beach, on Hollywood Walk of Fame… normal social media photos I had seen before but never thought much about.

“What do you notice?”

“What do I notice?”

“Observe the faces of the people in these photos.”

I looked closely and I did notice something. Their smiles looked either a little forced, or a little too wide, like they were making fun of something… and Joanna always stood slightly apart from the rest of the group.

“Well, they all seem a little… uncomfortable.”

“Right. Look again.”

She flicked through the photos, back and forth. It finally clicked. *Not a single face appeared twice*. They were all different people in every photo.

“Does she just…?”

“Yeah, she just goes up to people on the street and asks them to take pictures with her. Her whole life is fake. *She* is fake.”

A mix of emotions bubbled up inside me: shock, fear, anger, shame… Weirdly, shame was the one that rose to the top.

“Who is she?”

“I don’t know. I only know she is very dangerous.”

Shruti grabbed my wrist and held it tightly.

“Listen to me,” she said. “The only way to protect yourself from her is to give her nothing. That’s why I hide in here all day. If she senses that you are willing to be her friend, even in the slightest, she will eat you alive. She craves love, and she can never get enough of it.”

“Eat you alive? What do you mean?” I whined, trying to pull my wrist away from Shruti’s grip. She would not let go.

She shook her head, as if to indicate that she didn’t want to answer the question. “It is too late for you. You have already let her in. Way too much. The only thing you can do now is run.”

Her voice turned into a shriek. **“RUN!”**

She released my wrist and I bolted out of there. Her shrill cry resonated in my head like an explosion of needles. I threw my stuff haphazardly in a bag and got in my car. As I drove away, I thought I spotted a familiar face staring at me from a coffee shop near the apartment. I wasn’t sure of it, but for miles I kept feeling like someone was watching me.

Right now, I’m sitting on Emma’s couch. I told her my roommate was acting crazy and asked if I could crash at her place for a while. She said yes, but she didn’t seem too enthusiastic about it. More like she was too polite to say no. I’m afraid I’m going to overstay my welcome very quickly.

My bank account is in the red. I’m not sure where to go. I keep thinking about calling Joanna. At least I know she would pick up. She always does.

Then I push that thought away. The whole reason I escaped that apartment is her.

Did I really have to do that, though? What was I afraid of, really?

It’s like two people are arguing in my head.

Oh god. Joanna is calling me. Should I pick up?

I kind of want to.

I miss her.
