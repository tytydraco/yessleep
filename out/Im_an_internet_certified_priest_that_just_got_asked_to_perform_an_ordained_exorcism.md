Becoming a priest was never supposed to be serious, I wasn't even religious. I literally took an online course and paid the fee because I thought it would be funny to say "oh by the way guys, did I tell you I became a priest?" 

Then I would continue living my life as normal because it was just a joke. A prank, on God. I thought it was clever and ridiculous and I didn't think in a million years anyone would take me seriously. Let alone ask me to perform an exorcism.

I did the course in 3 weeks, and it only took that long because I didn't take it seriously in any way, I forgot I was even doing it for a couple days.

But when I finished the process I couldn't wait to tell my friends. I ordered a rosary cross on Amazon, ya know the necklace with beads on it.

I got a black button up shirt and the white collar, then I put on my favorite jacket and met the guys at the bar. 

When we got to our table with our drinks I couldn't have been more eager. I proposed a toast, which everyone thought was odd. I saw them glance at each other before holding their drinks up a little, waiting for me to say a few words.

Instead, I grabbed the rosary from my pocket, unzipped my hoody quickly, pulled it down below my shoulders and while they gasped and shook their heads in amazement I said what I had spent days memorizing for this very moment.

"Blessed are you, Lord, all-powerful God, who in Christ, the living booze of salvation, blessed and transformed us. Grant that, when we are sprinkled with these beverages or make use of it, we will be refreshed inwardly by the power of the Holy Spirit and continue to walk in the new life we received at baptism. Amen"

They were floored and equally as excited in laughing at it as I was.
They were quick to comment on it.

"Nooooo did you actually do that?"

"Pretend to be a priest, Believe it or not, straight to hell."

"Ya know wearing a costume doesn't make you a priest."


"Oh I know!" I replied immediately "but paying twenty-five dollars to the state of Georgia does indeed.... make me a priest."

"Are you serious?"

"Drink your legally holy Coors light, yes I am dead serious." I said back.

We cheered with a clinking of our glasses and drank our legitimately blessed beers and I am telling you THAT is as far as this was meant to go. I had no intention of helping anyone, I didn't want to save souls, I was not a real priest!

Except I was.

We enjoyed it thoroughly that night,  I must have blessed three random peoples drinks who either laughed or rolled their eyes. I did make the urinal water holy as I was using it so I'm not sure if the water was blessed or my urine was...

But you see my point,  the purpose of the joke. It was just a prank. Something I never should have done.

A few weeks went by and I mostly forgot I had ever been ordained, the collar was hung up in my closet and nobody was about to ask me to perform any marriages so I had no reason to think about it. Until the knock at my door Thursday evening.

I looked up from my work laptop. I had hardly ever gotten knocks at my door. I despised unannounced guests and my friends knew that. 
Maintenance had come by once before to fix the leaky sink but that was an expected visit. This knock was not. 

It came again, three knocks quickly.

I stood from my desk and walked toward the door, while calling out. 
"Who is it?"

Almost immediately they replied.
"My name is Father Donovan, are you Connor Gale?" He asked quickly.

I hadn't put any connection together, as I said it had been a couple weeks since I last mentioned my priesthood.
So I looked through the peephole and saw a man with a white collar, standing close to the door on the other side while nervously fidgeting with his hands.

I unlocked the door and opened it. He took a tiny step back and stopped wringing his hands.

"Yeah I'm Connor, can I help you?" I asked, half expecting this to be some weird door to door donation program I was already prepared to decline. 

The man held his hand out.
"Father Gale, I know this is unorthodox and unexpected but I'm finding myself in a truly unorthodox and unexpected position, normally I wouldn't come to someone outside of the church but I needed to, I didn't have a choice. I-"

I held up my hand and stopped him. 
"Woah, take it easy, I have no idea what you're talking about." I said honestly.

The man nodded once and took a breath.
"You are Father Connor Gale yes? 342 Norbook drive. Apartment 17."

I felt my eyebrows rise as I realized what he was saying. 
"Oh, yes. Uh... yeah that's me."

He sighed relief. "Please, we don't have much time, you are desperately needed."

I looked past him, down the hall, toward the parking lot. He turned his head curiously and followed my gaze. Then I looked at him.

"Todd put you up to this?" I asked, smiling 

"What? No? I don't know Todd." He said quickly. "Please, I'll explain everything on the way."

"You know I'm not like a priest priest right, I'm not like... " I gestured to him.  "You,  I'm like..." I gestured to myself, with my black track pants and white drop tail T-shirt. "Me. Ya know? Like you're Googles priest, I'm like Bing... or yahoo even."

"Father, I am aware of your credentials, and in a situation like this believe me I would go to another if I could, but I don't have anyone else. And in the eyes of christ, right now you are as much of a priest as I am. Now please, I am begging you to act on your faith and come with me before we are too late." He said, exasperated, out of breath, out of hope.

There was a solid chance this was one of my friends pranking me. But I decided to roll with it and see how it played out... I now wish of course i had never gone anywhere with Father Donovan. 

I fetched my wallet, keys and phone from my room, started to go back to the door, then returned to my room and grabbed my priest collar from my closest, just in case. Then left my apartment, locking the door behind me. 
The priest, the realer one,  hurried to his car.

I hesitated, looking at his car then mine a few spots away.

"So should I follow you? Or..."

"It would be easier to ride with me, please. We have to hurry, we really don't have time-"

"Yeah Yeah I get it, our holy top secret mission." I said back, annoyed at his urgency and my lack of information. 

We loaded into his vehicle, and I immediately was sure he was not an actor.
There was a cross hanging from the mirror, a weathered Bible on the seat, the car smelled like a church if that makes sense, and the radio was some sort of Christian talk show. It was too on the nose to be faked.

He reversed from the parking spot and we started our journey.

"Alright you've got me in the car, what are we doing?" I asked, I looked at him and could see sweat beads on his forehead, a disheartening look on his face and part of me felt bad for him and whatever situation he was in. 

"We aren't doing anything... you are." He replied nervously, as if he was afraid to say it.

I raised my eyebrows "I am, okay what am I doing?"

"You... you're, well... I don't really know an easier way to tell you this."

"Just say it. "

"Its not something one just blurts out, it's a process, of vital importance and, and faith, and authority. "

"Just tell me what it is Jesus christ."

This made him look away from the road, he wasn't angry, he just looked at me and seemed to take me in, measure me. Then he shook his head and stopped at the light.

"You're going to perform an exorcism."

"Ha, okay" I laughed, but he looked at me again, with sincerity and hopelessness, no,  maybe that's the wrong word, desperate hope is a better description.

"An exorcism? Me, perform one? You know I'm not actually a priest, I got certified online. I don't even own a Bible. They sent me one, and do know where it is? Because I have no idea."

"I told you it's unorthodox." He said softly, accelerating when the light turned green.

"Its not unorthodox, it's insane, it's... it's like asking an Uber driver to do Nascar. Actually it's not, the Uber driver at least knows how to drive, no this is like asking an actor to do brain surgery because they play a doctor on TV. They're not really a doctor, I'm not really a priest!"

"Look I know this is a lot to take in, but you ARE a priest. You're certified and endorsed by the church and state, how do you think I found you?" He asked, I could tell he was starting to feel pressured.

He slowed the vehicle down as we entered the church parking lot, which was nearly full with about twenty or so vehicles, but I didn't let this observation distract me from what was going on. 

"Because it's a prank, this is a prank. You've got cameras hidden and I'm going to be on YouTube or tiktok or something." I said defiantly. 

"It's not a prank. You'll see, listen to me Father Gale-"

"Connor." I corrected, but he just looked back at me with an almost blank look. 

"When we go inside,  you're going to see things that will frighten you,  you're going to be tempted to converse with this demon, it will say or do anything to stop the exorcism."

"No! Stop. Where are the real people that do this!?" I demanded, feeling the panic of this bizarre situation set in. 

"They're... inside." He said slowly.

"Then get them! I don't know why you'd drive six miles to get me!" I nearly yelled.

"I can't help them! You and I are all that's left! If we can't stop it, many many lives will be ruined, and wasted." 

I stared at him,  he was genuine, he was afraid. He noticed my realization and he leaned back in his seat, he took a deep breath in and exhaled slowly while holding onto the steering wheel.

"There is no one else that can do this. We have the child inside the church, and they cannot get out... yet. I need you,  God calls upon us when we least expect it, he called Abraham the liar, Elijah who ran away, David the lustful... God has used flawed people, worse people than a doubtful priest, and now he is calling upon you to fulfill your duties." Father Donovan said calmly, his voice became more reassuring as he used the gospel to persuade me.

"I'm not a real priest." I said again. 

"Which is why I need you. You are a priest, but you're not... one of us. I believe this will be your greatest weapon against the demon."

"How!?" I demanded, thoroughly confused.

"This demon... seems to feed off the faith of others, the stronger your faith the more angry and powerful the demon becomes. With you... maybe it will lower its guard."

"Maybe." I echoed.

He just looked at me with a thin and weak smile, then exited the car.

I thought about sitting there, just refusing to play into the joke, refusing to engage the insane.

But I was curious, if this priest was right and a demon was waiting for me, thats what he'd say while preparing the next guy,  he would say Abraham the liar, Elijah the coward, David the lustful and Connor the curious. Oh not familiar with him? He's the great value priest splattered all over the walls.

I stepped out of the car, regretfully.
"What am I supposed to do?"

"Get the Demons name. Once we have that we can begin the exorcism." He said to me before he turned and headed to the church.

I made a pained face, closed the car door and followed him up the short steps that led to the entrance. 

We stopped at the threshold. Father Donovan removed a key from his pocket and with shaky hands he unlocked the door of the church. 

The first thing I noticed was the smell.

I gagged and felt the smell penetrate my lungs, it felt like I had sprayed the inside of my throat with mold, ash, and something rotting. 

I instinctively took a step back and waved the putrid air in front of my face.

Father Donovan winced but stepped inside, against my better judgement I followed him. Once we were through, he turned and pulled the door to close it. 
I looked at the old door and felt like running back into the fresh air, running back into the sunlight and open sky away from this place that felt and smelled like anything but a church, but it didn't matter what I wanted to do since the door closed with me inside. 

The priest then locked the door with a resounding click that somehow felt exaggerated, resolute, in a way that made me immediately wonder if it was going to ever unlock again. 

I was scared, and I hadn't even seen anything yet. 

We turned back to face the inside of the Holy building, we were only in the foyer so all I could see was another set of closed doors ahead with small silver bowls that sat empty on pedestals posted on either side, a bathroom to my right and left, and a desk with various literature spread across it in messy piles, some of which had been scattered on the dark red carpet below.

"Beyond this vestibule lies the nave..." Said Father Donovan before he stopped and noticed my confused look. "The pews, where the congregation sits during Mass..."

I nodded once, holding my hand just below my nostrils in a vain attempt to block the odor. He continued.

"The nave is... well, I don't know how to brace you for what it has become." He said slowly in a faltering voice.

"Really you've done such a good job explaining things so far." I snapped back. He looked up at me and I saw the truth in his eyes, he was scared, nervous, afraid, truly out of his depth with whatever was happening in this church.
"I'm sorry... where is everyone else? Shouldn't there be more priests here if whatever is happening is bad enough that you came and got me?"

He looked sorrowfully at the doors ahead and spoke in a flat voice.
"They're inside, in the pews... all of them. But they're gone. Do not look to them for guidance, only look to God, Father Gale when we enter the nave it is imperative that you do not look at them. Do not let your eyes wander, look at the floor, look to the cross, and if you do look elsewhere... do not let them see your eyes."

"What will happen?" I asked automatically. 

"When I arrived here a day ago with my clergy there were seven of us." He replied. "They looked upon the possessed and became possessed themselves."

I felt my stomach twist into a knot. Father Donovan stepped forward to the door and looked at me once more. I nodded once and looked down at the floor.
He opened the door and the smell burst outwards, it was so fierce I felt my eyes water, I covered my mouth and kept my eyes down. I locked onto Father Donovans shoes as he took the first step inwards.

That first step is when I heard the whispers. All of them saying different things at different times it was like an orchestra of whispers, my ears tried to pickup a single word but it was impossible.
Father Donovan continued to walk, slowly leading me deeper into the church. I watched the carpet turn from dark red to a lighter shade, a soft red.

"What are they saying?" I asked, muffled through my hand that was covering my nose from the putrid smell.

"They are reciting prayer." He said back in a quiet voice. 

"I can't understand any of them."

"They are speaking backwards." He replied.

Chils ran across my arms like wisps of smoke.

One step at a time we walked on the soft red carpet that led from the foyer to the altar.

Slowly and carefully I looked beyond Father Donovan's shoes. I saw the shoes and legs of others in the pews. Dozens of them, I was so afraid that somehow one of them would be lying down waiting to lock eyes with me that I let out a short gasp and looked up at the ceiling.
The recessed lights were dim, the roof had large beams of wood, a nice chandelier hung well beyond reach, but it was hard to look up while walking, so I closed my eyes and looked down, then opened them and followed his heels with my eyes.

Father Donovan led me through the aisle until he stopped. I froze, panicked but too cautious to look ahead. 

"What is it?" I asked quickly.

"The demon is looking at me. Glorious St. Michael, prince of the heavenly hosts, who stands always ready to give assistance to the people of God; who fought with the dragon, the old serpent, and cast him-"

"No!" Screamed a voice that made me step back, made Father Donovan stop his prayer.
The voice was high, strained and shrill almost like a shriek.

The church was silent immediately. 

"I-I cannot go any closer, it would only anger and strengthen the demon." He whispered while standing in front of me. "You must go forward alone."

"What!?" I demanded.

"You must. If I were to join you it would only give the demon more power. It feeds off of faith. This is why we were powerless to stop it. The priests of this church brought it here to weaken it, but they only gave it strength. Strength it used against them. If you're to have any chance against this demon I cannot join you at the altar." The priest explained.

"What do you expect me to do? An exorcism wasn't exactly part of the required reading!?" I said to his back, he turned slowly and knelt down to look up at me, into my eyes.

"I'm going to help you, I will provide you the tools necessary, and I will walk you through this."

"I'm not a real priest!" I said, a mantra that I repeated as if those were words of power when really they were useless to say.

Father Donovan stood, I kept my gaze locked on his eyes, he set his hands on my shoulders.
"That is why it has to be you."

"Damnit.... Damnit okay what do I do?" I asked him. 

He looked relieved for the first time.
"You can approach the demon, you can look at it. But remember it is a liar, it will try to manipulate you and use everything it can against you. You must learn it's name first, then we will exorcise it from the host. I will bring the tools needed and walk you through the rest. No matter what happens, do not look at those who whisper, if you're not looking at the demon, look only at the ground. If you hear my voice telling you it's safe to look anywhere else you must not believe me, only in the vestibule is it safe to look around. Do you understand?"

"I think so, yeah."

Father Donovan closed his eyes.
"Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle; be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray: and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God, thrust into hell satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen."

"Amen" I said.
"Amen" said dozens of voices at once.

The priest opened his eyes they were sad and nervous.
The chorus of voices sent shivers down my arms, it was only a word, a sacred word even... but it felt so wrong just then.
"I want to believe that was our fellow priests offering their strength to us, but I know it is only the demon taunting us." He said in a hushed voice. 
I felt whatever courage I had mustered begin to wither away.
But he continued,
"You must get the Demons name. And remember do not look to me from your place on the Altar, you must not let any of them look at your eyes or they will cast a spell on you like they did the rest of the church, When I see your body turn back to me, I will guide you back with my voice. " He explained.

"Okay." I said simply, then he turned to the side to let me pass.

I kept my eyes lowered and walked, until I was in between him and the altar, then when I was certain there were no more pews in that direction I looked ahead, and felt more confused than ever.

A young woman sat candidly on what appeared to be a stone table, she sat cross legged with her hands underneath her chin and her elbows resting on her thighs.

Thick ropes were tied to her wrists, ropes that looked dark and damp like they had been pulled from water as if they had possibly held a small boat to a dock or something, but of course nothing like that was around.

This was the demon? This woman that appeared to be my age if not younger, wearing an outfit that probably matched six other women in a four block radius.
She noticed me studying her and she asked,
"Who are you? Whats your name?"

Her voice was genuinely curious and incredibly normal, nothing like what you see or hear in movies.

I wanted to look back to the priest for guidance but fought the urge.
"Uhm... tell me yours first." I blurted out. 

"You're not a priest are you?" She asked, uncrossing her legs and swapping the one over the other before crossing them again almost in boredom.

"Tell me your name... uh,  Demon." I said, struggling to find any confidence at all, hesitating to even look at her.

She waved her hand up and down as if saying bye,
"Yeah, sure bud, wait... you're not a priest, right? Like you look like the other guy just grabbed you off the street. Do you even go to this church?" She asked. 

"No." I replied, immediately noticing the demon raising its, or her? Eyebrows. "I mean no,  I'm not a priest, or... I am but No I don't go to church."

"So you are a priest that doesn't go to church? Or you're not a priest and you don't go to church? I'm confused on why you're here. I mean I know why I'm here." The demon raised her bound wrists. "That moron thinks I'm possessed and apparently-" She put her hands around her mouth and yelled "HE HAS NO IDEA I AM LITERALLY GOING TO SUE HIM FOR KIDNAPPING ME!"


It was a trick. It had to be. Because this was a demon in a young woman's body. Messing with me, she seemed playful and bored more than anything. Irritated sure but not exactly in a panic as you'd expect a young tired up woman to be.

"What's your name?" I pressed.

"It's Michelle, and I don't know what crazy show you guys are putting on but people are going to start looking for me. So let me go, and I'll just be on my way from... wherever we are."

"You don't know where we are?" I asked. 

"No,  that asshole put a pillowcase or something over my head when he kidnapped me, he's crazy, you know that right?" She sounded so genuine. 
Then she smiled at me,.
"Just let me go, please. He's not around, untie me."

I shook my head, seeing through the temptations, through the soft voice and innocent demeanor.
"You're not Michelle. You're a Demon, what is YOUR name Demon?"

I felt so stupid. Like I was in the process of applying my clown face makeup the more I made the one request.

"Listen dipshit, do I look like a Demon!?" She snapped, throwing her hands out as wide as the ropes would let her, which wasn't far.

I stared at her, studied her, she looked weird tied to a table, but currently... she kind of just looked like some girl that had been kidnapped. And maybe she had been, maybe they made a mistake...

I stared at the floor, letting confusion wash over me, then I turned and slowly made my way back the direction I had just come from.

"Oh awesome, no you go ahead, I'll just wait here until he sends another weirdo." She said angrily. "And open a window! It smells like shit in here."

I walked alone to the space where I had first left Father Donovan, the room was silent, a little chilly but not cold. I wanted to look around for him but I knew I couldn't. So I called out. 

"Heyyo... uh, Father."

"I'm right here, come this way." He replied.

I turned to his voice,  then froze, looking down at my feet, at the carpet. I could see that he was calling to me from a different direction than the vestibule we had spoken in earlier.

"Uh..." I said out loud. Unsure if this was another trick, or if he had gone to a different room to get the supplies he had mentioned. 
"Uhm, let's meet back at that foyer, the saferoom... thingy."

"Yes of course, do NOT look around, don't look up until you get there, the carpet will be different. Do you remember it?"

"Yeah." I said simply, and slowly I walked between the pews until I was at the doorway and saw the dark red carpet again. I walked fully into the room and took a deep breathe.

"I closed the door, it's alright now." He said.

He almost got me, I almost turned, I had rotated my head and my shoulders before snapping back to how I was, facing away from the nave I had come from.

"I didn't hear the door." I said firmly.

The door opened, and closed loudly and clearly.
"It is closed, I assure you,  but you are right to be cautious. Here, walk backwards and reach behind you until you feel the door. Use your hand to see that it is closed."

It made sense, so I did. When I was certain, I turned and looked at him. 
He was holding a book and a small cross on rosary beads.

"How do you know she's a demon?" I asked bluntly. I crossed my arms and leaned against the door.

"It is a demon. Something powerful. Did you see the ropes? We had to soak the rope in holy water just to hold it down long enough to bind her to the table."

"Her?" I echoed, perhaps too harshly.

The priest looked at me curiously.
"Her body, the young woman this demon is masquerading as. Father Gale you must trust me when I tell you that what you see, is a demon. It is a servant of the devil, powerful enough to fill the pews of this church with corpses it uses to mock us. Did you not hear them? Did you not hear it cry out when we approached it?"

I thought about it, I had heard the whispers, the chorus of Amen when we had finished our prayer of protection, and I had heard the scream when we first went to the girl... to the demon.

"Yeah, I heard them... I just, I'm not cut out for this alright,  let's call the police! They'll take her into custody, see that she's possessed and take care of it."

"The demon would use its lies like camouflage. The police would only see a woman bound, and the demon would escape. We can't let that happen." He said quickly, confidently.
He took a step forward and held out the rosary beads and the book.
"Take these, I recovered them from the office and was on my way back when you called to me. The cross is to be worn around your neck, and the book,  here look see this? I've bookmarked what you will read to the demon now that you have its name."

I raised my eyebrows. 
"Oh, about that... it didn't tell me it's name. It told me hers. Said her name was Michelle... I'm guessing that's not the Demons real name."

He looked broken, lost, like I had just come home from getting dinner and forgot to bring the food back with me.
"Father Gale, the longer this takes the more at risk we become. It is imperative you get the Demons name so that we may use it to cast the evil out."
.
.
.
So I returned to the girl, the demon, and asked again. 

"Your name. Tell me your name." I said calmly.

"Listen, this isn't funny anymore, this isn't okay. Let me go now and I won't tell the cops you kidnapped me, but you can't keep me here forever!"

Her playful attitude was gone. Her curious grin was gone. Now she looked messy and anxious.
She tugged at the ropes.

"You were so calm just a bit ago." I said.

"I'm calm. See, look" She sat still and smiled weakly. "If I'm calm will you let me go?"

"Prove to me you're not a demon." I suggested, taking a slight step towards her.

She leaned back from me.
"How the fuck would I do that? You prove you're not a demon!" She barked at me.

"I'm wearing a cross." I said confidently, holding up the rosary and cross I had just been given. 

"So am I!" She said immediately, she raised up her left wrist to show a small silver bracelet with a cross holding the ends together. 

I felt stunned, confused and doubtful. 
"That... that's something. Recite scripture?" I offered.

"I don't know any off the top of my head, hand me a Bible and I'll read the whole damn thing if I have to."

I looked around the small area, careful not to look back in the direction of the pews where apparently all the members of the congregation had been made to sit... and if I looked at them, I'd join them...

Finally I saw a Bible that appeared to have fallen to the floor. I scooped it up and handed it to her.

She tried, but her reach was cut short from the ropes.

I looked at her wrist, it looked bad, like it had been rubbed raw... or maybe burned, burned with the Holy water it had been soaked in.

Cautiously, I reached out further and handed her the Bible.
She took it, opened it immediately and read out loud.

"For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.... whatever the hell that means, will you let me go now?"

She closed the book and tossed it to me, I caught it barely and stared at her.

"You're... not a demon." I took a bold step close to her, close enough that she shifted away from me.
"You need to tell me what is going on."

"You!? You're with him!"

"No I'm not,  he showed up at my door telling me I needed to perform an exorcism because everyone else was dead or something!"

She stared at me, wide eyed, flabbergasted. 
"And you just believed him!?"

I put my hands through my hair.
"I... he was... persuasive. I thought it was a joke at first but we got here and it smelled really bad and I heard sounds that I can't explain." I said, feeling my position grow weaker. 

"It smelled, and you heard things,  and that was enough to go along with kidnapping!? Ever think maybe he's using speakers and a remote?"

"When you say it like that it sounds stupid but C'mon!"

"If you're not with him,  you need to get me out of here. Now." She ordered.

I hesitated, looked at her, and considered the possibility that I was a huge dumbass for going along with everything like I did.

"We have to call the police." She said in a low voice. 
It was the ah-ha moment for me, I reached in my pocket and pulled my cellphone out, I unlocked it and handed it to her then grabbed her other wrist and started un-tying the rope.

"What are you doing!?" Demanded a voice from behind.
She shrieked and I spun around.

The priest stood facing us, wide eyed and angry.
"Get away from the Demon! It's trying to trick you! It's a liar! She's a liar!"

"She isn't a Demon, she's wearing a cross, she read from the bible. Would a demon do that? No!" I said, quickly trying to convince this man that he was wrong.

"This demon isn't like anything we've ever seen. It doesn't weaken around faith, it grows stronger! It is deceiving you Father Gale you must see this!?"

"I'm calling the police, I should have done that right away. They can sort it out." I said, thankfully I could hear Michelle talking to the emergency call operator, I couldn't hear her words but she was talking quickly then she dropped the phone and I could only guess was working on her binds.

"No no no! I can't let her leave!" The priest said urgently, sincerely. 
Then he revealed the knife in his hand, a knife soaked in blood.

I took a minor step back, as anyone would, and felt Michelle tugging at her ropes and squirming, seemingly unaware of the new threat.
"Why do you have that?" I asked, trying to buy us some time, distract him before he could murder her... or us?

"I had to! I had to stop them from releasing her! Nobody can see the truth but me, nobody can see that she IS possessed, all you had to do was perform the exorcism. That's all I needed you for! But you didn't believe me, like they didn't believe me!"
He pointed with the knife as he talked, first aiming it at me, then to her, then to the pews behind him. 

Finally for the first time, I looked back into the nave. 

The pews were full of people, some in regular clothes,  some well dressed, some were even priests but none moved, none spoke, because each of them were propped up side by side in a silent mass of corpses. 
The priest and his knife had been busy.

I froze in fear and panic, the gasp beside me told me that Michelle had finally freed herself and was also seeing the congregation of death.
"Oh my God." She whispered.

Father Donovan took a large step forward and raised his knife 
"How dare you!" He shouted as he pulled back, like a cobra readying it's strike.

I felt Michelle grab my arm, I felt my heart pound, I felt...oddly calm. That death was coming so certainly. The knife would enter my chest most likely and I'd either die immediately or bleed out. Maybe Michelle would get away, maybe he'd catch her. Honestly it wouldn't matter to me either way, I'd be dead.

The church doors burst open, the three of us snapped our heads toward the sound.

"FREEZE!" a policeman shouted.

"He's got a knife!" Cried out Michelle immediately. 

Her voice must have reminded Donovan of what he intended to do, he lunged.

The shots rang out. Two shots so quickly it almost sounded like one pop.

But I heard the shattering of stone as the first bullet penetrated the crucifix on the wall past the murderous priest. Then I heard simultaneously the ripping of flesh, breaking of bones, and the harsh gush of air leaving his body as the second round pierced through his chest.

He spun and fell. I sucked in air and fell back against the stone table Michelle had been wrongfully tied to for who knows how long.

"Are you two alright?" The officer asked quickly. 

"Yes! Yes!" I said quickly.

"We are now" Michelle said, she sat down on the table and sighed relief. "Heres your phone back."

I took it and let myself laugh.

Within minutes we were led outside and sat down in different ambulances, I felt someone put a small blanket over me and looked over to see Michelle holding hers tightly while talking to an officer, no doubt sharing her experience. 

"So you're a priest here?" Someone asked, I looked ahead of me, to the cop that would be getting my ridiculous story.

"No,  I'm not really a priest... it's complicated." I told him. 

"It must be, I've never seen anything like that... the two of you are lucky you're not sitting in those pews too." He said, his face revealing that he could barely comprehend what he had seen inside. 

"Did he kill all of them?" I asked, already knowing the answer.

"Can't say for sure yet, but it looks that way." The officer said solemnly.

"He thought she was a Demon." I told him, rolling my eyes a little as I said it. 

"Well she saved you both with that phone call, she was smart enough to give us the address first and tell us about the priests weapon, sounds more like an angel to me."

I huffed a laugh, thinking yeah maybe she was an angel for getting the right information out quickly. 

"Wait, she knew the address?" I asked, interrupting my own thoughts. 

"Yeah, gave us the address and your names, said the priest had a knife and had killed already."

I thought about this, and replayed what happened in my mind.
She had said before that she didn't know where she was... I never did tell her my name, and the priest hadn't shown the knife until after Michelle had dropped the phone. 

So how could she have known all of this to tell them so quickly?

I looked over to her ambulance and saw that she wasn't in it. Concerned, I stood up and walked toward the emergency vehicle. The officer that had been talking to her stepped out of the back and started looking around. He had apparently lost her too.

I wanted to ask him about her, then I heard an officer calling for me to step aside which I did.

Paramedics were pushing another cart, with Father Donovan strapped down.
He cried out for them to stop, I turned and faced him. 

"Wait! Wait please! She IS possessed! But it's not a demon... it's him! That's why nothing we did worked, he's an angel too, he was always an angel!" He said quickly, "you must tell someone! Anyone!"

It took me a minute to understand and even then I refused to believe it. It wasn't until they explained to me later than none of the bodies had been cut...
They never found the priests knife, which he claims he never had at all.

They didn't find any sort of remote or anything on Father Donovan and nothing in that church had been set up to play the audio  I had heard in there.

I still lay awake remembering everything I can about what happened in that church and to this day there's so much I can't explain. I only know that Michelle is gone, and she was never a demon.

The devil was always an Angel.
