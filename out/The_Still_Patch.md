Elias’s backyard had this crabapple tree that was basically useless. It flowered like mad every spring, bright pink, but never actually produced any decent apples. By late summer, its leaves were already dying off, making a mess on the lawn he rarely bothered with. It was back there, near the dodgy brick wall that shed mortar like dandruff, by the alley, that he found the weird spot.

It wasn't like in the movies, no swirling colours or anything. It was just… still. A patch of air, about the size of a small suitcase standing on its end, where nothing moved. You could see dust floating around everywhere else, but it just stopped dead when it reached the edge of this spot. He saw a fly buzz right up to it and then just veer off like it hit a window, but there was nothing there. Sounds seemed quieter if you were listening *through* it, too – the traffic noise, birds, everything got muffled.

He found it when he dropped a screw trying to fix a fence panel. He crouched down and looked right at it. It didn't hum or glow or feel hot or cold. It was just… missing. Like someone had cut a chunk right out of the air. He poked at it. His finger met something weird – not solid, but like pushing into really thick jelly, only dry. He pulled his hand back fast.

‘‘What the hell?’’

He watched it for a few days. He threw little stones at it; they'd hit the edge and just drop. He tried shining a torch into it, but the light just stopped, didn't bounce off or go through. It just soaked everything up: light, sound, movement. A completely dead zone in the middle of everything else.

One evening, the sun was going down, making everything look orange, and he thought he saw something *in* the patch. Not creatures or another place. It looked more like when you stir up mud in water, that sort of cloudy swirl. Shapes, pale like dust, moved really slowly inside. Sometimes they'd almost look like things he vaguely remembered – the shape of a handle from an old mug, the outline of a bird, a flash of light like off his grandad's glasses. Just faint hints. Leftover images.

It didn't feel dangerous at first, just really strange. He got the feeling whatever was in there belonged there, like the noise the fridge makes or the house creaking. Normal background stuff you don't notice.

He reached out again, pushing his fingers against that weird edge. He kept them there this time, trying to just feel it. That’s when the weirdest thing happened, and it wasn’t about the patch, it was about him.

He suddenly remembered being a little kid, hiding behind this same tree, upset because he’d lost a toy car. He could almost feel the rough bark – like old, dry leather – against his cheek and see the exact green colour of the car. As soon as the memory hit him, a little flicker of that same green colour swirled in the dusty stuff in the patch, then vanished.

He tried again. A tight feeling, like he’d swallowed ice, started low in his gut. He thought about a row he’d had with his sister, the nasty things they’d said. A sharp, broken-looking shape flashed inside the patch, lingering a bit longer this time. He thought about this tune he kept trying to remember but couldn't quite get. A sort of wavy, silvery pattern appeared, and it seemed to pulse faintly, drawing his eye.

He realised it wasn't just a window. It was feeding.

‘‘Feeding’’.

The shapes weren't just echoes; they were the *remains* of thoughts, feelings, moments that had happened there, being slowly broken down, digested by the stillness. And now, it had noticed him.

He pulled his hand back, but the feeling didn't stop. It was like a faint static cling, not on his skin, but *on his thoughts*. He tried thinking about what he'd have for dinner, but the image flickered, replaced for a second by the dusty swirl inside the patch. He tried remembering his mum's face, and for a terrifying moment, the memory felt thin, distant, like it was being pulled away from him towards the stillness behind the crabapple tree.

The patch wasn't just a thin spot where you could see the past getting processed. It was the processor itself. And it was hungry. It had tasted his memories, his emotions. He looked at it again, and the dusty shapes inside seemed clearer now, sharper. He could almost make out the green toy car, the jagged edges of the argument, the silver curve of the melody. They weren't just echoes anymore. They were *his* echoes, added to the collection.

He backed away slowly, his breath catching in his throat. It wasn't a portal *to* somewhere else. It was an endpoint. A place where things ended up, stripped down to faint whispers and then… nothing. And it knew him now. He could feel it, a persistent tugging at the edges of his mind, like trying to remember something you know you've forgotten. He had a horrible feeling that sooner or later, it wouldn't just be his memories it was pulling on. The stillness wasn't empty.

It was waiting…
