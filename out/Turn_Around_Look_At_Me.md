You know, at some point you’ve heard enough creepy stories about something or someplace that you just kind of need to ignore them, or so I thought. As many of you know, the Appalachian mountains are bountiful with lore of the things that roam there. There’s even rules (most of them unexplained) about what you should and shouldn’t do were you to find yourself there: if you hear your name, don’t listen; if you saw something, *no you didn’t.* 



On the other hand, it’s a beautiful place of perennial wilderness–a postcard view made real for those who tread on the lighter side of life. Unfortunately, and much to my own fault, I’ve never been one of those people, but as I’ve been approaching my 40s, it has become quite tiring to constantly be so goddamn uptight and, well… sad. This is to say that I’ve been wanting to get more out of life, and to do things that I normally wouldn’t, so I decided to go camping in those mountains. Because I’d always wanted to. Because at some point you need to not let that nagging fear get you down no longer. Because at some point you need to see the brighter side of life. 



And I did see *something*.



The first couple days went fine. I drove around, taking what road I felt taking and finding a new camping spot each night. On the third day I got a late start, and as dusk began to settle I still hadn’t found a good camping spot. Not wanting to sleep in my car on the side of the road, I decided to keep going, letting the radio keep me company–and to drown out the voices in my head telling me that it wasn’t a good idea to be driving at night. Nothing like some oldies to keep away the thought of running into a deer in the pitch black. 



Soon enough, it really was *pitch black*, making me question my capabilities as a driver. Before this trip, never before had I really experienced that kind of pure darkness, the only light coming from the sliver of a moon in the sky and the faint clouds of the milky way’s billions of stars. 



I should’ve just stopped somewhere. Slept in my car. Waited for the morning light. 



But I kept going. Maybe because the drive had taken on a dreamlike quality, like the feeling of falling asleep. Just the drone of the road beneath the wheels and the unconscious movements of the wheel to keep me on it. The only things that existed in the world were inside the headlights of the car. 



Something happened with the radio. The channel grew faint, buzzing and crackling as the sound of a bluegrass band I didn’t recognize faded slowly into a garbled mess. I tried changing the channel, but none were working any better. I guessed that could sometimes happen when you’re way out in the country. Turning it off for a moment, I contemplated the silence, and decided that I would rather just listen to the electric drone of a dying connection. The silence felt wrong, giving time an infinite quality when it had no measure, no sound to relate to. It was boring, but I’d take boring any day over eerie. 



The radio suddenly cranked up, and it began to scour the channels by its own accord. A cacophony of crackles and buzzing filled the air. I pressed the off-button but it did nothing, and neither did any of the others. I contemplated pulling over to try and figure it out, but the thought of getting out of the car and into the darkness felt impossible, like it would turn liquid and swallow me whole, never escaping it to see the morning’s light of another day.



As the radio made its rounds, some signals started coming through. Faint snippets, unrecognizable. Parts of songs, a radio host’s gravelly voice. *Maybe if it was getting a connection again, the glitch would sort itself out,* I thought. Slowly the voices became clearer, and a familiarity wedged somewhere between the words felt warm and vague. Songs sung by men and women a long time ago, cut into bite-sized chunks, producing a weird sort of loop. *A loop*, the thought suddenly came. *It’s looping the same snippets, over and over again.*



The next time I listened to it, I did so actively, putting the pieces together with each new line.



*Oh stevie, don’t you–*



*…get out of this place, if it’s the last thing we ever do…*



*…the mountain falls…*



*Turn back, oh man…*



*Turn around, look at me…*



The familiarity I’d felt grew strong and comforting for a moment, but as the loop continued, it dissolved into something cold that pricked at the back of my neck. You see, my name is Steve. My friends call me Stevie. 



The radio was still unresponsive to any pushes of a button or a hard smack I gave it. It could’ve all been a glitch, a crazy coincidence emboldened by the darkness of the night and the strange stories that I’d heard. Right? *Right?!*



I couldn’t listen to it. I couldn’t just get spooked by some silly fault in the radio. I’d just become one of those people, writing another creepy story with nothing to it. Just a story. It’s just a story.



*Then why wouldn’t the fucking radio turn off?*



Not giving in, I put on my big boy pants and drove on, determined to keep going. The drive had made me a bit tired earlier, but now I was on alert, my veins suckling the first, faint hints of adrenaline. 



The loop slowly began to falter, parts cutting out one by one until just the last one played. 



*Turn around, look at me… Turn around, look at me…*



I can’t say whether I checked the rearview mirror because of the words or simply reflex. At first, nothing seemed amiss. Just the glow of the car lights illuminating the road into a gray-black blur. But off in the distance…



A pair of eyes, glowing like the stars above. I don’t know how I knew they were eyes, and not something else. Maybe the natural space between them. Maybe some evolutionary quirk that made all mammals be able to differentiate between a set of stars, two egg yolks, and a pair of eyes. Maybe just a gut feeling.



What I found peculiar is that I could definitely say that the eyes weren’t human, but something in them also seemed unlike an animal. Perhaps it was the shape, or just the strange feeling their gaze imparted upon me. Looking at them gave me a headache and a nasty shiver, as my mind tried to place them into the taxonomy of humans and animals and all other earthly creatures, failing to do so. 



Although the eyes were floating, whatever body they were connected to simply a part of the dark canvas, *they weren’t still*. Up and down they swayed, moving along the road like a pair of headlights, just outside of the view of the tail lights. *Following me.* 



I was going at least forty miles per hour. Maybe some animal could match that, at least for a while. It was possible. But how long had it been following me for, I couldn’t say.



*Not for much longer, at least,* I thought as I stepped on the gas, ready to leave all this weird shit in the dust. As the engine revved up and the gears turned higher, the snippet kept playing in the background, the volume rising almost over the engine, as if egged on by the speed of the car.



*Turn around, look at me…* 



The headlights didn’t help much at the speed I was going. If something came up in front of me, there was no way I’d have time to swerve. And swerve where? The forest around me was as black as the sky.



The rearview mirror still framed the pair of eyes, their swaying more rapid and violent as they followed. They seemed to become ever so slightly bigger at each glance. *Coming closer.* Fear wrapped its claws around my stomach, pushing a nauseating rock into my gut. 



The road I was on was long and straight, but at some point it would turn or lead into something. The meter showed eighty miles per hour, and I didn’t dare go any faster– it would surely kill me if I hit something or swerved off road, if it couldn’t already. 



*Turn around, look at me…* 



It was catching up fast, so slowing down wasn’t an option. I mean, I guess there could be a logical explanation. Something that when I slowed down and took a look at again, I’d burst out laughing. But when I looked at those eyes–and I really tried to keep my eyes on the road–there was something vile in them. Something unnatural, like I nor anyone else should have ever looked into them. *A warning.* 



The radio started to click, winding the song snippet backwards, then resuming, but with a different starting point, making what used to be the melody that resolved the line now the beginning.



*Look at me, turn around… Look at me, turn around…*



The road had been straight for too long, and a few slight curves had already introduced themselves into the mix. Soon there would be something there, and I’d crash. The eyes were burning at the back of my mind as I refused to look in the rearview mirror.



*Look at me…*



My options had run out. I’d rather take my chances than die from a fucking car accident. Taking my foot slowly off the gas, I gripped the handbrake.



*…turn around…*



As it turned, I closed my eyes and hoped for the best. 



The car swerved violently, the screeching brakes painting the asphalt like giant brushes dripping with hot black ink. Judging by the sounds, I didn’t go off the road at least, so that was good, and as the car came to a stop, I very nearly decided to not open my eyes at all, realizing suddenly that the movements had felt like a near perfect 180 degree turn. *Whatever had been behind me should now be looking straight at me.*



The dread in my gut was almost enough to convince me otherwise, but I was simply too jittery, and too long gone to not see this to the end. 



When I opened my eyes, the road was empty. Adrenaline had taken its full hold, and with my head on a swivel I checked the rearview mirror and all the windows like a lizard trapped in a terrarium. 



Nothing. Just silence, accentuated by the low growl of the car’s standby. 



But that meant that the radio had turned off as well, which didn’t make any sense. The near panic gave way to a seeping calm like victory. Turning the handbrake again, I began to slowly make my way out, returning where I’d come from. Away from the mountains. 



I let my hands relax into the steering wheel, keeping my eyes on the road. I didn’t try the radio again. After a few miles, my body began to relax and my eyes felt sleepy, like I’d just run a marathon and eaten a big meal afterwards. 



Finally, I dared to look into the rearview mirror once again. To cleanse the dirty feeling still clinging to my body. To see that it had all been nothing. Just a story.



Reflected in the darkness were an army of eyes, like a field of flowers. Something rose up my throat, trying its best to not let out a breath. 



As I kicked my foot down on the pedal, I wished deeply for the sun to [rise](https://wintersnoah.wordpress.com).
