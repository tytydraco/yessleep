Let me clear one thing up, I’m a man of reason. I never believed in ghouls, goblins, or ghosts. 

But one night, that changed. I don't know how to deal with this and I hope someone shares my experience. Or rather, visit.

It happened on a day like any other day. I was in the office. I have an upstanding position at an insurance firm. I’m the companys working bee, I love my work. I’m the first one to show up and the last one to leave. Crunching numbers from 07:00 to 15:00. This day was busy and I left a bit later than usual.

It had been a long day and I was mentally exhausted. I decided to walk home to make up for the time sitting on my ass all day. The walk home takes about 35 minutes. Nothing too strange happened on the road home, other than seeing the shadow of a tall man with a weird shape walking behind me for a short time. I didn't look back and just made a mental note like ”Huh, strange. Must be wearing a weird hood or something. The shadow looks all wrong and bent.”

At home, I did my standard routine. Make food, watch tv, read, go to the bathroom, and then off to bed. I fell asleep within seconds as I always do, some people would call that a superpower.

I woke up from a loud crash in the dead of the night. The moonlight was at least passing through my window. I lay still and just listen, was it my garbage bin on the driveway that fell? I heard the wind howling after all. The house makes cracking noises but it's not out of the ordinary, it's an old house after all. But then I heard something that made me worried, a creak in the hallway. You know, the way old wooden boards sound when someone walks on them. I thought to myself that if someone is breaking in, I will freely give them whatever they want. I hear another creak, closer to my bedroom. 

The door slowly opened less than halfway and I see someone in the opening, standing there, watching me. Completely still. I froze in place and just hoped he would leave. And he did. The shape of the man disappeared from the half-opened door and I heard careful creaks going towards the hallway again.

Then the creaking turned to fast and heavy thuds, someone running to my bedroom. My door slams open and an extremely tall man just stands there, just inside the bedroom. In pure shock at the situation I just lay there, silent. Watching. He doesn't look at me, just stands there with heavy breaths. I start to recognize him, well not entirely but his shape in the dark feels familiar. It's the ”hooded” man from earlier I realized. 

I let out a meager ” What do you want?” And the man starts to pace violently around my bed without saying a word. Back and forth. Then I see it, he isn't wearing a hood or a mask. A wide and abnormally large nose, crooked and bent. It covers most of his face. 

He notices that I notice and I accidentally look at him straight in his eyes, they are completely black, but not in color, the way someone with pure hate would look at you. The way someone with evil intent would look at you. 

His pacing becomes faster and his feet crash on the floor as if it's gonna break. Then he just abruptly stops, which somehow made me even more afraid.

He tilts his head slightly up and starts to sniff in the air, and in doing so, widening his nostrils even more. And I saw right into them, right into his brain. There was no skin in-between. And it twitched every time he inhaled, smelling me.

He started to sniff more violently and moved closer to me. He stopped right beside my bed, beside me. Towering over me. I’m sweating like never before and it feels like my heart is gonna explode and pop out of my chest, from sheer terror. He sniffs louder than looks down at me and smiles. A smile was so terrible it will be forever imprinted in my mind.

And then in a blink of an eye, he is gone. 

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night. I laid in the exact same position until the sun came up, and only then dared I leave my bedroom. My front door was still locked, my back door, locked. Everything was locked, and nothing was broken. No windows or anything. 

How the f did he, or it, get in? What did it want? And what was he smelling on me? Why did it smile so sinister at me when I was the most afraid I’ve ever been in my life?
