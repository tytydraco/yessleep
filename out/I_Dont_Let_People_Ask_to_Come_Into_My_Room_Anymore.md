My name is Joseph. I’m a 25 year old living in Wisconsin. I am part of a very close-knit friend group composed of about 7 people, my two best friends being Ben and Max. Ben is a lively, dependable guy. Max is a very chill guy. Polite, super empathetic, and a bit anxious at times. Both are super funny.

All three of us play games once a week together whenever we find an evening open. It’s the way we hang out when life gets too busy to see each other in-person. It's sort of a comfort zone for all of us. We’ve been doing things this way for years.

In this friend group, it’s a known rule that you’re not allowed to ask to come into my room. You either barge in or don’t come in at all. We’ve never really shared why, outside of our group. I think I just need to share it somewhere. My friends believe me when I talk about it, which was great at first. After the past three-ish years, though, I’ve started to doubt myself and feel awkward keeping it as a rule. I dunno, maybe that’s an excuse. Maybe I just want it out there.

Around three years ago, when I was about to turn 22, I had a free evening after work and texted the group chat to see if Max and Ben were free. At the time I lived in a suburban duplex apartment. I got normal responses from both of them. We have a unique flavor of stupidity that we throw around when talking. It felt pretty standard at the time when they responded.

We started pretty late, around 12:00 AM. Our game sessions usually lasted a few hours, and seeing as I had been getting up at 6:00 AM every morning I was pretty tired and a bit loopy already. We hopped on a game we’d played together probably hundreds of times. The game itself doesn’t matter much, just a standard voice chat game you could run around and screw with each other in.

Everything for the first couple of hours was very normal. Playing on random maps, messing around, moving onto the next one. It was fun as usual. The first instance of something feeling off came when Max and I were separated from Ben and crossing a concrete bridge together. We’d been over this bridge back and forth many times while playing this game in the past. Midway through walking over it, I heard Max’s voice behind me in-game.

“Charlie, come over here! Look at this,”

Seeing as my name is not Charlie I turned to him and tried to respond comically in my best impression of a Boston accent. 

“Who be Charlie?”

It didn’t bother me or anything to be called the wrong name. Not the first time. I just couldn’t think of anyone we knew named Charlie. 

He was looking out over the left side of the bridge. On the right side of this bridge was a giant concrete wall that went up higher than you can realistically climb above. On the left side was a huge, deep cavern with a thick dark fog in it that made it look infinite. He was staring into it.

“Oh, whoops. Yeah, sorry man. But do you see that?”

I ran up and turned my character to look into the fog with him. I couldn’t really see anything.

“Not really. What are you looking at?”

“There’s a little outline of a person down there. It’s really dark, but it’s closer to the base of the bridge than you’d think with the fog.”

I looked down a bit, but searching around I couldn’t see anything. We’d played this map tons of times and already knew most of the odd secrets to find. So, I started to wonder if he was messing around.

“Can you send me a screenshot?”

But there was no response. I waited a few moments, but his character was just sitting there, suddenly dead quiet. It seemed like he’d actually taken his hands off the keyboard and mouse.

“Hellooo?”

My first thought was that his internet was struggling. I sat there waiting to see if he needed to be invited back in. After about 3 minutes, though, I realized it wasn’t his internet. I was about to call him on the phone when his character moved again and turned towards me.

“Alright, good to go?” He said.

I was really confused now. 

“Weren’t you trying to show me something? Could you send me a screenshot of it?” I asked him.

“Sure I’ll snip it later but for now let’s go meet up with Ben.”

At this point I knew he was trying to mess with me. I just ignored it and we ran to Ben.

Ben was already inside of one of the buildings nearby messing with makeshift cars he’d put together from random parts scattered around the map. 

“My engineering degree, finally coming into play,” he said, putting explosives on the front of the car.

We drove around in his vehicle for a while and blew up whatever we found lying around. It was a lot of fun. No different than any other night we’d been playing together. One thing that was abnormal, however, was that Max kept going silent and unmoving for a few minutes at a time and didn’t say anything. That was not really like him at all. He was anxious about inconveniencing people, so he was pretty clear about when he went AFK, usually.

“What do you keep getting up to do, Max?” I asked

“Yeah I was wondering the same” Ben chimed.

Max’s character was running around picking up items.

“Helping my family out with stuff off and on. Why?”

This was a pretty reasonable explanation. His family all lived really close by, so it was normal that he would get up and help them. Weird that they needed it at 2:00 in the morning, though.

So we moved on. It was still unusual for him to do it without warning, but I wasn’t gonna bug him without a real reason.

After another bit of messing around, Max started to get a little quieter. He was still playing, but he didn’t really say much. He also seemed like he was distracted by something. His character would stop moving occasionally, even if he was still talking on mic, like he was looking away from his monitor. I wasn’t the only one to notice, because Ben walked up to him in-game.

“Everything alright, dude? You’ve been really distracted today.”

“Yeah, if you need to go help your family we can finish up playing for tonight.”

He didn’t say anything for a few moments.

“There’s a guy outside on the street that’s walked by the street lamp in front of my house like five times back and forth”

I could hear a bit of anxiety in his voice.

“That’s weird. One of the neighbors?” Ben asked.

“I can’t tell. He’s moving pretty quickly when he does it.” Max responded. I could tell he was watching out his window.

“I don’t… What the hell? That’s scary. The guy’s just standing under it now.” 

“What does he look like?” Ben asked. He sounded as nervous as I was.

“Not sure. Early 30s, maybe? He’s not one of the neighbors.”

“Be careful, man,” I said. 

It was really unusual for Max to be this scared of something. He is an anxious guy with social situations but he’s pretty strong willed when it comes to actual danger.

“I’ll be right back.”

I could hear Max get up away from his computer. Ben and I looked at each other’s characters. After a bit of tense silence, Max finally spoke again.

“He walked away… that was freaky. Glad my window is pretty well covered by the bushes out front.”

“Yeah that’s pretty weird. Might just be an oddball taking a night walk.”

Ben was trying to be reassuring with this, but we were all a bit anxious. It might have been a bit dramatic to be worried about a random person standing under a street lamp, but it was more about how nervous Max seemed. It was really unusual for him. Not to mention how late it was.

We played on for a while. We joked around and started to drift back into laughter. This is where things started to freak me out a bit. I got a call from Max on the phone.

”Hey can you hear me, Joseph?”

“Yeah, why?”

But then I realized something. I could hear Max speaking in voice chat. He was running around and talking loudly with Ben. I could hear it clearly. But what he was saying in-game was not what I heard over the phone.

”Really? I haven’t been able to hear either of you for the past 10 minutes. I didn’t realize it at first until I hadn’t heard either of you speak in a while.”

My brain sort of froze hearing this. I could actively hear Max talking not 10 feet away from my character. 

“Are you talking in-game right now?”

“No, why? Did you do something to try and fix it? I can’t hear you guys at all.”

I didn’t really know what to do here. My heart was speeding up a bit listening to this happen. I muted on my phone and started to talk over voice chat.

”Hey, Max. Can you hear me right now?”

Max’s character turned to me.

”Yeah, loud and clear, boss.”

This is exactly the response I’d expect from Max to a question like this. He had to be messing with me. I unmuted on the phone.

”Are you messing with me, man? I am seriously confused right now. I can hear you talking in-game. You even responded to me.”

”…what? Are you guys trying to mess with me again?”

I could hear that this was genuine confusion. I unmuted in voice chat, and stayed unmuted on the phone.

”So, you can hear me right now?”

Both the Max on the phone and the Max in game gave different responses at the same time. This didn’t feel like something Max could have pulled off for a random joke. It was very convincing. I muted in-game again. 

This started to freak me out. I couldn’t logically figure out what could be going on and it was making me uncomfortable. I kept thinking back to the weird stuff Max was doing while playing. Something about it was bothering me. The Max over the phone was the least likely to be some sort of a hacker, so I decided to talk to him.

”I can hear you talking, in-game. You’re talking right now and messing around with Ben.”

I figured I should just clearly explain to him what’s going on.

”You two need to stop doing stuff like this. It always freaks me out.”

There was a twinge of laughter in his voice. I could tell he didn’t believe me. I’ll admit, Ben and I had messed with him a few times, but nothing to this extent. I guess from his perspective, he just had my word to go off of for what was happening.

”I’m dead serious, Max. I’m not joking.”

By the sound he made, I sensed he could tell I wasn’t screwing with him.

Unfortunately, from here on things got more than uncomfortable. I texted Ben to try and let him know what was going on, but didn’t get a response. I muted my phone and walked up to him in-game.

”Hey, Ben?”

His character wasn’t moving.

”I think he got up to do something real quick.” I heard Max’s character say. I didn’t like that I couldn’t tell if it was really him or not. Both the Max on the phone and the Max over voice chat sounded exactly like him.

I sat there and waited for a while to see if Ben would come back. Then, I heard Max’s character speak again.

“O-Oh holy shit” he said. This sounded like he was genuinely startled. It made my heart sink a bit.

“What?”

“I can’t see it clearly on the street, but I think someone’s being attacked. I see something in the road… and a girl is screaming.”

I heard a loud noise that sounded like him getting up from his chair and ripping off his headphones.

“What the fuck is that.”

“What? What??”

I heard a sudden movement that sounded like he slammed his hands against the desk. His breathing became really loud. He was right next to his mic. It sounded like he was trembling.

“I think- that saw me. It saw me. It looked right at me. Joseph, Ben, someone needs to call the police, my phone isn’t in here. It’s in the other room.”

I was just stuttering, trying to think of a response. At this point I didn’t know what to do, because I was on the phone with who I thought was Max already. Ben was still silent.

“Joseph, please, I don’t know if it saw me and what I just saw… that girl— Joseph I think it’s going to kill me. I have to hide. Tell the police I’m hiding in the-“

I jumped when I heard a loud crash like a window shattering followed by the most horrific scream I have ever heard in my life. Max was screaming for help. This was real. There’s a difference between a fake scream and someone pleading for their life, and this was real. It made me feel queasy.

“Max– Max are you okay?” I screamed through my phone.

“Yeah, I’m fine. Why? What’s going on?”

“Max, you were screaming… It’s coming from your character. You’re being attacked or something. It sounds so real. Please tell me this is a joke. This is too far for me.”

“I would not do that, dude. I’m serious. This is scaring me. Are you both joking with me?”

“I keep telling you, no. Not at all. This is too far.”

I was trembling and didn’t know what to do. I held the phone away from my face, turned to my microphone and asked “Max, what happened?”

There was silence for about 30 seconds. My whole body tensed when, very loudly and clearly, I heard what sounded like someone grabbing the headset and putting it on. I stayed quiet. Someone was breathing very quietly on the other side, and Max’s character began to move again.

Over the phone I asked Max whether he was moving or not.

“No, I’m on the phone across the room from my PC.”

Something about the air of the situation had changed. I didn’t know if I should move my mouse or speak. What was moving the character? Who was I on the phone with? It sounded like Max. Was it?

Out of nowhere Max’s character turned and froze, staring straight at my character. After a moment, it ran up to mine and Max started speaking in-game.

“Can I come in, Joseph? Can I come in, Joseph? Can I come in, Joseph?”

It repeated this over and over. It didn’t take a breath. The sound was almost like a recording. Then, I realized something. 

I tore off my headphones. I remember feeling every hair stand up across my body. The character was repeating the phrase— I could hear it in my headphones. But, removing them, I could still hear it. It wasn’t just coming from my headphones. It was muffled, coming from my closet just a few feet behind me.

I was unable to speak or move. Something about the noise I made caused Max to sound panicked.

”Dude, what’s wrong? Are you crying?”

“Something is in my room.”

I could barely get the words out.

Max said he was going to call the police, which made me panic even more. I would be alone with this thing while he was off the phone.

“No, Max, please stay on the phone. It’s here. It’s in my closet. I’m terrified.”

“What do you mean, ‘it’? Wait, no, just stay quiet. I’ll stay, don’t worry man. I’m here. I’ll message the group chat and tell someone to call the police to your house.”

I sat there silently for far too long, shaking. I could still hear the muffled words coming from my closet. Not once did it pause or slow down. It sounded like Max, but I knew it wasn’t. I couldn’t tell if it sounded excited or distressed. Its voice was getting shakier with each passing repeat. My heart was going so fast I thought I was starting to have a heart attack.

I wasn’t even trying to figure out what this was, anymore. I wanted out of there, but the door out of my room was on the other side of the closet.

“Okay, Joseph. Mary is calling the police. Just stay put and quiet. I’m also getting in my car to drive over there to you. I’ll tell the others to meet me there, too.” I tapped my phone in an attempt to acknowledge him. 

Suddenly, the repeating voice stopped. I was petrified to think it may have heard me. The tap was so quiet, I don’t know how anyone would be able to hear it, especially from the other side of a closed closet door. I’d also spoken a moment ago. Why did it react this time? Then, it started up again, repeating. Whatever it was, it was listening for movement.

Despite this, I decided I’d try to get past the door. The window behind me would be loud, so it wasn’t an option. I took very slow steps, trying my best not to creak the wooden floor boards beneath the carpet.

I got to right before the closed closet door. I could hear it clearly, deep in the lower part of the closet. It wasn’t whispering. And now that I was closer to it I could hear something else. Very quietly and softly, in between repeats, I could hear what sounded like tapping on the door. It was almost as if it was trying to knock. I did not want to step in front of that door. Every part of me was resisting.

The moment I put my foot in front of the closet door, the voice stopped. I have never experienced heightened senses like I did at that moment. The silence felt so loud it hurt. My skin felt like it was burning horribly on the side closest to the closet, in what I assume was bated anticipation of something opening the door.

I had to stop myself from screaming when the door shook violently with three consecutive hits. It was knocking again, but much more forcefully now. This time it was directly next to my head on the other side of the closet door. The knocking was followed by the repeating phrase starting back up again. It sounded faster— more frantic. It almost sounded like it was on the verge of screaming. It was very clearly as close to the door as possible. I wanted to run so badly.

With every step forward, the voice followed me, inches away from my ear on the other side. It obviously knew I was there, so I just gave into my fear and sprinted. I got to my bedroom door and started to open it. My skin felt like it was still on fire from the fear. I heard something violently turn my closet doorknob behind me and push it open with immense force.

I did not wait or look, I ripped open my door and flung myself through, slamming it behind me, and sprinted into the living room. I don’t remember what I said to Max at that point over my phone. Apparently he could hear over the phone what I’d been hearing once I’d gotten close enough to the closet. I could tell he was rushing to get into his car.

Watching, nothing came out of my room. Nothing even touched the door. It was just pure silence. I kept listening, but nothing made a sound. Waiting there in silence was horrible. I began wondering if it entered some other part of the house. But for some reason I had a strong feeling in the pit of my stomach. If I took my eyes away from the door, that thing would know. I could feel it. It was still waiting, watching me for the moment I stopped looking. I don’t even know if I blinked.

After an eternity I could hear the police sirens. They arrived and found me trembling in the corner of my living room. I don’t remember much during this – at least accurately – but I know they searched the home and the room thoroughly. Max and the others arrived one by one not too shortly after. I had no proof of what was going on, but the police believed something had happened because of how horrified I was. 

Unfortunately, they suspected it was a bad drug trip of some kind. Granted, that is not only the more reasonable explanation, but is also not uncommon here. My friends and parents testified that I was not a user of drugs of any kind, so I didn’t have to get a drug test, but I get the feeling the officers used that as their explanation.

My friends and I did our own search of the house, after the fact. My friends are over-protective of each other, so it was hard to convince them not to. We ended up finding a few things. We also found that a number of the clothes I had in the closet were covered in what looked like wet ash— specifically the bottom of my hanging shirts and jackets. It was like whatever was crouched under them was covered in it. The same substance was scraped across the door from where it had followed me. It smelled horrible. I don’t even know what I’d compare it to. It just smelled rotten, like death. Then, what made us leave immediately after was the fact that my closet door was still open, but my window was closed.

That thing never left my room. I don’t know how long it was waiting in my closet, but I didn’t want to assume it could just phase through walls. I’d been in my room all day. I didn’t feel comfortable assuming the thing had just vanished off somewhere. Instead, we left immediately, and I stayed with Max for a month while I moved apartments. I feel terrible about this, but I hired movers to transport everything. I didn’t want to go back there. I also warned the owner of what had happened, and, as I expected, they didn’t really seem to believe me.

I don’t blame them. It’s honestly difficult for me to figure out what really happened in that situation. There’s a few more things. These two bothered me more than all the others. Firstly, Ben hadn’t played with us at all that night. He showed us, and he hadn’t even received the text I sent, nor Max’s response. Max and I both showed him that he’d responded to the group chat. He assured us he never even knew we were playing that night. So, even beyond whatever it was imitating Max, it also imitated Ben from the start.

Finally, something far worse came up in the next few days. This is what assured me beyond anything else this was not a hallucination. In Max’s neighborhood, a woman was found mutilated in a field that lined the street in front of Max’s house a few days after all of this happened. No information was put forward to the public other than her name. It was one of Max’s neighbors. One he’d never spoken to, but a woman he’d seen many times. She was dead. Whatever was speaking to me as Max wasn’t just making things up. It had killed that woman and told it to me as if Max was watching it happen. I’ve wondered many times if it was really happening in front of Max’s house while I was on the phone with him.

I burned the clothes that had the ash on them out in a field as soon as I got them from the movers. I didn’t want anything to sit, remaining from this. Ever since that night we’ve depended more heavily on in-person hangouts. The anxiety has dissipated, as nothing’s happened since then. It almost feels like a dream. If it weren’t for Max and the experience with Ben, I’d have probably been able to say it was a bad nightmare or something. I don’t know if that would be better or worse.

I’m not looking for anyone to believe me. I suppose I wanted closure of some kind. If something like that is out there, it makes me wonder what else we don’t know about in our daily lives. It scares me.

How often do we interact with people we consider friends and family without realizing they’re a cheap imitation? That thought runs across my mind every time I have a sentimental conversation with a friend over the phone, or think of a good memory with a person I love where we weren’t face to face. Someone getting my name wrong sends so much anxiety through me. If I couldn’t see them in these memories, was it them? Were they really there? For my own sanity, I have chosen to try and believe they were. However, I have a feeling I will never have a way of really convincing myself it’s true.
