**Full story** [**here**](https://youtu.be/hV2TBFe2ODI)  
On December 31st, 2022, three policemen were dispatched to a house after receiving a call from a neighbor who reported hearing loud, strange noises coming from inside. The neighbor claimed to have heard deep guttural noises and piercing screeches that were unlike anything they'd ever heard before. When the police arrived on the scene, they were deeply disturbed by what they found.

The video of the incident was taken by a paramedic who was immediately called to the scene. As it turned out, the police had requested immediate medical care as they were unprepared to deal with the situation at hand. They had no idea that the house they were in had once belonged to a family of cannibals who enjoyed butchering human flesh and making exotic dishes that consisted of human remains. This cannibalistic family has since passed away, but their house still remains in its shabby condition in a small town located in Greater Poland.

On the night of New Year's Eve in 2022, a 20-year-old woman named Kamilka had been inside the house with a couple of friends. They were all playing with a Ouija board with the intent of conjuring the spirits of the cannibalistic family and the victims they consumed. This was a bad idea, as all of a sudden, Kamilka began acting erratically and extremely feral before barricading herself inside a room. According to her friends, Kamilka had seemingly become possessed.

When the police arrived, they were highly unnerved by what they saw. Kamilka's terrifying behavior prevented the police from entering the room to save her. As a final attempt to get her out, they placed a ladder against the side of the room where she was hiding. However, this plan did not go as expected.

The police told Kamilka that her daughter was with them in an attempt to lure her out of the room, but this didn't seem to work, as she remained inside. Unfortunately, not much else was caught on camera as the video ends abruptly. But according to the paramedic who shot the video, Kamilka was eventually taken to the hospital. Strangely enough, it was upon arriving at the hospital that she started acting normal again.

After being thoroughly examined by a psychiatrist, Kamilka showed no signs of any psychiatric disorders, which added to the mystery of the incident. Her blood was also tested for any intoxicating substances that could potentially explain her strange behavior. However, the tests came back negative, as no traces of drugs or any other substances were found in her system. The absence of any clear explanations left everyone involved feeling bewildered and unsettled.

To this day, Kamilka's family and friends remain at a loss as to what exactly transpired inside that house on the fateful night. Despite their efforts to understand the events and find an explanation, they have been unable to uncover any solid answers. All that they know for certain is that they never want to witness their beloved daughter and friend in such a horrifying state ever again. The chilling experience has left a lasting impact on Kamilka and her loved ones.

The question of whether Kamilka was genuinely possessed or had experienced a temporary psychosis continues to perplex all those who have heard her story. The lack of concrete evidence and the unexplainable nature of the events have fueled speculation and debate among paranormal enthusiasts and skeptics alike. As time goes on, the haunting of Kamilka remains an enigmatic tale that continues to intrigue and mystify those who hear it, serving as a chilling reminder of the unknown forces that may lurk in the shadows.
