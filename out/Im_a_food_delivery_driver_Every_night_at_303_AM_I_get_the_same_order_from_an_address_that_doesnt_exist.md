You see some weird stuff when you work the graveyard shift.

You can call me Alex. I’ve been doing food delivery in the city for almost two years now. I’ve seen it all... drunks, creeps, girls answering the door in nothing but underwear… nothing surprises me anymore.

Or at least, that’s what I thought... until last month.

Trust me: some orders aren’t meant for people like us.

It was supposed to be my last delivery of the night. The time was 3:03 AM. Then my phone buzzed. Ping. New order.

The tip was almost thirty bucks. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. Thirty dollars for one meal? Hell yeah. But when I opened the details, I froze.

Meal: Premium Sirloin Steak ×1 (Note: Absolutely raw)

Drink: Saltwater ×1 (Note: As much salt as possible)

Who the hell orders raw steak and saltwater at three in the morning? Some kind of joke? Whatever... money’s money. I headed to the high-end steakhouse. The kid at the counter gave me a weird look when he read the ticket.

"Dude… is this even edible?"

"Beats me," I said. "It’s what the customer wants." He shrugged, but I could tell he was uneasy. "I guess someone finally ordered one of the joke menu items."

The address was 123 Blackwood Lane, Apartment 44. The GPS led me down a dead-end street... one flickering streetlight, rusted metal fencing, and a half-finished construction site that looked abandoned for years. The air smelled like rot and damp earth.

The building numbers stopped at sixteen. No Apartment 44.

I tried calling the customer. Static. That old "hssssss..." sound, like a radio stuck between stations.

Support told me to dispose of the food and that I’d still get paid. Fine by me. I stared at that raw steak for a bit, then tossed it into a convenience store trash can.

The next night, 3:03 AM sharp... the same order popped up. Same items, same address, same generous tip.

"Son of a bitch!" I muttered, but I still took it. This time, I just dropped it by the fence, snapped the photo for proof, and left.

And it happened again.

And again.

Every night, 3:03 AM, like clockwork. For two weeks straight. I even gave the guy a nickname: Construction Bro.

Then, last Wednesday, my curiosity got the better of me.

After I dropped off the order, I parked around the corner, killed the engine, and waited. No lights. No sound. Just that flickering streetlamp at the end of the lane. After about five minutes, I saw it.

Something squeezed through a gap in the fence.

It was tall. Thin. Its body looked like a person wrapped in a giant black trash bag. The joints bent in ways that no human body should. It didn’t walk or crawl... it dragged itself across the ground, boneless and silent.

At first I thought, Jesus, it’s some asshole in a costume. Then I noticed the ground under the streetlight. The light hit it... but it had no shadow. The concrete around it was spotless, as if the darkness itself had eaten it clean.

It picked up the bag. I heard this faint, wet hiss... like acid eating through plastic... and then it slid back through the fence and was gone.

I didn’t move for a full minute. My hands were shaking so bad I dropped my keys twice before starting the engine. Then I floored it.

Since that night, I keep seeing it. Sometimes in the reflection of my helmet visor at red lights. Sometimes in the dark corners of apartment hallways when I deliver late. Always tall. Always watching. And always gone when I turn my head.

I haven’t been sleeping much. I think I’m losing it.

It’s 2:55 AM right now. I’ve locked every door. Unplugged the router. Phone on airplane mode. If I’m not online, it can’t find me. Right?

My phone just buzzed.

It shouldn’t have.

New order. The app somehow bypassed airplane mode.

Order Time: 3:03 AM

Meal: Premium Sirloin Steak ×1

Drink: Saltwater ×1

Same order. But the address isn’t the construction site this time.

It’s my address. My building. My apartment number.

And there’s a delivery note. Just one line.

"This time, I’ll come get it."

I hear it now. That wet dragging sound at the end of my hallway. It’s getting closer.

I shoved the bookshelf against the door but...wait...!

Something’s turning the lock. Not forcing it. Just… turning it. I can hear the mechanism groaning, tumblers grinding and falling into place one by one, slow, deliberate...

THUNK.

The door is unlocked. If you’re a driver and you see that order... decline it. Don’t ever...
