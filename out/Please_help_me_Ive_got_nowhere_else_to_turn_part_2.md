I'm freaking out right now and I'm really confused. I don't really understand this subreddit, I've not encountered it before, but it looks like it's for discussing supernatural events, well I don't really know if this counts but I'm at a complete loss. Hang on, I'm rambling a bit, let me explain what's going on, at least as well as I can. I don't really understand it myself. This isn't my account; it's actually my boyfriend Tim's account.

I was a bit concerned about him because I had been texting him last night and hadn't gotten any replies. We've been together for over a year, and this seemed very out of character, so on my way to work this morning, I decided to pop over to his house and see what was going on.

I arrived at his flat pretty early; at a guess, I would say it must have been around 7ish. There was a thick, almost viscous fog near the flat, you could practically bite it. I didn't think much about it at the time but given everything I've found now; it did seem a bit strange. It was a beautifully clear winter day, but about 2 minutes from the flat, I encountered the fog. It was almost like a wall; it came on so suddenly. As I said though, at the time, I assumed it was just a slightly strange meteorological phenomenon.

Once I had got to the building, I entered the code at the main door to get inside the building and then I let myself into his flat with my key. The flat was in a complete state. Everything was a mess, there were strange occult symbols all over the walls, and most importantly, there was no sign of Tim. All I found was this phone that I've never seen before, and it was open on Reddit, signed into this account. Again, this looks like it's a new account, and it's certainly not his normal account.

I couldn't stay at the house for very long as I needed to get to work on time, and Tim lives a fair distance from the office where I work, so I didn't have a lot of time to investigate that throughly, I just grabbed the phone I found and left.

I'm currently on my lunch break and I'm now really confused about what's going on. On my way to work, I tried calling him multiple times on his normal phone (which wasn't at the flat), but his phone just went straight to voicemail. I left another message, telling him that I was worried about him and that I wanted to help him if he needed it. I’ve not had any reply from him though, complete radio silence.

Over my break though, I had a chance to check the phone I found more thoroughly and discovered his previous post (see the link above). I'm at a complete loss. None of this makes any sense. He never mentioned anything about this to me. Also, he said he was going to come and stay with me last night, but he never showed up.

Even more strange, the night before last, when he thought he saw the figure, he wasn't staying in his flat. He was sleeping over at mine. Why would he make that bit up? Also, he mentioned that the building had a supernatural history going back centuries, but the building was only constructed 10 years ago. It's like super modern! Before that, it was just woodland. The whole estate is a new construction. It's like he's talking about a completely different place.

I just don't get it. Why didn't he say anything to me? Also, what was with all the symbols? Clearly, something was going on, or he would still be around. I've got no idea about the occult though. I forgot to get any pictures though. I'll head back after work and try and get some pictures. Maybe that will help to work out what's going on and where Tim has gone.

I'm just so worried about Tim, and I don't know what I can do. I've tried calling his friends and family, but nobody seems to know where he is. I'm afraid he might be in some kind of trouble. I hope he's okay and that he contacts me soon. I miss him and I want to help him if he needs it.

I'm going to call the police and report him missing, but I think you have to wait 48 hours before you can report a person missing. I don't really know why I couldn't just report it now. I don't have a lot of information to give them, and the bits I do have are totally random and make no sense, but something is definitely wrong. People don't just disappear like this.

As I sit here typing this on Tim's phone, I can't help but feel a sense of dread and uncertainty. The strange symbols, the eerie fog, and Tim's sudden disappearance are all adding up to something, but I don't know what. Maybe I’m overreacting, but I just can't shake the feeling that he must be in trouble or that something terrible has happened to him.

Even worse, I think I might be in danger now too, since I visited the house the strange fog hasn't cleared all day, but when I checked the forecast, the news even my friend's social media posts I couldn't find any other mention of the fog. I know I'm not imagining it though as my colleagues have commented about how strange it is. It's almost like the only fog in the city is localised around me. I'm also convinced now that someone has been following me ever since I left Tim's flat. At first it was just a feeling, but as the day has gone on I've caught short glances out the corner of my eye, only briefly and never clearly, just short momenst as they disappear around a corner or behind an obstruction. Each time I caught a glimpses though I saw the same long black coat. After a few I check to see who it was but when I investigated I couldn't find any sign that anyone had been there at all.

If I don't do anything I'm afraid that what ever happened to Tim is going to happen to me, so I think I need a plan. If I can't get help from the police I'm going to need to do something myself. After work I'm going back to the house I'm going to document all of the symbols and I'm going to search throughly for any clues. I'm probably over thinking everything but the fog has freak me out a bit after everythimg Tim was posting so even though I don't really believe in any of this, I'll take some salt and sage just incase. I might see if I can pick up a crucifix on my way over too.

I'm sorry for rambling on and for posting this on his reddit account, but it made sense so that it would make it easier to refer back to his previous post, any if I’m lucky maybe Tim will log in and see this. I've been trying to think of possible explanations for what's going on, but nothing seems to make sense. Tim has never mentioned anything about this Reddit account or the strange post that he made last night, or anything at all even remotely related to this. He's always been very open with me, so it's not like he was keeping secrets, it just doesn’t make any sense. I’m at a complete loss. I’ve got no idea how to process any of this. If anyone has any information or advice, please let me know. Please help me I’m begging, I’m just so worried about him!
