The water enveloped my body again as I felt it rush up against me and splash my face. It reminded me of a bath that had been left too long; an unsettling mix of warm and cool that left the body unsure of what to think. It was too hot to be refreshing and too cold to be soothing.

I thrashed to the surface, huffing and wheezing in surprise. The wild colours and shapes were replaced by a disconcerting darkness as suddenly as my footing had disappeared. I was blinking frantically, trying to figure out where I was. After some time, and as I came to the realisation that I was not in any danger, my panic subsided and my vision adjusted to the world around me.

I was out of the frying pan and into the freezer. After blinding me with light, it had suddenly vanished, and I was plunged into darkness. That was all except for a large source of light above me, suspended in the darkness and casting a dim funnel of light into the large cavern below. It appeared to be oddly circular, in a way that reminded me of the mouth of the cave where I had begun this journey. I let my eyes fall downwards, following the falling pillar of light until it met some resistance – a soft and shimmering ripple on the surface of the water ahead of me. The rest of the cavern was in darkness. Even looking for the edge of the water nearest to me proved to be a challenge.

Although I had lost most of my equipment already, my headlight was still with me. I clicked it on, but no light came out from it. Damning my luck and thinking it to be broken, I took it off to inspect. To my surprise, the face of the torch was indeed lit up, but there was no light coming off it at all. It was as though the air around the torch was swallowing it all. It was now no more than a bright paperweight.

I still felt somewhat in a daze. It was not the oozing drunkenness from before but rather a numb serenity. I suppose I should have been panicking with all that had taken place, but, oddly enough, I found it more comforting than anything else to be off my feet again. My body had felt heavy on the land, with each step sending me further into an exhausted haze. As soon as I started floating, though, it was like the pain and discomfort slipped away. I pushed myself off the wall of the underground lake and started to swim in a kind of mock breaststroke. With no fins to help me, the only thing I could do was take things slow.

I felt a very soft current tug at me, trying in vain to pull me to the right. Although I doubted it could carry me, I was very weak at this point, and so I made a mental note to watch out for any drift. I would have to make a dash back for the edge in that case.

As I made my way towards the light in the centre, I became more fixated on it. The world around mattered less and less as my vision sharpened and narrowed in on my destination. The closer I got, though, the less it seemed like I was moving. As much as I kicked and thrashed in the water, the less I moved. I felt stuck, frozen, yet with an odd sense of calm. This was exactly where I was meant to be. I was on the right track.

Suddenly it was upon me. In not so much as the blink of an eye, the barrier between dark and light was looming directly in front of my face. It gave off a kind of heat that was immediately noticeable. It had a kind of pulling effect – a strange attraction that made me want to bask in this light. Giving in to this strange desire, I pushed forward and into the light.

Immediately my vision changed. I was hit by a steering light, brighter than looking straight into the sun, and snapped my eyes shut. The pain was immediate and intense, even through closed lids. From behind my closed eyes, I could make out too many colours to count, all moving and twisting of their own accord. I pressed my hand over my face to block the light, but it was no use. My hand may as well have been made of glass. The colours continued to dance as they had before.

I didn’t have time to think of what to do next, as I felt an icy grip take my ankle and pull me sharply downwards. In a split second, I was wrapped in a powerful current and was being swept away quickly to one side. A massive force threw me like debris in a tornado. I was caught in an undertow, an underwater current of immense power. As frightened as I was, I couldn’t help but appreciate the true power of this force of nature.

It was difficult to move my muscles, as the power of the current was practically pinning me in place. I tried my hardest to thrash in any direction, reaching out to grab anything to save me. Unexpectedly I managed to grab on to a jutting-out piece of rock. From its feeling and the angle of my own body, I knew it to be the mouth of yet another tunnel. I was being pulled straight into it.

I remember the water rushing furiously into my face, pulling my mouth into a grotesque smile and peeling my eyelids back into my skull. Through the dark waters, all I could make out was the funnel of light, located far away from where I now was, quickly growing larger and larger. It was moving right towards me.

Again I felt the light upon me, and my world shifted before my eyes. Innumerable shapes and colours rushed past me, themselves not immune to the pull of the current. Strangely though, I could make out figures that were more solid and corporeal. Although I could not make out any defining features through the mess of light and colour, they appeared humanoid in shape. They were in front of me, next to me, and all around me. They observed me calmly, not out of hatred but more of an idle curiosity.

Everything was alive. The waters were teeming with activity. It shifted and coiled endlessly. It sparkled with electrical and spiritual essence. I could see the molecules of H₂O; they were as bright as diamonds, conducting energy between themselves. It was alive, all of it. And I was floating in it. It was enlightening and terrifying in unqualifiable measures, both brilliant and dull, malevolent and benevolent.

The source of the light of the funnel pierced through all of this, however, which was more blinding to look into than the sun itself.

“Look,” said a voice, and I listened. I held my gaze despite the onslaught of activity; as I did, I felt my retina begin to sear and wither. I wanted to look away – my eyes screamed at me to do so – but I could not. But as much as I wanted to, something else inside wanted more and more. My vision began to crumble before me, and I came to a stark realisation, the weight of which I still feel to this day – it was looking directly at me.

No sooner had I felt this than a mighty tug pulled me from the ledge like I was a mere child. I went tumbling back into darkness, one that I feared would be permanent.

Nothing could have prepared me for waking up in darkness. For a time I even thought I was in my bed, back at home, warm and tucked away. This was not the case, though.

I was blind; this much I knew. My eyes were husks, dry and burnt. Moving them was agony, so I kept them shut tight – not that having them open would have helped. It seemed like the logical thing to do – not to struggle. Just to accept my new state of being, sightless but not afraid.

I could feel cool ripples of the water brush past my skin. It was no longer a furious torrent. I could move my fingers and toes and could feel it move between them. There was a serenity to it. Something like an evening breeze but many times more soothing.

I came to a slow realisation that my mask was not fixed to my face. I wasn’t able to breathe, and yet it hardly troubled me. I had no need or desire to, in any case. All I wanted was to be cradled forever in the cave’s palm.

I was lying against something soft. It wasn’t the terribly smooth and hard stone that had accompanied me through this journey, but something else entirely. I laid a hand upon it and slowly brushed from side to side. It was soft to the touch but firm as anything. It held me, and I felt a kind of protection that was entirely new. It was there, and it was with me, and, in a strange way, we felt like one and the same.

I cannot say how long I was there. It could have been minutes or hours. It would not have surprised me if I had been there for years and decades, or even longer still. I could have been there since the beginning, since the mountains moved and the earth formed itself around me. It didn’t matter. It was the first time I felt true peace with everything.

Finally, I felt a shift. I got the sense that it was time. Time for what, I did not yet know. But I was not surprised when I felt the same icy grip gently wrap my body and lift me from my resting place. I could feel them around me again, though something had changed about them. There was a purpose to them, and for some reason they wanted me.

They whisked me away, somewhere down beyond. I thought about all the things that had seemed so important while I was coming here: my equipment, the depths I would go and the things I would see. They all seemed so meaningless in that moment. I had been just a fool in the search for greatness.

I could hear them chattering, although it was in a tongue totally alien to me. This language of theirs did not use words or sounds; it was entirely of the mind. And I could hear them but not understand. I was tapped in to some degree, but comprehension was still out of reach. It was frustrating, and all I wanted then and there was to join them; to belong.

It wasn’t long before they stopped, still holding me in place like some kind of injured bird with my head hung limp. I heard something stir. It was distant at first, like a low hum from the centre of the Earth. It quickly grew in volume and intensity until it was shaking my body like a plaything. The others released me as slowly and gently as they had picked me up in the first place. I did not move. The current swam around me, but I stayed in place. The hum was holding me there, locked and poised for whatever was to come next. My head started to rise through no will of my own, and I could feel an imposing presence towering over me.

It was looking down at me, regarding me as the frail thing that I am. This thing – this force – was something immense. It was powerful beyond reason, and I could feel its very essence pouring out in all directions. Even those that had carried me had now left. I was now in communion with what I can describe as nothing less than a god.

Without my sight, my other senses were in high gear, and each of them was overflowing with awareness of the entity. It was in the water coursing around me, in my ears, and down my throat. I could taste it on my tongue – an entrancing mixture that shifted continuously between bitter and sweet. It roared with passive vibrations that sent shivers deep into the dimension around it. It was everywhere. It was everything.

The longer I listened, the less I heard a roar and the more I began to understand its magnificent song. When we did speak, it was, as with the others, the simple sharing of ideas in a language purely of the mind. In truth, the dialogue was entirely one-way; I could only listen. It was short-lived, and much of the true essence of what it said was wasted on myself. The only real things I could glean from it were feelings of both bemusement and amusement.

We stayed there for a time, locked in an otherworldly embrace. I was so afraid. I didn’t know if it would kill me or something worse. The only thing I could do was wait for it to render its judgement on me. It roared once more – my teeth clenched and my bones rattled. The vibrations alone threatened to knock me out.

The chattering of the others picked up. Whereas before they were only the vaguest whisper in my ear, now they were singing in chorus with the great one. The bassy harmony kept growing, and the pitch kept rising. What started out as a deep rumble gradually changed to a piercing wail. Eventually, the pitch went so high that it became inaudible to my inadequate human ears, though I knew the song continued.

I started to lose sense of myself. It started as a feeling of numbness in the tips of my fingers and the ends of my toes. There was no pain, just the oddest sensation of not being there anymore. I instinctively brought my hands together to feel each other. I tried rubbing my now seemingly dead fingers against my palms only to find nothing but stumps. I was flaking away, just as it told me I would. I didn’t understand back then, but now I know. I was going to be nothing soon, and that was best. Serenity; I felt it again.

In that moment, I was certain I was at the end. Whatever was happening to me, I was powerless to resist, and so I just accepted it. To nothing I had come, and to nothingness I was returning. The numbness kept spreading, and before long I could not be certain if any part of me remained. As far as I was aware, I was just a jumble of thoughts existing at the end of time, no body to cry, no mind to think.

They say that, before meeting death, one’s life flashes before their eyes. This was not the case with me, though. Instead of visions of my family, friends, my job and house, or even past lovers, the only thoughts that crossed my mind were of this cave, this being before me, and my complete despair that my eyes could not do me the service of letting me see it for myself.
