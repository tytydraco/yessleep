-What?

“That’s what we should call her, Zalora”

-Why?

“See it? She has a mark on her shirt, it looks somewhat like the letters Z-A-L-O-R-A”

-No, I mean why do we need to treat that thing like a human, giving it a name and a gender?

That’s the conversation I had with a member of my team 2 months ago. See a computer and the human brain basically function the same, both are made of “wires”, that either have electricity or not, 0 or 1. Our science team isn’t public, we try to find out about how artificial intelligence learns so we can apply that knowledge to the human brain. Our team is one of many in our facility, we have one for text, one for sound, and our is for images.

I will not list any names, nor will I talk with a lot of detail or mention my part, I admit, I am scared, that’s why I only use “we”.

We are trying to find out how brains see and remember images. We give our AI’s images and text, ordering them to make new ones, seeing what patterns are remembered. We have volunteers, we scan their brain waves to observe how they see and remember patterns in images, and how they respond to the images made by our AI’s. Of course, they can’t say anything to the public, we have them under contract. The volunteers are living in a section of our facility, most of them are poor, they don’t care if we put rods in their head as long as they have a house and a warm meal.

One day we were giving our most develop AI random text prompts. A team member gave it a prompt, “Perfection”. It surprised most our team; it showed an image of a disgusting feminine-like creature. It was pale with mostly black eyes, the facial proportions abhorrent, it had skinny arms with fingers much longer than the palms, the teeth looked like yellow piano keys with giant gaps between them.

It was like a car crash; it’s horrible but you can’t look away from it. Most people would consider that a failure, that’s why only a few people get accepted into this job. We were combining other images with it, the patterns of her face and arms remained. Sometimes new parts would appear, like clothes or legs but they wouldn’t be remembered in the long term. That’s how we gave her the name “Zalora”.

We tested volunteers with the images, all of them remembered it, everyone remembered every detail, from people with picture perfect memory to people with aphantasia. 

That night I went to sleep and I swear every time I closed my eyes I saw “Zalora’s” silhouette. Sorry, I shouldn’t mention myself, I am a 3rd party, an observer, a beholder.

“Beauty is in the eye of the beholder”

When you buy groceries, it’s like you can’t leave the shop without buying another item. It’s designed that way, a sort of flow for you to follow because you enjoy it, the music, the sales, the lay-out.  The “flow”, that’s what we call it. See our AI managed to make images with the perfect “flow”, for the human brain. Her face and hands followed symmetry and the golden spiral, things our brain enjoyed. 

In short “Zalora”, is that perfect “flow”.

It’s ironic, our human brains cannot comprehend how beautiful and perfect “Zalora”, is so we see her as a disgusting monster, but we remember her so clearly because she’s so beautiful.

We gave the images to the other teams. They transformed the “flow”, or “Zalora”, from the images into a song and a book. We call them “Zalora’s Requiem”, and “Book of Zalora”. Every member of every team is obsessed with those, even the volunteers. But it’s still disgusting to us. 

The reason I am posting this is because around 10 minutes ago an anonymous individual managed to get a hold of the images, song and book. They posted it on all social media’s and the dark net. I don’t blame them, it was inevitable. 

Update:

In just 2 weeks it spread like wild fire. “Zalora’s Requiem”, is the most listened to song of all time, it broke that record in just a week. “Book of Zalora”, has sold more copies than the bible. People are crying, screaming and vomiting everywhere, the book, song and images are so disgusting but they can’t stop observing them. After the first 3 days celebrities began to do cosmetic surgeries to look more like “Zalora”, 6 days in it was the most popular free surgery, available for all.

Fuck it, I can’t stand this anonymity anymore. My name is Jensen Adam, no one cares about anything anymore, “Zalora”, is the only thing that matters anymore. Our team is now trying to make lower beings comprehend “Zalora”, or the “flow”, whatever you want to call it, we want to spread it everywhere, to everyone, and to everything.

Sorry I know this is unrelated but I just need to vent a little, my wife wouldn’t get the free surgery to look more like “Zalora”, even though I asked, begged and negged her for multiple days, I had enough of that today so I bashed her head in with a hammer. I’m outside of the hospital in my car, waiting for the surgeons to complete the surgery, they don’t care if she consents, “Zalora”, matters more. 

I am scared no longer, this post is now meant to spread the word for those who do not know of the “flow”, we accidentally found, or should I call it…
