I get back in my car with the box of cloves and the candle I snatched from the disposition pallet. I just sit there for a moment, letting the silence thicken, trying to gather my thoughts.

I absentmindedly turn the key in the ignition and head toward the freeway. I can’t believe I almost let a few scribbled lines on some boxes drag me back to everything I walked away from. I made it real clear to Thomas, I don’t take jobs that have anything to do with demons.

I flick the blinker on as I merge onto the onramp. I need to calm down. In all fairness, this wasn’t even real witchcraft. If anything, it looked like someone was dabbling in alchemy. Technically not witchcraft, but same ballpark as far as I’m concerned. Either way, I wasn’t paid to solve that. I was paid to get proof, and I got it.

Still, I can’t help but wonder, who’s using alchemy, and why? What’s the endgame?

I take the next exit and pull into a gas station. I grab the clipboard from the passenger seat and flip through the mold reports. Looks like every moldy shipment was signed off by the same guy. Jim Bear.

Says here he used to work in Non Con, the department for items too bulky or fragile for the conveyors.

I bet his name’s in the candle report too.

Just as I’m reaching for the next page, my phone rings. I answer without checking who it is.

“Hello?”

“Jamie! Just checking in. How’s it going?”

It’s Tommy.

How much do I tell him? I don’t want to tip my hand too early, I don’t even know how much he’s keeping from me. I hate thinking it, but I can’t rule it out.

“Is that doubt I hear in your tone, Thomas?” I say, trying to sound like I’m setting up for a punchline. “I got the proof of them ignoring protocol, and I have evidence of what might be causing it.”

“I knew you’d knock it out of the park. The client only wanted one of those, and you got both.” His voice is too smooth, like he’s testing me.

“Where do you want to meet up?” I ask, then follow up quick, “And am I getting paid on delivery, or do I have to wait for a check to clear?”

“I forgot you like things upfront. Usual spot. Coffee’s better this time of night anyway.”

When I take jobs, I have one rule. One I live and die by, trust nobody.

It stings not being able to trust Tommy. But this is a job. Personal feelings stay off the clock.

I pull into the café parking lot. With me are the mold report and the evidence box. I order two coffees and take my regular seat by the back window.

As I sip, my mind drifts, not to my mom, not to high school. This time, I think about my cousin. The one who grew up in my house. One day his mom dropped him off and never picked him up. After that, I called him my brother.

The last clear memory I have of him? I made him breakfast. It was a week after I turned eighteen. Mom had been committed to the state hospital, and we were staying with our grandparents. Once I knew I could go, I told him I had to leave. That Grandma would look after him, and Grandpa would make sure he had what he needed. I was gone before the coffee finished brewing.

I haven’t seen him since. I hoped I might at least run into him at the funeral home during Mom’s viewing. No luck. Maybe he left too.

I sigh and let the memory slip back into the dark.

The bell over the café door rings. I glance up. It’s Tommy. He’s holding an envelope with a noticeable bulge. That’s something, at least.

He walks over, we shake hands, and I motion for him to sit.

“For getting the evidence and the report, you earned a little bonus,” he says, sliding the envelope across the table.

I take it and hand over the box with the report on top.

“Thanks.”

“You’re not gonna count it? At least open it and pretend,” he says, almost whining. “Let me gloat for hooking you up.”

“This is why I don’t do business with friends,” I tell him. “I do the job, I get paid. If I count it in front of you, that’s disrespect. Like I think you’d stiff me.”

“I didn’t mean it like that,” he says, suddenly defensive.

“Then how did you mean it?”

He looks at me hard, like he’s weighing something.

“Look, you’ve been gone a long time. Nobody could get ahold of you. Things changed. The kind of jobs you want, they’re not easy to find anymore.”

“What are you talking about?” I ask, even though I don’t want to know.

“You fucked up big time when you left. That cousin of yours, the one you left at your grandparents, he sold your secrets. And not just to moody teens like you used to when you were one of them. He went to bad places. Talked to worse people. People you knew.”

I see the heat rising behind his eyes.

“Bullshit. He didn’t know anything I was doing.” The words taste bitter as they leave my mouth.

“Then why did he have a lighter!?” Tommy grabs the box and report, then stands. “I’ll call you in the morning.”

Fuck. I’m going to have to show my hand after all.

“Someone is using alchemy at that warehouse.” I just let it sit there.

Tommy sits back down and stares daggers at me. “What do you mean someone is using alchemy?”

Before there was chemistry, there was alchemy. Where witchcraft used herbs and shit for rituals, alchemy used them for their property makeups. Combine stuff and see what happens. Nine times out of ten, alchemists kill themselves breathing in poison they didn’t mean to make.

What makes alchemy as dangerous as witchcraft to me is that if one of those potions goes airborne, a lot of people could get hurt. At least with witchcraft, you're putting your own life on the line.

“I get paid to bring you evidence. I’m not paid to start spewing out theories.” I take a sip of my coffee and breathe deep, in and out. “That’s why I wasn’t going to say anything.”

“Cut the shit. You delivered and got paid. The job is done. We’re no longer speaking like we have a contract. Get me?” He punctuates the point by finally drinking the coffee I got for him when I arrived.

“Some guy named Jim Bear seems to be doing experiments. Either the boxes or the stuff in them has a mold. They get shipped with a demonic candle, and something in the wax accelerates the mold growth. Must happen when the wax heats up, even just a little.”

I can see in his eyes he’s struggling with what I’m saying. “You got all that from just one visit? Before you even clocked out for lunch, no less?”

“I used to be good at what I did, Tommy. I used to be able to step into a city and tell you how many demons influenced the population. What concoction the jackasses used to lure demons to them.” Son of a bitch. I can feel the flicker of pride trying to ignite. I better check myself. “I refuse to do that anymore. I won’t participate in it anymore.”

Tommy is quiet. Not a loss-for-words kind of quiet, but something heavier.

“Then help me expose these bastards. You made everyone think you were untouchable. Then finally, when your secret got out, everyone wanted to try and be ‘A Desert Son.’”

I didn’t even think about that. It was a stupid title I made up. Something to sound cool. Coyote said I needed a name people would remember. I didn’t think anyone would take it so serious.

“That’s dangerous and you know it.” I down the rest of my coffee and set the mug down a little too hard.

“Jaime, they already got your mom.”
