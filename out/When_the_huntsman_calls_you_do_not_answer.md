When I was around 13 years old I was walking in the woods late one night, not with any particular destination, just walking. I heard a strange sound ring out through the sky as a shadow passed overhead. It couldn't have been a bird because it was far too large, but it was definitely an animal.

It sounded as though hundreds - thousands of voices were calling out in perfect unison. I almost thought I saw the shape of a human, so I said “hello?!”, to which the large, dark form promptly dropped out of the sky with a thud.

It was a man on a horse, somehow flying only moments before; the horse was grey and enormous, sporting eight legs and fierce, dark, eyes. The man had one bright blue eye, his other covered by his hair. He wore a pointy cap, a luxurious, black, feathered cloak, and he had a beard, large, but well maintained. 

Either one would have seemed quite remarkable on their own, but together they were a confounding duo. 

“Hello, are you alright there, lad?” Said the old man. 

“I'm fine, sir, are you and your horse alright?” I replied, feeling it was appropriate to make sure that crashing from the sky, something that should have killed them, didn't leave them with any lasting injuries, but they were clearly unharmed. 

“We are fine, lad…though, may I ask you for a favor?” His voice was odd, he did not speak quite like an American, but not quite British either. 

He sounded European, but his accent was a hodge-podge of characteristics which I could not place. He sounded well-travelled, and he certainly looked old enough to have done much traveling, but he did not sound like an old man, his words were chosen carefully and deliberately, but it seemed effortless for him.

“Yes sir, anything” I said 

“Foolish child!” Barked the man, “you must promise nobody that you will do them ‘anything’, your attempts at kindness shall be your doom!” 

“My apologies, sir, what should I say?” 

“Do not apologize to me, lad, but to yourself. You should promise only to grant that which is in reason, now, may I ask you a favor?”

“Yes sir, within reason” I said.

The man nodded “good, now, take this chain” 

From the long baggy sleeve of his cloak emerged a bony hand holding a chain, but, unlike the hand, the chain was pristine. It was nearly glowing, it was so polished. I took the chain, as he asked. 

“Now, boy, I am going to test you. You have seen how my horse can travel the sky?” I nodded “good, good, so, I ask that you try to resist the force of his flight, can you do this?” 

“I- I guess I can try.” 

“Yes you can! That's the spirit.” 

The man and horse took to the sky and I wrapped the chain around a large tree. I heard the wood strain against the force, but it was enough to stop them. They returned, this time much softer.

“Good job. Very clever! Now, one more thing…” 

“Yes, of course, sir; thank you, sir.” I said, nearly grovelling.

The man got down from his horse, he was thin, but very tall, and his eye glowed in the moonlight. He approached me and placed a giant hand on my shoulder “live a good life, lad; and never stop learning.” He tipped his hat to me, mounted his steed, and soared away, leaving me with the chain, but the chain, peculiarly, had turned to solid gold.

Naturally I pawned the gold, but I kept one link, that way I know it was all real. Nobody would believe me if I told them, but this is my story.
