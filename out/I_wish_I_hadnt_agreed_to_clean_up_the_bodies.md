We’ve all heard those horrible stories about a lonely recluse passing away in a quiet void. You probably heard some version of this story at a young age. A tale about an isolated individual’s body rotting away until someone complains loud enough about a bad smell or, in more extreme cases, their bank account is drained and bill collectors/ unfortunate landlords discover a putrid corpse.

For most people, when they think about these hermit’s deaths their brains are more inclined to thinking about the emotional, philosophical aspect of what it means to rot unnoticed for weeks. However, let me ask you to consider the physical side of this decay. 

Imagine what it must look like when someone is left to rot in your average roach infested apartment. Imagine how their flesh melds to the furniture or carpet as their body stiffens. Think about how the bloat and swell of death change a corpse. How it takes away the body’s shape and color, leaving you with misshapen corpse that looks more like something that might have once pretended to be human rather than an actual person.

Now, with that in your mind, humor me and do this thought exercise. Maybe this’ll sound weird, but humor me. This past week has been one of the darkest times of my life. While I work up the nerve to explain what I have done without sugarcoating my own selfishness, let’s lighten the mood a little bit.

Try to imagine you are a landlord. You can even imagine that you are YOUR landlord if you have one. Now imagine you haven’t received rent from a particular tenant in two months. You have sent passive aggressive texts and emails and posted notices on this unit’s door, but everything has been ignored. 

You pound on your tennant’s door. No answer. You rummage around for your master key to give them a piece of your mind, about their tardiness and that pungent smell spilling into the hallway. You are certain they are ignoring you since you can hear the faint sound of television. It sounds like static. You finally find the key and are all set to barge into their apartment. 

Maybe you hesitate a little before you turn the door knob, sensing something is off, but remember you are a landlord in this scenario. Nothing is going to stop you from collecting rent. 

So, you go in and you see it. 

That horrible amalgamation of purpled flesh and rotten yellow puss that was once your tenant. Maybe you’d throw up. Maybe you’d scream. Maybe you’d cry. Maybe you’d have an emotional reaction that would almost trick people into believing you are capable of empathy, but you would very quickly remember what you are.

A landlord.

And you need to collect rent. The police and the authorities have come and collected the body. It’s been cleaned, but there is still this awful residue of death clinging to every fiber of that unit. Renovations are expensive and it’s not like you can just douse the carpet in white paint and call it a day, right? If this continues, you might have to lower the monthly payment to a reasonable rate to fill the unit. Doing that might literally kill you, so what do you do? 

You call me. 

I am a bioremediation specialist. It’s not a fabulous job by any means, but it’s mine. I inherited my practice from my late father and, along with my sister, we specialize in disinfecting and removing all traces of decay. 

What our job looks like varies day by day. Sometimes we are contracted by the police to clean closed crime scenes or to sanitize the aftermath of car accidents. Other times we will be employed by a private practice or an individual to scrub away the remaining decay from their homes or business. 

I wish I could tell you that what we do is completely legit. I wish I could tell you that I run the business the way my dad did, clean. But I can’t.

Dad did a great job teaching me and Sarah, he really did. So, don’t think I’m saying anything bad about him when I tell you what he didn’t prepare us for. For all he taught Sarah and I about the practical side of the business, we were left floundering with the actual business side of corpse removal. 

Bookkeeping, maintaining the correct amount of stock, knowing how to adjust the standard price based off services rendered, understanding when and how to outsource extra help during busy seasons. This was the type of stuff we didn’t know how to do. He probably would have taught me how to manage the company if he would have known a heart attack was going to take him far before he hit retirement age. 

Unfortunately, in our grief and ignorance, dad’s flourishing business quickly began to take a nose dive. We had to turn down emergency, time sensitive jobs. We outsourced complete beginners who swindled us. There were a thousand other little slip ups, little mistakes here and there. Even though things were bad, I told myself it wouldn’t always be that way. Sarah and I were fast learners. We grew from our mistakes and very quickly realized what needed to be done. We worked so hard. 

I thought that we could get things back on the right track, but no. Even after we got into the swing of things, no one wanted us. Both the state and local departments used to outsource us for work all the time, but now they were forming contracts with other companies.

I thought the demise of dad’s business was inevitable, until he reached out to me.

So… Liam… I’ll call him that. I started to type out how he looks, what you’d see when you look at him, what I think about him, but then I realized that saying that would be just about as telling as saying his name if anyone were to find this and connect the dots. 

If he’s still out there, I don’t want to cause any trouble for Liam. I feel in my heart that he never intended to hurt me or Sarah. Not really. 

So what can I tell you about Liam? Meet him more than once and you’ll know that he always looks immaculate. His suit never has a single wrinkle and his hair is perfectly groomed. Even though there’s something jagged and metallic about his aura, it’s easy to fall under the spell of his words and to believe he’s just trying to help you.  

I know that he had selfish reasons for approaching Sarah and I. It was to his benefit. I get that he was taking advantage of how we had fallen, but I can’t bring myself to feel angry at him. He treated us well, like family really. And that’s what Sarah and I needed. 

We didn’t immediately agree to work with him. Sarah was adamant that we shouldn’t. But I was the one who made decisions.

Liam wined and dined us, complimenting us in all the ways that I needed to hear. He talked about how it was rare to find such competent women, how proud our father would be to see us. I knew it was sweet talk, but his eyes were so genuine.

I’m sure I don’t need to spell it out for you, but Liam is part of a well known organization in my city. I don't know the details, but he’s responsible for quite a lot of work, including, as I’m sure you’ve guessed, the type of violence that ends with needing people like Sarah and myself to clean up a room. 

He said it would be easy work. He told us that we’d just be cleaning up messes left by the scum of the earth, the type of people that make it unsafe to go out alone after dark and would end up rotting in a jail cell or going on to victimize more people if they weren’t put down. He told us that as long as we stayed discreet, we could leave whenever we wanted. 

I felt like we had no other choice. If I wanted to keep working under my father’s name, we had to take his offer. But Sarah wasn’t like me. While she certainly was cordial to Liam and leaned into his kindness and gifts, she never fell under his charm. She was always smart like that, much smarter than me. 

“This has to be temporary,” she told me before we even took our first job. “Promise me that we’ll only do this until we get back on our feet. After we have enough saved up we have to go completely legit.”

I promised her. 

The first job came fast.

A shitty motel with a buzzsaw bedframe and yellowed wallpaper peeling at the corners like old scabs. The air had me tightening up my mask. It was heavy an thick, like it had been recycled through lungs and ashtrays a thousand times. Stale smoke clung to the drapes, and something acrid burned behind my eyes.

We’d been suited up in this sort of setting a thousand times before. I was sure we’d even been to this exact motel before to take care of an overdose situation. It was one of those places where no one asks questions as long as you pay in cash. We weren’t there to ask questions, either.

Just to clean.

Still, I noticed how Sarah kept fidgeting, pulling at her gloves as if there was something wrong with them. I suddenly wished I hadn’t involved her in any of this and wondered why I hadn’t chosen to carry this burden alone. I was too used to telling her everything. 

As we pushed open the bathroom door, the room that Liam had told us the body would be in, I forced all my thoughts and feelings into the situation into a compact box. I could unpack them later if I needed, but now was the time to be clinical and work.
 
The man in the bathtub wore a pair of drooping pajama bottoms. There was a thin red line across his throat—deep and clean, like someone had garroted him. In addition, he had a long, precise cut from his chest to his pelvis. Had they removed an organ/ organs post mortem?

It wasn’t the most gruesome thing we had ever seen. The body was fresh. Most of the blood and mess was confined to the tub. There was some splatter on the tiles. We would also need to check the carpet and baseboards of the room thoroughly and give them a good wash in case anything had been tracked by Liam’s men. 

Sarah stood by the door, gloved hands tight around the spray bottle. She hadn’t moved in at least a minute.

“We should call someone,” she muttered, not quite looking at the body. “This feels…”

“Don’t,” I cut in. “You can leave, but I have to finish this.”

She flinched like I’d struck her. I pretended not to notice.

I knelt near the tub, ignoring the soft gurgle of pooled fluids near the drain. The man’s face had purpled, tongue swollen, eyes glassy. The ligature mark was unmistakable—thin wire, pulled fast. No struggle, no defensive wounds. Just clean, surgical violence.

“Let’s get this over with.”

I flicked on the bathroom fan and started unpacking. I forced my eyes away from the man’s neck. I needed to focus on my work. 

“RMR-86 for the tile. Hit the cracks with peroxide after,” I said, already peeling back the shower curtain.

Sarah didn’t move.

“You think we’re helping cover this up,” I said, not looking at her.

“Are we not?” Her voice was sharp. Like she didn’t want to admit it either. “I feel like I’ve seen this guy before. With Liam.”

I glanced down at him. I thought she was being paranoid. Without a “before picture,” I didn’t think there was any way she could have recognized the strangled corpse in front of us. 

“This is a message,” she said, her hand ghosting over her neck. “They took away his voice. He’s telling us this is what will happen to us if we talk.”

“Sarah, we have nothing to say. We know nothing. We’re cleaners.” I stood and handed her a scrubber. “The blood’s already been spilled. We just get rid of the mess.”

“That’s the problem,” she said quietly. “It should still be a mess.”

Her words hung in the air for a beat too long.

I crouched again. “Sarah, if you want to call it in, go ahead. But we don’t get paid if the cops walk through this door. And I’m sure you can guess what will happen to us when they figure out how we found the body and whose payroll we’re on.”

That shut her up.

If I could go back, I’d listen to Sarah. 

We worked in silence after that. Sarah did the tub. I took the floor. Enzyme spray hissed over porcelain. Blood diluted, dissolved. The science of it was almost soothing—methodical. Sodium percarbonate for the organ foam. Solvent for the dried spatter. A steam pass to finish.

The man’s body disappeared about forty minutes in. One of Liam’s guys came by with a vinyl tarp and a blank face. 

I watched Sarah flinch when the door clicked shut.

“This isn’t who I am,” she said softly.

“I know,” I said. “This won’t change you.”

She didn’t respond.

Liam showed up right as we were done cleaning the room. He stepped into the room like he owned the building, sharp suit, clean shoes. Not a speck of dust on him.

“You two are efficient,” he hummed. “I like that. This room is probably cleaner than it was when the motel was built.”

Sarah didn’t look at him. I did.

“It’s done. Tile’s drying.”

He gave me that slow smile. “You have a real gift for this, you know.”

“I know.”

He turned to Sarah. “You okay?”

She didn’t answer. Just kept scrubbing the already clean baseboards. 

“She’s tired,” I said for her.

Liam watched her a little too long before nodding. “Let me know if she’s not up for the next one. I’ll make sure to treat you girls for a job well done.”

He reached into his wallet, pulling out several hundred dollar bills.

“You’ll still be getting the rate we discussed, but consider this a tip for all your efforts.”

He’d held the money out towards Sarah, but she still wouldn’t look at him. The set of her jaw was tense, so I smiled and got between them.

“Thank you,” I told him, taking the money.

“Of course. You’re family now and I always take care of family.”

He looked around the room again, smiling and then left, the weight of expectation left behind him.

“That hurts.” 

I looked down to see I was gripping Sarah’s shoulder. When had I grabbed her? I mumbled an apology, stuffing the money into our bag.

As I packed up the gear, Sarah finally stood.

“I don’t want to keep doing this.”

“I know. It’s not like I’m enjoying it either.”

“Then why are we here?”

I didn’t answer. Because I didn’t know how to tell her the truth—that I’d failed her as an older sister. That I’d failed our father and his legacy. That we were at the end of our rope and it was all my fault because I hadn’t known how to manage the business I’d been working at my whole life. I was almost 30 a didn’t have a single thing figured out. Dad had only been gone for less than two years and I was already ruining my baby sister’s future by plunging our business into underground work. All I could do was offer another lame apology.

She followed me out without another word.

The next job I did myself. I snuck out of the house after telling Liam I would be cleaning solo. The work was pretty similar. Another seedy motel room, quick strangulation, cut up post mortem. Since Sarah wasn’t there, I poked around the wound to see if there was a reason for the slit stomach. It looked like the liver had been removed, but nothing else. Who knows why.

Sarah and I ended up fighting when I got back. She said that dad’s business was just as much hers as it was mine and I couldn’t do this alone. She shook and cried until I promised not to go alone again. I regret that promise every day.

The next address Liam texted us was in the suburbs.

We pulled up to a one-story ranch-style house that looked like it belonged in a faded brochure for American dreamers. Perfect lawn, a tricycle still parked on the sidewalk, a flag flapping limp in the humidity. Sarah leaned against the passenger door, arms crossed, staring at the porch.

“He had a kid,” she muttered.

“He lived where people have kids,” I corrected. “We don’t know anything. Take a step back from this. We’re only here to do the same job we’ve been doing since high school.”

She’d been jittery ever since the motel job. Quiet. Restless. Kept rechecking our supply lists like something might have changed in the chemical inventory while she slept.

The door had already been unlocked when we got there. It felt strange waltzing into the house of a person I didn’t know. I felt like I should have knocked or announced my presence in spite of the situation. 

Inside, it was quiet. The entryway looked untouched, but as we made our way down the hallway, the scent hit us—burned iron and ozone. Whoever died here had done so violently.

The kitchen was the scene.

A large man, maybe mid-forties, had bled out at the dining table. Shot in the back of the head. He’d slumped forward into a plate of half-eaten eggs. His blood seemed to coat the entire room and the wound was clearly visible through his balding hair. I didn’t want to make Sarah touch the corpse, so I sent her back to the van for a different cleaning agent.

I worked quickly while she was gone. I laid out a tarp and shoved his body onto it, careless of if I damaged the body. There was a soft crack as he toppled over, likely the sound of his nose breaking, but I didn’t pause in my work. I was sure Liam wouldn’t care if the man could no longer have an open casket. I covered the man with the excess tarp, tucking him in as if he were in a sleeping bag. 

Blood had soaked through the chair slats and into the hardwood. The back wall still bore the faint arc of high-velocity spatter. Cerebral matter had dried in matte fans across the cabinets. This was going to be a lot of work. 

Sarah sat the cleaning agent down on the counter with a heavy thump.

“You okay?”

She nodded. “Just… I thought we weren’t doing this type of thing. He said it’d only be bad people. I thought this was cleanup.”

“It is. We’re not pulling triggers. Just holding the mop. We don’t know what sort of life he lived or how he managed to get on the bad side of the wrong people. We can’t pass judgement.”

“But they can?”

I didn’t respond. I thought if I kept my demeanor cold and pretended it wasn’t affecting me, Sarah would eventually leave the dirty work to me. She was smarter, but I had always been better at compartmentalization. Even though I knew what we were doing was wrong and dad would be rolling in his grave if he found out, I kept moving, thinking that this would be my darkest hour and that perseverance would lead me out of it. 

“Let’s finish this,” I said, half to her, half to myself. “We’ll start with peroxide to loosen the organ matter, then treat with hydroxide foam. You take the ceiling and backsplash. I’ll lift the laminate.”

We worked. The same rhythm we’d always had. We were good. Efficient. Surgical. I scraped at the mess around the table legs, watching how the dried blood flaked like rust. Below it, the wood had warped. I’d have to bleach, then sand. Maybe reseal. 

Sarah’s voice drifted from across the room. “He had mail on the counter. A letter from a community theater.”

I looked over. “And?”

She shrugged. “Just… doesn’t feel like a guy who pissed off the wrong people.”

“It’s not our job to think about that,” I said. “You’ll drive yourself crazy if you think about the hows and whys. Maybe he owed money. Maybe he saw something he shouldn’t have. It doesn’t matter. We’re just the cleaners. Remember what dad said after that homicide on Redgrove?”

She turned away from me and was quiet for a moment. 

“That was different,” she eventually said. “We were cleaning up the home for her son after the perpetrator had already been caught. Dad taught us we were making homes clean and livable again, that we were making a space people could make happy memories in by taking away the rot. That’s not what we’re doing here.”

She looked down at the tarp and then the picture of the family on the wall. I’d wiped the blood from it and seen their smiling faces. The dead man with his children. Would this ever be a place they could happy again? Would his sons ever be gathered around this table, laughing. The table where their father died while they were at school?

I pushed it down and stayed quiet, but the thought of the dead man’s last moment stuck with me as I sealed the floor—how close he must’ve been to finishing breakfast when the trigger was pulled. What it meant to die like that. Not in fear, but in surprise. Did he even have time to register what had happened? That he would never get to see his children again. I thought of the morning we found dad cold in bed and felt bile rising at the back of my throat. 

“We almost have enough,” I told Sarah. “We’ll be back in the black and I promise we can run it right.”

She stayed quiet.

The next job was by far the strangest. Liam had warned me that this one would be different and to be suited up as protectively as possible, but that in no way prepared me for what I was about to see. 

The house was cluttered, lived-in in a chaotic way. Strange shapes, sigils, if I had to guess, were burnt into floral wallpaper. There were books everywhere, most of them occult: titles like Invocations of the Hollow Ones, The Moon Beneath the Bone, and Severance of Self and Spirit. We had to step around faded furniture, stacks of books, and odd trinkets as if we were traversing an ill-maintained trail. The only spot in the living room devoid of clutter was the center of the room. It had been haphazardly cleared and the floor had been burnt with a strange brand.

My sister had once been into the whole spiritual witchcraft thing. Not to this level, of course. Before our lives had went wrong, she used to talk a lot about manifestations and positive vibrations. Not unusual for a girl her age. But she looked more uncomfortable than I felt in this strange room littered with gemstones, sigils, and spell books. 

Sarah froze beside a book open on a desk, her eyes scanning the runes on the page. It looked hand written. 

“Is that Greek or something?” I asked, skimming it. A few of the symbols looked vaguely familiar. Like something I might have seen in math class a decade ago or on the back of a sorority girl’s car, but not quite right. “Might be just gibberish.”

“It’s not gibberish,” she whispered. “It’s phonetic Aramaic. I don’t really know what it means, but.” She pointed to something on the page. “This symbol, it’s the same one carved into the floor, right?”

I glanced back at the center of the room and the strange sigil scorched into the hardwood, dark soot flaking from the grooves. Surrounding it were melted candles and a wide chalk ring smeared with something that looked a little too much like blood.

It looked like the same symbol to me. A strange geometric shape that curved in on itself in looping spirals that strained my eyes when I tried to follow them.

“What do you think it means?”

I didn’t answer. I was already scanning the layout. We only had the day to get the apartment clean. I stared at the scorch marks on the floor. There was melted wax puddled on every flat surface and something that looked like dried marrow smeared along the walls in uneven sigils. My fingernails itched beneath my gloves, begging to be bitten.

“This is going to take forever.” We hadn’t even seen the three bodies yet. How could this be done in a day?

Sarah picked up another book, this one also open and resting next to the scorched floor.

“Bathroom first,” I told Sarah, pulling the duffel open. “You can read that creepy shit later.”

From what I knew, Liam had sent two men to deal with the tenant. We’d be cleaning all three of them.

Sarah hung back a step after I opened the door. “Jesus.”

The woman was slumped in the tub, propped up on bones that shouldn’t have held her weight. Her spine bent in an arc so unnatural it looked splinted, like something inside her had rearranged itself mid-rigor. Her face was a frozen rictus of triumph, mouth wide, teeth cracked down the middle, gums dry and swollen. One eye had deflated and crusted over like a burnt egg; the other was barely open, a milky crescent showing beneath the lid.

But it was the smile that held the room. Fixed. Crooked. Satisfied.

Her skin had been flayed by chemical burns. Not melted in pools, but carved by intention. Lines of tissue dissolved in near-perfect spirals from her shoulders down to her hands. Her wrists were blistered to bone. Her feet were blackened stumps—one shinbone stuck through.

She hadn’t just been burned. She’d been devoured. I’d seen mishaps with both chemicals and fires, but still found myself wondering what could do this to a person.

Two others lay near her. Not collapsed. Not slumped.

Fused.

One of Liam’s guys was half-embedded into the bathroom wall, back molded into the tile as though he’d tried to claw away before he sank into it. His arms had shriveled into crooks, skin stretched tight and cracking at the elbows. His mouth had been pulled wide, cheeks eaten through until the lower jaw swung freely, half-detached. One eye was gone. The socket crawled with drying nerve ends.

The other lay on the tile floor beside the toilet, legs twisted under him like broken sticks. The flesh on his abdomen had sloughed off completely, ribs warped and wet, as if something had boiled him from the inside out. There were scorch marks around his chest cavity, but no burns on the floor beneath him.

“Fuck,” Sarah whispered. “What did she do? Homeade bomb? Acid?”

I didn’t know.

“Be careful. Whatever she used can probably eat through PPE if it can do this to skin. Use tongs.”

I moved past her and set the kit down. There was no way this was getting cleaned in one day.

“Multiple decomposition vectors,” I said, slipping into routine. “Acidic liquefaction, epidermal erosion, probable exposure to volatile compounds—maybe phosphorus or sodium hydroxide. We treat everything as a biohazard.”

I started unpacking: ammonia sprayers, neutralizers, enzyme foam, burn-resistant liner bags.

“We’ll steam the tile, double-seal the porous surfaces, scrape up the dried tissue, then flush with lye. There’s not much we can do today good the more damaged parts of the wall and tile.”

Sarah hadn’t moved.

She was still staring at the symbols on the woman’s arms.

“They look... carved,” she said. “Like she etched them herself.”

“She probably did.”

“I… I need a second,” Sarah told me. “I’ll be back.”

I just grunted in response. If I hadn’t made that promise to her, she wouldn’t be here. I hoped she would just wait in the van while I did what I could.

I reached into the tub with the scraper. The old woman’s skin crackled under the metal like overcooked fat. The tub hissed when the first drips of enzyme hit it. Thin black fluid began oozing from beneath her spine and down the drain, curling like ink in water.

“It’s still reacting,” I muttered. “Not thermal. Acidic volatility?”

Sarah had wandered into the hallway. “There’s writing on the wall out here, under the sigils. Latin, I think.” 

I didn’t look. “Sarah, I’ve got this. Why don’t you wait in the van?”

She shot me a look through the door, but it didn’t hold long. Her attention was already drifting toward the ritual circle.
 
“This burn seems deeper than it should be.”

I didn’t look at it then, too focused on scraping away the liquified bits of the woman in the tub, but I would later. In the center of that geometric sigil was a small hole, maybe two inches in diameter. It seemed to go straight through the apartment’s foundation. The hole burned straight through the hardwood at the center of the scorched ring, clean and perfectly circular. The edges weren’t just blackened—they were eaten. Flaky, flensed, as if something had bubbled up from hell itself. 

There was no scorch trail. No smoke damage. None of the things that should have been there if there had been a fire strong enough or acid corrosive enough to eat through hardwood and cement. 

There was just that black hole.

Sarah knelt beside it, staring. “We shouldn’t be here. The way those men dissolved… It doesn’t feel safe here.”

“We’ve seen worse than this.”

I heard her rummaging around, papers flipping. I tried to drown it out as I bagged what I could of the old woman.

Time passed. I kept listening for my sister, for her to choose to join me again or leave entirely, but she did neither. When Sarah spoke again her voice was low.

“She wrote the same phrase over and over again in the margins of the book. Sub ossa, sub terra, sub fame. That means ‘beneath bone, beneath earth, beneath hunger.’ And then... os est apertum. The mouth is open.”

A pause.

“I’m trying to use my phone to translate this and I think this is a ritual to call on something. It’s a sacrificial ritual to something called “The Eater.” That old woman used her death to call out to it. To wake it up. To feed it. And she brought Liam’s guys with her. If it’s awake, it’s still hungry.”

I sealed the second body bag, snapping the zip tie with a firm pull. “You need to get some air.”

“I’m not making this up.”

“I didn’t say you were.”

I looked at her then. Her face was pale, a panic present in the way her hands shook. “The Eater?” A sacrificial ritual? I thought she’d sounded crazy, that the strange looping patterns scorched into the floor and walls had bored its way into her mind, whispering thoughts of delusion.

“I need you to go to the van,” I said. “I need a couple things. Clear your head. I’ll finish up the bathroom.”

Sarah said my name. “How are you not freaked out by all this?”

“Leave,” I told her in a stern voice.

I heard Sarah suck in a deep breath, the sound of papers shuffling, perhaps the sound of her taking the book with her, and then the door slamming shut.

Scraping up the men turned out to be easier than I thought. They were practically dissolving under the cleaner. If we hadn’t been suited up so well, I would have been terrified of the chemicals we were being exposed to. As I tied off the final body bag, I heard the door creek open.

“If you have calmed down, we’ll tag the circle, record what we can’t clean, and see how Liam wants to deal with what’s left.”

As soon as Sarah stepped into the bathroom, I knew that wasn’t going to happen. She had her goggles pushed up into her hair, her respirator nowhere to be seen. Her face could have been printed inside the dictionary as a visual for the word manic.

“We need to get out of here. That ritual summons The Eater to devour the self and the enemies of the summoner. It will absorb everyone who stood against the summoner and then go on a binge until it is satiated and retreats into the Earth to sleep again.”

“Sarah. Stop. You sound crazy right now.”

She tugged at her hair like a frustrated child. “How are you still not listening to me? You saw the bodies. The Eater gets bigger and bigger with every meal. By covering up her death, don’t you think that we’re aligning ourselves against her?”

“There’s no mystery here. A little old lady into the occult used some sort of acid or bomb to make a last stand against her debtors. That’s all there is to it and we’re only here to clean the mess.”

She stared at me, jaw clenched. I looked away.

I heard the front door shut, felt the sudden stillness. 

The candles, the bowl, and the book went into their own sealed drum. I doused everything with ammonium and bleach in separate passes, wiped down my gloves between each contact point.

The goons hissed in their bags. The acid still hadn’t finished working.

As I predicted, we didn't finish the job that day. I did enough to make it look passable—wiped the walls, disposed of the obvious gore, bleached the sigil until it was just a faint scar in the floorboards with the strange hole at the center. 

I spoke to Liam before I went out to the van. He was just as flattering and understanding as ever. He told me he had another job for the morning and texted an address and a time. 

I shouldn’t have taken it. 

The house was too normal. There were crayon drawings on the fridge. A dog bowl by the back door. Toys scattered across the living room like the kids had just stepped out for a minute.

But they hadn’t. They’d been slaughtered.

It wasn’t just a hit. It was a purge. Mom, dad, two elementary school age kids. All dead. Shot with their hands and feet bound in the basement. I’m not going to describe it much more than that. Just what I’ve written now is enough to churn my stomach with guilt, but I’ll remember what I did that day for the rest of my life.

Sarah broke first. She dropped her sponge halfway through the job and sat on the floor, her gloves streaked in gore, shaking.

“We can’t do this anymore,” she said.

“I know.”

“No, listen to me. This isn’t just about keeping the business afloat. This is about us. We’re going to lose ourselves in this.”

I took a deep breath, dropping my own supplies. “I think I’m already lost.”

She looked at me with tears in her eyes. “Then let’s get you back.”

We told Liam we needed to talk.

I sat across from him at a local wine bar he liked to treat like an office. The smile he gave me when I said we were quitting didn’t reach his eyes. 

“You’ve done good work,” he said, turning his wine glass slowly by the stem. “Exceptional, actually. I’ll be honest. I wasn’t sure you two would make it this far. This started as a favor to your old man, but I’d really like to keep you in the family. Think about this carefully.”

“Liam. We’ve decided.”

He smiled. “You think that I’m just some wolf in a suit who doesn’t care. But I do. You’ve seen things. That changes a person.”

“You killed a family,” Sarah said in a broken whisper.

He tilted his head, as if hearing something far away. “I didn’t. But I understand why it happened. I’m a lot like you. I figure out how to clean up the messes.”

I was silent. 

“I’m sure you’re both anxious about what leaving means.” He leaned forward. “So, let me guarantee you a clean exit in exchange for a favor. I’ve got one more job. Then you’re out. A big one. Warehouse cleanup. Something… went wrong.”

“What kind of wrong?”

“You don’t want details, ladies, trust me. The gist is that some of my men are dead in a warehouse. The area is safe now, but I need the scene cleaned.”

Sarah gripped my hand. 

He drummed his fingers once, sharp and final. “I’ll double your usual. And I’ll give you access to the city contracts again. A clean slate.”

My heart twisted. We could be legitimate again. After everything. After all we’d lost.

I wanted to believe him, so I did. We took his offer and agreed to do one last job.

We met his contact before dawn. He wore a long, threadbare coat and didn’t bother with names. Without a word, he slipped the heavy chain from the rusted warehouse door, its links rattling with neglect, and gave us a gloved hand wave to enter. He didn’t follow us in.

Inside, the air was hot and humid. I felt myself sweating beneath my protective suit. The warehouse was a graveyard. Walls bore gruesome testimony—thick streaks of dried blood smeared in desperate arcs. Bits of flesh hung, gray and congealed, like grotesque trophies on rusted shelving units. A winding trail of ribbony flesh, slick and glistening unnervingly, led deeper into the gloom, threading between toppled pallets.

“Jesus,” Sarah whispered, voice trembling like a fragile candle flame. “How many people died here?”

“Liam said twelve. But this… this looks worse.”

We edged forward, our flashlights slicing through the darkness, sweeping over dented construction equipment, metal shelving, and broken pallets. An oily sheen clung to every surface, making the paint bubble and warp as though corroded by some unknown acid. Even the metal walls curled inward, like the building was trying to close itself off. 

At the far end of the warehouse, a heavy metal grate lay yanked open, bent back like something clawed its way up from beneath the concrete.

As we approached, I heard a soft gurgling. At first I thought it was plumbing or maybe the gore draining, but then it grew louder, stickier, like suction cups on flesh.

From the shadows below, a slick, formless goop began to bubble and pulse, thick and viscous.  It was the color of a blister, pink with faint hints of yellow. It surged upward through the grate, a slow, wet wave veined with bulging violet. Inside the gelatinous mass, teeth, strands of hair, and shattered bone drifted as if in a void. An eye floated within, blinking as it fixed its terrible gaze on us.

Sarah’s breath caught in her throat. Her hands trembled, fingers tightening into fists.

“The… the eater,” she whispered, voice barely audible. Her eyes didn’t leave the rising mass. “It’s here for us.”

That horrible amalgamation of flesh lunged forward, still growing in size as more and more pink goop bubbled from the grate. 

I grabbed my sister’s arm and we bolted.

The thing surged after us, in pursuit. It crunched and bubbled as it moved, a putrid wave of corruption licking the sides of crates and shelves, swallowing blood and flesh, even a rat scurrying in desperate flight. It absorbed everything—silencing the rat’s tiny squeal before it even began.

We reached a cluster of toppled pallets, their splintered wood jutting out like broken bones. Without thinking, Sarah jerked away to the right, bounding over a fallen crate as she made a mad dash toward the exit. I went left, pressing myself against between the cold metal shelving as I hastily sidestepped in the same direction. If I tried to jump or dodge the debris to the right, I knew I’d fall flat on my face. 

Even though I was slower moving, the eater followed her.

I had just slipped out of the shelving’s gap when I heard a resounding thud. 

“Sarah!

There was a wet, choking cry. I think it may have been the first syllable of my name, but I’ll never know.

I spun back just in time to see it drag her toward the grate, the mass rippling with a terrible hunger.

“NO!” I screamed, lunging forward, heart hammering. The thing reared up, towering and alien. I feel like it was looking at me in that moment, like it was telishing my fear and desperation. 

Then, with a final, monstrous pull, it sank back beneath the grate, pulling Sarah down with it. Her screams snapped off like a broken wire, swallowed by the dark.

And then, silence.

I sprinted to the grate and stuck my arm in, feeling nothing, and screaming for my sister. I was about to throw my body into the hole. Adrenaline flooded my body and I had no thoughts other than descending into the depths and fighting that wretched mass of flesh for my sister, but something grabbed me from behind. Before I could lash out, I heard a familiar voice.

“Whoa. Slow down.” It was Liam. “Where’s your sister?”

I could barely calm myself enough to explain what had happened. Liam didn’t look like he believed me, but he took my flashlight and tried to look in the grate. It seemingly didn’t have a bottom. He dropped a penny in and we never heard it.

He pulled me away from the hole, keeping a firm grip on my arm as if I might dart towards it.
 
“I need to get her back,” I sobbed.

He gave me a smile I hadn’t seen before. A tight one. Uncomfortable. “We will.”

His men were there soon enough. One wrapped me in a warm blanket, like I had been in a hurricane or something. Liam made me tell my story a thousand times to different people before driving me home. 

I heard two of them talking. They thought Sarah had fallen in and I was saying crazy shit due to trauma. 

People were coming now with rope and machinery. I wanted to stay so badly, to get Sarah back, to apologize to her and tell her she had been right, but they wouldn’t let me.

“I never would have let you girls be here if it wasn’t safe.” Liam had said, physically restraining me from going back into the warehouse. 

His grip on my arm was firm and strong. I’d been lifting bodies since I was a teenager, but I could tell there was no point struggling against him. He was stronger. 

“You have to go home.”

He told me that he’d be looking into that hole and that he would get Sarah back.

That was two weeks ago. I haven’t been able to get up with Liam nor anyone connected to him since. In desperation, I tried going to the police. They thought I was hysterical. One detective made a joke about bath salts. 

I showed them the warehouse. It was empty. Clean.

No blood. No bodies. The grate secured to the floor, like nothing had ever happened there.

Sarah was gone.

Late at night, I lay awake. If I’m very still, I think I can here something moving beneath  the floorboards. A slurping, wet sound, like something hungry moving through the pipes.
