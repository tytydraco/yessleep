At least, that’s what he told us every night at the dinner table.

He was a physics professor at the state university but had become deeply involved in the occult over the last few years. He set up an office in our garage, convinced he had found a clue in the Bible leading to something significant.

“Isaiah 66:1 has always been clear, but humanity never listened, my dear Alice,” he would say to me, his eyes unnervingly intense. ”God is in the skies, and if science searches among the stars, it will find Him.”

His office had a powerful radio with a huge antenna, an optical telescope, and three old laptops, operating non-stop with mysterious software. My mother always suspected he had stolen the equipment from the university lab.

She was the silent victim of his obsession, trying to remain understanding and patient, hoping he would return to normal. My siblings and I, however, were in high school at the time and had grown tired of hearing that our father was nuts.

Other kids thought we were eccentric, seeing my dad taking his telescope down the street at dusk, trying to get the best angle of Venus, always wearing the same clothes the whole week. I hated it.

One morning, we all woke at 5am to his shouting from the garage.

He was jumping with excitement over a new signal he had received. “It’s undeniable proof that He is out there!” he told us, his hair and beard wild and untrimmed for months.

We didn’t share his enthusiasm. Maybe he had finally lost his mind. He had found signals before, and they had always turned out to be satellite noise.

“So, how’s the signal, Dad?” one of my brothers asked the next morning. He answered nothing, just refilled his coffee and walked back to his office. Another dead end, we all assumed.

The day after that, a Saturday, I was really excited about a night birthday party I was invited to. A boy I had a crush on was going to be there.

But in the afternoon, my father called us all to the living room, his face urgent.

“He knows we are here,” he muttered, pacing frantically. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days. “We must all stay inside this weekend.”

“Who knows?” my mother asked, uneasy.

"God, honey," he said, gripping her shoulder. "The Creator of the universe knows we’re here and told us to stay put. I’m sure He’s going to bless us, or tell something important."

"Dad, not today, please," I protested, rolling my eyes. "I have a birthday party tonight. I can’t just stay home."

"No one is leaving this house today!" he commanded, his voice taking on an authority I had never heard before. "We must stay together. Trust me, you’ll understand soon, honey."

Frustrated, I tried to argue back to no success. Desperate, I looked at my mother, but she was too stunned by the idea that her husband might actually be insane to say a word.

I stormed back to my room in a fit of rage and slammed the door shut. This wasn’t fair, and I wouldn’t let my father’s madness ruin my social life.

That night, after dinner, I locked myself in my room and waited until it was late enough for me to sneak out through the window. The party was only two blocks away, so I just walked there.

And the party was great. It was fun, and my crush and I had the chance to talk for hours, though nothing romantic happened.

Around 2 or 3 am, I checked my phone - it had been on silent the whole time. There were multiple missed calls and messages from my mom.

Dozens of messages like: COME HOME NOW. PICK UP THE PHONE. GET HERE NOW.

I replied, telling her I was only two blocks away and on my way back. I knew I’d be grounded for this, but it felt worth it.

As I walked home, I kept checking my phone for a response, but her number was offline. I assumed they had gone back to sleep.

When I reached my house, I slowly stepped inside, trying to be as quiet as possible. I expected to find my mother in the living room with a look of disapproval, but no one was there.

I drank some water and headed to my room. The first strange thing I noticed was that my siblings' bedroom door was open. When I peeked inside, I saw that the room was empty. Where the hell were they at 3 a.m.?

Then, I walked to my parents' bedroom, and their door was also open. No one was inside.

I searched the entire house, but they were nowhere to be found. The car was still in the garage, so they couldn’t have just driven off somewhere.

I tried calling every single one of them over and over again, but their phones were off. 

Every member of my family was simply gone, and the truth is, I never saw them again.

They were never found.

\*\*\*

The case of their disappearance was in every newspaper in the state for days after, mobilizing the entire town in an effort to find them. The neighbors' security cameras didn’t capture any movement or anything suspicious that night. No one passed by the street the night of the event. They simply vanished.

Then, the feds arrived to investigate a week later. Tall men in black suits and dark glasses combed through the area for a few days, and left without revealing a single word to the public.

Strangely, the media stopped covering it the very next day. It was like nothing had ever happened. Over time, this case was only mentioned in podcasts or mystery YouTube channels.  
  
After all that, I went to live with my grandparents and they took good care of me, but the trauma never faded.

Fifteen years have passed, and no one has come even close to explaining what took my family away.

Every night, I stare at the sky, wondering if it was really God who took them… or was it *something else.*
