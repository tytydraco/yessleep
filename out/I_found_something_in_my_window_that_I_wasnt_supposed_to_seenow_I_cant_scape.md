It all started with the window.

At first I thought I was just being paranoid but the more I think about it, the less certain I become. 

One day I was in my apartment hanging out in my parents’ room when I noticed the window and curtains where the wide open. The sunlight was so bright it hurt my eyes. That’s when it hit me: being on a second floor (or first floor if you call the first one “ground floor”) everyone could see me from outside and I would never notice. A chill ran down my spine, feeling completely exposed. 
I quickly shut the window, lathered the mosquito screen and left the room.

It was summer so my parents were working most of the day leaving me home alone. I figured a walk to the par could help me freshen up.

I sat on a swing kicking my legs back and forth while reading the book I brought: “the gift of fear” I saw it recommended here on Reddit, it’s about spotting danger before it happens by trusting your primal intuition: those creeping feelings under your sin for not obvious reason, those gut feelings like the ticking sensation of swinging too high. I know about those, specially recently. What better time to start reading it than now?

The park was lively with many (suspects) people walking by and the hum of conversations filling the air. I heard from behind a woman rushing over “daisy, be careful!” she said. I instinctively turned around waiting to see my own mom scolding me but it was another mom talking to another girl who shared my first name.
 
As the sun dipper lower, casting long shadows, I decided it was time to head back home. When I stood up, I noticed someone who made my heart sink: at the far edge of the park, a woman  —maybe in her 30s— whose hair was as unnaturally white as her skin. She was sitting on the beach, perfectly, impossibly motionless. 

I took a deep breath and tried to ignore it. Not everything is a gut feeling and this was probably nothing, just someone resting and enjoying herself like me. However when I passed by I couldn’t help but glance at her, and mi heart sank again. there she was, still as quiet as a doll, watching me. 

When I got home —usually so noisy now early quiet— the thought of the window lingered in my mind. I went straight to my parents’ room and there it was: wide open again. My stomach turned. I was SURE id closed it, which reminded me of a creepy story id read once: “during my lifetime in this house, I have closed more doors than I have opened” instant chills.
 
I closed it again, very carefully this time, and went to take my night shower trying to convince myself my memory was playing tricks at me. When I returned I went to grab a towel from my parents closet and slipped into a spot where I couldn’t be seen for the window so I could get dressed in peace. 

That’s when I heard a metallic click coming from the window, my heart raced as I crept closer. From where I was standing, all I could see was some shiny object at the windows height. 

Was… was that the ladder from the first floor?

I wrapped myself in the towel and hurried to look but I only saw a teenager girl - maybe 15 years old- hurrying down the last steps of the ladder to the first floor yard, where a group of girls her age where whispering among themselves. I could make out just one word “quickly!” 

Those neighbors had always felt off, like they were a little too quiet. Since we moved in, I’d never seen them step outside, not even once. Their windows were always dim, lie if the light didn’t quite reach inside. Once or twice I overhead my parents talking about strange run-ins with them: odd conversations that always ended too quickly, awkward silences than left a strange vibe, etc. 

It was bizarre but I never thought it could mean anything. 

I never thought THEY could mean anything.
 
Maybe the book was making me paranoid but after that weird window encounter, questions started to arise:

Could they have come up here just to spy us?

It was all just some childish prank?

But why open the entire window?

Why bother with the mosquito screen?

Had they been inside the house?

The more I thought about it the more uneasy I felt. It became undeniable that something strange was happening. Every part of me screamed that something dark, twisted and silent had been unfolding for a long time, slipping past unnoticed, yet continuing right under our noses. 

a cold chill spread over me when I realized my gut feeling was right: I was definitely being watched, and maybe not only from the outside. 

So I decided to make a plan. 

The next night, at around the same time that the last one, I hid near the window. When I heard the metallic sound again, I waited right bellowed and waited till I felt an unwanted guest pressing against the window frame, then I stood up. 

I came face to face with the same girl of the day before – the neighbors’ daughter, probably – Her face left me breathless. I found myself mimicking her deer-caught-in-headlights expression. She was like a negative image of me: exactly the same with inverted colors. Her skin and hair were as dark as the night, a hypnotic contrast with her pale, almost translucent, blue eyes. 

 The situation was so surreal all I could blunt out was:

“Hi?”

“Hi Daisy” she forced a smile that no longer carried the nervousness of someone caught red-handed. Now it was a grin—a smug satisfaction from someone who is going to really enjoy what happens next. 

That’s when I knew I was in trouble.

Suddenly she grabbed my wrist and slammed it against the frame. The metal dug deeply, marking my sensitive skin as I tried to pull away but her grip was iron. Her unblinking pale eyes brimmed with a fury that felt far too vast for her young face.

“So, you like throwing your trash in our bins, huh?” she hissed. 

Her question was so utterly absurd it made me dizzy, as though the world itself had tilted.

“I counted six bags,” she continued. “So why don’t we hang them here, on your window?”

Before I could process it, she pulled out bags from behind her and began hanging them on the windowsill. The plastic sound cut through the beeping in my ears. One bag, two, three…The rancid stench was the worst I’d ever smelled in my life.

“I-it wasn’t me! Please, look at me!” I gasped. “I’m only a few years older than you! I never take out the trash! Blame my parents, but not me!”

It was true, but she wasn’t listening. Her eyes were empty, as if she were lost in some kind of trance. With one final, almost mechanical movement, she finished hanging the last bag, its contents spilled slightly over the edge of the sill.

 She leaned back to admire her work and, for a second, loosened her grip on my wrist. That instant was enough- I pulled my arm away and staggered back, my mind a whirlwind of confusion and fear.

I couldn’t move fast enough. I ran. I screamed for my dad.

Luckily, it was his day off. I blurted out everything. He didn’t hesitate. He marched straight to their house.

“Shit,” I heard the girl mutter from the window, followed by quick footsteps. Her voice carried the same nervousness she had when I first surprised her.

There seemed to be a commotion down there, so i hurried to look. From the window, I saw her shouting to the same group of girls: “Someone stop him! It’s almost midnight!”

For the window, I saw my dad being greeted by an old woman in a wheelchair who came out of the house. Her twisted frame and hunched shoulders made my skin crawl. 

 Suddenly, I felt an overwhelming urge to stop my dad, so I ran downstairs. But to my horror, it was too late.  She reached out to him, her frail hand trembling, and time seemed to freeze as they made contact.  

It all happened so slowly, yet so fast. 
 
I looked at her ancient, disfigured face, and somehow in her twisted lines and shadowed contours, I found all the answers to my questions. I knew exactly what was going to happen. It was as clear as the window’s glass.

  In that moment, I felt as if I were also falling into a hypnotic trance. The world around me blurred, like she was the only existing thing in the universe. 

 That woman possessed a dark, ancient power, so old that nobody could say how many centuries it had walked among us. Perhaps it was older than time itself. And this was a ritual steeped in vile and unspeakable darkness. By touching my dad under the full moon at midnight, the life bled from his body into hers, leaving behind a hollow, lifeless shell.  

My mind immediately conjured the vivid image of my father’s heart stopping inside his chess and his body falling like a rock sinking in the river under the cold light of the moon, but to my surprise he didn’t drop death at the spot. 

Instead, his body began to shake and twist.
