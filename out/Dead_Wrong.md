I should start by telling you I'm a vampire. Not one of those beautiful, glittering creatures. No, I'm an ugly, snarling, Nosferatu. My existence is a carefully guarded secret, for I cannot move freely among the living. My dark crypt is my home, my sanctuary, my prison.

Time passes, and I do not notice. The world has completely changed all around me, yet all I can do is eat and slumber in my coffin, unaware of the world above. The ancient castle that houses my resting place stands silent under the harsh light of day.

Hunting grows ever more challenging as the world changes, and my grotesque visage—more corpse than human—makes subtlety a necessity. Unlike my alluring vampire kin, who can glide through high society with ease, I cannot rely on charm. My survival depends on ingenuity, a skill honed long before death when I was a robber baron, fattening myself on the labor of those beneath me. Now, as then, I thrive by exploiting the weak, the desperate, and the invisible.

The villagers, wary of my predations, have fortified their homes with crosses and lines of salt. Yet hunger is a powerful motivator, and I have devised a variety of methods to secure sustenance. My network of grave diggers and mortuary workers ensures a steady, if unremarkable, supply of "misplaced" bodies before burial. These same accomplices alert me to travelers passing through, their greed as reliable as the peasant bribes I once distributed to silence discontent.

During stormy nights, I sabotage the monastery’s bell tower, leaving travelers without its guiding chime. Lost in the fog, they stumble into the woods and, eventually, into my waiting embrace. For those who evade the forest, my human servants play their role. Disguised as highway robbers, they drive victims to my castle under the guise of offering sanctuary. It is an ironic tragedy—fleeing thieves only to face a true monster. Occasionally, I let my servants keep the spoils as a reminder that loyalty, even to a predator, has its rewards.

The postal service, too, has become a boon. By diverting mail coaches onto treacherous mountain passes, I ensure a steady supply of stranded travelers. My servants, appearing as benevolent rescuers, bring these waylaid souls to me.

In times of plague, I masquerade as a foreign doctor, my disfigurement explained away as scars from some distant battle. The sick and dying welcome me, blind to the danger in their desperation. They barely notice when another weak member of their household succumbs, and I leave them with promises of false hope.

The orphanage has proven a particularly fruitful partnership. Its headmaster, drowning in gambling debts, sends me sickly children deemed too frail to survive the winter. The church accepts his explanations without question, never asking why so many of the bodies are unfit for viewing. It is a macabre echo of my mortal days, when a well-placed bribe could erase any inconvenient peasant or problem.

Each method requires patience, calculation, and a mastery of deception. Unlike my handsome kin, who dance effortlessly through glittering ballrooms, I rely on schemes born of necessity. Yet, there is a satisfaction in this careful manipulation—a predator’s pride in its perfected hunt. Eternity grants me the luxury of time to adapt and refine my methods, even as superstition and science shape the world above.

Perhaps my hideousness is a blessing in disguise. Who would suspect the ghoulish outcast, too monstrous for polite society, of orchestrating such misfortunes? In a world obsessed with appearances, invisibility can be a most useful tool.

Suddenly, the peace is shattered by the arrival of three vampire hunters. First through the door is a weathered mountain of a man whose monastery-trained muscles strain against his black cassock. A leather bandolier crosses his chest, laden with wooden stakes and glass vials of holy water. Behind him slinks a ghoulishly thin scholar whose wire-rimmed spectacles catch the lamplight as he consults a tomb of vampire lore clutched in his ink-stained hands. Bringing up the rear is a woman, her silver-streaked black hair pulled tight beneath a man's hunting cap, she holds a crossbow loaded with blessed bolts held ready in calloused hands.

Their footsteps echo through the halls as they make their way deeper into the castle's bowels, closer to my sanctuary. The crypt door creaks open, and I hear their hushed voices as they approach my coffin. With a grunt of effort, they pry open the lid, exposing my corpse-like form to the dim light of their lanterns. My gray, mottled skin stretches tight across my skull, lipless mouth revealing yellowed fangs even in repose. What follows is a debate that would chill the blood of any living being - a discussion on how best to destroy me.

"We need to behead it first," one hunter whispers urgently, gripping a silver-hilted blade. "Then stake it to the coffin so it can't rise."

"You're a fool," snarls another, his weathered face twisted with scorn. "The head must remain attached - how else will the holy wafers work? We need to fill its mouth while it's still whole."

"Both of you know nothing," cuts in a third, her scarred hands tightening around a crossbow. "In my village, we learned the hard way. The only sure method is burial at a crossroads. The constant traffic keeps the ground compacted, traps them forever."

"Your village?" scoffs a younger hunter, striking flint against steel. "The same one that lost three families last winter to a fledgling vampire? No, fire is the only way. We burn it to ashes and scatter them in the river's current."

"The river?" A sharp voice rises from the back of the group. "So it can seep into the water table? Poison the wells? Have you learned nothing from the Budapest Incident?"

The oldest among them pushes through the arguing group, his beard streaked with gray. "In sixty years of hunting, I've seen them rise from fire, water, and consecrated ground alike. There's only one sure way - bury them face down."

"Face down?" Several voices clash in disbelief.

"Aye," the elder nods grimly. "When they wake, driven by unholy hunger, they'll dig downward instead of up. By the time they realize their mistake, the sun will have long since found them."

As they argue, their voices grow louder, echoing through the crypt. Unbeknownst to them, their noise has attracted attention - my brethren, other vampires hidden in the shadows, silently creeping up behind the oblivious hunters.

Just as the debate reaches its peak, I sit up in my coffin, fully awake and very much undead. The hunters freeze, terror etched on their faces as they realize their fatal mistake. From the shadows emerge my brethren: Alexandru, once a Wallachian prince, his aristocratic bearing unmarred by the centuries of decay that have left his flesh a tapestry of desiccated patches and exposed sinew. Behind him glides Sister Marie, a former nun whose transformation twisted her features into something vulpine and cruel, her habit now a rotting shroud that trails black ichor. Finally, there's The Collector, as we call him – none know his true name or age, but his patchwork body bears the stitched-together features of his favorite victims, a grotesque collage of stolen beauty.

The third hunter turns to me and brandishes a crucifix, but it's too late. With one swipe of my elongated, razor-sharp claws, I completely remove the woman’s head. A fountain of blood springs forth from her torso as her holy water spills uselessly across the ground. Alexandru descends upon the cleric with precision, his movements as elegant as any court dance as he brutally tears out the priest's throat. Sister Marie takes special delight in the academic, perhaps remembering her own days of scholarly pursuit – she lets him almost reach the door before pouncing, her unnaturally wide jaws unhinging to deliver the fatal bite.

As the last echoes of combat fade away, we gather in the great hall, our figures casting no reflections in the tarnished mirrors. The remnants of our unwelcome visitors cool on the flagstones below as we debate how to prevent future intrusions.

"We should dig a moat," hisses Alexandru, his noble bearing unchanged despite the fresh blood staining his elaborate waistcoat. "Fill it with things that hunger as we do. I know of a merchant in Constantinople who trades in crocodiles. The beasts could feast on trespassers during daylight hours."

Sister Marie's laugh echoes through the chamber, a sound like breaking glass. "Such exotic measures are unnecessary, my prince." Her twisted fingers gesture at the bloody mess below. "We need more living servants. Proper ones, bound by blood and gold. Guards during daylight, eyes in the village, tongues in the taverns to warn us of approaching threats."

"Both fine suggestions," The Collector interrupts, adjusting the stitching at his neck where his latest acquired feature is still settling into place, "but I favor more... artistic measures." He extends a mismatched arm toward the ceiling. "Let us create a labyrinth. I've seen such works in Italy – false passages, trap doors, rooms that flood with the pull of a lever. We could make the very architecture our weapon."

From my position by the hearth, I watch as centuries of personality clash and combine. "The castle itself already holds many secrets," I remind them, running a claw along the ancient stones. "Perhaps we should simply learn to use what we have. The dungeons connect to natural caves that run for miles. We could seed them with coffins, create multiple lairs."

Sister Marie's vulpine features twist in contemplation. "We could cultivate the grounds as well. I remember from my mortal days how certain plants can be quite deadly. Nightshade, wolfsbane, thorny brambles to snag and tear. Nature itself could be our guardian."

"What we need," Alexandru declares with aristocratic certainty, "is to spread confusion among our enemies." He paces the chamber, his decaying fingers tracing patterns in the air. "Let us plant false weaknesses. If they believe silver is our bane instead of wood, let them waste time gathering amulets and bullets that will do nothing. If they think running water bars our path, let them exhaust themselves hauling holy water when simple stakes would serve."

The Collector nods, his patchwork face shifting in the candlelight. "And we should vary our resting places. Never sleep in the same coffin twice in a fortnight. They cannot drive a stake through our hearts if they cannot find them."

As we debate, the first hints of dawn begin to creep across the sky. I raise my hand for silence, and my brethren still themselves. I turn to face them fully, my lipless mouth stretching in what passes for a smile. "We have survived centuries of persecution. We shall adapt, as we always have."

We retreat to our coffins as the sun threatens the horizon, leaving behind the cooling corpses of our would-be executioners. Tomorrow night, we begin our work. The hunters will come again – they always do. But next time, we will be ready. After all, what is time to the undead? We have eternity to perfect our defenses, and unlike our prey, we need only succeed every time. They need only fail once.
