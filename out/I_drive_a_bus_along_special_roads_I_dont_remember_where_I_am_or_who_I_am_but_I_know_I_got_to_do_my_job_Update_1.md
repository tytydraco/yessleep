When I woke up this morning, I thought it’d be a good day. I know, yesterday was pretty feather-ruffling, but I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t been shaken plenty of times before. But I always had to push past that shake-up, put my hat on, clean my glasses so I could see the road.

I always start the day by looking through the payment I’ve gotten from the box. There’s a reason it counts, no matter what it is. I don’t use money, at least, not regularly. I don’t really know what to use it for half the time if someone gives it to me, and it’s not always consistent what I can and cannot get with it, except at the gates.

It counts because I care about my passengers. My job is quite frightening sometimes. Other times, it’s uncomfortable. There’s even been moments where it’s been utterly hopeless. Where I just keep driving, and driving, and for a while it doesn’t seem like enough people are getting where they need to go. Where it feels like-

Anyway, I sort through the stuff every morning. If it goes missing, it doesn’t really matter anymore, since it had been important during the ride, and I don’t make long term arrangements with my passengers rarely if ever. One payment per ride. So there’s no hiccups later. There’s a whole shebang worth of trinkets. Books. Notes. Toys, random knick knacks. Clothes, currency that I don’t think was ever really used around here. Snow globes. I really like the globes. Someone has even put a whole dang computer in the box, more than once. Or phones.

The box is pretty big now. I got empty extras just in case. My bus is a bit wider than most, I think. I can fit about three full cardboard boxes in the space between me and the door. It’s all wonderful to me, even the things I never really quite figured out as to what they were. It means someone needed to go somewhere, they did their best to make it worth my while, and that matters. Even if they don’t quite know what to give me. They’re in luck, really, since I’ve no idea what I’d ask for.

I’ve tried to use the computers before, once or twice, in some of the buildings around the between that look like they might support it. I’ve gotten help, usually. I may not know how long it’s been, but the few times something almost bobbed up to my noggin, it usually didn’t include computers. I feel like what comes up, on them and the phones, is different from what it is elsewhere. Past the gates, maybe. Very garbled and confusing, but sometimes it feels prudent to keep up with the local goings on, even if the glimpses I get don’t always make sense.

Okay. Rambling. Sorry. Sometimes I just go on and on when I get nervous, or something shakes me real bad. Today was one of those days. But I gotta record. There’s no world where it would be something that’d be okay to bury.

So, the day’s events. That morning I looked through the boxes. Was feeling a bit wistful, was trying to cheer myself up by remembering the ones who’d gotten where they were supposed to, give myself some gumption by remembering what happened if they didn’t. That blue ball, that stupid little thing, it almost taunted me, felt like. I threw it against the wall, all frustrated, and it bounced right back and smacked me in the forehead. Didn’t hurt me badly or anything, but it looked like someone had given my forehead a big hard slap.

I noticed the little paper slips had actually done the thing I was told they would. I’ve no idea who sent them. I’ve no idea if it was you, or old passengers. Locals, people beyond the wall. I think, maybe, it was a mix of both. I like to think someone out there is listening to these, and trying to encourage me.

Some of them talked about things I didn’t understand at all from the first few words, so I didn’t bother trying too hard. Others, I think, really must’ve come from someone I’d given a ride to. Not too many details, even once people got past the wall they could be a bit finicky on details, and you never quite knew what would hold power in the between. A lot of them had to come back out, some of them often. Some, maybe, can’t bring themselves to fully trust me, but that’s fine. They don’t owe me that.

God. It always hurts, when I have to drive someone back because they don’t want to be on the other side anymore. I can drive someone through rain, sleet, hail and hell, and they can still be rejected when-

No, never mind. I don’t want to get too distracted. So I saw these strung up letters, and I smiled at some of them, others I frowned at. I replied to each of them, the ones that made sense, at least. I’d made a mental note to talk to the Mailman when I saw him next. He’s in charge of letters around the between, you see. Someone’s gotta make sure things like that get all the way through, process' em. He’d given me the gift. Sometimes, I have to help him make deliveries, and he’s always polite about it. I trade with him a lot, him and the Milkman, and the Policeman.

Shit. Used to, that last one. Used to. He’s gotten… Feisty, lately.

So I finish attaching my little notes to everyone else’s with clips, right? Then I see the one I missed, and my blood runs cold.

It says “I’m sorry I killed them”.

Now, I was pretty puzzled. Who killed who? Then I picked up the little blue ball from the floor, squeezed it hard. I think I was trying to settle the tremble that took over my whole dang arm. I couldn’t tell you if I was angry, or shaking in my boots, or both, but I think I had one of my moments.

Only one person died yesterday. At least, far as I could tell. I say as far as I could tell, because I’m still not sure what happened. All I know is I let those deer, and my frustration, color me blind enough I didn’t notice one of my passengers either changed, or was replaced, or who knows what.

I have a bad habit, I’ll admit. I think it’s a coping thing. If something goes real wrong, and I don’t know what to do, sometimes I’ll get a little stupid. Try to blame someone else for something that needs no blame being assigned. Usually I catch myself, since it can affect my work directly in ways no one needs. Not me or the people who ride with me.

But this time, I didn’t.

The first one who got on my bus that day, once I’d made myself proper and gotten myself breakfast, was that waterfaring sort who’d been looking at me last night. I was sitting there with a carton of milk. Was in what I think is the old style. I think it might’ve been normal when I grew up? Or maybe it still was. The Milkman tries to keep people, especially the easily confused sorts, up to date on particularly dangerous sorts, or let people know when someone needs to be found. So, if he can, he’ll put their mugs, or at least a description, on the side of his cartons. It’s good cause, so he doesn’t get in trouble.

The Policeman was the face on display right today, as he often was. It made me feel a little down, so I was a bit gruff when she got on. I didn’t get any less gruff when I noticed not only was she sopping wet still, and so she tracked water onto my bus, but she was wearing the coat and the hat. And she put a camera into my box.

I looked her right in her glowing orbs, and I said. “Good day, miss.” With a real unacceptable tone, even though she’d paid me right as rain. I tipped my hat a bit passive aggressively, and I think maybe she frowned - hard to tell, her lips were a bit oddly shaped, lot of teeth - before she went to go sit down far in the back.

I didn’t even ask where she wanted to go till I was already driving, and I could hear her croaky breathing like a heart beat when I started. That put my head back on right. I can’t just go wherever once someone gets on, unless I’ve somehow got a distinct impression they don’t care, or they tell me they don’t really mind where they end up. Doesn’t happen often, sometimes you get exploratory types, but I can’t do it.

Last time I did, I was off the map for a decent bit of time. I don’t remember how long, or quite where the road had taken me. But I must’ve zoned out. Maybe I’d been sick. Since I must’ve driven for a while, since I didn’t come back for…

Sorry, give me a second. I need to breathe.

Okay.

So, I ask her where she wants to go. “Where we headed to?” Real clipped, absolute son of a bitch tone. Even if she’d been rude as could be herself, called me some names or whatnot, which she hadn’t, you don’t talk to someone like that unless they’re a real bastard. I started catching myself, kinda looked at myself in the mirror and said ‘Driver, you drive this vehicle like a sir, not a goon’. So I smiled, and I don’t think she liked how I smiled. It took her a minute to answer. During that minute, I noticed something was… Well, not quite right about how she looked in the mirror. She was blurry. Stretched.

“Gates. Please.” She burbled out, eventually.

So I drove. Tall trees passed us by, the dark river vanishing into the rear view. The bridge, old and bricky, watched us go. I watched out for the deer, still. It didn’t escape my mind that the passenger who’d alerted me to them had mentioned them throwing themselves into headlights. I did actually see one, here or there. But they didn’t bother me. I wondered if maybe they’d taken the red ball. I slow drove by one closer to the road, even, hoping to see it trying to eat the red rubber like it was a fruit.

I didn’t. And that perturbed me, somehow. I think I wanted the easy answer. After that, we drove through some desert. I asked her which gates, after a bit. I was a bit more towards the middle of that between space now, so there were a lot of walls to go towards. I have a weather vane on top of my bus, with a second mirror on the bus’s nose that, if I crane my neck, I can see the vane through. It was pointing west, roughly, so that meant the white bright place was that way. Any other direction, the walls.

“East.” She answered, looking out the window. It was the same way my previous passenger had been going, and the same way the thing that might or might not have been his ghost or twin or replacement, or killer or whatever it had been, had gone. I shouldn’t have let it happen, but I kept getting suspicious. I’d seen all her important features, the ones that needed to be inside the vehicle at all times. She didn’t seem like she’d forgotten anything, she’d paid.

Here’s the thing. If they do all of that, and they don’t do anything completely off the bat mid-drive, I’m obligated to get someone to their destination. When I was younger, I’d say no a lot more often when I didn’t have the right anymore. Things started following me when I did. I did myself wrong and I did others wrong, so I stopped being a fool like that. I can eject anyone whenever I want, more or less, if they fail to adhere to rules. I can stop to pick up others, or make important stops, or rest whenever I want either way, but they need to get there.

Unless the payment stops feeling… Paid, so to speak. I think, maybe, I should do more trading. So that dynamic stops existing. Then again, I could probably not take on near as many passengers if I got all material and dropped the sentiment.

“East it is.” I muttered out. I looked her in the eye again, through the rear view. Held it till she stopped returning it. Real rude of me, but it wasn’t just pettiness that time. I wanted to make sure. Make sure I hadn’t imagined the eye contact the first time.

I tried to muster something measured, reasonably friendly, into my voice the next thing I said. “So… May I ask something?” Then, I clarified. Nobody answered those types of questions around here, unless they were people from the gates. Green-pants, specially, or people who didn’t know the more particular rules. “Er, that is… Can I ask about your coat. And the… Payment.”

She looked at me, turned her eyes from the road. Made some kinda gurgling noise. “Sure.”

“Where’d you get them?” I squeezed the wheel. Knuckles went a little white. Squeezed harder when she took a bit to answer, said it so quiet I almost couldn’t hear. And I’ve got good ears, y’know. Wouldn’t be alive still if I didn’t. Getting old ain’t an excuse to not pay attention.

“I found the… Rain garment in the river. And the camera… Trade. You seemed interested in the picture making.” Her voice was low, a bit off.

“The… Picture making. Could you clarify?” I glanced at her through the rear view, tried to seem less interested than I was.

“I saw someone… Click at you. You seemed interested. Was I… Wrong?” She sounded all half-flustered, but also something else. Her breathing got odd again. I saw her tense up.

I realized I was being real harsh. I let myself breathe, drove quietly for a bit. Then I asked. “Do you think… It was someone up to no good?” The way I phrased it was important. Some people just know when you’re talking about them. I hear that doesn’t happen beyond the walls. Or, least, they can’t do much about it when they get the tingle. But here… Out here… Good cause, or you might lose your tongue alongside your manners, if you get my hint.

“Don’t know. He kind of had a hat like yours. Were they… An acquaintance?”

She didn’t say friend, so she was uncertain. Easy way to trick someone into letting someone in, you know. I’ve seen it done plenty of times, even fell for it a handful. “I don’t know. There’s a few folk like me around.”

“Human?”

I paused. Drove real quiet again. If something had wanted to sneak up on me, right then, they could’ve easily just done it. I wouldn’t see anything before it happened. I gripped the wheel. “I… I think so.” My gut said yes. My noggin being real clear, or misty, on so many things said ‘it’s in question’, like an 8-ball.

“Oh. Maybe you can’t tell me, then.”

“Tell you what?”

“Do you think they’ll… Like me, on the other side? I’ve practiced.”

“Well, what’re you going over for?”

“I want to see the real ocean before it goes away.”

I didn’t know what to make of that. There was a few big bodies of water around the between, but I couldn’t tell you if they were big enough to count as an ocean. The good ones, the really truthful passengers, don’t really lie about much knowingly. Technically, you can lie as much as you want, though not about some things. All your little bad manners and bad habits build up eventually, then a particular set of people might take notice, if the rest of the world doesn’t remind you first. Though, you have to pull some real nonsense to get to that point, or a hell of a lot of little nonsense.

“I’m… Sure you will. They might like you. You seem well enough. But, I can’t really tell you for truth. I kinda… I lost my feel for that sort of thing. Been out here too long. Hard to discriminate now, off the little things at least.” I wasn’t admitting it yet, but I was lying through my teeth.

I don’t know how that made her feel. I crossed a few sectors. Answered a few calls, made a handful of drop offs. Kinda dazed, in that ‘everything is the road’ kind of way outside of procedures. Even started humming a little tune to myself, and I think someone in the back hummed along, too.

Eventually, I was about halfway to. The road can be really long, or really short, depending. I’d been coming from the middle, abouts, so it was more the former. Sometimes I make a trip in less than a couple of minutes, as the roads kinda just shift as they please. Always people redirecting the paths, making new ones. Sometimes the walls move further away, new places pop up. Ebb and flow, like a river getting new tributaries.

I stopped, and I saw something I didn’t quite expect. Was a woman in full armor, from across the wall. Had a big old gun, a little one, and a whole backpack full of what must’ve been gadgets. They always had gadgets and gizmos, but they weren’t sentimental like mine. They had these clear helmets. They usually kinda roamed in packs, or were full solo. Jumpy when their pants were green, real friendly in a distant way otherwise.

This one was the former. She was waiting at the bus stop, which put me off. Usually they had their own vehicles. Usually kinda open-spaced ones, or ones you could just look at and know god himself would have to toss em’ about to crack em’. Some folks around here got interested in a way you don’t want, or got jumpy when you didn’t need them to be, if they couldn’t see inside your vehicle. My bus has windows I can roll down because of it. I keep em’ up during travel, but sometimes I gotta roll em’ down as a sort of peace sign.

Don’t want anyone to think I’m hiding anything. Though, this lady was looking at me like she thought that was the only possible option. Her armor was all green and black. The wall people, see, they use two kinds of colors: camo colors, or appeasing colors. Blue and yellow were, for whatever reason, the favorite of local folk. Green and black was good camo, and meant business.

I don’t usually have folk like her on board, but I ended up having that be the case today. She put something in the payment box. She knew my rules. No matter how green they were, they paid attention to things like that. They can be reassuring. They can pull you out of a lot of bad situations. She put an old coin I didn’t recognize the face of in the box. Sat down in the back after showing me everything.

They make me nervous, her sort, since it not only always feels like trouble is around the corner, especially if they need picked up, but because it can be hard to tell if they’re hiding their parts or not. Sometimes that stuff got real semantic, and I preferred directness. I got stuck on the bus for a brief bit, once, with one that turned out to not at all be a friendly sort beneath. Got pulled out by their… What’s it… Squad.

I ask her the questions, get real clipped responses. Other passenger gets nervous. I try not to let either get to me, since I need to want them to go where they need to get. They were headed the same way, so all should’ve gone real smooth. It was just me, her, and the yellow coat.

“So…” I looked in the rear view mirror at the river dweller. “Can I ask you something, again? Something about the river goings on, recently.” I was fishing for knowledge again. Seeing the wall suit kind of reinvigorated me. Even if they were perfectly innocent, which I was actively and successfully convincing myself they were, maybe they could say something that’d tell the wall suit something was off. I could maybe make a report myself. It was hard to tell if something was fully wrong, even if you didn’t like the answers sometimes, but they always knew what to do. Least, most of the time.

“...Sure. Okay.” The river woman was pretty blatantly eyeing the back of the head of the wall suit. Now, thing is, you don’t always need to do the routines with everyone. If the only person in the room you really care about making the judgement call, like a bus driver for example, passed someone, you can usually just let that be that. Sometimes you needed to be more thorough, though, or some folk really insisted. Or they got nervous if everyone didn’t do it.

“Did you uh… Did you see a fellow wearing the clothes you got, before you got them, pass by?” I had to think real hard to make sure I wasn’t prying. The world didn’t do anything to make me feel like it was listening, as I said the words, so I didn’t feel too put off by my wording choice. I did feel put off, though, by the inkling in the back of my head that the smooth going was telling me that something wrong really had gone down.

“Yes. They died.”

I almost stopped the bus right there. Almost. I saw the suiter go rigid, in the subtle way they go.

“They… Passed away. Huh.” I drummed my fingers on the wheel. I looked at her through the rear view. Saw her blurring, elongating. When I briefly glanced over my shoulder, it wasn’t happening, but it was in the mirror. I convinced myself that was some kind of… Tell. I couldn’t remember if I’d seen her sort do it before, what it meant. My head was getting fuzzy. So, ears stuffed with cotton, I pressed.

“How’d they pass away?” I gritted my teeth a little. I kept my eyes on the road. Though I’m pretty sure they were squirming, now. I heard the seat creak.

“Can’t say. I can’t pry. Not until I’m over the wall. Could I… Tell you past the gate?”

“I don’t go past the gate.” I was being stubborn, and I knew it. But I was getting agitated, afraid, frothing for a bit of justice. I get too attached to my passengers, sometimes. It doesn’t take much, when they’re my world.

She burbled something, but I couldn’t hear over the siren.

A cop car, old style. Least, pretty sure it was old style. I’ve seen a handful of the newer ones, in pictures or other places. Seen some on the road, even, or in the city-type locales. It rolled up, and kept pace easily, since my bus is a little faster than most, maybe, but it’s not a speed demon by any means.

It was the Policeman. I looked at my empty milk carton before I looked at the rear view. He didn’t look any better than he had last time I’d seen him. I’ll tell you honest, my eyes blurred a little. The road got a little less straight. I think I swerved, just slightly, and I probably would’ve felt it more if the bus weren’t so weighty and unwieldy. I took a second, hands off the wheel just a moment, to rub my glasses out. I wasn’t thinking straight, but the road was wide here, so nothing untoward happened.

When I was blinking my eyes clear, when I put the rag away and the fuzz cleared from my head, I realized he was driving right up to the side. He looked at me through sunglasses-covered peepers, though I know he didn’t have actual eyes, not anymore. He’d pass the tests, still, and he was a real stickler for rules.

He couldn’t abide anything else. I knew he couldn’t, so my hands got clammy. “Officer. Can I help you?” I didn’t stop. There’s no rule saying you have to out here, and I’d much rather hope I lose him somehow. He can follow all the roads too, though, secret and public. I don’t think I could have lost him, even if I hit the gas and used all my tricks like a madman.

Now, I don’t want to misrepresent the Policeman. I think he’s from the same… Same length of the road I am. I say think, I stress that bit, because I don’t know for sure. I don’t know if anything from my past is real except the pickups and dropoffs. But him, the Mailman, the Milkman, I think we’re connected somehow. I know, because when the Policeman does something wrong, it always hurts. Even if it’s in line with the rules.

“Unpaid passenger.” his voice sounded just like it would over the radio. He used to call me over it. Talk to me, especially when something was wrong. He was the perfect model officer. I think he always was. When I look out the window now, though, I don’t see much of him. He’s… Healthier than he should be. And some things don’t quite match up with how his uniform, his posture, his mannerisms are supposed to be. Not anymore.

He didn’t call me anymore, unless he wanted to correct something. I didn’t answer often, though sometimes I hoped it’d be him again. He used to be so warm. He used to let things go.

“Everyone on board is paid. I’m getting them where we need to go. Please, could you just pull off? Just this once?” My voice had been weak, croaky.

He didn’t answer. Just sent his siren wailing again.

“Okay, listen to me.” I wasn’t talking to him anymore. I was talking to my passengers. “I need you to make a trade with me, right now. I don’t care what it is, but promise something you can give that matters. I need extra tires.” I was starting to sound real silly, but it made a lot of sense in the moment. Not enough sense, though.

All I got from the back was a confused burble. It turned into an off-key scream as the bus started to rock. I saw the Policeman look me right in the eye as he slammed his vehicle into the side of mine. I knew exactly what came next. I either figured out some way to get around my own feelings, make something solid, or he’d run me off the road. Or worse. He had a lot of tools.

He shot at the window. Pulled a snub pistol out of nowhere, fired it without more than a glance at his own mirror. His car was covered in them, so he could see everything from every angle.

The shot hit almost right where the passenger wearing the yellow coat was. He missed, but he might not next time.

“Please. Give me something to work with. I… Shit.” I watched the suiter pull out her big gun. Load it up. She was surprisingly calm. She riddled the cop car with a lot of shots, but the Policeman has been around a while. When something’s been around a while, sometimes, it gets harder to shake off. Sometimes, you just can’t, and you’re gone the moment you’re in it’s sights.

I pulled over. Something occurred to me. I had rules, and I could get around this easily, at least in this situation. I tried to be smart.

I grabbed the passenger who was the object of the mad officer’s pursuit by the arm, and started pulling her off the bus. She was still soaking. I felt my shirt get drenched just with that little bit of contact. I was careful not to accidentally take something off her person that she might consider valuable, or do any harm, no tugs in the wrong place. Doing things to other people’s stuff could get you in a world of trouble if you wanted to be mindful of the important manners.

I dragged her off. A little too rough. She stumbled, hit her face on the road. I had a moment where I breathed real heavy, palms sweating and my forehead running like it was raining. Thought I’d hurt her, maybe broke a tooth.

I called out. “Listen, okay? She’s off. She can’t be unpaid if she’s not on. I didn’t drive her the whole way. It doesn’t count.” I think my voice was shaky, cracking.

The Policeman stopped his deadset drive. Pulled up slowly, got out of his vehicle. The suiter didn’t bother firing on him. It was way easier to just let something de-escalate, especially in a place like this where it was real important to let happen more often than not. The copper walked up to the river woman, looked her over almost like he was confused. Like there was a little bit of him left inside that was thinking ‘God, why am I out here acting like such a wild fool?’.

“Please, don’t hurt me.” She warbled out. I realized, then, how small she actually was. Around here, lots of nasty folk play pretend. Try to get you to lower your guard, so they can put you in positions where they could take everything you had and more. Her teeth were sharp. Her eyes weren’t like mine, glowing in the dark like flashlights. Her fingers were all webbed and awkward.

But she hadn’t done nothin’ to me. I’d only assumed. The little voice in the back of my head had let me forget my own gosh darn rules, and now here everyone was, all stressed for no reason.

I felt bad. I went up to her, went to put my hand on her shoulder gentle like. It would've been fine to get on the bus, then. I’d gotten my head straight. No one had hurt each other while everything was straightened out in the world’s eyes. I think my passenger, the one from the river, I think she thought I was cross with her, though. Didn’t know what was what anymore, so she panicked. She assumed.

She grabbed his gun. It slipped easy from his belt, since he wasn’t all that concerned with keeping it. He didn’t need it to dole out his justice. And he was, surely, confident he could take it back. She even fired one into him, right into his chest. I saw his old shirt run red, soak fast.

The Policeman cocked his head, like he was all thoughtful, and he took a step forward. He fixed his eyes on her, grabbed her with his iron grip. He told her she was under arrest, and that she’d violated something called the Formality. Shouted something about ‘undue harm to law abiders’ and ‘stolen property’. I had a brief moment where something clicked in my head, one of the little things I forgot that blurs in with the rest of my daily routines.

I stood there, helpless, as I watched him throw her into the back seat. I was a coward. My legs froze, got heavy, and my arms were rigid. I wondered, for a moment, where she’d learned to do something so stupid. Was she trying to imitate the people from across the wall? Maybe some… Fiction someone had exposed her to. Some of the people around here, especially the genuine ones, were real impressionable.

Or maybe she’d just been scared. That droning, half-drowned noise she made certainly gave that impression.

I know I told you I make it a rule not to wander off the road. Technically, it’s not always a bad thing. It’s not going off road that gets you in trouble. But it makes it a lot easier, and I’d be lying if I said I was brave. And I felt at home on the road. Felt like I belonged, like it was the only place I ever needed to be.

That wasn’t the case here, though. I needed to be somewhere real specific. I needed to fix a mistake. Dumbly, I walked forward a few feet, like I could walk or - God forbid my old bones - run them down. I remembered my bus, and I got in it. And I drove. I hit the pedal.

I couldn’t catch up. My other passenger just… Watched. I don’t think she was particularly leaning one way or the other on what happened. I imagine in some list somewhere there’s a big red X on the Policeman’s face. He’d broken rules before, and now that he didn’t, it made him dangerous. It’d be nice to cross him off, maybe, though despite the things he does it twists my guts to say it out loud.

I told her to shoot. Shouted at her as I watched the sirens disappear into the distance. Shouted louder. Begged her to pop his tires, maybe. Maybe she ignored me because she knew it would draw a lot of attention from things none of us wanted to come peeking in. Maybe it was because, technically, everything was in line, or maybe because it wasn’t clear. I’d seen her sort be heroes before, and I was, excuse my language, pissed she wasn’t being one right now.

But I’d seen her sort be heroes, in person, and I’d seen it go well and not go well. Especially if you stick your nose in things that were, on paper, in order.

The shouts - no, the screams, the crying - got quieter, and it wasn’t because of distance anymore. I don’t know what he was doing. But whatever it was, it was effective enough the ordeal only lasted a few more minutes.

When he crossed off the road, weaving through the wild and into some misplaced suburbs that weren’t quite suburbs, like it was his special little world he knew just perfect, I followed him for a few blocks. But I lost him, fast enough. He disappeared around a corner, and all I could hear was the sirens blaring off and into the beyond where I’d never find him.

I parked the bus. The wheels ground to a halt. My other passenger, the suiter, she didn’t say a word. I don’t think I had much right to cry, or slam the wheel like I did. But I did it. I was frustrated.

Eventually, I went off the bus, stumbled like I was drunk on the job. He’d tossed her things out his window, just off the road, and I found it all after a bit of wandering. There was this… Thing a lot of locals did. If they didn’t need something, it was good for trade to just let someone else have it, or people just didn’t care about discarding it. Sometimes, they’d return things, go out of their way all kind like. Or, hell, they’d use it as traps. Some of those things, you drive over them, break em’, bad things happen sometimes.

I didn’t know where the coat or the hat could possibly go. I wondered if, maybe, I’d seen a second body in the cop car. There was a little red ball on the ground, near the coat. I tried to put together some puzzle pieces in my head. The deer? Had they maybe taken it? Had someone gotten on the bus, or had the one passenger gotten off it, when I wasn’t looking?

But I stopped. I pried in the first place, and it got me a black mark on my record I couldn’t erase. The only question still on my mind is the string-up notes.

The deer were crowding around me, all curious. I looked around, realized I was in the same spot where things had gone cross yesterday. I laughed, a little snapping mad chuckle, then choked it down. I don’t know what they were thinking. Maybe they were sorry for whatever role they might’ve had in it, had come to apologize. Maybe they were just wandering, wondering if I was easy prey. Maybe they just wanted to find out what the noises were all about. Maybe they just wanted my hat.

They didn’t seem so scary anymore. You can do a lot worse than eat someone’s tires.

I went back onto the bus. Took some breaths, gathered myself. I had some bread, so I tossed a few to the deer. Like you do with ducks. Not sure it’s the same with deer, but I don’t think they follow the logic of other deer. I drove the suiter to the gate, as I was obliged to. Muttered something to the youngster at the booth about the deer and the Policeman, asked if I needed to write some sort of report.

When I hunkered down for the night, I wrote my rules down on paper, and put them on the glove box with some tape. So I won't forget.

I thought about it for a bit, then attached a return clip, whatever you’d call it, asking who was addressing me to the one that said “I’m sorry I killed them”. Didn’t know if I’d get a response, if it was even okay to ask. I’d wanted to know, and I’d been leaning into the idea it was coming from somewhere over the wall, or it being anonymous, meant nothing could go poorly off it.

The response was straightforward. Faster than expected. Maybe I should’ve done it earlier, but I’d skipped that one. Wasn’t sure what would happen if I replied, or if I’d even get any. “I took their place”, it read.

I think you can’t just let your imagination go wild when it comes to other people. Even in a place like this, even if you’ve got decent reasons to think something might be happening that shouldn’t be. If there’s a chance you’re just going to do more harm than good assuming, especially if it can wait, if you can let someone who knows what’s what handle it, you should.

I want to say I’m getting old, so I’m making mistakes again. But I’ll be honest. I’ve only started making less. I don’t care what you look like, where you’re from. As long as you want to go somewhere, and you deserve to get there - hell, even if you don’t, people can get better - I’ll take you there. I won’t pretend this’ll be my last screw up, but I think when I screw up, it needs to be because I tried, not because I didn’t.

I think I’ll start driving to the Mailman’s place tomorrow. Ask some questions. I think, if I had a place to turn my badge in, so to speak, I’d do it. But I don’t.

I still have to drive the bus. Nobody is lining up to take my place, so I still have to drive the bus.

Was that a flash? I think… I think I just heard a click. If it wasn’t him, or her...

I have to stop here. I’ll try to get back, if anyone’s listening. I might need help. I don’t know if I have the right to ask for it, but I think I just saw something… Something I didn’t like.
