15 years ago, i awoke one morning to find my daughter had gone missing. She was only 16, and wasn’t lying in her bed when I woke up. 

I called the police and searched for her. After all, thats what a good mother would do, right? 

I couldn’t find her anywhere, I searched the house, the forest, her favourite places to go. But nothing. After all those years, nobody found even a trace of her. 

That was until one evening, i got a call from an unknown number. I picked up the phone, sat on the couch with my husband. He had his arm around me, as I picked up the phone. There was a moment of silence.

“Hello? who is this, and what do you want?” I said, almost choking on my words. What if this person knew our secret? I was scared. I felt like I couldn’t breathe, like my lungs were closing in on me. 

I hoped this was a prank call. My stomach dropped as I heard this person’s voice. It was my daughter. 15 years later.

“Hello, mother. Is father with you? I cant believe I found your number after all of these years.” 

My mouth fell open instantly. This cant be. You see, usually a mother would feel happy hearing from their “missing” daughter, but not when I was the one who killed her and hid her body. Hearing her voice 15 years later, definitely came to a surprise. I’m shocked. I dont know what to feel. My husband helped me. She was never a good girl. I wanted her gone, and i thought she was, until now. 

“I know it was you. I know what you did to me. How could you?” 

“I’m sorry babygirl. I just wanted you gone. You were so horrible to me and i couldn’t take it anymore.” 

I started to cry. This was the daughter i had stabbed repeatedly, until she was no longer conscious, and even then, i carried on. How was she contacting me? 

“I’ll get you mum, don’t worry. Youll get your karma.” 

She hung up, as i started to panic. My heart racing. I dont know if that was really my daughter or not, but i guess we will find out if she comes for me. 
Until then, im hid in my underground bunker that we had built years ago due to war threats in my country. I wonder if she will actually come for me or not, I guess i’ll find out soon. 

This was it. As i sat in the bunker, crying, i could hear her. I could hear arabella, shouting. 

“Mother, where are you?” 

How was she here? Im scared. I can’t breathe. Im choking. She was outside. As she shouts my name, I start to question how she could even be alive. I made sure she was dead, I buried her in the back of the park. Even if she survived my stabbing, how did she even manage to survive the burial?

“Elena, i’m going to find you.” 

I just wanted to scream, i couldn’t breathe. Everything was tight. I was panicking.
Suddenly, her shouting came to a stop, and I heard her stop moving around. Tears uncontrollably flowed from my eyes as i held my hand over my mouth as tightly as i could. And thats when i heard it. I heard her starting to move the door to the bunker. 

“I’m here, mother” she yelled walking down the stairs to where I was, laughing. 

As she got down the stairs, she looked me in the eyes. She had a knife in her hand, and she was standing there, blankly staring at me.

She looked exactly as i remembered. Long blond hair, one green eye and the other blue. Her eyes were always so beautiful, they were pure. She had mud covering her, and she was soaked in dry blood. 

“Hello, arabella.” I choked on my words, trying to find my voice from the panicking and the crying. 

“Hello, mother. I’ve come to say sorry.” She mumbled under her breath.

She put her arms out for a hug, and i came over to hug her, accepting her apology.
But then, I felt it. 
The knife impaled my arm. She grabbed me by my hair, and I looked up at her, tears flooding my eyes. 

“Why, arabella?” I cried, looking into her eyes.

“This is what you deserve mum. I can’t believe you could try and hurt me and expect nothing back.” she laughed, still
holding onto my hair. 

As i looked into her eyes, with tears flowing down my cheek, she stabbed me. right in the chest. 

“I’m sorry, arabella.” I managed to mutter, before taking one of my last breaths. 

She carried on stabbing me over and over again. 
I finally feel how she must’ve felt when i did this to her.
