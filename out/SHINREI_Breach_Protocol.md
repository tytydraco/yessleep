The 20th and 21st centuries brought an amazing pace of progress. That progress was brought on top of mountains of bodies, and corpses. Rivers and oceans of blood flowed, there had been enough, but they still overflow to this day.

Among all the progress that has been made, there is a certain sector of advancement that should've remained unknown indefinitely. 

Genetic engineering.

The genome is something if cracked and tampered with by someone or something that simply doesn't understand it in its entirety can be... Destructive.

You have heard the saying that if you stare into the abyss long enough, the abyss will stare back. There are many interpretations of that saying, told by Nietsche long ago. But there is only one true answer to that question, the question of what exactly stares back.

Sometime in the early 1940s, the Japanese managed through the human trials of the so-called "Shinrei jikken*心霊実験*". In literal translation it means "Psychic Experiments", and that was exactly that.

After hundreds of trials, hundreds of dead unwilling participants. The Japanese scientists managed to do something the Germans could only dream of. And what the Americans try to replicate to this very day.

A true over-man.

Ubermenschen.

A Japanese prisoner, a deserter. they thought it would kill him but no, he was special. He managed to survive the experiment. he was the first specimen who had his powers "awoken". 

There is little information on the man, some say he was killed because of the danger he presented despite his military potential. He could've single-handedly won the war for Japan.

Some say he escaped somewhere far away. 

Some say he was not the only one the Japs managed to create.

...

In the twentieth century, not so long ago. We managed to crack the human genome and had been mapping it ever since. Of course, public information is limited, severely limited. We know more about the human genome than the public is led to believe. But of course, we still know nothing, in the grand scheme of things.

With our ever-expanding knowledge of genetics, we managed to find the gene responsible for the latent abilities that a select few may possess. Even if you rounded up a thousand of those compatible only a single person would survive the "transformation"... The awakening.

There were legends of Gods in every single culture on Earth, and those Gods were always human in one way or another. Sometimes with animal characteristics. We are led to believe that "Shinrei" as they have now been dubbed have been around for a lot longer than previously thought.

The Shinrei has become more and more abundant as time went on. The reasons for that are unknown. What we do know is that every year there are more and more incidents where people who have the correct genetics spontaneously awaken their abilities. Their abilities though powerful are limited.

They can do damage yes, the last capture left 15 men dead. A little girl in South Africa had her abilities awake after someone... forced himself upon her.

The man was found shredded, completely and utterly mangled into a heap of meat and bone. His skull had been eviscerated to dust.

After finding the girl we attempted to capture her but she- **SHE STRUGGLED S̵̲̼̣̤͑͑H̸͙̼̯͆̈́͐̉́̓̀͝É̸̢̝̜͠ ̴̛͔̣̔̈́̀̚͝Ả̴͉͌̒̅͒̓̈́͝Ș̷͖͔̂͒̋̌͐̿ͅC̴̨̓͒̒͝Ë̶̠͕Ṇ̴̫̪̯͇͗̈̓̈́̎̃D̵̛̮̟̙̰̓͛͋̀̌̚E̷̡̤̦̼̬̪̖̕͠D̷͚̬̖̀̃̓͝͝**

**\*static\***

\-leaving fifteen men dead. After the unfortunate incident, multiple governments invested more money and tools in order to contain the threat that the Shinrei now presented.

Special task forces had been assembled to contain them. New tactics had been developed to combat them. 

But no matter how much money we threw at it we couldn't contain it completely. We could only minimize the damage at best... The Paris incident nearly revealed their existence to the wider world... Nearly.

I always imagined it a nightmare if the world found out but I am now left without a choice. That is why I am recording this message. I feel obligated to let the world know what we have found out recently.

Three months ago there was another incident in the favelas of Rio, Brazil. Left approximately 58 people dead. The Shinrei was terminated on-site. A day later another incident which exhibited a nearly identical way of using mental mel- **Ś̷͈̝̺̘͓̅L̶͕͕̼͆͛̂͋ͅẠ̸̈́̓͝Ų̶̤̘̾̇Ģ̷͙̝̞̇͋̑͛Ḣ̷̹̣̱̫T̴̜̣̐̐̄͜͝E̵̜̲̘͋̂̆̾R̸̙̗͇͉͇̒̐ HOMINI NON REX REGIS Ű̷̖̪̅N̶̗̩̎̀͝Ǐ̵̧̧̛͑V̶̻̱̔̆E̵̪̔͛̕R̷̰̜̗̀̓S̷̨̱̹͌**

\-another, around 56 incidents globally within a week. Which was triple the record. We didn't have enough resources, and we still do not have enough resources. It is only a matter of time before the wider world becomes aware of this threat. The Shinrei is on the rise and there is nothing we can do to stop it. We are still trying to find ways of combating it, experimental technology using EMS, or Electro-Magnetic-Shield has promising results. But it is still in its early stages of development and we cannot produce it on a mass scale as of yet.

There are further concerns about the latest incident that was reported via satellite near the Antarctic circle. There are whispers that the old theory that the first Shinrei escaped, is in fact, true. Though this is only conjecture.

Although as time passes I too am slowly becoming a believer in that theory. Because- **I WAS GONE BUT NOW I HAVE R̵͉̥̹̅Ȉ̴̠̹̿̊S̶̩̓̽͂É̸̺̀Ň̸̮̳͓̆̑ R̵͉̥̹̅Ȉ̴̠̹̿̊S̶̩̓̽͂É̸̺̀Ň̸̮̳͓̆̑ R̵͉̥̹̅Ȉ̴̠̹̿̊S̶̩̓̽͂É̸̺̀Ň̸̮̳͓̆̑ R̵͉̥̹̅Ȉ̴̠̹̿̊S̶̩̓̽͂É̸̺̀Ň̸̮̳͓̆̑**

... I am rambling, I'm sorry... We have had... Problems with communications. I...

I will get to the point. There is a certain... thing, that had been proposed. That the original Shinrei was alive, he is still alive. And as we have observed multiple Shinrei use mental and psy- **static** ... 

\- If we go by that theory, which thus far has plenty of evidence... And there is still more coming... We come to the inevitable conclusion that the Shinrei are all connected, in some sort of web... A hive... hivemind...
