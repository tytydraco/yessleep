I was that kid in the back of the room, the one that was quiet, hated cameras, always there but never really seen. I preferred it that way, until I met “Xavier”, I won’t use his real name but saying “My friend” or something similar is unusual to me.



Xavier and I weren’t fast friends, we were instant friends. I was sat in our school library, reading through, I think it was Turning of The Screw that day, and he saw me and next thing I knew, I had a reading buddy. He didn’t like my taste in books much, and I didn’t like his, but we still suggested books to each other. I’ve found a love for a few new books and series thanks to him, he still doesn’t like my psychological horrors and thrillers, but he has tried to read a few.



Anyway, I’m rambling. My apologies, I’m sleep deprived. I haven’t really slept since this whole thing, and I remembered a little while ago my therapist telling me that writing things down and telling people might help. So I’m here. I hope this helps.



Now, Xavier and I had decided to end our school days with a camping trip. I’ve just finished school and he dropped out a year or so ago. But we decided to grab clothes and visit this volcano an hour or so from my house, it was a popular tourist location until a few years ago and a family went missing. Ghost stories aplenty appeared after that, its the culture here, agree and add details when someone not from around here tells you they heard something from someone or other.



But, we’d decided to go, it would be empty and quiet. We were nearing winter and it got cold hear, though there was never any snow. By the time we got to the camp ground I was starting to feel that dizzy lightheaded feeling I got when something finally settled in. There were no lights, we appeared to be completely alone. And it was a running joke, but I’m terrified of the dark and the silence.



We’d set everything up and I needed to walk, my leg ached from the walking brace was digging in. I remember standing at the edge of the clearing, and just looking up, not straight up, but from where I was standing it felt like I was looking straight ahead, an illusion from the way the trees grew compared to the ground. It made me feel dizzy and a wave of vertigo nearly knocking me over and I decided to take a picture and not do that again.



I remember how quiet it felt, it was too quiet. Like there was nothing around, and maybe some people found that peaceful. I didn’t, I hated when nothing was making noise, I needed noise, not white noise but people, songs, something synthetic. It made me feel safe, I hadn’t thought to grab a speaker in our haste.



“C’mon on, mate, quit fretting.”



I remember muttering something obscene at him, though I doubt he heard what, and I don’t remember, I never had the best memory.



“Rude,” he’d laughed, a stone hitting my hand. “We have a bucket of water to put the fire out, just sit down and relax,” he grabbed me and practically forcing me into the camp chair. It’s not that I didn’t believe him, I just struggle to just stop and exist. And when I found a stick shoved in my hands and a pack of Jumbo marshmallows on my lap I scoffed, roasting one over the open fire.



I don’t remember much of that night, or the following day. I just remember a couple of cops driving down. They said something about just checking in because the smoke had been spotted earlier, and a warning about being careful not to wander too far so we didn’t get lost. They were nice, I think I remember that. But everything is fuzzy and kind of hazy.



By the second night, I’d gotten over the immediate nerves of being in the dark and the night silence so I was less restless. We were laughing and joking, telling scary stories that got my skin crawling. It’s kind of ironic that *I* was the one that got scared by ghost stories and yet I loved them, Xavier got scared too, but he didn’t enjoy horror like I did.



But the fire was nice, the food was unhealthy and I felt at peace with Xavier. We were in the tent, a fabric one from my reenactment days, we ended up in the same sleeping bag as the chill came in. This is the only part I remember perfectly clearly of the whole trip.



That night I kept waking up, the first time was just before midnight. I only knew that from the alarm clock radio Xavier had allowed me to bring, it wasn't that good of an alarm clock, or a radio. But, and the only reason he allowed me to bring it on our technology free trip, it told the temperature as well as the date and time. The main reason I wanted it was because it produced a good amount of light and I wasn't stuck in complete darkness with a breathing person.



By the tenth time I woke up without really knowing why, I decided it had to be because I needed to pee. It wasn't uncommon to keep waking up when I had to go. So I carefully pushed Xavier off of me, much to his dream addled annoyance if the way he protested slightly.



Sat there in the tent fighting with the closing strap, I remembered the pain that was dealing with the weird loop system the Vikings the tent had been based on used. Top strap went through the top loop on the body of the tent, then threaded into the next one before the strap was looped through them both and all the way down.



By the time I'd gotten the bottom five undone the need to pee had taken root. I slipped out of the decently lit confines and as I sat there looking at the dark clearing I felt that dread pooling in my stomach at the thought of being out in the dark. It was irrational, but for a moment I contemplated waking Xavier and begging him to come with me.



But I forced the feeling down, my inability to deal with my fear of the dark wasn't an excuse to wake Xavier. So I grabbed the stick we'd been using to roast marshmallows and used it to pull myself up right. In that moment, as I shuffled across the camp site to the tree line I remembered how much I took having too fully functional legs to walk.



I had to keep my head down so I could make sure I didn't step funny on the ground. The only thing worse than shuffling through a dark space on one leg and a stick, was tripping and screwing my other leg up and being stranded there.



For a moment I wondered what I would do, if I would just stay still and panic? Or would I instinctively try to get back the tent? Or, more likely, I would just have a complete panic attack and freak our until Xavier came out to calm me.



I had reached the tree line by the time I had focused back on my task. I didn't trust my leg to stay stable while I urinated if I looked up at the dizzying trees. Then I heard the rustle of the tent flap as it was forced open.



I nearly called out to greet Xavier, but the fear that there was something out there that would hear me kept the words caught in my throat. Though, after a long moment with no sound of footsteps in the dead leaves I came to the conclusion that Xavier had awoken and noticed I was gone and poked his head out to check on me. And I felt safer.



As I finished, I had moved the stick and turned. A flicker of confusion burst in my chest at the large shadow in the tent. But it had to be Xavier moving around, I reasoned. It made sense as I shuffled closer, until I noticed the mass that would have to be on the air mattress.



A body shaped shadow, and I remember the sheer terror in my chest as I screamed, realising there was someone in there with Xavier. Whoever it was seemed to startle and knocked the clock over and I lost sight of the shadows.



I managed to round the tent and yanked it open, ready to use the stick to attack the person when Xavier rightened the light and and I saw he was the only one in there and spun, half expecting to see the person behind me. But all I saw was the smouldering embers of the coals in the fire-pit disappear and reappear.



Xavier had gently grabbed my arm, murmuring something that was probably supposed to be comforting or maybe coaxing. But over the roar of adrenaline and my racing heartbeat he might as well have been signing at me.



I stood there, just watching the clearing for a long few moments before Xavier managed to coax me into the tent. He gently forced me to the mattress as he grabbed a torch and looked around outside before redoing the straps, repeatedly asking me what was wrong. The flap was firmly closed before he turned to face me properly, asking me again what happened. But the words caught in my throat as I fought down the gasping breaths.



I didn't sleep the rest of the night, every little noise caused me to flinch and fear rush through my body. My hand stayed clenched around Xavier's all night as I sat vigilante. When I had managed to stammer an explanation out Xavier had tried to reassure me it was just paranoia. But there's something about that sort of terror that made you know there was something to be terrified of.



The next day I had been more quiet, unable to stop watching the trees. Xavier had started whistling or humming. “To fill the void,” he’d explained when I asked why. I started doing it too, it was a balm to my frayed nerves.



We’d gone on a walk, ate lunch and just lay around the fire talking about nothing and everything. But as the night started crawling across the sky the lump in my stomach appeared and I felt that growing dread. We stayed up later that night, I don’t think Xavier was all the comfortable with me after the night before.



It was early morning by the time he decided that we should get some sleep. We curled up and I was struggling to sleep, still unnerved out of my skin. But I had managed to. The clock had read about 4:19 the last time I’d checked it before I fell asleep.



At least Xavier agreed that something was wrong that morning.



Now, I’ve never been a sleep walker, maybe a bit of a chatter box, but I never got up and wandered around. Not without someone coaxing me about. And after my leg, I was most definitely not going to get up and walk around while I was asleep.



Xavier woke me that morning, and the sun was high. It was strange for me to sleep so late, but then again, just over twenty-four hours awake would take their toll. It was only after I reasoned that I became of the one problem with the light sky.



I wasn’t in the tent.



“Don’t!”



I had never heard that tone from Xavier before, and it was then that I came to the sinking realisation that he wasn’t as loud as he should have been. But there was bark digging in my shoulder, and as the pins and needles spread up my leg, I looked down.



I don’t like heights. It’s not that I’m afraid of them, I’m afraid of not having something solid under my feet.



And as I looked down, and saw Xavier beneath me, the ground so far. I let out the most pathetic of noises. It took half an hour before I was able to calm myself enough to look around without wanting to vomit. I was perched on a stable and large branch a good ten-fifteen metres off the ground, so a small part of me felt better knowing that I was only going to fall if I moved.



But my leg was cramping as it dangled beneath me, and I knew that if I left it like that I could screw up the circulation. But I had no idea where my centre of balance was, I had no idea how far I could lean or shift without risking falling down. I had decided to just pull and hold my leg up so it was still over the edge of the branch as to not change my balance all that much.



Xavier had spent the time trying to not only figure out how I got up there, but how I was supposed to get down. Apparently he couldn’t see how I climbed up, there were no other branches, I was sat on the second lowest, with the next on the other side of the tree not that far beneath me, but it was also a hollow, dead branch that would have shattered under my weight if I had used it. Xavier had found that out when he’d tried to make a makeshift ladder with it, the rope tied securely and the moment he tried to pull himself up it creaked before slamming into the ground.



I would be lying if that hadn’t got my heart racing again. I just kept wondering how long before the branch I was on broke. Even with Xavier laughing it off and telling me it was hollow and long dead and I was sat on a healthy branch, I couldn’t fight the panic. But I had managed to catch the rope as Xavier decided to throw it towards me instead.



I had managed to tie it there, but no knot would ever be strong enough for me to trust my weight on. Even with the much lighter frame I had for my height and age. But Xavier had started to climb up and was about half way up and there was no creaking. But he’d gone back down to stretch his hands and rub some of the dirt into his palms for extra grip.



Have you ever dislocated your shoulder? It’s a searing pain, it feels like you’re about to rip your arm off. Especially when you’re holding onto a rope swinging around. I don’t remember falling, I don’t even remember grabbing the rope to stop my plummet to the ground. I just remember the searing pain in my shoulder as I latched onto and was swinging under it. I remember the pain of the rope ripping my skin as I fell to the ground. Xavier had grabbed my legs to stop me falling harshly on them.



Xavier had helped me clean my hands, neither of us talking about the tree. I still don’t know what happened to put me up there. And I don’t think I want to. We had debated using the pager the two police had left with us so we could contact them, asking them to come pick us up or bring a something for my hands and shoulder. But after a search we could remember where we placed it so we didn’t.



It had been relocated, I think I remember sobbing and begging then just not feeling anything until my throat burned with acid. I don’t think I did it, Xavier might have. But I can’t ask him at the moment. There’s a lot I don’t know, a lot I want to ask him. Unfortunately, at the moment, Xavier is unable to answer them. No one can. But that’s not important at the moment.



I remember being curled up at Xavier’s feet, like a dog most people said when they saw me do it. His hand was in my hair as we both just stayed silent, watching the crackling fire. We cooked, Kangaroo, I believe, I just remember struggling to chew it. Both because my jaw felt like it was glued, and my throat burned and my stomach refused to settle.



Xavier had practically forced a diced tomato into me, murmuring about how I had to eat something or I would make myself sicker.



That night neither of use were able to sleep, my body burned, and Xavier seemed scared that I would wander off again. I had tried to talk about some of the things I had learned in my classes, but after a few tries, we kept returning to the last November and the conversation stilted uncomfortably.



Had we fallen asleep, we would have missed the faint noise of dry leaves shifting around. Footsteps that seemed to echo louder, circling the tent. Xavier had glanced at the clock that left everything inside faintly visible. I had understood his silent question. And despite my nerves, the terror that gripped me at the thought of not knowing what was there I went to grab the clock before deciding that I would just knock the crate over and make sure it landed face down.



We were in darkness, and I forced my breathing to stay slow as the foot steps seemed to stay closer. I pictured the tent being pressed on as if someone was running their hand along it. Xavier hadn’t been drowned in terror and had grabbed the stick that I’d been using as a make shift walking stick when we weren’t roasting marshmallows, and he’d carefully undid one side of the flap.



I wanted to stop him, but I remained frozen. Eyes locked to the small black gap. I could still see the coals, and the moon was full so it wasn’t that dark. But as the foot steps rounded the corner, I waited and watched. For a moment I thought of a person appearing. But no one did. It was as if they vanished the moment they got to the gap.



But I could still hear them, could hear their breaths as they should have stood just outside the gap. Xavier seemed to have the same thought as he suddenly stabbed the stick out. There was no noise, no nothing, it just went through empty space.



I might not have the best memory, but I know, that for a second it seemed to get caught before it kept going. It looked as if something had been hit but vanished immediately afterwards and the stick kept going.



He pulled it back in and after a second he grabbed the clock and pointed it out. I never really understood why Xavier had always gotten frustrated when he came over and stayed the night in my room, complaining about my alarm clock. But seeing it’s pathetically small face light up all of the clearing in it’s path, I realised just how bright it was.



There was nothing and as Xavier stepped out, I had pressed a knife into his hand, the largest one I could find that wasn’t the butchers knife I had brought for preparing meat, that one I kept hold of as I took the stick and pulled myself to my feet to follow Xavier. We looked around, nothing seemed out of place.



But my leg felt awkward so I’d looked down and tried to make sure it was twisted or twisted funny, it had fallen numb so it wouldn’t have been strange to see that I had accidentally stood on the outside of my foot instead of the bottom. But it wasn’t my foot that caught my attention, it wasn’t the weird ache that made my hand clench on Xavier’s elbow.



I had stepped on an uneven spot in the ground, half of my foot on the flat ground and the other in the dip. But it wasn’t a dip, or a rock. We’d chosen this spot because there was perfectly flat ground leading to the fire. And as Xavier tilted the clock down, we became aware that it was a foot print. Deep, large foot prints that seemed to circle our tent and vanish.



Xavier had grabbed me and dragged me back into the tent. It jarred my leg.



The next thing I remember was Xavier forcing water down my throat, he’d pushed our ice cooler in front of the entrance flap and the clock was pointed was carefully suspended above us.



“It means we cane see without giving our locations away,” Xavier explained at, I’m sure, my confused look. “Just drink, you passed out. I’m not sure if it was shock or your leg. But you need to drink,” Xavier continued, helping me sit up.



That night was a rush of silent and careful packing. Xavier agreed that we wouldn’t be staying the rest of this planned trip. We had waited for the sun to properly rise before I focused on drenching the coals from our fire and cleaning up all our cooking stuff. We’d been good about using our rubbish box, so that wasn’t a problem.



But as I found myself studying the prints in the ground they seemed to be wrong. They were too long for feet, too thin for a person that had to be either really tall or had unusually big feet. There were some weird points on them too, points that seemed familiar and yet I couldn’t place them.



It wasn’t even noon before we were driving out, the trees following our assent up the large hill that used to hold the lava in when the place was an active volcano, which it hadn’t been for hundreds of years. But as we rose higher and higher, then down the other side, other than the motion sickness that hit me like a wave it seemed like everything was starting to freeze, as if while in the mouth we had felt the heat of lava.



I remember grabbing a blanket and wrapping it around my shoulders, Xavier had said it was probably just the motion sickness. But I… my fingers had been blue, or at least, they looked like they had tinged blue. But by the time I had managed to stutter out a plea for Xavier to look through chattering teeth, they had gone back to normal. They ached when I flexed them, but they were fine. I didn’t feel fine.



Xavier handed me a hot pocket, told me to just hold onto it. “You’re hands are scraped raw, it’s probably just that,” Xavier had said, though there was something about the way his voice shifted that told me he didn’t completely believe his own words.



Once we’d gotten a good bit away from the camp ground we pulled over and tried to come up with a plan. I couldn’t focus on anything but that ache in my body.



“I could go for some chocolate… a hot chocolate,” I said pathetically, I wasn’t even sure why. But I did remember that there was this place near by that made some of the best chocolate and hot chocolates I had ever had.



“They’ll probably have cell service too,” Xavier agreed, but he didn’t immediately begin to drive again. Instead he was watching me. And when I glanced at him he glanced down at my leg. It took a second before remembering the brace I was still wearing, and after a short fight with it we began driving.



I don’t remember the drive, or ordering my hot chocolate. I just remember sitting at one of the benches at the tables placed around the eating area. I didn’t really drink my hot chocolate, I just held the warm cup and let it sooth my hands as Xavier ignored his own drink to frantically search for something online.



Then we were on the road again, going somewhere I couldn’t remember being the name of, if I had even been told or decided together. I just watched the trees pass as we drove, flexing my legs and hands as I focused on keeping true feeling in them.



But as we drove, the sun dipping beneath the horizon, the dread of night started coming back. And as the Ute started going faster, hitting the speed limit than surely passing it, I knew Xavier was just as uncomfortable. I had started looking for hotels or motels near us. But in the middle of nowhere, with only the occasional building of the vast tiny town we drove through, there was nowhere.



“Just keep driving, I’ll take a nap, and we’ll swap,” I had suggested, and Xavier didn’t argue. It was all the more obvious Xavier was uncomfortable with the thought of stopping.



I’m not sure when Xavier had started shoving me until I woke up, I had prepared to swap with him, only to notice the sun starting to rise as the sky turned a deep orange. I was surprised, and maybe a little annoyed that Xavier had forced himself to drive through the night. It was dangerous, and idiotic, and I had told him so. But we swapped places and he was out quickly in the passenger seat.



I’m not a bad driver, but I’m cautious and scared. And I hate driving, hate being responsible for a nearly two and a half ton chunk of pure metal. I also constantly drifted left and right, I could never be too close to the lines. The outer ones gave me the uncontrollable thought that I was going to be jolted to the side and off the road, the inner lines had a similar effect, but there was something infinity more terrifying about swerving into another car.



But I kept focusing on the breathing exercises my therapist gave me and just kept driving. After a few long moments I had the sudden realisation, I was driving and my therapist tell me that I had finally faced my problem with cars. When Xavier woke and saw how far I had gotten us, he’d be proud. Or maybe it would be more about how long I could keep driving. In either case, I kept driving, the thought of Xavier waking and seeing how well I’d done fuelled me.



But the longer I sat there, driving, the more numb my leg became, my hands ached from clenching on the wheel. It wasn’t a panic attack. Not quite. But it was close. Or maybe it was because, as my leg grew numb, I stopped being able to properly tell how hard I was pressing the accelerator, pressing harder and harder so I could feel the pressure.



Xavier woke with a start, blinking in surprise as he asked what was wrong. “Mate! Why are we going so fast?” he’d demanded, grabbing his handle.



I ended up slamming on the breaks, the Ute lurched forward and I sucked in a deep breath. “Sorry…” I choked out. “I…”



Xavier had looked at me, a look of pity on his face before he sighed. “It’s ok. It’s been, what,” he’d looked out the window at the sky. “At least a good few hours, you did really well, mate,” he’d told me and we’d swapped back.



It was a few hours later when I came to the realisation that it seemed to be unusually empty. We were still surround by bush, but after a the hours we’d driven, you’d have expected us to have gotten to some sort of town or city.



“Xavier? Did you drive through any towns?” I’d asked, feeling something unnameable clawing at my stomach.



“No?”



“I didn’t,” I had whispered, suddenly unable to think of anything else to say. “We were only what? Two, maybe three hours out of \[Generic City Name\]. We’ve both driven a lot more than that,” I added.



I heard Xavier’s knuckles crack. “We-… we’re not-” He had started, but he didn’t get to finish the sentence. There was a screech, and I think we hit something big, I just remember the shadow towering over us as we came to the harsh stop. But my head had slammed forward into my airbag.



I’m not sure what happened, I feel like I’m writing that a lot. But admitting to not knowing is supposedly meant to help process. But, anyway. I have these small snippets, a burn, an ache, then blessed cold. The stench of something wet then just earth.



Then all I could smell was smoke and I jolted up. I gasped and looked around watching the flames eat up the leaves on the ground and I re-actively slammed my hand over it, smothering the flames. I pushed myself up, looking around the space.



Cold dread filled me as I recognised the camping ground. I looked around and found Xavier not that far from me, his nose appeared to be broken but he was breathing. I don’t remember how I got beside him, or when he woke up. But he winced and grabbed his eye and when he opened it I had forced him to close it. There was glass in is eye and I didn’t want him to blind himself. I tore my pant leg and wrapped it around his eye to try and keep it all stable.



I remember looking around, noting faintly the amount of feathers everywhere and the strange footsteps again. After a long moment I grabbed Xavier and helped him to his feet and we stumbled along. I vaguely remembered the road out of the grounds, pulling Xavier along it.



But as the night closed in, the fog rolled in, and as we neared the top of the hill, it grew so thick I couldn’t see my feet, I could barely see Xavier beside me, but I kept a tight grip on him as we moved. It was only after we reached the ridge that I remembered my mothers warning about making sure that if someone had a bleeding head wound, not to move them, keep them sat or laying down. But it was too late for that.



As we stumbled along, my foot hit something and I froze, it skirted away. But it was metallic, and I carefully felt for it and used my foot to pull it back. As my hands curled around it I froze, the button formatting, the tiny screen. “The pager thing, the police gave us,” I murmured, bringing it to my face.



I fumbled with it, Xavier was the one told how to use. I had been hiding away from them, a mix of social anxiety and a hatred for the way I looked left me uncomfortable, especially with people. But I managed to hit some combination of buttons that turned it on.



I struggled to write out help, trying to get my head around using a keypad to make words. I had managed to get it, after nearly six tries and multiple mistypes. But after I had done it, I had that feeling that we’d stopped to long, and needed to keep moving.



The thing about the outback, there were birds and insects and and other creatures day and night. I tuned them out constantly, they were a distraction to what might be sneaking around. But as I stumbled along, the call of birds was deafening loud, like they had lost something and wanted it back. It sounded like it was behind us, coming from the deep hole of the volcano and out.



Wings flapped and I felt a a wave of horror. People always said, while in nature, if everything went silence there was danger. If all the birds suddenly fled, taking flight, there was something big and dangerous coming. I tried to pull Xavier along, I was sure that whatever had circled our tent was what had scared them off, but he refused.



I saw weird dark shapes above us, they seemed to come down, circle closer. And I watched Xavier look up to, and he clung to me, legs buckling and I found myself struggling to hold all his weight up. Then red and blue flashes pierced the air, a screech of sirens and the shapes fled with what could have been terrified squawks.



I didn’t even think to move away from the middle of the road, and as headlights filled my vision I couldn’t move. A deer in headlights, I thought. A freeze response from heightened anxiety and finding myself in front of a car again, my therapist had called it.



I remember the screech of wheels, but maybe there weren’t any. I remember someone blocking out the light and then grabbing my arm before looking down at Xavier slumped against me.



“Come on, Mate, let’s get you in the car,” a woman’s voice said and I felt a hand on my back. I didn’t move, I didn’t want to let Xavier go, but the other officer picked him up and as he went to carry him away I tried to follow, my hands trying to stay attached but my leg gave out. “Hey, it’s ok, you’ll be with him,” the woman said as she helped my up and to the car. I didn’t pay attention to getting into the car, I just kept checking that Xavier wasn’t hurt.



“We need to go,” one of them had said, but I couldn’t focus on the words.

Xavier was looking past me, hand clenched around my own. And as I turned my head I say the faint outline of a tree, for a moment I didn’t understand. Then the rope tied to it’s lowest branch and a weird sharp protrusion on the other side of the trunk. Then my eyes landed on the dark shape that seemed to be crouched on the branch just above where I had woken up a couple days ago.



By the time we’d gotten to the nearest hospital Xavier was slurring and murmuring under his breath, something intelligible and drawled into one long sound. My body was on fire, pain shooting through every part of me. A magpie was sat in a tree above us as the police officers helped us in.



And for some reason I thought back to the wrong footprints. The three weird points. Then I remembered how they sharpened into a point at the back. And it clicked, they looked familiar because I had seen them. They were talon prints. Giant talons.



I remember freezing on the spot, eyes locked on that magpie as it called out it’s song. And I was stood back in the fog, listening to the angry birds, and Xavier was frozen beside me. I knew he had realised before I had. He hadn’t been afraid of the thing hearing us if we moved, he was afraid the giant birds would have seen us move. The thing in the tree.



I was in a medically induced coma for a couple days, it was for my health. When I woke up I was passed to different psychologists. Until one had asked about a memory, he’d asked why I didn’t shut my eyes to remember better when I told him I couldn’t remember. And I remember his face fell as I explained that that sort of thing never helped.



I was rushed into a lot more tests, and afterwards I had multiple police stood in my room, the two that had brought me and Xavier back and a handful of others, a collection of psychologists and the doctor who was my primary attendant.



The psychologist explained that I appeared to have a serious case of Aphantasia.



That was a couple hours ago, and I can’t stop hearing his words, his explanation. My therapist had been told apparently, she didn’t believe, even with all the evidence that was apparently given, she said I had seen things that weren’t real too much for that.



It’s terrifying to know that I am unable to voluntarily picture things. I have no visual imagination. That I don’t remember my dreams because my brain is unable to latch onto images it creates itself. That most of my memory problems is because I am unable to properly recall visual stimuli.



But I think, the most terrifying thing is that I still remember most of what happened. I remember the giant bird tracks, and the giant bird in the tree. I remember them. And it’s terrifying to understand that implication.



Now we’re all waiting for Xavier to wake and explain what he’s sure happened.



And I want to know how he figured out the birds before me.
