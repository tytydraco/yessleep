We used to play everything together, whether it be minecraft, Black Ops 2, or Halo 3. We always had a blast. We met in middle school, and we were both considered the misfits of our grade. We easily got along, and we bonded over video games heavily.
Soon, we added each other on xbox, and the rest was history. 

A few years went by, and it was 2013. That summer, I  got the call... He passed away. I stopped playing video games  after that for a while. It reminded me too much of him.  The reason I am telling you all this is because a week ago I got an xbox One. I got it for my 25th birthday, and I was excited. For two days, everything was great, and then something would happen that would haunt me forever.
My best friend Ian.... was online. 

Now he had two brothers, so I at first thought it was one of them. But it looked exactly like Ian's account, Nothing was changed.  I kept in touch with one of his brothers, so I texted him. He was very confused. He then proceeded to tell me no one has access to Ians account. After that, I got a bit angry so I messeged the account.

> Me: How did you get access to this account?"
   .......Nothing

> Me:  "I hope it was worth it, hacking into this account. I just repor..........."

I got a response before I could send the message.
I decided after that to record everything in a text document, and it would be easier to just show you what I wrote at that time.

DAY 1
>"What the fuck, what the actual fuck? How did they know my name? My name is not public on xbox, and they knew about my dad's passing. I texted Ian's brother to let him know what I just experienced, and he was a bit disturbed as well.  He said he was going to try to find the account information and delete it. Ian's account went offline, and I will record anything here if I hear anything."

 DAY 2
>"Ian's brother, Casey, texted me this morning. He told me he was unable to find the account information. I kept on getting messages all day from Ian's account. Call me crazy but I was starting to believe somehow. Someway, it was him. He knew things, things only me and him would know. 

DAY 3
>"He joined my minecraft game. It was a single-player game. How is that even remotely possible? He just would follow me around and stare. He was always there. It creeped me out. I eventually switched my game to black ops 2 and was playing zombies. He joined again, and it was the same. He kept on staring, and then he was gone."

DAY 4
>"I'm starting to believe it is definitely not Ian. Something is posing as him. I got another message.... he told me I should come with him. He then invited me to a party chat. When I joined, a loud, high-pitched ringing started playing, and I threw my headphones across the room. Then... a voice started speaking through. It sounded like Ian, but something was off. I got freaked out again and turned off my xbox. I got a text from an unknown number, and it said he just wants me to come with him."

DAY 5
>"I removed him as a friend. It wasn't Ian. I had to remind myself that. Somehow, it didn't stop. I am still getting party invites and messages. It's getting aggressive. I am thinking about selling my xbox. I can't handle it."

DAY 6
>"I don't feel safe in my own damn home. Something is watching me. It knows I know it's not Ian. Last night, after I got off my xbox, I found a note on my bedroom door. It said, "It will take me with it."  My blood ran cold.and I almost passed out. Today, I sold my xbox. I decided it was too much to deal with."

DAY 7
>"Today, I saw something walk down into my basement. I'm scared shitless."
