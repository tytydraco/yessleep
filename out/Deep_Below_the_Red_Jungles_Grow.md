I am a solo hiker in the western Cascades, and frequently go out to the forests near my town. The specific region of woods that I frequent is a nameless stretch of immensely dense temperate rainforest which has almost never been disturbed by human activity beyond the felling of a few specific trees for lumber over a hundred years ago, of which the massive stumps remain.

It is virtually impossible to explore the entirety of even a fifty square meter stretch of woods like this, as there is just so much *stuff.* Each hike you will inevitably find some novel and interesting tapestry of nature. Combine this with the fact that the full scale of the Cascadian forest stretches across hundreds of kilometers, the woods around my town have always had an air of awe and mystery to them, as well as an air of uncanniness at the sheer scale of wilderness and what could be hiding within.

In addition, while it may not seem relevant now in my story, my town and the surrounding woods lie directly on top of a set of ancient fault lines stretching god knows how deep into the hundreds of millions of years old rock. This will come into play later, as I believe these fractures to be the source of my encounters.

**The following is transcribed from my hiking journal throughout late July of 2021, and is mostly left faithful to how it was originally written.**

Jul 23 - Wonderful woods, bobcat tracks, and mystery growths.  
\------  
The day was pleasant, the temperature not being too oppressive for a clear summer sky. I had decided to deviate from my normal path into the forest, going eastward into the deeper, wetter woods where the only semblance of human activity were the planes flying overhead. My plan was to stay out in the woods for at most two nights. This was the day I set out, armed with a popup tent, enough food and water to supply me for several days, as well as a pack of various survival tools/gear.

For the majority of the day, nothing particularly unusual happened. It was just me, my bags, and my compass travelling eastwards through some of the most beautiful nature you could ever see. I saw a multitude of common critters such as squirrels, deer, and even some old bobcat tracks in the mud. However, sometime near sunset's approach, I found something rather strange.  
  
I had picked up a rather pretty granite rock to get a closer look at the crystal structure, when I noticed a series of dull crimson colored polyp-like growths on the underside of the rock where it had been embedded in the moss. These growths were small, only about a centimeter long at most, and with a rubbery looking texture. I had never seen anything quite like this, but it did not strike me as unexplainable. There are countless plant, insect, and fungus species in these woods, and just because I have never seen something does not mean that it is an abnormality. Still worth documenting though, even if it probably is just the cocoons of some odd insect or something of the sort.

Jul 23 night - Strange noises and more growths.  
\------  
Tonight, things have been strange, and I am starting to feel uneasy about this trip. I had set up camp in a little depression underneath a fallen cedar tree, likely blown down during the winter windstorms. While clearing sticks and rocks out of the way so I could set my tent up, I found several more of those growths. They were similar in shape and color, though now were appearing in clusters of two to ten or so. In addition, these ones seemed larger, with some surpassing two centimeters. The sudden increase in density and size compared to where I had seen them earlier gave me an uneasy feeling, though I found it easy enough to brush that feeling aside and just set my tent up pushed to the side as to avoid squishing a few particularly large clusters.

The evening was fairly uneventful, and sleep came for me fast. However, at some point I awoke in the dead of night. It was impossible to tell the time given that a thick fog had rolled in and obscured the night sky. The first alarm that something was not off was the silence of the forest. Usually, even at night, some critter would be yapping its head off. However, now, it was just perfect silence. 

Silence like that usually means some sort of predator is nearby, possibly a bear or even a cougar. My suspicions that I was not alone were confirmed, when I heard a call of some sort emanate from deeper down in the valley. The call was shrill, sounding almost like a squeak or a chirp, with a slight warble. This sound would be repeated three or four times before stopping for a minute and then starting back up again. Hearing the chirping, my brain immediately went "cougar" and I froze. Even though the sounds appeared distant, I still felt more scared for my life than I had since the home invasion a few years back. Eventually though, the sounds stopped, and after what felt like an hour at least, sleep came for me again.

Jul 24 - Downhill. Downhill fast.  
\------  
Today was when shit really hit the fan. When morning came I was determined to leave the area as soon as possible, as I did not want to be in the hunting grounds of what I had assumed to be a big cat. Oh how wrong I was in that assumption.

Pretty much as soon as I woke up, I was packing my things up and heading out of the valley. I believed I was going south, closer to civilization, however I later found out that my compass had failed me. The little bearing on which the needle that rotates had gotten stuck, and in my hurry I did not bother to check if it was actually rotating. I assumed that since I had pulled it out and it was facing directly ahead, that if I started walking in the opposite direction I would be going south. Only after an hour of nervous walking did I think to pill it out again and check.

After realizing my terrible mistake, I sat down and began to hit the compass against my knee in an attempt to get the troublesome needle to unstick itself. After three good hits, the compass was spinning again, and that's when I noticed them. The growths. They were everywhere in the underbrush, some as massive as my hand. In addition, there were several other distinct features. There were stringy red vines only a millimeter thick snaking across the ground and up around the bases of the scraggly brush filling the hillside. There were spiny scarlet shoots the size of my finger jutting out from the moss on the logs. There were flat, dried blood colored disk shaped masses the size of quarters growing on the undersides of some leaves. It was at this point I knew, without a doubt, that this was very much not natural.

I stood up and just gazed out at the woods. Now, without the adrenaline of trying to speedwalk through waist high ferns, I saw things clearly. Red specks on everything in the woods, staring back at me like a million alien eyes. 

I was trying to make sense of what I was seeing. Was it a disease? Was it a rare native plant? Was it honest-to-god alien life? No explanations made sense in my head. While standing there, I heard the noise from last night again, just as distant sounding. Instinctively, I turned around to look behind me in the direction of where the noise had come from, and I saw it. I saw the thing that had been stalking me for hours.   
  
It looked nothing like any earthly creature, being instead a bizarre mass of sunburned flesh and indiscernible features. It was tall, around two meters so. Its body was roughly cylindrical, seeming almost bulbous. It had no arms, but instead had a pit in the center of its "torso" which appeared to be full of small tendrils. In this pit, it held a small stick, the tendrils wrapped around it tightly. The creature had three legs, the length of which constituted the majority of its height. Each leg had four, maybe five joints, being something of a grey area between leg and tentacle. The creature's "head" was roughly triangular in shape, being directly attached to the torso without any semblance of a neck. It had a series of dark spots which might have been eyes arranged in a ring around the upper part of its head. I saw no discernable ears, mouth, or any other human feature. This was an unknown. Closest thing I could compare it to would be some sort of deep sea abomination.

I have no idea how long me and that...*thing* stared at each other for, but eventually it made that same awful noise. The noise sounded the same as the previous two times, though now it was very apparent that it was NOT distant. That thing had been just a few meters from my tent last night. As soon as I heard the noise, I booked it. I ran as fast as I could in the opposite direction, not minding that my pants were getting torn to shreds.

I ran like my life depended on it, as I believe it very well did in the moment. The fact that the crimson vegetation was becoming more and more frequent and apparent was the least of my concerns.   
  
Jul 25 - Red hell.  
\-----  
I fell. I fell hard. I rolled down a steep hillside and into a rushing stream. My memories of this part are hazy, all I know is that I was knocked around into logs and rocks by the water until I eventually lost consciousness by fault of a boulder in the middle of the stream. When I came to, I was pretty beaten up. At least I was alive though. The sun was rising, indicating that I had been unconscious on the river shore for the entirety of the night. Unconscious with that creature roaming about. I was still somewhat delirious from the hit to my head, and it took a few minutes to register where I was.

I looked around, and my heart sunk. There was no green anywhere, just shades of red. The alien landscape I was looking out at was not large, as I could see green, still living trees a ways away. The trees within the zone of complete biosphere replacement had all died off, seeming to have been dead for a long time given the lack of remaining small branches. In place of everything earthly was a jungle of numerous distinct and seemingly thriving organisms.

Everything had a somewhat fleshy appearance to it. There were the polyp-like growths I saw first, just scaled up dramatically and now with rows of pores visible across their surfaces. There were scarlet vines which stretched out across the "forest" floor like a network of sickly arteries and veins. There were web-like masses stretched between the trunks of dead trees, from which bulbous sacs hung, dripping some sort of dark grey fluid onto the ground below. There was a pervasive red moss which clung to every surface it could. There were massive ridged disks jutting out at haphazard angles from the bases of the dead trees. There were tall, spindly shoots reaching twice my height topped with barbed flower shaped orifices, of which one almost seemed to begin to lean towards me. It was a mesmerizing, terrifying, and strangely beautiful sight. Like a mix between gazing into the Amazon Rainforest and gazing into the inner workings of a body.

Seeing the subtle movements of the stalk I could only assume was carnivorous, I began to run again. My only way forwards was through, and I paid little attention to the carnal tropics around me as I ran. I never passed through the direct center, though I saw a large slab of stone with what seemed to be a fissure running down it. I assumed this to be the middle, and while running I'm pretty sure I saw a creature similar to the one that was stalking me approach the fissure, *deflate* its body somehow, and slide in. 

Eventually, I reached the green once more. Now was time for me to get home. The day was still new, and I knew that if I went directly north, I would inevitably find a forest service road that I could follow to civilization, as the logging woods were to the north. The rest of the day was blissfully uneventful, albeit sore and pained. I will likely keep out of my journal now unless something else worth writing down happens, as I would currently rather focus on getting home.

End of journal  
\-----  
Eventually I did get home, after two days of wandering down an abysmally curvy forest service road that looked like it hadn't been driven on in years. Eventually, I reached a main road and was able to pick up a ride. The driver asked me lots of questions, which was expected given my bloody, battered state. I simply just told him I had gotten lost and taken a fall, which was as much truth as he needed to know.

I believe I had encountered some sort of deep-crust biosphere seeping up into the surface world. The rocks here are hundreds of millions of years old, and riddled with fault lines and rifts. Far too tight of a squeeze for humans, but not for whatever life has been evolving and festering down there, kilometers below the surface, for eons. 

Now, before I go, I want to share one last piece of information. 

There are two common plants here, English Ivy and Himalayan Blackberry. Both of these plants are invasive species brought over from a completely different region. In their home region they stay under control as they are a part of the local ecosystem. However, upon being brought over to the west coast, these plants went out of control due to a lack of predation. Now, ivy strangles trees and forms impenetrable walls of vines, while blackberries cover entire hillsides and fields in brambles.   
  
I fear that lifeforms which have evolved specifically to thrive in the most extreme regions possible, being compressed and heated constantly, will absolutely plunder the energy-rich and water-saturated surface world. I fear that one of these days, I will find deep red hued growths hiding in my lawn. I fear that one of these days, I will see the red jungles grow where all the green forests once stood.
