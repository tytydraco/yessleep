I've been stuck in my room for 46 hours.

Yes, my situation is exactly as the title suggests. Although my family has a history of paranormal activities, I never thought that I would be in situation. I would like to start with how I ended up here, The last I can recall is that I was on a discord call with a group of my friends. Whilst one of them was talking, I heard my door knob begin to slightly and yet calmly rattle. It rattled for about 10 minutes before pausing, but then it started up again but this time it became more violent. Eventually, I told my friends that I had to go, because I was hungry and haven't eaten in a bit. I left the call but when I approached my door the rattling stopped. I hesitantly attempted to open the door, however it didn't open. I tried and tried for about an hour before sitting down on my bed. I wasn't doing anything or even moving, I just sat there, staring at a wall.

Whilst I was staring blankly my phone began to ring. "DING" Before I even had time to answer, it stopped but I got pinged by a friend, asking me if I was ok. I responded stating that I'm fine because I did not want to seem crazy.

I walked over to my door once more and attempted to kick it open, however it didn't budge, it didn't even try to pop open, it felt as if something heavy was on the other side holding it shut. Because it was late I decided that I could go without food and just went to sleep, believing that I might be able to open it the next day.

The next day I woke up and tried to open the door again, this time the knob did not even turn, that day I went without any food and only drank water from the half drunken water bottle on my desk. Throughout the day I tried to open the door. There was nothing important that happened on this day however.

Today, day 3. I woke up and tried the door again. This time it opened. Despite it being morning, the hallway was pitch black, as I stepped out I saw a tall stretched figure standing in the hallway. Even though it was highly dark and I couldn't see, the dark figure stood out and was clear to see. Something about it was terrifying. Its back and limbs were fixed in a way I cant describe. The only thing repeating in the back of my mind was telling me to run back into my room and lock the door. It is currently 11 pm and I have only been drinking old Fanta that has been in my room for days. I no longer feel safe within my room.

So here I find myself, at my desk, writing about these 3 days. I will likely update if I'm not dead by the time I get out.
