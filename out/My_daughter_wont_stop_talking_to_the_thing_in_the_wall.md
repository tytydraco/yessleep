It started with the giggling.

Soft, strange, like she was trying to hold it in. I figured she was playing pretend — nothing unusual for a four-year-old. But then I heard her whispering.

Not just words, but whole conversations.

Always through the wall.

“Who are you talking to, sweetie?” I asked one night as I tucked her in.

She smiled and pointed at the corner where the wallpaper had started to peel.

“Benny,” she said.

We don’t know any Bennys.

I asked her what he looked like.

“He’s small,” she said. “He doesn’t have skin, but he has lots of smiles.”

I laughed it off. Kids say weird stuff. But then I started hearing him too.

At first, it was soft — like static behind drywall. Then clearer.

At 3:12 AM every night, I hear whispering in the baby monitor. Not my daughter. A man’s voice. Dry and wet at the same time. Like leaves rotting in a drain.

He says her name.

Over and over.

“Maggie. Maggie. Maggie.”

I stopped sleeping. I moved the baby monitor into my room. Disconnected it from the wall. Still, the voice came through. I even pulled it apart with a screwdriver.

That night, I woke up to it crackling on again.

She wasn’t in bed.

I found her in the corner, whispering to the peeling wallpaper. She didn’t even look at me. Just said, “Shh. Benny’s sleeping now.”

The next day, I called a contractor. Had him tear open that section of the wall while Maggie was at her grandma’s.

Behind the drywall was a hollow space.

No insulation. No wires.

Just a rotting, child-sized mattress.

And on the wall above it, written in what looked like old blood:
“You let me in.”

I burned the mattress. Patched the wall. Painted it over. I didn’t tell Maggie. I didn’t want to scare her. I told myself it was over.

Last night, I woke up to giggling again.

Not hers.

Two voices now.

I opened her door.

She was sitting in the corner, facing the wall.

The wallpaper was peeled back again.

She turned and smiled at me. Her mouth was too wide.

“Daddy,” she whispered. “Can Benny come live in your walls too?”

She said it so sweetly. Like she was asking for a puppy.

I didn’t answer.

I couldn’t. My throat locked up the moment she turned around. Something about the way her mouth hung open—too wide, too still—made my chest feel like it had filled with ice water.

Her eyes looked normal. But they weren’t seeing me. They were looking through me.

I picked her up and brought her to bed. Her body was cold. Not sick-cold. Empty-cold. Like she’d been outside all night. She fell asleep instantly. Or maybe she pretended to. Her breathing didn’t sound right. Too even. Too measured. Like it was copying the sound.

I didn’t sleep. I just watched the wall.

At 3:12 AM, I heard it again.

But this time, the voice wasn’t in the monitor. It was inside the drywall. Right above my bed.

It whispered my name.

“Daddy.”

My blood turned to cement. It sounded just like her. But it wasn’t. There was something stretched in the tone, like the words were being pushed through a throat that didn’t belong to them.

I moved Maggie into my room the next morning. Blocked off the closet. Stuffed towels under the door. She didn’t complain. She just stood at the window, humming.

That night, I caught her drawing on the wall with something red. I thought it was a marker.

It wasn’t.

When I took it from her, it was warm. A little too warm.

And the drawing wasn’t scribbles this time.

It was a door. Right where the wallpaper had peeled. And beneath it, three stick figures. One taller, two smaller. Only one of them had a face.

I asked her what it was.

She smiled.

“Benny said we’re a family now.”

I lost it. Grabbed my keys, drove her to my sister’s house, and told her I needed a few days to clear my head. I didn’t mention the drawings. Or the mattress in the wall. Or the voice that wasn’t hers.

I just needed to think.

The house was quiet that night.

But not silent.

At 3:12 AM, I heard something walking inside the walls.

Slow. Dragging. Like wet feet on wood.

And then the voice came again. Right behind the drywall, inches from my head.

Only it didn’t say my name this time.

It said,
“You let me in. You don’t get to leave.”

I turned on every light in the house. Tore the wall open with a crowbar. There was nothing inside. No cavity. No mattress. No blood.

Just wood.

Except… the new paint in Maggie’s room had been peeled back.

And underneath it, in that same childlike scrawl, was a message I hadn’t written:

“You live in the walls now.”

I don’t know how long I’ve been here.

I still walk around. I still see people. But no one looks at me anymore.

It’s like I’m just part of the house.

Sometimes, at 3:12 AM, I see my daughter through the walls.

She doesn’t smile anymore.

But he does.

The house doesn’t breathe the way it used to.

Not when I was in it. Not when I was of it.

I don’t eat. I don’t sleep. I watch.

That’s all I’m allowed to do now.

Sometimes I try to move the way I used to. Walk like I’m still human. But my legs don’t work right. They bend too much. My bones creak in the wrong places. I catch glimpses of myself in the reflection of pipes and broken glass.

I’m taller now.

Or stretched.

I think the walls are shaping me.

I still see Maggie.

She’s not the same either.

She doesn’t draw anymore. She doesn’t hum. She just sits in her bed, staring at the corners of the room. Like she’s waiting for the wallpaper to move.

Sometimes, it does.

I watch it from behind.

Something wriggles just beneath the surface — not me, something else. It traces her name across the plaster. Backward. Over and over.

E-I-G-G-A-M.

She never blinks.

She knows I’m here.

She just doesn’t look at me.

She looks through me. Like I’m part of the drywall now. And maybe I am.

Last night, I reached through a vent in her room. Just to touch her hair. Just to feel something real again.

She didn’t scream.

She just whispered:

“You’re not my daddy. Benny says you’re a copy.”

That word cut deeper than anything.

Copy.

That’s what I am now.

I think I remember being a man once. I think I remember holding her, feeding her, singing to her when she was sick. But the more I reach for those memories, the further away they float. Like they belong to a dream someone else had.

I hear Benny now.

All the time.

He’s bigger than I thought. Not a child. Not really. He just wears that voice when it suits him.

Sometimes I see him crawling behind the insulation. Limbs spidering in opposite directions. No face — just a smooth, glistening mask with a smile carved into it.

He doesn’t speak with a mouth.

He speaks through walls. Through vents. Through the spaces you pretend don’t exist between your bedroom and the dark.

He told me something last night.

He said there’s room for more.

I asked him what that meant.

He didn’t answer.

But this morning, I watched my sister unlock the front door. She was holding Maggie’s hand.

They’re moving back in.

And I can hear the house waking up again.
