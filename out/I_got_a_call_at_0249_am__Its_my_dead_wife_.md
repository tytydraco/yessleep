It was 2:49 AM when my phone started vibrating on the nightstand. Half-asleep, I reached for it, and my fingers blindly fumbling in the dark. But as soon as I saw the caller ID, my breath hitched.

It was my wife.

My hand trembled. My mind raced. This couldn’t be happening. She had been dead for a week. I buried her myself—I saw the coffin lower into the ground. My chest tightened as cold sweat gathered at the nape of my neck.

Maybe someone else had her phone? But that didn’t make sense. Her phone was in my drawer. I had put it there after the funeral. Slowly, I turned my head toward the dresser. The drawer was still shut.

The call ended.

I sat there, heart hammering against my ribs, trying to convince myself it was just some sick joke or a glitch. Then, I heard it—

Drip.

A single drop of water echoed from the bathroom.

Drip. Drip.

But wait, I fixed that tap this morning. There was no way it could be leaking again. My stomach twisted. I turned my head slowly, staring at the darkened bathroom doorway. The silence pressed down on me like a weight.

Then my phone rang again.

This time, it was a FaceTime call.

No name. No number. Just a blank screen.

I hesitated but reached for the phone, my fingers hovering over the screen. But before I could answer, something caught my eye—the framed picture of me and my wife on my bedside table.

It was gone.

The call ended.

A cold, suffocating dread filled the room. Every hair on my body stood on end. I gripped the sheets, my breath shallow, my mind screaming at me to run. But before I could even move, my gaze drifted to the corner of the room.

And that’s when I saw a shadow at the corner of the room near the bathroom gate Oh dang i saw her.

A shadowed figure, crouched in the darkness, her ethereal shoulders trembling. Her face was buried into the wall, long, damp strands of hair sticking to her ghostly skin.

She was weeping, the sound of her muffled weeping crawled and slithered.

The sound slithered into my ears, each muffled sob a dagger slicing through the silence. My chest tightened. My breath hitched.

My legs? I couldn’t move.

A paralyzing cold spread from my feet, creeping up my spine like fingers of ice. My muscles locked. My mind screamed, but my body was a prisoner to something greater—something I was seeing but can't believe. This wasn’t fear anymore.

This was pure, unfiltered dread.

And then, something changed.

The air in the room became thick. The shadow seemed to be deepened, stretching unnaturally across the walls. A strange pressure built in my ears, like I was sinking underwater. The light from my phone screen flickered, casting an erratic glow across the room. My breath came in short, panicked gasps.

Then, her sobbing stopped.

Silence. Absolute and unnatural.

My ears rang from the sudden absence of sound. My heart pounded in my chest like a war drum. The figure in the corner remained still, unmoving, as if frozen in time. But something was wrong.

The shadows around her shifted. Twisted. They pulsed like something was breathing within them.

And then—

A soft scraping noise. A slow, deliberate dragging sound, like nails running down the wooden floor. It was coming from behind me.

I didn’t dare turn around. Every instinct screamed at me to move, to flee, to escape whatever had crept into my room. My body was locked in place, but my mind was spiraling into panic. My vision blurred, spots dancing at the edges of my sight.

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.

The mirror on the dresser. It reflected the corner where she sat. But in the mirror—she wasn’t crouched. She wasn’t weeping.

She was standing.

And she was staring right at me.

That was it. The final crack in my already fractured sanity. A strangled gasp escaped my lips as I lunged out of bed, stumbling towards the door. My limbs felt heavy, as if something unseen was clawing at me, trying to hold me back.

The door. Just reach the door.

My fingers grazed the doorknob, slick with sweat. I yanked at it desperately, but it wouldn’t budge. The air behind me turned icy. My breath came out in ragged, frantic bursts.

Then, the lights flickered.

And the last thing I heard before everything went black—

Was a whisper.

A voice I knew too well, right against my ear.

"Why did you leave me?"
