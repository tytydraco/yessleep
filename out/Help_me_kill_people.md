I lifted her hand up. The bright white light that hummed from above made the metal table she lay on shine, every stain and scratch exposed to its intensity. Her bruises looked like the large ugly knots that litter an otherwise prestine wooden floor. She had put up a fight, and a damned good one too. I am in the learning process, and having realised that my dream of becoming a famous writer is not possible, I settled to be infamous. This woman was my first project.

I dropped her hand with a thud, and turning to grab my notebook, I opened the first page and titled it "Project One". I looked up at her nude body before continuing writing.

"Female" I jotted "stabbed". I thought for a moment and then erased the last word. "Tried to stab, had to resort to choking". What else would you write about her? Her age? Comment on her appearance? What was the point? It shouldn't matter. I shrugged and looked down before scribbling "looks like a Karen".

Placing the notebook down, I looked at her closely once again. Stab wound in her left hand, her side, her buttock, her cheek. My back groaned at the memory of her knocking me to the ground, and in my panic I thrusted the blade for her head and only punctured her jaw. I could have very well been dead hadn't I managed to somehow get on top of her and gripping her throat.  I eyed the bruises about her neck, before picking the book back up. Beneath my own writing, in neat cursive read "She does, doesn't she? Think of the managers you've saved"

I tutted, and ignored his attempts at humour "need to work on hitting critical points, or to cease stabbing altogether and explore other methods". I looked back up at the corpse on the table in front of me "I also need to choose lighter targets". Once more I closed the book and circled the table to examine the killing blow at a closer angle. The bruises looked like a blue/brown scarf, knit tightly around a pale neck. Certainly, I had held on to her neck for a long time, even after I knew she had stopped breathing, but somehow these looked bigger than my hands, almost claw-like. Rolling my eyes I opened the book once more.

"She has a totem pole of chins doesn't she?"

"Did you help me kill her?" I asked, ignoring the cursive writing.

"..." 

"I told you I wanted to do it myself"

"You couldn't have" the words appeared letter by letter "she was winning the fight"

"How am I meant to improve if you do it FOR me?"

"I apologise for ensuring it was her that'd I be feeding on and not you. I will remember to remember your ingratitude in future circumstances"

The lights dimmed slightly, before flickering, revealing a rail thin figure in the corner of the room who promptly disappeared when the light steadied itself, and hummed healthily once more.

I looked down "you know what I mean."

"Finish your writing." The writing scribbled quickly back, the quality of the writing suggested impatience and anxiety. "I'm hungry"

I drew a line beneath our conversation, signalling that I had finished everything I wanted to do. Closing the book, I tipped the table and watched as the corpse unstuck from the cold tabletop and flopped unceremoniously to the tiled floor. Her buttocks and sides shaking slightly, as her nose broke against the floor.

"Don't make a mess" I spoke out loud as I walked out the door and into the hallway.

I know he means well, of course he does, but can anyone suggest ways of killing people easily? Something where he won't feel the need to help me. Thanks.
