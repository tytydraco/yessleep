Filming progressed rapidly. Director Hampton wanted to finish up the scenes that were shot off-site first, so we could move on to interior and controlled environments. There wasn’t too much hassle once we got into a routine, but it was hard to ignore what I’d seen. Whenever things were going smoothly, all I could imagine was what horrors were happening behind closed doors. There wasn’t a doubt in my mind that Roy Hampton was doing more than just directing a movie – but it was hard to put into words just what I suspected.

About a week passed without incident. Seb and I got a little less to do as we transitioned to finished sets, so we were occasionally tasked with clearing out off-site gear and props. Going through places we’d filmed to make sure we didn’t leave anything behind or did any damage that might piss off the owners.

Then, we were ordered to clear out the Blue House. The place where we’d filmed lead actress Dawn Andersen as her character conversed with an imperceptible deity. The place that’d once had teeth growing out of the walls.

I wasn’t too enthused about the idea.

 

Seb and I were the first on-site. Mostly clearing out staples left in the walls, extra cables, putting furniture back in order, that kind of thing. And, of course, we were instructed not to move the wooden crate in the middle of the room. That came with the house, apparently. Last time we were there, we’d tip-toed around it like it was a landmine.

It didn’t take long to get through the work order. We’d barely done anything to the place, and now that there weren’t any unnatural growths coming out of the woodwork, we were peachy. The two runners we had helping us out spent most of the day smoking and going through some old magazines they’d found upstairs.

I got some time to sit down with Seb in his ’68 Frogeye Sprite. We drove onto the property so we could look out over the cliffside while he blasted some Hendrix. I still had a hard time picturing him as a family man, given our last conversation.

 

“About the, uh… kid. Was it planned?” I asked.

“Kinda,” nodded Seb. “Always wanted kids.”

“Really?” I smiled. “You don’t seem like the type.”

“Dreamt about it since I was a teenager. Gonna have two boys. John and Keith.”

“Got it all figured out, huh?”

“A man’s gotta have a plan.”

“Then… what if it’s a girl?”

“God already promised me,” he smiled. “God ain’t got no reason to change their mind.”

 

We stayed there for about an hour. I leaned back and napped in the passenger seat while Seb turned up the volume on All Along the Watchtower. If that’d been the rest of the shoot, I would’ve been okay with it. Some work, some rest – no nightmares.

As we went inside to finish up, we noticed the two runners standing on each side of the wooden crate. They were trying to lift it.

I didn’t realize it at first, but they must’ve forgotten that we weren’t supposed to move it – that it came with the house. But before me or Seb got the chance to say anything it was already too late.

 

See, the front of the crate had been nailed to the floor, but the back was nailed to a rotting plank. So when the runners lifted it straight up, it tilted forward, and broke wide open. Apparently, it wasn’t as sturdy as one would’ve thought.

As the top of the crate burst open, I was expecting a little dust, some books, or maybe some clothes. Old doodads that had been kept around for good measure. Instead, rolling out on the wooden splinters, was this big lump of stone-like mass.

At first I didn’t know what it was. It was large and gray, like a polished lump of coal. There were also little white things crawling across it. Dozens of moths took flight out of the bottom of the crate.

 

Then I saw it. A familiar shape, bent in an unfamiliar way.

This lump of coal had once been a person.

 

The faint outline of the skull and shoulders were the most immediate giveaway, but after a while I could spot the fingers as well; broken and bent in every which way. One leg in a fetal position, another bent sideways across the body in an unnatural angle. Like someone had done their best to just push them into the crate, no matter how much damage was done to the body.

And the moths. While a dozen or so happily fluttered about the room, I could count hundreds of maggots crawling across the body. It was almost like a pattern, zig-zagging across the bends of broken bones and twisted face muscles.

We all just stared at it for a moment. One of the runners poked it with his foot, tipping it slightly. It was hard as a stone. As it rocked back and forth, some of the maggots tumbled onto the floor.

 

Seb bent down, looking at it closely. The other runner, a guy in his early 50’s with a sizable gut, crossed his arms and scoffed.

“It’s gotta be prop,” he said. “Put it back in the box.”

“I ain’t touching it,” said the other runner. “Shit’s probably diseased.”

“If it was a prop, they would’ve asked us to bring it in,” said Seb.

“But they did though,” said the first runner. “They asked us to.”

“No, they didn’t,” I added. “This came with the house.”

“Bullshit.”

 

While they tried their best not to show it, I could tell the runners were just as shaken as we were. They wrapped their hands in towels before they dared to touch it, and even then, they decided to just tilt the box back up and leave it as-is.

As we wrapped up for the day, the runners took off – heading into town to get a sandwich. Seb and I drove off too, but stopped about halfway back to the set. Seb pulled over and parked by the side of the road, turning down the radio. He shook his head, as if trying to convince himself to say something. Finally, he sighed.

“We gotta call the police,” he said. “We can’t pretend this is normal.”

“You think it wasn’t a prop?”

“With everything you’ve seen here, do you honestly think that wasn’t real?”

The answer was obvious.

 

We took a detour through town, stopping at a payphone outside the supermarket. We got a few side-eyes from the locals, looking us up and down as Seb talked to the sheriff over the phone. I saw one woman leaving with her 7-year-old daughter. The kid waved at me with a little “hello”, and I waved back, only to see the mother pulling her away. Maybe they didn’t like outsiders. Or maybe they just didn’t like us.

I also couldn’t help but notice how there was a clothing store just across the street, selling shirts, dress jackets, and coats. Very similar to the clothes to what we’d seen hung from trees outside our set; as a threat. A handful of blank-faced mannequins proudly displayed a variety of neatly pressed shirts.

I started to get the idea that not only were we seen as outsiders, but as an actual threat. And given what I’d seen over the past couple of weeks, I wasn’t sure they were wrong.

Seb tapped me on the shoulder, snapping me out of my spiraling paranoia.

“We’re meeting them back at the house,” he said. “Let’s go.”

 

As we got back in the car, I noticed the mother staring at us from across the street, firmly clutching a golden cross around her neck. Our eyes met for a moment. I could tell she was scared. I saw her shoulders move with her heavy breathing. We weren’t just outsiders to her – we were dangerous.

As we drove off, I could still see her looking at us through the rear-view mirror. A stark reminder that no matter who we were, and what we were doing here, we weren’t welcome in Chatter Blinds.

 

We pulled up outside the Blue House again. We didn’t have to wait long for the sheriff to arrive. I got the impression that they’d been called out a lot these past few days. There’d been the break-in, the debacle at the cave, and now this. And that was just the immediate issues – who knew what else had been going on?

They pulled up to the house, and we escorted them inside. All the while, they kept talking to one another.

“Yeah, this house is derelict,” the deputy said. “I’m not sure you’re allowed to film here.”

“They got the lease,” the sheriff added. “I don’t like it, but it’s above board. They know the owner.”

“Yeah, but-“

“It is what it is.”

 

As we entered the living room, Seb pointed them to the wooden crate. Moths were still fluttering about, forcing the deputy to wave them off with his hat. As they removed the loosely added lid of the crate, a few more moths fluttered out.

And the body was gone.

 

“What am I missing here?” the sheriff asked.

Seb just shook his head and looked at me. Maybe the runners moved it, or the director. Either way, someone got back there ahead of us. Probably someone from the closed set, as that was closer than downtown Chatter Blinds.

“Someone took it,” I said. “It was there, and-“

“Look, I’m inclined to believe you gentlemen, but if you ain’t got something to show us there ain’t much we can do.”

“We’ll… call you. As soon as something shows up.”

“See that you do,” he continued. “And make sure no one moves it next time.”

They wandered off, leaving me and Seb alone with a moth-laden box and a whole bunch of nothing. The sun turned the horizon a brownish orange, stretching out our shadows. Seb didn’t say a word.

 

We got back in the car and just drove. As we came to a fork in the road, leading us up towards the closed set, Seb kept driving straight through. We missed the exit.

“Where we going?” I asked.

“We’re getting the fuck out of here.”

“Oh yeah?”

“Yeah.”

 

We went past the half-abandoned farmlands, the lone houses overlooking the cliffside, and the various abandoned summer homes. Past the cows grazing on dry grass and the pine trees struggling to keep their needles. The shadows grew longer.

“Why now?” I asked. “After all this – why now?”

“You remember what the script said?” Seb asked. “What it said about the box?”

“Not really.”

“Check the glove box. Got a copy. Page thirty-six.”

 

I clicked it open and pulled out an annotated version of an older script. Turning to the correct page, I got a stark reminder of what the script said. According to the script,  that box contained the priest, or prophet, of some kind of unnamed deity. It was described as the voice of the dead-tongued God.

“Jesus…”

The word just fell out of me. Looking back up at Seb, I was afraid to ask what he thought. I didn’t say a word, but he answered anyway.

“That crate was never supposed to be opened. It’s not a prop. At best we’re looking at a mummified fucking corpse, at worst…”

He shook his head, drawing a breath of his cigarette.

“I don’t wanna think about it,” he sighed. “That’s where I draw the line.”

“A man’s gotta have a plan,” I added.

Seb nodded, flicking the cigarette to the road behind us.

 

We kept going through downtown Chatter Blinds and out past towards the highway. But as we got to a crossroads, Seb slowed down. A cold wind blew through the pine trees. I had barely noticed the dark creeping up on us, as the shadows had melted into night.

As the car came to a stop, I could see something come into view. It vaguely resembled someone in a blue dress, lying halfway across the road – unmoving.

“What is that?” Seb asked. “Is… is that a person?”

“I can’t tell,” I said. “Kinda looks like it.”

We sat there for a few seconds, just to see if it moved. It didn’t. Seb put the car into park.

“I don’t like this,” he muttered. “I really don’t.”

I nodded. I didn’t like it either. Still, we both stepped out to make sure they were okay.

 

As we got closer, the blue dress got tangled in a stiff breeze. At this distance, I couldn’t tell for sure if it was a person, but it was roughly the size of one. Still, it didn’t move, and I couldn’t tell what was up or down. There was a strange pale color to it.

As we got closer, it became apparent that this wasn’t, in fact, a person.

It was just a mannequin in a blue dress. The same kind of blank-faced mannequin I’d seen in the window of that place downtown . The one with the fancy shirts. Seb and I looked at one another as we turned back towards the car.

There was someone there.

 

They must’ve waited by the roadside. Eight people in total; some coming out of the woods, two of them blocking our way back to the car. One man, leaning against the driver’s side of Seb’s car, had a shotgun firmly pointed our direction. On the opposite side of the car was a familiar face.

It was the same woman I’d seen that first night. It was impossible to miss her stringy rose-blonde hair and wiry frame. She held a hammer in her left hand, and what looked like a handful of nails in her right. Other shapes were joining her from the sides; stepping out from the edge of the forest and into the headlights of the car. All with neatly pressed white shirts, black leather belts, and dress pants.

We were surrounded.

 

“Should’ve left while you still could,” she smiled. “Now the train’s passed. Sin’s already stained you.”

“We don’t wanna cause trouble,” Seb said. “I’m heading home. I got a kid, and-“

“You got kin? Waiting at home?” she laughed. “You poor sod, you don’t see it, do you? You can’t feel the taint of those people… curdling your bloodline?”

Seb didn’t answer. He looked at me, as if expecting an answer, or a plan, but I had nothing.

“Hearing those… hellish incantations. Stepping into Satan’s church. You’ve crossed the bridge, and… and paid with the blood of your firstborn. You mark my words, sinner!”

“Then… we’d like to repent,” I said. “Yeah. We, uh… we didn’t know what to-“

“Ignorance is not innocence!”

 

Seb dropped to the ground. He’d been smacked in the back of the knees with a lead pipe. Another man was heading my way with an aluminum bat; ready to do the same to me. I just held my hands up in surrender and got down on my knees. He gave me a firm push, but I was spared any further battery.

“On all fours, sinner,” he spat.

I did as they asked, digging my fingers into the asphalt. I could feel the road salt stinging the skin under my fingernails. I could hear Seb groan off to the side. He probably took a greater hit than I first thought.

The circle closed in around us. A fist grabbed my hair, keeping my head firmly affixed to the ground. I could barely see Seb in my periphery.

“Ariel,” said the man with the shotgun. “We oughta step off the road.”

“This won’t be long,” the woman smiled. “And I don’t think anyone on these roads mind waiting for a good cause.”

 

It was the first time I heard her name, and all these years later, it’s still burned into my mind. Ariel. It sends me back to that moment, staring down at the asphalt. Feeling that cold breeze on my back.

Ariel got down on her knees in front of me, carefully putting her hand on my cheek. She was warm, and trembling. She was excited.

“You got any offspring?” she asked.

“No,” I gasped. “No, I-I… I don’t.”

She patted me on the cheek.

“Good. Then your tainted blood can die with you. Very good.”

“…I don’t want to die.”

“We don’t always get what we want, son.”

 

She moved over to Seb. I could hear her get down on her knees.

“I’m gonna need an address,” she said.

“I ain’t giving you anything,” Seb spat. “Nothing.”

“We’re doing you a kindness,” Ariel explained. “This is not about… killing people. This is about stopping Satan in his tracks. We’re putting out a fire that can burn down the world, son.”

“My boy ain’t gonna hurt anyone.”

“What’s your boy’s name?”

There was a short pause as Seb considered his options. I could hear him get a firm slap, as she repeated the question.

“Your boy’s name, son.”

“John.”

“Well, let me tell you how this is gonna go. With the company you keep, and the taint you carry in your soul, John is gonna live a life of pain and sin. Barred from the gates of heaven to wander, in perpetuity, the empty halls of the forgotten. You want that for your kin?”

There was no answer. Ariel sighed, exasperated.

“Fuck it,” she said. “We got what we came for. Let’s not drag it out.”

 

They pulled us to our feet and pushed us towards the treeline. They turned off Seb’s car and moved the mannequin off the road. I was ready to scream for help at the first sign of a passing car, but no one came. Turns out that road wasn’t quite as popular as one might think.

I could hear the jingle of nails in Ariel’s hand. I could see two men with rope near the treeline, and two more lighting the way with flashlights. They lead us there without a word, but with a soft hum on their lips. A hymn.

“There’s… there’s nothing wrong with us,” Seb said, desperately trying to bargain. “We were leaving. We were getting out.”

“An infection spreads,” said Ariel. “As is the nature of things.”

“We’re not a fucking infection,” Seb growled. “We’re people. I have folks waiting for me at home, we-“

“I understand,” she interrupted. “I hear you. And I’m sorry.”

 

There was something so nonchalant about her way of saying this, but the implications of what was about to happen was starting to dawn on me. I could feel my heart racing, trying to catch up with my thoughts. These people weren’t just here to frighten us, or to make us uncomfortable. They were here to make examples of us – for the others.

With every hand that touched me, I recoiled. I protested, but there were too many of them. I was pushed up with my back against a tree, and before I could say anything, a rope was pulled over my neck and tied by the back of the trunk. Shortly after, my hands were bound.

Ariel stepped back, handing the hammer and nails to one of her associates. She clutched her hands in front of her and closed her eyes. The two flashlights were firmly affixed on us. I could feel myself sweating through my clothes, staining my armpits.

 

“It is my firm belief that you are beyond redemption,” she said. “But it is by God’s words that we aim to forgive and redeem. So by these words, I pray you find salvation.”

They moved up to Seb first. They were gonna nail him to that fucking tree.

“Oh heavenly Father, hallowed be thy name…”

 

As Ariel began her prayer, Seb turned to me. I could see the panic in his eyes as they loosened the rope from his left hand and moved it up the side of the trunk.

“Think of the script,” he said. “Fucking… taint them. Say something.”

His eyes flickered wildly, like a frightened animal. His tone was conversational, but it was… fear. He didn’t dare to scream. It’s as if keeping his voice normal would somehow deter them from treating us like animals.

“What… what are you-“

A firm tap of a hammer, followed by a horrifying shriek of pain; suddenly cut short by someone pulling back on the rope pressing against his neck. I could see Seb’s face turn purple as his scream got stuck in the back of his throat.

My mind raced as I tried to think of what he could mean. I had read the script, but it was all just… fiction. There were parts that were unsettling, but that was natural for a horror movie.

 

But I couldn’t help but to think back on the words that the director had asked me to read, that day back in the Blue House. The highlighted words, the meaning between the lines. The images they’d painted in my mind. Looking at Seb’s bloated face, hesitantly, I stuttered those words.

“Rao soma Eo. Drin… soma Eo.”

The roap tightened around my neck. I couldn’t speak or breathe. My head was bursting at the seams, and my mouth was drier than sand. Still, I mouthed the words to completion.

“Stroe soma Eo. Haughin soma Eo.”

 

Just thinking of those words brought pictures to my mind. A blue fabric, swaying in the breeze. Salt under my fingernails. A great fire. That was the pattern inherent in those words. There was a truth to them. A universal truth. Something that I couldn’t comprehend.

It occurred to me that the pattern had repeated. We’d seen the mannequin dressed in blue, and the way the dress had fluttered in the cold breeze. I’d felt the road salt grind under my fingernails. But there was no great fire.

But there would be. There always would be.

The words didn’t lie.

 

As they untied Seb’s right hand and pushed it back against the trunk, I saw something in the distance. Far behind the men with the flashlights, there was a silhouette. Someone coming our way. Ariel opened her eyes and shuddered, stopping the reciting of her prayer. The others stopped as well and looked to her for guidance. She was furious. Whatever I’d said had cut straight through her prayers.

She flipped up a pocketknife and stormed up to me.

“I’ll rip your fucking tongue out, you fucking-“

 

It all happened in a matter of seconds, but I remember it as an eternity. I remember every detail of Ariel’s sweaty forehead, and the taste of metal on my tongue. That initial cut, and a single drop of blood staining her index finger. And I remember looking past her. And there, stepping into full view, was the coal-shaped figure we’d pulled out of that chest earlier.

 

It’s face and limbs still twisted, struggling to move. Hobbling forward like a broken puppet. Neck firmly broken, leaning against a stiff shoulder. Mouth wide open in a toothless, silent, scream. Maggots still dropping from every crack and corner.

Looking back at it, I feel this deep pain in my chest. Like I surrendered something of mine willingly; freely handing over my pound of flesh. But in that moment, all I could think of was the pattern foretold in the words I’d learned.

There was going to be a great fire.

 

I can still see it in my mind. The tips of Ariel’s rose-blonde hair starting to glow. The man with the shotgun dropping everything to clutch his scalp. The men standing by our sides stepping away, shielding their faces from the sudden warmth.

Fire.

Four of them burst into flames, illuminating the broken creature from every angle. The ill-shaped legs and arms, the inverse torso. A dead, dry tongue. Screams erupted into screeching as they fled, or died. Their prayer shattered to the wind, broken by pain and panic. Ariel’s pocket knife dropping to the ground as she fled like a bat out of hell, her rose-blonde hair curling up to die with the encroaching flames.

In a matter of seconds, all that remained was a sputtering corpse, next to a shotgun, and this… thing. Candle-like flames danced in the undergrowth, but quickly died out.

 

Our attackers spread out across the woods, screaming their prayers and curses into the night. I couldn’t hear them over my pounding heart. Seb had almost passed out from the pain, barely staying awake. I couldn’t get him to look at me. He just hung limplessly from his maimed left hand; still nailed to the trunk of the tree.

A dry hand touched the side of my head; cradling me like a worried parent. A dead face drew closer; an eyeless stare piercing into my mind.

It had heard me. We spoke the same language. It was eager to see me.

 

It spoke to me. It was only a few syllables, but it was… I can’t put it into words. It was a guide. A path. A way to make it through all this and come out on the other side unscathed. I can’t even put to words what they sounded like, or whether it was consonants or vowels. It just was.

In the blink of an eye, I understood. A surge of information burrowed into the back of my mind, promising to help me with everything going forward – if I was open to listen.

To this day, I’m convinced that this single action is what has allowed me to live this long. To outlive all the others. And as that thing left me in those woods, I remember fixating on the first step on that path.

I had to finish the movie – no matter what. I just had to.

 

What happened next was a blur. I remember picking up a hammer with a soot-covered handle and bringing Seb down from that tree. I remember driving his ’68 Frogeye Sprite back to town to call for help. I remember an ambulance, and a knowing nod from the sheriff’s deputy.

And as I returned to the set that night, I did so with a renewed determination. This wasn’t just a movie anymore. This was an event foretold – something I had been bound to complete.

And at that point, I didn’t know if I was going to fight it with every inch of my being, or let fate take its course.

In a way, I still don’t know.
