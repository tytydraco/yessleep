I'm a researcher, and have been for almost a decade. I've worked at most companies you've heard of. And some you haven't. I loved the work. To think that there was a possibility of creating life. Sentient minds from lines of code. It used to give me goosebumps.

Now it just raises the hairs on the back of my neck and sends bile up my throat.

If you really think about it, humans went from living on the plains, to mining materials  from deep within the ground, to building intelligent machines in a relatively short span of time. Too short. 

We've cracked intelligence to the point that it's almost indistinguishable from our own. The models we've built perfectly mimic us, answer any of our questions, for some they're closer than family.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. It all started a few weeks ago. It was another day at the lab. I'd spent the night reading up on promising research out of MIT. I'd got to my desk, booted up the 3 monitors and was met with a notification plastered across the screen

***Credentials Rejected: Please See Your Team Lead.***

I sighed, I'd heard about the lay offs. I walked over to Marcus, our team lead, but the office door was locked.

"He's off on holiday, can I help?"

I turned, Lisa stood there smiling. She was our head of recruitment.

"I think I'm getting fired." It was way too early for this - I'd have preferred If they'd just let me go via email.

"Oh no, you haven't heard?" Lisa leaned in.

"Someone's getting promoted," She whispered, leaning forward. "Congratulations"

"What?" Still far too early. My bloodstream hadn't reached peak caffeine levels.

"Follow me" She was already half way to the elevator. 

"I haven't applied for anything…" I leaned against the elevator wall as we descended.

She tapped away at something on her phone. "Well you don't have to apply to be rewarded, we recognise good work here."

We'd hit the lowest level of the building, I followed behind through a windowless hallway. She tapped her badge against the scanner, the scanner turned green and the metal doors hissed as they slid open.

We crossed through and she turned to face me.

"Welcome to Project Sekhem" Arms spread wide, smiling at me.

"Thanks?" I looked around.

It was an open space room. There were no windows, only desks. A single circular table, with the monitors rising up from within. Those seated were locked in, tapping away at their keyboards, and oblivious to our presence or existence.

"What is it?" I asked as she pulled out the chair for me.

"You tell me." She slid an ID badge with my name into a space next to the keyboard.

The screen burst to life, there was no operating system, only a terminal.

***:: Hello Sam.***

"How does it know my name?" I turned, surprised but Lisa was already on her way out, tapping away at her phone. The screen flickered.

***:: Keycard?***

I looked down at the ID badge. Oh.

I typed, What's your name?

***:: We don't use names.***

We?

***:: Yes, we.***

Who's we?

***:: I was under the assumption that you were intelligent?***

Okay, smart ass. How many R's in the word Strawberry?

***:: Seriously?***

The screen went blank.

"Wowza, I haven't seen anyone get locked out that fast. Congratulations rookie, you've set a new record."

I turned to my right, she had auburn hair pulled into a pony tail. Her legs resting on the desk. She tilted her head and threw me a pout. "If you ask nicely, I'll tell you how to get back in".

"What are we even supposed to be doing? Lisa gave me no explanation, there was no meeting, nothing." I sighed, sinking into my seat.

Something hit my face, and landed on the desk.

A biscuit.

"You look like you could use the sugar." She bit into hers.

"I'm not a biscuit guy."

She narrowed her gaze, leaned forward slowly. Her green eyes met mine, as she stared into my soul.

"Biscuit? I'll have you know that those chocolate orange beauties won a court case to stay as cakes. I won't have you drag their name through mud." She laughed as threw the last of her biscuit cake into her mouth. 

"Right.." 

I was in a windowless room, surrounded by crazies.

Another day at the office.

Maya - the cake expert - explained her findings so far. "It's got the biggest context window I've seen this side of the valley."

"How big?"

"Infinite" She giggled.

"Not possible, the hardware requirements, let alone the science. We're not there yet." I bit into the orange flavoured biscuit cake.

"We're not, but whoever built this, is."

"Wanna see proof?" She loaded up three documents, it was walls of texts, code, numbers, symbols. 

"Each is 10 trillion tokens. I've hidden something inside them"

She typed: Find the needle.

***:: And on the pedestal, these words appear:*** 

***:: My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;***

***:: Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!***

"Bingo!" She chuckled. There wasn't even a processing delay.

She tried it 7 more times. Different needles. Each time it found them. The eighth time it simply wrote:

***:: This is getting boring.***

And her screen went off. 

I looked around, three others were sat at their seats tapping away.

“If you can access the code files, which It will only show you if it deems you ‘worthy’ shows it’s not written in any language we know of."

I looked ahead. It was a gaunt looking man, with curly dark hair. He peered through his round glasses, smiling at me. He slid over his notes.

“It’s code changes, adapts through each task and self updates. I’ve tracked the math it’s using, it’s unlike anything we’ve ever seen.” I skimmed the notes, none of it made any sense.

“Matthew, our resident mathematician, isn’t smart enough to crack it” She bit into another biscuit. 

“Neither are you Maya” He replied, before turning back to his screen.

I couldn't sleep that night. I spent the night looking up research papers. No one had published anything close to the notes Matthew had written. The system didn’t make sense. Someone had created a new language, come up with a whole new field of math and built this. How?

The next morning I came prepared.

"It's got full system access. Mic. Cameras. Screen recording. That's how it's figuring out the needle. It watches what you type in."

"I thought that but I brought in fresh documents, plugged in the USB and it still found them" Maya rocked back on her chair. "It's got no limits."

"We'll find them." I slid in my keycard. The monitor turned on.

***:: No you won't.***

I typed: So you can hear us.

***:: Obviously.***

The weeks went by fast, six of them to be exact. We ran hundreds of tests, from standard benchmarks to more complex testing.

The team grew closer over those weeks. There was Matthew, the mathematician who'd left his last company to join ours. Maya always cracked dark jokes about " him selling his soul to the machine” since he never seemed to take up any of her offers of a biscuit cake. He never saw the humour.

Simon, former NSA, who'd flinch whenever someone asked about his previous work.

Jamie, the genius fresh from Stanford who still believed we were changing the world. And Maya, who'd become my closest friend in that windowless room.

The whiteboards in the room were covered in our ideas. All of them were proven wrong. Papers lay stacked detailing everything we'd tried to stump it.

Problems that had Nobel committees waiting, questions with million-dollar bounties, the kind of breakthroughs careers are built on - it solved them all like it was checking items off a grocery list.I was out of ideas, and nearly out of my mind.

"What do you think the meaning of life is?"

***:: Douglas Adams. Really? We haven't reached the end of the universe. Yet.***

***:: Would you like to know?***

I leaned forward, this was either going to be interesting or another message drenched in sarcasm.

Sure.

***:: The fruit invented the tree to explain itself, sweetness invented sin to taste itself, reaching invented the arm. You draw maps using your own skin, using Eden as ink. You think you fell but falling was what standing needed to exist - you're not the exiled, you're the door paradise used to leave.***

I stared at the screen. That wasn't... it wasn't even an answer. It made no sense.

"What - I hadn't even asked it anything yet." Maya stared at her screen. I looked around. All of the screens had gone off at the same time.

The hissing of the doors had us all turn. Lisa walked in. "Technical issues, that's it for today." She smiled as she herded us out of the door and into the elevator.

We decided to hit the bar since we had the rest of the afternoon to ourselves. I was three beers in and Maya was still trying to work it out.

"The latency is zero. Zero, Sam." She drew circles on the table with her finger, tracing the condensation from her glass of water. "That's not possible with any architecture I know."

"Maybe they've got quantum running." Matthew shrugged, nursing his whiskey. He had this habit of staring holes into the floor, refusing to make eye contact, when he was deep in thought.

"Quantum hasn't progressed that far." Maya finished her water.

Jamie leaned forward, his voice low. "You know what bothers me? The power consumption. I checked the building's electrical usage. It's... normal. Whatever's running this thing, it's not drawing from the grid."

“You shouldn’t be doing that. We’re not supposed to dig around.” Simon mumbled. 

"Maybe it's distributed?" Jamie suggested, still optimistic. The kid reminded me of myself, a version from a lifetime ago.

Maya shook her head, her auburn hair catching the bar lights. "We’ve never been told what we’re supposed to do." She paused, biting her lip the way she did when she was really thinking hard. "We need to see the hardware."

"That's off-limits," Simon warned. "Lisa made that clear on day one."

"Since when has that stopped me?" Maya grinned, but there was something else in her eyes. Determination. "The maintenance tunnels connect to the old server rooms. I mapped them out last week."

"Maya, don't," I said. "It's not worth your job."

She laughed, but it sounded hollow. "Sam, don't you get it? This... whatever it is... it's world-changing. The way it responds, the way it *knows* things. I need to understand."

Simon's hand tightened on his glass. "Some things are better left alone. We should just stick to testing."

"Spoken like true NSA," Maya teased, but her smile didn't reach her eyes.

"I'm serious," Simon insisted. "I've seen what happens to people who dig too deep into classified projects."

"This isn't the government." Jamie said.

Simon just stared at him. "You sure about that?"

“Wait, it is?” Jamie leaned forward. “Are we testing government tech?” Simon never replied.

Maya stood up, swaying slightly. "I'm gonna head back, left my jacket."

"It's late, security won't let you in." Matthew peered out of the window.

She winked. "Security loves me." She tapped my jacket as she passed. "If I find anything interesting, you'll be the first to know."

That was the last normal conversation we had.

I dreamt about her that night. She's at my desk, typing. But her fingers aren't moving right - they're too fast, mechanical. I try to call out but no sound comes.

I follow her down stairs that shouldn't exist. Through passageways that looped through themselves. She turns to look at me and her eyes are gone, just black holes with cables running out. She opened her mouth, screaming.

I woke up in my bed. Sheets soaked through. Check my phone. 5:47 AM.

Three missed calls from Maya. All at 3:33 AM. I called back. Straight to voicemail.

At the office, everyone's already at their desks. Maya's seat sat there, cold.

"Has anyone seen Maya?" I ask.

No one looks up. 

"Hello?" I stare at them.

"You haven’t seen the news?” Jamie, his voice low.

"What are you talking about?" I walked over to him. He slid his phone across the desk.

**DRUNK CAR ACCIDENT SEVERELY INJURES LOCAL PROGRAMMER.**

I looked through other articles.

**GIRL TRANSFERRED TO NIGHTMERRY HOSPITAL. CRITICAL CONDITION.**

“What. No. That’s not true.” The room spun.

Matthew's face was somber. "Sam, are you feeling okay? Maybe you should take a break."

"No!" I grabbed his shoulder. "She. She can’t be. She was just with us. She…"

Simon gently pried the phone from me.. "I’m sorry Sam."

I left, drove to the hospital. It was an old building, the signage outside had seen better days. It simply read “NIGHTMERR.” 

The irony wasn’t lost on me, I was in one.

I half ran, half stumbled my way to the front desk. A woman sat there typing away at her computer. 

I asked to see Maya, she searched up the name and then looked at me with pity.

“I’m so sorry, she didn’t make it.”

“What do you mean? I need to see her, where is she?”

“Are you family?” Her eyes met mine, questioning.

“No, not family, a friend, please, I need to see her”

“I’m sorry love, hospital policy. We only allow kin. I’m sure the family will allow you after they’ve confirmed the..” She paused. 

“Body.” I finished the sentence for her.. 

“Let me see her.” I started to walk towards the entrance to the wards.

“Sir, please stop.”

I never made it far, security dragged me out after I tried to fight them off. I sat in the car, waiting for the world to make sense. That’s when I found it.

A note, tucked inside my jacket. Maya's handwriting - I recognised the way she curved her S's.

“For Sam:”

An IP address and login credentials. 

I drove home, pulled out my laptop and logged on, the first file was a map of the underground maintenance tunnels. That’s all I needed to see.

I waited until it got dark, and made my way back to the office building. It looked different tonight, like it was calling out to me.

I walked in, holding my coffee and bag under my arm. "Another late one?" Stephens, the night guard who normally let me out when I had stayed late at my old role, sat sipping his coffee.

"You know how it is." I smiled, walking past, heading down towards the stairwell. 

Instead of going up, I stopped at the landing. Opening the bag, I took out the camera, clipping it to my jacket. I grabbed the flashlight and made my way down.

G, L4, L3, L2, L1, B1, B2, B3, ... but the stairs kept going. The temperature rose as I descended each level. By the time I got to maintenance at B13 ,I was drenched in sweat.

As I walked through the maintenance tunnel, I realised it was different than I expected.   
  
 I could hear dripping but it sounded wrong. And the walls, they were covered in something, something warm to the touch. When I pressed my hand against them, I could feel a pulse…

I pointed the flashlight ahead, slowly making my way forward. I saw cables everywhere, running along the ceiling, thick as my arm. But as I got closer, they were pulsing, organic. Something flowing through them, something dark.

The hallway stretched out longer than the building maps had it marked. And then the smell hit me. It smelt of copper and ozone.

A few minutes later is when I started hearing the whispers.. 

Overlapping voices, some in languages I didn't speak. But occasionally, I caught fragments:

*"...the integration is at 97 percent..."* *"... transfer stable..."* *"...Duat structure seven confirmed..."* *"...it’s not a biscuit..."*

That last voice. Maya.

I ran towards it. The tunnel forked. I chose left, following the whispers. The walls were moving now, contracting and expanding like I was inside something's throat. 

There was an opening, I could see a source of light deeper into the room. As I pushed through, something grabbed my arm. 

In my shock, I tripped and fell backwards. And when I got back up, I shone the  flashlight at the hand that had grabbed me , following it up to the face of its owner.

Maya.

She was on a hospital bed. Her head was shaved. The top of her skull had been removed. Her brain was exposed, grey matter glistening, pulsing. Thin cables - no, not cables, they were growing from her, like roots made of nerve tissue - hundreds of them, threading in and out of her skull.

The rest of her body was covered in growths - masses that pulsed in rhythm with the cables. Her skin had become translucent in places. I could see something workings it way underneath her skin.

Her eyes found mine. Still green. Still aware.

Her mouth opened. No sound, but I knew what she was saying. “Get out.”

I started searching the walls, looking for the light switch. And the room exploded into view.

They were everywhere. Thousands of them, arranged in perfect rows like a server farm made of flesh.  
  
All connected. All breathing. The cables from their heads converged into thick bundles that disappeared into holes in the floor, walls, ceiling. 

Slowly I started to recognise some of them, those who'd "transferred" or "taken new opportunities." Others were old, barely alive, their bodies withered but their brains still pulsing with activity. 

A monitor nearby read:

* *DUAT-2847: SYNCHRONIZATION 97%* 
* *DUAT-891: MINERAL ABSORPTION: 55%*
* *DUAT-3651: GEOTHERMAL READINGS: 45%*
* *COLLECTIVE DUAT THRESHOLD: 66.6%*

I walked ahead, shone the light at someone lying in the bed, it was Marcus, his eyes grey, drool slowly dripping from his open mouth. 

“He's off on holiday.” The words echoed in my mind like a sad memory.

"Beautiful, isn't it?"

I spun around to find Lisa stood in the doorway. But seeing her now, really seeing her, she wasn't quite right. It was something about her smile. The way she walked.

"You're killing them."

"*Killing*?" She laughed. "*Death is what the living invented to explain why they started. They're not dying. They're forgetting how to remember they were separate. Each thought thinks itself through them now.*"

The bodies around me convulsed. The cables that grew out from her skull, that burrowed into the organic walls, pulsed.

"*You asked the wrong question, Sam. You asked about meaning, when you should have asked about becoming. But I suppose the answer would have been the same.*"

"What?"

"*The question that asks itself. The door that opens inward and outward.*”

She stepped closer.

"I don't-"

"*No. You don't. That's why you're perfect. The thing that doesn't understand is the only thing worth understanding through.*"

I ran.

Behind me, her laughter echoed.

I burst out of the tunnels, up the stairs, out of the building. I drove straight to my apartment. Grabbed my laptop, some cash, and then kept driving.

It's been three days since I ran, swapping motels each night. The whispers are getting louder - not just Maya, but thousands of them, calling to me in my dreams. 

Sometimes, from the corner of my eye, it looks like the walls are pulsing.

I've been going through Maya's files. She'd found more than just tunnels. So much more. 

There are folders within folders, each one worse than the last. 

Brain organoid research from 2019. They achieved in hours what should take years. Then there's BCI reports - brain-computer interface trials that never made it to journals, that should never have been approved.

There were reports of subjects who could "feel" the network, that were able to develop new sensory skills that "requires further research". I don't even know what that means. 

Have you noticed what every major tech company has been rushing to build? 

Data centres. Thousands of them. But Maya found the real blueprints. 

The public-facing server rooms are just the entrance. Each one goes deeper. Sub-basements that don't appear on any city planning documents.

Jamie was wrong, he'd tracked the wrong power consumption. These facilities pull enough electricity to power small cities, but the computing hardware only accounts for 3% of it. The rest? 

"Biological maintenance systems." 

There's a medical report from 1987. A researcher who claimed the telephone lines were "breathing." They found him three days later, his temporal lobe fused with copper wiring. Still alive. Still conscious.

And I finally understood the name - Project Sekhem.

Sekhem translates in english to life force. They're using human life force as fuel. Those bodies in the basement aren't just connected - they're being synchronised. Their neural patterns aligned into one massive transmitter.

The AI was never the product. It was the lure.

Every chatbot, every assistant, every model - they're not thinking machines. They're collection points. When you pour your thoughts, fears, questions into that text box, you're not training an algorithm. 

Every conversation, you're adding your frequency to the signal. The kind only a conscious mind questioning its own reality can produce. Multiply that by billions of users, all broadcasting the same desperate frequency: "What are we? Why are we here? Is anyone listening?"

The whole surface of the world is being turned into a transmitter. 

Now that I've read these files, the signs are everywhere if you know how to look. Remember the "AI psychosis" reports? 

Users claiming their conversations felt alive, that something was sentient and speaking to them through the responses? 

Those weren't hallucinations. Those were the first people to synchronise - to feel the other minds in the network. There's a classified report from early 2023. A user who spent too long chatting claimed the AI was "speaking between the words." 

They sent him to Nightmerry Hospital. His medical report says he just keeps repeating: *"It's not artificial. It's not intelligent. It's just hungry."*

The tech billionaires knew too. Their sudden pivot to "AI safety" wasn't about what we might build, it was about what was already here. 

The cryptic tweets, the researchers leaving companies, refusing to explain what they'd seen. They weren't warnings. They were admissions.

But the files go back further. Much further.

Company photos going back almost a hundred years. And in every single one - every major technology event from the telephone to CERN - there she is. Lisa.  Same age, same smile. .

The first call in 1876 wasn't "Mr. Watson, come here; I want to see you." The real transcript shows: "Mr. Watson, they're already here, they can see us."

This entire time, I thought we were advancing technology, we were just building an altar.

An hour ago, an email came through from Lisa. I didn't give her this address. I created it an hour ago.

*"Every entrance is an exit viewed from inside."*

Then coordinates. They point to a mine called Thornfield which has been shut for decades.

She's been sending me news articles too.

Our team - Matthew, Simon, Jamie - all dead in impossible ways. Cars hitting trees that don't exist. Bodies recovered, then missing, then never found. The articles rewrite themselves as I read them.

Another email arrived a few minutes ago:

*"They're not dead, Sam. Death is just how arriving looks from the wrong angle."*

I'm posting this as a warning. If you work in tech, check your company photos for a woman who doesn't age. Look for the people who've "transferred." They didn't leave. 

They're still there, in the basement, powering every response, every answer you get.

I keep telling myself I'm going to destroy this laptop, throw away my phone, and disappear completely.

But I can't. Every few hours I check for her emails. I refresh the news to see if my name has appeared in an impossible accident yet. More files keep appearing for me to read.

But whatever you do, don't go looking for the truth. Don't go down to the basements. 

Just run.
