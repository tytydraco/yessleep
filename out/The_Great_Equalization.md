This story, like all of us, is impermanent. It is doomed to disappear with the rest of the virtual archives, vanishing from the physical world along with the data garble that encapsulates the internet. All of the selfies, cat memes, and tweets piled together in the same shit bucket to rot as the news articles and Wikipedia entries we hold dear. 

  
None of it mattering in the end.

  
And I'm okay with that. It’s fine. I sure as hell never wrote this to be some sort of idolized historical document. Take this as one man's account of the aftermath. Scattered ramblings, highly illogical, maybe incoherent at times, but above all else, real. 

  
And that’s more than I can say about a lot of the shit bucket.

  
 Many of us have already come forward with our stories and I expect more will surface in due time. 

   
In the beginning, a lot of us kept it to ourselves. Those who were brave enough (or stupid enough) to share it with a confidant were shell-shocked when they discovered that they had had the same experience. It wasn’t everyone, but there was enough of us to make it a talking point in the evening news. I just wish I had spoken up sooner because maybe we could have been more prepared. Maybe more would have listened.  

  
My wife, Julie, was a secretary for an important politician.  She was often on the road campaigning. I was a handyman with a nagging back. I picked up odd jobs here and there, but I mainly cared for our son, Mason, who, bless his heart, was undiagnosed, but likely somewhere on the spectrum.

  
We were regular people who never really thought about the big picture. I think it’s hard to care about the macro when you're trying to put food on the table. I, like many others, kept my head down. I worked and went to bed obsessing about the regular trivial bullshit that always seemed to plague my mind at night. *Did I pay those outstanding bills? Did I finish all those chores? Is my kid going to be okay? Was I really going bald or did my barber just do me dirty?* 

  
Of course, once I found out, every one of those thoughts disappeared. There was less than a week to prepare. 

  
The message was more of a vision, or rather, a twisted nightmare. I awoke with a splitting headache, my pajamas damp and clinging to my body. Mason was crying in the other room. I tried my best to calm him down while attempting to rationalize my experience.

  
*Restoration. 10.30.2023*. The voice was far too calm, ominious.

  
It took a couple of days for the first news outlet to run the story. It was hastily thrown together with surreal witness accounts and a number to call to share your story. They had coined it: The Great Equalization. Vague. Subtle. Somewhat cold. It was a play on the earth returning to how it was.

   
But the practical folk were calling it what it really was: the end of the world. 

  
The witnesses' detailed accounts had left me frozen. What they had seen in their dreams, with eerie pinpoint accuracy, matched every detail that I could recall from my own. *Could this really be a coincidence?*  And still, I don’t know why, but I never picked up the phone. I think part of me hated that I believed it, and wanted to protect my ego from the almost certain ridicule. 

  
 It wasn’t until the following day when the story was run nationally that I began to really freak out. I begged Julie to come home, and with some out-of-character, high-pitched panicking, she obliged. 

  
Many skeptics laughed at the pandemonium. Maybe you were one of them? Their numbers vastly outnumbered the believers, at least at first. But as the week began to draw down and the news networks pumped the juicy story, the numbers seemed to level out. The streets around my neighborhood began to feel quiet like we were amid an unspoken lockdown, nervously anticipating the end. In those final hours, it was near impossible to find supplies— survival gear or any form of packaged sustenance. Many must have held on to hope, thinking they would make it out alive.

  
Much of the wealthy spent what they could on protection. Their yachts and their mansions became armored fortresses. Even if they didn’t truly believe, why wouldn’t they put themselves in the best position possible? If what they were saying was true, the commas in their bank accounts would mean nothing anyway.

  
The bottom rung of society remained as it always had–vulnerable. What did it matter to them, anyway? They kept on scraping together what they could, getting by as they would have.

  
None of it mattered. The world was about to become equalized, *restored*, as the voice had beckoned. 

  
We counted down the hours for the unknown to be revealed. We waited for that sudden cloud of immeasurable black that smothered the midday sky, the devastating explosion that rattled the ears until the ringing faded away, only to be replaced by something much worse—deafening silence. The multiple impacts that were due to crash into the earth, creating fissures and colossal canyons that stretched across the concrete freeways. Magma cascaded into the air in pillars of flames. Those that somehow managed to survive the initial impacts were led into the pits. Mysterious waves of people emerged from the smoldering rock and began to corral the survivors like cattle, leading them step by step into the fiery unknown. 

  
We waited for all of it. And none of it came.

  
I awoke to Julie still clutching my midriff and Mason nestled between us in a warm-bodied cocoon. Utter relief, considering all of the build-up that had occurred.

  
Experts worked early to try to explain the visions. Many have claimed it was mass hysteria at an unfathomable scale, and that more research was to be conducted.

  
Like Y2K and the Mayan Apocalypse of 2012, our “day of reckoning” never came. The Great Equalization was already being labeled as a hoax, the eyewitnesses “crisis actors”.

  
But if you ask me what I *really* think, I think that’s what *they* want you to believe. 

  
It’s more of a feeling, really. Something just feels off. 

  
Julie has been very quiet this morning. She’s smiling, but she’s barely playing with our son. I watched her do her makeup in the mirror, as I do every morning, and it looks completely wrong. It’s nearly laughable. She looked about as lost as I would.  

  
Maybe I’m being paranoid. These are little things, I get it. But I’ve managed to take the dog out for a walk and head to the corner store, and I recognize it in a lot of them. The grey tint. The slightest bulge of the eyes.   

  
I think what these rock people have done is clever. They’ve lifted the veil on something so fantastical that it could never be perceived as real. They tested the waters to see our reaction. But it was all too obvious. Too grandiose. 

  
This wasn’t a trick or some hoax. 

  
It was an announcement that *they’re* here.
