Every school day is hell. The other kids relentlessly bully me - one of their favorite games is to throw banana peels while shouting "Simran simian! Simran simian!" The teachers just ignore it. They don't treat me much better on account of all my "learning disabilities" and "attitude problems." They would join in with the kids if they could.   


Things aren't much better at home. My parents berate me daily for my shit grades and even shittier attitude. "Why can't you be like your cousins, idiot?" "Simran, if you get held back again, I'm going to send you to live with your relatives in India." "Why don't you just try harder dummy? And would it kill you to smile sometimes? We provide you with a roof and food to eat - be happy damnit."  


But neither my home life nor my school life compare to the horrors I experience in my dreams. Every evening I dread falling asleep. I would rather be tormented by my family and school bullies all through the night than face my nightmares - at least then, I would be able to rest.   


Sometimes, the world I find myself in is close to what we have on Earth - but subtly different. Most often, it is unnatural. I am usually a silent observer. An insignificant detail in the landscape bearing witness as great titans and otherworldly beings conduct their daily rituals.   


Each experience is different, but I'll try and relate some of them here. Maybe it can help me process, at least the stuff that wasn't so horrible that my psyche decided the memories are best left untouched. After all, who remembers most of their dreams?    


\-----------------------------------------------------------------


As I plunge into the nightmare, I'm gasping for breath in an alien landscape. Each inhale feels labored; I choke on the exhales. Upon a vast, purple and pink sandy expanse against an aquamarine sky, I see a procession of creatures marching in orderly lines - hundreds of them like trails of ants. It is difficult to explain the creatures. They look like insects infected with flowering cacti, covered in spines, spikes, and colorful petal-like protrusions. Some resemble flies, while others ran the gamut from earwigs to centipedes. All are in full bloom, and all are buzzing in unison. The song haunts me and pierces my soul, like a chittering Gregorian chant.  


As they walk, they toss sand collected on their body hairs and raise their appendages to the sky, as if in praise. I cannot see where they are marching from my current vantage, so I creep along beside one of the lines - nobody spares me a second glance. As I proceed forward, I notice one group breaking free from the steady march and dashing over the ridge. The group all appear to be wearing metallic adornments and possess swollen body parts. Curious, I decide to follow them.   


Once I crest the ridge, I realize why they are swollen. The pregnant creatures all gather in a massive circle around the outer rim of a great hole in the ground. Staring at the abyss makes me feel like I am peering into the gaping maw of a giant sand beast. It does not bother the creatures, as they scream in pain and ecstasy while laying eggs right along the edge. There are hundreds of thousands of translucent, coppery iridescent eggs. More are continuously being laid. I can see eyes poking through the casings of many of them; the grubs inside all writhe and undulate to the beat of the chanted buzzing.   


As I watch, the pace quickens - more and more pregnant mothers with swollen thoraxes approach the area around the hole and lay eggs wherever they can fit. The eggs clump together and to the sand with a sticky blue secretion excreted by the mothers from their mouths - they rub the slimy goo over the eggs before placing them. Meanwhile, the other creatures begin to arrange themselves in circular tiers and shapes outside the birthing ring. I imagine from the air it would resemble a giant mandala.   


One group of especially large creatures steps forth. They are at least one and a half stories tall and wearing full metal coverage, like armor. They do not have any plantlike parts, and in fact possess reptilian features like scales and forked tongues in addition to their insect-like appendages and wings. The largest among them makes a short, hissing speech, then lifts a spear-like object into the air. As the rhythmic chanting reaches a frenzy, he strikes with all his might. The tip of the object hits the sand, and it ignites in a glorious display of green sparks and white flames.   


He walks over to the clutch of eggs and with great intention and ceremony, lowers the flame. Immediately, a giant circle of neon-colored flames erupts over the entire clutch. With the raging flames reflecting across their many-lensed eyes, the mothers wail and cry big gloopy tears. The rest just watch as the flames devour the eggs.   


The intense heat makes some of the egg sacs pop and expel gooey, half-formed organisms. I hear the sizzling of the flames, the pops and squishes of exploding eggs, and smell the scent of burning fat. The fire forces some of the more developed grubs out of the egg casings. They squeal and cry in high pitched, ringing tones. They don't make it very far - crawling until either they catch fire or the heat cooks and dehydrates them.   


While watching the babies burn, I notice a deep, low rumbling coming from beneath my feet. Now the procession has stopped marching. They continue earnestly, fervently chanting while concentrating on the hole, their appendages raised high toward the sky. I dread what is to come.   


\-------------------------------------------------------------------  


With the sound of a crashing tidal wave, a writhing mass of silver, black, and blue scales emerges from the hole. The chanting has crescendoed to a peak - the praying masses shake in excitement as their god graces them with its mighty presence. It is a multi-headed being; worse than any hydra imagined in myth, with heads resembling loathsome viperfish, wriggling moray eels, many-toothed great white sharks, spiny lionfish, and flared frills wafting, shifting the sand around it with great gusts. It lets out a guttural roar -  so deep that I do not hear it with my ears but instead feel it reverberate throughout my whole body. It causes my belly to ache and my sense of balance to be lost.   


As I fall to my knees, I notice the creatures are doing the same. As they drop, they try their best to keep their arms and upper appendages raised high in prayer. They extend great effort to do this. The chanting in unison has also stopped. It seems each creature is praying their own unique litanies now. It doesn't take me long to figure out why. Their god begins to indiscriminately slaughter the gathered creatures.   


Each head extends and snatches up the awaiting sacrifices - they scream and cry in pain while their bodies get devoured in a bloody, gory mess. The rest of the creatures do not run - they are offerings after all. They stay put and pray harder, hoping beyond hope that they are spared. It's a feeding frenzy as multiple heads work together to rip apart bodies. There is a fine mist of steaming blood in the air and bits of flesh and guts scattered all around the sand.   


I watch the horror unfold deliriously until I feel an intense sensation along my right shoulder. Before I know it, I am thrust high into the air. I feel the whipping wind and sand in my face, then suddenly sharp pain in all directions. I lose awareness of the rest of my body as my limbs are torn to pieces. My head miraculously stays whole. My last sensations are darkness, gagging and choking, crushing sharp teeth, searing acidity, and that horrible roar reverberating and echoing through my skull. After several seconds, I am jolted awake, that horrible roar still ringing throughout my head, paralyzing me in place on my bed with my arms stretched high in prayer. There are grains of purple and pink sand on the hairs on my arms.
