The ticking sound was driving me nuts, but what are you going to do when you’re in an old person's house? The trinkets are everywhere. I picked up the box I had just put down and avoided looking at the painting whose eyes were following me and the cliche stairs that kept creaking every time I walked on a particular one. I was doing volunteer work helping my older neighbor pack up for her move. Irene, my neighbor was currently sitting out on her patio staring out into the world, I wondered what she was thinking about. Once I put the box where it was supposed to go and was well over my volunteer time, I went out to let her know. “Irene, ”I called, "I'm going to head out, let me know if you need anything else before I leave!” No you’re good to leave, she called out in a sweet voice. “Sounds good, I’ll see you tomorrow!” 

I kept hearing that ticking sound and wanted to go see what it was before I left and where it was coming from. Not only because it was driving me nuts and I don’t think I could deal with it tomorrow too, but because I wondered if it was bugging Irene. I passed the wandering eyes of the picture of a sad-looking woman and wandered into a room where it sounded like the noise was coming from. I heard it, but couldn’t find the source. Maybe I was just hearing things, or it was just this old house. I decided to give up on the noise and head out. “What are you doing?” A voice of a young woman called out to me. I refused to turn around because I knew Irene and I were the only ones in here. 

The woman's face was pale and cruel and matching nothing of her sweet voice. Her long black hair was stringy and her clothes looked as if they were burnt. She was staring right at me and I realized for a second in my fear she looked familiar. She was the sad-looking woman who followed me everywhere. I couldn’t believe I was about to answer her when I said, “I was looking for the source of this noise I kept hearing. ”She blinked at me and told me not to worry about the noise, but continued to block the door. I had so many questions I wanted to ask, but considering it was more than not a dead woman telling me not to worry I needed to get out of here. 

I moved my feet and for some reason that gave me the confidence to move the rest of my body. “I’ve been watching you, it’s kind of you to help out here. ”I could move my body, but no words came out of my mouth. “Eva, are you still here?” The woman blocking the door gave me a look that told me to keep my mouth shut. It wouldn’t have mattered if I could open my mouth anyways. “Who are you?” I finally got out. I live here, she looked me dead in the eyes when she said this. “I’ve never seen you before; Irene is the only one who lives here.” “That’s not true, and you know it. How many times did you see the curtain move when Irene was out on her patio?” I thought about it, she wasn’t wrong; I had seen a curtain move plenty of times when I knew Irene was out on the patio. I figured it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, or Irene had left a window open. Turns out it was neither. 

Interrupting my thoughts, she said, “she can’t see me, only you can.” I wanted to ask her why she’s here and why she’s haunting this place. But she answered it for me before I could even get the words out. “I’ve been stuck upstairs for over 40 years and can’t escape. “Irene’s tried to take my portrait down, but no one can take it down, not even me. So you just haunt the upstairs? She simply said,“Yes. “Does it also have anything to do with that ticking noise? She tilted her head to the side and laughed, “probably”. I was going to get out of here, even if that meant I had to be face to face with a ghost. She let me pass without even a fight and looked over her shoulder, “See you tomorrow.” 

See you tomorrow?! As if I would be going back there, but I couldn’t let Irene down, so I guess I would be back. The next day, I braced myself for what I was going to see and hear, but of course, Irene told me there were more boxes upstairs for me to grab. I acted as if nothing was wrong with me going upstairs and tried not to stare at that horrible painting. I could still hear the ticking sound, but didn’t see that woman anywhere. Up and down the stairs I went without seeing her at all. “Irene, when you go upstairs do you ever hear a ticking sound by chance?” She looked at me like I was crazy, but answered "of course it’s probably coming from the piano room!” I turned to go, but the old woman stopped me and said, “all the boxes are where they’re supposed to be but there’s one more thing. ”

I wasn’t a religious person, but at that moment I prayed to whoever was listening that she wasn’t about to say what I thought. The picture frame on the wall needs to come down as well. It wasn’t even mine to begin with, but it’s just so beautiful I just can’t imagine leaving it. I stood there at the top of the stairs staring at the painting, the one that’s been following me this whole week. Part of me wishes I knew the muse for it was real; then I wouldn’t have given it the evil eye this whole time. Beautiful isn’t it, that sweet song voice said. I looked at the painting and then I looked at the woman standing before me. I knew she was a ghost, but I wanted to know her story. I wanted to know why she’s been haunting this old woman upstairs. The next thing I knew was she was telling me everything. 

There was a fire, started in the kitchen and eventually made its way upstairs where she was in the piano room. The door got stuck and she couldn’t get out, but everyone else did. She stayed there and watched as everything burned around her, her family could do nothing. The fire department was too late. So she’s stuck here with the ticking of the metronome, along with the painting the only things that shows she’s here. I asked her why no one can take the painting off the wall though and she simply answered “my soul keeps it in place.” I told Irene the painting can’t come off the wall and she shrugged saying I guess you just can’t take everything.” It was here when I moved in so I guess it’ll be ready for the next person who moves in. I nodded at her knowing the next person is going to also have a haunted upstairs. I turned to leave when Irene stopped me and said, “did you ever figure out what that ticking sound might be?”

 I was shocked she even heard it, but I shook my head back and forth. “No, the one thing I never got to the bottom off when cleaning.” No worries,” she said as she brushed it off, “It’s like white noise to me now, anyways.” I hugged her goodbye wishing her well on her new journey. As I walked past the stairs I looked up subtly to see that the painting followed me once more. On my way out the door I passed by a mirror only to notice a new portrait had been hung up by the door, one that I did recognize. I turned around only to notice the sad-looking woman watching me, “welcome home”, she said.
