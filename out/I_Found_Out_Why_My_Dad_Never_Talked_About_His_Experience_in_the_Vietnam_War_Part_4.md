In the palpable tension that fills the cramped space of the hut, I lean in close to Tuyết, my voice a whisper. "I have an idea, but we need to act fast."

I explain my risky plan to her. With a solemn nod, she positions herself by the doorway of the hut.

Tuyết takes a deep breath, then shouts towards the door, her voice cracking with feigned helplessness. "Đừng bắn! Em ra đây!" (Don't shoot! I'm coming out!)

The soldiers outside respond with a barrage of taunts and obscenities, their voices laced with cruelty and anticipation. "Come out, sweetie! Let's see if you're as pretty as you sound!" one jeers, his laughter harsh and mocking.

"Yeah, come show us a good time!" another chimes in, his tone dripping with malice. “We won't bite... hard!"

“Anh yêu em!” (I love you!) a third commando shouts in broken Vietnamese, giving smoochies.

Ignoring their taunts, I grab hold of Mrs. Thảo's bindings, guiding her twisted form to face the door. I struggle to hold onto her as she grows more agitated, sensing her impending release.

Tuyết, her back against the wall, carefully unlatches the door, keeping her body out of the soldiers' line of sight. The door creaks open a sliver, a thin beam of sunlight piercing the gloom of the hut.

As the door swings open, the air crackles with tension, a moment frozen in time. The  commandos’ eyes widen in shock as they catch sight of Mrs. Thao.

“Oh, fu—” one manages to utter.

I slacken my grip on Mrs. Thảo. She lunges forward with a guttural roar, her charred form a blur of rage and hunger. Her teeth sink into the nearest commando’s neck with a vicious ferocity, tearing through flesh and arteries. Blood spurts in a gruesome fountain, painting the air crimson as he collapses, his cries gurgling into silence.

In the split second of shock that follows the savage attack, Tuyết and I seize the moment. We step forward, rifles raised, opening fire on the stunned soldiers.

The soldiers at the doorway are quickly neutralized under our rapid fire, their bodies slumping to the ground.

We press on, using Mrs. Thao’s convulsing body as a shield. The sensation of bullets thudding into her is unnerving.

The sudden eruption of violence transforms the scene into one of chaotic carnage. Bullets whiz past, finding targets in flesh and wood alike.

We move grimly, our weapons spitting death at the unwitting soldiers. The enemy, recovering from their initial shock, returns fire with disciplined volleys.

The villagers, caught in the deadly crossfire, scramble for cover. A young man, barely out of his teens, falls clutching his chest, his eyes wide with disbelief. A mother, her arms shielding her children, darts behind a crumbling wall, her prayers whispered between breaths.

We're outnumbered and outgunned, a fact that becomes more apparent with each passing second. Tuyết's face is a mask of determination, but I can see the fear in her eyes. We duck behind a fallen cart, its wood splintered by bullets, offering scant protection.

"I'll cover you, move to that building there!" I shout to Tuyết, indicating a partially destroyed hut across the way. Her nod is terse, her movements swift as she darts forward under the cover of my gunfire.

The firefight intensifies, the enemy's fire becoming more concentrated. Bullets chip away at my fragile cover, sending splinters flying. My magazine runs dry, and I slam in a new one, the click of the magazine home a comforting sound.

As Tuyết reaches the relative safety of the hut, she turns and lays down covering fire for me. I make a break for it, sprinting with a speed I didn't know I possessed. Bullets kick up dirt around my feet, a terrifying reminder of how close death is.

Reaching the hut, I dive through the doorway, rolling to a stop beside Tuyết.

Our respite is fleeting, the illusion of safety shattered as the rhythmic throb of the Huey's rotors grows louder, more insistent. Through the shattered window of the hut, we see the helicopter pivot in the air, its deadly armament aligning with our precarious shelter. The sight of Major Wolff, perched menacingly in the passenger seat, his cold smile chills my blood. His hand motions commandingly, a silent order to his gunner.

Huey's minigun swivels towards us, its barrels glinting ominously in the sun. Time slows, each millisecond stretching into eternity as we brace for the storm of bullets.

But then, the air is split by a different sound—a sharp, piercing whoosh that cuts through the din of battle. A rocket, a thin trail of smoke in its wake, streaks through the air with lethal precision. The Huey, caught off-guard, attempts a desperate evasive maneuver. Too late. The rocket connects with a thunderous impact, engulfing the helicopter in a ball of fire and smoke. Debris scatters, raining down on the battlefield like a deadly hail.

In the stunned silence that follows, I turn towards the source of our salvation. There, standing with the spent tube of an M72 LAW slung over his shoulder, is Specialist Văn, one of my squadmates. His uniform is torn and stained with blood and soot.

As I grapple with the shock and relief of seeing him alive, two more figures emerge from the smoke and rubble, weapons at the ready. They're members of my squad, Private First Class Lâm and Private Hùng, both of whom I had feared lost.

Lâm, his face smeared with grime and blood, brandishes an M79 grenade launcher. Hùng, carrying an extra bandolier of ammunition, moves with a limping gait, evidence of a wound not fully healed. Their arrival turns the tide of the firefight, bolstering our numbers and morale.

Without wasting a moment, we coordinate our assault. Lam positions himself behind a shattered wall, peering through a gap to aim his M79. With a steady hand, he fires, the grenade launcher's distinct thump echoing through the village. The 40mm grenade arcs gracefully before detonating amidst a group of commandos attempting to flank us. The explosion sends shrapnel tearing through the ranks of attackers. Horrific screams follow.

The battlefield becomes a blur of motion and violence. Hùng unleashes a torrent of gunfire from his M60, the belt-fed rounds chattering rapidly as he lays down a blanket of suppressing fire. The commandos, caught in the open, scramble for cover behind a fallen water buffalo, its massive body a grotesque shield against our onslaught. Bullets tear through the decaying flesh, sending tufts of fur and a spray of gore into the air.

I signal to the others, our eyes meeting with a shared understanding. We split, moving in a coordinated effort to encircle the commandos.

As we advance, Lâm takes point on one flank, moving with a silent grace. He spots a commando attempting to reposition. The enemy soldier, unaware of Lâm's approach, is caught off-guard as Lâm closes the distance between them.

The confrontation is sudden and brutal. Lâm confronts the commando at close range. The commando, surprised, tries to bring his weapon to bear, but it's too late. Lâm's remington shotgun roars with a deafening blast. The soldier is hit square in the chest, the impact throwing him backward, his life extinguished before he hits the ground. Lâm doesn't pause to watch; he's already moving, scanning for the next threat.

As Tuyết and I inch closer, the sound of our adversaries' panicked whispers reaches our ears. They huddled behind the buffalo’s corpse, unaware of our approach, their attention focused on the direction of Lâm's last known position.

We communicate with a series of hand signals, a silent agreement to converge on the enemy from opposite sides. Tuyết nods, her eyes locked on mine for a moment, a shared resolve between us. She circles to the left, moving with a predator's stealth, her SKS cradled in her arms.

I take the right flank, my steps deliberate, avoiding the debris that litters the ground. The scent of blood and decay is overwhelming as I draw closer to the buffalo, its bloated body a grim barrier.

Reaching the edge of the makeshift cover, I pause, listening. The commandos' ragged breathing is audible now. I glance towards Tuyết, finding her position. She's ready, her presence barely noticeable in the chaos around us.

Tuyết edges closer, her movements a silent whisper. The commandos, too focused on their immediate front, fail to notice her approach. With the precision of a seasoned hunter, she aligns her sights on one, his head barely peeking above their dubious cover. In a heartbeat, her finger tightens on the trigger of her rifle. A shot rings out. The commando's head snaps back, his body going limp as he slumps to the ground, a life extinguished in the blink of an eye.

The remaining commando, sensing the tide turning against him, makes a desperate move. He stands abruptly, revealing his last, despicable card: Tuyet’s niece, Mai, clutched in his arms, used as a human shield. The child's tears streak through the dirt on her face, her sobs piercing the post-battle silence.

"Get the fuck back!" the commando barks.

“Aunt Tuyet!” Mai cries.

Tuyết freezes, her rifle lowering slightly. "Don’t worry, baby," she calls out gently to Mai. “Everything’s going to be okay.”

Her eyes are fixed on the girl, her posture softened by the instinct to protect the innocent. The commando's desperate grip on the child only tightens, his eyes darting wildly, searching for an escape that doesn't exist.

At that moment, everything slows down. The American’s back is turned to me, his focus entirely on Tuyết and Mai. It's now or never.

I inch forward, my movements barely a whisper. The commando's M16 shakes in his grip, betraying his fear and desperation.

As I draw near, his voice cracks, "I'll do it! I swear I'll—"

Tuyết keeps her rifle lowered, her hands spread in a gesture of surrender, her eyes locked on Mai, offering silent reassurance. She's playing her role perfectly, giving our opponent a false sense of security.

I'm close now, close enough to hear the ragged edge of fear in the commando's breath, to see the sweat bead on his brow, the tremble of his hold. The final steps I take are the quietest.

With a surge of adrenaline, I swing the rifle down with all my might. The butt of the rifle connects with the commando's skull with a sickening crack, a sound that echoes sharply in the sudden silence. The force of the blow sends him stumbling forward, releasing his grip on the girl.

The commando collapses to the ground, motionless, a crumpled heap of fabric and flesh.

Mai, freed from her captor's grasp, runs towards Tuyết, who sweeps her up in her arms, her eyes wide with relief and fear.

Tuyết looks at me, her eyes filled with gratitude. The girl clings to her, his small body shaking with sobs. “You’re okay, baby. I’ve got you,” she whispers to the child.

In the aftermath, the stillness is shattered by the sound of boots crunching on debris. From the smoke, the survivors of my platoon emerge, their weapons trained on Tuyết, the trembling child in her arms.

"Drop the gun now! Step away from the kid!" Lam barks, his shotgun aimed squarely at Tuyết’s head.

Tuyết, her resolve hardening, sets the child gently on the ground behind her and turns to face the soldiers, her posture defiant. Her rifle, though lowered, remains in her grip.

I step forward, placing myself between Tuyết and the survivors of my platoon, my back to her as I face my men. "Stand down!" My voice is firm, leaving no room for argument. "That's an order!"

Their guns waver but don't lower, suspicion etched deep in their faces. Văn's eyes narrow, his grip on his rifle tightening. "Bitch is fucking VC! We can't trust her.”

"Tuyết is with me," I say firmly..

"Thành, what are you doing?" Hung challenges. “You’re on a first name basis with the enemy now?”

“She saved my life,” I exclaim.

“She what?” Hung asks, bewildered.

"And I saved her life," I add, my voice steady but laced with an urgency that I hope conveys the gravity of what Tuyết and I have been through. "We’d be dead without each other. Or worse."

The men's eyes flick between me and Tuyết, their fingers still tense on their triggers. Tuyết stands her ground, her gaze steady and unflinching.

Lâm's voice cuts through the tense silence, "And how many of our men did she kill in the ambush? How can you just stand there and defend her?"

Tuyết's response is a quiet confession, her voice steady despite the weight of her words. "Yes, I fought against you. You were the enemy," she admits, her eyes never leaving Lâm's. "But the threat we face now, it doesn't care about sides. It's killing everyone, soldiers and civilians alike."

Hung, the youngest member of my squad, his face smeared with dirt and streaked with sweat, looks from me to Tuyết and back again. His rifle, previously aimed with unwavering intent, lowers fractionally. "If Thành vouches for you," he says, his voice betraying a flicker of uncertainty, "then... then that's good enough for me."

I can see Lam’s resolve wavering. I meet Lâm's eyes, my expression earnest. "Look around you, Lâm. This isn't about North versus South anymore. What we're facing, it's something else entirely. It doesn't see uniforms or flags; it just destroys."

Lam’s eyes still hold a shadow of doubt, but he nods, acknowledging my command. "I hope you know what you’re doing, Thanh," he mutters, his voice a gruff concession to my authority rather than any trust in Tuyết.

Van remains the last holdout, his stance rigid, his rifle still aimed at Tuyết. "You shitheads are really going to fall for her act?" he growls.

I meet Van's gaze squarely, my voice steady. "It's not an act. You saw her fight beside us. She took down those commandos just as we did."

"One pretty face, and you've all caught a case of stupid,” Van says with contempt. “Have you forgotten what her kind did to Hiep?”

Van's words hit me like a physical blow, the mention of my brother dragging up memories I've fought hard to keep at bay.

I lock eyes with Van. "You think I've forgotten? Every day, I carry that with me. But this... This isn't about revenge. It's about survival."

“Yeah, and I’m going to ensure our survival by blowing her brains out,” he counters.

"You're going to make that little girl watch her aunt get shot?" I press, nodding towards the trembling child now clinging to Tuyết's leg, her small face buried in the fabric of Tuyết's trousers.

“Is that the kind of man you are, Van?” What would your daughter think of her father right now?"

Van's jaw clenches, his gaze shifting between me, Tuyết, and the child. “God damn you, Thanh…”

The standoff stretches on, a moment frozen in time, as Van wrestles with the implications of his actions.

Finally, with a barely audible sigh, Van's stance softens. The tension in his shoulders eases as the rifle lowers, the barrel pointing harmlessly to the ground.

As he moves past me, he leans in close, his breath warm against my ear. "If she betrays us, I’ll shoot both of you myself," Văn says, a challenge and promise woven into his words.

—

The air is filled with the acrid smell of gunpowder, wails, and the metallic tang of blood. Tuyết moves among the surviving villagers, offering comfort and assessing injuries with a gentle efficiency.

Meanwhile, I signal to my men, directing them towards the unconscious commando sprawled on the ground. His body lies motionless. We approach with caution, aware that the enemy, even in defeat, can still pose a danger.

Văn and Hùng secure the commando's arms behind his back, using the remnants of his belt to bind his wrists. As they do, I notice the disturbing trophy that adorns his neck—a necklace made of human ears, their edges frayed and bloodied. A visceral disgust churns in my stomach.

"Fuck," Lam exclaims. "Who would do something like this?"

“A monster, that’s who,” Van says, spitting on the ground.

I take a look at our captive’s face. I’m struck by how young he looks. Barely out of his teens. I can't help but wonder, what series of events led him to this moment? What could compel someone so young to embrace such darkness?

I hold up his dog tags, flipping them over in my hands. The cold metal feels heavy, engraved with the name "Elijah Wright."

I begin to search his pockets, methodical and thorough. Aside from a few crumpled bills and a Zippo lighter, there's little of interest until my fingers close around a small, worn photograph.

Pulling it out, the image that greets me is striking. It’s Wright, his arms wrapped around a Vietnamese woman in an embrace. They're smiling, lost in a moment of joy. It strangely humanizes him.

As we turn our prisoner over to check for concealed weapons, I catch sight of a tattoo on his bicep. It's a macabre image: a smiling skull, blood dripping from its jaws, adorned with a green beret. The letters ‘MACV-SOG’ are etched in bold underneath. It's the name of a shadowy organization I've only heard whispered about in hushed tones.

Rumored to be directly run by the American CIA, their operations are the stuff of ghost stories among the rank and file—missions deep into enemy territory, assassination squads, psychological warfare that know no bounds. The brutality and heartlessness of their actions are nightmare fuel, even among those of us accustomed to the horrors of war.

Staring at the tattoo, the realization dawns on us. This young man isn’t just any soldier; he’s part of something far more sinister, an operative trained to sow terror and death without remorse.
