5/27/2023: dad came home from work today and tossed a pamphlet on the table. me and mom were watching a movie And he started rambling about some random man who tossed it into his open window at a red. Dad, Being the passive guy he is, just rolled up his squeaky Ass window and read it. from his words, he said it’s about “It” and no not the clown. “It” is some sort of entity, and from how dad explained it, whoever mad the pamphlet seems to see it as a god or something. What’s weird, the pamphlet was covered in eyes, but the pointy parts were up and there were hands inside of the pupils. Seems like something you’d draw in a vent sketchbook, but I dunno.

5/28/2023: mom‘s mad at dad again. She said she was getting ready for bed when he tried to get her to read the pamphlet. He said something like “Tina, I know it’s fake, but whoever made it thought it out. It’s kind of cool.” mom clearly didn’t, since they haven’t talked all morning. Dad seems really tired, I think he was up reading that thing for a while.

5/29/2023: well, mom caved. She skimmed through the pamphlet this morning. Just to shut dad up I think, but now she’s sat at the table, reading it over and over. I kind of want to take a glance at it, if it was able to get both sciencey mom and nerd dad invested, it must be good. Well, maybe not. Dad has been acting weird lately, more shut off, sticking to himself more. Its creepy.

6/2/2023: My parents slipped a pamphlet under my door this morning. They have been trying to convince me for too fucking long now to “let It guide me,” whatever the hell that means. I’m flipping though it right now, it’s clearly bullshit. It’s a borderline cult, they want me to follow It. I don’t give a flying fuck what It is. It messed my parents up. I don’t want it. I slid the pamphlet back under the door, now they’re pissed. They don’t sound like themselves. There’s something below their voices. It’s like… well, my mom for example, it’s like her voice is layered on top of itself, but one of the tracks pitch is lower. God damn it I sound crazy. No one is going to believe me, he’ll I don’t even believe it myself. Okay wait what the hell. She just said “your material body is your only prison.” Does she remember who she was? The way she reacted when my dad brought her that fucking pamphlet? The way she laughed? my dad didn’t believe it, but then he did. All the sudden, my mom did. Now I’m next. I won’t believe. I won’t let It guide me. Well, that’s exactly what my mom said. Well, I’m not like her.

6/6/2023: So much has happened, reading this back I’ve missed so much, but I can’t fill it all in. For, what I’ve figured out, “It” is some sort of god, and It’s followers are a sort of cult. It seems to be some sort of eye, or at least it looks like one from what’s drawn all over that pamphlet. My parents, or whatever is left of them, seems to want to “open my eyes.” Ive been in my room for the past four days now. I have enough food to last a while, water too. They leave occasionally, so I could go into the kitchen And grab more. I’m getting really scared. My parents are gone, and I think whatever “It” is, it’s using their bodies. I don’t know for what, but I don’t want to know. Holy fuck they’re banging my door. It been three minutes now, and they haven’t stopped. It’s always the same time apart, around two knocks a second?? Fuck fuck fuck I don’t want them to come in. I don’t know what it is. WHAT THE FUCK. there aren’t any feet under the door. But something is fucking knocking. I hear my dads voice, but that deep static is surrounding it. “Let It in.” im gonna die in here.

6/7/2023: I have made a plan. this very well be my last entry. I’m hoping someone will find this. I am going to go out into the kitchen, I can hear them out there now. I will tell them I want to accept It into my life. There is no way of knowing what they’ll do, but I think it may kill me. I’m so fucking scared, I don’t want to die. I am hiding this in my bookshelf, among the other books and shit. My name is Liliana Twinsen, and I am saying goodbye.

Officers Mark Benton and Willa Floris visited <redacted> on 6/8/23. Neighbors reported hearing screams, then silence, then laughter. Upon entering the house, the officers were greeted with the body of Liliana Twinsen. An eye was carved into the skin of her forehead, and her hands had been cut off. Liliana’s own eyes were open wide, and her body was assembled in a pose resembling what you would see of someone in worship.The bodies of Tina Woods and Chris Twinsen were found with gashes around their eyes, making their eyes appear to be shifted 90 degrees. Upon further inspection, Liliana’s cause of death was ruled as a murder, but the deaths of Tina and Chris are still being inspected. Their eyes were carved before their deaths, but they each died in some sort of struggle.The home was inspected, and the blood of Liliana, Tina, and Chris was found on a knife. Upon inspection of Liliana’s room, a journal was discovered. She seemed to account for her parents sudden shift after reading a pamphlet, along with their shift in behavior after absorbing the cult-like material. It is believed that Liliana was killed by her parents, perhaps as a sacrifice to the entity they worshipped. The journal itself, along with the pamphlet it spoke of, have been seized by our officers.Upon the time of writing this, during inspections of Tina and Chris, tears were found in their lungs. These rips could not have occurred naturally, as they seem to spell out a message.
