I noticed it about a week ago, and I’m completely at my wit’s end!

I’ve been married to my partner for seven years now. We met, fell in love, and wanted to start a family soon after, but somehow, my dream has turned into this nightmare these past few days.

Charlie, my son, was born around six years ago, and I don’t think I’ve ever felt this much love for anything in my life. The first time I held him was the day I swore I would do everything in the world to make his life the best it could be, and I don’t want to brag, but I think my partner and I have done an absolutely fantastic job.

We’ve never argued in front of him, never not shown him love or neglected him, or let him see the normal stress of adult life, even if our own went from bad to worse during the pandemic. What I want to say with that is that no matter what happened, Charlie knew that he would always come first for us.

No nightmare was small enough to not wake us up.

No scrape on his knee is not important enough to not make us check him thoroughly.

No fever was low enough to not make us take notice.

And we did all of that together. Family dinners, movies, even the playground...

Only, since about a week ago, my child has changed, and I don’t know what to do anymore. It started right after I had tucked him in and read him a bedtime story...

“What is pain?” he asked me.

I remember it so clearly, as the question caught me completely off guard. With no idea where it had come from, I felt a chill as I looked down at his almost angelic face and saw this strange twinkle in his eyes.

That was the first time I felt like he had changed somehow.

Of course, I didn’t say anything but tried to answer his question as age-appropriately as possible, but my reply left him visibly unsatisfied.

He was biting at his lips, something he had always done, but on that day, it too felt different. Less... unsure... more... aggressive.

And all the while his eyes continued looking up at me, as I felt this strange chill in the atmosphere of the room.

Of course, I told my wife, but she didn’t seem to react at all.

Well, I managed to talk myself down back then, and the next morning, when we went to the playground as a family, I reasoned that I must have just let my imagination get the better of me.

I guess, if that was the truth, I wouldn’t be writing everything down right now, though.

It was at the playground when I got this strange feeling again. Charlie was running around like normal, I tried to tell myself at first, but soon these doubts crept up once more. I don’t know... I watched him intently, and he kind of seemed... off.

Like, his gait was different. The steps he took looked strange like he tried to move legs that were far shorter than normal. Then there was the way he sometimes stopped with this wide and almost manic grin and looked at each of the children around him in turn...

My wife didn’t seem to notice, but I could feel it. Even if I didn’t want to admit it to myself, somewhere inside I couldn’t shake those suspicions...

Charlie had changed... or was it even my son at that point?

A kid a bit younger than him was sitting on the swing, trying to gain some speed, and I could see the instant my son’s eyes fell upon it. There was this change in his smile. This cruelty that only for a moment showed on his face.

I was up on my feet before he reached the swing set, but my wife grabbed hold of my wrist as if to stop me. I didn’t want to doubt her as well... maybe she was just startled by my sudden movement, I told myself, but her hand held me back anyway.

So I watched as Charlie approached the swing and suddenly grabbed it on the way down, making the girl sitting on there lose her balance and crash to the ground with a loud thud.

The girl cried out, and I remember my son’s grin, hidden from almost everyone as he looked down at her, then let go of the swing.

My wife was over there in an instant while I couldn’t move at all. Thankfully nothing major had happened. The girl had scraped her forehead a bit, and Charlie was adamant that it had been an accident, but I know better. I saw him grab the swing and smile.

We went home quickly after, with my wife almost babying our son, asking him if he had hurt himself over and over again.

I could see it in his eyes. This strange and not even remotely childlike look he had. He was shaking his head at every question but kept staring at the hand he had used to stop the swing. I don’t know... maybe I’m interpreting too much into such a gesture, but I feel like I could see him wondering what else he could have done, and I get shivers even thinking about that.

That night, my wife put him to bed, while I felt completely restless. I was walking around the kitchen, trying to make sense of what I had seen.

Something had changed about my son; that much was obvious. Only, I didn’t know how much. At least not until a few nights ago.

Back then, as I went upstairs and to our bedroom, long after she had put Charlie to bed, I suddenly stopped. I was maybe three steps away from the door to his room, but I thought I could hear him. He wasn’t talking out loud or mumbling but whispering, hissing in there. I felt a chill as I put my ear to the wall to hear him better, but all I could make out were those strange, high-pitched sounds.

Of course, I didn’t just leave him be but opened his door, and the moment I did so, the whispers stopped. He was lying in bed, under his covers, pretending to be asleep.

I know what my son sounds like when he sleeps, but this was not it. There isn’t a single doubt about that in my mind. It felt like he was waiting for me to leave, and being tired, I did so after a few more seconds.

The very next day, when my wife took our son to get a haircut, I snuck the old baby monitor into his room and hid it by his bed... I know what that sounds like, but I promise you, I am and was not crazy. If I hadn’t found anything after that stunt, I was determined to get myself checked up at the hospital, but I did.

That evening I listened in on my wife and son when she put him to bed.

It started off normal at first. She began to tell him a story, but after not even two minutes, he asked her to stop and simply talk with him.

He sounded different. Far too mature... and my wife’s voice almost broke. They chatted about their day as if they were old friends instead of mother and son, but I could hear it every time my wife spoke. She sounded strained and on edge.

It was only then that I realized that she knew as well...

This strange, cold chill seemed to blow through the house as I continued to listen. They didn’t talk about anything out of the norm, but the flow of their conversation just felt completely off. It was almost like Charlie was trying to learn how he should behave around normal humans. He asked her what the hairdresser’s intention had been with a few of his questions. What the other people would have thought of his behavior. Stuff like that.

Part of me wanted to run up there and confront him directly, but hearing my wife answering in this strangely demure tone made me stop and wait.

She sounded scared, almost.

So maybe it had gone on for longer than I thought...

Soon after, my son told her to let him sleep, and I heard my wife walking out of the room and toward our bedroom a few seconds later.

No good-night kiss, no ‘I love you.’

If I ever had any doubts, that alone would have told me all I needed to know.

The problem was, I couldn’t concentrate on that at all. As soon as my wife had left, the mumbling started.

At first, it was almost incoherent, but after a few seconds, I could make out some fragments. It sounded like a prayer. This reverie in his voice made sweat break out all over my body.

He wasn’t speaking in English, no, nor any other language I know of. The words sounded older, rougher. What I can say for sure is that it wasn’t gibberish. His mumbling prayer had a meaning. I could feel it.

It flowed out of him in a continuous stream for a minute until suddenly, he stopped.

I was standing by the counter of the kitchen, staring down at the old baby monitor, then heard his voice, now sounding far too deep for a six-year-old child.

“Stop listening,” he growled, then took a breath. “I do not like being spied on.”

The device in my hand started to blink wildly before smoke came out of its top, and it burst into flames.

I wanted to run away, but I knew I couldn’t.

My wife was still upstairs, but that time, as I snuck up there and past my son’s bedroom, I could hear him... it... chuckling.

Of course, I didn’t dare open the door but ran past toward the room where my wife would be.

My plan was to get her out of there, if it came to it, with force, but the moment I saw her and she saw me, all that bravado left me.

She was sitting on the bed, crying silently as I walked in. There was fear in her eyes. Real, unadulterated terror and panic.

I knew it at that moment. This thing had done something to her.

So I sat down next to her and hugged her without saying a word for a long, long time.

We fell asleep like that, I think because when I woke up, it was from something long and sharp cutting into my cheek.

Next to my side of the bed, I saw Charlie standing and holding a kitchen knife while staring down at me like one would do at an insect.

I wanted to scream for help, but he put one of his fingers over my lips, and I swear, my body seemed to freeze.

Moving a muscle was out of the question, and the knife wandered down toward my throat.

“What is fear?” Charlie whispered in this gruff voice but kept his finger on my lips.

I looked over at my wife, whose eyes were wide as she stared back, unmoving just like me. Trembling and sweating, I could do nothing but lie there and wait for what would happen next.

This... thing... delighted in my terror, and I was sure it would cut me or stab me, but instead, it suddenly pulled the knife away and dropped it to the floor before turning and walking out of our bedroom as if nothing had happened at all.

I tried talking to my wife, but she shook her head and held her hands over her ears the second I mentioned our son.

Is he possessed? Was he always like that but stopped hiding it? Has something else taken his place?

I don’t know anymore.

My wife won’t talk to me about it; she smiles while she trembles from head to toe every time Charlie enters the room.

This morning, we sat at the table, having breakfast in complete silence while he told us what he dreamed about.

I don’t know how long we’re going to last!

We can’t run. My wife’s eyes tell me as much.

I can’t call the police. This thing would simply play dumb.

What else can I do?

Please... just... anything.

Or we might all be dead soon.
