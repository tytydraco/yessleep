In a very few towns, there is a forrest everyone passes everyday. 
Many people dont pay no mind to the sight but others cant help but be intrigued by the amazing and beautiful sight of the wild land scape, though it is beautiful there are some areas and places that should remain unexplored.

Well,.. 

if you ever hear voices coming from the woods, please do not go to investigate. .
many have heard the forrest call out to them, wanting them to come too and embrace what is not there.
Many old native tribes have there own experiences and stories to share about the different forrests but they all have one thing in common,.. the raven.
And one story evolves around a couple that went hiking on trip to the trail that led up into the forrest. but what they didn't know was, it was the ravens forrest.

So a few miles out in the outskirts of town not far from city limits, a couple would always walk or have long jogs as a daily routine and it was good for a small exercise but they were always craving something more..
like something with more depth and more aspiring features in detail to view,
And there are many walkways and long trails all throughout parks but they haven't found any spark of interest, and they where quickly running out of new areas to explore. 
except for one place that they knew...

And this place was very familiar, and they often would jog past the land but never occurred to think of crossing into the Landscape.
it was mostly because nobody was ever hardly seen going into or coming out of the woods so they figured it was private property and didn't want to trespass on anyones private area. 
So, soon they started asking around with the locals and the neighborhood About the location, many claimed they didn't know much about the area except for what was viewable to the eye.

Tho many thought of the same thing the couple were thinking, 
(why is the place so beautiful but so empty most of the time.)
after many questions and random answers they came to a suggestion one offered. Why not go in and see what it is like, so for days they thought on the idea but were too sketchy of it and after some weeks past they decided 
"well a peak wont hurt."
So on a warm sunny day they both set out to seek and admire the forrest for its beauty, when they entered the forrest they suddenly noticed that the land is far more beautiful and bigger than it looks.

They began exploring and taking small brakes to take in the sightings of the areas and as the day went on, the light of the sun begin to vanish out the sky rather quickly and the two noticed and started to make there way out of the forrest before it got too dark.
Though they explored so much of the forrest they forgot one minor/major detail and rule, 
(If you get lost leave a trail of bread crumbs.)
that way you'll find your way home.

So they began to move quicker and started scanning the area for familiar sights and things they recognized...
with no aveil, soon they started to notice the sun fading in the distance and all the sudden, . . the guy. . 
needed to use the bathroom.
And the girl sighed and waved him off to do his business, as the guy went to use the bathroom the girl began to look for any signs of recognition.
She thought she caught glimpse of something she seen along the way and she went forward to make the claim, she soon noticed it was just the same tree they passed three times already as she said "i guess it was familiar but its not a good sign."

While she examined the tree she heard her husband calling for her, he was saying "hey come here i think i found something helpful"
when she replied "well thank god."
she went into the direction where he was
when she felt a tap on her shoulder.
She immediately jumped and turned to see who or what it was, when her husband shushed her and quietly said 
"Something is out here, we need to find our way out now!.."

She confusedly replied 
"What do you mean, i thought you was calling my name just a minute ago?.."

He shook his head no and said
"When i went to the bathroom i heard you call for help from a distance, only to hear a branch break behind me to see you going the opposite direction."

She said back "Well i heard you telling me you found something helpful and thats why i went this way."

He shook his head and told her 
"This isnt normal, we need to get out of this forrest as soon as we can."

With that being said they went in the opposite direction from which they heard the voices coming from, they hurried along when suddenly another voice was heard from behind them saying 
"Hello there im park ranger Sgt.Drewdetski how may i help you."
they turned around and was fixing to reply when they noticed nobody was there.
 
Stumbled and confused they begin to run, and while they where running they could hear whispers and screams crying for help. 
They could hear the voices calling for help while other voices where crys and screams begging them to stay, the couple began crying and screaming out "Nooo! Leave us alone!! Please!.."
they soon stumbled upon a small hill and quickly climbed it as fast as they could and realized on the top was a road, noticing this they looked and soon as they reached the road a car swerved out of the way to avoid hitting them.

Confused the driver got out and said 
"What the hell!?"
the couple ignored the stranger and ran across the road back into the civilization they knew.
And to this day they hardly mentioned it unless asked about it, now they take different routes and avoid the forrest as best as they can thinking maybe we should of asked instead. . .
