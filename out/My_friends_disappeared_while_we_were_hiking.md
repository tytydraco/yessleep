My friends and I went on a hike the other day. I took the lead for the first few kilometres, guiding our group of five across the open bog since I, supposedly, understood the marshy terrain the best. And I did a good job picking out the safe paths, there were only a few minor mishaps resulting in soft cursing and muddy bottoms, but we persevered until we found the bog road that led us up the mountain. 

Periodically I looked behind me to check on my friends, but also to take in the view behind us. As we got steadily higher, the little sliver of sea visible above faraway hills got steadily wider. The view from the top promised to be spectacular. 

Spirits were high as our boots crunched along the bog road. The road was in better shape than most as it had been resurfaced to service the forestry ahead of us. Rory was entertaining us with a scene-by-scene breakdown of exactly why *Avatar: The Way of Water* was a terrible film. Pop culture was his “thing”, and he could talk for hours on a single subject. 

“I’m sorry I asked,” Orla whispered to me. “I didn’t realise he felt so strongly about it.” 

I stifled a laugh. Orla should have known better by now than to ask Rory for his opinion. 

Aisling was arguing back that there couldn’t possibly have been that many plot holes in a billion-dollar blockbuster but Rory wasn’t having it. 

“I suggest the six of us go see it tonight, just to prove I’m right,” he insisted. 

“All of this hate-watching is exactly why bad films make big money,” Timmy chimed in. 

I stopped to fish a stone from my shoe and counted my friends as they passed. Rory was right, there were six of us. I must have forgotten to count myself in the group earlier. Now with Timmy in front the pace got a little slower. Not that Timmy was less fit, he just saw no need to rush. I looked back at the view once again, still beautiful. So beautiful in fact, I felt it couldn’t be real. I guess that’s a feature of living in such a beautiful place; part of me just can’t conceive how lucky I am. 

“Aidan, what’s that nice flowery tree?” Aisling asked, desperate to change the subject. 

“Hawthorn,” Aidan replied. “A native thorn tree, very closely associated with fairies. To chop one down is still considered extremely taboo to many people.” 

Aidan was the opposite of Rory in many ways. He had sworn off social media and scorned internet culture in favour of a slower pace of life. He found his fulfilment in observing the natural world and he was practically overflowing with knowledge just waiting for someone to ask. I figured they could write an encyclopaedia between the two of them. 

The hawthorn in question was a gnarled old thing, bent over from the harsh winds, all its branches pointing the same direction as if directing them up the mountain. I didn’t believe in fairies of course, but I could see how that creepy-looking tree could make a superstitious person uneasy. Was it the way its thorny branches twisted and writhed as if in pain? Was it the fact it stood alone, the only natural tree on this part of the hillside, with no clear explanation for how it came to grow here? As we left the tree behind and approached the vanguard of the artificial forestry, I couldn’t help but look back at that lone sentinel and feel an odd sadness, like we had left something sentimental behind. 

The sudden cool air of the forestry made me shudder. The road we were on would take us straight through to the other side where an unkept quad track would carry on to the summit. Forestries always carried a weird vibe. The trees put all their effort in growing upwards, remaining as thin as toothpicks and completely bare of branches except for a cluster at the top. Nothing grew on the forest floor, just writhing roots bursting from thin soil and a few scatterings of moss. The only sounds were those we made ourselves. Nothing natural lived here. 

Aidan began a lecture about the horrors of monoculture and the failure of the government to promote native woodlands, preferring instead the fast-growing fir plantations. As he spoke, I found myself glancing over my shoulder. In the distance I could see the single hawthorn, framed by the bowed entrance to the forestry, and the blue ocean beyond it. Its draw was immense, as though it were calling me back. 

The subject naturally changed again, and the boys began talking about Timmy’s recent wedding, at which they had both been groom’s men. Orla stopped to tie her shoelace; Aisling and I waited with her. 

“How did we all fit in your car, Ash?” I asked. It had been bothering me for awhile. 

“What do you mean?” she replied, puzzled. 

“There are six of us and only five seats in a car.” 

“It’s a people carrier, it has seven seats,” Aisling said, mystified. “Did you not notice?” 

“Oh... I guess I wasn’t paying attention,” I mumbled. I knew in my heart it wasn’t right, but I couldn’t say why. I just knew Aisling did not drive a people carrier. 

Orla finished tying her lace and the two of them began walking again. I hesitated a moment, finding myself once again looking back the way we came. This weird woodland dead zone was triggering every lizard-brain instinct I had. It just wasn’t right. But I couldn’t say why. 

Another half an hour further on, Orla began to complain. 

“This forest is endless, I thought we would be at the top by now!” she moaned. 

“Hiking always takes longer than you think it will,” Timmy assured her. “Because walking uphill makes you slower.” 

“I’m not an idiot, Timmy,” Orla snapped. “I just think it’s taking longer than it should. Are you sure we’re on the right road?” 

“There’s only one road,” said Rory. “It goes straight through. You’re just misremembering how big this forestry is.” 

He was right. There was indeed only one road, and it ran straight through the middle of the forestry and out the other side. We were on it, and we had definitely not taken any turns or shortcuts. However, Orla had a point; the forestry was not that big. It should not be taking us this long to get through it. Our hike was barely three kilometres; half an hour should have had us halfway to the top, well above the treeline. I looked at my watch, but I hadn’t checked the time when we set off, so I had no idea how long we had been walking. 

I looked over my shoulder again, but this time I was not looking for the view. The hairs were standing on the back of my neck. I could no longer see the entrance. The trees carried on to the vanishing point in every direction, planted in perfectly straight grid lines that gave off the most uncanny feeling. The road we’d come and the road ahead looked exactly the same. Come to think of it, we were no longer even climbing, the ground was flat. We were walking through an infinite, liminal space. 

I felt sick as my heart rate tripled and I jogged forward to catch up. 

“You’re panting!” Aidan teased. “I thought you were fitter than that.” 

“I’m fine,” I murmured. “This forest is just freaking me out.” 

“Oh, not you too,” Timmy scoffed. “It’s not much further now.” 

I glanced down at my watch again, it didn’t have a second hand, and I couldn’t tell if it had moved since I last looked at it. 

“It must be the fairies messing with us,” Rory joked. “Slowing down time to confuse us.” 

“You wouldn’t get a fairy somewhere as unnatural as this,” Orla said flatly. “We left them behind at the hawthorn.” 

“Oh, come on,” Timmy whined. “Can we stop with all this spooky nonsense? Rory, there must be some good drama happening in the streaming community, please, enlighten me.” 

Rory happily obliged, filling the increasingly oppressive silence with babble about nothing. 

We soon stopped for a water break and Aidan decided to take charge. 

“I suggest the five of us take a shortcut. If we go that way, it should take us out just below the crags and we can go up the steep side from there.” 

The others nodded and murmured their agreement, but I wasn’t convinced. 

“It’s a straight road through,” I argued. “Mathematically, the road is the shortest way. What you’re saying is impossible.” 

“Alright, no need to flex your engineering degree on us,” Timmy snarled. “You’re wrong though. The road isn’t straight, it curves off to the left and runs the length of the forestry. We probably should have turned off at the fork awhile ago.” 

I couldn’t believe my ears. This man was talking nonsense. The road in front of us was very visibly straight, and I knew it was straight from the dozens of times I’d climbed this mountain before. Also, we had never passed a fork. We hadn’t passed any kind of side road at all. 

Again I looked back down the road. I had no idea what I was looking for, but I needed to look. It was wrong, all wrong. I looked back at the four of them, glaring at me as if I was the crazy one. Four of them. 

“Where’s Aisling?” I exclaimed in horror. 

“Aisling?” Aidan asked, puzzled. “Aisling Moran? She’s not here.” 

“She was here,” I insisted, getting angry. “She drove us all here.” 

The others looked concerned. 

“You drove us here,” Orla said. “And in any case, if Aisling were here that would make six of us and we wouldn’t all fit in a car.” 

Timmy snorted. “So much for the engineering degree.” 

“Look, this creepy forest is doing weird things to our heads,” Rory spoke up. “I think I’ve touched enough grass for the month. Let’s take the shortcut so we can finish this and get back to our lives as quickly as possible.” 

The others agreed and began walking off the road and into the forest. I hesitated, still looking around for Aisling. She wasn’t here. But she *had* been here. I couldn’t have driven us because I didn’t have enough seats. But neither did Aisling. Distracted by my racing thoughts, I stumbled off the path to follow the others before they went out of sight. 

Someone was here who shouldn’t be. I was certain that Aisling had picked me up at my house with the boys already in the back. So it was Orla. 

But no, because we went to Orla’s house directly after. 

It was one of the boys, but which one? 

I pulled out my phone and opened my gallery. I scrolled through to find the photos from the wedding. I found one of the bridal party lined up outside the church and that’s when I realised what was wrong. 

Aidan wasn’t there. Not in the bridal party, not at the wedding. But he had just been speaking to Timmy about it as though he were there. I scrolled frantically, but couldn’t find a single photo of him. We weren’t friends with Aidan, he didn’t exist. 

I felt like a bucket of cold water had been thrown over me as the spell was broken. I looked up from my phone, my mouth already open to shout to my real friends, but they were nowhere in sight. I stopped and looked around. The trees were planted in perfectly straight rows and columns, creating a grid that looked exactly the same in every direction. I had no idea which way we had come or which way they had gone. I began screaming their names in desperation but only one answered me: Aidan. 

Suddenly realising that I did not want to find out who or what Aidan truly was, I began running back the way I’d come. I couldn’t have been more than fifty metres from the road, but I couldn’t find it. Panicked, I began zigzagging through trees in the hopes I could lose him. It didn’t work, I still heard his voice in the distance and his soft footsteps as he searched for me. Taking a pause with my back against a tree, I felt a tug in my chest. A familiar feeling, like I had felt when leaving the hawthorn tree. The draw. 

Not knowing what else to do, I decided to follow the draw. I ran as straight as I could this time, with no idea if I was right or for how long this seemingly infinite forest could continue. I heard Aidan behind me, gaining. 

I pressed harder but my lungs were already burning and my hiking boots were restricting my stride. I dared not look back, but I could tell that whatever was following me was galloping on four legs. It panted like a hoarse dog and it smelled like rotting flesh. Still harder I ran but it drew nearer with every step until I could feel its hot breath on my neck. 

Then I saw it. A tree, tall and straight like the rest, but standing ever so slightly out of line. The feeling in my chest was pulling me towards it. I had no idea if this meant anything, if it was significant, if it could save me, but I was out of time and out of ideas. I charged at the anomalous tree and right as I thought my legs would give out beneath me and I would fall victim to this foul monster, I passed the crooked tree and the world suddenly opened up. 

I found myself sprinting down the gravel forestry road towards the solitary hawthorn tree. My pursuer was gone. But so were my friends. 

I kept running past the fairy tree and through the bog until I came to the car, Aisling’s five-seater car. Only then did I dare to stop and look back. I don’t know what I expected, but I was disappointed to see nobody. 

Nobody on the road or crossing the bog. 

Nobody entering or leaving the forestry. 

And nobody climbing the mountain above. 

It's been three days since then, the whole parish has been out scouring the hills from dawn to dusk. Dogs, helicopters, even the army - nobody can find any trace of my friends. The officials of course think I'm delusional, that my story is a hallucination my brain made with the stress of my friends going missing.

But I know I'm not crazy and the old folk of the village know it too. They mutter under their breath as they bring tea and sandwiches to the searchers, old tales of fairies and raths and changelings. But they aren't quite right - the fairy tree is what saved me.

It's the forestry that holds the evil.
