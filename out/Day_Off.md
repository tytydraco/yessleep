I had a free day, so I decided to go for a walk downtown. I got there by car. I begun walking, and admiring the buildings, I went to a park. 

Then, I got hungry. I decided to go get myself a hotdog. As I approached the stand, I noticed a poor woman begging. I gave her some cash, and then bought her a hotdog as well.

We struck a conversation. She said her name was Michelle. We walked to a nearby bench. I had thoughts. I had a gut feeling I should leave.

But there was something about the way she talked, I couldn't leave. She then told me she saw me online, and asked me to help her, or else the whole family will be evicted.

She insisted I should go with her, to see the place, to which I agreed. We went to my car, then, after a quick stop at the bank, to get the money, we were on our way!

I noticed the road taking us to the poor side of town. Half-decayed, weed covered buildings.

I wanted to turn the car around and leave. But I promised Michelle I would pay her bills. And a visit. She told me to stop.

We reached a small house, old. Next to it, there was a poorly kept graveyard. She led me into the house.

I saw two kids, a boy and a girl. They hugged her.

"Mummy, you're back!!" said the little girl.

"Dad is hungry." said the boy, to which the woman put a comforting smile.

I was invited to take a seat at the table. The woman brought me a glass of coke. The children begun playing.

"Mum! Dad told me he's hungry." said the boy. "I know, honey, I know." I asked Michelle if they had any food and if they wanted me to buy them some groceries.

Michelle thanked me, but said the road to the store goes through the graveyard. She jokingly asked me if I was scared. I said no, why would I?

She helped the two kids get dressed, then we left. Eerie tombs, old. We got past a crypt. Then, I asked Michelle were was her husband. She told me she'll be with us soon.

The sunset was near. It was getting dark. We were halfway across the graveyard when we stopped.

I was like  What's going on?? "Dad said we should meet with him here". said the girl. "Yeah, and he's hungry".

I handed Michelle some money, then told her I need to leave and she should do her groceries, but she insisted to wait.

I wanted to leave, but the two kids started to play with me. I played with them as well. The play turned very aggressive. I saw a certain violence in the way they played. And I noticed they kept blocking my path.

The boy then bit my hand. I bled. Just a little. I instinctively backed off. The two kids, and now Michelle too were approaching me. Cornering me. Their eyes changed color. In them, I saw them for the predators they were.

I kicked the boy, but I noticed a man I haven't seen before. He growled. Foamed at his mouth. 

And those sharp, sharp fangs made me literally pee on myself. The kids had fangs, Michelle levitated. I made the sign of the cross as I mentally prayed. 

The vampires backed off a bit, just enough for me to run. And I ran, and I got to my car. I realized I lost my keys. The girl jumped on my back, tackling me to the ground. I kicked her.

I started to cry. They all approached, eyes fully black, sharp teeth and growling like wolves.

Then, I saw a car. My wife's car. I ran to it. The vampires charged after me.

My wife got out, flamethrower in hands. The enemies backed off. I stood my ground. A burst of flames turned Michelle to ashes. The others fled. Faded out into the night.

I feel on my knees, crying like never before. My wife helped me get inside the car. She drove away, as I told her everything.

We got home. Safety. My wife said she was tracking my phone just for fun, when she noticed I was in an area known for vampires.

That's when she thought something was wrong and I was in danger. We chatted. To forget. To calm down.

But they are out there. How can I stay relaxed?
