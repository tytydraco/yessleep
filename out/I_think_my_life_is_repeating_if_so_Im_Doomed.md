(all real experienced by me) I get the title is a little off and I had to repost this since it got removed before. Lately I’ve been having nightmares of something that happened when I was little. For starters Im going to let you know Im in a relationship with this guy I met around 19, I’ll call him Cole. We’ve been together for four years now and the relationship is extremely toxic and he has been abusive in the past. 
Anyways I’ve been feeling more and more like i want to leave him and with that i’ve been having very intense nightmares and remembering something from when I was about eight. 


When i was around eight I had a sleepover with two other girls (I’ll call them Susie and Lucy) well at some point we were talking about ghost stories and Susie told us how she remembers her past life and remembers us all being friends as adults. Im not sure why but Lucy and I agreed and said we sorta remembered too. 


That’s when Susie turns to me and said “I was heartbroken when I heard what happened to you back then, was it scary to be murdered?” I remember this night as an adult so clearly and Im not sure what possessed me to say “I don’t remember much, just being on my bike by the railroad tracks then nothing..” I went on to say how I remembered that day was good and I thought it would be nice to take a ride down the bike trail. 

         
Susie  then starts again saying that she heard I was attacked from behind and left to be found in the morning. That’s  when she said it was good thing my ex COLE was caught and that they found evidence from my murder and about the abuse. All three of us then spent the night talking about the details of our past life and mainly about my murder. We talked more about how I had finally left him after years of the abuse and how I was actually happy and doing things on my own before I died.
This still sticks in my head everyday now and i’ve always weirdly had this feeling I would die young for as long as i can remember. 


I mean EVERYTHING that was said about the past matches my current boyfriend, our relationship, my life personally andmy age is also very close to when i last “died”. I want to leave him very badly but this fear is constantly a lump in the back of my throat that I might have the same fate as past “me”. 



I’m curious if this happens to others or if this is some twisted sort of fate Im tangled in? I’m seriously scared….. I keep having nightmares where i’m living somewhere new and he’s terrorizing me like in a horror movie… If this is real and i’m experiencing things i might’ve before from another life or that my life was just foretold in some way I would like to know.
