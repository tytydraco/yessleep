Well, I fucked up. I should’ve immediately gotten rid of my phone. The comment from last post was right. “Matt” had updated some sort of tracker and essentially hacked my phone. With everything going on I wanted to get my wife and the kids as far away as possible. I will not say where exactly they are but just know they are safe. I on the other hand am still in the area dealing with the police investigation. I brought my phone to the local precinct and as one of you suspected he had loaded some other software on it. It’s safe to say he has been tracking my whereabouts as well as having access to my credit cards and bank accounts. The weird thing is they aren’t maxed out or drained. Purchases have been made that I do not recognize but nothing of extreme value. Some sort of website building membership and electronic store purchases. What could he be doing?

  


The police have advised me to destroy the phone and get a brand new one, with a new number, and a different carrier. I quickly went to the closest cell phone store and requested a new number. Within minutes everything was in order. I contacted the bank and credit card companies to inform them of the fraud that was taking place. They assured me that it would be taken care of and I don’t need to worry. I called my wife and told her about the new phone and situation at hand. She was scared and rightly so. 

  


“Be careful. Get out of that town, who knows what else he knows. Isn’t there anyway you can help with this and be with us, away from there.”

  


“I want to put an end to all of this. He attacked me, he invaded our home, our privacy. He showed up to our house when just our kids were home. I am putting this guy away and making sure he never does this again to us or anyone else.”

  


“Please be safe, I love you.”

  


“I love you too.”

  


It wasn’t 30 seconds after I hung up that I received a call from a number I did not recognize.

  


“Hello?”

  


“Hello Phil, Matt from Pristine Alarms checking in. How are the wife and kids?”

  


“How the fuck did you find this number and don’t you dare mention my wife or kids.”

  


“Philly, relax my friend. I am just an honest worker who deeply cares about his clients. I know they were scared and left. But you stayed, why?”

  


“Why did I stay?! To make sure you are fucking locked away you psycho! We are going to catch you and when we do, I will know my family is safe.”

  


“Aren’t you scared of being away from them now? No husband or father to protect them. Let me tell you about our top of the line security package-“

  


“Shut your fucking mouth, I will find you and when I do-“

  


“You will do nothing. Anyway Phil it was good catching up, hope all is well. Thank you for the upgrade to my equipment. Couldn’t do it without you. Oh be sure to check our website and leave a glowing review.”

  


He hung up.

  


What the hell do I do now? I have to notify the police again. Maybe they can track it next time. Maybe they can finally put an end to this.

  


After contacting the police for what feels like the 100th time, I decided to head back to the hotel I was staying at. They have a small office that can be used for remote work or to print something if needed so I decided to use their computer. I typed in “Pristine Alarms” to the search engine. The first result was a website that I hadn’t seen when I previously tried to search for this company. I clicked on it. “At Pristine Alarms we value our customers. It is of utmost importance that our customers feel safe and secure when using our equipment.”

  


“You’re fucking kidding me.” I muttered to myself.

  


I scanned the website and found a “reviews” tab. There were 100s of reviews. All of which had to be fake. This asshole was using my money and credit cards to fund this. To buy equipment. To do this to other people. How do I stop this? I noticed an address. When I looked it up it came back to a commercial building not too far from my old address. I wrote it down. I had a plan. Was it smart?

No. Did I care? No. I was going to get this son of a bitch even if it meant using myself as bait.

  


I called the number that contacted me earlier.

  


“Pristine Alarms, Matt speaking how can I help you?”

  


“Cut the act, this isn’t a real company and YOU are just some sort of depraved loser.”

  


“Ah Phil, do ya like the website? Looks legit huh?”

  


“Fuck off. You want to torment me so bad. Come and get me I’m sure you know where I am.”

  


“You? Noooo, you’re old news now. I want to move on to different people. I want to help another family feel safe.”

  


“I won’t let that happen, the police won’t let that happen.”

  


“Oh but you will, I have some business to attend to out of town. I can always cancel my trip IF you help me.”

  


“Help you? Are you fucking serious-“

  


“Phil I know where your wife and kids are staying. I mean it wasn’t hard to figure out. I had access to your phone for days after our little hiccup at the house.”

  


“I will kill you.”

  


“You won’t. You will help me promote my business. You will help me bring in new customers. That address on the website, that is real. I am here right now. Come by, let’s chat in person. And if you mention ANY of this to law enforcement, well-“

  


I received a text on my phone. I pulled it away from my ear. It was a link to a live video of my wife and the kids. They were in the hotel lobby coming back in with fast food bags. This sick fuck had somehow hacked the hotel cameras where my family was staying.

  


“I’m on my way. No cops, please don’t do anything to my family.”
