Every night at 4:09 AM someone or something knocks on my door.
It all started on a dark Saturday night. I was laying in bed with my fast asleep snoring husband. I couldn’t sleep because of his snoring so I decided to read some stories on Reddit. When I checked the time it was 4:07 AM. Shit. I had been reading stories for 3 full hours. I set my broken phone on my white nightstand and decided to try to fall asleep. 

In my trying to tune out the snoring of my husband, thats when I heard it. 4 whole knocks on my front door. I checked the time, 4:09 AM. I was startled because of the noise and the fact that how could someone be knocking at the door so late? And if it was the neighbors that isn’t possible too because they left for a 2 week vacation a couple of days ago.  I decided to ignore who ever it was because I sure as heck wasn’t going to get up at 4:09 AM  see who it was and open the door. I couple of minutes later I drifted off to sleep. 

When I finally woke up I turned expecting to see my beloved husband beside me either sleeping or awake I saw something more horrifying. Something even after therapy that you were never going to forget. I saw my husband, my poor sweet old husband was surrounded by a pool of blood. He was missing what it seemed like 4 limps and he had 409 stab wounds all over his body. I screamed so hard I think I broke some glass and my neighbors even on their vacation in Hawaii heard me.

 When the police saw me they immediately knew I wasn’t the one who murdered him. He was a strong, tall and buff man. He was my man. And now he was gone. The funeral was a complete blur. I only remember crying hard while his mom and my mom held me. When I got home that night I decided to sleep on the couch. I couldn’t bear sleeping in that bed knowing that my husband was murdered there. It didn’t make sense to me how I didn’t wake up. How I didn’t hear anything. 

When I finally feel asleep thats when I heard the exact same 4 knocks. When I checked my watch it was exactly 4:09 AM. I decided to open the door. I thought maybe it was the neighbors had flown early to console me. When I opened the door all I saw was a package and a note. On the note it said:

-it was me. I was the one who murdered your husband. If you don’t want to lose someone close to you again keep opening the door every night when I knock 4 times. You will continue to open the door until the very night I stop. 

I brought the package inside and when I opened it i was horrified. Inside the package were my dear old husband 4 missing limbs.
