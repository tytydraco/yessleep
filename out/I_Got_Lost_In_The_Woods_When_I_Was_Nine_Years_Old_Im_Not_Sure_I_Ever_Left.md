“Don’t go playing in those woods alone.” 

That was my mother’s advice any time I brought up doing something in the forest behind our house.

“There are things out far too scary for young boys like you.” 

She was right, of course. A nine year old child has no business running around the woods alone. Obviously, a nine year old child wouldn’t understand that either.

There is nothing important to tell you about my life until that point, certainly not relevant to what would happen. My mother did the best she could. So, I’ll stick to the part relevant to understanding the woods. 

My family moved often for the first few years of my life. Something to do with my father’s job, when that still mattered. Once that was no longer a factor, we needed somewhere affordable to settle down. The run-down house just on the edge of the middle of nowhere, along no desirable commute paths, was perfect. It was an affordable house, back when that was still a thing. 

You can imagine those woods were a recipe for adventure for any young boy. At least, any young boy who’d never had the money to take electronic fun. My mother, sensibly, discouraged me from going in alone. There was far too much potential for me to be left lying hurt and alone in the woods, or to just get lost. It wasn’t a colossal forest, but more than enough for a nine year old to get in trouble in. 

Maybe it wouldn’t have been a problem, and maybe none of this would have ever happened if I’d had more of a friend group. But that wasn’t to be, I’d been moved around too many times and I think slipped a little bit too far in my own head. I always fit in poorly, the far out house no one wanted to visit sealed the deal. 

Which is to say, it was a done deal that I was destined to be one of the great childhood explorers, finding burrows, creeks, and cliffs (holes left by upturned trees, if you must be pedantic) everywhere and christening them in the childhood manner. Little Creek, Big Creek, Far Out Cliff. I’ll admit I was not a creative name-giver, but not for lack of spirit. 

I did mostly follow my mother’s advice though. The fields around the house were less scary anyway. So for a while, I explored those and only dipped into the fringes of the forest. 

It wouldn’t last. In time, I grew bored of the same fields. I needed new ground to discover. I needed to fill in the blanks on the useless child’s “maps” I had drawn.

I needed the woods. 

And so, I began to dip deeper and deeper in on each journey until one day I decided to break from my fears and go all in. I would set out with the formal intention to explore the forest. 

Childhood logic prevailing, I brought the gear I thought explorers should have. A compass that I had no real idea how to use and a small Swiss Army knife. Confident that this level of preparation would keep me safe, I headed out.

The basic feel of the woods was nothing new to me. It was a fairly level pine forest. I know now that it was mostly cleared ground let to regrow out from just a few patches of actually old woods. As such, the ground was easy to traverse, with only a scattering of gorges and ponds where nature slowly began to properly reclaim the land over the decades. 

So I went in like the little explorer I’d become. It was fun for a while. I tried to be sensible and left behind markers to help me find my way back. I think a few of them could have actually worked even. Most of them were made with a child’s logic. I could totally see that one stick standing up when lost in the forest, or so a nine year old me would have insisted. 

The deeper I went in, the darker it became. Not in a magical way. Well, at least I don’t think so. The woods were becoming thicker, significantly so. My excitement did not dim though. I found a large burrow nestled among some roots and cataloged it—that is, I scribbled an illegible note on a “map”. 

Then it was off again. It took me a while to realize I was seeing oak trees, and what that meant. 

I was in the old woods. 

Actually, I didn’t know that then. I did notice that the woods were changing though, and even then I was able to piece together that I was entering something deeper. I started shading the map, to mark off what I called the place of fallen leaves, as fewer needles and more leaves blanketed the ground the deeper I went. 

The ground was different too. Old, rotted fallen logs began to appear, deep pits of fallen trees became commonplace, and it felt like the thick canopy was trapping humid air within it. I felt even more like a jungle explorer. I scrambled up another mound of dirt to get a view ahead and choose my next route. It was wet and loose under my little hands and feet, but I triumphed. 

I let out a gasp at the top. 

The view was amazing. The mossy oaks and foggy air blended into a perfect green canvas under the faint rays of sunlight that managed to penetrate the forest canopy. A bit away in front of me, a cluster of such trees created a heavily shadowed spot. Their trunks seemed to be leaning in towards each other, creating an odd sort of natural shelter. 

That spot, I decided, would be my final destination for the day, and the masterpiece of my explorations. It would surely be a wonderful future hideaway and fort. 

I hadn’t fully accounted on how loose the soil was on the other side of the hill. I had looked down and saw it was steep, but in the dim and foggy woods, I underestimated how treacherous the slope was and thought I could go down the same way I came up. I was wrong.

What had looked like a safe foothold gave out from under me. The hill was steeper on the leeward side than the exposed side I had come from, so my small frame immediately went tumbling down harshly. Unfortunately, like most forest mounds that one was filled with sticks and rocks. I felt the pain of striking the first few. Mercifully, it ceased to be a problem after only a moment.

I blacked out before I hit the bottom. 

I woke up in those same woods covered in dirt and twigs and insect blood. I heaved and pushed myself up. 

Everything looked the same. The rays of sunlight were filtering through the trees at the same angle and the woods looked no darker. Relief washed over me that I would not be caught in the forest alone at night and could still avoid a scolding for my unpermitted adventure. 

Naturally, my spill made me more nervous. I wanted out of there and into the safety of my home. Still, that nook in the trees was only a dash away, and I was already down on that side of the hill. It only made sense to check it out and then hurry back. 

I rushed across the ground, trying to keep my eyes on the goal. That was not as easy on the ground as it had been from my high point. Underbrush, fallen branches, and twisting roots forced me off of a straight line. I had to turn off course to work around the many obstacles in my path.

Each time I rounded something and could see my goal, I somehow seemed to have gotten no closer. That didn’t frighten me the first few times. Everything was hazy and indistinct in that grove, it wasn’t hard for my young mind to imagine that I hadn’t gauged the distance quite right. 

It was when it happened again, and then again that I got scared. What was going on? I knew I was going forward. It doesn’t take an adult to know that if you’re moving forward, you should be able to tell. And, that you can’t be getting turned around when you can still see the destination.

I was getting scared fast. The fort could wait. Scratch that, I decided I wasn’t interested in coming back at all. My mother was right, some places just weren’t made for a kid like me. 

I turned around. That was the first time I had looked back since trying to reach the circle of trees and was I saw chilled me: I was just as far away from the hill I had come from as I was from my destination. 

How was that possible? How could I have gotten not an inch closer to the trees, but have moved so far away from the hill?

I didn’t know what to do. Nothing made sense anymore by then. I did know what I was going to do though. 

I ran. I ran back the way I come, hoping I could somehow outrun whatever was trapping me there. As I said, the ground was rough. I was tripped, snagged, and scraped constantly. I had the power of youthful terror on my side though, pushing me forward. 

That was when things started to change. The forest became darker as I ran. I was still making no progress, my heart was pounding, even the energy of a child could not keep me going forever. 

Then I heard it. 

Snapping and tearing sounds shattered the silence behind me. I was not alone in those woods anymore. 

I’m sure I was sobbing by that point. It was all too much. I refused to turn around. I just ran. I flung myself over roots. I scrambled through the dirt. But there was no escape. Those woods had no end. 

I felt something big and strong grab me. Pain radiated across my torso as I was crushed in the grasp of something old and dark and horrible. It hoisted me into the air.

I blacked out screaming.

I woke up with a scream, pushing myself up in total panic. 

I was at the bottom of the hill—the same hill—covered in dirt, and jabbed full of sticks, and wet with insect’s blood. 

I sobbed. Maybe a little bit was relief, but mostly it was horror; horror at being in that place yet again. 

I slowly clawed back up the side of the hill, so numb I could even ignore the centipedes crawling across my back. Some part of me believed that if I could just cross that hill I could avoid being trapped deep within that place. I never once dared to look back in. 

It seemed to work. After several agonizing minutes, I passed the crest of the hill and let myself roll down the other side. Looking forward, I let myself cry out in relief.

It was the normal forest: pine trees, and just a few old oaks. No nooks of old trees. 

I noticed the time for the first time too. The sun was coming in just a little lower as if not much time had passed, I hadn’t passed out for long. 

I staggered home. It was slow going, of course. I had only half a clue which way to go and was far too tired and scared to find my markers. The place wasn’t big or dense enough for me to get fully lost in. With a very basic idea of which way to head, I found my way out in time. 

Even late, I still got home before my mother. When setting out on my journey, that that would be the case was a source of security. I hated it in that moment though. I wanted an adult presence to push away the incomprehensible fear like they always could. Getting scolded for my journey no longer even placed on my list of fears. 

I didn’t bother to cover up all of my scrapes and bruises. I wanted to admit what happened. I felt a childish guilt, like my disobedience had led me to this, as absurd as that idea was. That chance finally came a few hours later with my mother’s arrival home.

“What happened to you? Have a tumble running about again?” She wasn’t too concerned at first.  My mother was never one to care too much about roughhousing, just taking it as a normal part of growing up when kept within reason. 

“No! It was the woods.” I insisted, wanting to explain everything but not knowing how.

“The woods?” She immediately interrupted me. “You know you’re not supposed to play in there. You could get lost or hurt.” 

“I did!” I cried back. “I was lost, and I couldn’t get out, it was the same place no matter where! And then the thing got me!” 

I know nothing I said made sense. I’m sure that was only the idea of whatever words I actually spoke. 

She could tell I was earnestly distressed. 

“It’s alright.” I was pulled into a warm and comforting hug. “Now you know why I warned you not to go in alone. No need to cry. You’re safe now.” 

The rest of the day was quiet, a comforting dinner and some games to help me forget my ordeal. 

Then it was time for bed. I passed out the moment my head hit the pillow. 

I woke up in the woods. My body ached from tumbling down that hill. 

I was covered in dirt. The taste of rotted soil filled my mouth.

Sticks tangled in my hair. 

My body wet with insect’s blood.

My nightmare was just beginning.
