Ever since I entered the scientific community, there's been one event whispered about reverently, almost like a myth—the Ascendant Minds Science Convention. You can't apply to go; you can only be invited. And this year, I've finally received my invitation.

As I hug my wife and kids goodbye, a sense of foreboding washes over me. "See you in two days," I assure them, suppressing my unease.

My colleague Sarah and I booked our flights together. As peers, we have often exchanged ideas about the latest advancements in science. The atmosphere at the convention is electric upon our arrival. Booths display cutting-edge technologies; discussions about quantum mechanics, AI, and space travel fill the air.

But then, I hear him: Dr. Anthony Steel. A crowd gathers around him, captivated by his every word. "Quantum mechanics, dark matter; we stand on the brink of unraveling the very fabric of reality," he declares.

Sarah nudges me. "Ask him something, Adam. You've got to."

Summoning courage, I ask, "What do you think about the potential effects of dark matter on human consciousness?"

Locking eyes with me, Dr. Steel says, "Ah, Dr. Warren, isn't it? Why don't you and your colleague join me after the event? I have something to show you."

As people start to disperse, Dr. Steel grabs onto my arm, surprisingly strong. "Please stay; we have much to discuss. Why don't you and your peer come over after the event is settled, and I'll show you what I've been working on?"

I've never been more excited. Finally, my opportunity to get a word in and discuss my interest in the interplay between neuroscience and quantum physics.Hours later, Sarah and I find ourselves following Dr. Steel down a hidden elevator into his private lab. "Welcome. I've been working in this lab for a long time now," he murmurs as we step into a space that looks like it's out of a sci-fi movie.

I marvel at an intricate setup labeled 'NeuroQuantum Interface 3000.' "This is astounding. How where you able to get your hands on this?"

"Ah, it's not about getting your hands on it. It's about daring to conceive it," Dr. Steel said with a deeper voice.My eyes shift to the left and land on something indescribable, glowing but not with light. "What's that?"

"This is dark matter, contained," he declares, then a long pause ensues. "I've found a way to integrate it with human consciousness."

“Is it safe?” Sarah asks.

"Safe?" Dr. Steele mutter, "Nothing in this world is safe, just as nothing is dangerous. I consider it revolutionary." 

I turn to face Dr. Steel, and his eyes… they are no longer just eyes. They're dark voids, pulling me in.

"I'm glad you finally came. Together, we'll be able to truly make a change," he whispers. His voice now feels like it's coming from everywhere and nowhere.

Sarah tries to scream, but no sound comes. It's as if the air itself refuses to carry her voice. My skin starts to crawl, a cold sensation envelops me. My gut screams for me to run, but my body is frozen and then it hits me, as if I was knocked out. 

Jolting awake, I find myself back in my bedroom. It's still August 12, the day before the convention. Shaking off the nightmare, I head for the shower. 

I hop in, eager to wash away the nightmare. But then, the water turns boiling hot. "What the…?” I yell, soap stinging my eyes. I reach to turn the knob, but it breaks off in my hand. "Freaking old house," I mutter, jumping out and towel off.

Ready for breakfast, I head downstairs. "Honey, the shower knob broke off. I'll have to shut off the water. Hopefully, we can get a plumber in today," I call out to Mary. No response. I turn and find Mary and our daughter Ellie standing there, staring straight at me. "Honey?" I can feel the tension rise. As I walk closer, I realize they don't have eyes, just black voids—like Dr. Steel's. Blood begins to seep from their mouths, noses, and ears.

I back up and scramble towards the door, flinging it open only to find—nothing. Just darkness. I start to pant, and then I see Ellie, now holding a knife in her hand. "Daddy?" she says, but her voice is unnaturally deep.

"Come join us," Mary says, suddenly appearing behind me. Her grip tightens on my arms as Ellie approaches, knife in hand. I scream, as loud and as hard as I can, straining against Mary's iron grip. Just as Ellie's knife slices across my throat, and as my vision fills with gushing blood, everything fades out.

Darkness.
I wake up, back in the lab. My hands shoot up to my face; I'm covered in something. Blood? I pull them back to see that it's not red, but black. My eyes dart to Sarah—Dr. Steel is on top of her, his mouth over hers, pumping what seems like this black liquid into her mouth. My stomach turns; I vomit on the spot.

In the corner of the room, I spot a maintenance hatch. Summoning what little strength I have left, I sprint to Sarah, stabbing Dr. Steel with a pen from my pocket and shoving him off her. I grab Sarah's arm and yank her toward the hatch, shoving her through first. We scramble through dark, narrow tunnels, Dr. Steel's guttural voice haunting us from behind. "I'll be waiting for you, Adam."

We burst out into the night, the facility looming ominously behind us. We run until we're miles away. I spot a convenience store, grab two hoodies, and head to the cashier, who looks at me in disbelief. I give one to Sarah. "Are you ok?" I ask as she puts it on.

She mutters something and turns to face me. I recoil. Her eyes are pitch black, devoid of life. "You need to get help, Sarah," I say, but her response is garbled, unintelligible.

My stomach knots as I back away, leaving behind the thing that used to be Sarah. My phone is dead when I try to call 911. I run to the hotel, rush into the elevator, and make it to my room. I strip off my clothes, wanting to burn them and jump into the shower, scrubbing the black blood off me. Wrapping a towel around myself, I finally start to feel clean.

But then I heard it—a voice in my head. I try to suppress it, convince myself that I just need rest and to go home.

Stepping out of the shower, I pause at the sink, taking a deep breath. I wipe the fog from the mirror and look into my own eyes. For a brief second, they flash to a pitch black void before returning to normal. I reel back, horrified.

Was it just a trick of the light, or is the darkness now inside me too?
