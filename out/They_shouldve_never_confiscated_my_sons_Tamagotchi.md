Until three weeks ago, I was living what most would consider a simple and happy life. I'm a stay-at-home dad, probably on Reddit more than I care to admit. I met my wife, Noriko (or Nori for short), in Osaka, Japan, twelve years ago during a work trip for an advertising agency. Shortly after we started dating, Nori was offered a senior position at her company's newly opened NYC branch. At the time, I was living in Connecticut but working remotely, so it was an easy decision to move in together in NYC. Plus, her mother has lived in Queens for the past thirty years, so it just made sense.

Three years later, we got married. The following spring, we had our son, Nicholas.

Again, I'd like to emphasize that we've lived what I’d call a pretty normal life. We’ve had our ups and downs, but have never experienced anything quite like what I’m about to share.

Three weeks ago, Nicholas pulled this little gizmo out of his backpack. At first glance, it reminded me of a Tamagotchi. A little piece of plastic that easily could fit in your pocket. Three or four little buttons on the bottom and a cheap display up top. However, the design wasn't colorful like I remember Tamagotchis being. It was obsidian black; from a distance you could easily mistake it for some kind of medical device. And even stranger, I never could actually see any 'pet' on the display. Either way, Nori and I hadn't any clue where he got it from, we presume a friend at school must've gifted it to him. He called it his "Tether Pet" and was nothing short of *obsessed* with it.

I mean, I could understand. I remember getting a Tamagotchi for Christmas when I was his age. It felt like you were responsible for some other life-form. Your relationship with the toy often felt like a life or death situation. Nicky was certainly under a similar spell.

So that same Sunday, we piled into Nori's Corolla and took the BQ Expressway to Mount Sinai Hospital in Queens to visit her Mom, Aki, who's suffering from bone cancer. Nicky was in the back seat, attending to his 'Tether Pet'.

"How's your Tamagotchi buddy?"

"What?"

"Your little pet there"

Nicky is normally eager to yap Nori and I's ear off about whatever his fascination of the day is, but for whatever reason, his tone was flat and serious when discussing his "Tether Pet."

"Fine."

"Oh yea? Do you have a name for him?"

"It's a girl."

"Oh cool! What's her name?"

"Baba, it came with the name, I didn't get to pick it."

Nori tried to play along.

"Baba? That's cute!"

"Not really. She's always hungry. And whenever she poops I have to clean it up."

I let out a laugh.

"Reminds me of somebody I used to know...!"

"No Dad, it's a lot of responsibility! You wouldn't understand."

Nori and I laughed. *Oh, the simple joys of parenthood.*

We arrived at Aki's room only to be held back by a couple of nurses. They asked us to wait while  Grandma's bedpan was changed. It saddened me to think about how Aki had wilted over the past year. It didn't seem long ago she was in our living room bouncing Nicky on her knee, singing that silly old horse racing anthem.

"Bum da da bum da da bum bum bum, bum da da bum da da bum bum bum..."

Nicky loved that. He'd blow up in a fit of laughter every time. Now she couldn't even get out of her hospital bed. It crushed me. But I guess it'd happen to me someday too.

Before I could get too melancholy, a nurse opened the door with a smile.

"She's ready to see you now."

We stepped inside and there was Aki, still glowing, albeit dimly, with her usual tender smile.

Nicky seemed to snap out of his fog with her in sight, running to her bedside.

"Grandma!"

Aki tried to roll over and muster a hug for his reception, but it was clearly too much for her.

Nori and I followed close behind. This had become a very difficult ritual for Nori to get used to.

Aki told us about how her treatment had been going. How she was always in pain, but that there was a still a chance she could get through it. I don't know why but I never had any real faith that she would. I guess I've just seen this scenario play out one too many times. In my experience, at least, it never ended how we all prayed each night that it would.

After some more light conversation and updates on work, school, etc. Nicky pulled out his 'Tether Pet'.

"Oh! How're you liking the new toy Grandma gave you?".

Nori and I looked at each-other flabbergasted. Aki gave it to him? She could barely get out of bed let alone go buy Nicky a toy from the store.

"Aki... where did you get that toy from?"

I asked.

"Oh... I think one of the doctors gave it to me... yes, it's something they're giving to a lot of the patients around here."

It didn't make any sense, but before I could ask more questions, a nurse came in and told us our time was up, and that Aki needed to get some rest.

Nori and I had a couple conversations theorizing about why the hospital would've given her the toy. Maybe it was some charity connected to the hospital... ? Either way, we had more important things to worry about, so as the days went on, we let it go. Everything in our lives continued as normal, until the day Nicky lost his 'Tether Pet'.

It was last week Friday. We were just sitting down for dinner, when Nicky comes shuffling into the room looking on the verge of tears.

"I c-can't find my Tether P-pet".

Nori was setting the table, she had really went all out for us that evening.

"Ok, well, after dinner we can all take a look together to find it."

Observing my son more closely, he wasn't just upset, he looked devasted.

"You d-don't understand, M-mom... she could die if I don't- don't..."

At this point, I decided it was time to do some father-ing. I took a knee.

"Listen Nicholas. I understand your toy is important to you, but its just that right...? A toy. So let's sit down and eat the dinner Mama made us and we can take a look after. Ok?"

I gave him that stern-but-tender look a father gives to ensure his way. Nicky nodded solemnly; I gave him a hug and a rub on the back.

All throughout dinner Nicky avoided our usual conversation starters. How was school? How was soccer practice? What do you want to do this weekend... etc. It was clear his mind was racing. It really rubbed me the wrong way. I don't remember ever being *this* stressed about my Tamagotchi. Just then, Nori's phone rang. She moved to the edge of kitchen to take the call. I watched as her face slowly settled into a more serious expression as she listened to the other end. She responded with simple short acknowledgements of what she was hearing as she walked over to the living room.  She hung up and began to put on her coat.

"Everything ok honey?"

I mouthed to her silently "...Aki?..."

She nodded.

"I think it should be fine, but if it becomes serious I'll call you."

"Sounds good."

I looked to Nicky and provided a distraction.

"Shall we look for "Baba" ?"

Nicky nodded his head frantically, clearly unwilling to wait a even second longer.

We looked around the house for quite some time. He was certain he had come home with it, so I was pretty determined to help him find it. It really felt like looking for a needle in a haystack, though. It wasn't until we were just about to give up that we found it, fallen beneath the shoe rack near his backpack.

I thought for sure we'd have some small celebration of our efforts, but Nicky didn't even smile. He just picked it up and began to shake his head.

"Ah man..."

"What is it buddy?"

"Just a lot of build up."

"Oh? Of what?"

"Poop."

I laughed.

"It's not funny Dad, she could've suffocated".

"From the poop?"

I laughed even harder. I've always had a stupid sense of humor. Nicky, presumably offended by my not taking this seriously, retreated up to his room.

Alone, I decided this would be good a time as any to pop on an old Samurai movie for my own selfish pleasures. Plus a three hour runtime would keep me up long enough in case Nori called. But about halfway into the movie, she came in the door. Sopping wet. I guess it had started raining.

She explained that everything ended up ok; a false alarm. I cut the movie short and we went to bed. As we laid together under the sheets, it was becoming clear she couldn't fall asleep.

"What's wrong babe?"

"When I got to Sinai today... Mom had, an accident."

"Oh? Like she-"

"She shit herself."

I wasn't sure how to respond, but luckily she continued.

"What if... we get so old... or sick... that some stranger has to literally wipe our ass?"

I chuckled.

"I mean... we probably will."

She rolled over and looked at me with playful concern.

"I don't want a stranger to wipe my ass."

"So you're saying it has to be me?"

She finally broke into a giggle.

"Well, how about we just promise to 'take care' of each other, then?"

I kissed her on the cheek.

"Deal."

The next few days were normal, well, the 'new normal'. Nicky seemingly had lost all interest in having friends over with his ongoing 'Tether Pet' responsibilities. In fact, we even got an email from his soccer coach that he was absent-mindedly monitoring his device while on the side-lines. We used to get emails that he needed to stop hogging the ball so much!

One evening, as we put him to bed, we explained that if his 'pet' continued to affect his school participation, that we'd have no choice but to confiscate it from him. He appeared gravely disturbed by this notion.

"That'd make you a murderer."

It was such an absurd thing to say... but he said it with such conviction. A conviction that I don't believe an eight year old should be able to feel. I'd soon understand why.

Yesterday. Around noon. Nicky's at school. Nori's at work. I get a call from the Principal.

"Everything's fine, we just wanted to let you know that we needed to confiscate a toy from your son today. As it was distracting him from class work."

No parent ever enjoys these calls.

"I apologize, we've talked to him about this before. We'll have another chat about it tonight and make sure he gets the message."

"Would you like us to hold onto it for now? Or send him home with it?"

God I wish I could go back in time.

"Hold onto it."

I knew Nicky would be furious, but as a father, I assumed this was a good opportunity for some 'tough love'.  Sure enough, when Nicky got home, he was in a panic.

"Dad, they t-took my 'Tether P-pet' away... she's gonna die Dad... she's gonna D-DIE!"

I got on one knee and gave him my look.

"Even if it dies it'll be ok, because its just a toy right? You can always just start over."

He started crying, as though really accepting the fact that this could really be the end for his 'pet'.

"It's not a just a toy Dad... it feels real... it *is* real..."

Right then, it all clicked. Nicky wasn't grieving a toy. He was grieving his Grandma. I felt a wave of relief, now seemingly able to connect the dots that didn't align to me before. I decided to make this a teaching moment.

"Nicholas. Death is hard. We're all facing that with Grandma right now, right?"

Nicky nodded knowingly.

"But it's a natural part of life. It's not wrong or bad. It's ok. It can feel sad to let somebody go. But everything really will be ok."

"*...r-really?*"

"Come here, pal."

I pulled him in for a hug.

"Death is what makes life special. Its what makes each moment count. It's a good thing."

Snot was running down Nicky's nose onto my shoulder.

"But I don't want Baba to die..."

"I know... I know..."

Just then, my phone began to ring. It was Nori.

"Hey hon, what's up?"

"The hospital just called me, I think its happening"

My heart stopped. I let go of Nicky. He stepped back, feeling my mood shift.

"What'd they say?"

"She's refused to eat or drink all day, including her medications. Then she had a seizure and has only been getting worse since then. Where's Nicky?"

Why did this feel familiar? This sensation. It was like déjà vu...

I could feel myself freezing up. Nicky tapped my knee.

"Daddy? What's wrong?"

I blurted out:

"Honey, what was that name you called Mom as a baby?"

Nori seemed frustrated that I had ignored her question.

"Uh... Gaba? or *Baba*... I think? Babe, you and Nicky need to meet me at Mount Sinai."

A jolt of fear struck down my spine. All of a sudden my mind felt like it was racing ahead of me.

My mother in-law's mortality being connected to a toy was quite the leap, I know... but in that moment, it truly felt crystal clear. How could this happen? It felt like the most basic rules of reality were simply torn out from under me. I had to move; fast.

"We're on our way."

A wall of obsidian clouds lay heavy above our neighborhood. Nicky and I piled into the car.

"Daddy... where are we going?"

"We're... we're going to see Grandma..."

But we'd take a quick detour first.

Nicky looked afraid.

"Is grandma gonna die, Daddy...?

I couldn't respond. What could I even say at that point? I'm supposed to be the voice of reason... but I felt like I was losing it. In fact, it had started raining and it took me six blocks to realize I didn't have my wipers on.

We pulled up to the school entrance.

"Nicky wait here."

I leaped out of the car before Nicky could question my actions.

I ran up to the glass double doors, pounding my fists in the rain.

*"HEY! IS THERE ANYBODY IN THERE!?"*

Nothing. I ran around the building towards the gymnasium. Locked. I was really starting to feel hopeless.  I noticed a window slightly ajar on the second story of the building.  I tried scaling the wall but the downpour made it impossible. Fuck this was so stupid.

It occurred to me that this really could just be a crazy coincidence. That my mother in-law was dying right now and I was here in the rain trying to break into an elementary school.

But then I noticed a tether ball stand. Held down by a weighted tire.

I ran over to it, flipped it on its side, and with all my might pushed it towards the base of where the window was. I got a good grip on it, and started to climb. If I could balance on the top, I should just be able to reach the windowsill. The rain made my hands slippery, but I just focused on Aki; on 'Baba'.  I felt a bellow of thunder rumble through the sky and knew my time was running out.

Just as I reached the top, I heard:

*"Daddy...! Daddy...!"*

Nicky was standing at the base of the tetherball pole. Clearly scared, drenched in the rain. I called out to him.

*"Wait right there! I'll be ba-"*

***BAM!*** ***A crack of blinding white light...*** and then total black.

I don't remember anything after that. Just some vague limbo of nothing.

I woke up laid up in a hospital bed. My body was aching all over. Craning my neck around I pieced together that I was in Mount Sinai Hospital in Queens. I had no idea how much time had passed. Nori and Nicky entered the room shortly after. My mind began to fill up with questions, but I was too weak to get them out. I just laid there in a daze. Nori started crying. Nicky stood like a statue, just staring at the floor. I felt like Lazarus, back from the dead.

The first question I managed to ask was if Aki was still with us.

She wasn't.

A nurse joined us and explained to me that I had been struck by lightning on that tetherball pole. They'd need to run some additional testing that evening. My family doesn't know yet but I am now suffering from electrical cardiomyopathy. AKA my heart is *fucked...*

As I write this, Nori and Nicky are asleep under the roof of our humble home...  
but I'm still here... I have no idea when I'll get out-

\-and the more I look into my condition, the more I wonder if I even will.

But this isn't the reason I'm sharing any of this is now. It's because of what just happened to me, only a couple hours ago now.

A man came into my room while I was sleeping, unannounced.

He looked like a Doctor, but didn't state himself as one.

Simply, he placed his hand over mine.

"Give it to someone you trust."

Then he left. I could feel a soft plastic object left behind in my palm, but it was too dark to see... when suddenly a little display lit up.

8-bit text floated across the bright screen:

"FAFA"

The text faded, leaving only my own bloodshot eyes gazing back at myself. Nicholas used to call me that.

I feel so lost right now. I feel so hopeless. I don't know what any of this means, or what I am supposed to do. If anyone has gone through something like this, or know someone who has, please tell me.

I feel so alone.

I don't want to die.

I love you Nori. I love you Nicholas.
