[As I frantically stumbled past my friends, my heart pounded in my chest, and I shouted at the top of my lungs, "RUN!!"](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14fh28u/when_she_trapped_us_in_that_pit_she_thought_she/) With adrenaline coursing through my veins, I sprinted past them and the monument, around the corner, and into the tunnel we had come through. At first, my friends stood there, confused, but not wanting to see what I had witnessed, they were soon right behind me.  

As we ran, the hallway seemed longer than before, and the statues appeared more spaced apart. Each statue we passed felt like a longer distance until the next. *Are my eyes playing tricks on me? No… the end is definitely farther than it was when we came in*. I glanced at the statues as I dashed past. *They’re more spaced apart now for sure. I think each statue we pass is getting to be a longer distance until the next*.  

I stopped for a moment to catch my breath and glanced behind us. The rest of the group stopped too, asking me in a frenzy what I had seen. "I, I don’t know, some animal, it was that monster. The statue we saw, except it was all dead and rotted and freaking disgusting!" I gasped for breath. 

"You mean you SAW IT? ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT THING IS COMING FOR US NOW?" Ryan whispered, wide-eyed with fear. "I don't know," I softly replied, as the reality of our situation sank in. The fact that we might all die down there became all too real. "The gun!" Tanner exclaimed. "Where's the gun!?" Panic ensued as we frantically searched for the gun in our backpacks. I ripped into the backpack I was carrying but it wasn’t there. *Please tell me someone picked it back up*. I looked up at the others who all had the same dumbfounded look as I did. Tanner facepalmed.   

In the background, the torches at the end of the hall flickered and then went out. “Guys” I pointed towards the flickering and could see it, moving in the darkness of the entrance. The torches next to the slumping figure went out each time it passed a set, and then the next set began flickering. Everyone froze, and we could hear the stomps of the monster's hooves hitting the ground, a loud \**thud, thud, thud*\* with each step. Coming from the beast, I could hear faint whispering, followed by an occasional snort. 

\**Thud, thud, thud, thud, thud*\*, the slow walking suddenly accelerated into a hastened chase. The torches where the beast was now at flickered for only a moment before extinguishing into the darkness. It was coming for us. "Get to the elevator!" I shouted, and we all resumed our sprint, but our running almost immediately proved to be futile. Panic gripped us as we exchanged terrified glances. The room was stretching as we ran, and it was taking longer and longer to reach the next torches in line. While it had only taken a couple of minutes to get about halfway between the entrance and the monument room, I knew we weren’t going to reach the end in time. 

*No no no no. We’re going to die, we’re going to die, we need to get out of here or we’re going to die!* "Open your backpack!" he said to me while suddenly stopping. *Damn it, he’s going to try and fight this thing straight out of Hell*. I stopped and ripped open the backpack. We rummaged through and everyone grabbed their weapons… I had the largest knife, Alice had the pepper spray, Tanner held the two knives like he was Rambo or something and Ryan had the bug spray.  

*Holy shit, we are* ***FUCKED***.  

Alice was clearly shaking. I looked down at my hands and gripped the knife more firmly with both hands. I was shaking too. “What the hell am I supposed to do with this? Give me a knife, Tanner!” Ryan said. “You’re supposed to use it with the lighter, idiot! You know, like a flamethrower!” Tanner responded. I handed Ryan the lighter, and he created an awkward stance to show that he was ready to go.  

“Come on!” Tanner shouted at the creature. *What has gotten into Tanner, first he was denying the reality of the situation and now he wants to get us all killed by trying to fight?* The minotaur slowed down just one set of torches away from us and came to a full stop. It was staring, whispering, its frame barely illuminated by the flickering torch. With how close it was, I could hear it as if hundreds of voices were speaking at once. I could pick out a few words in between strings of inaudible whispering murmurs as it glared at us with its single eye. 

“***Run… vessel of souls… save us… \*inaudible\*... ritual … abomination… escape this place… Micheal… \*inaudible\*... run… trapped… help us***”  

*Did it… did it just say my name?* I took a step back and almost stumbled. *It knows my name*. I looked at the others. “We can’t fight that thing. We have to try to run”. Tanner's face became stern as he argued we had to try to fight or else it would kill us. Suddenly, the beast charged at us. Without thinking, and just out of instinct, I started running as fast as I could back towards the elevator. 

I looked back to make sure the others were following, but they were all just standing there, unsure of what to do. And then Ryan and Alice realized the hopelessness of the situation, and they began running too. Tanner just stood there, mouth agape. "Hey!" his voice echoed through the tunnel behind me. A pang of guilt singed through me as I ran, but in the moment, the thought of leaving my friend for dead was only an afterthought. He was the one choosing to just stand there instead of running. He was the one choosing to stay behind. 

Running, running, almost to the elevator. Away from here, away from that thing. I desperately craved the reassurance that Tanner was right behind me, that we could all escape this nightmare together and make it out alive. "AAUUUUUUUUGGGGHHHH!!" A blood-curdling scream filled the air, and my heart sank as I knew that it was too late. Still running, I dared to look behind me and saw it was Alice screaming at the top of her lungs. Tanner was pointing a knife up at the nightmarish ghoul that now loomed directly before him. He was stiff, seemingly paralyzed. And then, the minotaur's massive hand wrapped around his arm, and Tanner screamed in agony as it was crushed. I could see his flashlight slip from his hand, dropping to the ground and going out. 

What I witnessed next was the most twisted and deranged thing I have ever seen. It was difficult to decipher, as the only view we had were short glances from the dim flickering of the torches. Two figures, locked in a desperate struggle, grappled with each other amidst the encroaching darkness. Their movements were frenzied and the flickering shadows distorted their forms. A gut-wrenching \**CRACK*\* pierced the air, like the sound of a fragile bone snapping under unimaginable force. The smaller figure slumped to the ground, crumpling like a discarded sack of sand. 

I then saw the smaller silhouette once again lifted as it was brought to the head of the larger silhouette. The whispers from before, their chilling pleas, suddenly transformed into nightmarish screams that shattered the air. Their desperate cries seemed to bounce off the walls, reverberating through me. “***ANOTHER ONE... SAVE US... \*coughing\*… RUN AWAY... \*inaudible\*… TANNER... ESCAPE NOW... HELP US... WE’RE TRAPPED...***” The large creature devoured Tanners body, flashes of his legs slightly kicking in the darkness as they disappeared. As soon as they were completely consumed, the shouting stopped and went back to whispers. 

I recoiled and picked up the pace. *Tanner’s dead. I've known him for years, what will we tell his family?* I finally made it to the elevator and shouted at the other two to run faster, as I could see the torches behind them dissipate into the darkness. They ran inside and slammed against the wall. I pressed the up button so that we could go back to floor six... but it wouldn’t press. It was stone in the wall, as the elevator had been before, refusing to budge. I looked down the hall, sweating, and the beast was close enough that I could see it charging us. I pressed the down arrow instead, pleading that it would work. \**Click*\* The elevator doors began closing, and I hysterically continued to press it, hoping that the doors would close faster. 

\**WHOOSH*\* I felt a swift rush of air past the left side of my head as something flew by. \**Clank*\* Dread washed over me as the elevator doors changed course from almost completely closed to suddenly reopening. Jammed into the center of the wall was now the massive metal pole of the minotaur, inches from my head. The pole was so long that it was protruding outside of the elevator and back into the hallway, stopping the set of doors from shutting. The minotaur had hurled it.  

I grabbed it and began yanking, but it was deeply lodged into the wall. "GUYS, HELP ME!" Ryan snapped out of his trance and grabbed onto the weapon, pulling with me. The wall made a cracking sound, and then the pole came loose, allowing us to throw it out of the elevator completely. "IT'S RIGHT THERE, IT'S RIGHT THERE!" Alice was screaming. I frantically clicked the down button again, and I heard the beast screech, perhaps only feet away, as the doors came to a shut. We all held our breaths as the elevator began descending. I was sweating, shaking. None of us spoke. Tanner was dead, and we all knew it. 

The elevator disturbed my thinking with its \**ding*\*, and the doors opened. At first, it was so dark that I couldn't tell what the area looked like, but I could feel a slight breeze and hear the sound of branches rustling. My eyes began to adjust, revealing the moon casting its radiant beams upon the landscape. We were outside.  

"Oh, thank God, thank God!" Alice said as she ran out and kneeled on the ground, feeling the grass. "We made it out! We're finally out!" she then said more softly. I gave a sigh of relief. *How is it already dark outside though? We weren't in there for more than a couple of hours*. I checked my phone. 3:24pm. *And still no cell reception. None of this makes sense.* I grabbed my flashlight and scanned the area while stepping out of the elevator. The ground mushed beneath my feet. It was incredibly foggy, and everything looked soaked as if it had just poured rain. I recognized this place. We were right next to the cave entrance. 

The air hung heavy with humidity. Shimmering moonlight reflected off the still grass, occasionally interrupted by a slight breeze which caused the terrain to glimmer further. Ryan pulled out his phone. "Still no reception. Let's get the hell out of here and call the police." He looked back at the elevator. Then he muttered, "Tanner." He paused. "Megan's going to rot in jail for this." I inspected the elevator top to bottom. It was just sitting there in the middle of the grass, and it certainly hadn't been there beforehand. "Yeah, let's get to the car," I said in reply. 

We began traveling down the trail we had come in on, each step making a small squish as we speed-walked. The trees looked different than beforehand. *I could've sworn they were all Douglas Firs and other evergreen trees. Now they all look bare and tilted.* The twisted branches reached toward the moon, forming eerie silhouettes against the night sky. Strands of moss, like spectral curtains, dangled from their limbs. Occasionally they swayed gently in the breeze. I found that I could point my flashlight almost anywhere in the woods and the ground would bounce light right off of it. We were completely surrounded by water.  

As we continued trudging on the trail, my knife still in my hand, we would occasionally have to dodge or jump over large puddles of water. We were all silent, focusing on walking as quickly as possible while also ensuring we didn’t trip and soak ourselves. “Do you guys think we could've saved him?” Alice asked. Neither Ryan nor I answered for a moment. A dragonfly flew a few feet in front of us. “I don’t know what that thing was, but you saw how massive it was. There was no way we were going to kill it. He... he should've run” I replied. She nodded her head, realizing it was a conversation that would need to wait for another time. My mind went back to picturing the beast we had discovered down there. The horns, the hooves, its features melting off of its face before our very eyes.  

An abrupt rustling of the trees behind us caused our heads to all dart in anxiety. We stopped and began to hold our breath. Our flashlights skimmed the trees back and forth but revealed nothing. After a few moments, we resumed with a faster pace. Every gust of wind and every fallen branch stepped on to a snap would shoot me with panic, terrified that it was still somehow after us. Ryan slowed down to match my pace and began to whisper to us both. “Hey guys, how are you holding up?” “What do you mean how am I holding up? One of my best friends tried to kill me and another best friend was just devoured by that deranged creature. I just want to go home.” Alice stayed silent. Ryan thought for a moment and then said “Me too. We’re almost out of this though, we can get back to the car and drive to the nearest police station. Maybe Tanner is still alive, and they can find him.” 

I could feel my face growing red as I resisted shouting at Ryan to shut up. Tanner was dead, maybe worse, and we weren't getting him back. I took a deep breath and tried to calm down. "Yeah, maybe." "When I was a kid, I would always be afraid of going on hikes because of how high up they'd go, and my mom would always tell me the same story to help me muster up the courage." *Oh great, we just watched our friend get eaten alive, and now Ryan wants to explain to me how to be brave.* "Once there was a young man, a warrior." I opened my mouth to try and cut him off, but he was talking too quickly because he was obviously scared out of his mind himself. "His mentor urged him to confront fear, but he was hesitant. His mentor insisted, imparting the instructions for the impending battle. The day arrived when the young man stood on one side, and fear loomed large on the other side." 

I was thinking about tuning him out but figured it was helping him feel a little better, and it was good for me to focus on something else. "He felt small and insignificant, while fear assumed an imposing and wrathful stance. Clutching their weapons, the young man steeled himself and approached fear. With utmost reverence, he prostrated before fear three times and respectfully asked, 'Might I have your permission to engage in this battle?' To his surprise, fear replied, 'Thank you for demonstrating such respect by seeking permission.' 

Encouraged by this response, the young man inquired, ‘How can I conquer you?’” Ryan stopped, and when I looked at him, he was looking at me as if he wanted me to guess what the answer was. I just shrugged my shoulders and glanced behind us again. “Fear answered ‘My weapons are the rapid flow of words and my ability to invade your personal space. By doing so, I aim to unsettle you completely, compelling you to obey my every command. However, I hold no power if you choose not to follow my directives.’ Pondering these words, the young man realized, ‘Although I may lend an ear to your words and treat them with respect, and even be swayed by them, I can render you powerless by simply refusing to yield’”.  

Great. “Nice” I replied. Obviously, I wasn’t in a talking mood and hoped that Ryan would get the hint. He began on again, huffing between every few words because of the mixture of walking and still being in shock. “I think the meaning is that we are the ones who cause the most fear in ourselves. Like we can control what we are afr-” “Will you shut up?” I shot at him. His face changed from seemingly on the verge of some great discovery to being taken aback. Alice’s face also turned sour, but I didn’t care. 

I pointed back towards the direction of the cave. “That thing killed our friend, not some wild part of our imagination! You know what? I am afraid, as I should be. We SHOULD be afraid because if we decide to not be afraid, we’re going to die!” Suddenly, there was another snap from a branch, but this time it was definitely behind us in the woods. I let out an audible gasp and spun around. Again, nothing. We waited. I had been hearing too many noises for it all to be the wind. I skimmed my flashlight between trees, but it was difficult to see anything with the fog. I continued staring, and then Ryan poked me in the side. I looked at him to see that he was pointing at the roots of a distant patch of trees. He leaned in close and barely whispered to me with a shaky voice, “The water”. 

I stared at the water and realized what he was talking about. Ripples coming from a single spot on the right of the tree patch. I gulped and shined my flashlight directly in that direction. The trees were so thick that all I could see were branches. I stared intently at them. One was standing out, different than the others. *That branch isn’t jagged, it looks curved. Like... a horn*. I continued staring, no longer willing to gamble looking away. *I have to be imagining it*. I held my hand up to the others, telling them not to move. One minute, two minutes, I continued waiting as still as I could possibly be. 

And then it moved. Just slightly, but I’ve never been so sure of something in my life. And it didn’t move with the wind, it moved all on its own. I widened my eyes in terror and whispered “RUN”. We all began sprinting as fast as possible, splashing through puddles and running into branches. I couldn’t tell if it was coming from my imagination or from the woods behind us, but I could hear the whispering now bouncing off of the trees. That awful whispering that was starting to drive me mad. Every muscle was beginning to become strained and burned, but we couldn't afford to slow down. 

*It’s starting to look familiar, maybe we’re getting close to the car.* I squinted my eyes, trying to adjust my vision and visualize our surroundings. *No. Oh God please no.* But there it was, staring us in the face. Just off the trail was the cave we had finally escaped from.  

“We just went in a giant circle!?” Alice screamed. But it didn’t matter. There was no time to figure it out, the Minotaur was right behind us. We all exchanged glances, unsure of what to do. *I’m not going back into that damn cave, but the only way out just brought us right back here.* “Come on!” I shouted while continuing on the trail. “We had to have taken a wrong turn!” I glanced again at the cave to see the elevator still sitting there. Temptation crept through me to get back in, like somehow going back in there would better than being outside. Like somehow going back into Hell would be better than staying out in the woods with the creature. But it would follow us back in, and I knew that.  

Moving through the trail a second time, I was hoping we would be able to outrun the beast now knowing the terrain. Now we could predict the turns, the puddles and the branches. That hope was quickly crushed. The trail we were traveling on, the same one we had been running down literally minutes before, was now completely flooded. Everything looked soaked, as if a torrential downpour had just occurred and somehow we hadn’t noticed. My run quickly diminished into a slow, awkward jog as every step I took was now engulfed in the mud. \**squish squish squish squish*\* The realization hit me that the creature would easily track us through the soggy ground, shattering any hope of losing it. With each loud step, my heart sank, knowing that our chances of outrunning it were dwindling further. 

After several more minutes of jogging, Ryan whispered between breaths that he needed to stop to avoid collapsing. We halted, our heavy panting muffled by the pressing silence. Listening intently for the chasing beast, we found no noise behind us. The forest enveloped us, shrouded in shadows that constantly dripped with water. As I bent over, hands on my knees, trying to catch a glimpse of the moon, my eyes met with two small, yellow eyes staring back at me. I jumped back with a gasp, my flashlight revealing a vulture perched nearby. 

I stood there frozen in place, afraid that the bird would jump at me with an attack, but it just stared. Seconds stretched on, as if time had slowed down and we were in a staring contest. A staring contest that felt like it would somehow mean the end of my life if I lost. The vulture slightly moved its feet, readjusting its stance with its razor-sharp talons. It wasn’t even blinking. “That thing is massive” Ryan muttered just behind me. I worried it was about to screech when it suddenly opened its mouth, but it made no noise. Its eyes stayed locked on me, and I sensed that it was filled with an insatiable hunger, and that it was hunting for its next meal. “Freaking creepy” he again whispered.  

A moment later, I flinched as it opened its enormous wings and flew directly over us into the trees. I looked around the tops of the trees and spotted another pair of yellow eyes, too far away to make out the body shape of. I moved my flashlight down the trail towards where we were heading and another vulture’s eyes shined back at me, just on the right. These things were everywhere. And they were all watching us.  

I felt a small sting on the side of my neck and swatted it. I then held my hand up to my face to confirm what it was. *Mosquito. I’ve been getting bit like crazy out here but haven’t even noticed until now. Funny how much I usually hate these little guys.* As we continued on the path, the journey became unbearably slow. The ground was soaked, making each step in the mud a struggle. It took strength every time I lifted one leg out of the mud and moved it forward, and I would’ve lost my balance straight into the mush if I hadn’t decided to grab a walking stick. 

After about 15 minutes of walking, we encountered a puddle that was more like a small lake, stretching far into the trees and blocking our route. I looked back at the other two to see if they had any other ideas and they looked completely clueless, so I took a few steps in. Cold water rushed through my pants drenching me up to the knee. Each step was becoming more difficult than the last, and I could tell that by the time we walked halfway through we would be swimming. 

I turned around and told them we wouldn’t be able to cross. “What are we going to do then?” Ryan asked. I looked at Alice, who started to explain that we may be able to go off the trail a bit to stay in the shallower portion of the area, when suddenly I heard a large \**splash*\* behind me. I jumped and started running out of the water while turning around to see the danger. All three of us pointed our lights towards the source, which had come seemingly come from the other side of the pool, but at first we saw nothing. And then I saw them. A pair of yellow eyes reflected light back at us, and it took no difficulty to tell that they were the eyes of a crocodile.  

We stood frozen in fear as the realization sank in that we were not alone in this murky water. “No no nooooooooo” Alice whimpered. The crocodile stayed submerged, only its eyes visible above the surface, fixated on us with a predatory stare. Panic began to once again set in as I frantically searched for another way out. There was no way we could turn back, and now we couldn’t move forward. Now death was blocking us from both directions.  

In a hushed tone, I suggested we try to make our way around the edge of the water, perhaps find a narrow point to cross without getting close to the lurking crocodile. The other two didn’t respond for a moment. Ryan then looked at Alice, grabbed both of her hands, and whispered “I won’t let anything happen to you”. After a hug she ooked at him and nodded her head, and then he looked at me and nodded his. Slowly and cautiously, we went left and began edging along the shore, our eyes never leaving the ominous gaze of the hidden predator. Each step felt like an eternity, and the waterlogged ground made it even more treacherous. The water was getting deeper as we moved through the tree limbs, trying to decipher how to weave between everything.  

As we continued, it became apparent that the crocodile was tracking our movements beneath the water. Its eyes followed our every step. I watched the surrounding water closely. *If there’s one there is sure to be many. What the hell happened here, how did this place go from pretty woods to a freakish swamp?* I stopped. “What is it?” Ryan asked. I didn’t answer him. *Swamp. The elevator said the next floor would be a swamp.* I looked around in shock as the truth began to settle in. I tilted my head up to the night sky. Stars filled the eternal darkness, the moon still casting a blanket of soft light upon us. *The moon... It hasn’t moved since we came out of the elevator. We're not out. We're not outside.* 

\**SPLASH*\*  

Without warning, the tranquility shattered with a loud splash, and Alison was yanked into the water. Ryan leaped after her, his hands flailing in the murky depths, attempting to free her from whatever sinister grip had ensnared her. My heart pounded in my chest as I tossed my knife to Ryan. I then quickly held out my walking stick, reaching out to her, and I could see her hands thrashing in the air, sending splashes cascading around us. Ryan was stabbing at something in the water, and I couldn’t see it until I pulled with all of my might and was able to pull Alice towards me for a moment. Grabbing her foot was a large, hairy arm coming from beneath the surface. [An arm that was covered in rotting, peeling flesh.](https://www.reddit.com/user/UnderdonetoastHorror)
