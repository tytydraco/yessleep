It has been a long time since I thought about these things, but I think starting with the Merrow was the right choice. They were dangerous, sure, but for the most part, they didn't interact with us much. I think it's time I told another story, this time, though, I think I'll go into one of the things that sent me to the hospital.

Normally, when you're sailing one of the big things you want to do is avoid storms. They can cause unnecessary damage to your ship or even kill members of the crew. When I was in the military we never ran into a storm, high-tech sonar and weather monitoring equipment made the chances of that happening slim. The same goes for my time on cruises, really. We'd sail around them and the passengers would be none the wiser. So, it wasn't until I started working on smaller cargo and fishing ships that I learned about hellclouds.

Nobody really knows what causes them, but they always seem to appear near storms. To most, they look like fog resting atop the waves, but I've learned differently. I know what's in Hellclouds.

The first few times I encountered them, it wasn't anything crazy. We were inside and getting ready to bunk down for the night when the pa sounded.

"Alright boys, dog down all hatches and stay inside. Looks like we have to go through a Hellcloud."

Those who were more seasoned on these smaller boats quickly ran to all of the doors and locked the hatches down tight, placing a piece of steel on the handle to prevent it from turning. I watched with morbid curiosity as they scurried about like ants, dutifully sealing the inside of the ship off and covering all of the portholes. When they finally finished I took the chance to ask one of the saltier sailors what the hell was going on.

"You'll see soon enough. Thought you'd been sailing a while, never been through a Hellcloud?" 

I shook my head "Been on a lot of bigger ships, don't ever remember going through one of these."

He nodded, "Bigger ships have fancy navigation, usually able to avoid storms and Hellclouds without too much issue." We talked for a little longer, sharing some sea stories to pass the time, but then, things got eerie. The sound of the waves lapping against our fishing boat suddenly disappeared and everything was silent. I looked to the older sailor and he gave me a solemn nod. "Keep quiet. Don't draw their ire."

Suddenly the world exploded, cacophonous agonized screams and horrid roaring echoed across the deck. I could hear heavy breaths as something moved outside, within moments it was at the hatch, jiggling it in an attempt to open the door, to expose us to the nightmare outside. The jiggling stopped and something heavy banged against the steel, letting loose a low throaty growl. I jumped in shock, but the other guy grabbed me and raised a finger to his lips. The banging continued, and the screaming grew louder as the ship began to rock and shake. It was like being in some of the choppiest waters I had ever experienced.

I've never gotten seasick, never even come close, but that night when I first went through that cloud I nearly puked. Soon, the pounding ceased and the screaming began to fade. The churning waters stopped tossing our boat and everything seemed to calm down. We unlocked the hatches and checked outside for damage to the boat. There were dents in the deck and on the hatch, but things were otherwise fine. I breathed a sigh of relief and spoke to the other sailor after we had made sure things were still in working order.

"Yeah, Hellclouds are weird. Lot of guys think they're portals to other dimensions. Heard stories about ships that get caught in Hellclouds. When the clouds disappear, so do the ships. Bermuda Triangle's got a lot of 'em. All I know for sure? You don't want to get caught outside in one. You seen the door." he murmured, motioning to the dented hatch.

​I went through seven Hellclouds on that boat. None of them were exactly the same. Some were short, five minutes, others we were harassed for hours while strange creatures tried to claw their way into the ship. Every time the damage to the ship was minimal, and every time we just got back to things like nothing happened.

Until something did.

We were sailing somewhere in the Atlantic and I was on deck with another deckhand, Gregg, and we were finishing up the late shift. Things suddenly got really quiet and the captain frantically came on the PA "HELLCLOUD! SEAL THE SHIP NOW!" Gregg and I exchanged a glance before we bolted for the hatch, but it was too late. The door had been sealed. I felt my stomach sink, and when I looked over to Gregg I could see the color in his face was gone. We were outside. We were outside in a Hellcloud.

​The anguished roar of a thousand voices dropped me to my knees, my hands shot to my ears and I wanted to scream in pain, but I couldn't. Weakly, I looked to Gregg, he was in the same position. We knelt there covering our ears as the screams echoed deafeningly all around us, my head swam and my vision clouded. I could feel the blood pooling in my clenched hands, and then there were stars.

My vision was rocked with a bright light as intense pressure sent me flying into the wall of the boat. Even through the screams, I could hear the thing growling, but as I opened my eyes I saw nothing. Within moments of colliding with the hull, I felt myself leaving the ground. I heard the low growl of the creature again as my body was racked with white-hot pain, cooled only by a warm trickle of what I could imagine was my blood. I gasped, hands beating desperately at something I couldn't see, but there was no relief. I squirmed, screamed, and fought. There was no solace, only agony as I felt my body being torn to shreds.

Blacking out was a mercy.

​I was airlifted to the nearest hospital, and that night I died for four minutes. I spent two months recovering from the mauling I experienced, doctors had no explanation for what happened, it wasn't like lions or bears just roamed the ocean. Eventually, it was chalked up to falling overboard and being attacked by wildlife, they never delved deeper than that. Gregg was injured, but he was able to recover within a few weeks, sadly the ordeal cost him his eye.

For me? Two fingers, and a foot. I'm also now partially deaf. I still consider it a blessing that I survived. Apparently, we were in the cloud for six minutes, which means I was beaten for six minutes and I survived.

I spent around six months on land, doing jobs in docks and fish markets, but I couldn't stand it. Everything about shore life felt empty. After that time I went back out, because even Hellclouds weren't what finally broke me.
