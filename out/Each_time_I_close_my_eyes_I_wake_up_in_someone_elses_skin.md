It’s never peaceful. Never quiet. 

I can’t tell where they end, and I begin. 

The bodies I wake in—no, the bodies I steal—are never the same.

Once, I woke as a man mid-sneeze in the middle of a drive-thru. One moment, he’s ordering a triple bacon cheeseburger with extra pickles; the next, he jerks violently, launching a glob of mucus onto the cashier’s outstretched hand. She screamed. He screamed. I screamed. His shame was palpable, his thoughts scrambling for an apology, but I was already gone—laughing and horrified.

Once, I woke in the body of a taxidermist, hunched over a squirrel, or what had once been one. Its glass eyes stared back at me, unblinking, as I realized his—my—hands were stitching human hair onto the lifeless creature. The workshop—a twisted gallery of unfinished horrors: a deer with baby teeth, a fox with a human ear sewn to its neck. He—I—was giggling. The hysterical laughter made my skin crawl, even though it was my own voice.

Once, I woke in the body of a man buried alive. The air thick with dirt and rot. Fingers clawed at the coffin’s lid, splintering nails, blood smearing the wood. Memories surged: an unforgiving debt and pitiless faces of those who had nailed him in. Every breath a battle, every second a descent into darkness. 

I’ve stopped trying to make sense of it. There’s no pattern, no logic. Sometimes there is only pain.

But last night… 

Last night, I woke up in my son’s body.

I knew it the moment I opened my eyes. His room was dark. Posters—the ones I helped him hang—were right where they’d always been. The air was heavy with the sharp citrus tang of the cologne I’d given him on his last birthday. His mattress cradled me. And his voice was still there. 

It didn’t fade.

„Dad? What’s happening? Why can’t I move?”

I bolted upright, my hands—his hands—scraping. I lunged for the mirror. There he was, staring back. My breath caught in his throat, and the scream that tore wasn’t mine. It was his. 

And then I saw it.

His desk was empty, except for a single object: a bottle of pills. Beside it, a hastily scrawled note read, 

“I’m sorry” 

My vision blurred, the acrid taste of something bitter coating my tongue. Throat convulsed, his chest heaving, and I felt the nauseating wave of chemicals surging through his veins—through mine. My son’s voice wailed inside, a keening cry of fear and regret.

„Dad, I don’t want it! It was a mistake! Help me!”

I tried to claw my way out, to get to his room, and call for an ambulance.. but the force that bound me here wouldn’t let go this time. 

Limbs twitched, as his—our—heartbeat slowed, every pulse weaker than the last. My screams joined his, a cacophony trapped in the vessel of my only child. The darkness crept in, suffocating and final. 

I realized the cruelest truth: the force that threw me from body to body had never been mine. 

It was feeding. 

On us. 

On me. 

And it wasn’t done yet.
