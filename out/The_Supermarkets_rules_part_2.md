As I caught my breath and the figure faded back into the shadows, I knew that my encounter with the unknown was far from over. My heart raced, and a cold sweat clung to my skin. I couldn't simply ignore the rest of the rules now; I had to know what I was up against. Swallowing my fear, I resumed reading from where I left off.

And there it was, Rule 100: "If you see a locked door with a rusty handle in aisle 13, cut your finger with something sharp and put blood where the key would belong, inside aisle 13 is a floating head  but do not worry, he has bad sight, just turn all lights off and sneak near him, after that, you'll find yourself in a room painted blood red, in that room there is a pool of red liquid, but DO NOT TOUCH IT, instead, sweep it away with a broom and you'll get a wooden cross, only use the wooden cross when you're in extreme danger, i warned you."

My heart pounded in my chest as I read the bizarre instructions. It sounded like something out of a nightmare, and yet, I knew I had to face it. The locked door held secrets that might hold the key to surviving this ordeal. But the thought of cutting my finger and dealing with a floating head monster sent shivers down my spine.

I glanced around, the store's aisles stretching out before me in an eerie silence. The temptation to leave the rules behind and flee was strong, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was already too deep into this nightmare. Taking a deep breath, I took out my pocket knife, hesitating for a moment before drawing it across my finger.

As the blood welled up, I pressed my finger against the rusty handle of the locked door. With a creak, it swung open, revealing a darkness that seemed to swallow the light around it. Steeling myself, I entered, my heart pounding in my ears.

Inside, I fumbled for the light switch and turned it off, plunging the space into complete darkness. Fear gnawed at me, but I remembered the rule about the floating head's poor sight. I moved as quietly as possible, my heart racing in time with my footsteps.

And then, I heard itâ€”the faint sound of a whispering wind, like the rustling of leaves. I froze, my breath catching in my throat. A shape loomed ahead, barely visible in the darkness. The floating head monster.

With bated breath, I edged closer, my steps deliberate and slow. The creature's head twitched, its gaze shifting erratically. I held my breath, praying that the rule was accurate.

As I tiptoed past the creature, I felt a gust of air as it exhaled, its breath ruffling my hair. The tension was suffocating, but I made it to the other side without incident. I reached for the light switch and flicked it on, revealing a new room painted in blood red.

A pool of crimson liquid dominated the center, but I heeded the rule's warning and kept my distance. Instead, I grabbed a nearby broom and carefully swept the liquid away. At the bottom of the now-clear space, a cross sparkled.

With trembling hands, I picked it up, the cool surface sending a shiver down my spine. This cross, according to the rule, was my lifeline in times of extreme danger. I couldn't even fathom the horrors it might protect me from.

Leaving the room, I locked the door behind me and retreated into the main store. The rules had led me on a bizarre and terrifying journey, but at least now I had something tangible, something that might tip the scales in my favor when faced with whatever other horrors this supermarket held.

I pocketed the cross, the weight of it a constant reminder of the dangers that surrounded me. The supermarket was no longer just a place to guard; it had become a twisted labyrinth of supernatural terrors. With each step, I felt the walls closing in, the sense of being watched growing stronger.

As I ventured back into the security room, I checked the cameras, and the lights started flickering. Not remembering the rule, I stared at the camera. At some point, I noticed that I was paralyzed; I couldn't move an inch. I remembered the rule, but it was too late.

A dark, shadowy figure appeared on the camera and stared for a moment before lunging at it, destroying the camera. I had no idea what to do. A few seconds later, I was able to move again. I thought of hiding somewhere, but the security room wasn't a good hiding spot. I was about to open the door when I noticed the figure looking at me through the security room window. It started pounding on the door relentlessly.

In a rush, I placed a chair as a barricade against the door. However, I was sure it wouldn't hold up for long. Scanning my surroundings, I spotted an emergency axe. Just as the door burst into pieces and the chair went flying, panic surged through me. The monster entered the room, and my instincts kicked in. I grabbed the cross from my pocket and displayed it to the monster. It let out a painful scream, and the cross slipped out of my hand, landing near the monster. Suddenly, a blue hand emerged from the floor, snatching the cross and dragging it down along with the monster. 

I checked my watch, 12:12 AM. But I was convinced it had already been 3 AM. Was time moving backward? The situation grew more surreal by the minute, and I knew I had to find a way out of this before I became yet another victim of the supermarket's nightmarish secrets.
