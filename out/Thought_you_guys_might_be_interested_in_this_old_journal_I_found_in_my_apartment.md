Hi guys, not sure if this is the right place for it, but I thought that if anyone would be interested in my story, then it would probably be the people here.

So I moved into a new place recently. It's a pretty good spot, nice and quiet, and right on the edge of the City. The rent's really decent as well, especially for a newly renovated apartment in this area of London. 

Apparently, the building's been around for ages, and the location isn't super ideal for a lot of people, so they had to keep the rent low. No complaints from me though; I don't have a car, and I can cycle pretty easily to the nearby station.

Moving in was straightforward enough, and I'm pretty satisfied with the place so far. 

Here's where it gets weird. 

Shortly after settling in, I noticed that a patch of loose carpet, right at the threshold between where the bedroom connects to the living room. Now normally I would have just called the landlord to fix it up, but it didn't seem like a big deal at the time. Thought I'd take care of it myself-- save some cash in process, right?

Upon looking at the carpet more closely, I found something a bit unusual. There was a little gap where the carpet seemed to sag. 

When I pulled the carpet back, I found a little patch, no wider than my fist, where it looked like the floorboard had decayed, revealing the subfloor beneath. It was a bit like poking a hole in the top layer of foil on one of those pre-packaged meals-- a little peephole revealing everything that was underneath.

I'm a pretty curious guy by nature, so I couldn't help but shine a torch in there to have a quick peek. I wasn't expecting much. But to my surprise, right beneath the hole, there sat an unassuming little object-- a squarish shape which barely stood out amongst the dust, dirt, and mould. When I first saw it, I thought it was a tablet-- an iPad or a kindle or something. 

With a coat-hanger, some mounting tape, and a lot of patience, I eventually managed to fish it out. 

Out in the light, I could see that it was, in fact, not an iPad (like I had hoped), but a little hardcover bound book. Though the exterior was essentially eaten away by a blackish mould, I could still make out a single word, impressed against the faded red cover: JOURNAL.

Inside, the pages were in pretty bad shape. The first half of the journal was irretrievable-- mould stained and practically crumbling to the touch, I could barely leaf through them without causing irreversible damage. 

The back half wasn't much better, with a good portion of it torn out or (strangely enough) burnt. In addition, a lot of the writing itself was illegible; either crossed out, faded, or too frantically scrawled to comprehend. 

Around the margins and in the spaces between the words, I could make out strange sketches-- shapes and figures which are hard to describe. I'll see if I can upload some photos later.

The contents are... unusual, if not a little disturbing. It's a little disparate, because of how much of the text was unreadable, but I've transcribed the parts I could make out, and ordered them chronologically here. 


Let me know what you guys think.

**JOURNAL ENTRIES:**

&#x200B;

*Monday. April 4. 1893.*
___

Recently, I’ve been feeling unwell.

Upon returning from my latest trip to the East, I’ve found that my whole body aches, and I am constantly stricken by bouts of weakness and fatigue. I cannot stand for long, as the world spins when I am upright.

Most concerningly, I seem to be experiencing hallucinations—strange visual distortions which addle both my balance and my perception of depth. Strangely enough, I no longer dream.

Doctors have attributed it to an exotic ailment; exposure to miasmas, a viral disease, an insect bite. The source varies with each practitioner I meet.

I do not know when this started. I do not recall the reason I went to Asia.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;


*Friday. April 29. 1893.*
___

The symptoms have descended upon me quickly, like a fog. In addition, my recollection has become hazy as well—I am unable to recall what it feels to be without malaise. I have no recollection of my travels now. If it were not for this journal, I would not have known I travelled at all.

The doctors attribute this state of being to a range of ailments—it differs with every visit. Bilious fever, ague; illnesses of the ears, eyes, and brain; even hormonal imbalances caused by states of panophobia and neurosis.

Yet, the tests have been fruitless. Physically, my body is not inconsistent with the body of a perfectly healthy human being. At this point, I care little about the cause. The symptoms are all I experience, and brief respite from these afflictions is my only desire.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;



*Wednesday. June 15. 1893.*
___

As my condition worsens, more unique symptoms have begun to surface.

In the past, I have written in my journal to distract myself from the turbulent environment around me. But now, when I put pen to paper, I have been unable to conjure neither the words nor images necessary to describe my past experience. I can only focus on my present state, of the world which appears before my sensations in the here and now. 

In the future, I might look back to these entries, and recall this affliction which had ailed me for so long. 

But I am doubtful. Thoughts of the future are becoming hazy also.

*Sunday. June 19. 1893.*
___

These visions, they have only grown in vividness and intensity. No longer are they simple distortions of shape and colour in ordinary objects—now, entirely new objects have emerged.

Like balloon animals being inflated, thin figures billow outwards, creating uneven, grotesque forms. Almost always, they are bulbous, organic things, bulging and pulsating before my eyes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;



*Day uncertain. July 2. 1893.*
___

As I grow more accustomed to these visions, their features become more distinguished. What once were just vague, opaque blobs have now become sharply defined substances, or perhaps even organisms of sorts.

Perhaps, even flora.

Although they vary greatly in shape, colour, and size, it is clear that there exists a certain resemblance between some more than others. It is possible they even belong to specific and distinct genera.

But enough of this. To categorise hallucinations, like they were some undiscovered zoological species, is an act that even my addled mind can recognize as insanity.

*July 1893.*
___

They have begun moving now. Soundlessly, they creep across my sightline—some locomoting like caterpillars, while others slink on wireframe “feet”. These feet, thin feelers reminiscent of ant antennae, poke and probe the ground ahead, as if searching for stable ground. Dozens of these feelers extend from below their “bodies”; globular, ovoid masses, which appear as smooth as they are pliant.

Others sit upon stems, like detached eyes, floating in place.

On more than one occasion, I have seen small ones collide, merge, and become one entity.

Some of the larger ones, in fact, appear as a collection of small globules—orbs upon its body so numerous that it simulates fur. I can only wonder if they are a singular organism, or simply a congregation of them moving as one.

In these pages, I see that I have once referred to them as flora. I now see that this was an error. Yet neither are they fauna—they are a sort of combination: not quite animal, not quite plant.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;



*July? 1893.*
___

They are everywhere. I have seen them creep across my page, I have seen them loom outside my window. 

They are not visions—I have reached out and touched them. 

The one I felt was chewing-gum coloured—it was warm and fleshy to the touch.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;



*1893?*
___

Perhaps they have always been there. Silent, numerous, invisible to the human eye.

Perhaps my affliction is not illness, but insight. I have gained access to a world truer than our own. 

But this is no blessing. To watch and feel these things creep over my body, pulse on my bed, cast shadows over my building—it is something no man should see.

&#x200B;

*Date uncertain.*
___

I awoke with one in my mouth. It crawled out so easily, as mundane as a labourer leaving their family home for work. It left a slick and pungent trail behind it. Tastes like gasoline.

How long had it resided within me? How many of these creatures had I unknowingly ingested in my lifetime? My throat burns as I retch. 

Amongst the remains of my last meal, things shift and slither.

I don’t know how much more of this I can take.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;



*Date uncertain.*
___

To my family, if I had one, please burn this diary if you were to ever find it. I would do it myself, but I fear to exit my drawing-room. In fact, I am no longer able to stand at all. Fixed to my writing chair, I can only scrawl upon this page, gaze out my window, and watch the world become unrecognisable before my eyes.

I see them.

Even when I close my eyes, I see them.

They live beneath my eyelids, beneath my skin.

I fear that they see me.
