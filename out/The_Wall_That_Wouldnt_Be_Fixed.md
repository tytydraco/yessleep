They say when you buy an old house, you’re not buying the structure; you’re buying its history. I bought mine last spring, a crumbling 1920s bungalow that had been vacant for five years. I’m a carpenter by trade, so the plan was simple: demo, restore, and flip. I figured a few months of sweat equity would make me a tidy profit.

I started with the master bedroom. It was basic, except for a strange, narrow chimney breast that protruded a foot from the main wall. It looked like it had been plastered over dozens of times, thicker than the rest of the lath-and-plaster. It felt...dense.

The first few weeks were easy to dismiss. Tools would disappear—a hammer under a tarp, a tape measure on a ledger board—only to reappear later on the workbench. It was frustrating, but I was usually alone, running on four hours of sleep and inhaling plaster dust. I blamed myself. Fatigue, memory gaps, whatever.

Then the noises started. Not the thumps you expect from a settling house, but a precise, rhythmic tapping. It always came from behind that thick chimney breast, and it only happened after the generator was shut off and the sun was fully down. Tap-tap-tap-tap. Like a steady drip, but metallic.

The first time I finally knocked through the plaster, I expected to find a bricked-up flue. What I found instead was a sealed, airless void containing only dust and a small, smooth river stone—the kind a child would collect on a beach. It was cold to the touch, and when I took it out, the tapping instantly stopped. The silence felt heavier than the noise ever did.

I tried to ignore it. I spent a full week tearing out the old sheathing and gutting the room, leaving the chimney breast exposed down to the studs. I had a new run of electrical wire to pull through that space, but every time I got near it, the temperature would drop five degrees. My skin felt tight. The hairs on my arms would stand up, but not from the cold—it was like standing near a static charge.

One evening, I forced myself to work past 11 PM. I had to insulate and drywall the chimney breast or the job would fall behind. I cut the insulation, jammed it into the cavity, and prepared the first sheet of drywall.

As I lifted the sheet, a sound filled the air that made me drop my tools. It was a single, sustained whisper, right beside my ear. It wasn't loud, and I couldn't make out the words, but the tone was pure, infantile fury.

I bolted.

The next day, I came back with my friend, who worked as my weekend help. I didn’t tell him what happened; I just told him to hang the drywall on that specific chimney breast. He was halfway through screwing it into the studs when he suddenly stopped.

“Hey, Mark? Did you hear that?”

“Hear what?” I asked, pretending to clean a brush.

“Scratching,” he said, looking over his shoulder at the newly hung sheet. “It sounded like... sand on glass. Inside the wall.”

I told him it was just the insulation settling. He shrugged, finished the job, and left.

Now, the master bedroom is pristine. The floors are done, the paint is dry, and the new wall is flawlessly smooth. The house is ready for sale. The only problem is the scratching.

It doesn’t tap anymore. It drags. Slow, deliberate sounds of something with sharp edges being pulled across the back of the drywall. It happens all night now, right where the chimney breast is, behind a wall I made smooth and white.

It's resisting the final layer of paint. I’ll walk into the room in the morning, and there will be tiny, microscopic scuffs in the paint, as if something has been feeling its way around the inside perimeter of the drywall sheet.

I can’t fix it. I think the ghost was trying to get out when the wall was open. Now, by trying to make the house perfect, I just made a perfect coffin.

And tonight, I heard a new sound, quiet and close. It wasn't tapping, scratching, or fury. It was the sound of a small, sharp object slowly boring into the plaster, maybe an inch away from the surface.

I'm leaving the house tomorrow. I’ll take a loss. I just need to get out before whatever I sealed in there finally gets through.
