5 days a week. 8 hours a day. I get paid to pull the hairs. Down in the tunnels, far below the city, they grow in clumps. “I don't pay you to ask questions” is what my boss told me on day one. Seemed fair enough, the pay was good, and what I was doing didn't seem particularly harmful. 

Before work every day I would put on the suit, the boots, the oxygen mask, grab the equipment, and journey down into the tunnels to pull hair. When you first get in, it seems like a normal tunnel system, like one that'd lead to a subway system. 

But all that it led to was more corridors, miles and miles of branching concrete pathways leading nowhere but back into each other. It's an anxious feeling, hearing the sound of rushing cars on the highway above, completely isolated in the dark tunnels in a heavy suit. 

I was comforted a few weeks into the job by sneaking my phone into my suit to listen to podcasts, something they said I wasn't allowed to do. “for your own safety, you should hear” my boss would say. 

Partways in, after about 5 minutes of walking, all sound and air from the outside world was suddenly cut off, and I'd have to put on my mask. It was impossibly dark, and incredibly lonely. 

It was at this depth that you'd start to see the bristles, little black strands of hair poking out of the floor, walls and ceiling. They wouldn't move much, only twitching and jittering slightly as you touched them. Unsettling as they may be, they're nothing to worry about. 

Though one time I recall failing to put on my gloves before getting to that depth, and curiously touching one of the bristles. Big mistake, I couldn't get the hair out of my finger for months. The guys gave me shit for it, calling me “pube finger”. 

At least my case wasn't as bad as “dog boy”, the poor kid never showed up to work again. Occasionally the bristles would need shaving, but that wasn't my job, I still had a ways to go. At some point I'd reach a stairwell, and the bristles would increase in length and frequency. 

As the hairs increased in size, so did their movement. They twirled and wriggled weakly, making soft scraping noises as they brushed against the concrete and each other. 

This point would always make my own hair stand on end, something about the millions of tiny strands moving on their own deeply unsettled me. I would usually pick up my pace to get through this portion of the tunnels, as my job still lay further down. 

I once spoke with Dale, someone who's position lies in this portion of the tunnels. He said he got a strange satisfaction from yanking those squirming hairs from where they grew. And though I wouldn't personally call my job “satisfying”, it wasn't hard to understand what he was talking about. 

After a few turns, left, right, down, left again, I'd reach another stairwell. Only a few more floors to go. It was at this point that it became difficult to walk. The hairs were long enough to the point that they'd tangle and catch your legs, and trip you if you weren't careful. 

They were perhaps too big to move properly, erratic squirming and wriggling was now reduced to light and meagre jolts and jitters. The hairs coiled on the ground and draped from the ceiling, the concrete they sprouted from almost unseeable. 

Trudging through thick clumps of incredibly sturdy strands of hair, it's easy to get a little frustrated. I remember one time, my first day actually, I tripped and fell flat into the hair. 

I panicked and writhed as the hairs seemed to instinctively wrap around my body, pinning me to the ground. Luckily we have tools to deal with such situations. This was definitely my least favorite part of the tunnels. 

Determined to reach the end, I'd make one final push, and finally reach the last stretch. One more stairway down, I had finally reached my destination, and could begin my work. At this point in the tunnels, the space opened up into a wide open room, with pillars rising to the ceiling. 

The hair, now too big to move, dangled from the ceiling in long, thick ropes, and pooled in an ocean on the floor. I would spend the next few hours grabbing as much hair as I could, and yanking hard. It would strain and struggle, fused to the concrete. 

I had gotten so good that I only needed to wrap some around my arm, and pull as hard as I could to yank huge clumps of hair down from the ceiling, and stuff it into a large bag. I'd nearly break my back bending over and pulling it from the floor as well. 

I would then begin the fifteen minute walk back up the complex of hallways and stairwells, dumping all the hair into the truck, then journeying back down to pull more hair. It was strenuous, and I'd come home fatigued, but it's good exercise I guess. 

It was easy to get lonely all the way down there, though I can't say I'd be happy to meet another person there. Which is why my most recent shift has seriously disturbed me. 

As I was stuffing the last bag full of hair, and ready to leave the tunnels for the day, I heard someone talking. I took my earbuds out, and turned off my phone to make sure I wasn't hearing things. 

Sure enough, further into the darkness, beyond my line of work, I heard the sound of a man mumbling to himself. “Hello?” I called out. Though my voice was muffled by the mask, they definitely heard me, as their speaking stopped immediately after. 

I was hesitant to check out the source of the voice, as the sound emanated further down in the tunnels then I was instructed to go. To my knowledge, I had four coworkers who worked in these tunnels at alternating times, each with our own assigned layer. 

Dale, George and Isaac worked on the layers above mine. I talked with them often, we joked and theorized about our own job, about how weird it was and how we could possibly get paid so much when it didn't seem like we were doing anything. 

I feel like they've become good friends of mine in my time working here. Henry, who worked in the layer just below mine, didn't speak to anyone. I only recently found out his name. 

I suspected the voice I heard down there might be his, who else could it be? “Under no circumstances, should any of you be in the tunnels at the same time” my boss told me. 

I could have just left, but I wanted to make sure Henry wasn't occupying the same space when we were strictly told not to. I trudged through the thick hair, and walked further into the tunnel than I had ever bothered to go before. 

Leaving the wide open room, it lead into a circular tunnel, unlike anything I've seen before. What was most odd was the further down the tunnel I went, the length and frequency of the growing hair began to shrink, and disappeared completely. 

It was now simply a dark, echoey concrete tunnel, hairless, I suppose like a tunnel should be. After minutes of walking through the straight, barren tunnel, I heard the mumbling again. 

I saw him, standing in the dark, speaking to nobody. “How about we snap you in fucking half? I don't care. It's not like you need to be alive anyway.” He spat feverishly, facing away from me.

“Are… you talking to me?” I asked.
“OF COURSE I'M-” Henry whipped around and screamed, before his face relaxed upon seeing me. “Oh. You. I thought you were… someone else.” He whispered. I winced upon his sudden outburst. 

I then raised an eyebrow at his presence in this tunnel. Strangely, he wasn't wearing a suit, nor did he carry anything with him. He also looked strained, like one of the veins in his forehead would burst at any moment. 

“Are you supposed to be down here?” I inquired. Henry closed his drooling mouth and straightened up.
“Nobody is.” He said solemnly. After an awkward silence, he began moving towards me, then walked right by. 

I followed after, the two of us wordlessly trekking back up through the tunnels of hair. Freakishly, though Henry wore no suit, the hairs didn't seem to stick to him like they normally should. 

As he walked by, they avoided him like the same side of a magnet, pushing away with every step and movement. I didn't say a signal word the whole way out, I didn't get paid to ask questions. 

We stepped out into the sun, and I loaded the last bag into the truck. Henry just stood there, staring out into the sky. I took off all my equipment and walked over to him.
“You alright?” I questioned. Henry turned to me slowly, his expression gaunt and aged.

“I remember, when I was in my early twenties, I was freaking out over my hair.” Henry began, rubbing his bald head with his hand. “I was losing all my hair, and I hated it. I hated everyone and everything. It's hard to say going bald was the reason for that, but it's definitely what I fixated on.” 
I listened intently to Henry's story, fascinated because I had never heard him speak before. “I even tried killing myself one night, over my hair! Isn't that ridiculous!?” Henry admitted. 

I didn't know what to say, I just nodded. Henry's face soured, maybe realizing he shared too much. He then walked over to the truck and rested his hands on it. “Anyway, it's been a long day, you should take this with you.” 

Henry reeled back his head, and I heard a low tremble. His whole body began to violently shake, and his eyes rolled into the back of his head. I took a step back nervously as he began to gurgle and howl, his skin turning red. 

All at once, he heaved forward and an impossible amount of hair began shooting out of his mouth like a cascade. Meters and meters and meters and meters of thick black hair flew out from his throat and coiled in the back of the truck. 

My jaw nearly hit the floor watching the scene, a disgusting waterfall of hair streaming without cease. After a full minute of Henry convulsing, puking up hundreds of pounds of hair into the truck. 

He stopped. He wiped his mouth, said “see ya”, then left. I anxiously returned to base with the hull. The boss didn't question the unprecedented amount of hair I had come back with. 

If anything he seemed pleased, speaking of giving me a ‘promotion’. I don't know, I think it might be time to get a new job. But I'll consider it.
