I was already midway down the road when the first group approached. Three of them, barely tall enough to reach my chest, with merrily illuminated jack-o'-lantern buckets swaying in their tiny hands. Masks, cloaks, and delightful giggles were the typical trademarks of Halloween in our suburban community.  
  
"Trick or treat!" they squealed in unison.  
  
Diving into my pocket, I pulled out a handful of candies and dropped them into their eager hands. The kids' eyes widened with glee, their parents nodding in gratitude from the sidewalk.  
  
As the next batch of children came by, I settled into the routine – smile, offer candies, and watch them move on. Yet, an eerie sensation pricked at the edges of my awareness. The streets looked normal – families, decorations, the smell of pumpkin spice and the gentle hum of laughter.  
  
Except one house, four doors down, was shrouded in darkness.  
  
Contrary to the neighborhood’s decorative spirit, that house was void of any Halloween festivity. I recalled that a young couple had moved in just a month ago. Their silent, reclusive nature was palpable. The only times I'd seen them was during the rare occasion they mowed their lawn or took out the trash.  
  
My internal musings were interrupted by a small hand tapping my shoulder. I turned to see a lone child, mask on, pointing towards that darkened house.  
  
“Mister, they’re not giving candies,” the voice behind the mask muffled.  
  
I nodded, about to explain that maybe the inhabitants weren’t celebrating. But as I looked into the child's eyes, I noticed a glint that felt unsettling. The kid tilted his head slightly, and the hint of a smile became visible beneath the mask.  
  
"They need to pay," he whispered before abruptly turning on his heel and walking away.  
  
What an odd thing to say.  
  
My unease grew. The groups coming to my door started dwindling, but not for the reasons one would expect. They weren't running out, no. They were simply congregating around that dark, unadorned house. Whispers, muffled giggles, then louder discussions began to fill the street. The other adults and I exchanged puzzled glances.  
  
Suddenly, a loud CRASH! echoed from the direction of the house. One of the windows had been broken. Alarm rose as I saw those tiny trick-or-treaters throwing rocks and hurling insults at the home. It was a barrage of chaotic energy, a mass of children turning hostile.  
  
An older teen, maybe seventeen, took charge, trying to intervene. But the moment he approached the kids, he let out a blood-curdling scream, clutching his face. One of the children had slashed him with what appeared to be a razor-blade concealed in a candy wrapper.  
  
Panicking, I ran towards my house, the air thick with a tension I couldn’t understand. As I fumbled with my keys, trying to unlock the door, I felt a tight grip on my ankle.  
  
Looking down, one of the kids - a girl in a fairy costume - stared up at me, her eyes holding a malice that shouldn’t belong to a child.  
  
"We just wanted treats," she hissed.  
  
My hand finally found the doorknob and I yanked it open, slamming it behind me. Peeking through the peephole, the children had now scattered, disappearing into the night's embrace. The assaulted house was wrecked, windows broken, the door hanging off its hinges. But of the couple who lived there? No sign.  
  
Taking a deep breath, I tried to rationalize what had just transpired. Were they playing an elaborate prank? Or had things genuinely taken a darker turn?  
  
A knock on my door made me jump.  
  
"Mr. Phillips," a voice called out, the tone familiar. It was Officer Daniels, a local cop and friend.  
  
Opening the door, I let him in, narrating the bizarre occurrences. He looked concerned, though not surprised.  
  
"There've been reports all over town. Groups of kids turning aggressive when they don’t get their way. It’s unprecedented. We're trying to manage the situation, but these aren’t regular tantrums.”  
  
Suddenly, his radio crackled to life, a distressed voice breaking through, "All units, we've got multiple reports of adults being assaulted. Proceed with caution."  
  
The air grew colder, our apprehensions amplifying.  
  
"They're not just kids," Daniels whispered, his face a shade paler. "There’s something off."  
  
The night was far from over. It was trick or treat... and the tricks were just beginning.  


Daniels and I barricaded ourselves in my living room. The unsettling sounds of Halloween – which should have been cheerful and light-hearted – turned distorted. Distant screams, the crunching of broken glass, and eerie lullabies echoed outside. It wasn’t the Halloween from a childhood memory, but a horror scene birthed from the darkest of nightmares.  
  
"Look at this," Daniels gestured, pulling out his phone.  
  
I stared at the screen. Social media was abuzz with chilling videos. Children, nationwide, exhibiting the same menacing behavior. Some were clustered in circles, chanting in languages I couldn’t understand. Others showed kids standing still, their heads turned skyward, eyes white and unseeing, as if in a trance.  
  
"That's... impossible. This is a joke, right?"  
  
Daniels shook his head. "It's as real as it gets."  
  
The realization that this phenomenon wasn't isolated to our town was overwhelming. Trying to formulate a plan, we decided to monitor the situation and stay put until dawn.  
  
Just as we were getting somewhat settled, a thud resonated through the house. We exchanged a glance of alarm. It sounded like it came from upstairs.  
  
Daniels motioned for me to stay put as he slowly ascended the staircase, his gun drawn. Every creak of the wooden steps heightened my senses. Moments stretched to what felt like hours, but finally, he called out, "Clear."  
  
I exhaled, realizing I'd been holding my breath.  
  
Then, the television – which neither of us had turned on – flickered to life. Static at first, then the screen displayed a feed from what looked like an old-style camcorder. A basement room, dimly lit, with children sitting in a circle. They appeared to be playing a game, laughing and cheerful.  
  
But then the atmosphere shifted. The laughter grew maniacal, distorted. One by one, the children turned to face the camera. Each wore a twisted grin, and their eyes... those were not the eyes of innocent children. They bore into us, as if they could see us watching them.  
  
Suddenly, one of them stepped closer to the camera, filling the screen. The child’s voice, although young, carried an old, chilling depth, "This isn’t about the candies. It's about the message."  
  
The screen went black.  
  
Daniels and I sat in stunned silence. Before we could process, my landline phone rang – a relic I had kept for nostalgia’s sake.  
  
"They’re coming for you," a child’s voice whispered. The line went dead.  
  
The weight of our situation sank in. We were targets, and escape wasn’t an option.  
  
The front door shook as if something or someone was trying to force its way in. A chorus of childlike giggles filled the air, but these weren't joyful – they were laced with malicious intent.  
  
Daniels aimed his gun at the door, ready to defend. "Whatever happens, stay behind me."  
  
The door burst open, revealing not monstrous beings or supernatural entities, but children. Their faces, once innocent, were contorted with anger and malevolence. They charged, not walking, but gliding towards us.  
  
For every child that Daniels tried to hold back, three more would appear. It was overwhelming. They swarmed, pulling, scratching, biting. In the chaos, I caught glimpses of once-familiar faces from the neighborhood – transformed, lost.  
  
A blinding light suddenly flooded the room. The children recoiled, shielding their eyes. Outside, the sound of sirens wailed, and a booming voice ordered, "Stay down!"  
  
Flares, emanating an intense bright light, had been launched outside, keeping the horde at bay. It seemed that the police, or some other force, had discovered their vulnerability to light.  
  
Reinforcements poured in, their floodlights forcing the children to retreat. One by one, they dispersed, hissing and spitting like feral creatures.  
  
Daniels and I, battered and bruised, were evacuated to a makeshift safe zone established at the town's community center. The place buzzed with activity as officials tried to control the situation and tend to the injured.  
  
As dawn approached, a hush settled. The children, no longer in their possessed state, appeared confused and disoriented. Parents and caregivers rushed to comfort them, tears of relief flowing.  
  
But the relief was short-lived.  
  
A news report played on a projector screen: "Halloween Nightmare: Children Across the Nation Affected." A doctor from the CDC addressed the public, "The cause is still unknown. It's neither a virus nor a disease. We're looking into every possible angle."  
  
But the undertone was clear – they were as baffled as we were.  
  
As the sun's first rays hit, the community, though safe for now, knew that Halloween would never be the same again. The boundary between treats and tricks had blurred, and the real question remained:  
  
What had turned our children into messengers of malevolence? And more importantly, what was the "message" they wanted to deliver?

The days that followed were chaotic. The nation struggled to comprehend the horror of that Halloween night. Tensions were high; trust, especially in the children, was eroded. Schools were shut down and curfews imposed, while authorities scrambled for answers.  
  
The CDC, alongside various international organizations, launched an in-depth investigation. All affected children underwent evaluations. Some pointed to the candies, suspecting some form of contamination. However, upon rigorous testing, the treats were declared safe. The commonality remained elusive.  
  
I became involved in a local support group formed to deal with the trauma. There, I met Linda, a child psychologist who was trying to get answers directly from the kids.  
  
"It's like they were tapped into some collective consciousness," she mentioned during one session. "They speak of 'delivering a message' but can't, or won't, clarify further."  
  
Haunted by the chilling footage on my TV that night, I approached her with the idea of hypnotherapy. Delving into their subconscious might reveal clues.  
  
After receiving consent from several parents, Linda began the sessions. I was present during one, where a boy named Max was placed under hypnosis. His demeanor changed, his voice deepening as he began to speak.  
  
"They forgot us," he murmured, eyes closed.  
  
"Who forgot you, Max?" Linda probed gently.  
  
"The old ones... the first children. Buried under concrete, their voices silenced. But on that night, the veil thinned. They reached out, wanting to be remembered."  
  
The room grew colder. Linda's face turned ashen, realization dawning. "Are you talking about the old settlements? The foundations this town was built upon?"  
  
Max nodded slowly. "They were there before any of us. Before the houses and roads. We built on their lands, forgetting them. They only wanted to be remembered, to share their message. We became their voice."  
  
Emerging from hypnosis, Max looked around, bewildered. He remembered nothing.  
  
Historians were consulted, and it was revealed that our town was indeed built upon old settlements, dating back centuries. Many of those early inhabitants were children who had succumbed to various adversities of that time.  
  
A decision was made. The community united to pay homage to the forgotten souls. A memorial park was created at the heart of the town, honoring the first children, the original settlers.  
  
Ceremonies were held, stories shared, and their existence acknowledged. Slowly, an air of normalcy began to return. Children went back to school, laughter resonated in the streets, and the horrors of that Halloween started fading into memory.  
  
But as the next October 31st approached, an air of palpable tension enveloped the town. Parents were hesitant to let their children out, memories of the previous year still fresh.  
  
On the evening of that dreaded date, a gathering was organized at the memorial park. Bonfires were lit, and stories of the old settlers shared. The children sat, rapt, as elders recounted tales of the past.  
  
And as midnight approached, a hush fell upon the crowd. The atmosphere was thick with anticipation. But instead of horror, a sense of peace prevailed. The bonfires flared brighter, and for a fleeting moment, the soft giggles of children – not malicious, but joyful – echoed in the air.  
  
The night passed without incident. The act of remembering had quelled the restless spirits, offering them a voice, a place in our collective memory.  
  
Halloween was never the same again. It became not just a night of fun and frolic, but also one of remembrance. The boundary between our world and the one beyond had been breached, but the message was clear.  
  
In forgetting the past, we had awakened it. In remembering, we had found peace.  
  
And so, every year, amidst the tricks and the treats, we remembered the first children. Their legacy, once lost, now immortalized in the heart of the town they called home.
