So far, so good. Two full days after my first post and nothing more unusual than what already plagues me has occurred. My awful dreams, which are the same every night, went on unchanged. I take that as a good sign. I will elaborate further on those dreams when the time comes.

The next morning, on August 16^(th), 2014, I woke up with a hangover. Something, I thought my body would have acclimated to by this time. But I remembered the recipe for the remedy. Leftovers accompanied by three aspirin and a beer. The journal lay on the carpet atop a wine-stain in my bedroom from the last fight I had with Jessica. I sat on my couch finishing the cold two-day old pizza staring at the journal through the bedroom door.

I had an uneasy feeling for several reasons. I didn't think I was that drunk last night, but the journal seemed much thicker before. It was now so thin there couldn’t have been more than a few pages inside. And then I thought back to the man. He had eavesdropped on me and discovered that I was a journalist of sorts. But that didn't explain why he would give up his work to someone like me. I was a nobody. If there really was a story to share, I was the wrong person to go to if you wanted the world to know. Even I could admit that.

Another thing, was he just carrying it around every night and day in hopes he'd stumble upon a random reporter? I worried that this was more than a chance meeting. He probably knew who I was before I ever saw him.

Great, I thought, a stalker. Just what I need.

Last night’s impulse to take the journal had disappeared by morning, but now that I presumed I was being followed, my curiosity peaked again (with much less intensity). I picked it off the floor and immediately noticed that the texture was greasy. Disgusting. I wiped my hands and the journal with a used towel. It worked for a few seconds, but then the greasy substance would come back. My coffee table was starting to puddle with the stuff.

I couldn't figure out what it was, but it was like the leather cover itself was secreting the clear grease.

At this point, I had enough. I didn't even open it. Just a prank. I had enemies in my field. It wasn’t unknown that I was desperate for a good story. With a pair of tongs, I grabbed it and thrust it into a half-full bag of trash.

I didn't know what kind of chemicals the man has used, but I wasn't going to mess with it. I wouldn’t be made more of a fool than I already had been.

I wasn't too disappointed. My expectations were already as low as you could get. I showered, scrubbing my hands with furious attention, dressed in the least offensive of my soiled wardrobe, gassed myself with spray-on deodorant and headed to work, only stopping to throw away the trash and journal in the communal dumpster.

The drive to work all I could think about was the journal. The grease was gone, but a ghostly residue remained on my palms, not allowing me to forget. The more I thought about it, the more anxious I got. I even volunteered to take the worst of the scheduled interviews offered at our daily meeting. Anything to move about. The office felt too claustrophobic.

Even the wackadoos: a celebrity stalker, a religious fanatic, and a doomsday prepper, couldn't get my mind off the journal. I recorded their statements, not even feigning interest, and got out of there. I was done much quicker than usual because I was not myself. Usually in these interviews it went poorly. I interrupted, scoffed, insulted, anything to get out a story. Funny, if I had done my job as I was supposed to, I would have had a much easier time of it. But I had not the self-awareness to realize that at the time. I wasn't trying to self-improve.

Fortunately, I was hungry again. Biting down on a cheeseburger from my favorite joint brought some reprieve. For the first time that I could remember, I had plenty of free time before I was due back at the office. If I wanted to, I could follow up on a lead given to me by an insider I had within the police force.

He was kind of a moron. Mostly, his leads were weeks old and already solved. I can only say I kept on good terms with him because every other cop hated me. I’m well known in certain circles. I guess having an insider, no matter how useless, made me feel legit. I think I made him feel important as well.

We paired nicely together.

The address given to me led me downtown to an apartment complex that was much nicer than mine. Not that it was in a rich neighborhood or anything, but the constant stream of police sirens, the song of the city, sounded much further away. Like how you counted seconds between thunder to see if a storm was getting closer.

A man by the name of Archie had gone missing a week ago. Several witnesses saw him enter the building, but only one witness had seen him leave. These details aren't very important, but as respect to the disappeared, I'll say the little I knew about the guy. He worked as a waiter at a popular seafood chain. Spent most of his free time at acting classes, failed auditions and the gym. He was blonde and fit. Stood at 6 ft tall. I would never learn more about the man in question that involved anything to do with his life before these events. I'm sorry to say I can only offer him this poor obituary in exchange for the path he set me on. A fair trade.

On the third floor the witness answered her door. A haggard, exhausted single mother holding a baby. Her other children screaming and running around from inside. I showed her my credentials which falsely gave her the impression I worked for a respected news outlet. She said she already gave us everything she knew. I coerced and subtly guilted her into letting me by reminding her a man’s life was in stake and we had to make sure there wasn’t something we missed. She could still be of help. She said I sounded more like a detective than a reporter.

I smiled. "I'm just one of the good ones."

She repeated what she told the others as she boiled spaghetti noodles. For me it was the first time. At around three in the morning she was soothing her infant son when she just happened to look out the window. Even late into the night you'd see some people walking around, doing whatever. That wasn't abnormal. But the man was very big and standing under the streetlight carrying something. It took her a while to realize what she was seeing.

"A body in a sack," she said. "But he didn't fit entirely. He was stuffed face-first, so I couldn't see who it was. But I could clearly make out their legs sticking out of the sack." She slapped a noodle against a cabinet to see if it would stick. It fell slack onto the counter.

It wouldn't be until days later when investigators came by that she learned the man in the sack was most likely Archie.

She continued. "He was in no hurry either. He just stood there for a long time. And then-". She paused with a shiver. "And then he turned around and looked at me."

She seemed to be stuck in that moment until the pot on the stove boiled over. She didn't bother to check if the noodles were ready and got out the strainer.

"What happened next?" I asked.

"I'm not sure, exactly," she said. "The streetlight went out. I became panicked. I thought he'd come up here and kill me because of what I saw."

"Did he?"

"Did he what?"

"Did he come up to? You know, did attempt to break in?"

"No," she said. "The light came back on and he was gone. I called 911. That's all I know." When she looked at me next, I felt sympathy for the first time in a long time. It was a day of firsts. "You wouldn't happen to know if they have any idea who that man is, do you? If he's close to being caught. I don't sleep well anymore. Sometimes, I think I see him in the corner of my room or standing over Sampson's crib. I know it sounds crazy, but I think he's watching me, somehow, even when there’s no way he could be."

"It doesn't sound crazy at all,” I said. I thought about telling her I also had a strange encounter recently, but stopped myself.

She wiped away tears gathering at her eyes. "Thank you."

I stumbled on my words. "For what?"

She shrugged. "The other investigators didn't really react at all to my answers. They just scribbled things down and then they were done with me. Gone, just like that" She snapped her fingers. "Just like that man." 

"Maybe, I'm just bad at my job."

She chuckled.

"I'm sorry, just one more question, if you would.”

She nodded.

“What did this man look like?"

She described the man as I had asked and as she did, my heart started sinking. It was becoming all too familiar. She finished with, "And he was wearing the weirdest thing. I mean, I guess overalls aren't that strange, but that cloak he was wearing. Like, something out of a movie, I guess. I don’t know. It was just weird. That's weird right?"

“Yeah, that’s weird,” I said, almost choking on my words.

She seemed to really warm up to me. She insisted on giving me her number. Made me promise that if I heard anything about the abductor at all, that I would call her. I said I would. But I was really out of it. I didn't even remember saying good bye, or leaving her apartment. I was just suddenly outside.

And as my shock abated I began berating myself. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I had the journal of a key suspect in an abduction case, who also might be tied to several other missing person cases, in my hands and I just threw it away!

It could've been alright. A little dumpster diving. No big deal. Except for one small, important detail. It was garbage day!

I called the office, said I wouldn't be back, feeling suddenly ill. Diarrhea. Real nasty stuff. I'd type up the stories and email them tonight. My boss sounded pissed. But I hardly gave two shits about that. I had to get home. Maybe by some miracle, the garbage truck hadn’t arrived yet. That happened sometimes, right? Bad traffic, a flat, maybe an accident.

Alas, it wouldn't have mattered anyways, even if I had been gifted extra time. It was rush hour. Ten miles of road grinding at the clock. By the time I made it back home there was a single fresh bag of trash in the belly of the dumpster and that was it.

But I would not be rebuked so easily. Fate was not going to have it's way with me. Not this time. I went to my apartment for some gloves and a shovel...I didn't think I had a shovel. But I would damn well find to dig around the dump with.

Finally, I had a reason to do something. Not only could I solve this case, but I could even help someone in the process who actually deserved it.

That roaring to go feeling deflated the instant I dragged my ass back to my apartment. There on the coffee table was the journal with a folded note tucked into the elastic strap that held the journal closed.

I unfolded the note with shaky hands. It read: Mulligan.
