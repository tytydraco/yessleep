  
My name is Dr. Jonathan Westwood, and I am a passionate paleontologist and curator of the Museum of the Rockies. I have spent my life unearthing the secrets of the ancient Earth. As a paleontologist, I have dedicated my life to unearthing the remnants of prehistoric creatures. But as I reside in the lodge here in the State of the Amazonas, Brazil, I am documenting the events that unfolded on this excursion of ours. I am typing on my laptop with each detail of what has transpired, trying to keep a hold of myself with my trembling. But I have to write this down. And I must, and I will.  Let me begin with the genesis of the expedition that I have made.  
  
  
   
It all started when I was given information via email about a newly discovered geological formation in Brazil, deep in the state of the Amazonas from an old colleague and Brazilian counterpart whom I had known before. with a PDF that contains a map and survey of this formation. I have gathered a team that is composed of graduates and veteran paleontologists that I have closely worked with.   
  
  
  
  
The thrill of discovery has always fueled my passion, driving me to explore the mysteries hidden deep within the Earth's ancient layers. Little did I know that my most significant find awaited me in the heart of the Amazon rainforest.  
  
  
  
  
   
The day started like any other. My team and I set out on our expedition, hacking through dense foliage and battling the oppressive humidity. Our goal was to uncover evidence of ancient life and piece together the puzzle of our planet's history.  
  
Days turned into weeks, and just as my optimism began to wane, I stumbled upon a buried treasure—a massive skull protruding from the earth. Excitement surged through my veins as I delicately brushed away the dirt, revealing the dark secrets concealed within the fossil.  
   
  
  
  
Me and my team uncovered the fossilized remains of a colossal dinosaur skull. The sheer size and unique characteristics sent a shiver down my spine. It was a creature unlike anything that I had encountered before.  
   
  
  
  
The skull possessed an uncanny aura, an ominous presence unlike anything I had discovered on my previous excursions. Its sharp, menacing teeth seemed to sneer at me, as if mocking my audacity to disturb its eternal slumber.   
  
  
  
  
The hollow eye sockets stared into my soul with an unnerving gaze that filled me with a sense of foreboding. The more we dug in, the more the fossil revealed itself. Only leaving partial vertebrae, ribs, remnants of a tail, femur, and feet.  
   
  
  
It was to be expected that the remains of this extinct specimen would be discovered. As I observed this, one of my colleagues unearthed another specimen. This time, it was a horned dinosaur. But! To my utter shock, it wasn't a ceratopsian. In fact, it was an entirely new species of dinosaur that we discovered. Joy, shock, and excitement filled the air as the fossilized skeleton was almost complete.   
  
  
  
  
With a single horn on its head, no frills, but body proportions that were similar to those of a Titanothere, but a dinosaur equivalent to one. With its short tail and barrel-like body, whose bones were thick, my eyes examined this prehistoric beast. As I hypothesized that it was a heavyset animal that browsed the Cretaceous forest.  
  
  
  
   
And so we all came together to come up with a name for this horned beast. And we all agreed to call it Oreinotherosaurus superioritus. But as for this theropod, we don't have a name yet for it.  
   
  
  
   
Compelled by curiosity and scientific fervor, I pushed forward, meticulously unearthing the fossilized remains of this enigmatic creature. Piece by piece, the creature took shape—Diablo, a name that seemed to echo the very essence of evil given by one of the Brazilian men who accompanied us. The fossils were red—blood red, in fact. But I just shrugged it off as nothing but iron covering the fossils over the past 66 million years.   
   
  
  
However! I kind of like that name. Diablotrovão, the Thunder Devil, it shall be called. The more I looked at this red fossil, the better it matched.  
  
  
  
  
As the skeleton emerged, I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of unease. Diablo's form came alive in my mind, a horrific vision of a ruthless predator. I found myself haunted by vivid imaginings of its existence, its powerful limbs tearing through the primeval landscape, leaving a trail of fear in its wake. Was it a dream I had? If so, it felt so real.  
   
  
  
  
   
The closer I came to unlocking Diablo's secrets, the more the shadows closed in around me. Locals warned me of an ancient curse, cautioning against disturbing the spirits of the rainforest. Yet my scientific ambition overshadowed their superstitions, propelling me deeper into a dark labyrinth of discovery.  
   
  
  
  
But the rainforest had a voice of its own—a voice carried by the wind. Whispers danced in the air, bearing fragments of an ancient warning. Doubt gnawed at my mind as I questioned the consequences of my relentless pursuit.  
   
  
  
   
Late night at the excavation site became a macabre dance with destiny. Alone in the tent, my fingers traced the contours of Diablo's unearthed skull, its presence overwhelming. The flickering light cast haunting shadows, conspiring to shape my growing unease into tangible fear.  
  
  
   
Within the depths of that tent, the line between fascination and terror blurred. Diablo's remains seemed to possess a malevolent sentience, an awareness of my presence. Each passing night, I felt its spectral gaze upon me, penetrating my dreams and fueling my growing sense of dread.  
  
  
   
  
The fateful day arrived when I heard screams coming from outside of my tent. The earth trembled beneath me, its convulsions mirroring the turmoil within my soul. The air turned icy cold, carrying the stench of ancient malevolence. I stumbled out of the tent, and witnessed the horror I had awakened. Until something unexpected has happened. Something I wished shouldn't have occurred.   
   
  
  
   
There it was, the real Diablo, gazing around with its massive head side by side, with one of the native Brazilians in its blood soaked jaws. It stood over the assemblage of fossilized bones that we unearthed, as this creature of horror walked past our tents. This large, carnivorous dinosaur belongs to the family Abelisauridae. These Abelisaurids were a group of brutished, predatory theropods that flourished on the southern continent of South America, during the Late Cretaceous period.  
   
  
  
  
Diablo had the appearance of a formidable predator, characterized by robust limbs, strong jaws adorned with sharp, serrated teeth, and perhaps even distinctive horns and crests on its head. Its robust and burly size and physical attributes could evoke a sense of dread and awe. Its broad shoulders and short, stubby arms make it truly distinct. Its entire body is crimson with a hue of reddish brown covered in tough osteoderms and scutes.  
   
  
  
  
Now standing at an imposing height of around 25 feet at the hip, he towers over most humans. Its overall length, including its long tail, might extend to approximately 53 feet.   
   
   
  
  
As for weight, I can only estimate Diablo to be around 6–8 tons or more, possibly 10. This weight range would reflect its robust skeletal structure, powerful musculature, and rough hide of its predatory nature.  
   
  
  
  
   
The sight before me was beyond comprehension. Diablo stood before me in all its diabolical glory. The flesh on its head and mouth, blackened by the blood it shed, pulsating with an unholy energy and a bellowing growl. Its eyes, void of warmth or mercy, burned with an infernal fire that penetrated the depths of my soul.  
   
  
  
  
A primal fear gripped me as Diablo's thunderous roar shattered the silence of the rainforest. The ground cracked beneath its immense weight, a testament to the power it possessed. Every step reverberated with malevolence, closing the distance between us with horrifying speed.  
   
  
   
  
I cautiously traversed the thick undergrowth, walking with each step. The air was heavy with the stench of decay and humidity. Suddenly, a chilling hiss cut through the silence, freezing me in my tracks. I slowly turned my head, as my own eyes were widening as I found myself face to face with a pair of gleaming, yellow eyes. A massive caiman, easily over 45 feet in length, lurked at the water's edge, its enormous jaws agape, revealing rows of bone crushing razor-sharp teeth in its heavy jaws. It had a broad snout with distinctive bands.  
   
  
  
  
Fear gripped me as I realized I had unwittingly ventured too close to the creature's territory. The caiman's eyes locked onto mines, its gaze filled with predatory intensity. I slowly backed away, my every movement measured and deliberate. The giant caiman followed my retreat, its thick, scaly, dark body partially submerged in the murky water, ready to strike at any moment. It was a narrow escape, a chilling reminder of the dangers that lurked in the Amazon's watery depths.  
   
   
  
  
   
The encounter with the caiman left me on edge as my nerves frayed. I sought refuge on higher ground, hoping to find safety amidst the dense foliage. As I cautiously made my way through the tangled vines, my eyes widened at the sight before me. Almost coiling among the trees, a serpent of immense proportions lay in wait.  
  
  
   
  
The serpent's scales glistened with iridescent hues, mesmerizing yet foreboding. Its forked tongue flickered in and out, tasting the air as if assessing my presence. I felt a mixture of awe and trepidation as I saw the creature as some sort of giant, elongated serpent, the embodiment of primal power. But this was a new species. Of having a lizard-like head and stripes on its body.  
  
  
   
  
My mind raced, searching for a way to avoid provoking the massive serpent. I knew the slightest misstep could spell disaster. With utmost care, I again slowly retraced my steps, my eyes locked on the serpent's unblinking gaze. The tense silence was broken only by the rustle of leaves. It was a harrowing test of nerve, a battle of wills with one of the Amazon's most fearsome inhabitants.  
  
  
   
   
  
Finally, I found myself out of the serpent's range, the oppressive weight of its presence lifting from my shoulders. I breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that I had narrowly escaped the serpent's deadly embrace. The encounter left me humbled and reminded me of the untamed nature of the rainforest, where every step held the potential for a confrontation with its formidable inhabitants.  
   
  
  
These encounters with the giant caiman and the giant serpent would serve as pivotal moments in my journey, heightening the sense of danger and unpredictability that surrounded them in the Amazon. The confrontation with these formidable creatures would test his resilience and serve as haunting reminders of the perils inherent in my quest for discovery. Until I heard Diablo's roar.  
   
  
  
My heart pounded in my chest, and the sound of my own mortality echoed in my ears. Panic welled up inside me, threatening to consume my rationality. I ran, fueled by sheer survival instinct, my every breath a desperate plea for escape from this nightmare of my own making.  
   
  
  
But Diablo pursued me again relentlessly, its monstrous form tearing through the rainforest, relentless in its pursuit. I stumbled over roots and dense undergrowth, my mind clouded by fear. Every glance over my shoulder revealed the twisted visage of Diablo, a grim reminder of the horrors that awaited me if it caught up.  
  
  
   
As Diablo ventured deeper into the heart of the rainforest, it encountered a formidable presence—a giant caiman from before that lay in wait along the banks of a murky river. The air crackled with tension as the ancient reptilian adversaries faced each other, locked in a primal struggle for dominance.  
   
  
  
The giant caiman's jaws snapped with a thunderous force, a warning to Diablo that it was not to be trifled with. But Diablo, fueled by an ancient power and an instinct honed over millennia, met the caiman's challenge head-on. With lightning reflexes, it lunged at the massive reptile, its jaws snapping at the amphibious beast.  
  
   
  
  
A ferocious battle ensued, with the clash of titans reverberating through the rainforest. The caiman's massive tail thrashed against the ground, creating tremors that rippled through the water. Diablo, agile and relentless, circled its adversary, striking with calculated precision. Its jaws clamped onto the caiman's thick hide, while its powerful hind legs delivered bone-crushing kicks.  
  
  
   
As the battle raged on, I watched from a safe distance. The primal forces at play were awe-inspiring, yet I knew that the outcome of this clash could have dire consequences for the delicate balance of the rainforest.  
   
  
  
Amidst the chaos, a new threat emerged—a giant serpent, from before, drawn by the commotion. With eyes gleaming with an otherworldly light, it slithered towards the battle scene, its massive coils ready to strike. The clash of the titans took an unexpected turn as Diablo, momentarily distracted by the serpent's arrival, found itself caught between two formidable foes.  
   
  
  
My mind raced as I witnessed the unfolding chaos. Two ancient creatures, locked in a primal struggle, threatened to tear the rainforest apart. The clash of fangs and claws sent shockwaves through the air, while the earth trembled beneath their immense power.  
   
  
  
In a display of instinctive survival, Diablo unleashed a flurry of attacks, striking at both the caiman and the serpent. Its powerful jaws tore through scales and flesh, inflicting wounds that dripped with primal fury. But the caiman and the serpent were not easily defeated. They fought back with equal determination, their primal instincts driving them to protect their territory and assert their dominance.  
   
  
  
As the battle reached its crescendo, a moment of truth hung in the air. Torn between fascination and the need to preserve the delicate balance of the rainforest, in the midst of the chaotic clash between Diablo, the giant caiman, and the giant serpent, I had a mix of anticipation and concern as only one could be on top. I knew that the outcome of this battle would have far-reaching consequences for the fragile equilibrium of the rainforest.  
  
  
   
As the titanic struggle continued, a realization dawned on me. I only understood that I couldn't stand idly by, merely observing the clash of these mighty creatures. And so, I had to escape. And let these monsters deal with each other.  
   
  
  
I cautiously made my way through the dense foliage, further escaping into an unknown location. And then, in a moment that felt both surreal and awe-inspiring, I found myself standing before a gathering of dinosaurs that once roamed this very land. The towering presence of the Titanosaurs commanded attention, their colossal forms casting a shadow over the landscape. Their elongated necks stretched upwards, their heads adorned with blunt snouts and tiny eyes that seemed to peer into the depths of time.  
  
  
   
Amidst the Titanosaurs, graceful Hadrosaurs moved in herds, their chunky bodies and duck-billed mouths a testament to their herbivorous nature. I began to marvel at their ability to navigate the dense vegetation; their specialized teeth were perfectly adapted for grazing on ferns and other foliage. and There I saw large species of Meiolanids and Chelonoidis that were as big as bison, if not bigger.  
  
  
   
Amongst the herbivores, armored Ankylosaurs trudged along, their bodies covered in thick, bony plates and adorned with menacing spikes. I was fascinated by their sturdy defenses, a formidable barrier against any would-be predator. And there was that horned herbivorous dinosaur that I and my team discovered, browsing on the water's edge.   
  
  
   
As I immersed myself in this prehistoric tableau, I couldn't help but feel a profound sense of wonder. The rainforest echoed with the echoes of these ancient beings, as if whispering their stories through time. The sight of these majestic creatures inspired a mixture of awe, curiosity, and deep respect for the rich tapestry of life that once thrived in this very place.  
   
  
  
With each step, my scientific mind was filled with questions. How did these creatures interact? What was their social structure like? How did they navigate the challenges of survival in this lush, unforgiving environment? And why are these dinosaurs still existing?  
  
  
  
This has defied all fundamental logic. Until I remembered a few years ago a theory that non-avian dinosaurs survived well into the Paleocene. If that is the case. Then these must be the descendents of these so-called Paleocene dinosaurs. But these beasts weren't alone. A group Ground Sloths feasted on the ground, glyptodonts and Gomphotheres and notoungulates all before my eyes. As if time truly was frozen. But as much as I want to stay here, I have to escape and return to civilization.  
   
  
   
In the depths of my desperation, I stumbled upon an ancient temple hidden within the rainforest's embrace. Crumbling stone walls stood as the last bastion of hope against Diablo's wrath. With trembling hands, I pushed open the creaking doors, hoping to find sanctuary within its ancient halls.  
   
  
  
  
As I entered the temple, a sense of eerie tranquility settled upon me. The air felt heavy with forgotten power, as if the very walls held the secrets of the ages. I clutched onto a small vial, an artifact believed to possess protective properties against the forces I had unwittingly unleashed.  
   
  
  
   
A surge of determination washed over me as I placed the vial on a pedestal, its surface adorned with cryptic carvings. My voice trembled as I recited a prayer, a desperate plea for deliverance from the horrors that now pursued me. There, the beast couldn't come in due to its immeasurable size. There, above me, was a statue of a feathered serpent, or dragon. And below it were these three large terracotta jars.   
  
  
  
I ran to them and saw they were filled with black liquid. I smelled it, and I immediately recognized it as oil. I didn't care how they came to know of oil, but the beast was ramming its head on the wall, hammering with all of its strength. I tore my shirt, dunked it in a black substance, and yanked out a lighter from my pocket. Diablo bursts in, seeing rows of teeth in his open maw. It slammed itself into the three terracotta jars. Its front portion was completely covered in the black substance.  
   
   
  
I lit up the rag and threw it at the theropod.  
In that moment, the unholy presence of Diablo began to wane. Its flesh receded under the consuming flame, revealing its burned flesh. The beast ran out, screaming in agony. But the temple crumbled upon the beast, and it was no more. I escaped in time before Diablo had a chance to take me.  
  
  
  
  
Standing amidst the aftermath of my own folly, I realized the true cost of my relentless pursuit of knowledge. The discovery of Diablo, the diabolical theropod, forever scarred my soul. Its tale served as a constant reminder of the dangers that await those who tread too far into the realms of the unknown.   
  
  
  
It became my mission to ensure that future generations of paleontologists would learn from my mistakes, treading the fine line between curiosity and the preservation of the world's delicate equilibrium.  
  
  
   
As for Diablo, it died within that temple, its secrets once again sealed away. The rainforest reclaimed its dominion, leaving only whispers of the ancient horror that had briefly haunted the world.
