The letter arrived on a hot Monday, wedged between overdue bills and discount flyers I’d never use. I nearly threw it out with the rest, but the thick envelope caught my eye, the deep blue ink of my name curling across the paper like ivy.

I didn’t have an aunt Evelyn. At least, not one I’d ever heard of.

Her words were warm, almost *too* warm for someone I’d never met. She had followed my progress from afar, she said. She knew how hard I was working, how difficult it must be to balance school and living expenses alone. But she had an opportunity for me—one that would ease my burdens. A job offer for the summer, room and board included, working for her at *her*  homeopathic pharmacy in a small countryside town.

It should have sounded *insane.* A distant relative appearing out of nowhere, offering me exactly what I needed at the exact moment I needed it? It felt like it was the kind of thing that belonged in cautionary tales, the sort of too-good-to-be-true luck that ended in regret.

And yet… I was exhausted. Rent was rising. My savings were vanishing. I had been eating instant noodles for weeks.

I held the letter to my chest and stared at the walls of my tiny flat, listening to the hum of my neighbor’s TV through the thin plaster. The city had been grinding me down for months. Maybe the countryside would be a break, a breath of fresh air before the weight of the new semester, in a couple of months,  crushed me completely.

So, I accepted. 

The train ride was long, the kind that lulls you into a false sense of peace. At first, the city stretched on, gray and endless, but slowly, the world outside my window softened. Concrete gave way to fields, then forests, deep and untamed.

I had always felt uneasy in places like this. There was something about the countryside—its vastness, its quiet—that made me feel *small*. Isolated. In the city, noise was constant, people were always *there*, even if they were strangers. 

The closer we got to my stop though, the more I felt a slow, creeping euphoria, curling its way up my spine.

By the time the train pulled into the station, I was almost lightheaded.

And waiting for me on the platform, with a small, knowing smile, was aunt Evelyn.

I knew it was her before we made introductions—or more accurately, she knew *me*, staring with an unreadable expression I couldn’t decipher. Aunt Evelyn’s smile never wavered as she led me away from the train station. Her raven-black hair framed a face that seemed to hold both kindness and something I couldn’t quite place—an intensity that was unsettling yet magnetic. Her clothing was simple, but the colors were striking—earthy tones that blended seamlessly with the natural world around us.

“Welcome,” she said, her voice a rich, comforting melody. “I hope the journey wasn’t too taxing. I know the train can be long, but there’s nothing quite like arriving to fresh air.”

I nodded, still trying to make sense of everything. “I… didn’t expect it to be so… quiet here,” I admitted, my words almost swallowed by the stillness of the countryside.

Aunt Evelyn chuckled. “The world has a way of calming down in places like this. Here, everything slows. You'll see—there’s a certain rhythm to it.”

I wanted to ask her more, wanted to press her on how exactly were we related, or how did she know so much about me, but her gentle demeanor made me hesitant. It was as if any discomfort I felt could be brushed away with a simple word from her.

The walk to her house was short, but the journey seemed to stretch on. The path was flanked by rows of tall hedges, their edges so neatly trimmed they looked almost unnatural, as though they had been sculpted by someone with far too much time on their hands – there was no one in sight, though.

Her house was exactly as I’d imagined—a charming, picturesque two-story house that seemed to belong in an old fairy tale: white-washed walls, ivy creeping up the sides, a thatched roof that seemed impossibly perfect. Even the windows, framed with wooden shutters, were so quaint it almost looked like they belonged in another time.

Inside, it was no less enchanting. The floors were hardwood, warm and gleaming, stretching out into rooms filled with the scent of dried herbs and a subtle, floral fragrance that clung to the air. Shelves lined the walls, stocked with jars and bottles of every shape and size, filled with odd powders and liquids that shimmered with colors that seemed to change as you looked at them. The walls were adorned with tapestries of intricate designs, some depicting scenes of nature, others more abstract, like strange, twisting vines that seemed to move if you stared too long.

The pharmacy was attached to the house, yet it felt somewhat separate. The main area where customers came and went was distinct from the living quarters, creating a divide between business and home. Though connected, the two spaces had their own purpose, as if the house and the pharmacy coexisted rather than blended together.

The wooden counter stretched long and smooth, the shelves behind it meticulously arranged with bottles and vials. Some bore familiar labels—chamomile, lavender, eucalyptus—while others were written in a script I didn’t recognize. The air held a mixture of scents—earthy, floral, sometimes even metallic—and I could tell that this was the true heart of aunt Evelyn’s work.

“This is incredible,” I murmured, my voice barely above a whisper, as though I feared disturbing the serenity of the space.

Aunt Evelyn gave me another of those knowing smiles. “I’m glad you like it,” she said softly. “I really hope you feel at home here. It’s a place where the world outside can’t touch you.”

We continued wandering through the house until we reached the back door, which opened into a garden so lush it seemed to pulse with life. I had seen gardens before, but nothing like this. The flowers were so vivid they seemed almost unnatural—brilliant violets and deep crimson roses, their petals glistening as if coated with dew, even though the air felt dry. The herbs were equally mesmerizing: rows of mint and thyme, but also odd plants I didn’t recognize, their leaves shimmering with iridescent hues that changed as the light shifted.

“Is this all… real?” I asked, stepping closer to a cluster of flowers that seemed to glow faintly in the dimming light.

“Real enough” aunt Evelyn replied with a small, cryptic smile. “These are the plants I work with, the ones that help others. They’re a part of this land, and they have a way of… growing with the people who tend them.”

I couldn’t stop staring at the garden, a sense of awe filling me, but there was something about it that felt *too* perfect. It was impossible to say, but it felt as though the land itself had been cultivated with some purpose far beyond simple gardening. 

I wasn’t sure if it was the garden’s magic, or the strange pull aunt Evelyn seemed to have on me, but in that moment, everything else felt far away. The questions I had, the doubts swirling in my mind, seemed to fade into the background, replaced by a dizzying, inexplicable sense of calm.

But deep down, a small voice in my mind whispered, *This isn’t normal. None of this is normal.*

Over the next few days, I settled into a strange routine. Aunt Evelyn guided me through the preparation of various tinctures, salves, and potions. She was patient, teaching me to mix ingredients in a way that felt almost intuitive, as though I were following an ancient rhythm rather than learning a craft. The house, with its endless shelves of jars and bottles, became my new world. But the deeper I delved into the work, the more questions piled up—questions I couldn’t seem to ask without meeting her cryptic, serene smile.

“Is there any… particular reason why these?” I asked one morning, holding up a jar of something green and sticky.

“Every herb has its purpose,” Aunt Evelyn replied, her voice gentle, her hands moving deftly as she worked on another concoction. “But not all purposes are obvious.”

I was used to studying, used to dissecting everything with a logical, academic approach. But here, logic seemed to bend and twist in ways that made my skin itch. There was something… *strange* about it all. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it.

And then there were the clients. Every morning without fail, they arrived, one by one, like clockwork. The first time I saw them, I thought I was imagining things. But each day after, they grew harder to ignore.

The first was a woman, tall and unnervingly perfect, with silken golden hair that shimmered in the sunlight, her eyes the color of deep emeralds. But it was her fingers—long, delicate, and translucent—that made me pause. They were almost like glass, catching the light in strange, unsettling ways. She didn’t speak a word as she handed Aunt Evelyn a small, intricately carved wooden box. The air around her shimmered, like heat rising off pavement, and I couldn’t look away, even as she glanced at me with a cold, impersonal gaze.

Next came a man—a stranger whose features were so symmetrical, so unreal, they made my stomach turn. His skin was almost too smooth, too flawless, and his eyes were deep pools of silver, staring right through me. He didn’t smile. He didn’t greet me, either, but instead handed over a bundle of fresh leaves wrapped in brown paper. He didn’t ask for anything. Just left.

As the days passed, more appeared. A woman with skin like bark, her eyes hollow like the depths of a forest; a young man whose legs seemed to bend at impossible angles as he moved, the sharp sound of snapping joints echoing in the still air. And the one I feared most: a figure cloaked in shadow, whose face I never saw but whose presence seemed to twist the very air around us.

My questions about our strange clientele were never answered. I asked aunt Evelyn countless times about the purpose of the concoctions we made, about why certain clients received particular mixtures, but she only ever told me who they were for—never what they were for. It was as if the *what* didn’t matter, only the *who*. She would smile, as always, and say, “You’ll understand when the time comes,” but that time never seemed to arrive. Instead, I was left to continue the work, the meaning behind it all just out of reach, like a shadow at the edge of my vision.

But no one ever spoke to me directly—except for the handsome young man who came on the fourth day. He was striking in every way, with dark, tousled hair and eyes that seemed to flicker between amber and gold. His smile was disarming, too charming, as though he knew how to bend you to his will with just a glance.

He approached the counter with a confidence that made my heart race.

“Good morning,” he said, his voice smooth and low, like a melody. “I was wondering if you might be able to help me. I’ve heard you’ve taken over for your aunt. Such a lovely lady. But surely you know how to make things… *interesting* around here.”

He lingered near the counter, his gaze never leaving mine. “I don’t suppose you’d invite me in for a cup of tea? Perhaps we could… talk.”

I swallowed, my mind racing with the rules aunt Evelyn had drilled into me. *No giving away your real name. No inviting anyone inside. No accepting gifts. No bargains. No pleasantries.* Initially, they had seemed odd, even obnoxious. But now, standing behind the shop counter, staring at the figure before me, they suddenly felt essential.

I forced a smile and stepped back, keeping the counter between us. “I’m afraid I can’t offer you tea. But if you need something, I can help you find it.”

The young man raised an eyebrow, his smile curling into something almost predatory. “No tea, no invitation?” He chuckled softly, but there was something off about the sound, like it was too rehearsed. “A shame. You have such a lovely place. Maybe I’ll find a way to make you change your mind.”

I could feel the weight of his gaze on me as I turned to fetch a bottle. My hands were clammy, my pulse racing. What was it about him? He didn’t look *dangerous*, not in the way I’d been warned to expect. But there was something deeply unsettling in the way he watched me—like he could see straight through me.

The days blurred into one another. The strange clients came and went, always as eerie and enigmatic. Each morning, as the sun crept lazily over the horizon, they would appear, one after another, like clockwork. The woman with the glassy fingers, the man whose movements creaked like dry wood, the figure cloaked in shadow—always they came for their medicines, always they said nothing, merely leaving behind their odd, wordless exchanges.

I was learning the craft quickly, though it felt like the deeper I went, the more I became a part of the strange world around me. Each concoction I made, every herb I measured out, felt more like a ritual than a recipe. Aunt Evelyn had taught me the steps without explaining their significance—*why* certain plants went with others, *why* they were mixed in such precise ways—but I didn’t question it. There was something almost hypnotic about the way she guided me through the motions. The quiet of the house, the hum of the garden, it all melded together until the days felt endless.

*When was I meant to leave?*

It was on one of those quiet mornings that I first noticed her absence.

I woke, as usual, to the sound of the birds outside, the soft rustle of leaves in the garden, but when I stepped into the kitchen, the house was empty. The familiar scent of herbs and lavender was absent. There was no clinking of jars, no rustle of Aunt Evelyn’s skirts. The house felt hollow, like a shell without its heartbeat.

I wandered through the rooms, calling her name softly at first, then louder when I didn’t hear an answer. “Aunt Evelyn?” I called, my voice strange in the silence. “Where are you?”

There was no reply. No echo of her footsteps on the stairs, no flicker of her shadow moving across the walls.

Suddenly, the familiar chime of the bell above the door rang out, and for a brief moment, I felt a wave of relief. My head snapped around in response, but the comfort was fleeting. I *felt* him before I even saw him.

The young man, with his dark, tousled hair and that smile that never quite reached his eyes, stepped inside, his gaze fixed on me with a predatory calm. This time, he didn’t approach the counter. Instead, he leaned casually against the doorframe, his eyes gleaming with an almost playful mischief.

“Back again, I see,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady, my thoughts locked tight around the rules aunt Evelyn had left me with.

He tilted his head slightly, a slow smile curling at the corners of his mouth. “You’re learning quickly, I see,” he said, his voice smooth, like honey mixed with something darker. “But you still seem so... *tense*.” His eyes never leaving mine. “Come now, there’s no need to be so formal. I think you know I’m not like the others.”

I stiffened. *He was trying to trick me again.*

I refused to meet his gaze directly, focusing instead on the tinctures behind the counter, hoping to maintain some distance between us. “Is there something I can help you with?” I asked, voice tight.

His smile widened, but there was no warmth in it. I felt my pulse quicken, the air around us thick with his presence. “You know, I could make things easier for you,” he said softly. “It doesn’t have to be so lonely here. You don’t have to follow all these silly little rules. *Invite me in*... Let me show you what I can offer.”

I took a deep breath, remembering the rules. I couldn’t give my name. I couldn’t invite him in. I couldn’t break any of them. I held my ground.

“No,” I said, my voice firmer now, though I could feel the hesitation in my chest. 

He sighed, pushing himself off the doorframe with exaggerated slowness, his eyes flickering with amusement. “Pity. You’d be much happier without them.” He stepped back, giving me one last, lingering look. “But… I guess we’ve got a lot of time, haven’t we?” His voice was low, almost teasing, as if he were savoring the thought of me being trapped here with him.

With a final lingering glance, he turned and left, the door closing softly behind him, leaving me standing there, shaken. The silence that followed was louder than any words he could have spoken.

Panic began to creep into my chest. I rushed to the back door, to the garden, but it was the same. No sign of my aunt. Just the rows of plants swaying in the wind, the stillness of the air thick with something I couldn’t place.

A sense of unease gnawed at me. *Had she gone somewhere?* But I couldn’t remember her telling me anything about leaving. She had never mentioned a trip, never said a word about disappearing. 

Suddenly, I realised I had no way of reaching her. Why are there no phones here? When was the last time I spoke to anyone? And where are all the townspeople, except for my aunt's odd customers?

The silence felt heavy, oppressive.

I tried to steady my breathing, my thoughts racing. “Maybe I missed something,” I muttered to myself, pacing. 

I glanced in the kitchen, trying to find some clue, some sign that she had just stepped out for a moment. That’s when I noticed it—the book. The one she had left by the counter the night before, its cover worn and frayed, its presence unremarkable at first. I hadn’t even thought to open it before, but now it seemed to call to me.

I reached for it, my fingers trembling as I flipped it open. The pages were old, the ink faded but still legible. The book was filled with strange symbols, drawings of herbs I had never seen before, and instructions for concoctions I didn’t understand. But it was the last page that caught my eye—written in bold, sweeping script, it read:

*"The pharmacy is yours now. You are its keeper. You will serve those who come, and you will keep to the rules. Do not stray from them. The garden will provide you with everything you need. The house is a place where the world outside can’t touch you."*

My stomach dropped. The house, the garden, the entire world around me felt suffocating. It wasn’t just her house anymore. It was mine. And there was no way out.

I grabbed my coat and rushed outside, my eyes scanning the distant horizon. But there was nothing. No sign of her anywhere. I stood there for what felt like hours, waiting, hoping—hoping that she would come back, that this was all some strange mistake.

I sank to my knees, the weight of the book pressing into my palms.

*I’m trapped here*, I thought, my breath shallow, my heart racing.

The next morning, as the first light of dawn filtered through the windows, I prepared for another day, my mind tangled in the same thoughts. The pharmacy was mine now, and I was meant to tend to it. I was meant to follow the rules.
