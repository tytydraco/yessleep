The nightmare began with a familiar, modern anxiety: I hadn't secured a PhD position, and for that failure, my parents abandoned me. I was sent away to our old village home in India, to live with my uncle and his three cousins.

The world there was bleak and oppressive. Unhygienic household, old furniture, and lack of essential basics. My days fell into a cycle of servitude, where I was treated as a maid. The abuse was constant—they beat me, sometimes with withering words that stung more than their hands, and sometimes with actual blows. "Have you found a job yet?" they would ask, their questions laced with menace. A chilling realization soon dawned on me that something was deeply and dangerously wrong; they were planning to push me into the well or get me married, I clearly remember. That fear gave me the adrenaline I needed to run.

I fled and found a hiding place in a crumbling, ancient archaeological site. It was a place of forgotten beauty, filled with intricate urns, faded tapestries, mysterious artifacts, gleaming jewelry, and ancient scrolls—a silent testament to a bygone era. There, among the ruins, the rules of reality seemed to bend. Time itself frayed, and I felt myself change, shrinking back into the body of my 8-year-old self.

The world I emerged into was ancient, a place that felt like the Mohenjo-daro or Harappa civilization. Mud houses stood dark against the sky, with no streetlights, only the flickering orange glow of lamps. The people were strange and unsettling, like angry, twisted zombies, their bodies adorned with gold jewelry but barely any clothes. Yet, not all were malevolent; some simply went about their business, and a few even offered hushed warnings as I passed. I was trying to hide and walk discreetly.

In this terrifying world, a woman appeared, clutching a newborn baby and running for her life. "We have to run," she told me, her eyes wide with fear. "We are not like them, and they will kill us." Even as the twisted, angry mob of women surged behind us, chasing relentlessly, she seemed to possess a subtle, almost magical knowledge, employing quick, evasive maneuvers that suggested a deeper understanding of movement, momentarily baffling our pursuers. She handed me her child, her expression desperate. "You have to fly," she urged.

"I can't fly," I protested, my 8-year-old voice small and thin. "I'm only a child."

"When the time comes, you will fly," she promised, before disappearing.

The mob followed the woman and I fell unnoticed on the ground. With the baby in my arms, I ran until I came to a small river. As I scrambled along its edge, a flash flood roared through, and the water began to rise around me. I thought I would drown, but just as the water closed over my head, a strange buoyancy lifted me. I was flying, but not gracefully like a bird. It was clumsy and frantic, like the desperate flapping of a goose or a duck, just barely keeping me above the churning surface. I think my body still remembers the gravity, the force of water as a big waterfall approached, I almost cracked a smile. The water was murky, with an aquamarine hue and a grey foam on the surface.

Flying badly, I crossed the vast river, where water stretched to the horizon. Guided by some deep intuition, I eventually reached what felt like the archipelago of Stockholm. There, in a moment of calm, I looked down at the baby in the basket. Its face was my own.

Suddenly, a dizzying paradox clicked into place. The grown woman who gave me the child was me. The terrified 8-year-old running for her life was me. And the helpless infant in the basket was me, too. All three the protector, the child, and the innocent were all the same person.

The moment I grasped this impossible truth, the dream shattered. The basket, the 8-year-old me, and the vast river all vanished. I was myself again, a 26-year-old, collapsed on a riverbank and desperately trying to breathe. Then, with a final jolt, I woke up, coughing and spitting out water as if I had truly almost drowned.

P.s - I do live in Uppsala and recently finished my graduation here, I have 6 months job search visa left here. My parents were pretty unavailable growing up and I grew up in a cruel socio-economic group.
