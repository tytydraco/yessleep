My last words being a Reddit post is actually pretty sad, but I don’t have anyone else to turn to. Anyone else would think I’m crazy or they’ve died. I guess I should explain, maybe someone has some comforting words.

Two years ago I started seeing these little dots over people’s faces. They sort of look like the little bits that come off an airbrush. But, I didn’t think much of it. I have migraines and often before the migraines, I’ll see dots around. But these are different, they’re black and they follow people’s faces. They grow, all different sizes. Sometimes they’re small. Sometimes they cover the whole face. Sometimes they grow while I stare at them. Sometimes I’d see them in the car, driving past others. Sometimes I see them on people on the street. I only started getting worried about a year ago, when my dad passed.

When dad died, he was in the hospital. I was there, I watched one of those little black dots form over his face. It got bigger and they fused together. I tried to go to sleep, thinking I was going to have a migraine. Within twenty-four hours my dad was dead.

Nine months ago, one was following one of my coworkers. Younger kid, always quiet. He gave me a set of pens and when I looked at him from my hair, the dot was covering about half of his face. He was strange that day. Didn’t eat lunch and spent most of his day typing something. The dot grew throughout the day. He didn’t show up the next day. He took his own life.

Six months ago, I was driving along the highway and I noticed something weird. A handful of cars that passed me had those sort of black dots sitting in the seats. One in four cars, two in three cars, and three in two, and four in one. Then, there was a crash. The worse the state has seen. I remember seeing it, someone tried to pass another one and there was a pile-up affect. I pulled over to avoid joining it. I couldn’t help but look away. I watched each little black dot go out. I watched four ambulances take people away, three had black dots in them. The news said three victims of the crash died in the hospital.

One month ago, my girlfriend was getting ready to go out to the bar with her friends. The dot appeared twenty-four hours before the fire. But I had talked to my therapist about seeing the dots and he convinced me that it was all coincidence. I shouldn’t be worried about these dots. I figured I was just getting a migraine, so I kissed her good-bye and went to take a nap. Before I went to sleep, I saw that there were three dots in the car of the four friends that picked her up. Then there was the fire. Police are still investigating, but people say someone lit it. She and three of her friends died on site. I visited the last one in the hospital, even though I didn’t know them. They started to have a black dot forming on their face. I went home. They succumbed to their injuries within twenty-four hours.

Now, I keep seeing the dot. It’s there when I look up, it’s there in the mirror. And it’s growing. I started a timer when I first noticed it. If I noticed it immediately, I have two hours left. If I didn’t, maybe it’ll happen as soon as I hit post. I feel like I can hear the clock of my life winding down. I don’t know what to do, besides post about everything somewhere. Just to feel a little less alone.
