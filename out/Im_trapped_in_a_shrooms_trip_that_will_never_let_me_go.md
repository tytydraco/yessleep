I’ve been planning this shrooms trip for a few weeks now, a few days before Halloween. I’ve been taking this dose for years without any problems, and although this is a different strain—one people describe as “intense in unexpected ways”—I feel prepared. My double-brick townhouse has always been my sanctuary, and my dog, Milo, is lying beside me on the couch, his warm presence grounding me.

At first, everything unfolds the way it always does. The walls of the room breathe with me, colors deepen, and a sense of tranquility washes over me. I ask Google to play some ambient music, and as the soothing sounds fill the air, I melt into the couch. Milo looks at me with his big, loving eyes, and I feel an overwhelming wave of gratitude for this life, this moment.

Then it all goes wrong.

The colors turn harsh, and the air thickens, pressing in from all sides. The walls twist in grotesque, unsettling ways, and the room’s warm glow becomes distorted. My heart starts to race. I try to steady myself. “Google, play some chill-out music,” I say, my voice cracking. But instead of calming tones, the speakers blast harsh, heavy metal. The sound grates against my senses, a cruel assault on my already fraying mind.

I swallow hard. “Google,” I whisper, “play something uplifting.” But Google responds with a slow, haunting dirge—a broken waltz that sounds like it’s being played backward, with whispering voices threading through the melody.

My pulse thunders in my ears. This isn’t right, I think. I grab my phone, desperate to call my friend Tony. But when I dial his number, a robotic voice drones: “Your call could not be connected. Please check the number and try again.” My breath catches in my throat, and my hands shake. Before I can process what’s happening, my phone rings. Tony’s name lights up the screen. Relief floods me as I answer, but the voice on the other end isn’t Tony’s.

“Your call could not be connected,” the robotic message repeats, distorted and mocking. “Please check the number and try again.” The voice is warped, almost gleeful, as if the universe itself is laughing at my panic.

I drop the phone. Milo, usually my rock, springs to his feet and starts running frantic, desperate zoomies around the room. His nails click on the wood floor in a chaotic rhythm, and he barks wildly at empty corners. He isn’t playing—he’s terrified. The shadows in the room seem to thicken and writhe, and the air grows colder.

I’m gasping for air now, the sense of unreality crushing me. Should I call an ambulance? The thought slices through my panic, but a wave of doubt follows. What if I’m too far gone to even comprehend if they arrive? My mind conjures vivid images of paramedics standing over me, but instead of helping, they speak in riddles, their faces twisted in cruel smiles, trapping me further in this nightmare. Or worse, what if they’re not real at all?

Then I hear it: a low, mocking voice that oozes out from the walls. “Call for help,” it taunts, “but no one will save you here.” The laughter that follows is sickening, a deep, guttural sound that makes my stomach twist. The darkness feels alive, malicious, and it’s feeding on my fear.

I close my eyes, clutching Milo as he whimpers. Please, I beg, please let this end.

And then, slowly, the nightmare begins to loosen its grip.

The music fades into silence. The shadows recede. The clock on the wall holds steady, and the suffocating air lightens. Milo, still trembling, curls up beside me, and I exhale in a sob of relief. Everything is okay. The trip is over. I’ve survived.

Over the next few days, I process the experience. It’s been the most terrifying trip of my life, but I feel stronger for having made it through. I focus on grounding myself, getting back into my routine, and even go on long walks with Milo, grateful for the crisp October air. Halloween comes and goes, and the holiday’s eerie spirit fades. Life feels normal again.

Then, the day after Halloween, I wake up feeling more centered than ever. The nightmare is behind me, and I’m ready to share my new outlook on life. I pick up my phone and dial Tony, eager to tell him how grateful I feel to have come through the experience.

But instead of the ringing tone, I hear that same robotic message: “Your call could not be connected. Please check the number and try again.” My heart stops. Dread creeps in, slow and suffocating. I try to convince myself it’s just a glitch, but I can’t shake the feeling of déjà vu.

Setting the phone down, I turn to the clock on the wall. 2:45 PM. I look away, trying to shake off the anxiety. When I look back, the numbers are shifting: 11:11 PM. Then 5:45 AM. 8:39 PM. My stomach drops, and my blood turns cold.

Then, the phone rings. Tony’s name lights up the screen. With a trembling hand, I answer.

“Your call could not be connected,” the voice says, its tone distorted and cruel. “Please check the number and try again.”

The mug I’m holding slips from my hands and shatters on the floor. Milo backs away, his ears flat, and the shadows begin creeping back across the room. My chest tightens, and I realize, with a deep, soul-crushing terror, that I have never really escaped.

The nightmare isn’t over. It has just let me believe it was. And reality is dissolving around me once more, leaving me trapped in a place where I can never trust what is real.
