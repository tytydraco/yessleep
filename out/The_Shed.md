I awoke to a sliver of light, coming through a crack in the boarded window. It must have been morning, or afternoon I have lost all concept of time. My eyes adjusted to the dim light. I was in a shed again. the Small puddle of bile, reeked when i realized I threw up again last night. in this shed, was a old dirty mattress, a dirty pillow. a thin blanket with holes in one corner. in the other corner is a desk, with a broken chair along with a bucket used to release myself, the desk always had a fresh tray of food, and a fresh flower. Although I never knew how they put it there. I stood up and patted my xtra large T-shirt that was covered in dirt and bile.

I walked over to the desk. I heard the clinking of the chain attached to my leg as i walked to the desk and scarfed down the food. it was pancakes, eggs, and orange juice today. on the wall was a calendar but it was obviously the wrong date and year. I looked at the small marks next to it that I dug into the wall. twenty one days in this shed, I've tried multiple times to escape but the chains are too thick and the door is boarded up now. The camera in the corner watches my every move. 

I walk back to the mattress and pick up the books next to it. I've already read them multiple times but I don't have much to do in here. I read a little and then pace the 4 foot by 8 foot square shed. every day is the same.  I sit at the desk and pick at the petals of the fresh flower. a pile of dead dried petals sit on the ground next to the desk. I decide to sing like I do all the time, then i hear a scream. "You cant keep me here, I don't belong here." a voice says I rush to the window and look through the crack. I see the other 10 sheds, and hear "LET ME OUT" must be the new girl. theres now 10 of us in 10 different sheds. 

"theres no use, stop screaming" the other girl says. "LET ME OUT" the new girl screamed. then the eight other girls screamed back. they did this to mock the newbies. to show that no matter how loud you scream, no one is coming for you. I just sit there in silence and fear. knowing I was the first girl. I was all alone at one point Screaming so much i ripped my vocal cords. that was twenty two days ago now. Girl #2 showed up on day 5. Girl #3 on day 7, Girl 4 on 10, girl 5 on day 13, girl number 6 on day 15, so on and so on till now. twenty two and girl number 10 is here.  I tried to talk again but like always the hoarseness of my chords just let out a light screech. the other girls knew i was here. i just assumed they assumed i didn't speak. I went back to my desk. "LET ME OUT LET ME GO" the girl kept screaming through out the day. day became night and eventually. I fell asleep. the next day, I woke up and repeated my routines. read, pace, read, pace, sit eat. everyday was the same as the last. I had no idea when or if we would be let go.  

10 days later. 



I awoke, to the sound of a dog barking, and a couple talking. 



"babe, look at those cabins" the woman said 



"oh my they're so cute," she said as she walked closer. 



the new girl almost screamed, but before she could the current started. silencing us. unable to scream. The dog however, started crying. he barked at the Sheds. kept barking. but the couple kept walking. I looked out the small opening to try to see them, but couldn't see them. Then "HELP US" came from the other sheds. hoping the couple would hear us. I heard the dog bark again then I heard a yelp, I knew even if the couple did hear us. they were gone, I started to panic, what if they had a phone, what if they sent a picture of the sheds to someone. I realized it was a long shot, but maybe someone heard us. we would be saved.  I would be able to go home, I would be okay. thirty three days here or more. the little glimpse of hope got to me. I decided it was time to try and break free of this place. I looked around the area to see if there was anything to get out. I knew I couldn't just try to escape. I was being watched by someone. 

I decided to break my routine. I looked around the shed. I took the inventory. 

Three warn books, a calendar, A tray, a bucket, an old blanket, a glass vase. I had to get out of the shackle around my leg. I had to get out of the door or window.  I looked at the inventory.  I looked at the mattress. i decided to take the book and pretend to read facing away from the camera. i took the vase and broke it. " What was that" i heard one of the girls say. I used the glass to cut open the mattress. I put the rest of the small glass under the mattress. I cut the spring out of the mattress. a thin metal thing but I used the spring and tried to flatten some of it out. 

on the shackle was a lock, I didn't know how to pick it. but I had to try. I knew enough to put two pieces of metal in it. but no luck. I decided to try other methods after hours of trying to pick the lock. i hid everything under the pillow. and walked away. I got up and walked to the window to look out. I didn't see anything at first. but then i saw the feet of the couple and the dog. which means they were dead.  i walked back to the desk and looked around for anything else I could use. i felt around the back, and felt a loose nail in the wall. I pulled the desk out a little and pulled the nail.  The nail came out. it was a long nail. I went back to the things and tired to think of how to escape. I scanned the room again I felt around the floor. anything that could help me. i felt a loose floorboard, but couldn't get a hold of it. 

by now it was getting dark. i decided to go to bed, hopfully to get some sleep.  the next day, i went to the window, i took the nail and the old tray which was hidden under my bed.  I swung the tray at the window. Nothing. I swung again. nothing. the windows didnt break. i swung again. this time tho, the window broke. i took the blanket and wrapped it around my hand. i punched the broken window. It broke all the way this time but the wood boards were still there. the other girls must have heard me cause i heard banging. they somehow did the same thing as me, breaking the windows. 

I tried to push at the board, it was a little loose. then remembered i wouldnt be able to leave unless I got unshackled. I sat back down, worked at the lock with the nail and the bent spring. i kept trying for hours until I heard a click. I almost didn't believe it at first, but the lock came loose. I was free, i went back to the window. i pushed the board, again. i hit it as hard as i could the nails were coming out. I went again and again. until the board came loose and fell. I went to the desk and grabbed the chair. the window was just big enough to get out of. I squeezed through it, preparing myself for the fall. I managed to get out and then Crack. i landed on my shoulder, i screamed but this time it came out. the wail broke out. I was out, i was free. I walked to the shed over I hear movement in the cabin. i try the door and to my surprise. it opens, the girl inside screams. 

I get a tap on my shoulder, and i turn around. 



I feel hands around my eyes, the goggles lifted from my face. the vision is blinded by the neon lights and the room, I was now in what looks like an arcade. "babe, you were in that game for almost an hour. but you beat the High Score by 1 minute.  You escaped the Shed!  The room had 9 other booths, with 9 other girls hooked up to the goggles, the girl that screamed, had her goggles taken off shortly after. since she escaped with the help of me opening the door. 

"it was just a game? it felt so real, oh my goodness that was intense. it felt so real" I repeated,  I started to get a grasp onto the reality again and I remember now,  The acid they give you makes it feel even more real. I started walking out of the booth. ready to leave, then I felt the familiar cold metallic cuff around my leg. I looked down as I began to panic again a piece of paper floated down, landing in front of me. 

on the piece of paper. 



LEVEL 2: THE ARCADE STARTS NOW.
