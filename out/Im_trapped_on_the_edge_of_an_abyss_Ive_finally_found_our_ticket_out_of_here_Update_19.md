The wheels on our cart rattled and groaned over the weathered asphalt as we approached the compound door. It was tired from so many trips to and from this place, and I was too.

I prayed it would finally be the last.

My heart beat heavy as we drew near to the circle of light beneath it, however. I didn’t know how this deal was going to go, and there was no guarantee that if we complied, Ann was actually going to let us in. Right now, she held all the cards, but this body was an equally powerful hand, and we needed to play it right if we stood even the slightest chance of beating her.

I was also relieved as we passed the gauge that it hadn’t moved at all since we left it.

The poor scientist in the trolley had given out long before I’d gotten to June. Apparently flopping herself into the cart was one of the last acts of her waking mind. She didn’t look like she was breathing, and shamefully, I was too afraid to check for a pulse.

Odds were, she wasn’t going to wake back up, and even if she was somehow still alive, I didn’t think she’d feel what was about to come next. At least, I hoped she didn’t…

Because we really didn’t have any other choice…

I stopped before the door’s speaker and pounded a fist to the button, ringing a buzzer before the speaker crackled to life.

“Ann! Ann, where are you? We’ve got your damn body.” I hissed with pure hatred.

It took a moment to get a response, presumably since she was away on the other end. After a beat though, her voice rang back through calm and—ironically—almost guilt laden, “You’re alive… I’m glad to see that, Hen. I really am—”

“Where is Hope?” I barked, no patience for her bullshit, “Is she okay?”

“She’s… fine.” Ann told me, the slightest hesitation in her voice.

I shook my head, “Why are you lying?”

That kicked her tone up an octave, “What do you—? I’m not lying, *Hensley.* She’s alive and with me.”

“Bullshit. I know our lying voice, Ann. It’s the exact reason I’ll know if you try to mimic her, so don’t even bother.”

There was a long pause, and a palpable tension in the air.

“Ann?” I snapped.

“She’s fine, Hensley. I’m not lying. That shit that got on her, though; she’s… she’s sick. It’s really bad.”

That made my rage simmer down in favor of concern, “Sick? What do you mean? What kind of ‘sick’?”

“I don’t know, Hensley! How the hell am I *supposed* to know? I don’t even know what this black stuff is!”

“Well, are you taking care of her? Or are you just shoving her into a corner since she’s only a bargaining chip to you?” I asked, pounding my fist on the wall in frustration. My heart was thundering in my chest with worry, and it was killing me that there was nothing I could do to help.

“I’m doing the best I fucking can! God, do you really think I’m that much of a monster that I’d just let her suffer like that?”

“Do I really need to answer that?” I snickered incredulously, “You are literally leaving us here to die!”

There was another bout of silence between us, and I clenched my fist tight. What I’d just said had gotten to her. Though she had already committed to this route, it was clear that she was already feeling regret in some sense.

That last look to me at the elevator showed me that. Same with her tone of voice when she’d just picked up a moment ago. But looking even further, there was the conversation we had before back in the control room. I’d reassured her that we were all leaving together, and she’d gotten weird about it. She’d had a nervous, shameful air about her, like she was wrestling with what she was about to do.

It wasn’t nearly enough for me to feel any sort of forgiveness toward her, but it did remind me that while Ann was angry and impulsive, she still had a soft side, and I was only pushing her further from it with my jabs and insults. If I wanted her to hold up her deal, I needed to stay in good graces.

With a deep sigh, I swallowed my pride and spoke, “Look, I’m sorry, I… I believe you, I do.” I lied, “I’m just stressed given everything. I think I have a right to be. Plus, that last rig was… well, I’m sure you can imagine given that it was The Warehouse.”

After a few more seconds, Ann spoke, guilt once again behind her voice, but masked by her usual apathy, “Whatever. It doesn’t matter. Did you get the body?”

“We have it,” I said, looking at the camera and gesturing to it, “Now are you going to hold up your end of the deal?”

“My deal was that I get out of here first, then open the door for you. I can open it from the drill, but I can’t do that until you dump the body.”

I gritted my teeth. I knew she was right, but just because she had already laid out her dumb rules, it didn’t make them fair, “Ann, we don’t have time for this; that thing coming for us is going to be here any hour now. We need in *now.* Open the door, and you can dump it inside.”

“I can’t trust you with that, Hensley.”

“Ann, come on!” I growled, throwing my head back, “I refuse to believe there isn’t some way you can let us in there and keep us restrained until you get out! Do you really want us to get killed by that *thing*?”

Another pause, then, “That won’t happen if you just dump the corpse. I’ll get the drill running in under an hour, then you can come inside.”

I took a deep breath to keep from lashing at her, then looked to June for help. As usual, she looked lost as ever, so I turned back. Knowing full well that I was taking a huge risk of being locked out completely by telling her, I played my next card.

“Ann, we might not even be here in an hour… I dreamt of that *thing* before the last rig. It… It saw me this time.”

Ann didn’t respond for a long beat. She didn’t seem prepared for all the strings attached to her when she shut us outside, and now that she was having to cut them loose, I could tell she was having a hard time.

Finally, she returned the most neutral, blunt answer she could, “Just drop the body, Hensley.”

With all options expended, I resorted to one last tactic. One last shot in the dark to try to get through the barrier before us. I called her bluff.

“I’m not doing it.”

“Hensley,” Ann warned, “I told you before why you don’t want to play this game.”

“I know you did. And if you really want to dump Hope down that cold steel chute, then do it. If you can really live with yourself after this, then take the easy way out. But I don’t think you can, Ann. I think even under all of that determination to get out, even something so directly heinous and evil is beyond you.”

That stunned her into another hiatus from the mic. A frustrated silence at being caught out. I was right, and that put us at a stalemate. At least, it did momentarily.

“Maybe you’re right. But I still have time on my side. You just told me that ‘Ill-belly-aga’ or whatever is coming, and I’m still safe in here. Even if you refuse, I still have Hope, and I don’t know if she’s going to make it much longer. Even if it takes a month for her to pass, I’ll have her one way or another to fuel this machine, and because all us clones come from the ‘roots’ attached to you, I’m sure it’ll be more fuel than that corpse you’ve already brought.”

The only part of her words I really heard were the ones regarding Hope, and it brought my anger back like hellfire, “Damn it, Ann, you told me she was fine!”

“She’s alive, Hensley, and if you want to see her that way again before she goes, you’ll drop. The fucking. *Body*.”

Tears welled in my eyes, and I tightened my fist so hard I think my nails cut into my palm. It was stupid to be so affected by it. Hope probably wouldn’t have wanted me to do it either. But I already missed my positive self. The version of me that I wished I was. If I was going to die in this place, all I wanted was to see what I could have been one last time. Tell her I was so sorry for letting her down.

What made it worse was not knowing. Ann could be bluffing for all we knew, and Hope could be fine. On the other hand, she could really be sick, and Ann might just not be helping her like we could. Maybe we could save her somehow. Get her back to health and really live the rest of our days here between the three of us.

Either way, all roads led back to one outcome.

Too tired to fight any longer, and with no other options, I turned to June.

“Dump the body,” I said softly.

Her eyes widened, and she fidgeted with the sides of her hoodie, “A-Are you sure? What if—”

“Yes, June. Do it.”

I moved over as she popped the hatch, then grabbed one side of the body. I gripped the other. The stench of death and rot belched up from the pit into my already watery eyes, making me scowl them in defeat. With little patience, I yanked the legs of the woman up onto the lip of the hatch, June heaved the shoulders, and together, she jammed her inside.

*THUNG, Thump, thud!*

I listened to the poor woman slam into the sides of the chute all the way down before a mechanical whir met her at the bottom. June and I stood in solemn silence and waited before the gauge’s LEDs lit up.

The bar was full completely now. We’d finally done it. We’d filled the drill.

There was little fanfare to it. Not even a sigh of relief from me. June just stayed frozen while I stomped back over to the speaker and jammed the button.

“There. It’s done. You got your stupid wish. Now please, Ann… Let us inside…”

It took a moment for her to return too, “Alright. Give me some time. I’ll open up for you soon, just stay near and listen for the door.”

I growled behind my words, “How long is a bit?”

She ignored me, pausing in thought before saying, “I suppose this is our last time speaking.”

She said it almost distantly, the gravity of her actions pulling her words into a slow, hazy orbit. There was a lot in the silence that trailed her sentence, though I didn’t know exactly what kind. She was holding back from saying more, maybe to gloat, maybe to apologize, maybe to throw one last spiteful jab my way just to really hammer home how much I messed up.

I think she knew that no matter what she said to me in that moment, however good or bad, it made her a lesser person than she already was, so all she gave was a weak, “Goodbye, Hensley.”

She released the button, then I did too, stepping back and releasing a tired ghost from my mouth against the cold abyss air.

For the next few minutes, I stared at the door. I knew it wasn’t going to open so soon, but I didn’t care. I was waiting anyway. Eventually, June’s uncomfortable shuffles next to me became too annoying, and I decided to move to one of the back doors of the mall outlet behind us and step inside.

It was a clothing store, so the first thing I did was find the closest thing to a shall that I could and tied up a sling for my broken arm with June’s help. It was painful loading the limb inside, and the sling itself only offered more discomfort in the way that it cradled it, but it was still better than the arm dangling free, the fracture cracking and scraping against itself with every movement.

I was glad I couldn’t roll the sleeve back and check the swollen, purple skin beneath, because I’m sure the internal bleeding would have stressed me even more than I already was.  

After that, the two of us waited in utter silence, the only illumination coming from the floodlight bleeding under the back door. My stomach felt sick with anticipation as we sat there, waiting to hear the gears of the door finally chugging along its track. The more minutes that ticked on, the more anxious I got. What if she couldn’t open the door and use the drill at the same time? What if she was lying to us and never had an intention of letting us in at all?

June rudely snapped me from my anxiety by calling out, “Hey, Hensley?”

“Yeah?” I weakly returned.

“Did… she suffer?”

“What?”

“The Hensley back at The Warehouse… When you killed her did she…?”

My guts made knots at the bluntness of her question. ‘Killed her’. It was accurate, but still, it shocked me to actually hear aloud. I didn’t really know how I was supposed to respond to that, so I deflected in hopes she’d back down.

“Why are you asking that?”

She shifted a little in the dark from nerves, but pressed on anyway, “I don’t know, I guess I just was curious. She may have been different, but she was still one of us, you know?”

“She tried to kill us, June.” I noted.

My clone didn’t respond to that one, the heat in my voice urging her to back down. I knew that was my goal to begin with, but seeing her fold just reminded me of my guilt, so I closed my eyes and lay my head back against the wall.

“I did what I could. To make sure that she was calm when it happened.”

June didn’t know what the nuances of that sentence meant, but it seemed good enough for her. she perked back up and nodded, then revealed to me the real reason I believed she asked the question.

“Hope got covered in the same stuff she was… And Ann said she wasn’t doing well.”

My knotted stomach tied a full bow. I swallowed hard.

“Yeah…”

“Do you think it’ll do to her what it did to that version of us?”

My eyes shut again, trying not to think about it, “No. No—Hope is already formed. That last Hensley was grown inside of it. That’s why she came out so messed up.”

“If it got inside of her wounds, though—”

“Ann said she was just sick, June. She’ll be okay, her body just needs to flush it out.”

“But Hensley, what are we going to do if we get to Hope and can’t fix her?”

“*June.”* I spit, begging her to stop talking.

I saw her shrink back against the wall.

“There’s already enough going on as is. We don’t need more to stress over right now.”

“Sorry…” June mournfully offered.

I shook my head and took a few deep breaths, trying to stop my heart from racing in my chest. After too long of failing, my frustration got the better of me, and I pounded my head backward against the wall, “God! What is taking her so long!?”

The question left my mouth and lingered in the air between June and I, but as it continued to echo its dire pertinence, it struck a chord in my brain that made me sit up straight. I sucked the thought back in with a shallow breath and pondered something.

Why did Ann need so long to get the drill running?

She had all the time in the world while we were sleeping and at that last rig to get things set up, and Ann wasn’t the type to sit around and do nothing in that time. She was always urging us to the next rig and coming up with plans like the one to scale the cliffs. She was driven. She was stubborn. Sure, she’d get fed up with things and pretend she was over it in her tantrums, but ultimately Ann was someone who needed to figure things out and get things done.

I had worked the systems at the rigs, and it wasn’t complicated to find functions as simple as ‘run a system’ or ‘turn on/off machine’, even if you didn’t know the scientific jargon around here. Everything was labeled plainly, and for someone like Ann—who had been able to figure out the door code—she should have had no trouble firing up the drill.

She was stuck on something. She didn’t know how to get it working. She was still missing a piece of the puzzle.

I launched to my feet, “June, we need to move.”

“Huh?” She grunted, turning to the door and furrowing her brow, “I don’t hear the door, is it—”

“That door isn’t going to open anytime soon. Ann lied to us.”

“What? How do you know?”

“She doesn’t know how to work the drill. If she did, she would have had it going by now. She’s been desperate to leave this place from the moment she woke up; she wouldn’t slow down now.”

“What if it just takes a while to boot up?” June panicked, “Isn’t it like a gateway through dimensions or something?”

“Maybe it does,” I answered, “but if it doesn’t, we’re burning time that we don’t have. If she doesn’t get that thing working before the beast at the bottom of the cliff shows up, we’re not getting away from it at all.”

“What do you want us to do, then?” June said, skittishly clambering to her feet.

“June figured out that door code on her own somehow, and she did it while we were all still together. That means the answer has to be in town somewhere.”

“We don’t have the laptop anymore, though,” my clone pointed out, “If she got it from anywhere, it had to be in there, right?”

I thought about it and cursed under my breath. She was right. Ann had the laptop out that night we slept in the hospital rig, and even before that back at the tower before we scaled the cliffs. She must have found something on Shae’s files that gave her a tip-off.

“We don’t, no,” I growled in frustration, “But I know where we can find more.”

June and I flew back into the alley, and I glared up at the camera one last time before we took off down the road.

My eyes were fixed on the tower’s light the entire time as our feet pattered the dark street like ticks of a clock. My arm was on fire as it bounced in its sling, but I hardly noticed with my brain so tunneled in on our new goal.

We had a chance here. One last try to yank the rug out from under Ann and escape this place.

We burst through the tower lobby and over to the maintenance door leading to the tunnels, taking them down and starting through the corridors. The walk through the hall had felt long before, but now it felt like we were running on a conveyor belt with every second ticking closer to our death. We finally rounded the corner into the office tunnel and started down, but I hesitated when I saw lights shining down in our direction.

June and I quickly ducked back behind the wall, and I peered out one more time cautiously, squinting my eyes.

They weren’t just any lights; they were headlights.

“What is it?” June whimpered beside me.

I didn’t respond. Only regarded the machine a moment longer before stepping out and continuing down the corridor.

“Hensley!” June gasped in a harsh whisper, as if her words were a rope that would lasso me back.

It had no effect. I continued forward before calling, “Hello?”

Maybe it was dumb, but something about the scene didn’t scream immediate danger, and even if it did, we were dead women in five different ways at this point. What was one more?

There was no response, and I was halfway there by now. I called again to still no answer, and by then, June had begun to follow. When I finally reached the end of the corridor and saw what I was looking at, I was more curious than afraid.

It was the golf cart used to travel the halls faster, somehow turned on and running. I circled the thing as if it were a bomb, noting every aspect of it before finally moving close to look at the dash. Its battery was half, and it was silently idling, waiting for a driver to take it for a long-awaited spin.

“Wasn’t… Wasn’t this thing out of juice last time we came through?” June questioned, doing the same 5-point inspection that I’d just done. “Ann sat in it and everything.”

“It was.” I confirmed before whipping my head around the space. The dark office was completely vacant and unnaturally silent. Suddenly, all the cubicles in the room looked much more intimidating. A labyrinth that any sort of Minotaur could be roaming.

At least, that was my first instinct that had been drilled into me by this place. As my eyes looked at the staircase to the door out to the motel, I had a different thought. I looked up and shone my flashlight at the ceiling. On the yellowed ceiling tiles, there were various sharp lines and patterns where colors looked lighter and lighter.

“The vending machines,” I pondered, “We’re in the anomaly zone of the motel.”

“What does that mean?” June asked.

“I think this golf cart must have gotten the vending machine treatment. Shifted to a different instance; an older one before it ran out of power.”

June got a look of worry on her face, “I-Is it dangerous to be standing here? Should we move?”

I shook my head, “We’re safe. Hope and I stood near this area a lot before you came along. We do need to keep moving, though,” I turned to her and looked in her eyes, “Spread out and start looking around for anything important, okay? Anything that might be a code or a clue how to get into that bunker. I’m going to start digging through a computer.”

June fidgeted at her coat sides before nodding and moving to the nearest cubical.

I moved to one too with a computer still present, then clicked it on. As it booted with a logo that I’d never seen before, I moved my lips in a silent plea that these laptops would function the same as computers back in the real world. My heart felt relief when the device booted into a log-in screen like I’d hoped.

I figured if they bothered having signal in this place, there had to be a reason for the central servers, which meant as long as we had the login info, we might be able to access Shae’s account even without his laptop. I had his password, I just needed a username, which luckily looked like it was going to be easy.

The username of the device's true user was already saved into the login bar, giving me an example, and it appeared to be their first and last name with a dot between them, followed by ‘Kingfisher’. I couldn’t help but snicker to myself at how bureaucratic this organization was for the kind of work they were doing.

The issue was that I didn’t have Shae’s full name still, so I stepped away from the computer and began to roam the room, looking for any paperwork on the walls, any time cards, or any sort of list that might give me the bastards full title.

When I didn’t see anything, I moved over to the break area with the kitchen, then noticed a door that we’d never seen before. It was tucked in such a way that you would only really see it from the main office space, and since the rest of the room had been the most interesting part each time we’d been here, none of us had ever noticed.

I crossed over and pressed it open. Inside looked to be an extension of the break area, this part being the lounge with all the tables and chairs. There was something else here though; a set of nice, wooden lockers like those of a country club lining the far wall. On them, a placard read all the names of employees, including one at the end for the man I was looking for.

I made note of Shae’s first name, then turned to leave, but hesitated when I realized that there could be more of use in here. I moved over to his locker and reached into my pack, yanking out my pry bar and stabbing it into the crack of the door.

It was difficult with only one arm, but after shoulder checking it a couple of times, the beautifully crafted wood shattered away like cheap furniture as the latch broke off.

Within, there wasn’t much of use. There was some spare shoes that looked to be for more manual labor, a couple of jackets and a spare lab coat. Pieces of a puzzle to a story I only needed to know the end of.

Something that did catch my eye in the clutter of papers and trinkets at the bottom of the locker was something emitting a steady, blinking light.

I scooped the small device into my hand to see it was a pager with a tiny screen and LED indicator. It flashed repeatedly in warning, and in clicking a button on it, the display glowed to life with the words ‘*10 new Emails’.*

I eyed the little thing in my hand, trying to gauge the significance when June made me jump from behind.

“Everything okay?” she called.

“Jeez, June, you scared the shit out of me!” I gasped, spinning to face her.

She lowered her head, “Sorry, I just heard a loud noise in here and was worried. It scared me too.”

I shook my head, “I’m okay, I was just checking Shae’s locker. You find anything yet?”

June shook her own, “Not yet. I thought you were looking at the computers?”

“Yeah, I’m about to. Just needed Shae’s name,” I told her, looking down at the pager and clicking the button again. I thought it would cycle the messages, but it only cleared the emails before letting me know that was all. If Shae had already cleared his feed past them, I wondered if those emails had come in after everything fell apart.

“That person who you said left the note at the beginning of this; do you remember their name?” June questioned, eyeing the wall behind me.

I furrowed my brow, then thought, “There was Juarez, but the person who left the note at the door was ‘Brand’ I think. Why, what’s up?”

She moved closer and skimmed the lockers, “They were all the only people left after this place fell. If anyone had a head start on doing what we’re doing, it would have been them. They may have left something behind, wouldn’t you think?”

“I think we may have found everything they left already, but let’s keep looking,” I told her, “You may be onto something.”

I moved back into the main space, then typed in Shae’s login information, pressing enter and holding my breath. The loading that followed took a heart-pounding amount of time, so much so that I feared my plan might not work after all. In the other room while I waited, I heard June cracking open lockers, sifting through the other boxes that I’d neglected, and just when I was about to give up and go aid her, the laptop finally booted in.

Before me was the same home screen that had greeted us on Shae’s laptop, all of his files uploaded onto some sort of abyssal cloud system. I didn’t really know where to begin at first, so I just began opening any file immediately available. All of them were only reports of data or rig statistics that had been saved for one reason or another, and as I opened his file explorer, I saw that with the amount on this damn thing, it was going to take more time than we had to sift through all of them.

I chewed my cheek for a moment, then my frantic brain sparked off the information it’d just been given.

I opened Shae’s email.

This too, took a while to load, but once it did, the application greeted me to the doctors archive of all his mail. Shae was clearly an organized, punctual man, with barely any letters left unread, and all of them organized into neat little tabs on the side bar. Like the pager had told me, though, Shae had ten new emails, and looking at his inbox, I was right. Shae must have never had time to check them before getting thrown into a fight for his life.

Eight of them were listed under a tab that read *‘Rig Diagnostics & Alerts’*. I opened that tab first, out of curiosity, and was surprised by what I saw. Some of the emails were very recent, with one even being sent that very day. Clicking on it, I saw how.

They were automated. There was some sort of system connected to the rigs that was sending updates when something went wrong, and the one that had been sent a few hours ago alerted that the system in the Warehouse had been shut down improperly. Same with the one before that, and the two before that one, each to varying degrees based on how badly we screwed up the rig.

The ones before those four were not us, however. They each read slightly different. Alerts that a cell swap was initiated, but an improper one was reinserted and causing issues. Each one was roughly sent a day apart, and I got a chill on the back of my neck when I realized that I was staring at a real-time log of when Shae stuffed his poor colleagues into the machines.

All of it was interesting, but not necessary, and I’d seen enough ‘interesting’ things by now to last me a lifetime. Clicking out of the email, I moved to the tab with the remaining two emails labeled *‘System Updates’* and clicked into it.

My gut felt a jolt of lightning run through it, and my body felt weightless.

Inside the inbox, there were two pieces of mail, but each had the same title.

*‘Alert: Central Compound Door Code Change.’*

I was so frantic to click it that I missed the boxes entirely and accidentally clicked into a whole new tab.

When I did correctly reach the email, my eyes sprinted over the words:

*‘You are receiving this message as you are authorized with full administration privileges. The following information is to be kept private and is only to be known by authorized personnel:*

*The central door code of your facility has been changed to* ***114080*****,** *and the previous code has been cleared from your system. If you or an authorized employee did not make this change and suspect an error, contact a head admin IMMEDIATELY to have it corrected, as foul play may be involved.’*

I couldn’t believe it; it was right there. The code to the door was hidden in Shae’s email the entire time, all on the hinge of an automated system. It all made sense now why the other scientists were trying so hard to get into his laptop, or maybe they never knew to begin with and were just trying to do what we did. Whatever the case, I couldn’t help but kick myself for not being more thorough. In a place with barely any signal, I never would have thought to check something as simple as a digital inbox.

Apparently, Ann did, though. By the looks of the second code change, she also thought to change the code again, just in case.

I snatched a sticky note off the table next to me and jotted the code down, just in case. Whirling on my heels, I was about to run to June, but stopped when I saw her already heading for me.

Before I could speak, she gave me a proud smile and held something up. I was tempted to cut her off, but it was seeing her in that moment that I realized I’d never actually seen June smile before. Ever since we’d gotten here, she’d always had that sad, pathetic look. It was enough for me to give her the floor.

“I found something!” she exclaimed, rushing over and holding out the thing pinched between her fingers.

I held out my hand for her to drop it, and when she did, I turned the thing over in my hand.

It was a key, but not a standard house one. It had a plastic cup built around it where the metal part sprouted from, the kind of key used on machines and tools to protect the important part. At the end of the plastic, there was a loop for a key ring, and on that ring was a single shell-protected tag.

On it, in nice handwriting, was one word.

‘*Drill’*

“No way…” I muttered, “June, you—where did you find this!?”

“In that Brand guy’s locker!” She squealed happily, “This is it! You were right! The piece that Ann is missing!”

“Shae must have taken the original with him,” I muttered, placing the key back into her hand and squeezing both tightly, “Brand must have been second in charge, or something—that’s why Shae had to change the code!”

“So if we find that, we can actually do this.”

I held up my sticky note with a wicked grin, “We already did.”

June’s face went blank with shock, then a smile came back to her, “A-Are you serious? We have it all?”

I nodded, “We have everything we need to flip the script on her. If we do this right, we can take the compound back from her, grab Hope, and get out of here before she has time to stop us.”

“How are we going to restrain her? She might still try to stop us even when we get back home, and we don’t know where we’re going to end up when we go through.”

I nearly got whiplash at how hard June hit the brakes on my excitement. My brow furrowed and I shook my head, “What? What do you mean?”

“What are we going to do when with her when we get home? After everything, I know we can’t really keep her around, but—”

“June, what are you talking about? Ann is *not* coming back with us?”

I could see the train finally screech on June’s tracks too. Her smile faded back to her usual dismal face, and she spoke softly, “Hen, we aren’t just going to leave her here…”

“June, she was going to leave *us* here. She would have by now if she had this key,” I reminded her, lifting the trinket and jingling it before her eyes.

The girl shyly averted her gaze and rubbed at her jacket, “No, I know that, I just…”

“You really think she’s worth saving? After everything she’s done?”

“I-I didn’t say that,” June quickly defended, looking up and pleading with her eyes, “But Hensley, you and I were at least going to have each other. Leaving her here completely alone—especially with that thing that could get her—that’s beyond inhumane.”

“She should have thought about that before she left us here to die.”

June actually surprised me by pushing back in a stern voice, “Don’t. Don’t start talking like that—you’re better than her, Hen.”

“This isn’t about being ‘better’, June—she was going to abandon us here and steal our old lives; if that’s not evil, than I don’t know what is.”

“It is. And I know that, but…”

“But what, June? What would you rather me do? Cause if we take her back home, I guarantee she doesn’t go quietly.”

June didn’t answer. She just looked at the ground as tears began to form in her eyes. By now, I was far too stressed and amped to feel guilt about yelling at her, but there was enough of a point in what she was saying for me to understand. As wicked as Ann was, she still felt remorse for what she was doing, and I suppose I would too if I left her here alone. That was grounds enough to bury the idea, but it only left one other.

The words uttered out like a forbidden curse, “There’s another option…”

June looked up at me, and I met her eyes, not allowing myself to finish the sentence. Like a curse, it shouldn’t be spoken aloud.

My clone eventually realized what I was implying, and shook her head in disbelief, “No… Hensley, you can’t really mean that…”

“Back at the warehouse, when I… *killed* the last clone,” I choked out, “Something happened when she died. She turned to dust and left this ghost behind or something. After a few seconds, it went into me. I think… I reabsorbed her. If I did the same thing to Ann, I don’t know if she’d actually die—at least not fully. She’d live on in me again.”

June took a step back from me, “W-What? Why didn’t you tell me any of this?”

“There wasn’t time. And frankly, there isn’t much time now, so I need you to decide, June. Our only options are to leave or kill her, because she can’t come home with us.”

“Why? Why are those our only options?” June whimpered, “You did the same thing back at the Warehouse; we didn’t know for sure, Hensley!”

That took me back. Her words landed sour in my ears, and I made a face to match, “*What*?”

June stood a little taller, and pressed back toward me, making it my turn to step back, “Back at the Warehouse, you didn’t even try any other option. That clone was one of us, and you didn’t even consider trying to talk to her. Maybe she wasn’t fully gone!”

“She tried to kill, us, June!”

“Yeah, after we pissed her off by locking her in a fucking freezer!” June hissed before clamping her hands to her mouth like I was her mom catching the curse word. I was too stunned by the outburst to interrupt, and when she saw that, her frustration carried her on before I could.

Tears began to drizzle down her cheeks, then she spoke more confidently.

“If Ann had been the first clone out instead of Hope—if that was the first part of yourself that you got to meet—would you have trusted the rest of us? Would you have wanted to take us home in the first place? You had your best foot forward with Hope, but with us, Hensley, it feels like you can barely stand to be in the same room.”

I watched as the girl choked and sniffled over the emotion stuck in her throat, wiping her face again and trying to hold her composure. While she did, I reflected briefly on what she said.

My first instinct upon seeing Hen 5 was immediate violence. No attempt to try and communicate, no consideration that she might still be lucid in there somewhere; just pure, malicious intent. Hell, I was ready to leave her to die in a freezer if she hadn’t broken out. Sure, I could convince myself that she was dangerous based on the monster she’d single-handedly crushed, but it was exactly that. *A monster.* And she only attacked us because we provoked her.

I could call killing her just a means of survival, and that was undoubtedly part of it, but I’d be lying if I said all that screaming I did at her in her final moments wasn’t coming from somewhere.

June was barely talking to me anymore as her words spilled out, too swept up in the emotion of what she was saying to address me directly, “I know that you hated that part of ourselves, and I know that after everything that’s happened, Ann is just as bad. And I know that I’m the weak, cowardly version of yourself that you would rather not be stuck with right now, but—”

I crumbled into myself, “June, I didn’t mean—”

“We’re still you, Hensley,” June said curtly. It was sharp with intent, her familiar green pools once again finding my own. “Good or bad, we’re still you. You may have been us first, but we all made the same mistakes, we all felt the same regret, and every single one of us lost the same Mom.”

I winced a bit at that last slap, and my hand instinctively moved to the edge of my jacket where my fingers began dancing over the canvas.

“I know we’re hard to deal with, and I know you hated living with us for all these years because *we did too*. The pain made us all come out of the fire baked in different ways, but the clay is all the same. We’re all Hensley. *That’s* why I can’t kill her or leave her to die. Because I know the hurt that made her jaded enough to lock us out of the compound is the same kind that makes *me* a sniveling, scared piece of crap, and the same one that made Hensley 5 into a monster, and the same hurt that made *you* into somebody you can’t stand to be around.”

June sucked in one last gulp of air to steady herself, then let the last of her words trickle from her lips like a desperate prayer.

“We’ve already hurt each other our whole lives, Hen. Just once, could we try not to? I could leave someone like Shae here to die, but us?” the girl that looked exactly like me shook her head, with a deep, sincere frown, “We’re just scared and lost. Even the worst of us doesn't deserve this.”

I didn’t know what to say to her. My mouth just hung loose, trying to think of how to rebuttal that. I was trying to not let her words get to me, but now there was too much to think about, and it threw a wrench into my simple plan of spiting Ann and getting the hell out of here.

I stood like that for a while until all that came out was a soft whisper.

A whisper that made my heart skip a beat.

Because it wasn’t just one whisper. It was two, then four, then dozens, all overlapping one another and vying for attention.

Whispers that weren’t my own.

June noticed them soon after me, and the progress that was almost made between us slipped through our fingers in a harsh burn as we moved to stand near one another. It had to wait. Everything needed to wait. My head snapped to the tunnel as another sound began coming from it.

Cracking.

Harsh, gritty and loud; bones snapped and popped from within the tunnel, and the two of us watched in horror as lights in the corridor began rapidly strobing back to life, as if quaking in fear from the beast stalking below them. They glowed along with it by some supernatural force as its colossal form crept slowly closer and closer. I couldn’t make it out in the sparse, dim flickers, but I didn’t need to see any details to know what it was.

Time was up.

Il-Belliegħa was here.
