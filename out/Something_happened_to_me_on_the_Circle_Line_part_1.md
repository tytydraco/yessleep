This is something that happened to me last year.

Or, I think it did. 

Truth be told, I’m still not sure if this was real, or if I remember it right, but it’s been eating at me so I figured I’d write it down so it isn’t just in my head anymore. I’m posting it because part of me hopes that I’m not alone, that *someone* else has seen something even a little bit like what I have. 

Like I said, this was last year, early December. My friend Jess had just got out of uni for the holidays, and I was going to meet her. I don’t want to say exactly where she was coming from, but the plan was for me to meet her at St. Pancras, getting there via the Circle Line. 

Well, I say ‘friend’. We weren’t super close around this time, or at least it didn’t really feel like it. I hadn’t seen her in person or even over video call in about a year, and we only messaged each other sporadically. 

Truth be told, I was a little nervous about seeing her. I didn’t really know if it would go well, or if she even still considered me a friend. I mean, She’d agreed to meet up with me, but I guess part of me was worried she only agreed out of obligation or pity or something. 

Anyway, it was about 5 in the evening when I got on the train. Right away, things felt… off. You’d expect the tube to be absolutely packed in the evening so close to the holidays, but it was completely empty. Nobody else was at the station with me, either. The whole thing felt sort of uncanny.

I get on and shoot Jess a text that I’m on my way. The doors close and the little announcement voice comes on to announce the next stop. The lights flicker for a moment. I know that sounds like nothing. Lights flicker on the tube all the time. But with the weird, empty atmosphere, it put me a little on edge. 

The first bit of the journey was nothing particularly noteworthy. But the first stop puts me even more on edge. Nobody gets  on. The platform is completely empty. Not even a pigeon picking at litter. It feels like the whole world is empty. I don’t know if I’ve ever felt as alone as I did on that train. The doors stay open for what feels like forever.

 I should have gotten off. I should have gotten off and switched to a different line, or gotten a bus or a cab or even just walked.

But at the time, I felt stupid getting worked up over an empty train and a flickery light, so I stayed. 

The train rolls into the next stop and the announcer voice comes on, crackly and indistinct, like there’s something wrong with the speakers. The doors squeak open and then suddenly slam shut. They shudder open and shut, open and shut, open and shut, and then the train jolts into motion. The sudden movement nearly knocks me over, and I barely manage to grab onto one of the support poles to stay upright. But the near-fall flings my phone out of my coat pocket and sends it sliding across the floor. 

The announcer voice comes on, even more distant and tinny, telling passengers to please report anything suspicious. The lights start flickering again, not just the ones above the door this time, but throughout the whole train. It gives me a splitting headache. I let go of the support pole and shuffle along the car to get to my phone. The lights are practically strobing by now and I’m squinting as I make my way to my phone, which is still shaking across the floor. I manage to grab it and sit down with it. The battery is horrifically low, which isn’t too much of a surprise because it’s an older phone and it has shit battery life, but what is a surprise is the time. It’s still 5:00. There’s really no way it should still be 5:00. It was 5:00 when I got on the train and we’ve been to two stops. I don’t know the exact mathematics of it but I know that can’t be right. For a brief moment, I consider the possibility that something got fucked up when it fell on the floor.

And then, with a sharp, electric crackle, the lights go out completely. Everything is completely dark, in the train and, somehow, in the tunnel as well.
