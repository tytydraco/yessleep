The first time i saw it, i was on my way to my night shift. I am a nurse at a hospital. I live in a small town so everyone works everywhere, the only acception is at my job. The night shift only ever has about one or two workers so my hours are pretty crappy. I was on Main street, 4 minutes away from my job. Thats when I saw it. 

It was a woman, she seemed to be about 5 feet tall. She was paper white. She had this long, eerie black hair. She looked the least to say… off. Her proportions were normal, i think it was just the eyes. Her eyes were far too big to be human. It looked almost as if she was wearing… a mask? Yes, a mask. There was a slightly off transition from where her face would reach her neck. 

She was on the side of the road sobbing her eyes out, i would have ran her over if i didnt see her almost glowing white skin. I nearly crashed into a tree but hit the breaks. I instantly jumped out of my car and yelled out asking if she was okay. She didn’t respond, she only continued to cry. I thought she was maybe in shock so i slowly crept over. Once i was about 5 feet away from her, she jerked her head towards me. Showing off her face, I jumped.

 I sprinted back to my car and decided to just go to work. I was a big horror movie fan, my favorite was Friday the thirteenth. I shrugged the whole situation off as a micro-nap, as i hadn’t slept much that day. For the rest of the night i didn’t come across her again. That was until, I got home.

I got home at 3:07 a.m, i put my coat in the closet. I walked to the kitchen, about to make a meal and watch whatever s on tv. I made a microwaveable meal and sighed as i sat down. 

I clicked on the tv and switched the channel a few times until i found a channel I was interested in. Thats when it happened. 

 the tv channel was interrupted by the local news station. The man on tv cleared his throat. He had a concerned look on his face, he said “uhm… we are sorry to interrupt this channel with breaking news. Almost 1.4 million reports have suddenly come in about a woman. Many explain this woman to be a pale, maybe about 110 pound woman with a off face..” 

He shuddered. I was worried, as the same thing happened to me just a few hours ago. I eagerly waited for him to continue.

He said “many people have reported this woman to have attacked them, many injured, some dead.”

I stared at the tv in shock. I wondered why i wasn’t attacked, then i remembered how i ran to the car before she could do a thing.

He continued, “We have an ongoing report to find this woman, we are actively waiting for more information and details.” 

I clicked off my tv. I was terrified. All of the sudden i heard three slow knocks. Knock….. knock…. Knock. I immediately ran to the door and looked through the peephole, there it was. It’s dark red eyes staring at me. It peeled back its mask to reveal.. a smile. A unearthly large smile. I was petrified.

I didn’t know what to do. I said “what did you want from me” it giggles.

“.you just gave me what i wanted.” She tore down my door. Thats when i remembered the lighter i had in my pocket. I immediately grabbed it out and light it. 

Her hair was wet, dripping on the floor wet. I set her hair on fire. It started to scream. A large flame pushed me. All of the sudden the world went black

Beep.. Beep.. Beep.. i woke up in the hospital to find a nurse looking over at me, worried. That worrysome look was imediatley overcame with relief. She explained to me how my house got caught on fire while i was asleep inside of it yesterday at 8:00 am. That means that i dreamed of the entire situation.

I was more than relieved in that situation. After about a week i was given the thumbs up to go home. I called my neighbor to take me to a nearby hotel until i could get an apatment. 

When my neighbor arrived we headed home. About 5 minutes away from home we saw a woman on the side of the road, she seemed to be abiut 5 feet tall with paper white skin.
