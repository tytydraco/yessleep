Strange encounter with a dog at a gas station.

Driving on a road under an elevated highway with cement trucks and black smoke spewing 10-wheelers around me, I had to make a stop at a gas station to buy some snack and use the restroom. It was midday. while this gas station always had few visitors, it was never this quiet.  No one was at the pump, and the lights were not on inside the convenience store.

&#x200B;

There was a faint banging sound that I heard only when I got out of the car. I thought it was a wind blowing on a rusted iron sheet. As I walked away from my car, I saw what was causing the sound. **It was a dog with a bucket on its head.** **It was ramming its head up against the iron sheet wall** of an old shanty shack that housed the gas station's water pump.

&#x200B;

My first thought was, poor thing. The stray probably got its head stuck in a bucket while searching for food, or worse, some cruel person may have put a bucket on it as a prank.

&#x200B;

I hesitated for about a second, but then I immediately set out to get the bucket off of the dog's head right away.  I hesitated because there were news reports of stray dogs with rabies in the area. But, I didn't want that fear to stop me from helping this poor dog.

&#x200B;

As I was walking towards it, the dog stopped ramming its head and turned to my direction. I was still several feet away, but it knew exactly which direction I was coming from.

&#x200B;

When I got a closer look,  I realized that it was not a bucket that was on its head. It was some sort of a whole-head latex mask, similar to those popular horse mask of a crudely drawn cartoon tiger. It was like a tiger drawn by a child, or someone who drew a tiger from memory. The tiger's eyes curved upward, and it also had a wide grin. The smile didn't show fangs, but instead, human-like teeth,  which somehow made it worse.

&#x200B;

I paused. As I slowed down my steps, I reconsidered pulling the smiling tiger mask off of this dog. It turned its head following my movement when I move to the side, meaning it could see just fine underneath the mask. Besides, it was a smiling tiger mask, not a bucket.

 May be it wasn't a stray, but a dog that belong to the gas station owner. I changed direction and walked towards the restroom.

&#x200B;

As I was about to do my business in a stall, I felt someone coming in the bathroom. And for once, I was relieved. Finally, another human being at this gas station. But then, something didn't feel right. The footsteps weren't heavy. It sounded like, small feet. Little feet tapping on wet floor tile. Four of them. It was the dog!

&#x200B;

The dog followed me into a bathroom? Why? Did it think I was going to help it pull off the mask or something? I was beyond creeped out. Was I being irrational? I did feel sorry for the dog, but if it could see fine and move fine, someone else can help it later. It sounded selfish, but the fear of rabies and this dog not behaving like a dog should was really freaking me out, more than I wanted to admit to myself at the time.

&#x200B;

My urge to relief myself was gone, so this is what scared -less meant. I decided to open the stall very fast and very wide so that it would block the view from the direction that I heard the dog came in. I sprinted out the other side of the bathroom.

&#x200B;

I got to my car, and got inside. After taking a deep breath, I felt foolish. It's the middle of the day. You can see 10-wheelers passing by at the entrance of the gas station, this is silly. And it was a dog with a mask stuck on its head, it wasn't going to bite. I even considered going back to take the mask off the dog. Just as I was finishing the thought, that dog blocked my path. Despite its moving forward to cut in front of me, the smiling tiger mask was turned to the side, directly facing me.

&#x200B;

I honked the horn.  It didn't budge. I honked again, and something I couldn't explain happened. As the dog turned its body to face me, the mask went in a reverse direction. No way the mask could change direction like that, could it?  The dog's body was now facing me, and so was the mask.

&#x200B;

Then, I saw the dog do a motion that I had never seen a dog does before. Its body remained still, but it extended its head forward, then snapped back in a jerking motion. Each time it jerked forward, its head seemed to extended out further than the last. After the third time, I felt like the dog's neck stretched out way too far and I had enough. I put my car in reverse and hightailed out of there.

&#x200B;

I didn't even exhale until I was on the road. I breathed out then looked to the side, and then I saw it.  The dog was running next to the car. I was going sixty, but it matched the car's speed. Its leg were impossibly long now. They were blurry because they were going so fast, but they looked more like tentacles than legs. And while it was running forward, the smiling tiger mask turned sideway again, looking straight at me.

&#x200B;

Then suddenly, a welcome sound is heard. A ten-wheeler blasted its horn from behind me. It sped up and passed me on the same side of the dog. It was going so fast, I could feel the wind it created slammed my car. After the ten-wheeler sped off, I looked to the side and could see that the dog was gone.

&#x200B;

I never appreciated the existence of ten-wheelers before in my life.
