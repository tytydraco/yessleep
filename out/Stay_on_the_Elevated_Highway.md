This story took place in South East Asia. I had to make a stop at a pretty rundown gas station at the edge of a city to buy some snack and go to the bathroom. Most people would go to the one well lit gas station that were strategically placed before the ramp to the elevated highways. The road under the highway belong the cement trucks, thick black smoke spewing 10-wheelers, and me.

&#x200B;

It was midday, and I stopped at this gas station before, and it was always quiet, but not this quiet.  No one was at the pump (like New Jersey, in this country you cannot pump your own gas), no one was at the convenience store. There were a few cars there but they could have been parked there for months. It was only me. My tank was still half full, so I just settle for using the restroom.

&#x200B;

Contrasting the eerie silence was a light banging sound that I heard only when I got out of the car. At first I thought it was a wind blowing on a rusted iron sheet. As I moved closer towards the convenience store , I saw what was causing the sound. **It was a dog with a bucket on its head.** It was ramming its head up against the iron sheet wall of an old shanty shack that housed the gas station's water pump.

&#x200B;

My first thought was, poor thing. The stray probably got its head stuck in a bucket while searching for food, or worse, some cruel person may have put a bucket on it as a prank.

&#x200B;

While hesitate for about a second, I immediately move in to get the bucket off of its head right away.  I hesitated because there were news reports of stray dogs with rabies in the area. I didn't want that fear to stop me from helping this poor dog, though.

&#x200B;

As I was walking towards it, the dog stopped ramming its head. It turned in my direction. I was pretty far from it, but it knew exactly which direction I was coming from.

&#x200B;

When I got a closer look,  I realized that it was not a bucket that was on its head. It was some sort of a latex mask, similar to those popular horse mask that people wears at sport events. But this one is a mask of a cartoon tiger. A poorly drawn cartoon tiger, as if it was drawn by a child, or someone who drew it from memory. The tiger's eyes curved upward, and it also had a wide grin. The smile didn't show fangs, but human teeth,  which somehow made it even more unsettling.

&#x200B;

I paused. As I slowed down my walking towards it, I started to change my mind about pulling the mask off of this dog. It didn't ram its head on the wall anymore. As I moved, it turned its head following my movement, meaning it could see just fine underneath the mask. Besides, it was a mask, not a bucket. May be it wasn't stray, but a dog that belong to the gas station owner. They will get the mask off of it when they got back, if they weren't the one putting the mask on it in the first place. But what I didn't like the most was that its tail was raised up high, but it was not wagging.

&#x200B;

I decided to change direction slightly and moved towards the bathroom. I was surprised by how clean it was. Well, as clean as a run-down gas station's bathroom that used water can be anyway.

&#x200B;

As I was about to do my business, I felt someone coming in the bathroom. And for once, I was relieved. Finally, another human being at this gas station. But then, something didn't feel right. The footsteps weren't heavy. It sounded like, small feet. Little feet tapping on wet floor tile. Four of them. It was the dog!

&#x200B;

The dog followed me into a bathroom? Why? Did it think I was going to help it pull off the mask or something? I was beyond creeped out. Was I being irrational? I did feel sorry for the dog, but if it could see fine and moved fine, someone else can help it later? It sounded selfish, but the fear of rabies and this dog not behaving like a dog should was really freaking me out, more than I wanted to admit to myself at the time.

&#x200B;

My urge to relief myself was gone, so this is what scared -less meant. I decided to open the stall very fast and very wide so that it would block the view of from the direction I heard the dog came in. I did not even look and quickly sprint out the other side of the bathroom. I know a dog is more likely to chase you if you run, but I didn't care.

&#x200B;

I got to my car, and got inside. After taking a deep breath, I felt foolish. It's the middle of the day. You can see cars passing by at the entrance of the gas station, this is silly. And it was a dog with a mask stuck on its head, it wasn't going to bite. Why do I have to psych myself up?  If it comes right down to it, I can just fight with this dog. It won't win, I will. That's what I told myself. Then as I was about to drive off, that dog blocked my path. Despite its moving forward cutting in front of me, the mask was turned to its side, directly facing me.

&#x200B;

I honked the horn again. This time something I couldn't explain happened. As the dog rearranged its body to face me, the mask looked like it was readjusted by an invisible hand. The movement of the dog's body couldn't have changed the direction of the mask like that. The dog was now facing me, and so was the mask.

&#x200B;

Then, I saw the dog do a motion that I had never seen a dog does before. Its body remained still. But it extended its head forward in a jerking motion. Each time it jerked back and forth, its head seemed to extended out further than the last. After the third time, I felt like the dog's neck stretched out way too far, and I had enough. I put my car in reverse and hightailed out of there.

&#x200B;

I didn't even exhale until I was on the road. I breathed out then looked to the side, and then I saw it.  The dog was running next to the car. I was going sixty, but it matched the car's speed. Its leg were impossibly long now. They were blurry because they were going fast, but look more like tentacles than legs. And while it was running forward, the smiling tiger mask turned sideway again, looking straight at me, inside the car.

&#x200B;

Then suddenly, a welcome sound is heard. A ten-wheeler blasted its horn from behind me. It sped up and passed me on the same side of the dog. It was going so fast, I could feel the wind shaking the car. After it drove off, I looked to the side and could see that the dog was gone.

&#x200B;

I have never appreciated existence of 10-wheelers before in my life.
