False God (Part 1 **third person explained in different part)**

The sin that cannot be forgiven  


“Are you paying attention, Anna?”  


The girl was jolted from her daze by her teacher’s voice. The other students' eyes pierced through the girl’s like daggers. Judging her, hating her, bullying her, but Anna did not care about any of their feelings. Anna did not care as long as she was loved by her God.  


“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I was praying, I’m very sorry.” Anna muttered, her cries for forgiveness barely audible to the teacher.  


“It’s okay Anna, just try to pay attention.” her teacher said, her voice turning soft and reassuring.  


Laughter could be heard throughout the classroom, but it did not bother Anna, she was glad to be here, to be in the perfect world her God had created for her.  


“I will.” Anna finally replied but her eyes weren’t on her teacher, neither was her mind, those things were never on anything but her God. Anna, staring past her teacher, clasped her hands tighter in prayer, praying as she stared at her God before her.  
  


“Anna, those kids dislike you,” her God’s voice entered Anna’s ears as she walked home.   


“I don’t mind, afterall, you created them too.” Anna replied cheerfully. Her God didn’t speak much yet they were always with her, floating near her with their long, pure, white wings. Even as the being floated, her God’s wings never moved, the beings mouth was constantly moving, chanting words that could not be heard and when the being spoke, it’s words did not match the movements of their mouth. The God had long white legs that were bent to touch the beings stomach. It’s entire body was pale and skinny, with long arms that ended in sharp claws. The being’s face was one that truly seemed devine and to Anna, the being could be defined as the word beauty itself.  


When they arrived home, Anna’s mother had already prepared her meal. Taking her seat at the table, Anna lifted her hands to pray….  


Anna’s mother couldn’t stand it, her daughter prayed and prayed, day after day, wasting her time on a forfeit being. She did not believe in God; afterall, if there was a God, her husband would not have died that day. This false deity was filling Anna with false hope, she had to let Anna know the truth of this cruel world, she had to let Anna know that there was no omnipotent being that could protect them and save them from their pitiful lives. She would tell Anna that her God was not real!       


Anna continued to pray, whispering her words softly and patiently. Each word savored on her tongue before being let out to reach her God. She loved her God, they had saved her, saved her from all her sufferings. Afterall, with God comes eternal peace.	  


Everytime she prayed, her God would glow brighter, as if absorbing her words of thanks. Praying was the least she could do for her God since they had always been there when she needed them the most. She would always pray, but no matter how much she prayed, no matter how much she did for her God, she would never be able to repay her debt, so she would continue.  


Anna noticed that her mother had already begun to eat without her prayers. She realised she never saw her mother pray and would often hear her mother scream curses at God. Why did she do this? Couldn’t she see just how beautiful God was? Anna could not understand. How could anyone not believe in God?  


“Mom, you have to pray,” Anna begged her as her hands clasped even tighter, tight enough to make her hands turn pale and fingers swell purple. “Pray with me mom, let’s pray together okay?” Anna would help her mother realize the mistakes in her actions, she would make her mother holy too. She had to pray, she had to thank God, otherwise who would protect her, who would forgive her of her sins?  


“Mom-” Anna muttered, but her mother only looked at the ground in anger.  


Anna’s mother could not stand this any longer. She knew Anna had felt guilt for what she had done, she knew why Anna created this false God, so she had to be the one to save her daughter from these lies, she had to tell Anna that her God was not real! “Can’t you see Anna, why won’t you wake up?” Her mother's words were harsh.  


“What do you mean, mom?” Anna’s hands were squeezing tighter and tighter together as disbelief flooded her face. Her eyes wandered to her God, desperately searching for the truth.  


“There is no God!” Her mother finally screamed at her.  


She was wrong, she was lying. There was a God, there had to be a God. Anna’s eyes darted around the room in disbelief until her gaze finally met her God, but something wasn’t right, her God was vanishing, flickering in and out of existence as if they may have never been there in the first place, as if they were only apart of the girl’s imagination  


“You’re wrong!” Anna screamed back, her hands only tightening more in prayer, forming black rings around her fingers from the pressure, “You have to be wrong! If my God isn’t real, if they truly are fake, then what the hell have I been doing all this time!”  


There was a God, there had to be a God, otherwise who would protect her, who would save her from sins, who would grant her peace? Her mother was wrong, her mother had to be wrong. Ann’s God was here, her God was with Anna since her father had died, her God was the only being that could forgive her! Tears began to stream down Anna’s face, tears filled with grief, her God must have been disappointed in her for letting her belief falter, she had not been a good servant.  


“I’m sorry, God.” Anna whispered, “I will never disbelieve in you again.”   


Her God only watched her, their flickering finally stopped as Anna regained her belief. They would not let her mind sway again, they had to protect her belief or they would cease to exist. They needed each other, Anna and her God. Her God needed Anna so they could remain in this world, and Anna needed her God to forgive her for her sins and provide her hope, even if it was false. Nothing would ever separate them again.  


Anna’s mother felt pity for her daughter, her daughter who created a fake God for her own reassurance. Anna believed that by creating this God, that by having someone to beg to for forgiveness, that her sins of that day could be forgotten, but they would never be forgotten and would live with her forever as a reminder of why her father died. Anna’s mother couldn’t allow Anna to fill her soul with lies, she had to save her, she had to do something, but she did not know what to do.  


When night had finally arrived, Anna had already begun her nighttime prayers. Kneeling beside her bed, her hands clasped shut, she began to pray. Praying for minutes, for hours, until                                                                                                                                                                                                    her hands and knees were red. She didn’t notice her God leaving her for a small time, and she didn’t notice her God entering her mother’s room, her mind and thoughts were focussed only on her prayer.  


Her God had to silence Anna’s mother, if she continued to make Anna unfaithful, if she continued to get in their way, then they would soon disappear. Slowly, their left wing moved, lifting the woman’s head to reveal her neck. No, they would not kill her yet, as that would sadden Anna, they would only silence her. The God’s wing moved up to the woman’s mouth, before swiftly slicing it open and removing her tongue. They would not kill her, as it would not please Anna, however her mother had no reason to speak any longer. Anna’s God covered the woman’s screams before putting her back to sleep and stopping the blood. Now no one would get in their way.  


Anna's mother couldn’t speak anymore, the only sound she could omit was a low mumble, but it didn’t bother Anna since now her mother couldn’t fill her head with lies. The girl’s God was shining even brighter than ever and seemed much more powerful. Anna would continue to pray to her God, praying until her last breaths, maybe one day the girl would finally be forgiven for her father’s death.  


It was three years ago, when Anna and her father were driving home from school. Anna was younger then, more foolish then, but those excuses could not forgive her for what she had done. She had begged her father to let her sit in the front seat, even though she was not the right age to, but after whining, her father allowed her the seat. Anna did not know that these doors were not child proof, she did not know that these doors could be opened while they were driving, so as they headed on the freeway, minutes away from home, Anna’s hand slowly pulled the car door’s handle.  


It was such a beautiful day, that day, a beautiful day that became the darkest day of her life. Anna’s door flung open as she screamed and struggled to hold on to the car door, her body nearly scraping the road below her. In the panic her father’s foot stepped on the petal even harder as he struggled to pull Anna back into the car. He was not worried for anyone’s safety except for his daughter’s. Her father would not let her go, his strong grip pulled Anna’s dangling body back to her seat as he slammed the door shut.  


“That was close,” her father chuckled, staring at Anna with his gentle and forgiving face, but Anna was not staring at him, she was staring at the road ahead of them, the road that they had begun to drift off from.  


“Dad!” Anna screamed but it was already too late, they had crashed into a tree at 80 mph. Anna could remember the look on her father’s face well, the kindness turning to complete terror in a fraction of a second, all because of her foolish mistake. She remembered the blood all over his body as they hit the tree and remembered how she did not even get a scratch. It was at that crash that her God had first appeared and protected her, causing her to not be harmed, but why hadn’t her God protected her father instead?  


Anna’s hands clasped tighter and tighter. Why was she remembering this now? Why were these memories still torturing her soul? She began to pray even more and more, trying to distract her thoughts from those fateful events. She looked at her God, staring at the perfect being allowed all of her emotions of sadness and distress to instantly fade away.  
  
They were following her after school, some of the children from her class. Walking slowly behind her, watching her, snickering at her, but Anna couldn’t understand why. She had never done anything wrong to them, she had never bothered them, so why did they all hate her? Slowly, Anna raised her hands to begin another prayer. Praying for these children to leave her alone, praying for their safety, and finally praying for her forgiveness. Anna did not even notice the other children slowly getting closer to her, slowly approaching her until they were close enough to grab her, so she was shocked when she felt someone grab her wrist and gasped at the sudden touch.  
“Hey, Anna,” one of the boys chuckled as his grip on her wrist tightened, “Who are you praying to?”  


Anna’s eyes widened. What did they want, why couldn’t they just leave me alone? She only wanted to pray. “To my God,” Anna finally muttered.  


The kids laughed at her, “What good will that do?” one said.  


Anna didn’t understand what he meant. Praying will save you, it will forgive you, why could they not understand that?  


“Why are you praying, Anna,” he repeated.  


All of their eyes were staring at her, filled with anger, filled with rage, they all needed to be saved.  


“I pray to be forgiven,” Anna spoke, “I pray to be loved, and most of all I pray to be saved-”  


The other children burst out in laughter, mocking her words.  


“Who would ever love you?”  


“To be forgiven for what?”  


And finally, “Who’s going to save you now?”  


Their taunts only made Anna’s hands tighten in prayer. Anna tried to ignore their snickers, tried to keep their words out of her thoughts, but they tormented her. Why would her God forgive her? Why did her God love her? Would her God even save her! She did not deserve any of those things. The girl’s belief was beginning to falter, her soul tormented by their words. What God would love a sinner like her?  


Her God had to do something, those children were making Anna’s belief sway, the being could feel their power being drained, they could feel Anna’s uncertainty grow. “Close your eyes, Anna.” her God spoke and Anna instantly obeyed. She kept her eyes closed, even when she heard the kids' screams, she kept them closed even when she heard the cracking of bones. The girl would never open her eyes until her God told her to do so, and as her eyes were closed, Anna continued to pray, to strengthen her God, to let her God know that she would always believe in them.  


“You may open them,” her God finally said and Anna opened her eyes to reveal her at home, being carried by her God’s soft wings. They felt so warm yet powerful.  


Slowly Anna looked up at her God, “I love you.” Anna whispered and her God only glowed brighter.  


Anna’s mother was waiting for her inside. She had to end this now, she had to stop Anna from believing in this false God. It would only hurt Anna as it had hurt her. She knew it was that false God that had made her unable to speak, it had silenced her to stop her from protecting her daughter. The being was no God, it was a demon!  


Slowly, Anna walked into her house and she walked inside with her God at her side. Anna’s mother could see it now, she could see the false God that had deceived her daughter for so long. It’s long, pitch black wings and body, it’s red eyes that glowed too bright to stare at. The being was a demon and she had to stop it!   


Anna’s mother reached her hand out to Anna, trying to lead her away from the being, but Anna did not reach back, she only looked at her mother in disgust.  


“We don’t need you anymore,” Anna whispered, her wide eyes stabbing through her mother’s chest, hurting the woman’s soul, “goodbye, mom.”  


Her mother’s words were only mumbles that escaped her body. Her cries to save her daughter were inaudible as she struggled to speak to Anna, to show her that her God was no God at all. The demon began to glide towards Anna’s mother and she backed away in fear. The being cut through her eyes swiftly with their sharp wings.  


Anna’s mother cried in pain, her hands covering her eyes as blood poured from them. However she could not give up, she had to save her daughter, even if it cost her life. Slowly, she began to crawl toward Anna, her hands stretched out, reaching for her. Even though she could not speak, her words still vaguely formed her daughter’s name. “Anna.” she whispered as she finally felt her daughter’s touch. Her mother felt happy, even if she would die like this, betrayed by her own daughter, she was happy to feel Anna’s touch one final time. Feeling the warmth of the daughter she couldn’t protect.  


“Sorry, Anna.”  


Anna shoved her own mother off of her and watched as her God swiftly beheaded her. “Goodbye, mom,” Anna said again, but this time tears were streaming down her face. Anna could not understand why she was crying, she had done what she was meant to do, so why did this sadden her? It was her mother’s own fault, she had to die for her disbelief, so why did Anna feel bad, why did Anna feel as if a piece of her was missing? Hadn't she done the right thing, wasn’t this what she was supposed to do? Anna believed what she did could not have been wrong and she decided she would continue to get rid of those who got in her way with no remorse. Anna looked back at her mother one last time before leaving the house with her God, her hands tightening in prayer as they left.  


Her God was glowing even brighter.
