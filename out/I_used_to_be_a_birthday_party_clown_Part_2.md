I wasn’t gonna post this. I really wasn’t. But then yesterday I got a package on my doorstep.

Inside: a red foam clown nose.

No return address. Just a sticky note that said, in all caps:

"YOU LEFT WITHOUT LAUGHING."

So yeah. Guess who’s screaming into the internet again?

Buckle up, honk-honkers. We’re going back in.

After the Shed Incident, I tried to go back to normal life. I applied for boring jobs. Real ones. Like office assistant, parking lot attendant, dog food taste tester. Anything that didn’t involve greasepaint or staring into the abyss while a 6-year-old speaks in tongues.

The problem was, everywhere I went, people stared at me. Not like “hey, you’ve got a fun face,” but like I was rotting.
One time, I was at a Subway (the sandwich place, not the train) and the lady behind the counter—swear to God—looked up from my footlong (the sandwich, ya pervert) blinked twice, and said:

“You still got the makeup on, clown.”

Me: “first off, I’m not even wearing any makeup.”
Her (dead serious): “Then why are your eyes bleeding?”

I ran to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.

Nothing. 
Normal face. 
Tired eyes. 
No blood. 
No paint.

Yet people kept seeing things.

At night, I’d hear faint giggles in the walls.
Then the honking started. Not like car honking. Nose honking.

Sometimes, just before I fell asleep, I’d hear static.

Like the Scream Clown. Like he was tuning into my brain like I was a haunted AM radio.

So obviously I did the logical thing.

I started drinking heavily.

Fast forward to last week. My buddy Greg (shoutout Greg, professional escape room designer and full-time chaos goblin) calls me.

Greg: “Dude, got a gig for you. Easy money. I need a clown for a haunted carnival themed escape room. You in?”
Me: “Absolutely the hell not.”
Greg: “Fifty bucks an hour.”
Me: “What time should I be there and do you want me to bring my own corpse paint?”

I know, I know. I'm an idiot but rent was due. Again. Plus, Greg promised, “You just sit in a chair and cackle once in a while. No kids, no birthdays, no weird cult stuff.”

Spoiler: there was so much weird cult stuff.

The “escape room” was actually in this warehouse out by the train tracks. Very Murdercore aesthetic. Big red banner at the entrance that said:

“LAUGH TO ESCAPE.”

Cute, right?
Until I realized that the “props” looked a little too... real.
Like, the cotton candy machine was full of hair.
And the funhouse mirrors? Didn’t reflect me.

I was like, “Greg, bro, what the actual hell?”
Greg (nervous laugh): “It’s just... immersive design! You know! 4D horror realism!”
Me: “This mirror is showing me with my jaw unhinged and eyes rolled back like I just got possessed by the ghost of Robin Williams. THIS IS NOT OSHA-COMPLIANT!”

He shrugs. Hands me a striped jumpsuit and rainbow wig.
Greg: “C’mon, one night. It’ll be fun.”

Famous last words.

Cut to midnight.

I’m sitting in the “clown chamber" which is literally a ring of circus lights flickering like they’re powered by screams and regret. The room smells like old popcorn and gasoline.

Greg’s in the control booth, feeding in a group of escape room players. Teens. The TikTok kind. One of them’s already filming. Naturally.

I’m supposed to jump scare them halfway through their puzzle. Easy.

Except... when they enter the room, they freeze.

Teen Girl: “Who’s... that?”

I assume they mean me.

Problem is, I’m in the shadows.

Then I hear the giggle.

Not mine.

Not theirs.

Then across the room, I see what they're staring at.

The Fucking Scream Clown.

Same creepy ass melting face. Same weird ass crooked smile. Same eyes like bottomless carnival rides to hell.

Only now, he’s holding a balloon with my fucking face on it!

Me (internal monologue): “I should’ve worked at that stupid factory forever.”

He doesn’t speak. 

He doesn’t move. 

He just tilts his head.

Every light in the warehouse then flickers off.

Darkness.

Then the creepiest shit I've ever heard, which at this point is saying something:

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOONNNNK.

Like a clown nose possessed by Satan’s kazoo.

The teens scream. I scream. You would've screamed too if you were there. Greg yells “cut the lights!” from the booth.

Lights go back to normal. 

The teens are gone.

The balloon is still there only now it has Greg's face in it. 

I ran. Full sprint. Wig flew off mid-jump over the cotton candy hair pile.

I didn’t stop until I got to my car and peeled out of there like a clown being chased by every regret of his adult life.

This morning, I woke up to this carved into my bedroom wall:

“YOU LAUGHED. YOU STAY.”

I think he’s getting closer.

I keep seeing balloons in my backyard.

I don’t even have trees.

Last night I heard a knock on my window.

I live on the third floor.

So yeah.

I was a birthday party clown.

Now I’m just a guy waiting for a punchline that might be me.
