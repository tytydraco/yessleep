When I got the news, I felt like it was the best day of my life. I had been trying to break into the industry for years, so when I got the job I spontaneously burst into tears.

However, things haven't gone exactly as I expected since I arrived. My co-workers all seem nice, and even my manager is a pretty friendly guy. During our first full team meeting though, something weird happened. 

As my manager was going over our monthly calendar, I felt something brush past my leg, almost like fingers gently brushing against my shoe up to my ankle. I let out a little squeal of fright and pushed away from the table. My manager stopped mid-sentence to ask me if I was okay. Everyone was looking at me, obviously worried and a little surprised by the outburst.

I told them the truth, that I felt something brush past my leg. I looked under the table, thinking maybe that my co-worker sitting across from me (a friendly, balding IT guy) may have stretched his legs and unintentionally brushed up against my foot.

But I quickly realized that would have been impossible, because there was no space under the the conference table. Instead, there was a solid, mirrored cube supporting the table. No legs, no space, just a solid mirror.

My manager suggested it might have been a bug and continued with the meeting, but I was completely distracted for the rest of the day. It definitely wasn't a bug, it just felt too big to be a bug. 

A week later, we had another team meeting. Just a few minutes into my managers presentation, it happened again. This time it felt like someone wrapped their hand around the top of my foot.

Unlike the first time, I completely froze. At first it was a pure panic reaction, but after a few seconds I remember making the choice to not freak out. I didn't want my coworkers to think I was crazy just a week into the job I've been dreaming of for years.

The feeling didn't go away, so I slowly tried to peak under the table without calling any attention to myself. Just before I could see anything, the hand let go. My manager called on me in that moment and asked if I was okay. I guess I wasn't as subtle as I'd hoped, but I told him everything was fine.

I stayed late after work that day just to take a closer look at the table. This might sound nuts, but I thought maybe I'd find some kind of trap door or hidden hatch built into the table. I was crawling around on my hands and knees, determined to find some kind of hint as to what I experienced, but there were no seams or anything. 

I knocked on it, and it did sound a little hollow, but the cleaning lady came in just as I was wrapping my knuckles. She gave me a good scare honestly, and I think I might have freaked her out a bit as well. I was super embarrassed and told her I was just looking for my pen. I rushed out of there, but I could feel that my face was bright red with embarrassment.

Tomorrow I have another team meeting and I'm honestly not sure what to do. Has anything like this ever [happened to you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/xXxPlanetVegaxXx/s/embfcfraYB)
