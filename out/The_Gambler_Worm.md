I knew him before he got his nickname. I knew him before he was a story.

Adeel and me went to high-school together and we both dropped out at around the same time for the same reasons. Both of us got a job with a local businessman. The prospects from this job were considerably better than finishing off our schooling.

We’d drive goods from town to town. Or, more accurately, I’d drive and Adeel would keep a look-out for the authorities or any other competing merchants. It’s on one of these drives that Adeel would earn the nickname he would be called until the end of time:

*The Gambler Worm*.

Adeel wasn’t a big guy, but he carried himself as if he was. Back in high-school Adeel would never shy away from instigating a fight. He would shout and puff out his chest and threaten to knock out teeth. By the time the music started and everyone joined in on the dance, however, Adeel would disappear.

He had a big mouth. He was quick to seize an opportunity. The man dealt in buckets of bluffs with no plan B. His temper would ultimately undo him, but that one night, so many years ago, it saved both of our asses.

We were moving some untaxed cigarettes across the country. We had been stopped earlier that night, but Adeel was asleep. Luckily, the guard who wanted words was no saint. After a brief conversation and a couple slipped bills, our unwelcome visitor became uninterested in the contents of the truck. I didn’t have to even wake Adeel up.

The second time we got stopped was different.

The car rode up in front of its with its lights flashing and its sirens blaring. No room for negotiation. No common courtesy. When the guy walked up to the truck, he had his hand resting on his pistol. No chitchat. He wanted to see our documents and what we were transporting.

Neither of us were armed. Guns complicate things and getting into a firefight over some cigarettes wasn’t worth the injury. With the bedside manner of the cop, I was pretty certain me and Adeel were going to get cuffed.

It wasn’t optimal, but it wasn’t the end of the world. We’d sit for a bit. Six months at worst, probably less. We’d sit for a bit but if we kept quiet and dumb, we would get our back wages and a nifty bonus from the boss by the time we got out.

I didn’t see any other choice than to cooperate with the patrol. Adeel, however, was always vigilant for the faintest show of opportunity. When asked for his identification, Adeel didn’t cooperate. Instead, he got out of the car and walked over to the lone patrolman.

By the time Adeel was half way around the truck, the cop had his gun unholstered. This did not bother my colleague a single bit. Ignoring the orders to get back in the vehicle, Adeel strolled over to the cop.

He spoke gently, and in a friendly manner, but chosen words were sharpened by a sudden monotone. Adeel bid the patrolman a pleasant evening and then criticized him for his demeanor. To simply run up to a stranger and demand documents without pleasantries would be offensive in the city. It could be *deadly* out here in the *steppe*.

Even though there was gun pointed at him, Adeel put his arm around the patrolman’s shoulder and gestured out at the vast swathe of emptiness beyond. In the darkness there was nothing but a sea of grass. Off in the distance, eaten up by the night, there were suggestions of hills. Aside from our high-beams and the patrol car’s flashing lights, the world beyond existed as mere suggestion.

We were *alone* on the road, Adeel told the patrolman. Perhaps, he could be a good citizen who’s used to being treated without respect. Or, perhaps, he could be someone who would *take high offense to the intrusion*. Out here in the *steppe*, *in the dark*, it could be hard to tell.

Watching Adeel work at the patrolman was nauseating. I was terrified the hothead would try to wrestle away at the cop’s gun and set us down the short road to prison. He spoke slowly, and deliberately, and I spent the entire monologue eyeing the gas pedal.

Yet, instead of attempting to kill the man, Adeel extended his hand to him. To my utter shock, the patrolman holstered his gun.

The two shook hands.

Adeel told the patrolman, with a smile, that he didn’t want to have any other interactions with the authorities for the night. As a goodbye, he jingled his cell phone at the cop.

Our guys had a faster response time, Adeel said.

We were just two kids with a vague connection to organized crime and a truck full of stolen cigarettes, but Adeel had the patrolman believing he was lucky to have walked away alive. We could have long been behind bars, or worse, but we weren’t.

That night, Adeel’s gamble paid off.

Over the years, stories of similar odds would play out in front of the other guys. Combined with his appetite for dice and poker, Adeel earned himself the first part of his nickname: *The Gambler.*

People liked him because he was bold and would never let an opportunity slip. What they didn’t know Adeel was just lucky. Adeel was just impulsive and lucky and one day that luck would run out.

Last year, the businessman we work for gets a tip about an untapped new customer. His bald driver shows up to work with a head full of hair. Apparently, there’s some magical hair cream operation being run out of a warehouse in the sticks. The purveyor of the business wasn’t yet acquainted with my boss. We were called in as muscle along with a couple other guys.

There were two identical shaved Neanderthals guarding the warehouse with rifles, but they put up no resistance. I don’t know what they were riding on, but they just stared off into the distance as we made our way in.

The warehouse was a packing operation. A couple dozen folks were wrapping up jars of pink sludge with colorful wrapping that read ‘HAPPY HAIR’. While our boss interviewed the owner, we examined the stocks and took samples.

We had seen the boss’s driver. We knew the cream was the real deal.

Our boss calls Adeel and me over to the office. The head of the magic cream operation seems to be a scientist type with a lazy eye and a mop of black hair. Apparently, he doesn’t understand the power dynamic playing out in the office. He doesn’t want to talk to the boss. He treats us all like we’re some street trash that has stumbled into his place of business.

Adeel and me set out to convince him that we are to be taken seriously. By the time we break his third finger, he becomes a lot more talkative. The scientist says he works for a research facility. Selling the magical hair cream is simply a means of raising funds for important research. There’s no space in the finances for kickbacks.

When we work away at his fourth finger, the scientist admits that yes, maybe, there is some room in the budget for local tribute. Our boss seems pleased; both with our work and with the resolution to the business discussion. He almost seems content to end discussions, yet before we leave— he asks one more question:

Our boss asks the scientist for the name of the scientific organization he represents.

The scientist answers without any reluctance: He works for the Ғылыми қондырғы.

The boss tells us to let him go. I would have done so even if I wasn’t ordered.

The Ғылыми қондырғы has long been a subject of local whispers. Back in the day, it was called The United People’s Institute of Science. Its reputation was far from positive, but it was still said to operate within some understandable, human framework. When the Soviets collapsed, the institute shuttered its doors as well.

Something else was born in its place. Something incomprehensible.

We left the warehouse immediately. The boss forced all the guys to return the samples of hair cream they had appropriated. No business was to be done there. Whatever the people of the Institute had going on was their own concern.

We had all heard stories of the Ғылыми қондырғы. Of incomprehensible science, of monsters beyond belief, of tainted water which would dissolve all living things into worms. We had all heard stories and most of the guys were content to stay away from the institute.

Adeel, however, had different plans.

About a week later, he came to me and informed me that he and a couple of his associates had decided to go into business with Dr. Barat, the scientist who’s hand we had mangled. It wasn’t a protection racket per se, sure, some of the money was ear-marked to keep the rest of the scientist’s digits intact, but Adeel was also kind enough to help Dr. Barat sell his product to a larger audience.

He had transportation contacts. He had marketing contacts. The hair cream was, indeed, magic. It would be a shame to not make some scratch off of it.

I, of course, wholeheartedly rejected the offer. Many of the stories told about the Institute and the dark science practiced within it were undoubtedly made up, but even if a fraction of those stories were true — I had no interest in risking my life and soul.

I rejected Adeel’s offer and suggested to him that he abandon his pursuits as well. Nothing good ever came of getting involved with the Ғылыми қондырғы. This was one gamble he was better off not making.

Yet Adeel, the gambler, wasn’t one to shy away from a payday. With some disappointment, he told me he respected my decision. Once the money started rolling in, he said, he would buy me a drink.

Adeel would end up buying me that drink, yet it would not be a celebratory one.

For a couple months I did not see him. I had a fair amount of business to attend to myself and Adeel was too busy managing the export of the hair cream. When we finally met for that promised drink, Adeel’s new suit and jewelry sang a tale of wealthy. His harrowed face, however, suggested things might have gone astray.

Initially, the business was doing good, Adeel said. The cream was, indeed, magic. Within days it could make a bald man sprout a head of hair that would make Samson jealous. The cream came ready made from the Institute in little jars labeled GH058. All Adeel and his people had to do was package it and market it.

For months, the business was going swell. Dr. Barat was a gloomy character, but he understood his position within the local food chain and made no effort to change it. Regular customers were established, new markets were tapped and Adeel’s purse grew with each shipment.

As smoothly as Adeel’s business was going, however, Dr. Barat and the Institute were in need of additional support. About a month ago, the scientist introduced Adeel to his new business partner. Professor Henry Willow, an American scientist.

Strange fellow. Stranger than Dr. Barat.

Apparently, this grown man carried around with him a schoolyard notebook covered in Pokémon stickers. He seemed unenthused about Adeel’s part in the business and barely spoke to him. Professor Willow seemed to find the lucrative hair cream trade to be a waste of time. He had other plans for the Institute and those plans did not include selling cosmetic products.

Professor Willow only showed up to the warehouse once. Dr. Barat showed up daily, as he always did, for about two weeks. Then, he too, stopped coming around. Along with Dr. Barat, the shipments of the hair cream stopped as well.

Adeel sent some guys to figure out what had happened to Dr. Barat and to the magical cream, yet they never came back. Adeel had plenty of orders to fill and only half the hair cream he needed to fill them. Left without any answers and a ticking clock, Adeel decided to take another gamble.

He watered down the hair cream.

When he told me he managed to fulfill all the orders with only half the product, I thought myself privy to another tale of Adeel’s luck. Yet when Adeel told me where he had gotten the water to cut his product with, I understood his harrowed face.

The United People’s Institute of Science was an underground research facility. When it had transformed into the Ғылыми қондырғы it continued to operate underground yet it needed additional security measures.

In 2003, there was an attempted raid on the Institute by governmental forces. In order to fend off the raid and ensure the safety of the facility, the Ғылыми қондырғы utilized some of its forbidden science. Around the cement shack that served as the entry into the institute, a moat of foul water was created.

This water, rumor said, would turn all that touched it to worms.

Adeel didn’t believe any of the stories about the Institute, and he had creditors chomping at his heels. With the moat being the closest unguarded source of water, he used it.

The shipments left the warehouse without incident, but it didn’t take long for Adeel’s phone to be assaulted by furious calls. There was something wrong with the cream. There was something terribly, terribly wrong with the cream.

Among the calls Adeel had received was one from a local number. Our boss had heard about Adeel’s new business venture. He was not happy. Apparently, he had received a call from a certain Professor Willow who was not happy either.

Our boss wanted to meet Adeel and some of the other members of the defunct hair cream operation. He wanted to meet them right by the entrance to the Ғылыми қондырғы.

He wanted to meet them right by the moat.

I tried to convince Adeel to run. I tried to make him understand that he had made a terrible mistake and that his luck had run out. If he were to go to the meeting, I told him, he would not come back alive.

Adeel listened. His face was sunken and tired and I guess he, on some level, knew I was right. Yet, when I finished talking, Adeel simply swallowed his drink and told me he would give his next steps some thought.

I told him to call me once he came to a decision.

He never did.

Instead, two days later, I received a call from our boss.

We were loaded in a car and driven well outside of the city. It was dark. No one in the car dared to speak a word, but I could recognize most of the passengers. Everyone was a part of the initial crew that went to the warehouse back when the hair cream business seemed like a lucrative untapped opportunity.

When the cars stopped, we were walked through the forest in the companion of tall men wearing riot gear armed with rifles. Even in the darkness cut with nothing but a dozen weak flashlights I could see the foliage around us growing sickly. When all the dying grass and bushes gave way to a clearing of dead earth, I knew exactly where we were being taken.

We were being taken to the Ғылыми қондырғы.

In the center of the clearing sat a cement shack. Around that cement shack stretched a round moat of shimmering water. Adeel and some of the guys who worked for him were tied up and sitting on the edge of the moat. A tall bald man in a lab coat who I presumed to be Professor Willow stood by and jotted down notes in his Pokémon notebook.

As our boss spoke, Adeel tried to cut in. The gambler tried to talk his way out of the bad odds as he always did, but Adeel’s words were quickly quieted with a stern slap.

He had warned us not to get involved with the Institute, our boss said. He had warned us and most of us had listened.

But not all.

Among the tied-up men at the edge of the moat was some guy who claimed to not be a part of the mob. He said he was just a resort owner who came upon some hard financial times. He didn’t know what he was doing was forbidden or illegal. He said he had learned his lesson. He begged to be let go.

He was the first one to be dropped into the moat.

When I heard the gurgling screams from the darkness, I wanted to avert my eyes. The boss, however, insisted that we see what happens when one communes with forces best left alone. He insisted we watch.

One by one, Adeel’s associates were dropped into the moat of rancid water. One by one they screamed, struggled and finally went limp. One by one, their bodies dissolved in writhing, pale masses of flesh.

Adeel went last. He begged for mercy yet his tone of voice made it clear he knew he would be afforded none. He screamed just like the rest of them. He went limp just like the rest of them. He disappeared just like the rest of them.

Adeel was a lucky man, but one day his luck ran [out](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/q2qjz1/%D2%93%D1%8B%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%BC%D0%B8_%D2%9B%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B%D1%80%D2%93%D1%8B/).
