Our wedding group celebrated with an after-party at an Italian restaurant. Train tracks above the eatery caused the noise of the industrial wheels to thunder. The clattering could not even be muffled by the overhead violin music and thick walls.

Anita and I were bridesmaids for the woman of the hour, our mutual close friend Kate. Kate had decided to swear a lifetime of commitment to a Professor of film studies at a university only a few miles outside the town two years beforehand in July. Although he was a decade older than her and his initial motives were naturally questioned by her family, he was in love with everything about Kate. 

The ceremony had been a peaceful one with a lakefront view. 

The hundred of us were seated and awaited our food. The main foyer of the place became a dance floor as a private bar opened up in the corner near a window that overlooked a graveyard across the street.

“When are you going to find your soulmate?” Anita asked as she leaned into me while we watched the newlyweds cut their cake and hand-feed it to each other.

“Oh please,” I said with an eye roll.

“What? You don’t think it’s possible for you? Look at Kate. She swore off any attempt at romance after her first boyfriend in College went to that country club prison for embezzlement at his hedge fund. Cupid doesn’t care about your perspective. He drunkenly shoots all the time and you never know when one of his stray arrows will hit you in the heart.”

“That’s the corniest thing I’ve ever heard anyone say.”

“It’s true though. You deserve a man who will treat you the way you deserve.”

“Please drop it,” I said as I lifted a glass of red wine and took a long pull. “After my last ex I’m going to take a break from the nonsense of dating. He made me reconsider how much I trust my taste in men. No, I’m about to become a manager and that’s going to take a lot of energy. My career is first and foremost right now.”

“The director of marketing at my company is named Chris,” Anita said with a smile. “He’s thirty so he’s only a few years older than you. He makes a hundred thousand a year and keeps fit. I trust my intuition and it tells me you and him would get along great. I could give you his phone number if you’d like.”

“Anita,” I said with an aggressive whisper as there was a brief interlude between songs, “stop it. You won’t convince me.”

Kate leaned back in her chair and nodded as the waiter set our plates down. 

Once dinner was finished I looked at my timepiece. Nightfall was near.

I congratulated Kate and said goodbye to both her and the groom.

I fished my keys out of my purse and walked into the parking lot. A few others trickled out into the evening air and departed for the highway. 

I neared my Hyundai and used my fob to unlock it. 

A group of four men surrounded my vehicle. 

They all wore casual T-shirts and cargo shorts. Two of them held expensive-looking cameras. A short one with a charcoal black mustache held a boom and had earmuff-style headphones on. 

One of the cameramen was filming the interior of my vehicle. 

This gave me chills. I was speechless and tried to figure out why they would focus on the interior of my mode of transportation. Could a wild animal have gotten inside somehow and they were trying to capture the moment for their social media? 

Of course this made no sense. Getting such footage wouldn’t have required a full-fledged hired crew.

“What are you doing?” I asked with a forceful tone.

They all shifted their attention towards me. None of them even mouthed a single word in response. The tallest man took a few steps in my direction as he raised his camera and pointed it at me.

A lump formed in the back of my throat. I had the urge to scream but could not raise my voice which had somehow been lost since the sight of them.

The recordist tapped the cameraman on the shoulder and pointed to the road. 

The individual who I sensed wanted to get nearer to me turned around and directed the rest of the group to move away. 

They jumped into a silver van with a creaky sliding door. 

They drove away and left a trail of dust as they exited the lot.

I searched around for surveillance cameras. 

There were none. Any potential witnesses had exited the vicinity or were nowhere in sight. 

I wanted to cry. As I stood there in between a street light and a section of vacant yellow-lined parking spaces I could not understand who they were or what they wanted.

Could the men have been private investigators? I had not committed any crimes outside of a speeding ticket from two years before. Them having been undercover was a ridiculous notion for something so minor but my mind did race with possibilities. 

Paparazzi? 

I was not famous. 

I was not even related to or friends with someone who was.

I neared the car and maintained an arm's length distance from it as I did a full circle. I stared at the front and back seats. 

Nothing was unusual nor was anything taken. 

Perhaps they were an independent production shooting a low-budget movie. That kind of artistic activity was not uncommon in this area of Southern California.

I calmed myself with some deep breaths, hopped onto the driver's side and drove back home. 

I would try and forget the strange occurrence. 

Maybe you overreacted by assuming they had ill intent, I told myself.

A week went by and Anita invited me to play tennis with her. 

The court we met at was located in between a public library and a fire station. 

Our bleach-white tank tops and skirts shone brightly under the sun’s glare. I both loved and hated the game for how difficult it could be on a humid day. The rigorous exercise provided an outlet for escape and helped me temporarily forget about stress.

“Let’s make a bet,” Anita said as she threw the ball in the air and caught it with the grace of a juggler. “If I win you have to let me give you a psychic reading about your personal life. I get to describe to you who you might meet in the next eighteen months using my intuition. If you win then I buy you an expensive dinner at a seaside place in Malibu.”

“I respect your beliefs,” I said, “but I told you I don’t want anything to do with witchcraft.”

“It’s non-localized consciousness that anyone can hone with the right meditative techniques,” she said with a smirk, as though she had memorized the sentence from a spiritual lecture.

It may have been the decent sleep within the prior twenty-four hours or the energy boost from that morning’s very strong espresso, but I said yes and agreed to the bet. 

I served. 

I hit the ball far enough to make her run after it. Her racket connected with the ball and sent it my way. 

Our match became competitive in a way that none of our previous games in eight years of knowing each other ever had. We kept the game going to where I predicted a tiebreak was inevitable.

Someone appeared in my periphery.

I turned to my left to get a better glance at the stranger and failed to return the shot. 

I lost the game. 

The defeat was the least of my concerns.

The same film crew I had seen seven days ago stood there behind the chain link fence that divided us. 

The one with the boom smiled at me as a blood-red liquid dripped from the end of the microphone onto the hot pavement. A small stream of crimson flowed near his shoes.

“I’ll use the drinking fountain in the library and we can have five more sets,” Anita said as she jogged towards the front of the building after she whipped a towel over her shoulder. 

I motioned her to stop and stay with me but she had already turned her back. I could not find my voice. 

I ran towards the access way and circled the court to get to the film crew.

I reached into my gym bag at the edge of the court and retrieved a canister of mace I always tried to have at hand.

I was already a bit slower than I would have liked from the intensive cardio used before as I sprinted at them.

While I approached one of them laughed and moved down the road towards that same silver van. It was parked in the shade of a valley oak tree. They hopped in with the same speed as a professional militia retreating from an assassination mission and accelerated up a nearby hill. 

They were out of sight. 

I gasped for air and went back onto the court.

Anita walked towards me with a concerned look on her face and she could tell something was wrong.

“Did you see them?” I asked.

“Who?”

I described each creep down to the brand of footwear they had on and she shook her head. 

“I’m calling the cops,” I said. 

A patrolman showed up less than a half-hour later. He was no older than twenty-two and looked as though he was new to the force. His name tag read ‘Jones.’

One thing about the Officer’s appearance caught me off guard. He had the same phony-looking charcoal mustache as the crew member who had been following me.

“Can you turn your body camera off?” I asked. “I’m sick of people filming me against my will this week.”

“Sorry ma’am,” he said as he pulled out a notepad and pen. “No can do. It’s on for your safety and mine.”

“Okay. There’s a group of men stalking me.”

“Can you give me their descriptions?”

I did to the best of my recollection and gave him the color and model of their getaway car.

“Did you get a license plate number? Were there any identifiable bumper stickers or logos?”

“No. I’m afraid not.”

“Did they say anything to you?”

“No. They taunted me though.”

“How?”

“They smiled at me.”

“Okay. Have you met or known any of these individuals beforehand? Ex-boyfriends maybe, or guys who asked you out on dates that you may have rejected in the past?”

“No,” I said. A swelling of resentment formed in my chest. I did not like that he was trying to paint a picture in his report of me attracting bad company, as though it would have been my fault even if I had known those probable lunatics. There was a tinge of potential victim blaming that made me nauseous and angry.

I had already been with a guy who mistreated me almost a year beforehand, and a part of me wondered if this Officer knew about the case. He had probably already ran my name after collecting my ID at the beginning of the field interview.

“What kind of investigation can you do to help get these guys away from me? One had a microphone soaked in blood.”

“Did you witness the men approach the tennis court?” the cop asked Anita after ignoring my question altogether. 

Anita shook her head.

That was it. He likely would not even search the area, and I would be labeled a crazy person. My statement would be dismissed as overly emotional and dramatized if it was not judged as a hallucination. 

“She missed it because she went into the library to get some water,” I said as I tossed the racket onto the ground. “You have to believe me.”

“I’ll give you a log number from our dispatch so you can reference it if you get more information and want to do a follow-up,” he said as he ripped a page out from the notebook and handed it to me. “In the meanwhile, I’d recommend cooling down at home and getting some rest with your AC on high. People have been having heat strokes today.”

As we left I searched the perimeter for red stains on the ground. 

Nothing was there.

My place is a bungalow-style house I have lived in for over six years. 

I stepped in, shut the door behind me and placed my gym bag and car keys on the table. 

I petted my American shorthair cat named Germanotta as I passed by her on the way to my bedroom. She followed me down the small hallway and into the place where I slept as I flipped my entertainment system on and crawled into bed. She hopped up on the mattress and made herself comfortable as I put on a true crime program.

I opened the drawer of my nightstand and gripped a bottle of strong melatonin. I looked at the alarm clock and saw it was only six pm. 

I usually did not get any shut-eye until hours from now, but I contemplated taking two to pass out sooner. I yearned to eliminate the day from memory. 

I undid the cap and placed the tablets in my palm. I gazed at my water glass and saw it was empty. 

I let out a sigh of frustration as I grabbed it and went back into the kitchen. I took the pills and went back to bed. 

I drifted off and hoped I would not come to until noon the next day. 

My phone caused me to snap back to wakefulness. 

An alarm had been triggered by my security app connected to the surveillance system of my home.

I lifted the device and stared at it. ‘Motion detected close by,’ the message read. 

I scrolled down and stared at the camera perched above my front door.

The same film crew stood on the porch. 

The tallest one knocked. I could hear the rapping of his fists from my bedroom as I stood up and brought up the keypad on my screen to dial for help.

I minimized the screen and continued to wait for the dispatcher's voice as I maximized the video display again.

They were gone. 

The front of my domicile was now empty. 

The only things visible were the silhouettes of neighbors' houses in the distance and the row of parked cars along the curb. 

I searched for the silver van and it was not there.

I scrolled through the different feeds once more and could not see them on my property anywhere. 

I even rewound the footage and it showed no trespassers at any point in time. 

They had vanished with so much speed that I wondered if I had fallen victim to an anxiety-induced reverie. 

I went back to the phone screen and found the call had been disconnected as if they had hung up on me or a technical error had prevented them from going through.

Germanotta sat on the windowsill and stared at me.

The man with the boom was behind her outside. 

The pole tapped the glass and I recoiled off of the bed as I anticipated him shattering the screen to try and come in. 

I hit the floor and grabbed a butcher knife under the mattress I always kept there to feel safer. 

I have never considered myself particularly brave, but flight over fight had also never been an option for me. My father always drove me to self-defense classes when I was a child, and I was taught to assume that those who invaded my personal space had to be treated as though they had the worst intentions. 

I looked at the end of the blade and considered whether or not my physical strength would carry enough momentum for the tip of the knife to pierce through the pane and right into his face, neck or chest. 

I leaped towards the window and raised the blade. I knew to keep the weapon high and tight with the sharp end pointed towards the ceiling, the other free hand up the way a boxer maintains discipline with their shell or guard.

He was not there anymore. 

I cracked the window open and took in the scent of the dewy grass since the neighbor’s sprinklers had shut off moments ago. There were no shoe print indentations on the lawn either.

“Leave me alone,” I said. “Why me?”

*

Anita lived in an apartment complex downtown. I pulled into her private garage since she had managed to gift me a clicker for the underground parking years ago. 

I took the elevator to her floor and knocked. 

She answered in Vincent Van Gogh's ‘Starry Night’ pajamas. She was shocked to see me. 

“Is everything okay?”

“No,” I said as I walked in. 

Her place had statuettes of mythical figures at every corner, everything from sculpted dragons made of black marble and Greek monsters, the Minotaur and Medusa the most noticeable.

I explained to her the events of the night before. 

She had me sit down on her couch and offered me chocolate, although I was too preoccupied mentally to think about eating.   

“Did you call the police?”

“I tried and then gave up. They never came back.”

“You should still report it.”

“Anita, this is going to sound crazy, but…I think they’re professionals. They came and went without leaving a trace. Whenever I see them no one else seems to. I lose my voice every time they come near and I can’t explain why that even happens. I don’t know their motive for targeting me.”

Anita sighed and leaned back as she took a long sip from a coffee mug. 

“I know you’re an Agnostic,” she said. “Fair enough, I can’t tell you to believe what I do. Yet I think you should let me do your psychic reading now.”

“I did lose the bet,” I said through gritted teeth. 

I was not that interested in fulfilling my end of the bargain. I already had a steady stream of feeling haunted by something, and I did not want her weird energy through whatever bizarre ritual she had planned to use to upset me further. 

Nevertheless, I had to be a person of my word. 

Anita walked towards her closet and pulled out a leather satchel. She placed it on the cushion between us and pulled the glass table that sat in front of the sofa closer towards us.

She spread tea leaves on top of the surface. 

“Hold still and stay quiet,” she said.

“You don’t have a crystal ball?”

“You don’t need one. No one does. We all have the gift of entering the Akash, the field of invisible knowledge. The only preferable setting is a quiet and undisturbed one.”

“Whatever you say.”

She shushed me, closed her eyes, held my hand and sat still for fifteen minutes. 

Her eyelids opened. 

“This is what the guardians in the other told me,” she said. “Your ex has put a curse on you. He is using a team of conjured Familiars to follow you everywhere you go. The purpose is to spy on, undermine and harass you.”

I grew lightheaded and wanted to tell her that this was impossible but every fiber of my being believed it. 

My ex had always bragged about checking out books on black magick from the time he was an adolescent. At the time I merely considered this the behavior of a typical boy into heavy music and wearing eyeliner to punk rock shows.

As her words sunk in, it did occur to me that he was the type to summon something like that. 

A part of me still wanted to argue with her. I yearned to tell her it was her own cognitive biases regarding her own deeply held convictions about ethereal subjects and having consumed too many viral online Occultist methods.

Instead, I responded with what I knew was the right way to do so.

“How do I break his hex and get revenge?” I asked.

*

We stood in the center of the graveyard across the street from the Italian restaurant at two in the morning.

Anita held a mandrake, the rare and humanoid plant used in traditions of causing physical harm to others for centuries.

“Focus your intent on putting him in overwhelming amounts of pain,” she said. 

I considered whether or not I could go through with this. 

Perhaps I could do the ceremony to appease my friend and make her feel as though she did a favor. I could avoid the guilt of controlling someone’s fate by stating to myself that this was all futile gibberish anyway, a rite that would not have a genuine impact on reality.

Still, I did as she instructed.

Anita dug a ditch the size of a shoe box. 

She raised the mandrake in the air. 

“Let him feel the momentum of flight,” she said as she tossed the plant into the earth. She covered it and burnt incense that smelled of hazel.

We went back to her place and Anita was energized. I was quiet and tried to remind myself that this was likely nothing, a funny tale we would share later on. 

The next day Anita sent me a message. An article was attached.

‘MAN DIED IN CAR ACCIDENT EARLY THIS MORNING,’ the headline read. 

I felt my stomach turn. 

I had killed someone, even if I could not be prosecuted for it in any sensible court. 

I contemplated asking her if we could reverse it and if there was anything to be done that could counteract the feeling of being a murderer. 

What he had done was torment me, sure, but he did not enact a preternatural death on me.

I printed the article out and hung it on my bathroom mirror as a reminder. 

Remorse soon turned to rage. He left me with no other choice since he could not leave me alone.

I have not seen the documentary crew since. I have nightmares of silver vans to this day.
