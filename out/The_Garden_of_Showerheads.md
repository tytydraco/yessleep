(I got the following story from a video my missing friend, Nate Fredrickson, recorded. I don't know if he told the truth here. The family has talked to the neighbor and she claims she didn't talk to him that day.

I've decided to post my transcription of the video online to see if anyone can help with the search. If any of the people reading this notice anything strange in what Nate said or have any other information, please let me know.) 

Nate: I'm making this recording so that my friends and family members know what happened to me. I admit, after I did what I did, I at least deserved a good scare from my neighbor. However, I DON'T deserve what I believe will happen soon. 

I've tried pleading, reasoning, and screaming my apologies to my neighbor and I've gotten no response except the sounds of things breaking on the first floor of my home. I assume there's a search going on. Perhaps my neighbor only feels wrathful at this point. If so, this won't stop until I'm found. When that happens, I may die. 

If my neighbor didn't have that garden of showerheads, maybe I would've avoided all this. To clarify, when I use the term "showerheads", I'm not talking about a flower breed. My neighbor has literal showerheads, like the kind you find in a shower, all over her front and back yards. Somehow and for some reason, she found dozens of these, painted them in different colors, stuck fake leaves to them, and stuck them in her garden beds. 

Most of my neighbors found this art project bizarre but harmless. I agreed with them. Ask them and they'll tell you as much. I didn't mean what I said at all. 

Yesterday had just, well, got me right in the ass, to put it bluntly. I had to go to the vet to put my dog, Skipper, down. I felt like absolute garbage last night and couldn't get to sleep. Today, I wanted to do nothing but bum out, play video games, and eat delivery pizza. However, I must have stepped on a Bible or something, because God decided to send my neighbor over. 

A few minutes after I demolished the King of One Thousand Swords boss, she rang the bell. I would have ignored it, but I had already ordered the pizza. 

So now on top of my raging grief, I also had the mild disappointment of seeing my neighbor standing there instead of the pizza delivery guy. She had a nice smile that shone through her wrinkles and wore a cute flowery blouse, but that didn't help my mood. Still, I managed to talk politely when I asked her what she wanted. 

She told me what happened last night first. A windstorm had come by last night while I was emotionally preoccupied. The wind had caused some of her showerheads to fall over. She had gone to pick them up, but her arthritis-ridden back refused to let her bend over that day. She believed that the "nice young man" next door could help her pick them back up. I would even get paid twenty dollars for that small task.

It would have taken me ten minutes, but I just couldn't do anything that day. Yet, I didn't want to seem like an asshole. I think this inner conflict sent my emotions over the edge and I said what I shouldn't have said. 

"Why would I want to help you with your stupid art project?" 

I regretted the words immediately after they came out of my mouth. My neighbor's expression stretched with shock and then it scrunched up with anger. My already tense muscles became tenser. 

"I'm sorry," I said. "Yesterday was difficult. My dog died and…"

"Oh, so that gives you the right to be an asshole to everyone," my neighbor snapped. 

"Well, yanno, I'm grieving right now. I can't control myself all that well. Surely you can understand…" 

"Clearly!" 

She grabbed the knob and slammed the door in my face. I stood there for a few moments. Then I turned around, trudged back toward my couch, picked the controller up, and sat down. Only then did I realize I had lost the urge to play video games. I just wanted to sleep. 

I set the controller down on the coffee table, didn't bother to turn the game off, and let myself fall onto the couch cushion. A few moments after I pulled my legs up and stretched them out, I fell asleep. 

Thwack! Thwack! 

I awoke to these sounds at my window. I lifted my head until I could see it. A single pink showerhead covered in fake leaves floated there on the other side of the glass. I started chuckling. I stopped when I realized who could be under that showerhead and what she probably wanted. 

"Is that you, Ms…Ms…" I had forgotten my neighbor's name. "Um, is that you Ms. Neighbor? There's, uh, no need for violence. I meant what I said. About what I said, I mean. I mean, my apology was sincere." 

I rolled off the sofa and planted my feet on the ground. I crept over to the window as my neighbor continued to bang the showerhead against the window. The glass refused to break. I smirked and relaxed a little. 

"You probably won't break that. That window has tempered glass on it. It's also double-paned." I stopped about a foot away from the window. "Look, just put that thing away, Ms. Neighbor. Let's talk about this like reasonable people." 

The showerhead stopped moving for a few moments. Then it began shaking. 

"Oh…you…you don't need to feel afraid." I leaned over the window sill so I could look into my neighbor's eyes. "I just want to–" 

A long pink tube sat by itself on the ground. It shook at the same rate as that pink showerhead. With my eyes, I followed the tube back up to the showerhead. I gasped. The metal on the showerhead had started to budge in places. These bulges moved chaotically. I froze, feeling both fascinated and terrified by the sight. 

In no time at all, the bulges split open and more showerheads, complete with fake leaves, emerged. These then became nearly twice the size of the original showerhead in just a few moments. 

After about a dozen showerheads emerged and grew, the glass smacking continued with more force. This entire showerhead tree threw itself against the glass with shocking speed and strength. The frame shook. I broke out of my shock and backed up before turning around and sprinting up the stairs. The moment I slammed the bedroom door, I heard the glass shatter below. 

So that's what happened and why I'm here. I said something bad to my neighbor and, even though I apologized, she…uh…sent this showerhead monster after me. Heh. It's kinda funny, in a way. I would be laughing if I wasn't so terrified.

I love you all and I'm sorry that I put you through this. I won't make you watch what's gonna happen next.

(A week has passed and we've yet to find Nate. I want to believe he just decided to go away for some time, but I don't think that's the case. We will continue trying. [Thanks in advance](https://www.reddit.com/r/frerkinghorrorstories/) to anyone who tries to help.)
