I always thought it was cool that my grandma lived beside a morgue. I was always into scary stories and a lot of them had to do with foolhardy kids, trespassing on places where the dead were resting. In those younger years i used to ask my grandma if i could sleep over her house, with the intention of doing such nefarious things. 

She would always see right through my guise and turn me down, saying that maybe i could spend the night when i was older. Though she never defined what “Older” meant to her. As it wasn’t until her passing that i was finally granted access. Not only that, i was surprised to find that she had given me the house in her will. Just handed it on over, i suppose i was the closest one to her in the family but i always assumed the house would just go to waste when she was gone.

A lot happened after that. I had never bought a house before so i thought everything that occurred was just how it worked. Though in hindsight it was enough of a warning on what was to come. First, before i was allowed to move in a few men in fitted suits showed up to my little one room apartment. They looked straight out of a movie, all business and sunglasses. They told me they had known my grandma for years and  “Appriciated her cooperation and discretion in regards to the home.”

I was understandably rather perplexed by this as they insisted that they hoped i would be of similar ilk. Trying to pry further information out of them yielded next to nothing, only a handful of letters. One was a check, a very sizable check. One of the men said to consider it something like “A government grant”. There was a document that came with this, they needed rights to visit the grounds while i was living there. 

It was more money than i had ever seen, more than i ever conceived of acquiring so of course i signed it, with very little reading. The house was also paid for in full and for whatever reason, i only had to pay a water and heating bill. They also handed me a letter written for my by my grandma. The wound of her passing was pretty fresh so i didn’t have it in me to open and read what was inside, despite the behest of the men in suits. They eventually relented.

Before they left they informed me that some men would be over to help me move my things, telling me that house needed someone inside of it as soon as possible. And so within a few hours, i was standing in the house, boxes of clothing and nick-nacks all strewn about. The air was stale, it allowed the scent of my grandma’s perfume to linger, it made the place feel more inviting.

Within the hours of sunlight i put away as much as i could and tried to rearrange furniture to my liking. Eventually the sun began to dip beyond the horizon and the faint yellow lights grandma used to avoid hurting her sensitive eyes, flickered on one by one. I made a mental note to get some bulbs that were a little more natural. I was pretty tired with everything the day ppresented and as darkness took the city i laid down on the couch in the living room.

My eyes were heavy and with each passing minute i felt them pulled further down and just as i was about to drift off, i heard a scratch. With me waning into the land of dreams i assumed it was just an artifact from being on the verge of sleep. That was until i heard it again, this time with my eyes wide open. Sitting up on the couch surrounded in twilight i tried to remember if Grandma had any pets. She didn’t.

Another scratch happened, this time though it sounded like two separate instances of it, from two different parts of the house. Rising from the couch i looked around, suddenly remembering i had never spent the night there. I had only seen the house with a blanket of sunlight, it looked so alien in the dark. The scratching, it started happening more rapidly, my heart racing as i could hear it happening in more places. 

I was going to head to the front door, to try and get a look outside but when i moved to i saw through the front window. Someone was on my porch, pressed up against the glass, it looked like they were dragging their fingers across the glass. I was all too aware of just how cold that night was, the still chill pressing against the sweat on my arm. The body outside the window swayed back and forth all while fingernails etched the glass.

Mind a flurry my first instinct kicked in and I ran over to the kitchen, as I moved I became more and more aware of the scratching, how it was all around my new home. With my hands trembling, I lowered my body to get out of sight and dialed 911. The phone rang for a moment before I heard a strange buzz, like radio static and then a click. A stern a surly voice spoke through the receiver. 

The man said my name, catching me off guard and stuffing my frantic words back down my throat. He asked me if there was a problem, my speech was mumbled and frantic but I did my best to explain the situation. There was a moment of silence and then the man briefly spoke to figures in the background. In so many terms, the man said that the scratching was something I was going to get used to. 

He assured me that the house was fortified and that the people outside my home wouldn’t have the muscle mass to break in. There were questions, I had so many but when I asked them he just repeated what he had already said in a different way. The last thing he told me was a suggestion, to buy a white noise machine. What stuck with me most was him telling me that “Someone has to be inside that house.”

After hanging up my fingers dialed 911 again, same buzz, same click, same man telling me I'd have to deal with it. Eventually I gave up, I wasn't about to try and call someone I knew and try to explain the situation, I was likely to be admitted that way. Instead I sat in the kitchen listening to the scratching until drifting off. 

With the morning upon me I exited the house and surveyed the exterior of it. I couldn’t see any blemishes on the house. No scratches deep enough for visible damage, the only evidence that the night before really happened were the footsteps that covered my yard. Small puddles of dirt and parted grass, all of them, leading to the morgue next door. I never recalled seeing anyone go in or out of the morgue. 

I walked over there once since moving into my grandma’s house. I was met with one of those suited up men, a real big guy who made it clear he was armed. There wasn’t a chance I was going to risk breaking into there. The next night after I started hearing the scratching I got a little braver. Walked a little closer to the front window and when I could almost make out details of the figure on the other side, my nerves got to me and I stepped away.

Opting to go upstairs into my room, the scratching was much fainter there. Could hardly hear it at all. I figured if my Grandma had to deal with this as well then she might have invested in soundproofing the room as much as she could. Though there were so many figures scratching from all over it would be impossible to drown them all out. As I laid there, listening to the scratching from downstairs, eyes getting heavier, I found myself enjoying it. Or at the very least being soothed by it. A white noise machine wasn’t necessary.

The next day I nervously awaited for the sun to dip down. Sitting on the couch as the room got darker and darker. As the world died out, I watched the time like a hawk, 10:30 is when I heard the first scratch. It was immediately followed by another and unsurprisingly I was surrounded by the noise in moments. With a heavy breath I steeled myself to face the strange intruders. Rising from the couch I felt like I was wearing ankle weights, each step heavier than the last.

Flashlight in hand I reached the glass that separates me from them. Turning it on the beam shot through the glass and illuminated the face on the other side. I could feel a hard rhythmic pounding against the inside of my ribcage. The flashlight started to creak as my fingers tightened around it, the grooved pattern dug into my skin. Pressed against the window, was a gaunt and tattered face.

A man, his skin seemed to be flaking off and portions of it were hanging loosely, stretched and pulled as he moved his face along the glass. It looked as though at any moment he would tear his skin right off. It was right out of a zombie flick, one of his eyes was a sickly green hue that hazed over the white portions. Those eyes watched me as well as they could, every so often rolling around like they weren’t connected to anything. The green orbs would shutter for a moment and focus back on me.

Backing away from the window, fighting every urge to bolt out the front door, I took in the view in front of me. The cracked and blackened fingernails that chipped against the glass. The man’s rotting suit and tie that looked to be caked in fluids that I dare not try to recognize. And he wasn’t alone, there were others on the porch scratching at the windows. Some were in full view while I could only make out limbs from the others.

All the bodies were in varying states of decay. I walked around the house, slowly my nerves settled with each face I saw. The fear would occasionally flare back up when I came across a figure that hardly resembled a human. Desolated muscle tissue exposed, I could see the inner workings of articulating jaws as the undead moaned. Eyes hung loose in socks and teeth rattled around agape mouths.

Sometimes it was fingernails scratching the house and other times it was exposed bone pressing against the windows. That was the worst, the high pitched squeal that would emit from bodies too far gone to have skin left on their hands. I couldn’t imagine how some of them were even able to move their frames. Over time I got used to it. My nightly routine, the grant I had received was so large that it just became worth it? 

You can learn to live with anything. The scratching was annoying after a long day or when I was having a rough time falling asleep. It wasn’t too different from some apartments I've lived in though. I’d pick the scratching over the sound of crying children in the apartment above me any day. I even named a few of them which I recognize as pretty sick. The first zombie I saw? I called him Frank, he just… really looked like a Frank.

I would of course still be unsettled at times. I would still worry that they might find a way in. That an undead fresh enough might show up with the muscle mass required to break in. On those nights, when the thoughts got to me. I’d sit on the couch and watch, listening carefully for any noise that might present a warning. Everytime something squeaked too loudly or I heard an unusually guttural growl from one of the undead, my skin would crawl before settling. 

It took a while to come to terms with it all but I did. My Grandma lived there for decades without ever having a problem. The checks kept coming in and though I didn't have to work, I found a job, just to get me out of the house, always making sure to be back before ten. Once I got used to it, I figured I wouldn't be able to fall asleep without listening to the scratching, it just became a part of life. I might not be able to bring anyone over to spend the night but I would certainly never be alone.

My contact with the men in suits was minimal. Whatever questions I had, they stopped mattering over time. The house became a home and the other tenets always paid rent on time. I made it my own and moved more modern furniture in. A nice comfortable bed and some electronics to fill the place out. I was all set to just live in peace. Just me and all my ghouslish friends.

I was a bit disappointed one night when 10:30 rolled around and on my way upstairs I observed that Frank was no longer on the porch. Flashlight in hand again I scanned the front window trying to get sight of his gray suit but he wasn’t there. He never missed a day, always stood right at the front window, tapping. Just to be sure I scoured the faces visible from the other windows. All the other regulars were there, except Frank.

That feeling I got the first night, the feeling of sinking into the ocean. It resurfaced when, for a moment past the horde of undead, I caught a glimpse of something else. It was brief but when my flashlight reached across the backyard I saw a set of hanging red dots. They were small and off a few feet from the house. It looked like a pair of eyes but all the undead were always right up against the house, pushing through each other and pressing against the panels.

After seeing it I just convinced myself that it was a trick of the light. Maybe it was just a late participant, though I knew all too well that light reflecting off the undead’s eyes didn’t make them glow like that. I waved my flashlight over the spot I had seen the lights but nothing was there. Suddenly, taken out of routine, the faces pressed against the glass seemed less friendly than I had convinced myself they were. 

They were trying to get to me, trying to get inside my home to eat me and until the morning came, I was trapped. All it would take was one mistake. I had to push these thoughts out of my head. It was just my eyes filling in space, seeing something that wasn’t there. I managed to get to sleep, though the scratching was louder than it typically was. I swear I could hear the absence Frank left behind.

It was the same the next night. The undead showed up one by one and I did the usual walk to make sure everything was locked up for the night. I looked over all the faces. Marth and Avery were missing too and a few of the nameless undead were gone too. I couldn’t tell if there were less of them. Just that if there was the same amount, new ones had to have shown up to fill the holes left behind. 

There was a new sense of isolation, forces working beyond me I didn't have a grasp on. And worse, the distance. Beyond the treeline of dead and harrowing faces that only wanted to feed on me. A set of two red eyes shrouded in darkness. And another, and another. Not nearly as dense as the undead right in front of me, but there were a handful of them. I was up all night and only managed to sleep during the day.

So when my eyes opened and it was already night time I felt a shock run through my body, i couldn’t hear any scratching so i thought i still had time. Springing up off the couch and giving a quick glance to the front window, there were no undead shambling towards me. A relief, I still had time to check everything. As I moved to the front door I caught sight of the glowing green digital clock in the kitchen. 

The blood drained from my face and a chill covered me and i read the display informing me it was midnight, yet, there wasn’t a sound. Not a single instance of scratching. It felt so wrong. I had gotten used to it, that noise was part of the home. The world had never been more quiet than it was within that night. I’d of thought my house had been catapulted into space. I quickly stepped to the front window, the porch and street lights were out so I couldn't make anything out.

Maybe the smart thing to do was grab my flashlight but that’s not what I did. I walked to the front door and before I gave myself time to think rationally, I opened it. Out on the front porch I turned my head. Out of view under the window was a clump of bodies all folded over each other, all the undead laying there somehow more lifeless than before. My eyes were slowly adjusting to the dark and I could see them clearer.

It was hard to tell if they were any worse off but I could see they had been battered in old and crusty blood. Just enough light coming from inside the house to see their clothing all stained a horrible red. It looked like chunks of them were missing, not like before where it looked like parts rotted off. It looked like they were removed.

My feet retreated when I saw a set of those red eyes watching me from the street. Like prey, I could feel myself being watched. It wasn’t just the set I could see through. I felt myself being surrounded, just like the first night. One by one, figures rose up in the yard and turned to me. One set of eyes appeared after the other until a line of orbs were staring at me. My body refused me.

“Someone has to be inside that house.” I heard, deep and gravel filled voice speak out from the road. The street light flickered, quick flashing of lights revealing the figure under it. A man, dressed in a prim and proper black suit, the very same man who had given me the deed to the house. His eyes a bright crimson, stains of red on his lips. The light offered enough to see the others in the yard. I understood my place on the food chain. 

Those people, all hunched over having just devoured what was left of the undead that were lured to my home, by me. The undead need life, they yearn to eat from a still beating heart. Surely there are creatures that feed on the undead though, that’s how ecosystems work. As I slowly backed up into my house, I realized my status in that home wasn’t as voluntary as I initially thought. I was there, as bait. Someone needed to be in that house. I was a lamp for the moths. And only when it was feeding time, does the scratching end. 

Right next to a morgue was the perfect spot. I can only assume how this all works, as I doubt I'll get any real answers. The recently deceased are shipped to and guarded in the morgue. That way, they can be kept in storage until nighttime, where instead of traveling into town and wreaking havoc, they go to the nearest home and try to get inside. Until enough bodies collect or some feeding cycle, where the suited ones return and clear them out.

I don’t mind the scratching, I welcome it.


I hate when it stops.
