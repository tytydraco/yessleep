My name is Peter and I’m a security guard at the library for the college I attend. I wont disclose the name just in case I’d like to keep this slog of a job.  I’m going to cut the bullshit exposition and get straight to the point: I think I went to hell and back. 

I was alone, and the security manager had trusted me to guard the library for the night shift. The building is large and complex with its labyrinth of books and computers. The school wanted to save as much money as possible, so floors 2,3,4, and the basement had been completely shut down of power, leaving the first floor to myself for light. That, and this cheaply made Temu flashlight the security office decided to give me. The night started like any other, the loud buzzing of fluorescent bulbs above, with their sub-par dusting job, and the idle printers low gurgle ensured that I’d stay awake from a sensory standpoint. Before mustering the courage to secure and explore the other floors, I decided to start with the first level as the lights gave me a sense of presence in the empty halls.

The walls were lined with windows but since there were no street lamps present outside of the library, the pitch black glass stared at me like a porthole of a submarine. Walking, I listed the rows of books by catalogue to mark down what isles were absent of any freshmen fucking or other small things I’ve came across working here like a raccoon eating “The Great Gatsby”. I started left to right: Fiction 1, clear. Fiction 2 clear, Fiction 3, clear. Historical fiction 1, can’t see. The bulb above was out and the way the rows were positioned made it so the lights only illuminated a single row at a time. I pulled out my flashlight and flick it on, dimly stuttering to life as I smack the side. Clear. Except there’s a single book on the top row sticking out, leaning into the isle, it’s worn cover barely holding on. I pull out “The Life of Peter: Molded in the Master’s Hands”. My stomach sank as I realized that this was intentional. The book had been touched recently, a hand gripping stain of water or some other liquid still wet caressed the spine. Shaking, I opened the book, noticing every single page having many square-cut holes where a four letter word would be. My mind knew that the only thing it could be was

“peter” a soft spoken voice behind me spoke aloud. Before I could turn around to face it, a cold, long-fingered hand gripped me over my right shoulder. I couldn’t move my head, but out of the corner of my eye I could make out what appeared to look like a hand, except green and flakey with exposed deep red craters in her skin that had a putrid smell of burnt flesh and mold. I still couldn’t move. My legs gave out as I was on my knees begging to let me live. The thing let out a gurgling whisper “Dominus vobiscum”. I suddenly regained control of my body and when I turned she was gone. This marked the start of what I believe was my journey into Hell.
