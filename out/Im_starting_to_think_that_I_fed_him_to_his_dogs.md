“What’s your name?” The lady squinted, presumably looking for a name tag. 

A cloud of breath puffed past my cracked lips. “Andy.”

“Andy… you poor thing. You look like you’re freezing to death out here,” she said with a laugh. “If you think this is cold, you ought to come back home with me. We’d be wearing shorts in this weather.” After digging into her heavy winter coat, she handed me a crumpled bill. “Do yourself a favor and get some long johns. You’ll thank me later.”

“Thanks.” I stiffly tucked it away, loaded the last case of water into her SUV, and, after a few more rounds of small talk, shuffled off to return her buggy. 

Two lines of shopping carts sprawled out of the corral, dangerously inching towards the road. I stacked as many as I could, but considering the wind could almost blow me away, it really wasn’t a lot. Still, I shoved off, hauling my little train back to the store.

Halfway there, a new car ripped into the packed parking lot. They were heading for SUV lady’s old spot and cut me off before I had time to stop. I dug my heels into the asphalt and folded over the handlebars, barely grabbing the front cart. It tugged on my arm. It tugged on my arm pretty hard, actually. I’d spend the rest of the day worried I’d pulled something. Guess that’s why I didn’t see the new hole in my pocket at first. 

I gathered my bearings, grit my teeth, and pressed on as a light snowfall started. We only had one other cashier, Daniel, and in the time it took me to load those waters, a line from produce all the way to dairy had formed. On my way through the lobby, everyone’s eyes were on me.

Slinging the buggies in with the others, I then booked it to my register. Before logging on- and I remember this distinctly- I reached into my jacket, taking the name tag off my uniform and slapping it over my breast pocket. At the time, it definitely said:

“Hello! My name is Sasha.” 

Someone said the four letter “S“ word in the south. That’s right: “Snow.” 

Bread, milk, and toilet paper flew off shelves as soon as they were stocked. One person in a hurry would check out, and like a retail hydra, three people in bigger hurries would take their place. Our manager tried to help when she could. Unfortunately, she was also stuck with changing the weekly tags, and wrong tags brought everything to a screeching halt. Cashiers couldn’t change prices or take things off on their own, which meant we had to call the manager, which meant she wasn’t changing tags or running a register, which would stress everyone out even more, which- which- which-

It’s a wonder the dam didn’t burst before Beer Guy showed up. Thirty minutes after the parking lot incident, an older fellow came barreling up to my register with a large bag of dog food and a box full of those single serve beers. 

“Hello~” I said in my best customer service accent. 

“Nine, eighteen, fifty-seven,” Beer Guy answered, heaving his things onto my belt.

It was hard to catch what he said at first. Thinking it might’ve been a greeting, I brushed past it and scanned his dog food. When the beer rolled up, I set a hand over it and paused.  “I’ll just see your ID right quick~”

“Nine. Eighteen. Fifty-seven.”

I blinked. “I’m… sorry. I have to see an ID.” 

“That’s not what your sign out there says. I’m over thirty. You don’t need it.”

I paused and tried to think about the sign he was talking about. “That’s… that’s just for cigarettes. We have to card everyone for alcohol.”

Daniel, whose register was facing mine, glanced up at that. I saw a look of recognition briefly flash across his face before his mouth flatlined. “He needs to see your ID, sir.”

Beer Guy looked over his shoulder. “I don’t need lip from you today, boy.”

“I’m required to ask for it,” I continued, heart rate picking up. “I have a camera over my register, and I could get in trouble if I don’t-“ 

“-That’s not what your sign says though.”

Daniel gestured at the “No ID, No Alcohol, No Exceptions” sign over my register. “How about you read that one there?”

Beer Guy snapped back, and the two began tearing into one another. I tried to interject, but adding my voice into the mix only made everyone get louder and less comprehensible. At one point, I simply turned away and started repeating, “I need to see an ID. I need to see an ID. I need-“ 

Finally, Beer Guy shouted, “Then change your damn sign!” He cracked open his wallet and threw a driver’s license at me.

My entire body was quaking, fingers barely working as I punched in his info as fast as possible. Then, slamming his card down on the counter, I snatched the cash out of his hand and made his change. 

I couldn’t face him as he gathered his things, but before he left, I added in a theatrical passive-aggressiveness, “I hope you have a fan-tabulous day~!” 

“Don’t quit your day job,” Beer Guy grumbled, shoving his cart out the front doors.

The backdoor receiver popped up behind me. “Hey, what’s…?” 

“Get Angela, Johnny,” Daniel demanded. “Just. Just get Angela.” 

Our manager, Angela, turned a corner before Johnny could even leave. At least by that point, the wave of customers was dying down a little. Daniel tried to explain what happened as I finished ringing up my last person. 

I shook my head, raising my hands in the air. “I shouldn’t have served him. I should’ve just said no even when he gave me his license. He was trying to test boundaries, to see how much we’ll let him get away with. I should’ve refused. I should’ve-”

“Johnny.” Angela turned to ask, “How many more vendors you got?”

“Ehh… I think maybe one? I don’t know, he’s always hit-or-miss.”

“If he comes, I’ll take care of him. Go ahead and hop on register for me. Sasha?” I know she said Sasha. “Go home.”

“No, I’m fine,” I insisted. “I can finish the shift, just- Just give me a second.”

Truth be told, I wasn’t even supposed to be there that day. Someone had called in at the last minute, and I was the first one they rang. It didn’t take much convincing to get me out of there, but I still felt bad about it.  

By the time I left, a light dusting of snow had already coated the ground, and it was coming down pretty steadily. My guilt was quickly replaced with a gratefulness for getting out early. Unfortunately, I lived a little off the beaten path, and things up there could get a bit scary when the weather got rough.

As I drove closer to the lake, the fog started to pick up. Everything turned hazy, the icy mixed precipitation pelting my roof and windshield. Wind rocked my car as I made my way up the narrowly carved mountain roads. The closer you got to my cabin, the slimmer they became. If another vehicle came from the opposite direction, I’d have to pull over and stop completely. Thankfully, I didn’t cross paths with anyone before I pulled in, but when a four-legged blur zoomed across the driveway, I slammed the brakes.

The only other structure for miles was an old barn up on the hill. I had a few dogs and a pig kept up there. The key word is: “Had.” At that moment, almost all of them were running around the yard. 

“Hey!” I whistled, getting out of my car. “HEY!” Six or so dogs perked their heads up, and the moment I stepped forward, they scattered in all directions. To be fair, they were long haired dogs that loved the cold, but the land wasn’t fenced in. Plus, the storm was getting a little too strong for comfort. 

I headed for the heated barn to ransack our stash of treats. Its door was left wide open, blowing from side to side with the latch wiggled loose. I’m not sure how she would’ve done it, but my blame is still on the husky. The pig, of course, hadn’t moved at all and was curled up in a warm corner. 

With a little bit of coaxing and a lot of peanut butter nuggets, I reeled the dogs back in one by one, making sure to secure the latch with each addition. However, on my final run, bringing the husky herself, the wind actually blew me away. It knocked me forward, face first into the snow and straight onto my bad arm. A feeling of icy needles stabbed into my shoulder. As I layed there for a moment, pushed down by the elements and unable to move, the husky took the treat from my hand, licked my face, and disappeared. 

I struggled to my knees, blinded by the sweeping weather as it closed in. My voice was swallowed by the wind as I called her name. She was nowhere to be seen. Before things could get much worse, I trudged to the cabin. 

That’s when I found the hole in my pocket. After cranking up the heat and thawing my bones, I was going to text my family about the storm. They were further south and likely wouldn’t get hit as hard. Still, I knew Mom would be worried about me being alone up here. However, when I reached to grab my phone, my hand went straight through the cloth. Shit. I didn’t have a landline. 

We made due with what we could, though. The rest of the evening went on as normal. I fixed a nice, hot meal, curled up on the couch in front of the fireplace, and logged onto my laptop. Thank God there was still an internet connection. I shot my cousin a message through our server, letting them know what was going on and started doing some animation work. At the time, I was working on a hobby series, just something for fun. Or, at least, that’s what I would say if you asked me. In reality, I eventually wanted to create full-time, and the show was bringing in a tiny bit of money already. 

It was published under a pseudonym. My parents were, admittedly, a little strict growing up. When I snuck online, I’d create these fake names so they’d never find me, and the habit carried over into adulthood, I guess. Never saw the harm in them, as long as you weren’t, you know, catfishing or otherwise taking advantage of anybody. In fact, I saw it as good privacy hygiene. For every new hobby I took up, I’d whip up another persona to keep everything neat, tidy, and separated. 

I went to bed early, and my power must’ve gone out not long after that. It was freezing cold before dawn, waking me up even with every blanket in the house. I shuffled downstairs with a heavy quilt around my shoulders and started up the fireplace again, using the last of the firewood. The internet was completely gone, of course, but my laptop’s battery was at 10% anyways.

I waited for the sun to rise before going out. Now, I’m not a hunter or a huge gun fanatic by any means, but I did have a handgun locked in a cabinet beside the front door. We lived at least twenty minutes from civilization, and you never know what could be crawling around. If I was staying outside for the day, I always had it on my hip. 

The landscape had transformed into a pristine, glittering wonderland, and getting up the hill was a nightmare. Inside the barn, I broke out blankets for the critters and filled their food bowls. After making sure everyone else was accounted for, we took a walk around the property to look for my husky. No luck. At the end of the day, all I could do was go home and grab some firewood from the chopping block next to the barn. 

Three days later, things still hadn’t thawed, the power was still off, and we were getting low on animal food. I resorted to cracking open canned meat and other things from the pantry to feed them, but even then we had to ration. For three days, I ate cold beans and other vegetables straight from the tin. Between that and the cabin fever, I started feeling miserable. 

Without the internet and unable to go anywhere, it was a great opportunity to clean up the house a bit. I rummaged through the closets, organizing them, and finding some things that I hadn’t seen in a while. The biggest surprise, however, was pulling out the old typewriter I’d gotten for my birthday.

Despite not using it before, it was still in pristine condition. The keys were outlined in a beautiful, glossy black that perfectly accented its burgundy casing. As I took it up, the light caught it in a way that made it shine like a vintage car. 

Now was as good a time as ever. I brought it before the crackling fireplace, set it on the coffee table, and lit a few wax candles to bring in more light. Finding some paper, I loaded it into the machine, sat on the floor, and immediately got writer’s block. 

Minutes passed as I drummed my fingers to the beat of the battery powered clock on the wall. My head turned to the ceiling as I searched for- something. Anything to write about. It had been years since I tried prose instead of scripts, and the permanence of ink to page was daunting. I couldn’t just backspace if I made a mistake. Every word had to be perfect the first time. So, I started things slow with a little exercise. Something short. Something simple. Something like, a fictional version of my day or maybe my week.

It was easiest to begin with a title. I typed out, “A Snow Day by Sasha-” Glancing around the room, my eye caught a book on the shelf beside my fireplace. I don’t remember what it was, exactly. It might’ve been an old classic or a collection of Slavic fairy tales, but I siphoned the surname from it.

With a few words committed to the page, we were off to the races. What usually took hours to get out of my head now happened in minutes. Fingers flew around the keyboard like I was performing a typing test. Hours of focus hunched over the short table strained my eyes, giving me a splitting headache, but before too long, I had an entire manuscript at my fingertips. As I collected the pages, though, something started scratching at my front door.

My eyes snapped up, brain still washed in an imaginative haze. I tentatively rose and crept up to the windows, peeling the blinds open with a single hand. The husky was at the door. 

When I opened it, my dog shot into the living room like a cannon. She whimpered, ran up and down the furniture, and started “husky-talking” to me. The entire time, her gaze was fixated on the woods beyond our property. I peered out with her. A light snow had started up again. It took me a moment to actually see it, but beyond the tree line, there were signs of movement. Small black masses expanded and contracted, weaving between the trees. The husky growled at them, but on reaching to comfort her, she took off for the kitchen. I glanced up at the barn to make sure it hadn’t come open again, but we were secure. It wasn’t any of my animals out there. No way I was going out to investigate, either. I locked the doors tight and closed every shutter in the house. Before heading up, I popped an ibuprofen, and then I locked my bedroom door.

I spent the night drawing lines. The medication took out that headache fairly quickly, but a fever sprang up in its place. I tossed, turned, flipped my pillow over, and tried what I could. However, even without heating, a steady stream of sweat soaked right through my pajamas. I assumed that’s why I must’ve ripped them off at one point. 

Moving at all threw my balance as if I was flipping around on a water slide. When I laid still and faced the ceiling, my mind became a box of static. It’s hard to describe. I couldn’t see anything at all, but it felt like my brain was drawing lines in the air above me. They twisted, swirled, and looped around without intersecting. The sensation only stopped when twisting, swirling, and looping around my waist was a stranger’s arm. 

My breath hitched. All four limbs shot out automatically, both nailing the man and throwing myself to the floor. Most of the covers came along with me. I grappled with them, struggling to get untangled before crawling back into the wall. As our eyes met, we both froze. 

It was like someone propped up a mirror on my bed. He had the same disheveled hair, the same horrified expression, and when we screamed, we screamed with the same voice.

Curling the remaining sheets around himself, the intruder fumbled the lock and ran out of the room. All my limbs felt like electrocuted, semi-numb sacks of gelatin. Unwieldy. Painful. Coordinating anything seemed impossible, and getting to my feet was a fantasy. I tripped over the blankets. I tripped over myself. I tripped over the threshold, which flung me forward into the landing’s railing. However, as I peered between the bars, a shockwave of adrenaline shot down my spine and gave my body a hard reset. He was in the gun cabinet.

My legs launched me upright and sent us scrambling downstairs. At the same time, the other man was pointing my gun at the ground, trying to rack it back. It didn’t work. His hand slipped over it again and again, failing to get a good grip.

On reaching the bottom step, I lunged. He staggered back only a little as I latched onto his wrists. We twisted around in a dangerous tug-o-war, still somehow mindful of the loaded weapon. Its muzzle pointed down during the entire scuffle. However, we were at an impasse. The two of us looked to have the exact same weight and muscle mass.

In a frenzied attempt to get the upper hand, I bit him. Sunk my teeth into his exposed shoulder and squeezed with the full force of the human jaw. He cried out at the top of his lungs, right into my ear, but it wasn’t nearly as loud as the gunshot.

Everything happened in less than five seconds. His grip loosened just enough to jerk the handgun away. I took a step back, racked it on the first try, and panicked- pulling the trigger too soon. The sound left my ears ringing; the recoil sent me staggering back; and the intruder fell to the ground, surrounded by the remaining bits of his kneecap. 

Still, there was no time to lose. I went for the front door, barely cracking it when a strong gust of wind ripped it from my fingers. The snow was now coming down in a relentless torrent, harder than it was the day before. Anything past the front porch disappeared into a milky white void. 

Turning back to the intruder, I leaned in to grab him by his ankles. As I got closer, his arm shot out in an attempt to grip my scalp. However, before he could twist my hair around his fingers, I yanked. I don’t know what shook me harder: the shot of arterial blood to my face or the look in his eyes as he stopped fighting. His left leg, now six inches longer, was barely holding on by a threadbare tendon. I gagged.

I thought he might’ve passed out. Hoped, even. But as I left him on the porch and backed into the house, I watched as the snow consumed him, very much awake, very much alive. Bit by bit, it erased the existence of his body. In the end, all that remained was a pure white blanket and a pair of angry, piercing blue eyes. I slammed the door on them.

There was no going back to sleep that night. My brain went into autopilot, and I found myself mopping up the bloodied wooden floor. The stain wouldn’t come out, and neither would my husky. When I went into the kitchen, she was inconsolable. Her panic was worse than when she entered. So, I left her alone, draped a rug over the floor, lit a candle, and stayed on the couch: watching, waiting, listening. The wind wailed all night long, or at least, I chose to believe it was the wind. It should have drowned out any and all sounds that came from outside. 

But he was scratching at the door. For what felt like hours, he pawed at it like a sick pup. I took the throw pillows from the couch and covered my head with them, jammed fingers into my ear canals, but it was no use. He scratched and scratched at the walls of my brain, and it only got louder with every passing minute.

In a sleep deprived rage, I eventually stood up and started screaming at the door, “Shut up! Shut UP! SHUTUPSHUTUPSHUTUP!” Maybe I blacked out after that. Maybe it worked. Either way, I didn’t hear the scratches again, and the wind stopped too.

I awoke feeling blissful. For a grand total of ten seconds, there was no recollection of the night before. My muscles were stiff, my head was a little muddied, but I was overall feeling good. As I had a nice stretch, my back popped, and the memory came flooding back. My stomach bottomed out. 

It took me all day to gather courage and go outside. Bundling up tight in the evening light, I opened the front door, and he was right at the threshold. 

His arm was frozen in midair, its fingers rough, bloodied, and reaching for the door. Now that I was up close, I could see that every freckle, mole, and acne scar on his deep blue skin were exactly the same as mine. His glossed over eyes were wide open, still staring right at me. The eye contact broke as my husky timidly walked up behind us, and she started licking his face.

I didn’t even make it outside when I threw up. For a good while, I stood with my back to the body and retched until my stomach was completely empty. When I looked back, it started up again, making me dry heave until my muscles gave out. With a hand on the doorframe, I shook, trying to think about what to do. I couldn’t call anybody. Couldn’t contact anyone at all. The ground was frozen, and hell, I couldn’t have a whole body buried on my property. It might sound drastic. It might sound awful. I know it does, but it was the only thing I could think of to get rid of him- of it entirely. So, going back inside, I grabbed some sheets. 

I pulled his body up to the barn with the dogs, the pig, and the firewood axe on my mind. None of my animals went hungry that night.

It took a while for everything to thaw out completely. Even then, the grocery store never saw me again. No surprise, I withdrew from society a little. I thought I’d live off savings from my last job and maybe the income from my animations. That didn’t quite work out, though. Friendships, relationships, and even my mailbox were neglected in favor of staying inside. Thankfully, my bills were automated online. Still, the money has only lasted about a year. The new plan was to look for another job after the holiday season. 

I did get a new phone right away, though. At the very least, everyone in my family received a call to let them know, “Hey, this is Sasha, and I didn’t die in the blizzard.” 

By the end of the year, things were starting to lighten up again. After some time, I was reaching out to make new friends and started seeing my current partner. Then, I even visited my family. 

On Christmas day, I made the two hour drive down to my parents’ house. When Mom opened the door, though, she had a strange smile welcoming me in. As we did presents, extended family members exchanged nervous glances anytime I spoke. At first, I chalked it up to things being awkward since we hadn’t seen each other in a while. However, during dinner, there was a different sort of tension in the air, hovering above our heads. I felt completely disconnected from them, like an elephant in the room. Eventually, I cornered one of my cousins to ask him what was going on. 

“Oh?” He scratched the back of his head. “Yeah, I don’t think anybody was gonna intrude and ask, but I guess everyone was just expecting you to have, like, started transitioning by now.”

“...Huh?”

His eyes widened. “OH… Oh, did we misread the whole thing?”

“What thing?” I asked, genuinely curious.

“Well. I mean. When you came out to everyone with your new name, Sasha. I know it can be a guy’s name, too, obviously, but it just. It’s more popular for women in the anglosphere, you know? So we just thought- You know.” I started zoning out. He kept going. “Which, hey! We supported you before, and we support you now, even if. That’s not what’s going on. And if it’s not, if you don’t mind me asking… Why did you change your name?”

How many times does a person look at their official papers? I mean really, really look at them? If someone’s not constantly doing anything that requires them, how often does the average person thoroughly examine their documents? Does anybody even read their drivers licenses after getting or renewing them? I certainly didn’t. However, as I sat in my car before going home, I grabbed my wallet, took my driver’s license out, and read it. 

I tore the cabin upside down when I got back. The overstuffed mailbox nearly came off its stand as I ripped it open. Furniture was flipped. The rug covering the bloodstained floor was torn up. Everything was in disarray as I looked for anything- absolutely anything that would’ve had my name on it. As I tore the closet apart, I found my old name tag. At the time, it and everything else definitely said:

“Hello! My name is Andy.”

I haven’t stopped crying for weeks. I just. I don’t know. I don’t know what this means. I’m spiraling. The snow is coming down again; that stain is still on the floor; and the typewriter is gone, along with the manuscript for A Snow Day.

I’m starting to think that he wasn’t an intruder at all. I’m starting to think that I fed him to his dogs.
