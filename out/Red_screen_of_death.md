Hey guys I know this isn't the usual forum for tech support but I'm having a really weird issue and it's getting me kinda worried. A fried on discord sent me a link to what he said is his blog, so I opened it and then my PC crashed in a way I've never seen or even heard of before. I'm in quite a few tech savvy circles and have been around the block myself, but every single person I've asked thought I was talking nonsense or that I'm trolling or telling a story. It's extremely frustrating, and this is my 12th attempt to try and get some clarity about this.

I wish I could of taken a picture of this, but my phone was dead. See, it looked like an older Windows BSOD, but with a red background. But where a BSOD would have a technical information and stuff like that, this was making out like I personally was about to get hurt. It really rattled me, and I needed a pretty long while to fully calm down after. Still feeling pretty anxious though that something really terrible nearly just happened. Or has happened. Or is about to happen. The text was laid out as follows, best I can remember. 

A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent harm to the user.

The problem would have resulted in severe injury or death of the user.

KILL_AGENT

Just...what? I'm so confused. Is this some kind of weird virus? i asked the guy about it and he nuked his entire online presence a couple minutes later. I asked other mutual friends if they had similar experiences and all that have gotten back to me said they all had this weird crash. And just what the hell is "KILL_AGENT"? is that the name of a virus or some kind of technical jargon? Or did someone actually trying to freaking kill me and my computer has a built in mechanism to protect me from it? 

I'm starting to think I do need to see a doctor because I feel like I'm going mad. Wouldn't something as serious as this have some kind of documentation associated with it? Any kind of resource, or help article or anything that would explain this.

It just seems kinda sinister, so I'm looking for expert help here. Do I need to do anything? Should I tell the police about this? It hasn't happened again thankfully, I just hope that nobody was actually hurt. I'd be happier if this was some sort of elaborate ruse or prank but I get the feeling that it's not. I've also searched every search engine for this but have come up empty handed. Is there any guidance on this? I'm really freaked out.
