The first time I noticed her, I was at my local grocery store. I don’t live in a small town or anything, so seeing a new face was the norm. I could hardly point out one of the cashiers if put in a lineup…but something about her made me study her, like I wanted to remember her.

She was short, maybe only 5’4”, but was clearly very athletic, maybe a runner? Her toned slim body was in stark contrast to her gaunt tired face, mouth just so slightly open, and short shoulder length hair matted with…being generous, hopefully sweat.

Anyone would think she was just homeless, and I would’ve too if not for her outfit, nice bright neon pink tank top and yellow compression shorts. I couldn’t help but stare, wondering what was up with her. She looked so out of place, so…harsh against the other shoppers there, doing their best to avoid her, steering carts in wide circles as if she was radioactive. 

Snapping out of my stare, I joined the others going around her as well, not giving such a wide berth, but still not getting close. I really should’ve followed their example though, maybe she wouldn’t have realized.

As I passed I could finally see her eyes, wide and focused, alert and intelligent, out of place on her sad deteriorating face. It was like someone mashed four people together and the result inheriting all the strangest traits.

I got to another aisle and just continued my shopping as normal. I almost forgot about her, up until I was checking out. 

She was in the same place, a few steps from automatic doors, whooshing behind her. It only now began to creep up on me, some unknown dread. Why hadn’t she left? What was she doing just standing there? 

I’m no good Samaritan or anything, under normal circumstances I just would’ve left, and I should’ve. I should’ve stuck to my gut but no…I had to open my big mouth.

Once I’d checked out I walked over to the the customer service desk and told the employee about the woman. The middle aged woman behind the counter leaned over it to confirm where I was pointing, and assured me they’d take care of it. My duty as a concerned citizen done, I pushed my cart to the exit, hearing the employee behind me come around from the desk a few steps behind. As I left I spared one more passing glance at the her, the woman, and stopped in my tracks. 

Her head was now turned. Her body hadn’t moved an inch, but she was now facing forward with her head almost looking over her shoulder to the left, right where I’d been talking to the store employee. I wouldn’t have stopped for that though, of course not. No, I stopped because of her eye.

Her right eye was still staring ahead, as if it was fixed in position, her left eye had no such trouble. It was completely turned, the eye itself *bulging* from the socket just to turn ever so slightly more, just to look at me. The intensity of the gaze had tripled and my stomach roiled from the sight-

The store employees' shrill voice broke our now shared stare, and I nearly sprinted out to my car. I shoved my things into the backseat without worry or care, just pushing the cart away from me so I could get out of the parking lot as soon as possible.

I just had to open my big mouth.
