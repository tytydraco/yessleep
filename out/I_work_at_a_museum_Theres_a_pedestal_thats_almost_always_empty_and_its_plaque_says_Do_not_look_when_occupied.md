I've posted here[ before](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n3ekid/i_work_at_a_museum_theres_a_pedestal_thats_always/). This job I got from the dark web asked me to watch over a rather strange exhibition. I feel I'm not alone, but the pay is well, and my first day here didn't raise enough questions for me to quit.

The next days after my first contact with whatever was there went on peacefully. I mean, as peacefully as they could. You know what happens when the seed of fear is planted into someone's mind - they start to notice things and automatically shape them out as weird. Any temperature shift or any groaning of the wood nourished that seed already nailed into my brain like a parasite. My eyes would dart to random corners of the rooms, impatient and ready for something, *anything* to pop out of frame and scare me. I felt swallowed by the huge warehouse, unable to see exactly what was digesting me. 

Someone said on this forum that I should check if the exhibition was advertised online in any way. However, I didn't know what name to search up. The offer and the lady had only referred to it as a prestigious temporary exhibition, and nothing more. On my fifth day, I decided to start looking up the exhibits. I was sitting at my desk, my back stiff from hours of doing nothing, and I loaded up the browsed to type "the painter exhibit do not look when occupied".

I waited anxiously for the results to be generated. Some forum entry briefly mentioning that they were looking for someone with connections in the art curator world (I assumed not the usual art curating), because they had a potentially new exhibit that could cost a lot of money. Some blog about soul trapping, but I didn't really understand the connection. A few pictures with an empty pedestal that I skimmed through. I don't know why, but those were the most disturbing part.

After day eight, temptation dripped down from where it was trapped in my mind to my heart. I looked up to the paintings - there was something I had missed before. I could feel it. I don't know how I knew, but I did.

I got up and walked to *My mother.* The sea landscape that had shown me nothing when I first looked. 

I stared at it for as much as I could. Just me and the painting in the empty warehouse.

The more I stared, the more I realized that the painting seemed to be moving. I know that must have been a trick of the mind, something invented by my bored brain, and yet... something really did move. It was shaking a little, a flicker of light into the darkened sky awaiting the storm. It was there, and terribly real.

I leaned in a little closer, and suddenly the flicker disappeared, but something in the painting *leaned in, too*.

As if to also have a closer look. 

I jumped back. I didn't understand what I had seen, it was impossible to describe. The thing jumped back, too. I stared in sheer confusion, until relief and embarrassment washed over me. The fucking painting had protective glass over it. I'd seen my own fucking reflection in the waves...

But, you know, as all good things, the relief ended when I remembered the flicker I'd seen. It was back now, and right next to my reflection. I could make out a woman's face, behind me.

It was as if my body had been physically hit. I flinched and looked back, greeted by nothing. I took a step to the side, staring at the next painting of a dense forest, titled *My father.* Only, I was looking at the reflection of an elderly man next to mine.

How could that be possible? The title wasn't of what was painted, but of what the glass *reflected.* I took half a step to the side, reading the title of the next painting in the corner of my eye. 

*The Sleeper in the Corner*

I moved in front of it and looked at the painting, concentrating on the glass. In the corner of the room, right where my desk was, I could make out the reflection of someone crouched over. "What the fuck?" I said out loud, turning my head so quick that my neck hurt. No one was there. Bullshit. No one *I could see* was there.

With the corner of my eye, I read the next title.

*The Open Mouth*

My blood ran cold. My heart was pounding uncontrollably in my chest, making me dizzy, either sending too much blood or not enough. I gasped and slowly stepped towards the desk, in the spot where I'd seen the reflection. I didn't bump into anyone invisible. If I looked at the painting again, would it be titled differently? For fuck's sake.

Right then, the entrance door opened. I almost shat myself at the sudden noise. The lady from the first day stepped in. "Hi. I just wanted to check on you, see if things are going well."

"Uh, yeah. I mean, there's definitely weird stuff happening. Kind of an eccentric exhibition you got going on here."

"I don't own it."

She walked all the way to the back, slowly, taking her time to inspect each of the exhibits. When she came back, she didn't even seem surprised to see that the stack of tickets hadn't gotten smaller. I realized I'd left the tab of the pictures of empty pedestals on my laptop, and I turned it so it wouldn't face her.

"Good job. You're doing well," she muttered. "One thing, though. Sometimes it'll try to trick you."

"Who?"

"To look at the pedestal. Just be careful. Again, we appreciate your discretion."

"Right." 

She left without saying goodbye. I sighed and turned the laptop back to me. I stared at the picture of the empty pedestal. It looked just like the one in the warehouse. I saw my reflection on the monitor, and then... I saw another flicker of a reflection, that turned into a silhouette. I watched it glide across the laptop screen right where the empty pedestal was, then I watched it lean over. Now, the pedestal looked like it was occupied. I stared at it for a few seconds, before realizing what had happened. I quickly slammed the laptop shut and looked behind me. Fuck. That didn't count, right? That didn't count.

I clocked out earlier that day. I hoped they didn't mind.

That didn't count, right?
