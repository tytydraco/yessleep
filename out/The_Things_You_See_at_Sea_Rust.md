Everyone who works at sea knows there are some things you just don't talk about with shore people. Like the magic pipe, or where the extra money came from for the crew welfare fund after passing through the Suez Canal, or just quite how close you came to crushing that little wooden fishing boat off the coast of Vietnam. Things they wouldn't get, that would tarnish the image of the gentleman captain and his well oiled crew; standing to attention in their crisp white shirts and shiny golden threaded epaulettes. But beyond that, deeper than things they wouldn't understand are things they shouldn't understand. Things that people who haven't spent time out there, thousands of miles from civilization, where the lines between reality and what lies beyond get thin, and blurry, and sometimes vanish altogether should never know. Things that would make your skin crawl and the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Things that would leave the average landsman barely clinging onto the edge of sanity by the thinnest of margins. Things I'm going to share with you.

What you need to understand, before I begin in earnest, is that so far out at sea things get…fuzzy. My pet theory is that the collective consciousness of humanity gets thin out there, so far from everyone else. The barrier of logic and faith and the knowledge of what is and can be and what isn't and can't simply doesn't extend so far out as to cover the open ocean, days or weeks from anywhere that could even generously be described as inhabited. Other sailors have their own theories, ghosts and aliens and ancient slumbering gods. All at least somewhat true but I don't think any of us quite have everything right. I don't think any of us could get everything right, at least not without slipping too far beyond rationality to ever come back. Some just accept it for what it is and give it no thought whatsoever, I envy them. But what's important is the fuzziness of it all. The moment that reality crosses into unreality is rarely noticeable until you're already knee deep in impossibility.

So that's the context. That's what you need to understand for you to truly comprehend the things I've seen, and heard, and felt, and become. This is your last chance to back out. If you're still reading, I would commend your bravery if I weren't so certain it was ignorance rather than courage that propelled you.

My first experience with that slow fade into what lies beyond rational thought is the one that sticks with me the most. That's the way for most seamen I've spoken to, you never forget the moment you realise you've crossed the line into unreality, the feeling of something in your mind warping as all the logic you've built your life on twists to the point it snaps, and you accept the impossible to be true.

If there is one thing that defines a life working at sea it's rust. It drives almost every action you take when working on deck. Finding rust, removing rust, preventing rust. Chipping and painting: the deck cadet's bread and butter.

The process is actually a rather satisfying one. When I first started as a cadet it was almost therapeutic. You start out with a jet chisel, a collection of long blunt ended needles connected to a handle, powered by pressurised air. When you squeeze the trigger the needles fire back and forth at high speed, shattering the paintwork below them in a satisfying burst, revealing the corrosion underneath. It appears quite violent at first but in actuality the needles aren't moving fast enough to cause you any harm. That's the key you see, where the metal has rusted the paint layered above it loses adhesion, and weakens. The force required to break it is minimal, which means the chisel itself doesn't need much power. It's how you know you've reached the edge of a patch of rust: the metal beneath begins to turn from a tarnished black to a more reflective silver, and the paint becomes much harder to remove.

From there comes the wire brushing. Removing the rust and sanding down the edges of the remaining paint using a high speed rotating brush, with bristles made of coarse steel. Not quite as satisfying as the chipping, but arguably more important. What's the point in knowing where the rust is if you just let it spread? Whilst this looks less violent than the process of chipping it's actually far more likely to cause you harm than using a jet chisel ever would. The wire bristles are likely to fly off at speed, and I've lost count of the amount of times I've almost had one embed itself into my throat, stopped only by the neck gaiter I wear for exactly these situations. And of course that's assuming you don't need to use Metalbrite. A horrific corrosive concoction with the stench of synthetic chemicals that burns at your nose hairs and sticks in the back of your throat. Truly awful stuff, but fantastic at removing rust; within minutes it can have even the most stubborn patches looking almost new, but god help you if you got any of it on your hands. But hey, that's why we wear PPE. Boiler suits, gloves, goggles, dust masks. All designed to keep us safe from errant bristles, corrosive chemicals and lungfuls of iron oxide as it's stripped from the metal it once called home.

There was something so satisfying about revealing a large patch of rust, starting from the centre and following it as it grew, reaching out to spread further and further throughout the steel until you find its maximum extent. It was strangely beautiful to see the different shades and colours in a particularly big section. The blacks and browns of old long rusted portions, pockmarked with the vibrant, almost unnatural orange of fresh spots where the rust had only just begun to take hold. It always fascinated me, the way it would spread. It was almost like a living organism, a parasite, but instead of feeding on its host it incorporated it into itself. Taking the iron from within the steel structure and converting it into Iron Oxide. Millimeter by millimeter, each atom converted becoming another vector from which it can transmit.

Occasionally I would find a spot underneath the paint that looked as though it had bubbled up from within. These spots were so soft you could fracture the paint simply by pressing it with you finger, the paint slowly giving way beneath the pressure before suddenly collapsing with a satisfying snapping feeling beneath your finger tip. And once the paint broke the cause of the bubble became clear, as the salt water trapped beneath the paint trickled out through the cracks, leaving behind a trail of orange-brown streaks as it went.

That's how my first two months at sea went. For four hours every morning, nothing but chipping alongside the deck ratings. Ratings are really the ones who keep the ship running. Officers may know how the Gas Combustion Unit functions or be able to tell you every rule under the Collision Avoidance Regulations, but if you need anything fixed, replaced, painted or polished, the ratings are who you go to. And that's who I spent my first month with. When I wasn't on the bridge learning how to keep watch with the Chief Officer, a stern Scottish man who had a look in his eye that he was always expecting trouble to bubble up out of nowhere, I was with the deck guys chipping away at the rust.

I usually worked with an AB called Max. He was a fair bit older than me, mid forties I'd have guessed but I never bothered to ask. He'd served for years as an Able Bodied Seaman in the company, and absolutely adored his job. We'd often talk about why we'd come to sea, and what we'd done before making the leap, and he'd say "Matt, every day here is an adventure. You'll see things you never even dreamed of. Just stick with me and I'll see you through!" And so I did. For the first two months everything Max did, I did. Admittedly most of that was limited to chipping and wire brushing but he kept me right.

We were sailing back to the Suez Canal from the West Coast of India when Max took ill. He'd forgotten to roll down his sleeves when brushing down a particularly stubborn patch of rust on the underside of a mooring winch and taken a needle to the arm. It hadn't been enough to stop him at the time, barely even breaking the skin, but when he complained of an itching sensation the Chief Mate told him to take some rash cream from the medical locker and take the day off.

The day he returned to work, Max initially seemed fine, working as usual, but he seemed almost hesitant to use the wire brush. It seemed a natural enough reaction at first glance, worrying about the accident, it could potentially have been far worse than a scratch to the arm if he'd been unlucky so of course he'd want to take his time. And that's what all the guys assumed. "Oh Max is just being overly careful, he'll get over it" I heard one of them, a man named Frederico say to the other guys over coffee. But I had spent the whole morning with him and it seemed more than that. He still scratched ferociously at his forearm where he'd been struck by the needle when he thought no one was looking, and recoiled visibly from the sound of a wire brush whirring. But he still worked fine, and otherwise seems his normal self, so I chalked it up to fright from the accident and left him to it.

Cadets tend to get weekends off whilst at sea, and I didn't see much of Max until Monday. Usually he could be found after work watching a film in the crew lounge or playing basketball out on the poop deck, but that weekend I only caught glimpses of him heading to or from his cabin, which struck me as odd. I asked him about it when I saw him on the Monday morning but he just said something about feeling tired and not being able to get much sleep. And from the looks of him he really had struggled to get some rest in. His eyes were bloodshot with deep bags beneath them and, although he tried to hide it, his forearm was red raw where he had been scratching at it. I tried to tell him to talk to Chief about it, maybe get some stronger medicine from the locker, but he just said he was fine and he didn't want to make a fuss.

That day I noticed Max becoming even more hesitant with the wire-brush, and at one point I saw him physically recoil as I pressed the brush against the steel and sent the rust flying into the air. It was a particularly advanced case, on the strong point of the ship's railings designed to lash lifeboat to in an emergency. The brush wasn't quite doing the job so I asked Max to grab me a bucket full of Metalbrite, but instead of going to fill one up he looked at me with a sad, almost pained expression.

“Can't you hear it?” he asked, turning to face me. Confused, I took a step back and asked him what he meant. 
“The rust” he replied stepping towards me “It sings so beautifully if you know how to listen.” At this point I began to worry, I thought maybe the needle had given him and infection and he'd begun to become delirious so I ran to get the Chief officer to make sure he was okay, since he was the closest thing to a doctor we had onboard. By the time we got back Max was working away as though nothing happened, and when I tried to explain to the Chief what had happened he just told me he'd keep an eye on him, and to take the rest of the morning off.

That night as I was trying to sleep I woke to a familiar sound. The metallic rattle of chipping needles firing into a bulkhead. Initially I shot upright, sure I'd overslept, but my clock read 3am, and it was still dark out. Confused, I began throwing on a boiler suit to head put onto deck and see what was happening. I wasn't going to be able to sleep with the noise and I was confused as to why anyone would be on deck so early. Stopping to grab a torch from the rack in the cargo control room, I walked into the deck slowly, not wanting to trip on the myriad of compressed air nozzles and hydrants that dotted the area, until I saw the source of the noise. 

Hunched in the darkness, a chipping gun in hand, was Max. I couldn't quite see what he was working on from where I was stood but as I shone the light over his back the rattling stopped. “Matt, is that you?” he asked, barely shifting from where he was squatting on the deck. “I knew you'd come, I knew you could hear it too”. Confused, I asked him what he was talking about, mentally trying to work out how I'd be able to get him inside and down to the sick bay. He slowly rose from his position hunched over himself as he replied “The rust of course. It sings of such beautiful corruption. It wants to connect us, to grow with us. Tell me you can hear it Matt”.

Before I could formulate a response he turned towards me and my breath caught in my throat. I can't put into words the thoughts that ran through my head when I saw him. Every emotion I had ever felt in my life was dwarfed in that moment by sheer unadulterated terror. The skin on the right side of his face was cracked and peeling, revealing a dull brown stain spreading across the blackened flesh beneath, pocked with a network of virulent orange spots like veins across the surface. His right eye was missing completely, the empty socket oozing saltwater, leaving brown streaks down what little remained of his skin on that side of his face, staining the pristine white of his boiler suit.

I staggered back, tripping on a compressed air hookup and landing on my back, knocking the wind out of me. I tried to scramble backwards as he approached me but to no avail. He leaned over me, the salt water soaking into my boiler suit as he reached down to grab me by the collar. Panicked, I attempted to loosen his grip, but my hand recoiled as I grasped his arm and felt the familiar sensation of paint crumbling beneath my touch as salt water begin to leak from underneath the skin where I had grabbed him. “Don't worry Matt. I'll teach you how to hear it. You can be just like me”

He raised me up from the deck and held me aloft by the front of my boiler suit, part of his lips flaking off and falling to the deck below, revealing pristine white teeth in stark contrast to the decay continuing to spread its way across his face. I wish I could say I saved myself, that with a flash of genius and some heroic surge of strength I managed to escape, but I didn't. Fortunately the chief mate did. He'dbeen observing Max for some time from the bridge, when he saw me on deck. He swung a prybar at the back of Max's head, connecting at the base of the skull with a metallic clash, the vibrations of which I could feel as it reverberated through his body into his hands. A second swing and he had dropped me, a third and he was on his knees, but the Chief didn't stop swinging. Blow after blow came down from overhead until the back of Max's skull was dented inwards, as if his head had been deflated from the inside.

“Get the Metalbrite” he said once he was sure Max was still. “I'll tell the captain we need to call in a man overboard” I hesitated, a fairly natural response I'd argue, but chief was adamant that there was no time to waste and so I ran down to the chemical store and came up with two full jugs. I never heard the rust sing, but I'll never forget the way it screamed as we poured the metalbrite over what used to be Max. A cacophony of metallic grating and screeching, completely artificial yet somehow the agony was palpable regardless. Agony, and sorrow. In that moment I understood the pain the rust was feeling, the pain of being presented with a feast the size of a super tanker but denied at every turn, of being reviled simply for existing where it had no choice but to. I almost felt pity as I set down the first emlty jug, until I remembered the iron grip on my shirt, and the man I called a mentor. At that I opened the second and emptied it out too.

From there, I was debriefed by the chief mate and the captain. Max was to be declared an overnight man overboard, with no chance of rescue, and the scope of what I had signed up for finally revealed to me. The smarter part of me wanted to quit, I was so close to leaving and never coming back, but something in me wanted to stay. I tell people it was the money, or the chance to see the world. But honestly looking back, the morbid part of me wanted to know more about what went on so far out to sea, where humans have no business being. Unfortunately that desire has been indulged many times since, but I'll leave it there as this has already gotten longer than I intended, and retelling this has got me breaking out in itches. Luckily we just stocked back up on metalbrite.
