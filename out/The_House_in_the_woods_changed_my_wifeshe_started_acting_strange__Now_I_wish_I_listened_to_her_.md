I don’t know where to start. Maybe three months ago. Maybe before that. It’s hard to tell when things really started going wrong, when my life turned completely upside down.

I had everything. A job I liked, friends, and most importantly, my wife. We had been together for four years before getting married five months ago. I was happy—truly happy. We had been saving for a home, and when we finally found one, it felt like destiny. It was an old house in the middle of the woods, massive and secluded, far away from the city. A fresh start.

I remember the first night in that house. We had just finished unpacking, exhausted but excited. We sat on the porch, looking out into the endless blackness of the trees, drinking cheap wine straight from the bottle. She leaned against me, warm and safe.

"I love this," she whispered.

"So do I."

We thought we were the luckiest people in the world. But that feeling didn’t last.

It started with the animals.

The first one was a raccoon, sprawled lifelessly on the porch one morning. At first, I assumed it had been killed by some predator, but there was something… off about it. Its body wasn’t torn or bloodied. Its limbs were stiff, its mouth frozen in a silent scream.

The next morning, it was a rabbit. Then a chicken.

Every few days, another one appeared, always arranged unnaturally—sometimes right in the center of the yard, sometimes at our doorstep. Once, I found a fox hanging from a low tree branch by its hind legs, its throat slit cleanly.

I set up cameras, but the footage never showed anything. The animals just… appeared.

My wife started acting strange soon after.

At first, it was little things—zoning out in the middle of conversations, staring at something just over my shoulder. She kept misplacing things.

"I swear I left my phone on the table," she’d murmur, checking the same place over and over, growing more frustrated each time.

I would find it in the freezer, in the bathroom sink, in the yard. I joked that she was becoming forgetful, but she didn’t laugh.

"Something isn’t right here," she said one night, eyes darting toward the darkened hallway. "I keep hearing things. When I’m alone, it sounds like someone’s whispering my name."

I tried to reassure her, but deep down, I was starting to feel it too. The house was never silent. At night, I would hear faint scuttling sounds in the walls, like something crawling just out of sight. Other times, it was a soft tapping noise, rhythmic and deliberate, always coming from the closet in our bedroom.

One night, I woke up to find my wife sitting on the edge of the bed, her hands gripping the sheets tightly.

"Do you hear it?" she whispered.

I strained my ears. Nothing.

She turned to me, her face pale. "It’s in the walls."

The night I found her in the bathtub is the night I stopped pretending things were normal.

I had come home late, exhausted, expecting to find her asleep. But as I walked past the bathroom, I noticed the door was slightly open.

Inside, the tub was full of water. And red.

For a second, my mind refused to process what I was seeing. Then I saw her, slumped against the side, her arms floating limply.

I screamed, yanking her out of the tub, pressing towels against her wrists. Her skin was ice cold, her lips trembling.

"I can’t do this," she sobbed. "They won’t let me."

"Who?" I demanded.

She just shook her head. "They whisper when the lights go out."

I stayed awake all night, watching over her.

The next morning, I took her to a doctor. They said it was stress, maybe a depressive episode brought on by the move. They prescribed medication.

It didn’t help.

She barely slept. I would wake up to find her standing by the window, staring out into the woods. Her lips would move silently, like she was talking to someone.

Sometimes, she would wake up screaming. Clawing at her own arms, her face contorted in terror.

"They’re touching me," she sobbed.

"There’s nothing there," I whispered, holding her close. "Nothing is touching you."

But I wasn’t sure I believed that anymore.

A False Hope

Then, miraculously, things got better.

She got pregnant. And for a little while, the house felt warm again. She was glowing, full of life. The whispers stopped. The tapping in the walls faded. I started to believe that maybe—just maybe—we had been imagining everything.

Our daughter was born on a cold November morning. She was perfect. We named her Lillian.

For the next few months, we were happy. My parents visited, and we had a wonderful time. The house felt normal again.

Then, the dead animals came back.

And my wife started to slip.

She wouldn’t let anyone else hold Lillian, clutching her tightly, her eyes darting nervously around the room.

"They want her," she whispered one night. "They want to take her."

I didn’t know what to do. I took her to more doctors, but none of them had answers. They didn’t see the things I saw—the scratches appearing on the walls overnight, the distorted voices coming through the baby monitor.

I started waking up with bruises I couldn’t explain.

One night, I woke to the sound of static from the monitor. Then, a voice.

"She’s beautiful."

I ran to the nursery. The crib was empty.

My wife was standing in the corner, clutching Lillian to her chest, rocking her back and forth.

"They said she’s ready," she murmured.

That was the night I planned to take her away. I didn’t care if she fought me. I was getting my daughter out of that house.

But I was too late.

The Call

The next morning, I got a call from the police.

My wife and daughter were dead.

They wouldn’t tell me what happened at first. When they did, I wished they hadn’t.

They found my wife in the woods behind the house. Sitting against a tree. Her eyes… gone. Hollow sockets staring into nothing. She was holding Lillian in her arms, cradling her gently, like she was still alive.

My daughter’s body was untouched.

The funeral was a blur. I don’t remember speaking to anyone. I just remember standing there, staring at the ground, my hands numb.

I couldn’t stay in that house. I left, went back to my parents. I didn’t know what else to do.

That’s when I found the book.

It was hidden in my mother’s closet, wrapped in cloth.

I opened it.

And I read my wife’s words.

Page after page, describing everything—the whispers, the shadows, the dead animals.

And then, the last page.

An illustration. A man sitting against a tree, eyes hollow, cradling something in his arms.

Exactly how they had found her.

My breath caught in my throat. The air around me grew colder.

Then, behind me, I heard my mother’s voice.

She called my name.

Slowly, I turned.

She was smiling.

But her mouth was too wide.

And her eyes were wrong.

Something is here.

Something has always been here.
