  
EDIT - I can see this post is being shared but not interacted with in any way, could someone explain this? 


I'm thinking of buying one of them E-Bikes, apparently *isn't* the right response when your friend that you see quarterly when he's back in town, is telling you about the criminal amount of insurance he's paying as a new driver.  What the fuck do I know right? It happens slowly, your friend's outgrowing you financially. I salute them, they did the right things after all. Although I have a sneaking suspicion that somewhere along the line they were let into some secret fast track that wasn't afforded to me.



I am, though, thinking of buying one. Did you want to hear more about my conversation with him? I was going to skip it, you'd think those fleeting visits would atleast give you a lot to talk about, but it's sort of like when Joe Rogan has the same specialist on twice, you end up talking about the same shit. I mean I actually catch myself queueing up the same exact dialogue as three visits ago, and it goes down as easily as the first time I said it. The point is that ground isn't worth covering.



I could make it work with a payment plan. I'm talking about the E-Bike thing again now. £200 a month for four months. I could make that work. I work nights is the thing, that's why I need it. I've been walking home at 4 in the morning if you can believe that. Feels like I'm tempting fate RE: Random stabbings. 45 Minutes of pure terror if I'm being honest. An e-bike would get me there in 10. It's a no-brainer. 



So anyway, I figured it'd be a good idea to try one of them out, find out if they're the real deal. They've got those Rental ones that you unlock with an app. I'm at work tomorrow, and I'm planning to go to my girlfriend's place after, so I figure that's a great opportunity to take one for a test ride. Maps is telling me 50 minutes, but that's an estimate for a regular old bike, right? Not a crazy e-lectronic bike that's for sure. 



So, I did it. I feel like before anything else I should preface that I'm a fucking idiot, because that's workable, we can examine that. Everything else I don't know. Does every young guy come with a built-in invincibility complex? That's what I want to know- And I don't mean I'm walking around thinking I can take on anything, I mean the same kind of invincibility complex a rabbit must have when it runs out into an open field thinking that's such a great idea. 



I ended up taking the ride, is what I'm saying. Didn't tell anyone at work, my girlfriend was expecting me, but I hadn't mentioned my method of transport. Just clocked out and unlocked the thing with my phone, and set off. It seems stupid now to say this when I'm obviously setting up that something obviously happened out there, but the whole thing seemed quite fun to me at that point.



How wrong I was.



I mean, first of all, let me just say that the bike was great, it's insane for me to be talking about the bike but, it really was cool. Forgive me, that's the only thing I can grasp onto here. It works with you essentially, you start it off pedalling as normal, and then it kicks in and says ‘Oh, pedalling were you? Let me go ahead and take care of about 80% of that action for you’



So it all started off fine, I put my earphones in to let the map lady guide me by voice. I work in the city centre, and I've only ever travelled to my girlfriend's place by train or Uber, so it wasn't a journey I was familiar with. I rode past people coming out of nightclubs, cheerfully thinking of all the usual semi-hostile interactions with guys that didn't get laid that night, that I was now skipping entirely by virtue of my super-fast e-lectronic bike. 



Eventually, I start getting out of the main part of town, I'm following the map lady's instructions fine, and then it happened. ‘In 100 yards take a left, then hard right’ And I realise what it is that hadn't occurred to me as I approached, it's gonna send me down the canal. You fucking idiot I think, of course it was gonna do that, what did you think you were gonna ride down the friggin motorway? 



So with no other choice, I rode the ramp down to the canal path, both hands twitching over the brakes, slowed to a complete crawl. And then, it was pitch black, nothing lighting my path in front of me except a solitary, blinking headlight on the bike's front. And so now I start with the dum-dee-dums and the idle talking to myself, ‘You’re fine, you're cool, you're *Captain* Cool’ all that stupid stuff you do when you're scared and out of your depth. 



I continue onwards, straining my eyes for oncoming danger, thinking about how narrow this god damn path is. I'm craning my neck at every underpass, pretty conscious of the water too, cold and black and deep. Thinking if I missed one of those metal things you tie rope around in the path in front of me, I'd be over the handlebars and straight in there. I must've been on the path for about five minutes when I started to settle into a decent rhythm i.e still scared but okay enough. 



And then, as I'm straining my eyes out in front of me, in the distance I spot a figure. Crept down by the underpass. I slow down a little, weighing my options. Who would be down here right now? I mean, other than me, Homeless maybe? Some kind of Delinquent? I didn’t get a chance to find out, because immediately I think; Fuck that! And I take the ramp back up onto the street just before I get to the underpass.



Map lady protests, but it's not like she's actually in charge or anything. Trouble is, I start looking around and realise that I don’t really know where the hell I am, no houses, no people. Turns out I’d wandered onto some kind of industrial estate, of the waste management variety. And so I continue on down the road, aware that the direction I’m going in isn’t getting me any closer to my destination, I’m riding around aimlessly, looking at huge lorries delivering titanic oceans of refuse into industrial plants, I figured it was kind of interesting, to see where all of your shit actually goes. The street ahead of me begins to be lit up by the warm glow of an incinerator, and for a moment, I think that the whole thing is pretty atmospheric and that I don’t mind having made the detour.



Eventually I find my way out of this industrial complex and onto a road that’s a little more public and I figured I should probably work things out with Map Lady again, so I start the Journey over from my current location, this starts off fine and I’m riding through residential areas, along the way I spot a Train station that I recognised from when I take the Train over to her and I’m relieved to know I’m somewhat in the right direction, although only about a quarter of the way there. So I’m riding along and feeling pretty okay about the way things were shaking out. And then the same direction comes through ‘In 100 yards take a left, then hard right’ God damn it, there’s an ‘avoid motorways’ button for cars why can’t I get an ‘avoid canals’ button. I figure I can’t keep looking around, it’ll be midday by the time I get there at the pace I’m going.



I look down into a pitch black abyss, swallow hard, and take the ramp down again, to the canal. 



When I get down to the canal properly I receive what seems to the last direction for some time ‘Continue straight for 2 and a half miles’ and then it’s dead silence and I’m thinking ‘Damn it lady, would it kill you to make a little small talk?’ Suddenly, I’m wishing she were more of an all-encompassing digital assistant. I realise how stupid I must look, hair on the back of my neck, elbows locked into place, white knuckles grasping the handlebars with a stupid, terrified expression on my face.



I’m 5 minutes into this 2 and a half mile stretch and at this point the urban hum has dissipated entirely, replaced by quiet echoes, distant dripping and strange gurgling sounds. I hear a splash that might’ve been caused by the tires whipping up a twig or a rock and sending it into the water, but it spooks me nonetheless. It seems counterintuitive and dumb to make myself *less* aware of my surroundings, but I reach up and tap my in-ear headphones, activating the noise cancellation. The intended pacifying effect somewhat muted by the creepy ass ‘SHH’ sound effect they play as they plunge you into a deep quiet. I start wondering just how long 2 and half miles is anyway, how long I’m gonna have to keep up being right along the razor edge of keeping it together and utter fucking petrification.



I start thinking about her, and how dumb I am for getting myself into this situation. I’m not an overly romantic guy, but whenever I get myself into any kind of trouble, I always imagine her at the end of it all, ready to patch me up. Which is stupid because she’s not particularly caring, and I don’t particularly like her. But it helps. I think about her warm bed waiting for me, and how I’ll probably be able to make her laugh at how stupid I was. Yeah, that’s what I’m doing, I think, gathering material for a funny story to tell my girlfriend. 



I see a sign up ahead in big letters, ‘PATH NARROWS AHEAD’ Great, I think, that’s just what I need. They weren’t kidding either, that path did narrow, apparently the result of some kind of construction going on. Eventually, the path turned from a path into some temporary boarding with its own on-ramp, ‘CYCLISTS DISMOUNT’ A sign before it says. Not wanting to fall foul of a remote sign in an area supervised by absolutely no one, I do just that. I walk with the bike along this boarding for about two minutes before it turns back into regular canal path, and then after some time I come up across a chain linked face and a final, more definitive sign ‘DANGER: DEMOLITIONS AHEAD’ ‘Jesus Christ’ I think, this whole thing has turned from Ill-advised into an outright farce. 



I guess the concerned party that placed the sign thought it’s warning would suffice, as the gap in the chain-link fence was big enough to fit myself, and the bike through. You’ve got to understand that at this point I was quite a ways down the canal path, turning back would mean I’d have to go back through all of that terror, it would leave me with no way to get to where I was going, all the while the timer on my rental app would be ticking up into a fortune, with nothing to show for it. I had to continue. I figure I should have wits about me though, and so I turn the noise cancellation off on my earphones. I pushed the bike through ahead of me, and then slid through myself. 



I figured out what the construction was for then, There were these concrete pillars, wide as trucks and rising out of the ground, like towering monuments, disconnected from anything else. It’s part of the new high-speed rail line they’ve been working on for what feels like a decade now.



It’s funny. I remember when they announced it, they called it a “vital artery” for the future of the region. A *lifeline*. Looking around now, in the middle of the night with no one here, the whole thing looks less like a lifeline and more like a half-built tomb.



The pillars get closer together as I push the bike further in, like they’re trying to herd me into something. There's fencing everywhere, torn plastic sheeting flapping around in the wind, and piles of reinforced steel. It’s empty, no vehicles moving. I keep expecting, or maybe hoping some hard-hat in a high-vis jacket will call out to me, insult me for being such an idiot wandering onto an active construction site and then kindly direct me to the nearest and most convenient exit, maybe during this he’ll have softened up and we’ll have a joke about what a comedy of errors my whole journey had been. But this imaginary interchange is put to a stop when I hear it.

Low, metallic *clunk*.

Far off at first. It could be a crane shifting its weight. Then again. *Clunk.* Like hydraulics, exhaling. And then nothing. I stop walking. Try to locate it. Can’t. The sound's bouncing off everything, the pillars, the corrugated metal sheets. I keep going, pushing the bike in front of me. Every so often I pass a yellow hard hat sitting in the dirt, or one of those little foldout stools people use when they're welding. Then I hear it again — *bang* — closer now. Not a machine this time. Not exactly. More like someone dropping something heavy, on purpose.

I freeze.

A laugh rises in my throat, one of those pathetic little “ha!” sounds that come out when you’re trying not to bolt. I start saying things out loud again, this time I’m thinking about how I heard on a podcast that whilst we’ve been scraping around in the dirt, China has managed to build tens of thousands of kilometres of high-speed railway tracks. I start to say ‘China CHIIINA’ In my best Trump impression

At one point, I walk over this big roll of caution tape, I step over it, and my foot catches, for a second, I start to thinking that something has grabbed hold of me. And I realise just how on edge I am when I look down and realise it’s just plastic

The weirdest thing is, I think I start to hear the Map lady faintly through my earphones. Like she’s whispering? Breathing maybe. 

Eventually, the noise fades behind me, and I come out on the other side of the site — or at least what I *think* is the other side. The canal picks up again, narrow and dark.

And there she is again: *“Continue straight.”*

Said like it’s the easiest thing in the world.

And this time it sounded off, not robotic anymore. It sounded like the Map lady was… considering her words, watching how I’d react. 

This stretch of canal seemed to have taken on a different, even more unsettling character. The path was even narrower then, and the water looked wrong. Not just dark but completely still. Like it had been paused, the surface didn’t ripple with the breeze any longer, it was like a sheet. Too smooth. Come to think of it, it was like everything had been paused, every creak of the chain and whirr of the motor sounding louder than it should in the new, total silence.

Just then, a new direction comes through ‘Sharp right’. I look to my right and into the black water ‘Are you sure about that one?’ I say out loud, laughing to myself as I consider the potential homicidal intentions of the map lady now directing me into the canal. And then the next direction comes to me and removes all humour from the situation. ‘In a quarter of a mile, consider all decisions you made that brought you to this point, and take responsibility for them’ 

I slam the brakes, my head jerking back like it’s on a string. ‘Did I just hear that?’ I stand there unmoving. I look forward. The headlight blinks and picks out the underpass ahead of me, and I strain my eyes trying to see within it. I hear a splash, then another. Not close, but moving towards me. ‘Continue for 100 yards and try to remember what you told your mother in France?’ I figure that the only way out is through, and so I keep pedalling, trying to ignore that last part, not that it suddenly struck me with some kind of major significance. There isn’t some easily identifiable cosmic moral here. I really didn’t know what the fuck *she* was talking about. The headlight wobbles as my arms shake across the handlebars. The underpass gets closer as I begin to make out what’s ahead of me. I slam on the brakes again when I see several figures crouched down in the darkness. 

Six or seven of them, hunched low like animals. They’re completely still. Not a twitch. The water beside me suddenly ripples — just once. Something deep, shifting below the surface.

My fingers tremble on the brakes. “Okay,” I say out loud. “OKAY!” I shout, trying to sound like some kind of tough guy. I receive my final direction. ‘Your destination is below you’ I freeze. She says it again.

*“Your destination is below you.”*

I back away from the edge of the path, eyes glued to the water now, which looks wrong. Too still. Blacker than it should be, like it’s *holding something underneath*.

Then I hear the bubbles.

Just a few at first. Breaking the surface like something exhaling. And then— It rises. Not fast. Slowly. With weight. Water falls off the thing in sheets. I can’t describe it properly. Bits of scaffolding stick out of it like bones. Concrete clings to it like scales. A *mouth*, I think. I take a step back, and it follows without walking or swimming, it just *moves*, dragging the canal with it like a curtain.

*“Your destination is below you.”*

It says again.

There’s no time. It grabs me, one slick, threaded limb, wrapping around my ankle and yanking me so fast I hit the ground face first. My palms tear open on the gravel. It starts pulling me toward the water. The gravel turns to mud, and I feel myself sliding. And in that moment, I’m done. I give in. I think: *‘*This sort of seems like the kind of thing that would happen to me, actually’ 

But then my hand catches something — a rusted pipe, sticking out of the canal wall. I grab it with everything I’ve got left and wrench myself up. The thing *screams* — not with sound but with pressure, like it’s collapsing in on itself. My legs kick out, boots scraping against the wall. Now I’m up and over the path. I don’t stop to grab the bike. I don’t look back.

I run to the side and find a wall low enough to climb, hoist myself over it, every limb crying out in pain. I land hard and stumble to my feet. I’m on a residential street. Bins out. A car alarm chirping in the distance. One of those little electric scooters dumped on its side by a lamppost. I consider whether my night might have gone differently if I’d taken one of them

I walk the rest of the way to her house. It’s 6 AM when I arrive, I made decent time, all things considered. The next morning, I awoke to a notification on the rental app, a £50 ‘Abandoned bike fee had been applied to my account. I didn’t feel like explaining to customer services what had happened.

 If you were wondering, I did figure out what that whole thing about my mother in France was about, I called her a few days later to ask about it ‘Yeah, I remember all of that trip, you kept insisting every time we went for a swim, that you belonged in the water, that you could grow gills if you’d focus hard enough’ I’m not gonna assign that any more narrative value than it’s worth. I liked to swim, that’s it. A pretty contrived excuse to put me through some Eldritch bullshit if you ask me?

Anyway, I’m taking my own moral away from the whole affair

I *need* to get a fucking vehicle.
