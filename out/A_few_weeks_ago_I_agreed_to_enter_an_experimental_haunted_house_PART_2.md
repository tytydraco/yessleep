Part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oz9hgo/a\_few\_weeks\_ago\_i\_agreed\_to\_enter\_an\_experimental/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oz9hgo/a_few_weeks_ago_i_agreed_to_enter_an_experimental/)

At some point while we were moving up the stairs, a dim red light began saturating the air. But it never got too bright, just enough for us to be able to make out each other’s figures as we moved. I could feel Kijoon tapping on my shoulder from behind. I was about to turn around when he told me not to.

“Keep looking ahead,” he whispered. “Don’t look at it.”

“Look at what?” I whispered back.

“There’s somebody following us.”

“What do you mean?”

“There’s an extra person here.”

I looked up, counted the figures ahead of me. Three.

Everybody was in front of me. The person behind me wasn’t Kijoon. There shouldn’t have been anybody behind me at all.

I could still hear them breathing. I told everyone that we needed to start running.

Nadia didn’t miss a beat and began bolting up the steps while the rest of us trailed close behind her. I’m not sure how long we ran for, but by the time that the stairs ended and gave way to another corridor, my legs had nothing left to give.

We looked back down, waited for something to come charging up at us.

But nothing ever did. So we walked on.

Now it was back to the ceaseless maze of halls. It looked fairly identical to the ones that had come before save for the red glow, which had persisted up from the stairs. I asked Nadia what the red was supposed to mean. She told me she wasn’t sure. That it hadn’t come up in any of the reports she’d gone through. She then told me that there were hardly any similarities between the reports at all. Each experience had been unique. Some mentioned going through rooms the size of auditoriums, while others mentioned having to squeeze through tube-like spaces. There were also accounts of even stranger, more abstract areas. Things like a series of rooms floating in empty space, connected only by both horizontal and vertical ladders. Narrow walkways suspended over massive pools of black water. One even mentioned a room where they could see the stars and the moon above. But they knew that they weren’t outside. Because they could still see the walls.

One of the few things that these reports had in common with each other was Sinclair. In each instance, he had been there. As far as the UK and as close as Mexico. All physical descriptions of him had been congruent with the man that we’d seen with our own eyes, though he’d apparently gone by a different name each time.

I asked her what kind of info she was able to dig up on the guy. She shook her head and told me absolutely nothing at all. She knew that records about him existed. Police and military reports, government files. But they were too classified for her to be able to access.

She said that she’d tried getting the police involved. She’d found another flyer advertising the house a few weeks prior. She’d responded to it and once she’d gotten an address, she’d marched down to the station and told them to investigate it. She’d told them about Anton, the building, all of the missing people. They’d simply told her that they’d look into it.

And then they went radio silent. No follow ups, nothing. She said it was almost like they were actively avoiding her.

I then asked her how she was planning on finding her brother. Did she even know where to look? She told me that Dixie had given her just enough information to be motivated to try. That she wasn’t necessarily confident, but it was worth a go. Because she wouldn’t be able to forgive herself otherwise.

We continued on through the corridors until it opened up into a larger space. This one looked the lobby in any old office building. Stale light, grey carpets, white walls. The faint smell of filtered air and old coffee. There was a couch and a few single chairs scattered in front of a receptionist’s deck.

There was a bowl of candies sitting on the desk and as I stared at it, I realized how hungry I’d become.

“I wouldn’t do it,” Nadia told me. “It’s probably not candy.”

I decided to hold off on taking one.

There were a set of doors to our right and an elevator to our left. We decided to go through the doors, opening them up to find an impossibly vast office space. Rows of cubicles, desks, water coolers that seemed to stretch on in perpetuity.

It didn’t seem so promising so we went back into the lobby, considered trying the elevator instead. But then we could hear a faint mechanical hum, the muffled straining of cables. We looked at the elevator and saw the up arrow illuminated above the doors. Something was headed up towards us. We weren’t keen on finding out what it was so we headed back towards the office space.

As we were walking, we could hear a ding, the doors sliding open behind us. We turned around and saw a figure marching towards us in the distance. Looked like an extremely tall man in a suit. Way too tall, his head nearly scraping the ceiling even though his back was heavily slouched. He had pale, clammy skin and long, greasy hair. As he got closer, we could make out this horrible expression of malice on his face. It was the way you’d look at somebody who you really wanted to hurt.

We turned away, started moving faster. And he continued to follow us. Over time, we noticed that his speed always remained constant. He never slowed down, never sped up. We found that we were able to outpace him if we maintained a very light jog. But after everything we’d already been through, this wasn’t exactly an easy thing to do.

Eventually our bodies would quit on us. No escaping that.

The office stretched on and everything looked the same. But eventually, we came across somebody sitting in one of the cubicles.

It was a young woman in a dress shirt and dress pants. She was sat in front of the computer, furiously typing away at the keyboard despite the screen displaying nothing but an empty, white light.

We tried asking her what she was doing and who she was. But she didn’t respond. She remained staring at the screen with her eyes glazed over, as if her consciousness existed entirely separate from us.

But with the man getting closer, we couldn’t afford to linger.

We moved on, starting to see more and more people in the cubicles. There were dozens, maybe hundreds of them. All dressed in the same shirt and pants and all typing away with that same empty stare.

We turned around, watching as the man moved past them without paying them any mind. We tried to ignore the implications of it.

We upped our pace but after a few more minutes, Nadia suddenly stopped dead in her tracks. Now she was staring intently into one of the cubicles.

We caught up to her and found her staring at a boy that seemed to be no older than sixteen or seventeen. We asked her who it was. She told us that it was one of her brother’s friends. He’d gone into the building with him that day. He’d also disappeared.

She walked into the cubicle and crouched down beside him.

“Hey buddy, where’s Anton?” she asked him. “Is he around here somewhere? Did you see where he went?”

He didn’t respond.  

“Where is he?” she repeated, now an edge in her voice. “When’s the last time you saw him?”

We had been standing still for too long and the man was getting uncomfortably close. I told her that we needed to start moving again.

She told me to give her a second and then grabbed the boy’s shoulder. She began shaking him.

“Hey!” she shouted at him. “Wake up! We need to find Anton! We need to get out of here!”

He wouldn’t budge. She tried pulling him away but he stopped typing and grabbed the desk, anchoring himself in place. His expression changed. Now he looked terrified, feverishly shaking his head while his eyes remained glued to the monitor.

The man was now about ten seconds away from reaching us and I stressed this fact to her.

Nadia cursed, slammed the table in frustration. She then backed out of the cubicle and we started running. The man had gotten so close to us that we could start to smell him. The best way I can describe the scent is a combination of ammonia and rotting fruit.

We continued on, alternating between jogging and speedwalking. But at this point, it was starting to feel like a losing battle. We were no closer to escaping the guy from when we started. And our bodies were feeling it. Knees aching, muscles heavy as lead, feet throbbing in our shoes.

Soon Josh had stopped moving. He caught his breath, shook his head.

“Fuck this,” he said. “I’m done with this shit.”

“What do you mean?” I asked him.

“I’m done with it,” he repeated. “I’m not playing this fucking game anymore.”

Nadia told him that we needed to keep moving.

He looked at her. “What did you say before? If you don’t allow this place to break you, it’ll set you free? Something like that?”

“I just meant that we shouldn’t give up,” she said to him “That as long as we move forward, we’ll eventually escape.”

“It’s fear, right?” he continued. “If we have no fear, then this place has no power over us.”

“No,” Nadia told him. “No, it’s not like that at all.”

“This isn’t going to end until we make it end.”

He turned around, began walking towards the man. We tried pulling him back but he yanked himself free.

“I’m not scared anymore,” he told us. “I’m getting the fuck out of here.”

He looked at the man as he approached. He raised his arms.

“Come get me!” he screamed at him. “I’m not fucking scared of you! I’m not-“

The man bent down and his jaw unhinged what had to be several feet. He grabbed Josh by the waist and picked him up and then shoved him into his throat.

I’m not sure how else to describe what happened. It was like there was a black hole waiting just beyond his mouth. Josh disappeared straight down into it. There was no struggle and the man didn’t even swallow. He just closed his mouth and continued on towards us.

We ran again. And this time, we didn’t stop until we finally reached the other end of this incomprehensible space. Waiting for us in the wall was another elevator. And it was a sight for sore eyes.

We only had the option to go down and so we pressed the button. And then we waited.

We’d managed to create a good amount of distance between us and the man so he was still a good ways away. But the elevator still hadn’t arrived and he was only getting closer.

We pressed the button again, as if it would help anything. And then again and again. We looked around to see if we’d missed a door, another elevator, a set of stairs, any kind of opening. But there was nothing.

Eventually the elevator did open up. And just in time. We rushed in there and the doors closed right as the man was unhinging his jaw again. That rotting ammonia smell lingered in the cabin and it was so strong I had to swallow back some bile.

We could feel ourselves start to move down. It was pitch black inside.

“You guys still there?” Kijoon asked.

We told him that we were. He seemed relieved.

I felt around the walls and it seemed like they were made out of glass. After a while, the cabin suddenly filled up with a dim, red light. It was a bit brighter than the light back in the corridors. But much more ominous once we realized the source of it.

We appeared to be descending down towards a vast, sprawling metropolis. We could see skyscrapers of varying shapes and sizes all packed tight together, stretching out in every direction as far as we could see.  It was hard to grasp the scale of the place. We must’ve been several miles up in the air and yet there were still buildings around that dwarfed us.

The sky above was dark and the only illumination came from the blood red lights emanating from the windows in the buildings. And then we realized that there wasn’t actually a sky at all. No stars, no moon, no clouds. Just a black sheet.

We looked down at the streets below and saw no cars, no people, no streetlights. Not even any sidewalks. But then we looked further out in the distance and saw a lone figure shambling towards the base of the elevator. And then we saw another one. And then more and more. Soon they were appearing in waves, crowds of dark shapes closing in on us from every direction.

We took a closer look and saw that some were crawling, others sprinting at full speed. Some appeared to be missing limbs while others were much more bizarre in appearance. Some didn’t seem human at all.

It wasn’t much longer before the streets below were completely filled. As if this were some kind of fucked up parade. The figures continued to flood in, becoming packed so tightly together that they were now scrambling over and atop each other. Soon they’d started climbing up the buildings that surrounded us.

The elevator began to descend slightly faster. Before long, we’d reach the bottom. Which was something that all three of us came to an unspoken agreement absolutely could not happen.

We looked around the cabin for a solution. There was nothing obvious at first. But we didn’t panic. After dealing with this place for as long as we had, we’d become hardened in a way. I’m sure that if we’d been in this situation earlier on, we would’ve shut down, given up.

But now we knew that this place had rules. Perhaps we didn’t understand them, but it didn’t seem likely that this elevator was meant to be a death sentence. Especially not after how far we’d come.

“The wall behind us,” I said.

Since it was made out of glass, we could see the floors passing by. If we timed it right, we could jump onto one.

I stepped back and kicked the glass as hard as I could. And I kept doing it. Soon the other two had joined in and we kicked and kicked until it cracked and we kept kicking until it shattered.

At this point, we could start to hear pounding on the glass all around us. I could see movement at the edges of my vision. But I tried not to spare it any attention.

We needed to focus. This was life or death.

Kijoon was the first to jump. We watched as he leapt forward and rolled onto one of the floors before immediately disappearing above us.

I held my breath. Nadia reached out and grabbed my hand. And then we jumped together.

I think we made it by less than an inch, landing hard on rough carpet. Seconds later, we heard the elevator crashing down into the ground. We turned around, finding several dark figures pressed up against the glass outside the shaft.

We stared at them and although we couldn’t make out any of their features, we could tell that they were staring right back at us. We were almost convinced that the moment we tried running away from them, they’d burst through the glass.

But they never did. Eventually they just disappeared, slowly retreating back down.

We stood there for a while longer until it felt safe enough to turn around. Once we did, we found yet another corridor ahead.

But this time, we didn’t have to walk for too long before we reached a door.

We didn’t immediately open it up. It could’ve been a trap. This could’ve been false hope. But bereft of any other option, we eventually took the chance and did so.

Immediately we were blinded by light. After our eyes had adjusted to it, we could see that it appeared to lead outside. Into a forest.

I walked out, breathed in the fresh air, listened to the chirping of the birds.

I then realized that this was the same clearing we’d first entered the building from. The same clearing that Sinclair had led us to. I turned around and sure enough the building was right there, the same way it’d looked when I’d first seen it. Three stories tall. Painted dark grey.

I took another look around at the forest. I felt the sun on my skin, watched the bugs crawling around on the ground.

We’d finally made it out. It felt surreal. I almost wanted to collapse and start crying. I looked over at Nadia, who was still standing in the doorway.

“We’re out,” I said to her. “We’re fucking free!”

She smiled. But she didn’t move. She just remained standing there.

“What’s the matter?” I asked her. “Let’s get the fuck out of this forest!”

She shook her head. “My brother’s still in there,” she said. “I came here for one reason. If I can’t find him, then I’m not leaving.”

I didn’t know how to respond to that.

“I could use some help looking for him, you know?” she continued. Her eyes were hopeful, almost pleading. “We made it out once. We could do it again after we find him.”

I thought about it for a while. And then I told her I couldn’t do that. That I was sorry, but I just couldn’t go back in there.

“It’s alright,” she said to me. “I don’t blame you. I just thought I’d ask.”

And with that, she turned around, walked back into the building. I remained watching her for a second. And then I got the fuck out of that forest.

Throughout that entire ordeal, I’d managed not to lose my car keys so I was able to drive away once I got back to the road. I contacted the police immediately after I got home. I gave the operator the coordinates from the email and then explained in detail everything that had happened. I even offered to come back down there to guide the officers over to exactly where the building was.

The operator thanked me for calling in and told me somebody would follow up with me soon.

This all happened weeks ago. And still nobody’s gotten back to me. I don’t know how many times I’ve called in, asking for an update. I’ve even gone down to the station in person. But every time they just tell me the same thing. That somebody would be following up with me.

It’s like the universe is telling me to just drop it. That I should just be grateful that I even made it out of there. That I shouldn’t be pushing my luck any further.

But I don’t know. That’s a bit of a hard pill to swallow. Josh is gone. Nadia’s still inside that place. Sinclair, or whatever the fuck his name really is, is still out there. That building is still out there.

I don’t think I’m ready to let this go. Not yet.
