[Everyone reading the post title](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1agurnk/how_to_survive_college_the_swimmers_arent_a/) is probably going OH NO NOT A HORSE right now.

YEP.  A HORSE.

Anyway, cheap earbuds ftw.  I don’t have to listen to the swimmers screaming the entire time I’m at the gym anymore.  I’m calling this problem solved and am going to try not to think about it anymore.  When this weight lifting class ends I’m going to get some little hand weights for my room and never go to the gym ever again.

We did a little experiment though.  Maria and Cassie went to the gym independently and tried the mirror trick.  Interestingly, neither of them could see the roots in the swimming pool.  Maria couldn’t even hear the swimmers.  It makes me wonder if there’s degrees of exposure to the inhuman world.  If perhaps I’m a lot more sensitive to it because of where I grew up.  It’s been a hunch of mine for a while, but I think this is the first testable evidence I’ve gotten that I might be right.

Maria is a little disappointed it didn’t work.  She wanted to show the Folklore Society president what was going on.  He’s being cautious ever since the graveyard, and Maria hopes that he might be able to help us.  She could be right.  He did seem like the kind of person to reevaluate his choices.

Besides, Maria taking a more active role in the Folklore Society has already had an unexpected… *benefit*.

As you can guess, I’m using that term very loosely, because having yet more problems dumped into your lap is hardly something anyone wants, especially during your junior year of college when you have enough to worry about with your classes suddenly getting a lot harder and all.  But I suppose it’s a benefit to the person that Maria dragged over to our apartment after the meeting let out.

“This is Rebecca,” Maria announced, striding in through the front door as soon as I’d opened it.

Rebecca crept in behind her, a small, mousy sort of girl with long, straight hair down to her waist.  Her backpack looked like it was filled with every textbook she owned and probably weighed almost as much as she did.  At Maria’s insistence, she perched awkwardly on the sofa while Maria went to the kitchen to make tea.

Maria has spent enough time at our apartment that she’s almost like a third roommate that doesn’t pay rent but actually refrains from eating all our food.  The teabags are the only thing she helps herself to because we keep those around specifically for guests (both Cassie and I have agreed to give up soda altogether) and because they’re the really cheap brand.

Grayson says it tastes like someone swept up the tea leaves spilled on the floor of the processing plant, burned them into charcoal, and then bagged them.  I told him he was a snob and that I can’t tell the difference.

(though that’s because I’ve never had anything else but I didn’t want to admit that)

Anyway, while Maria made us all terrible tea, I stood awkwardly in the living room and tried to make small talk with Rebecca.  She was a sophomore and had joined the Folklore Society just this year because it sounded interesting and her previous club had fallen apart at the end of last semester.  She figured she needed to be social *somehow* because - once again - she was stuck with a roommate she didn’t really like in the dorms and wanted to spend as little time there as possible.

Then Maria barged into the conversation and quickly moved us along to the reason she was here.

“Tell her about the horse!” she yelled from the kitchen.

I froze.  As I’m sure you’re all aware, my hometown has a *history* with horses.  And while I was not involved in any of those incidents, I certainly heard enough about them to have a deep-rooted terror of the animals.

“Yeah, there was a horse on campus,” she said.  “It was really weird.  I saw it standing in the middle of the green.  There wasn’t anyone near it and I thought maybe it had gotten out of one of the farms outside of town and was lost.  It let me get really close to it, too.”

Commence internal screaming.

“Did you pet the horse?” I asked as calmly as I could.

“I… I wanted to.”  She shifted uncomfortably on the sofa.  “But, I, um.  I tripped.”

She wasn’t even sure what she tripped over.  She supposed she just wasn’t paying attention to where she was going.  Her gaze was fixed on the horse, after all, like she couldn’t tear her eyes off it.  It was a beautiful horse, its coat like coal, glistening with undertones of green and blue like the ocean.

“I’m worried about it,” she said anxiously.  “I don’t think it’s being taken care of.  It looked like it was wet and it stunk.  I could smell it even before I got close.  Like pond weed.  And its mane was *super* matted.”

I swear the day I turn 21 I’m buying a bottle of whiskey so I can have something to dramatically take swigs of in situations like this.  Cheap whiskey, though.  I don’t have a job yet for the school year and am living off what I made over the summer working at the farm supply store in the next town over.

Fortunately, Maria appeared at that moment with tea.  It’s probably not actually soothing, considering we don’t buy any decaf, but at least it gave me something else to focus on while I collected my thoughts.

Cause holy shit the kelpie from my freshman year was back.

“Have you ever heard of a kelpie?” I asked.

“I knew it!” Maria hissed.

Yeah she’s done a lot of reading on her own.  Honestly she might know more than me at this point, she’s making more of an effort at it while I’m just kind of relying on what I’ve picked up during my childhood.

Rebecca did not know what a kelpie was.  Maria and I gave her a quick rundown.  Murderous horses that drown people.  Don’t approach it.  Don’t touch it.  *Especially* don’t touch it.  If she saw it again, just walk away and call campus security.

“Do you think campus security will actually do anything about it?” Maria asked thoughtfully, after we’d sent her on her way with promises to be careful and some recommended reading from the library.

You know what?  After hiding from them while they clubbed some swimmers into goo, I bet they could and if I’m wrong… I really don’t care.  I reminded Maria of this and while I don’t think she quite shared my ire towards them, she at least agreed that they were probably better equipped to handle a kelpie than Rebecca was.

“I should probably let the club president know too,” she said, typing furiously at her phone.  “I didn’t want to say anything during the meeting since we had people there that aren’t in the know about all… *this.*”

I nodded absently.  I was also texting someone.  Grayson, specifically.  If there was something new on campus, then he should probably know about it.  I asked if he had time to drop by the apartment.  He said he had a few hours before his next class and would be over soon.

He’d probably be uncomfortable talking about this sort of stuff with Maria present, but I didn’t care by that point.  We all needed to be on the same page, if new creatures were moving into campus.

Okay that’s a lie, I was so nervous putting Grayson in this position that I wanted to throw up.  What if he hated me for it?  What if he yelled at me?  What if he never wanted to see me again?  I could barely focus on Maria’s speculation and finally had to ask her if we could just wait to talk this through when Grayson arrived.

He took about twenty minutes to get here and when he arrived, he had brought his own tea bags - the little shit.  So we waited for the water to boil again and then when that was all ready we finally sat down in the living room, the three of us crammed on that tiny sofa, to figure out what to do with the kelpie.

“Oh, you still have it?”  Grayson asked, reaching for the petrified wood sitting in the middle of it.

Nearby, Titanosaur watched from the devil box, his eyes as round as marbles, fixed intently on Grayson’s hand.

Please don’t read too much into that, Titan greets all our guests by staring at them from the devil box.  He’s also interested in anything that moves.  There was a 50/50 chance of Grayson being attacked by a gigantically overweight cat simply for picking something up.

Assuming Titan could clear the table, that is.  He struggles with jumping.  My bedsheets are riddled with snags from him climbing his way up.

“Yeah, I got talked into keeping it,” I said, totally glossing over *who* had talked me into it.  “So there’s a kelpie on campus.”

He set the stone back down with a sigh.

“I know,” he said.  “There’s been quite a few sightings.  Doesn’t appear that it’s dragged anyone off yet at least.  I don’t suppose you know how to get rid of a kelpie?”

“Not really.  They weren’t a problem back home.”

We all sat in glum silence, staring at Titanosaur who stared unblinkingly back at us.

“We’ve run into a kelpie before,” I said tentatively.  “Or at least, we found that it’d been killed.”

Both Grayson and Maria jerked their heads around to stare at me.  That was when I remembered that *I hadn’t told them about that*.  If you’ve forgotten, in my freshman year I saw a kelpie in the nearby river and when we went to investigate, I found signs that it’d been killed and dragged off by the giant eyeball monster.  I, uh, didn’t tell Grayson at the time.  So I quickly filled them in now just Iike I’m filling you all in.

“You know, that’s interesting,” Maria said thoughtfully.  “Because there’s no creatures on campus that are recognizable in folklore.”

“I think campus is keeping them out,” I said.

The eyeball was a weapon.  The flickering man enforced the rules.  But now both of those were gone and the gates to campus were thrown metaphorically open.

“I’m *positive* campus is keeping them out,” Grayson sighed.  “Or at least, it’s trying to.”

Okay.  This was good.  He was speaking freely about his privileged information on the inner workings on campus.  He wasn’t mad I’d dragged him into this conversation with Maria present.

“Can we… push campus to react?” I ventured.  “I’ve seen the traveling river sweep things away before.  Can we… ask it for help?”

Maria was almost vibrating on the sofa with excitement.

“No,” Grayson said firmly.  Maria was visibly crestfallen.  “You can’t bargain with the river.  I know that much.”

I licked my lips.  No one was going to like this suggestion.  I didn’t like it.

“What if someone was in danger?  I thought that the times it showed up were just coincidence - but it actually saved me, I think.”

We discussed my idea quite a bit.  Grayson was reluctant, but he eventually admitted that it could work.  The river *might* intervene.  It wasn’t without risks, obviously.  Its way of eliminating things that didn’t belong on campus was to sweep them away and it would be very easy for anyone nearby to be caught up in that current.

“That is a super dangerous plan,” Maria said flatly.

“But it’s only a matter of time before someone like Rebecca pets the pretty horsey,” I replied miserably.

We did consider a few alternatives, to our credit.  Grayson ruled out relying on campus security.  He has a low opinion of their competence.  We both vetoed Maria’s suggestion of lassoing the kelpie for very obvious reasons that I shouldn’t need to explain to all of you.  In the end, we had to admit that the risky plan might be the one to try.  We certainly didn’t want to just ignore the problem.

We’d try to trigger the river’s intervention in a controlled, safe manner.  We’d go as a group.  One person would act as bait by approaching the horse.  Another person would be on standby to run in and either pull the bait back if they got too close or if the kelpie made a move towards them.  The idea was to get close enough to danger to spur the river to intervene, but not close enough to actually touch the horse.

And the third person would be parked along the road that led out of campus, towards the river where I first saw the kelpie.

We weren’t certain what would kill a kelpie, but we figured that being hit by a car might just do the trick.

That person would have to be Maria or Grayson, as I don’t have a car.  They did rock-paper-scissors and Maria lost, meaning she would be the one to potentially sacrifice her car.

“My parents are going to kill me if it gets to this point,” she grumbled.  “You two had better not touch the horse.”

Then Grayson and I squared off in another round of rock-paper-scissors to see who had to be bait.

I lost.

I was bait.

Of course.

After that it was just waiting for the right time to enact our terrible plan.  It didn’t take long.  The kelpie was itching to drag someone screaming into the depths, apparently, because in under 24 hours I was getting a text from Maria that someone had spotted the horse.  It was along the edge of campus, where a vast field stretched for quite a ways before finally hitting a road.  Grayson mentioned as we walked over that the campus planned to buy that land when they next needed to expand.

“Are you nervous?” he asked when I didn’t reply.

“Obviously.”

He squeezed my hand.

“I’m right here.  I’ll call it off if something looks amiss.  With lots of yelling and dragging you away from the horse, if necessary.”

We found the horse, as if it were waiting for us.  There wasn’t anyone else around, not on this edge of campus where there wasn’t much more than the music building in one corner and then a row of staff parking lots.  It stood at the edge of the asphalt, its mane and tail unmoving in the stiff breeze.  I could see the pond weed matted into its mane and the way it glistened wetly in the hazy sunlight.

I took a deep breath and approached the horse.  No more than ten feet.  That was what we’d decided on.  Just enough to get its attention - and hopefully the river’s.  I felt like this plan wasn’t going to work, that we were being too careful and wouldn’t be in enough danger to actually merit the river’s intervention.  But we’d try and if it didn’t work… we’d have to figure something else out.

The horse raised its head and stared at me, its eyes dark and shining like glass.

“*You*,” it hissed.  “I *remember* you.”

It wasn’t just a kelpie.  It was the kelpie from the river.  The one that saw me and I saw it.  I stumbled backwards.

“B-but - you died!”

Its cold black eyes were fixed on me and although it didn’t speak, I knew that its death was irrelevant.  It had died.  Its body was smashed and dragged into the river.  Yet it was here, because stories don’t simply die like that, and it was angry at me for… reasons?

“It wasn’t my fault,” I whispered, my chest tight with terror.  It was hard to breathe.  “I didn’t know.”

Hadn’t I stood by while Patricia and all the others died and birthed that abomination?  Hadn’t I led it to the river where the kelpie was laying in wait, oblivious that it would soon be hunted itself?

The kelpie jerked forward.  Its hooves propelled it toward me in a long lunge.  I heard Grayson yell, his voice high with fear.  Then the horse’s chest struck me and I was thrown backwards, landing hard on the ground.  My body was leaden with fear, unable to even cry out in surprise.  I lay there,  staring up at the kelpie’s body, at its legs poised in midair.  I couldn’t see anything else.  It was like darkness had swallowed up the world around me and the only point of light left was illuminating the hooves that would soon descend and crack my skull open.

Then I was underwater.

Like the river opened up right beneath me.  I was tumbling, the cold of the water shocking me into helpless immobility.  I felt the current pulling at my body, turning me over and over.  There was one moment of clarity, where I was staring down at the depths of the river, descending into blackness.

Beneath me was the kelpie.  Its hooves churned furiously at the water, its eyes were white, and its mouth was open in a silent, enraged scream.  Its teeth were sharp.  I noticed that.  Sharp little ivory teeth as it thrashed, fighting the pull of the water that dragged it down and down and down.

Then the water turned me over, I slammed into something hard and unyielding - the bank? - and then faint, sharp pain raked across the back of my arm.

Like nails, I thought distantly.

Then the nails dug into the flesh of my forearm as the hand finally found a way to clamp down on something solid.  Another hand grabbed my upper arm.  And then a third grabbed my other arm and pulled with inhuman strength.

I was wrenched upwards and I broke through the surface of the river.  I gasped, coughed, and kicked frantically as they dragged me out of the water.  Then I lay on the grass, choking as my lungs tried to expel the water I’d swallowed.  Grayson was patting me on the back.  But if he was beside me, then who was standing directly in front of me?

I raised my eyes and stared up at the laundry lady, her face pulled into a severe, unforgiving frown, the sort of look a mother would give you when you Done Fucked Up Bad.

“A kelpie!” she shrieked.  “I knew as soon as I saw you skulking your way over here that it was going to end badly.  And I was right, wasn’t I?  You’re damn lucky I’ve been keeping an eye on that thing.”

“Y-you have?” I croaked.

She pursed her lips, the wrinkles at the corner of her eyes deepening as she narrowed her gaze at me.

“Of course I have.  Can’t have some idiot dragging horse stench into the laundry rooms because they wanted to hug the pony.  You students are impulsive enough to do stuff like that.  ‘Oh look at that cute animal let me rub my body against it and then let my clothing rot for a week before finally throwing it in the washing machine.’”

I think the college has an agricultural branch on the outskirts of town and I guess she’s not a fan of students that frequent it - or more specifically, the odors they bring back with them.

She glared down at both of us, her hands on her hips.

“You owe me,” she snapped.  “*Both* of you owe me.”

She turned on heel and stalked off.  I think she yelled something over her shoulder about how I need to bring my laundry on campus sometime so she can wash it, I don’t know, I wasn’t listening at that point.  The shock of the kelpie and the river was wearing off and I was now sobbing.

“You’re okay,” Grayson gasped, wrapping his arms around me and holding me tight to his chest.  “That was way too close.  I’m sorry.  I should never have suggested this.  I just - I didn’t think it would attack you like that.”

I was breathless and unable to reply.  I just sat there, crying, dripping wet and shivering violently.

“I don’t want to lose you,” he continued, drawing back from his embrace.  “You’re important to me.”

Then he kissed me.

And I guess I should feel happy about all that.  Isn’t that what we all want to hear from someone we might kinda sorta have feelings for, right?  That we’re important to them?  That we matter?  That maybe they might even love us?

I’m not happy.  I just feel… I don’t know.  Confused.  Worried.

Because something else happened.  Just a small, slight thing that I keep turning over and over in my head.  I don’t want to say it because I know what all the comments will say and *I don’t want that*, I want to feel like someone cares about me.  I want to be happy.  I want to feel safe with someone for once.

I’m just going to write this out and post it before I change my mind.

Maria asked me, once we were back at my apartment and after Grayson had gone home, what made me change my mind.

I asked what she meant by that.  She blinked at me in confusion and then repeated herself with a little more elaboration.  Why did I decide to bait the kelpie, she asked, instead of Grayson?

“Uh, because I lost?” I said.

But I didn’t, she said.  She was there.  She saw.  I won.  It was supposed to be Grayson that baited the horse.

I didn’t know what to say to that, so I just told her that it just kind of worked out that way.  She accepted that as a reasonable explanation and dropped it.  It was a small detail.  The kind of conversation that is forgotten as soon as it's over.  I doubt Maria will think much of it again.

That’s why I’m telling all of you, though, even though I don’t really want to hear what you’ll inevitably say.  Because why do I remember it differently than Maria?  Which one of us is wrong? [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
