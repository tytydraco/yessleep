I’ve always fucking hated the sound of chewing. Not just hate it—it’s like a drill boring into my brain, ripping away at my nerves with every damn smack of lips. It’s the worst sound a human can make—wet, sloppy, like they’re grinding raw meat into mush without a care in the world. Fucking pigs, all of them.

You know the sound, right? That wet, sticky noise that pisses you off. It’s not just annoying; it digs in deep, setting off alarms in your head. Fight or flight, but for me, it’s always been fight—rip the fucking throats out of anyone who makes that sound.

That night was supposed to be routine. I was driving home after a long shift, nothing special. The sky was dark, choked with clouds, and the only light came from my headlights, hardley illuminating the road through the thick fog. It was the kind of night that seemed to swallow sound, where every noise felt like it was swallowed by the void. The road stretched out before me, a dark ribbon winding through the empty countryside. Trees lined the road like silent sentinels.

I hadn’t planned to drive this way. The main highway had been blocked off due to some accident, and I had to take this backroad to avoid the mess. The GPS on my phone was useless, no signal out here, just me and the road. It felt like driving through the gullet of some giant beast.

The stillness was almost palpable, as though the world itself had gone quiet. There were no birds, no rustle of leaves—just the sound of my car tires against the pavement. I tried to distract myself, turning up the radio and focusing on the static, but even that seemed to fade into the background, swallowed by the overwhelming quiet.

And then my car, faithful piece of shit that it is, decided it was time to take a break. One minute, the engine was purring along like it had a purpose. The next, it sputtered, coughed, and finally gave up. The dashboard lights blinked out, the engine went dead, and the car rolled to a stop on the side of the road. It was like the car knew it was the perfect time to fuck with me.

“Shit. Fuck!” I hissed through clenched teeth, pounding the steering wheel in frustration.

 I turned the key in the ignition, but it was a wasted effort. The engine sputtered once, then fell silent. No matter how hard I twisted, it refused to start. Dead as a doornail.

I grabbed my phone, but of course, there was no signal. No surprise there. Just me, a dead car, and miles of empty road. Walking wasn’t an option. It was miles back to the last shitty town I passed, and God knows how far to the next one. I was trapped, stranded in the middle of nowhere with nothing but the silence and my own growing sense of dread.

I tried to calm myself, taking deep breaths and gripping the steering wheel like it was a lifeline. I stared out into the darkness, trying to make out shapes in the fog. That’s when I heard it—the first hint of something wrong. A distant sound, barely. At first, I thought it was my imagination, a trick of the mind.

But then it came again—chewing. A wet, sticky sound, like someone tearing into raw meat with their bare teeth. The noise was faint at first, almost like it was coming from a distance, but it grew louder, more distinct. It was like it was closing in on me, getting closer with every passing second. I froze, my skin crawling. Every instinct I had was screaming at me to stay still, but I couldn’t help myself. Slowly, I turned my head to look out the rear window. It was dark, the fog thick and obscuring everything, but I could make out a shape moving in the distance. It was hunched over, its silhouette was unnatural.

The shape moved closer, and as it came into the view of my headlights, I saw it more clearly. It was a figure—tall, impossibly thin. It was like a twisted mockery of a human, its limbs elongated, joints popping and cracking with every movement. Its skin was sickly pale, almost translucent, revealing the dark veins running beneath.

It was eating something. I could see its mouth working, tearing into flesh with a sickening squelch. What’s left of a human leg is dangling from its mouth. Strips of flesh hang off the bone, dripping blood onto the pavement. The shoe is still on, twisted at a grotesque angle. It rips another chunk off, tearing through the flesh with broken, jagged teeth.

My stomach churned violently, and I felt bile rise in my throat. I wanted to scream, to get out of the car, but I was paralyzed. My hands shook uncontrollably as I reached for the door lock, pressing it down with a shaky finger. The click echoed loudly in the oppressive silence, a desperate sound in the void.

But the thing didn’t even notice. It was too focused on its grisly feast, the sound of its chewing growing louder, more intense. The smell of blood and death seeped into the car, a rancid stench that made me gag. I turned away from the window, pressing my back against the door, hoping against hope that it would just go away.

But it didn’t. The chewing stopped abruptly, and I could feel its presence—its attention. The thing lifted its head, and I saw its face more clearly. The eyes were black, soulless voids, and the mouth—oh God, the fucking mouth... I't was a gaping maw filled with broken, needle like teeth, blood still dripping from them. It seemed to smile, a sickening, knowing grin that twisted my insides.

“Fuck… fuck, no!” I screamed, my voice cracking with terror.

 I fumbled with the keys, jamming them into the ignition and twisting with all my strength. The engine sputtered once, twice, and then died completely. The car was dead, and so was any hope I had of escaping.

The thing was right outside my window now, its breath hot and wet against the glass. The stench was overpowering, making me retch, but I couldn’t move. I pressed myself back into the seat, every fiber of my being screaming to flee, but I was frozen, paralyzed by fear.

It pressed its face against the glass, that horrible smile never faltering. Its mouth opens wider—wider than any human mouth should, the jaw seeming to unhinge like a fucking snake’s. The chewing sound gets louder, like it’s right inside my head, eating at my brain. And then it starts to laugh, a wet, choking noise that makes my skin crawl.

“Fuck you,” I spit, but my voice is a whimper, trembling. 

Tears stream down my face, hot and stinging, but I can’t wipe them away. I’m too scared to move.

Then it starts grinning. That fucking grin, and then… it’s gone. Just like that. The chewing, the breathing, the stench—it all vanishes as the thing backs away, dragging whatever’s left of that poor fucker with it into the dark.

I don’t move. Not for what feels like hours. My whole body is locked in place, my mind trying to process what the fuck just happened. Eventually, exhaustion takes over, and I pass out, right there in the driver’s seat.

When I woke up, I was in the hospital. Hooked up to machines, my body covered in cuts and bruises. The nurses told me I’d been in an accident—that they’d found my car wrapped around a tree, miles from the nearest town. They said I was lucky to be alive.

But I knew better. That thing… that fucking thing… it let me live. It wanted me to remember. Wanted me to carry that sound with me for the rest of my life.

And now, every time I close my eyes, I hear it. That goddamn chewing. Wet, sticky, echoing inside my skull.

It’s inside me now. And I know one day, it’s going to finish what it started.
