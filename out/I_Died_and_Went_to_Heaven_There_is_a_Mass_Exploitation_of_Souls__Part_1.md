I was in a rush to get to Church the night I died. 

Me and my family were very devout Catholics and we would always find time to go to church every weekend to praise our lord and savior. After a week of focusing on our own lives and giving all our time to building our success, an hour for God was nothing.

The sense of community that was hotly present in the church gave me and my family a feeling of warmth. I listened intently to the weeks scripture, and received the Eucharist with such compassion. As the bread dissolved in my mouth, I felt the spirit of our lord enter into me. I had never taken drugs, but I was certain that the feelings I felt were the same as getting high. It was always Euphoric!

It was the least we could do for our lord and savior who literally died for us. 

A constant argument would arise with my daughter when It would come time to go to church.

“I don’t want to go!” she would always argue “My show is on at that time!”

I would always smile at her expected arguments. 

“Gracie, Didn’t Jesus sacrifice his whole life for all of us?” I would reply. “So can you not sacrifice one hour for him? Besides your show is on Netflix. You can watch it whenever”

She would sigh and walk as if the weight of the whole world was on her shoulders. It happened every week, and it eventually became a routine. I found it amusing at how much children hated going to church. But in my heart, I knew that she would eventually grow on it, as all good practicing Roman Catholics do.

But I wish I let her stay home that night.

Now that I look back at it, she was a lot more unwilling to go that night. Everything she was doing was simply taking longer, and I knew that was her act of rebellion. Gracie was turning thirteen and the hormones of teenagers were starting to come through. It seemed like this was the night it all started to come through.

Mass was at 6pm and my Wife was ready and waiting in the car. But Gracie was still not dressed and it was already 5.50pm! 

“Oh come on you stupid girl!” I yelled at her as she intentionally examined every dress in her closet. Something she had never done before.

“Why can’t you and Mum just go? You know I hate it Dad. Honestly, it feels like I am forced to go all the time” Gracie said

As much as I hate to say this, I was seeing red after hearing what she said. How could my daughter who I had invested so much time and energy into getting all her sacrament’s and sending her to a Catholic school, say such bile.

Without a second thought, I slapped her over the head. 

“You Bitch!” I yelled at her “Everything I do for you and you can’t do this one thing for me!”

Gracie held her head in pain and shock at my sudden lashing out at her. I hadn’t hit her this hard before. She sobbed as she looked to the ground with her hair covering her face.

I glanced at the clock on her wall and saw that time was passing, and we were now going to be late. I made it an effort to NEVER be late for Church. This made me even more angrier and I grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her until her face was next to mine.

“GET DRESSED!” I shouted in her face.

At that moment I saw the eyes of my daughter, and they were absolutely filled with terror towards me. At the time I wasn’t moved at all. 

But that look on her face has left an unhealing wound in my heart.

My wife had heard all the commotion from outside, and rushed in to see what was happening. She saw Gracie upset and immediately went to comfort her.

“For Goodness sake Mariell, we are going to be late! Get her dressed and lets go!!” I shouted

“I’m not going to church” Gracie replied amongst her tears very soberly

“YES YOU ARE!” I shouted in a huff

“NO I AM NOT! I will never enter that church again!” she yelled back to me. “NEVER!”

I was so hostile at that point, that I could have punched through a brick wall and it would have been less painful than the betrayal I was feeling. 

I pointed at my wife “Get her dressed and in the car! ILL BE WAITING. HURRY UP!” and with that I went and waited in the car. As I left the room and made my way downstairs I could hear Gracie telling her mother that she was not going to enter that church again.

“We will see about that” I mumbled to myself

Every second was making me even more frustrated as I sat waiting for them in the car. By the time they came it was already five past six. To make me even more angered, Gracie wore a Cradle of Filth band shirt that depicted horrible images in mockery to Christianity. This rebellion stage of her youth was going to be a real struggle. My anger was unbearable and I made no hesitation in reversing out of the driveway and driving off once they were both inside. 

It was a ten minute drive to Church, and I did not want to miss the scripture readings. So I sped.

Gracie remained stoic throughout the whole drive, despite my reckless driving, constantly whispering to herself as she looked outside of the window “I am not going to church again”

My wife told me to slow down on multiple occasions as I nearly went off the road around a few tight corners. She was absolutely terrified by my driving, and I wish I had listened to her.

Our country road had a lot of lush grass on the council owned strip that farmers would often allow their cows to graze upon at dusk when the road was not as busy. Many signs were scattered along the road, warning drivers to slow down in case of stock crossing the road.

I paid no heed to them.

I drifted around a corner, going close to 120km/hr, and drove straight into a herd of Cattle crossing the road.

The big Cow that I hit, crashed through the windscreen and landed on top of me and my wife in the front seat. The car went out of control and rolled down a gully, smashing hard into a sturdy Grey-box tree. 

Upon hitting the tree, I was unable to move, and the car remained on its roof. The Cow was still alive, and she kicked and kicked, until she managed to somehow free herself and stumble onto the grass below where she slowly died.

My gut clenched when I saw my wife, or what remained of her. The kicking of the Cow had absolutely mangled her, and I knew in my heart that she was gone. 

“Gracie!” I called out as I struggled to move in my seat. I couldn’t see her and couldn’t hear her.

“Gracie, baby speak to me” 

But still there was silence. 

The delirium of the whole situation was making me unaware of my surroundings, and I fought to try and move, but something was preventing me.

I looked down and saw that my stomach was crushed between the steering column and the roof. At this moment I realized that I could not feel my lower body. 

“Gracie!”

I kept on shouting her name as I desperately tried to move to find her. 

An unnatural strength took over me and I pushed with all my might on the steering wheel and managed to free myself from it. However, at the moment I was freed, I felt the delirium grow stronger almost exponentially and my superhuman strength began to fade very fast.

I turned around to Gracie's seat but couldn’t see her. I felt a strange movement around my stomach and looked down, only to see my intestines falling out of the hole that was made by the steering column. But it didn’t matter. I just needed to find my Gracie.

I crawled to the edge of the rear window opposite of where she was sitting and saw the sight I was dreading to see.

A pair of legs protruded from under the car, underneath the very space that I lay upon. At that moment, I felt my heart dissolve, and all of my life force was extinguished. My Gracie was Dead. And it was all my fault.

I collapsed into a heap and with the last bit of energy I had in me, I whispered to Gracie who lay crushed directly beneath me that I was sorry. 

The last thought to be on my mind as death took over was failure. I had failed my family.

And so With that, me and my family departed this Earth.

But it was only the beginning.

As the life left my lungs everything went black. But within a few seconds, I felt a great pull. Slowly I was lifted until I could see the top of my own head lying motionless on the inner roof of the car. I then left the car and was lifted into the air.

Looking at the carnage below I shuddered, especially upon seeing the pale legs of Gracie. Surely there was a way out of this I thought to myself. Surely this was not it. It couldn’t end like this.

The clouds started to shield my view of the accident and I felt the speed of the pulling grow faster at an exponential rate. Within what felt like a few minutes, I could see the whole planet, and it quickly started to get smaller and smaller as I was taken through the Sun, and then deeper and deeper into space. The sun faded from a great ball of light, to a star, to a tiny spec, to nothing as I went further and further away.

I was deeply afraid and felt cold at how far I was from the place I once called home. Around this time was when it dawned to me that I must be going to Heaven.

The only thought on my mind up until this point was that of regret and sorrow for my wife and daughters demise at my own negligence. But the comforting thought  of reuniting with them in Heaven drifted into my mind as I watched the universe fly past me.

In my heart, I knew that I was travelling to Heaven. I was going to meet God! And even better, my family would be there too! I laughed in utter joy as I rode with the pull. Our devotion to God and our constant attendance and reverence at Mass, had surely allowed us this place in Heaven. I was certain that they would be waiting for me in paradise!

After what I could best judge to be an hour since the accident, I was travelling at speeds that I can barely describe in writing. It was faster than light by what felt like an infinite amount. Yet I was able to move around as though I was floating in water.

I noticed the area around me start to get brighter, and I turned to face the direction I was heading, only to see an Awe inspiring sight. An almighty great sphere of white light was pulling me. I knew that this was heaven. This must be what it felt like to see the light.

Suns and stars felt like dust as I passed them, and compared to this sphere of light, they were less than an atom..

Id imagine that the brightness of this sphere would instantly blind a living man. But being in the soul form that I was in, I felt no pain, nor burning. It was not boiling hot, nor cold.

It was the same warmth that one would feel in the arms of their parents.

“Oh Gracie,” I laughed to myself “This is why I wanted you to go to church! Now we can be at peace forever”

At this point I felt a great shake and the pulling seemingly paused for a little bit. But it soon resumed, pulling me in a slightly different direction than before. I didn’t understand why it stopped so suddenly. But either way, I was still heading in the direction of the sphere.

The sphere came closer, until the light from It had encompassed the whole area I was occupying. I was now so close to it, that I could hardly tell which way it was, as all around me was like I was looking at a wall of light. 

Around this point, the pulling stopped.

I stood in the almighty light, alone and not sure of what to do.

Was I to meet the Lord for my judgment?

I had no idea what I was to do, and there was no clear place where I was to walk to. All I could see was light.

I started to walk, not knowing where it would lead me to, feeling in my heart that it was worth a try. 

After a few minutes of walking, I came across an individual standing in the light.

“Hello?” I called to them. “I am not sure of where I am to go”

The being turned to me and I instantly fell to my knees at the presence of it. It was an Angel.

“You do not belong here!” the Angel replied as it came closer.

I was lost for words as to what to say to it. Being well versed in the Bible, I knew that the biblically accurate Angels were terrible to behold and unlike the cute little Babies that culture has depicted them over the centuries. I knew what to expect, but upon seeing it, I was afraid.

“Rise!” The Angel said as it stood over me

I slowly stood up. The Angel towered over me like an Elephant. 

“Look into my eyes!” the Angel demanded

Even though I was in heaven, I was so afraid. I hesitantly turned my gaze to the Angel. We locked eyes for what felt like an eternity.

They were dark and empty, with multiple scattered all around its head. It almost had a similar face to that of a spider, only it lacked a mouth. The being I was speaking to was communicating into my mind.

“Thou hast not been judged yet!” The Angel said in a booming voice “You will follow me to the place of judgment. God is waiting for you!”

The Angel began to walk, and like a dog on a lead, I felt a pull in the same direction. I couldn’t leave it.

We walked for what felt like two of my lifetimes. Not once did we cross paths with other beings or some sort of structure. It was just the two of us and the all-encompassing light.

Eventually, we finally came to a great structure. It was an enormous palace, beyond which any word could describe. It was made of colors I had never conceived of before, and it had strange shapes that altered the very fundamentals of physics. The only thing I could say about it was that its height could literally be described as being the same as the distance between the Earth and the moon.

And for the first time in what felt like infinity, I saw other people. They were all lining up to enter into the palace. 

Souls were constantly appearing out of nowhere and joining the queue which was heavily guarded by Angels. I deemed that these were the souls of the recently deceased. Perhaps this was where I was meant to arrive at. 

The Angel who was dragging me along did not put me in the line with all the other souls. It skipped the Queue and went straight in through the grand entrance of the palace. Here the line continued even longer, and the angel continued to skip in front. 

Eventually we came to the head of the line and I felt somewhat embarrassed. It seemed as though everyone had been waiting for me to arrive. It wasn’t my fault that I was taken to the wrong location, I had no control over the pull after all.

The Angel forcefully shoved me into the head of the line and I stood in front of another grand doorway. The door was closed and two Wheel shaped beings that I knew were Thrones, stood guard on either side. Their hundreds of eyes were locked onto me and I felt great intimidation.

The doors finally swung open, and an even brighter light of an indescribable colour shone through the doorway. Out from the doorway came none other than my beautiful wife, Mariell. She had two Angels of flame, which I deemed were Seraphim, following closely behind her. Guilt pinned my heart upon seeing her and knowing that it was my actions that led her to death.

“Mariell!” I called out to her 

“Tim!” she replied in a very cheery tone “I am to seek an audience with God! This has to be the greatest moment of my existence!”

I tried to get closer to her but I was unable to move. “I am sorry babe!” 

Mariell kept on walking with the Seraphim as she replied with that gorgeous smile she always melted my heart with. “Do not be sorry hunny. We are in paradise. All will be well soon. You will see!” 

I instinctively turned around to see a random soul behind me, and looked at those further back and could not see Gracie. 

“What about Gracie?!” I shouted to her as she faded into the light. “Was she before you?!” 

Mariell did not respond and she disappeared from my sight.

In my Heart, I was certain that Gracie would have been in front of my wife, as I knew she had died first when the car crushed her. 

Two Seraphim came out of the door, and I felt myself being pulled in. I closed my eyes and spoke to Gracie in my heart. 

“We will be together soon, Gracie. Ill never leave you”

I opened my eyes, and saw myself standing in an enormous room, that rivalled even that of the foyer where the infinite line of souls waited outside. 

Standing in front of me, I felt the presence of an almighty individual. There was no form to it, save the bright and strange colour that towered over me. I felt like an ant next to it. I instinctively dropped to my knees in fear and respect to this almighty being.

Was this God? 

Surely not, as my wife had just said she is going to see God after coming out of here. This being was more terrible and almightier than even the Angels that I was intimidated by. If this was not God, then there was nothing in my Christian knowledge I could have said it was. This being had to be God. How could there be someone ever more intimidating and greater than it?

“Timothy Anthony Robbins” came the booming voice of the being. My whole core shook at how deep it was. “RISE!”

Without a second thought I rose to my feet and looked up to the brightest part of this already bright individual, which I knew was its face.

“Husband to Mariell Robbins and Father to Gracie Jane Robbins. How do you feel about their deaths?”

I was not expecting this from this almighty individual. The way it spoke sounded like it was mocking me too. 

“Guilt my lord. Tremendous Guilt” I replied. “I was in a rush to get to Church so that I can praise you. I never missed a single mass in my-“

“SILENCE!” The voice roared like thunder.

“Typical primitive Human trying to justify their actions. I do not care if you always attended Church. That was not the question! I only asked to see your state of mind after the events of your demise!”**

I felt tears rushing down my face. Was I going to Hell now? If so, I knew I deserved it. I just hoped that Gracie was alright and that she would be enjoying paradise with Mariell. I had no response to the almighty judge.

“At least your mortal pride is humbled by your immortal Guilt. That alone makes you a lot more valuable.”

“Am I spared from Hell then oh God?” I softly replied in such eagerness to know my fate.

“DO NOT SPEAK WITHOUT CONSENT! I am not God. Only a part of God. If you are where you stand, then your life choices already avoided Hell. I only determine what becomes of your soul based on your emotions surrounding your death.”

I dared not speak anymore. This being was too intimidating and I knew my place was to remain silent, despite my infinite number of questions.

As everything did since my death, a tremendous amount of time passed by before the judge spoke again.

“Why did you arrive so far from the queue?”

This question caught me by surprise

“I’m not sure. I was being pulled towards the light, and felt a slight shake before being pulled in another direction, still heading to the light.”

Once again there was silence.

“Did you see him?”

I was confused.

“I’m sorry, I didn’t see anyone lord. It was only me until I met the Angel”

The Judge chuckled to itself 

“The fool can can’t catch the faithful”

I had no idea what the Judge was talking about, but I deemed it had something to do with some enemy of his. Perhaps it was referring to the devil himself. Whatever it was, I had no place to say anything and I just prayed in my heart that I would see my Gracie soon.

“Based off the emotions surrounding your demise, your Soul has been Judged. You will be seeking an Audience with God.”

My eyes lit up upon hearing this. I was going to where Mariell had gone. No words could describe the relief I was feeling upon hearing that. As long as we were going to the same place, everything would be alright. The question of where Gracie was, would surely be answered soon enough.

The two Seraphim that guided me in, now guided me back out of the room, and I was taken in the direction where Mariell had just gone. I felt the same joy as she had felt, and I made sure that I was well composed mentally to speak with our lord and savior. 

We were still within the great palace when we came to a much smaller and less grand doorway. The Seraphim departed and left me alone at the door. I was a little confused. I would have thought that the doorway to the room where God resided would be the grandest thing imaginable. Instead it resembled a simple wooden door.

The door flung open and there was silence for a bit.

“Enter” came a voice from within.

I slowly walked inside and was shocked at how dark this room was compared to the rest of Heaven where I had been. It wasn’t pitch black, but the light was so much dimmer than the light outside that it could hardly be light at all. After some time of adjustment, it could be described as being the same light as what I was used to on Earth.

The room was small and very underwhelming. Yet at the same time it consisted of many things I was familiar with. It looked like an operating theater. I thought this was very strange, especially after all the extravagant things I had seen outside this room. The only unordinary thing that drew my attention was a large glass cylinder with a strange cloudy substance within it. 

Whilst I stood in curious observation of the room, I was startled by the door being shut. I turned around, only to be met by a man. Or what seemed like a man.

“Hello Timothy, would you mind lying down on that bed just there please” the man said.

This man. Was he God? Was this the being I had devoted my whole entire life to?

“Are you God?” I asked shakily as I laid upon the bed.

“To make it easier for you to understand, I am like the judge. Only a part of God. There is no need for me to go deeper than that”

Unlike the Judge, and the Angels, this being was a lot more friendlier and far less intimidating. I felt a lot more comfortable with him and trusted him completely as he scanned me and began taking measurements over my body with amazingly advanced scientific apparatus. 

“But I don’t understand. I was told that I was to seek an audience with God. Did he mean only a part of God?”

The being sighed. “Ill be honest with you Tim. You could never see God in his full form. It is simply impossible. He is all the Light and Matter in the Omniverse, condensed into a singularity. He is all of Heaven.”

The scales that this being was talking about were huge. An Omniverse? I never heard of such a thing. I assumed that it was larger than the Universe.

“So, we are currently inside God as we speak?” I said in awe

“No, because like I just said, it is impossible. We are currently just outside of Heaven, in the space between it and the Ultraverse. This is Limbo. To put it in perspective, imagine that Heaven is the Sun, and Limbo is a planet 1000 times closer than Mercury. That’s sort of what it is like.”

I was blown away by all of this. It was fascinating. And it was so refreshing to have a heavenly being willing to answer my questions for me. I was absolutely full of them.

“What is an Omniverse?” I asked while the doctor began examining my arms and hands.

“You are a curious individual, aren’t you?” he replied

“I’m just in awe at the extent of our lords creation. I knew it exceeded all expectations.” 

The Doctor smiled warmly. “You truly have strong faith. The judge was right that you are very Valuable. I guess the least you deserve, is to know a little bit more than I would tell the other souls.”

I smiled in response to the Doctor. I felt like I was at home with such a familiar being and tone of voice.

“The Omniverse is simply everything” the doctor began “Everything that could possibly ever happen, has happened and will happen in the Omniverse.”

The Doctor paused while he fastened my right arm to the bed.

“Well it used to be like that a very long time ago.”

The doctor fastened my other arm to the bed. He then kissed my brow.

“You are truly special because very few people will ever know this, so consider yourself blessed to learn what I’m about to tell you.  See, At this current point in time, there are three realities in the Omniverse. There is God; the embodiment of light and matter. There is the Ultraverse which is where you come from and was created by God to be a combination of light, matter and Darkness.”

He paused as he sighed.

“Then there is the void. The embodiment of all dark matter and dark energy. The Nemesis of God.”

“So its Lucifer?” I replied.

“Lucifer is only an Angel my dear Tim. Angels are Mice compared to the scale of the void. The Void is the purest enemy of God and the one thing that we are desperately trying to escape from”

All this information was hard for me to wrap my head around. I was always taught that Lucifer was the true enemy of God and that in time God would triumph over him. How could God be trying to escape from Something else? An existential dread started to overcome me as I continued to listen to the Doctor.

“See, the Void and God aren’t individuals. They are a civilization. Two very powerful ones at that. They are So powerful, that they evolved to simply become the embodiments of the fundamentals of the entire Omniverse. God took on the Matter and Light, while the Void took the more prominent Dark matter and Dark energy.

They started off as no more than a simple being as you Humans are. But after eons of evolution, they had advanced so far, that the civilization no longer consisted of individuals, but rather it became a single entity. A single consciousness. 

For Eons they fought, as the only two realities in the Omniverse. The Void had the upper hand all along and eventually the Void decided to spare God.”

Despite my brain being fried at hearing all of this information I needed to hear more “Why did it spare God? Wouldn’t it want to be the dominant being of the Omniverse” 

“It doesn’t want to dominate the Omniverse. Neither does God. It spared God to allow Matter and light to still exist. See, both civilizations want to leave the Omniverse. It’s the obvious next step in their evolution. They had done it before in leaving their planets, then their Galaxies, their universe, the multiverse, until now it is just the two occupying the entire Omniverse. Leaving the Omniverse would allow the victorious specie powers that cant be conceived within this Omniverse. To eliminate God, the Void would simply eliminate any chance it could have to leave the Omniverse. As long as Light, Matter and Dark exist together, new possibilities can occur.”

I tried to move into a more comfortable position but was unable to with my restrained arms. 

“But how can you be certain that there is something beyond the Omniverse?”

The Doctor continued

“String theory. See, it’s the limit of everything. The very fabric of the Omniverse. How we know that there is something beyond this? Vibrations. Small tiny vibrations, constantly occurring at irregular intervals. It is the one thing that God or the Void can not control. These Vibrations are clearly being caused by something from beyond, and that is the basis for us having the knowledge of an even higher plain of existence.”

The Doctor strapped my right leg now.

“See, God is desperate to leave the Omniverse. We want to survive. So God violated the truce with the Void and created a new set of infinite universes, which we call the Ultraverse. Within the Ultraverse contains every universe of every single possibility, constantly creating new ones every millisecond based off the slightest variations. He did this to allow for new possibilities to arise and to rewatch the evolution of his species to see if anything may have been missed in the forgotten history of our primitive forms.”

My other leg was strapped firmly to the bed.

“And who do you think the primitive form of Gods species is?” The doctor asked me.

It couldn’t be. This didn’t make sense. “Humans?” I said softly.

The Doctor clapped his hands

“YES! Humans! And Lowe and behold, we are a genius. Gods plan eventually worked, and fruit started to come out of it. The very fruit that we have been so starved of for Millenia. A way out of the Omniverse!”

My eyes lit up. This was extraordinary “How? What can we have in our current state of evolution, that your advanced people do not?”

The Doctor smiled

“The very thing that I am talking to right now”

I was confused as usual. What was he talking about? Surely I wasn’t that important. “Me?” I said.

“Your soul you fool!” the doctor spat “Souls were the missing piece of the puzzle. The piece that we ignored in our youth in pursuit of the sciences of the Omniverse. The piece that we abandoned for reason and logic. It turned out that the unreasonable, and unexplainable is the most powerful thing in the entire Omniverse.”

The doctor now strapped my head to the bed. I was beginning to feel uneasy.

“When Lucifer rebelled, he tried to sabotage Gods plan, and in the process, his Demons went down to Earth and created False ideologies. They posed as Gods that the primitive humans worshipped so devoutly. But upon dying in strong faith to these fictional “Gods” these Humans did something unexplainable. They were able to transcend death. They would wonder the Omniverse aimlessly, in search of their promised afterlife that they would never find. 

We noticed this and knew that it was a powerful thing to transcend death. We studied it, but could not understand it. 

Then along came the Hindus on Earth. All of a sudden, we were starting to see people transcend death, and not long after becoming a soul, these people would transcend the Omniverse. These Hindus had somehow found a way to transcend the Omniverse. They had the ability to get to the very place that we have so desperately been trying to get to for millennia!

But it seemed that despite how hard we tried, our logic could never conceive the idea of faith and belief in the unreasonable. We needed to find a way to learn as much as we can about the science of the Souls and to hopefully use their essence for ourselves.”

By this point I was getting extremely nervous. I tried to move but was frozen in place on the bed. The Doctor grabbed the large glass jar containing the cloudy substance and began to wheel it closer to me.

“So we began to mingle amongst the Humans ourselves, and began to test the very few who were uncorrupted by the Demons influence. That’s when we found Abraham and tested his faith. We convinced Abraham that if he believed in us, he would be given a paradise to go to upon death, and his descendants would dominate the Earth. 

Lowe and Behold, upon dying, Abraham transcended death. But he did not become a lost wandering soul. He was drawn to heaven through the same pull that brought you here. He was the first Soul to enter the “Heaven” as you had imagined it to be.

For the first time, we were able to catch the souls of the deceased who died in faith to God, and trap them in heaven where they could be studied and we could attempt to extract their essence.

We aided these descendants of Abraham, to eventually create the Jewish faith, and then when the Roman empire formed, we saw an opportunity to expand and hence was where your Christian ideas came into the picture. With the dominance of Christianity, we created another sect, Islam, so that it could conquer the East and try to counter the powerful Hindus and Buddhists who dominated those lands. At this very point in time, the world as you know it is dominated by the believers of the Abrahamic faiths. All of whom will end up here when they die. Devout worshipers such as yourself”

The doctor was now right on top of me and placed a tube that came out of the glass jar onto my chest. I was in a struggle and fought franticly to restrain myself but I was unable to be set free. 

“I’m afraid this is where the information ends Tim. Your sacrifice will mean a great deal in the grand scheme of things, and your devotion to God is greatly appreciated”

“Where’s Mariell!” I shouted “I want to see My wife!” I kept on shaking but was unable to get anywhere.

“She is gone Tim! She did her duty for us!” The doctor yelled, getting frustrated with my struggling. 

Tears rushed down my eyes as I screamed in denial. This was not happening. This was surely not Heaven. I must be in Hell!

“Gracie! Oh Gracie! I am so sorry!” I shouted in pain and sorrow as the Doctor placed the tube on my chest and switched on a button that caused a huge suction.

I was in a mess, and I couldn’t do anything. I looked into the glass Jar and knew that my wife and likely my daughters remains of a soul were part of that cloud. I had truly failed them!

My mind was in such a mess with what was happening that I barely noticed the Doctor fall on top of me, and the glass jar being broken.

“The Liberator! You are brave to come so close to Heaven!” The doctor shouted as an unknown figure stood over him.

The doctor struggled, and stood back up to fight the figure, but he was quickly overpowered by the being and shot through the roof of the room in a massive surge of light.

Immediately, a number of other beings flooded into the room and hastily undid the straps that I was tied in with. I was in too much of a delirium to make sense of what was happening, and I felt myself being carried away by these people.

All that went through my mind at this time was the fates of my poor wife and daughter. I was in so much denial of the truth  I had been told. It couldn’t be right. Surely, I didn’t dedicate my whole life to a lie.

No words can explain the sheer terror i was experiencing.  Even now, as I write this, my fingers shake as I relive the moment making it hard for me to continue.
 I think I'll pause here for now, and when I regain my composure I'll continue where I left off. Sorry.

Man, some memories are just better left forgotten.
