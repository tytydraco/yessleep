I came here to end it. Remote cabin. No signal. One key. One bottle. 


I didn’t leave a note. Didn’t want anyone to try and understand.


I took the pills on the bed. The world closed in like a tide that finally got high enough to cover me. I remember the quiet. The stillness. The certainty.


Then I woke up.


Same room. Same body. Same clothes.
But the bottle was gone. 


At first, I thought maybe I hadn’t taken them. That I passed out too early. That I hallucinated it. 


But the bottle was gone, the room was spotless, the sheets were made, the lights were on. 


And the door had no handle.


There’s food. Not good food: neutral food. No smell. No seasoning. Just enough. It appears silently on a tray at the base of the wall twice a day. I tried to skip it. Passed out. Woke up clean and full.


The lights don’t have switches. The room brightens and dims on its own. Sometimes it mimics sunlight through drawn curtains. Sometimes it’s cloudy. But there are no windows.


Everything resets. I tear the sheets, they’re whole again. I scratch the walls, then they’re smooth. I screamed for hours once. My voice didn’t echo,I just felt small.


The silence here isn’t emptiness. It’s pressure.
There’s a screen on one wall. It was blank for a long time. Then one day, I asked aloud, “What is this place?”


It lit up. White text, centered:
“You chose this.”


It never answered follow-ups. I tried. I begged. Sometimes I cursed it. The screen stayed dark.
After a while, I stopped asking.


I began watching patterns. The way the lights shifted. The intervals between meals. The texture of the water. I thought maybe I could break it by seeing through it.


But nothing changes. Or maybe everything does, just so slowly that I can’t tell. My fingernails grow. I think. My hair feels longer. Or maybe I just forgot how short it used to be.


Once, I bit my tongue hard enough to taste blood. It felt real. Sharp. But when I checked the mirror, there was nothing.


Eventually, the room stopped feeling like a room. It started feeling like a pause. Like everything else had continued without me, and this space was where my life had been put on hold.


Sometimes I think I hear things. Far off. A chime. A low tone. Once, something that might have been a voice.
It never lasts.


Today, the screen came back.
Not in response to anything. Not because I spoke.
Just lit up on its own.


“Do you want to live now?”
Two boxes:
YES
NO


I laughed. The kind of laugh that empties itself before it gets out. Then I tapped NO. Nothing happened.


I tapped YES.
More of the same.


The screen blinked off. The tray appeared with a meal I didn’t ask for. The light shifted into a warm amber. The sheets on the bed were crisp again. The toothbrush was replaced. Identical.


I sat in the corner. Counted my breaths until I lost track. Counted again. Considered every anxiety I've ever had. Counted my breaths again. 


At some point, I heard it. Soft. Distant. A sound I hadn’t heard before.


A beeping tone. Steady. Flat. Like something clinical.
Then silence.
Then another tone. Fainter. A pause. Then nothing.


It felt like someone was trying to measure me. Trying to find me.
From just outside the room, like I was hearing someone speak from underwater:

*I love you, baby. Forever.*
Then, nothing. 


This isn’t peace.
This is a moment stretched thin. A single choice sealing life like amber.
I didn’t survive.
Not really.


And now I live in the shape of the thing I can’t unchoose, alive enough to regret it.
