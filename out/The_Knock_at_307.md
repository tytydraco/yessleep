It was supposed to be just another night in my quiet, small-town home. I work late hours at a 24/7 diner, so I often get back around 2:30 a.m., exhausted but too wired to sleep right away. My routine usually involves unwinding with a cold beer and some mindless TV until I feel the drowsiness kick in. But that night, something different happened—something that still makes my skin crawl every time I think about it.

It was exactly 3:07 a.m. when I heard the first knock. It was soft, almost polite, like someone was testing the waters to see if anyone was home. My initial thought was that it was probably one of my neighbors needing something, maybe even drunk and at the wrong door. But when I looked through the peephole, there was no one there. Just the dark, empty street, illuminated by the occasional flicker of the old streetlamp out front.

I waited a moment, expecting another knock, but the silence that followed was suffocating. I shook it off, blaming it on my overactive imagination fueled by sleep deprivation. Just as I sat back down on the couch, the knock came again—this time, louder and more insistent.

I jumped to my feet, the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end. I don’t scare easily, but something about this felt off. I checked the peephole again, my heart pounding in my chest. Still nothing. The street was completely deserted.

But then, I noticed something—a shadow. It was faint, barely visible, but definitely there, standing just out of the range of the streetlight. I couldn’t make out any features, just a dark silhouette. I called out, asking who was there, but got no response. Just the stillness of the night.

I decided to open the door, just a crack, to get a better look. As soon as the door was ajar, a gust of cold air rushed in, making me shiver. The shadow was gone. I stepped out onto the porch, looking around, but there was no sign of anyone. The street was completely silent, save for the rustling of leaves in the wind.

I went back inside, locking the door behind me, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. I decided to call it a night and head to bed, but as I turned off the TV, the knocking started again. This time, it was relentless, pounding against the door like someone was trying to break it down.

I raced back to the door, fear and adrenaline coursing through me, but when I looked through the peephole, there was nothing but that same empty street. The knocking continued, louder and louder, echoing through the house. It was impossible—it felt like the sound was coming from inside my skull.

I swung the door open, shouting for whoever it was to leave me the hell alone, but the moment the door opened, the knocking stopped. The silence was deafening. I stood there, my breath coming in ragged gasps, staring out into the night.

And then, I saw it.

A figure, standing at the edge of my driveway, just beyond the reach of the streetlight. It was tall and thin, with long, spindly limbs that seemed to stretch unnaturally. Its head was tilted at an odd angle, as if it was trying to peer into my soul. The air around it seemed to distort, like heat waves rising from asphalt on a hot day.

I was frozen in place, unable to move or even blink. The figure slowly raised one of its long arms and pointed directly at me. I felt a sudden, overwhelming urge to run, but my legs wouldn’t cooperate. It started to move toward me, its limbs bending and twisting in ways that defied logic.

Finally, I snapped out of my paralysis and slammed the door shut, bolting it as fast as I could. I backed away from the door, my heart racing, expecting it to burst open at any moment. But the knocking never came. There was only silence.

I didn’t sleep that night. I sat in the corner of my bedroom with a baseball bat clutched in my hands, waiting for something—anything. But the figure never returned. When the sun finally rose, I cautiously opened the door and stepped outside. The street was as it always was—quiet and empty, with no sign of the figure.

I’ve tried to rationalize it, telling myself it was just a nightmare or a hallucination brought on by exhaustion. But deep down, I know what I saw. I’ve moved since then, far away from that house, but sometimes, late at night, I still hear the knocking. Soft at first, then louder, until it’s pounding in my skull.

And I know, one day, I won’t be able to resist opening that door again.
