Chapter 1: Binu, football, and the hanging whore.

As soon as evening falls, the mosquitoes swarm in. The buzzing is like a continuous whine. No matter how much one thrashes around, they don’t go away. The goalkeeper’s struggle is real. He has to guard the goal – can’t move much.

A sharp slap in the air misses its mark, and the hand moves from the shin to the cheek, from the cheek to the neck. No one wants to stand in goal because of these mosquitoes.
The sour stench from the drain beside the ground rises in waves. 
The game is in a mess. Boys fight over goals. They slip and fall in the muddy water.

Today, even before the sunset, the boys have turned into dark shadows. It’s getting harder to see the ball. Weather forecast says Phani* will hit. 

From the Dutta household, the sound of a conch shell* echoes. A gust of wind rushes in. The old mango tree’s worm-eaten leaves rustle like a dying whisper — mor, mor, mor.*

That’s the tree where Bubun’s youngest aunt had hanged herself. Binu saw her corpse. She said her tongue had dangled near her breasts, and her eyes had almost popped out of their sockets.

As the damp evening creeps in, Bubun’s mom yells out from their rooftop, “Bubun, you son of a bitch, will you come inside or not? If I tell your fucking dad today, he will beat the life out of you…”

Kicking the ball far away from us, Bubun runs home.

Chhotu, a high schooler, slips behind the white wall, lights a joint, and signals others with his hand. Looking around carefully, Sayan, Tapu, and Jacky follow him. One by one, they all vanish into the darkness.

On the whitewashed wall, there’s a large painting of Goddess Kali. Her tongue is blood-red.

The empty ground gets draped in a bluish sheet of darkness. In the sky, clouds swim like clumps of black jamun.*

Under the old mango tree, in the grainy darkness, the football’s white skin gleams faintly. By the edge of the ground, the four of us sit in a circle — I, Biltu, Babai, and Binu.

"They still leave food on Sundays… in the evening… after everyone leaves the ground." Binu whispers, "I've seen it. That whore loved eating mutton. They leave a brass plate there - mutton, rice, and crispy fried Amudi fish…"*

Our three pairs of eyes follow Binu’s pointing finger. We scan the musty darkness beneath the old mango tree with disbelief and fear.

"Who leaves it? I mean, who puts it there? Bubun’s dad?" I ask in a hushed voice.

"Bubun’s uncle. Sometimes his dad. They don’t wait after putting the plate down. They grip their sacred thread* and mutter prayers, walking straight home. It seems like walking, but you know how people walk when they are afraid – more like running." Binu grins. Her white set of teeth flashes in the dark.

Babai swallows hard, "W-why? Why do they run?" 

Binu slowly faces Babai. She grabs my wrist with her strangely cold palm. Her sharp eyes scan the old tree, searching for something.
My spine tingles.

In a low voice, Binu says, "When someone dies an unnatural death… you know what they become... do they still belong to anyone?" The darkness thickens. Mosquitoes buzz near my ears. Binu pauses for a moment.

Faint sound of conch shells blowing can be heard from distant houses.

"Then there's insatiable hunger. Just hunger. The purest of instincts. What will you do if the whore finishes off the food and still wants more? Then what? Who's a father, who's a brother? That's why they run away in a haste... She climbs down the tree, pounces on the plate, and devours it all…"

Boltu licks his lips and scoffs, "You fucking liar. How do you come up with such nonsense? Doesn’t anyone in your our family beat you for this? Lying bitch..."

Binu turns to him, her voice dry. "I say it because I’ve seen it. Want to see for yourself? She climbs down like a squirrel — on all fours, gliding down the trunk. Completely naked. She was fair-skinned, so even in the dark, her limbs gleam. Hair down to her waist - if she stands up. Do you want to see her, Boltu? Want to stay a little longer? They will bring the food soon. Let's stand behind the bush near the big tree… We won’t have to wait long... The witch doesn't take long to come down..."

Boltu jumps to his feet. He nudges Babai with his toe, and says, "Hey, let's go home... You don't want to miss the match, do you? KKR* plays tonight..."

Babai scrambles up, "Yeah, yeah, let’s go! We’ll be late!"

Binu smirks. "The match will start at 7:30... It’s not even six yet. Why are you in a hurry? Are you scared? If we stand behind the bush, we’ll see everything…"

"I’m not scared. I just don’t believe in this nonsense," Babai snarls.
"Anyway..." he adds,  "My tutor will be there soon — we have to study. We are not like you Binu; no books, no schoolwork. Just chasing boys all day. You can't keep your hands off boys, can you? We have better things to do than stand in a bush and get bitten by mosquitoes."

Binu grins crookedly and says, "It would be a good chance for you to run your hands over my breasts and tummy. Like you always do..."

There is no reply. They slip on their flip-flops and head towards the alley at the northern end of the ground.

A gust of wind blows. A stray plastic packet clings to my arm. As I shake it off, I yell, "Hey, get the ball before you leave!" But they’re already gone.

Binu stands up and stretches out a hand towards me. I grab her hand and pull myself up, muttering, "See how they all ran away? And now I have to get the ball. If the ball gets stolen, the high-schoolers will kill me. The last one in the ground always gets stuck with the blame."

"Get the ball. What's the problem?" Binu shrugs.

I freeze. I glance at the old mango tree, then at Binu. The darkness under the tree is unsettling. What if something is lurking there. Binu's eyes gleam in the shallow darkness.

Above us, something flies past with a loud flapping noise. I shudder. 

Binu says, "A heron… Its chicks must’ve been killed by crows. That’s why it’s flying so low, crying for help… Go get the ball."

I swallow. "I can’t, Binu. What if it climbs down the tree a-and gets me...?"

Binu laughs silently.

"Come. Hold my hand." I touch her soft palm.

Together, we walk towards the base of the tree. Binu strides confidently. I hesitate. The dense canopy of the mango tree blocks the last faint light. Something caws hoarsely from above.

I, with a hammering palpitation, stoop down to pick up the football.
I hold my breath - What if I stand up and see something face to face? Binu taps my shoulder lightly. She points at the tree trunk.

Scattered around the roots there are scraps of meat, grains of rice. Binu’s finger moves slightly higher. On the bark of that old-tree — I see footprints. Small. Feminine.

Someone has walked straight up the tree! Those footprints are marked in altah (red dye).*
A shiver runs down my spine.

"Binu…!" I mutter out, nervously.

A gust of wind whips through, rustling everything. From the trees, a sobbing sound rises. The shadows seem to stir - they have come alive. 

Something crouches on the branch above us. A shadowy figure, perhaps of a young woman, squatting on a hanging branch of that old-mango tree.

Binu grips my arm and yanks me forward. Ball under my arm, slippers in hand, our feet race against the wind.

Chapter 2: Raindrops on Binu's neck, Ratan's old granny, blood-red hibiscus.

The rain has started. It drizzles on. Under the old tin shade of the alleyway, the dim, yellow lamps stare at us like cataract-clouded eyes.

I pull out the thorny burrs stuck to my pants and flick them away. I glance at Binu.

Binu is walking, head down, hands buried in the pockets of her half-pants, humming a Bollywood number under her breath. Her wet legs glisten — smooth, hairless.
My heart is still pounding. But Binu remains unflinched. By the dark gate of fishmonger Ratan’s house, two bicycles stand side by side, drenched in the rain.

Just inside the door, Ratan's old grandma lies on a thin mattress. The rain sprays in. She croaks out, “Ratan reee… O Ratan… I feel cold, son…”

I steal another uneasy glance at Binu. Her short hair brushes her neck. Tiny raindrops shine on her smooth skin like pearls. Blood rushes to my ears. She has a wild charm. The sweet musky fragrance of her body makes me fall for her everyday.

Under the streetlight, she seems like someone from a distant world. “Binu? Why are we taking a detour? What if the cyclone hits?” She doesn’t reply. Then, stopping her humming, she suddenly asks, “You know Uncle Ratan, right? The fishmonger..."

I nod. “Hmm.” 

- “Uncle Ratan has a wooden leg.”

- “I know. He lost it in a train accident —”

- “Who told you?”

- “I know. He fell while crossing the tracks. People say he was piss drunk.”

- “Bullshit. People talk nonsense. Uncle Ratan never drank back then. It was Gour the mason who called him.” There is a grim look on Binu's face.

- “Binu, I’m telling you, I don’t like this. You know I get spooked. Stop picking on me..."

And I'm not ashamed to admit that. It’s pretty normal to be scared. I’ve heard the story since I was born. Gour the mason was run over by a train. That was at least twenty years ago. Now Binu says that train-mangled Gour has eaten a leg of a man. Why won't I be scared?

Rainwater drips from the tiled roofs of the filthy cattle shed. Inside, the black buffaloes chew lazily. 

The mix of rain and dung has made the stench unbearable. The alley narrows. There’s no one around. Ignoring me completely, Binu reaches out, plucks a blood-red hibiscus from a nearby bush, and says, “Then listen how Ratan Kaka’s leg ended up getting eaten by Gour the mason...”



Chapter 3: Binu continues.

Ratan Kaka drinks now. He didn’t before.

When the younger men of the neighbourhood of Ratan Kaka’s age used to drink late at night, play cards, and create a ruckus, Ratan’s nights were different.

He would be in bed by nine to wake up at 3:45. He used to hang the huge aluminium cauldrons on his bicycle, cross the railway gate, and go to fetch fish. The trucks unloaded sea-fish at dawn near Sat-ghara. Remember when you went there last year for a football match? That's the place.

Small fish sellers go there and buy fish to sell in the town market. His routine never changed, not once throughout the year.

That year, it was monsoon. Some roads were muddy, some had stone slabs. Ratan woke up before dawn as always. While shitting, he could hear the loud croaking of frogs in the swamp behind his house.

He was newly married to Bubun’s youngest aunt — against the family’s wishes. Bubun’s family were Brahmans. Ratan? He sold fish. Who knew what caste he was? So her family was not willing.

He told his wife, “I'm heading out. Shut the door. Don’t open it till the sun comes out. And hey! You’re still not wearing your blouse? My dad will be up any moment now! Don't come out baring your breats...”

The front yard was narrow and shadowy. Dense shrubs lined the path. Even in the daytime, cicadas chirped there.

Just as he was about to take his cycle and leave — khop! Something grabbed his left leg.

He almost toppled over but steadied himself. Looking down, he saw it was the old grandma.
Yes, the same one we just saw.
She was ancient even back then, and crazy - like batshit crazy.

She had been lying near the door for years, through summers, winters, and rains, wrapped in a thin quilt.

No one took her inside. The old hag never died. People said her sins were too heavy to escape suffering so easily.

Ratan was annoyed. He said, “What is it now? I’m leaving.”

The old woman’s voice cracked, “Don’t go today, son. Just for today, don’t go...”

Drizzle had started. Ratan’s dry clothes began soaking in the rain. His temper flared.

He shouted, “And who’s going to bring money home, huh? Who’s going to earn for the household while you keep stuffing flatbread down your throat?”

The grandmother’s frail voice pleaded, “Don’t go, son. Gour stood by the hibiscus tree all night. Please, don’t go today..."

Ratan gritted his teeth. “Oh? The train-mangled Gour was standing under the tree? His ghost was plucking flowers for your wedding bed, was he? Why didn’t he take you along with him, then? Old fucking bitch...”

Ratan set off. The old woman kept shouting in her broken voice. A plastic sheet was tied to Ratan's head, as carrying an umbrella would make cycling difficult.

The hibiscus leaf brushed against Ratan's hand. He smiled to himself. The old woman had gone completely insane.

As he reached the marshland, Ratan slowed down. He hesitated. A pond had overflowed. The marshland, the football ground, and the pond had merged into one. This was a big problem. 

Before the railway gate, nearly half a mile of road was under waist-deep water. The sky was thick with many folded clouds. That’s why the dim morning light seemed even duller today.

Getting off his cycle, Ratan rolled up his pants and pushed forward through the water, cursing his fate. The aluminum pots hanging from his cycle floated on the water. The current towards the pond was strong.

Small whirlpools swirled here and there. Ratan knew these roads like the back of his hand. If it were someone else, they would have drowned by now.

As he reached the crooked peetuli tree near the pond, a flash of lightning tore across the sky. In that brief glow, Ratan saw a man wading through the water about ten feet ahead.

"Who the fuck could be here at this hour?" he thought.

A deep, rumbling sound echoed from the sky. Soaking in sweat and rain, Ratan kept pushing through the water. After five to seven minutes, he finally reached the raised slab road near the railway gate and sighed in relief.

As he pressed the pedal again, he saw the man again in the dim light ahead. The man was shirtless, wearing black pants. He walked towards the railway crossing.
Steering carefully past the potholes, Ratan cycled toward the gate. The road sloped down on both sides into the marshlands, thick with bushes.

Suddenly, with a loud crack, a large branch from a nearby tree broke and fell onto the road, startling Ratan. It was a fresh branch, not a rotten or dry one. Ratan looked up — The man was gone.

There was no alley nearby where he could have disappeared. Had the man stepped into the field, he should have been visible. Had he vanished? Who cares?

A couple of minutes later, Ratan spotted the railway gate in the distance. And there was the man again, walking steadily towards the gate. As Ratan got within ten feet, the man slipped past the gate and stepped onto the railway tracks.
Ratan was confused. He stopped his cycle at the gate.

The man stood motionless on the tracks, facing the direction of the oncoming train.

"What the fuck? Is he crazy or what?"

The rain hadn't started pouring yet — just a heavy drizzle. The air was thick and misty. Ratan's wet clothes stuck to his body. As he tried to squeeze his cycle under the gate, he heard the train's loud horn and looked up.

The bright headlights of the first local train pierced through the rain-blurred haze. Ratan became alert. The man was still standing there.

"Hey man! Move!" Ratan shouted. 

No reaction.

"Are you trying to kill yourself, you fucking fool?"

Ratan left his cycle there and scrambled under the railway gate.
A drongo bird with a forked tail sat on the overhead wires, getting drenched in the rain.

Ratan hurried toward the man. "Hey, are you deaf or what? Move!"

The man started walking. The train's headlights grew sharper. Ratan struggled to keep his balance on the wet railway stones, but he kept following the man. He was determined — he couldn't let that man die.

The man walked smoothly on the tracks, heading straight toward the train. The horn blared again. The engine's roar was deafening now.
Ratan, in a trance, kept following the man.

"Move, damn it! Move, I'm telling you!"

A mangy black dog sat beside the railway track, staring at Ratan. Someone called his name from afar —
"R-A-A-T-A-A-N…"

Ratan had no sense of himself anymore. The train was just two hundred meters away.

The man suddenly stopped. Ratan lunged forward and grabbed his bare shoulder.

The man turned towards him.
A familiar face. Terribly familiar.
Ratan had seen his very corpse lying beside the railway tracks ten years ago. On a morning just like this. His belly was slit open. Jackals tearing at his guts.

The train was now a hundred meters away.

It was Gaur the mason. His round, unblinking eyes stared at Ratan.
The dog began howling.

A monstrous grin spread across Gour's face, ear to ear. From his gaping stomach, tangled intestines were prominent.

Ratan’s head spun.

"R-A-A-T-A-A-N…" Someone shouted again.

As he snapped back to reality, the train's engine was right in front of his face. Someone shoved Ratan hard on the shoulder to move him off the railway tracks.

The mangy mongrel barked wildly.

A sharp pain shot through Ratan's left knee. Darkness clouded his vision.

The drongo bird on the overhead wire flew away.


Chapter 4: Binu's story scares the shit out of me, the shabby household, the darkness under the stairs.


Finishing her story, Binu looks at me. Soaked in the rain, my hands and feet feel like ice.

Binu asks, "Hey, wanna have some tea? Come inside."

I stand frozen. Binu’s neighbourhood is lined with weathered houses crouching along the narrow alley. Moss-covered courtyards, dark ancient wells, and the crooked doors seem to be staring at me.

I swallow hard.

Binu smiles, "Come on, don’t worry. I’ll walk you home."

As rain water pooled in Binu’s front yard, they have made a makeshift path of green moss covered broken bricks.

Stepping on the bricks rising over water Binu walks ahead. I follow her.

All around the yard, the shabby houses of their kins stood in silence.

In one of the rooms to the left, I could hear someone listening to the static-filled tune of an old radio. Frogs croaked in unison. 

From a thatched house at the far end, a child's voice recited monotonously:

"The damp stands in the long green grass,
As thick as morning's tears…"

We step into the entrance of the part where Binu lives. There is a  musty darkness under the stairs.

I grab Binu’s arm.

Binu stops, turns and comes closer. Leaning towards me, she whispers, her lips near my lips, “That’s how Gour the mason ate Uncle Ratan’s leg. If he hadn’t been pushed away, Gour would have taken all of him.”

I can feel Binu’s breath against my face. There is a sudden rush of heat through my body. We stand belly to belly.

I ask, “How do you know all this? Who saved Uncle Ratan?”

Binu presses me against the damp wall of the staircase.

Her lips almost touching mine, she whispers, “My dad was the railway gatekeeper then. At that very crossing. He was the one who shoved Ratan off the tracks."

Binu pulls away from me, and starts climbing the stairs.

Outside, the rain starts roaring against the tin roofs.

Two steps up, she suddenly stops and turns around. A small oil lamp flickers on a wooden rack by the stairwell.

One of Binu’s eyes glows red in the lamp’s light. The other remains in darkness. A gecko clicks from above.

I shudder.

In a dry voice, Binu says, “The next monsoon, my father wasn’t so lucky as Ratan… Gour the mason ate all of him...”

“Binu… no...”

Binu smiles and whispers, “Why? Don't you want to hear more?”
