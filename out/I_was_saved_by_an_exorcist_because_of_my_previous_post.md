As you all know, I have not been able to sleep recently. For those who don't I will do my best to sum up what happened to me last week, which led up to tonight. Last week I was watching my grandparents house while they were on vacation. When I would fall asleep I would use an app that would record my sleep patterns and alert me to any irregularities. Throughout my stay the app recorded the audio of footsteps from outside my door, and weird happenings around the house. I wrote them off as my mind playing tricks on me, attempting to not give into the stories mom told me about a seance she had as a kid, but it became impossible to ignore when a voice whispered into the app that it wanted me. I left the house, hoping to leave the spirit, or whatever it was behind only to have it follow me to my house. SInce then I have deleted the sleep analysis app and avoided sleeping within my house.

Up until recently almost all of the hauntings had waited for me to fall asleep. My response was to spend some nights at friends' houses and only hang around my house during the day. My house is a two story, with an unfinished basement. It's less grand than my grandparents with only two rooms and two bathrooms, however it is comfortable enough to call home. 

Two days ago I got an email from a local exorcist claiming he could help me solve my spiritual problem. I ignored it however as someone trying to exploit my situation for fame of some sort. I was content with trying to find logical explanations for the hauntings, especially since while I stayed in my house during the day nothing seemingly happened. That was until yesterday when I was cleaning out my room, and I swore someone was following me. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a shadow that was not my own, and I felt as if my room had gotten ten degrees cooler. My brain had yet to comprehend I was the only person supposed to be in my house so I didn't even turn my head, I simply said "Dad, when did you get here?"

After a moment it finally clicked, it was a friday and my dad was at work. He didn't have time to drive all the way to my house for a midday visit. When I realized the shadow I had seen was not someone I knew I quickly spun to confront it, however when I was face to face with where the shadow had been nothing was there, and the feeling of warmth had returned to the house.

I know it's silly that after everything I had been through, this was the final straw, but I sent a response back to the priest. I sent him my address along with an explanation of what had occurred earlier in the day. He was eager to respond and requested to come over later for a reading of the house. I agreed, hesitant to stay after the sun had gone down.

Just as the sun had begun to set his old beater of a car pulled into the driveway. I don't know what I would expect a priest to drive considering they don't get the greatest salaries, however I assumed that it would be a nicer vehicle.  He seemed young for a priest, only in his mid twenties, but he had a face that also seemed scarred as if he had experienced his fair share of hardships.

I invited him in and we sat in my living room, turning the tv on for some light background noise. We began discussing my history and when the hauntings began. I couldn't give him an answer as I did not know whether the spirit was connected to my mom's supposed seance or not. After some talk he toured around the house. If we'd played poker he would mop the floor with me, as his face did not betray any emotion. It wasn't until the end of the tour that he finally spoke.

"Something dark has manifested here, you need an exorcism." His face had yet to falter.

"An exorcism?" I responded, still slightly skeptical that the explanation to everything was supernatural and not simply insanity on my part.

"Something dark has attached itself to you. It leeches off of your energy, and by not sleeping well you're making its job easier." He spoke matter of factly as if this were a normal occurrence for him. He then reached into a small satchel he had been carrying with him and pulled out what he explained was a stick of incense.

"What is that for?" I questioned. "You need more for an exorcism right?"

He chuckled. "I am preparing for an exorcism son. That will not occur until tomorrow night, however a cleansing must be done now." He proceeded to enter every room in the house spreading the incense around. Once he was finished I walked him to the door where he gave me a blessing and handed me a list. "I need you to do all of this before I arrive tomorrow."

I looked over the list, it consisted of seven requirements.

1. Collect valuables for donation.

2. Say a prayer admitting obedience to god.

3. Wait 30 minutes in the room you believe the hauntings are occurring in.

4. Do not engage in any lustful actions while within the house.

5. Fast prior to the exorcism

6. Remain calm, avoid anything that may anger you.

7. Hang crosses in every room

I couldn't wrap my head around what the list meant, but I knew it was in my best interest. It was late so I decided to leave for the night and come back in the morning so I locked the front door and went to my friends house for one last night and awoke at eight, ensuring that I was back home by ten. 

When I arrived at the house this morning I inserted the key into the lock, however when the key turned I didn't hear a click. My door was unlocked. This was alarming as I slowly opened the door and creeped into the house, I eventually realized that nothing or no one had broken in, I was being invited back in. My nerves were a wreck as I entered realizing that whatever was haunting me wanted me to come back to the house.

I settled my nerves and got to work on the list working my way from the top to bottom. Charity shouldn't be that hard to complete. I went through my closet looking through my clothes deciding which ones I should give away to charity. I will admit I at first thought about only donating crappy beat up clothes, but decided to throw in a mix of nice newer clothes and some older ones that did not fit me anymore. I then scheduled for the clothes to be picked up the following morning.

Next on the list was a prayer of obedience, I knocked that out of the way quickly. Then I had to search deep within myself to determine where the hotspot for all paranormal activity was occurring. I determined that my room seemed to be the center of it all. So I sat on the bed and set my timer for half an hour. During the time sitting I heard a couple of noises downstairs, but I steeled my resolve and stayed in place. Once I returned downstairs I noticed the door to my basement was open.

I know I should have gone down and investigated but my gut told me that was dangerous, so I decided to ignore the basement until it came time to hang the crosses on the walls. As I looked over the list I realized that time was sooner rather than later. Everything else was simply instructions on what not to do, with the last action required being to hang the crosses in every room. I decided to work my way from the top of the house to the bottom, in hopes that whatever was down there would disappear by the time I had gotten to the basement.

I went from room to room on the second floor hanging the crosses onto my walls. Once I had completed the second floor I began working on the first floor which took slightly more time as I had trouble determining what constituted a room in the open layout of the first floor. I had decided that I should be safe and put more crosses on the walls than what was probably required. Looking back however I may have done that simply to delay the inevitable of having to enter the basement.

As I got to the door I swallowed, I swore I felt my heartbeat in my ears. I worked up the courage and walked down the stairs. The basement only consisted of three rooms so I wouldn't have to spend much time down there. I worked my way from room to room, feeling a pair of eyes watching me. As I maneuvered my way through the basement it felt as though there was something right beside me at all times, the only thing was I couldn't see it. 

After I had hung the third cross in the basement I ran up the stairs two steps at a time. I then decided to leave the house and not return until it was time for the exorcism. 

When I had returned to the house I sat in my car for ten minutes, waiting for the priest to arrive. When he did I greeted him and we entered the house, only to find that the crosses on the first floor were all lying on the floor. I looked at the priest, clearly shaken by what I had witnessed. 

"Let's check the other floor." He waved at me to follow. As we went to the second floor the situation was the same as the first floor. He then turned to me and asked "Did you hang any in the basement?"

I hesitated before nodding in response. Even with his presence the basement didn't feel safe. 

"No need to check the basement, we can guess what it's like down there." He replied. His words seemed to lift a weight off of my shoulders. "On the bright side I think I know what we are dealing with."

"Really? What is it" I excitedly asked. Hoping that the knowledge he provided would free me from the torment I had been through this last week.

"Well each of the rules I made for you represented one of the seven heavenly virtues. Each of which is in direct opposition of the seven deadly sins. The crosses were for diligence, and by attacking the crosses the demon has revealed itself to be an envoy for Belphegor, the sin of sloth. That would explain why most of the happenings occurred while you were asleep." He took out a notepad and began writing.

"So what does that mean?" I asked, wondering how the knowledge would solve our current situation.

"Well this demon is clearly not Belphegor himself, what you're dealing with is an Epiales." He went on to explain that Epiales are demonic manifestations that use dreams to manifest and possess either property or people. They live to serve Belphegor and hope to eventually drive enough people to insanity. If enough people fall to their tricks then Belphegor will be able to manifest on earth. "However, now that it knows I am here for an exorcism it will give up on it's insanity attempts, now it may try and kill us as retaliation." 

I don't know why but I didn't feel afraid anymore. I was ready for everything to be over, whether successful or not this nightmare would be over. I looked him and told him "Well let's begin. The sooner this is over the better for the both of us."

He nodded, beginning his Latin chant. Surprisingly the exorcism went on without a hitch. Once it was over the aura of the house drastically changed. I couldn't believe how well it had worked, I was finally going to be able to sleep at night. I had thanked the priest and sent him on his way. I couldn't help but wonder, if one was able to manifest and target me, what stops another one from manifesting?
