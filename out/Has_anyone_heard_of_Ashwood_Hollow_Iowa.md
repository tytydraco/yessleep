As the title suggests, I’m looking for Ashwood Hollow, Iowa. I grew up there. It’s a small unincorporated town a good hour and a half from the nearest bigger city. By ‘bigger city’ I mean one with a Walmart.

Ashwood Hollow didn’t have much going for it when I was growing up. Mostly farmers who congregated together during the Great Depression to try to commune life their way out of poverty. Didn’t really work. Kept kicking though. Until recently, it seems.

Summer break was coming up soon, and I decided to go visit my family. It’s a long drive from Columbia to Ashwood Hollow so I planned on leaving first thing after my finals. But when I had my Tacoma packed and filled up with gas, something strange happened.

My phone’s GPS wouldn’t navigate to Ashwood Hollow. At first, I just assumed it was my reception, so I got out of my truck and walked back into my dorm to use the WiFi. My roommate, Mike, sat at his desk playing some shooter game I didn’t care to pay attention to.

“You’re back early,” He mutters, flicking his mouse across his mousepad.

“Haven’t left yet.” I reply my eyes fixed on my phone screen that still reads ‘unable to locate’, “Mind if I look something up on your computer for a sec? My phone is acting up.”

“Sure,” Mike says unenthusiastically.

He alt-tabs out of his game and gets out of his chair. I type ‘Ashwood Hollow, Iowa’ into the search bar, hoping to just click on directions and print it out. But when the screen loads on the slow school internet, Ashwood Hollow is nowhere to be found. Instead, there’s just some Iowa Department of Natural Resources website talking about some park.

“What the heck...” I mutter under my breath.

I glance back at Mike, who looks puzzled. He leans closer to the monitor and lets out a soundless chuckle, “Bro, why are you going to Iowa? I thought you were going home.”

“I am going home. I’m from Iowa. Do you not remember?” I rise out of his chair, giving the computer back to Mike.

“You said you were from California, dude,” Mike argues, taking a seat back in his chair.

“No, no. I’m pretty sure I told you I’m from Iowa.” I mutter, glancing back at my phone with the ‘unable to locate’ still displayed, almost taunting me.

“Whatever. It’s not that deep.” Mike tabs back into his game, leaving myself and Ashwood Hollow behind.

I stare at Mike for just a moment. I could have sworn I put down my hometown in that stupid ‘ice breaker’ that the RA made my entire hall do. That’s how I found out that the guy who lives in 1304 is from Iowa, too. I guess it wouldn’t hurt to ask him if he happens to know which exit I need to take to get to Ashwood Hollow. I know the rest of the way there if I can just get to that dang exit.

I push out into the hall, nearly bumping into Sarah, the librarian’s assistant, as she was heading towards the exit. I quickly apologize and slip past her towards 1304. I bang on the door pretty loudly because if I remember correctly, the guy usually listens to loud music.

After a few moments, the door creaks open revealing Ryan’s pale face. He doesn’t seem too thrilled to see me.

“What do you need, Parker?” he grumbles.

“Hey, sorry to bother you… Wait did I wake you up?”

“Yes,” He groans.

“Oh. Sorry. Anyway, You’re from Iowa, right?”

“Yeah, why?”

“You know where Ashwood Hollow is?”

Ryan looks confused, almost annoyed, “No? Are you talking about that reserve or whatever? I think it’s called Green Hollow. Why do you want to know anyway? I thought you were going back to California for summer break.”

“What? I was going back to Iowa to see my family.”

“Whatever. No, I don’t know where that stupid town is. Now can you let me go back to sleep?”

“Sure,” I grumble, glancing down the hall at the door leading out to campus.

I step out of the dorms and into the sunlight. Maybe the library has some of those old paper maps I can read. At this point, I’m just desperate to prove I’m not insane. I know Ashwood Hollow is real. I grew up there! Every summer day spent at the creek, every winter bundled up in our little house – twenty years of my life were in that town. My parents were born and raised there, and our hotel, the centerpiece of my entire childhood… How could it disappear like this? I get it’s a small town and we don’t get much tourism, but to remove it off the internet is a bit of a stretch.

I dial my mom’s phone to tell her I’m going to be late coming home, but I got the ‘call could not be completed’ message. Confused, I try calling my dad. Same thing. My sister. Same thing. I even try calling my family’s hotel. Call could not be completed.

A knot begins to form in my stomach, tightening with each failed call. Someone is always able to pick up. If not Mom, then Dad. If not Dad, then Rachel. There is always somebody. I can’t help but get the feeling something is wrong. I pick up my pace towards the library hoping to get answers soon so I can get home.

Sarah waves at me, her nose not leaving the book she has stuck in front of her face. I wave back frantically walking towards the Atlas section. Most of the atlases the college has in their collection are local maps of Missouri - old explorer’s maps or whatever. But I eventually find an atlas that includes a map of Iowa, nestled between two other unrelated books. I quickly flip through the pages to find South Iowa. My eyes drift right to where Ashwood Hollow should be and… It’s blank. Just a field.

The entire world comes to a standstill. My breath catches in my throat as I see the year of the map in the far corner: ‘2021’. This isn’t an old map. I flip to another page to try to cross-reference it. Maybe it’s just a mess up. I follow the river that runs through town and… It’s not there. It’s not in any of the maps.

 I don’t even bother putting the Atlas back where it is supposed to go. I just put it down and rush back out towards my dorm. Sarah gives me a wave as I leave but I don’t pay her any mind. I quickly dial Mike’s number as I speed-walk towards my dorm.

“What’s up?” Mike says, occasional simulated gunshots from his game coming through

“Hey so I don’t know what’s going on but I’m freaking out here. I think something bad happened to my home and I know you said I said I’m from California but-“

“Hey man, can you slow down. I can’t keep up with all that yapping.” Mike interrupts.

I take a deep breath and ask him the simple question I called him for, “Can you come with me to Ashwood Hollow?”

“How far is it?” he asks.

“Five hours. I think. Hard to tell, GPS isn’t pulling it up.” There is a short pause as Mike contemplates, “I’ll get you lunch and dinner or whatever. I just can’t go alone.” I add.

“Fine. I’ll have my crap packed in a few.”

The drive is uneventful. We just follow the GPS leading to the closest location the GPS would pull up, an old camping ground. I used to go there as a kid for summer camp. Mike doses in and out of sleep, not being a good navigator. But I didn’t expect him to be of much help. I just needed somebody, anybody, to see Ashwood Hollow. I’m not crazy. It is real.

The GPS has me exit the highway and go onto a series of backroads that begin to look familiar. An old windmill off on the east side of the road that has been falling apart for years. An old billboard whose advertisement fell off during a tornado a few years back. I know I’m getting close to home.

But when I make the last turn that should have led me to Main Street, the road ends. It just… ends. No barricades, no signs, nothing but an empty field of grass and trees. My heart pounds in my chest, my anxiety rising by the second. This is wrong. This is all wrong. How can an entire town just vanish without a trace?!

I put my truck in park and sit dumbfounded. Mike perks his head up, barely waking up. He glances between me and the empty field ahead.

“Some place you got here,” He mutters.

“You aren’t helping!” I snap.

I cut the engine and get out of my truck, looking at what appears to be an endless field of grass. Maybe I just got the directions wrong. Maybe I just simply am wrong about where I thought I was. I’m so lost in my thoughts trying to prove myself right that I don’t even hear Mike get out of the truck.

He pats me on the shoulder and smiles at me, “Look man, if we are going to stop here may as well hike around.”

We walk around this field for what seems like hours. I know my home once stood here. I can trace the steps I used to take to school every day. I can even count my steps to where my family’s hotel should be. But… it’s not here. The only landmark of note is the river that ran through what used to be the center of town. Not even indents where the roads once were remain.

As the sun began to set, Mike and I started heading back to my truck, which still sits on the edge of the pavement. But as we do, Mike says he sees something. I follow him to a small grove of trees. And then my heart stops. Mike’s face pales as he reads the old, weathered sign: ‘Welcome to Ashwood Hollow’

Mike and I began back down the road towards our school. I take the same familiar roads I once took away from my home, not realizing it would be my last time. We pass by a few landmarks I remember. But when we pass by the billboard, half of an advertisement remains. We didn’t see it on the way in because it was facing away from us. But my stomach turns to ice when I read it.

‘Come visit the historic Hillwood Hollow Hotel! U-Turn at the next exit!'

The drive back to campus was done in nearly perfect silence. Neither of us knew what to say to one another. I wasn’t crazy. Ashwood Hollow is real. But it seems as if the world forgot about it. As if it was erased from this planet entirely other than two signs. I don’t know what happened to my family. I don’t know what happened to anyone from Ashwood Hollow. But as I sit in my dorm room, writing this all out, I know they are out there somewhere.

So I’m asking you all: Have you heard of Ashwood Hollow?
