To begin, this will be my last post on the matter of the Born tapes and all tapes that followed. I feel sick. My whole world changed in a matter of seconds when I encountered the Born Tapes and I’ve had to endure the reality of how I have changed from how it has progressed. I don’t recognise myself anymore. I can’t tell if I was ever me to begin with. I feel as if I’ve always been a tool for how my “dad” wanted me to be. Even these posts in some way or another could be all part of his plan. To spread the word of a new age. An age that he has constructed.

 

To those of you encountering this post for the first time, I will include the links to the previous updates below.

 

People around the office are beginning to call him the “Visitor”. Little is known about him, but we are almost certain that I was one of his victims. The theory is that he abducted me when I was a baby and fed me a lie that my mother died during childbirth and that we were on the road all the time for “work”. He never told me his real name since I only ever knew him as “dad”. “Work” was never a topic he went into detail about. We had no leads but those cameras which are now gone along with himself, as police and neighbours are yet to report seeing him after the night, he caught me watching one of his videos “House”.

 

The video started facing the back of a man dressed all in black. The man was on his knees in the middle of an aisle in between rows of wooden benches. He was in a church. The church was pitch black save for the man and the stone tiles around him as they remained illuminated by the moonlight coming in through the stained-glass windows on either side. The video lasted 20 minutes, 10 of which were the man knelt with his back to the camera. The man began to stand at this point struggling a little as he pushed himself up with his hands and began to turn slowly towards the camera. It was hard to make out his features due to the distance in which he stood from the camera. The man then spread out his arms with his palms facing upwards as he held them out at his sides lowered slightly, all whilst looking up. He remained like this for 2 minutes. He then lowered his hands and reached into his jacket pocket and took out a slice of bread. The man carefully ate the bread for 4 minutes.

 

Others and I have pointed out that it seems as if the man is crying whilst doing this. No sound is heard but his face starts to glisten in the moonlight which we assume to be from his tears being reflected. The man then eats the final piece of the bread with both hands but leaves his hands in front of his mouth for a few seconds. He looks at his hands in this position for 1 minute almost as if he’s analysing them. The man then reaches into his jacket pocket again and takes out a bottle of wine which sips. The man then places the bottle on the ground and walks along the wooden benches, his footsteps echoing throughout the church, and out of the frame of the camera. Footsteps can be heard getting louder and louder until the camera is picked up and the video ends.

 

This video hasn’t garnered much attention in comparison to the video “Romans”. The video is of police cars parked on a dirt road as police officers run back and forth to their cars and a field of wheat. This video only lasted 2 minutes but is arguably the most valuable in the entire investigation. This is because the number plate of one of the police cars is visible.

 

Tracking down the driver wasn’t that difficult. All police cars are owned by their associated department and all departments generally keep a record of who was in which car on which day at what time. The car in question however has only ever had 4 drivers. We contacted each one and asked them if they had ever been involved in an abduction case of a baby in the last few years. Only one responded.

 

“This is Detective Crawford, who am I speaking with.”

 

“Daniel Keller.”

 

“Hello Dan, may I call you Dan?”

 

“You can.”

 

“Okay, Dan. This conversation will be recorded so that we may use it as evidence in court. You are not a suspect Dan so don’t worry. Is this okay with you?”

 

“Yes, Yes, by all means”

 

“So Dan, can you tell me about your involvement in the baby abduction case a few years ago?”

 

*\*Silence\**

 

“Dan?”

 

“Sorry, sorry. Yes, I can.”

 

“Whenever you’re ready Dan.”

 

“It was a bad case from the start if you ask me.”

 

“A bad case?”                

“Yeah! You know? The cases that feel cursed or something. The ones where everyone knows it’s not going to end well.”

 

“Go on.”

 

“Well. It wasn’t the only abduction case you know. We had an ongoing one a few months before. Something about a lady’s baby and pram disappearing. She had looked away for only a second and boom! Gone. Almost as if they were never there…. W- We- We never found the baby….”

 

“It’s okay Dan. It's not your fault. Keep going if you can please.”

 

“We tried. We tried. We got countless calls from her. We lied. What the hell were we supposed to do? We kept telling her it would be soon. That she’d get her baby soon. It didn’t help when a second case was opened, and it took priority.”

 

“What was the second case?”

 

“Another baby abduction…. the lad didn’t even get to open his eyes…. he was taken from the hospital. The mother said the staff had laid him down next to her whilst she rested. She was going to stay the night, but…. Something came. The mother said she woke up to crying and… there was a person. They wore a gown…. their face…. it was completely white. She said its eyes were like black holes…. said she felt as if it was draining her energy away with just a look.”

 

*\*Silence\**

 

“Dan?”

 

“I saw it! In the woods…. It was in the woods. I couldn’t move… I couldn’t move. It was just as she said. It was looking at me. I couldn’t move. I can’t! I can’t! I have to go.”

 

“Dan wait! Where did you say these woods were?”

 

This is where the recording ends. Dan gave the location, but I can’t include it here. We can’t have people tampering with the area or getting themselves hurt.

It took a few hours for me and Detective Crawford to reach the woods Dan Keller mentioned, and with the sun beginning to set we set out on our two-man search party. Detective Crawford didn’t say much when we arrived. He just handed me a torch and began walking towards the treeline. He looked like an ant in comparison to the trees as he struggled to push past the overgrowth. Each step he took was shortly followed by an ensemble of muttered cursing and snapping twigs.

 

“Are you just going to stand there James?”

 

“Sorry”

 

I gripped the torch and flicked it on as I broke into a light jog after him. His struggle was hardly for show. Each step we took would have to be thoughtfully planned out by analysing which route was the clearest or cutting away the branches that had thorns with his pocketknife. Slowly but surely, we made it through. This portion of the woods was more open. There were fewer bushes, thinner tree trunks, and little to no litter on the floor compared to the overgrowth. It seemed like not many people ventured this far. The sun had completely set by this point. The woods were plunged into darkness, the crickets beginning to sing their lullaby and the owls interrogating us with their monotonous “Who”. The torches worked well enough.

 

“Couldn’t anyone else join us?”

 

“Geez, grow a pair, James! If you want to be a police officer, you have to be prepared to do police officer things. One of those things is walking around in the woods at night. It just comes with the job. You don’t get a choice.”

 

I rolled my eyes. For how much I idolised Detective Crawford in the beginning he was really starting to get under my skin. We continued wandering around aimlessly. From the look in his eyes, I could tell there was no way I could convince him to leave. He was going to find something tonight. He just had to. We walked for what seemed like ages. We walked until my feet felt like stumps. We walked until we had a reason to stop. Our reason came soon enough. It was a shed. The wood was rotted, moss grew down the panels and hung from the roof, and on the left, there was a field of wheat. This was it. This is where the “Born tapes were filmed”. My hands began to tremble, and my mouth felt dry, but I couldn’t look away. Inside I would find my answer. Inside I would find out who this mystery “dad” truly was. As soon as we saw the shed it was as if the entire forest had grown silent. There were no crickets, no owls, no nothing. Just us. Detective Crawford was the first to approach as he slammed his foot into the door and flashed his torch before him as it shot open. I raced up behind him and looked inside. This was it. The window from the “Prophecy” file, the table from the “Becoming a Man” file, and the arrangement of the room was a shot-for-shot replica of the “Warning” file. Detective Crawford advanced into the room.

“Police! Come out now!”

 

He stood there with his torch still raised waiting for a reply. None came. Not a single sound. He began to pace back and forth from the table to the window.

 

“You have until the count of three before I kick that bedroom door down!”

 

*\*Silence\**

 

“One! … Two! ….. Three!”

 

Running towards the door and slamming his foot into it just the same as when he arrived. The door fractured this time and split against the force sending a wave of dust scattering through the frame.

 

“Hands- “

 

He froze, his back facing me, and his torch still raised. He sounded as if he were gagging.

 

“Crawford- what is it? What do you see?

 

\*Silence\*

 

“God damn it Crawford don’t do this right now.”

 

My whole body began to shake, every thought flashing in my mind telling me to run.

 

“Crawford!”

 

“Wh- what the hell is this?”

 

I began to edge my way towards him. Taking a deep breath I darted my head around the corner and looked in. The smell hit me first as I desperately tried to pull my collar over my nose. Tears in my eyes I squinted to look. I had to see it. I had to… I can’t even begin to describe the scene before me. I can’t. I just can’t. I wasn’t the only one to be abducted. There was another, and they were in that room. Just as the Romans came for Jesus, they too came for this poor soul. Hung aloft like a symbol. They had been there a while. I immediately vomited at the sight. Heaving on my hands and knees the whole world beginning to spin beneath me.

 

“For the love of God close the door! Close the God damn door!”

 

“I- I- I- can’t. I can’t move”

 

Detective Crawford began to cry, a statue unable to avert his eyes. I blindly reached for the handle and slammed the door closed as he reached his arm out leaning against the door and continuing to sob. The fractured wood hid nothing in the room beyond.

 

“James”

 

It wasn’t Crawford. I might as well of been having a heart attack as my heartbeat pulsed in my own head. I slowly turned around towards the shed door. In the door frame, a figure stood. They had a long white gown far too big for them and their sleeves scraped along the floor as they walked towards me. Their face was covered in makeup, their face bright white, the eyeshadow as dark as the abyss, the pink circles on their cheeks leaving no notes of innocence anymore, their red lipstick shining in the torchlight, and the same golden blonde hair curled around their features. I was still on my knees. My mouth was agape and quivering, and my whole body was frozen. The figure still advanced with both arms ready to embrace me. I couldn’t do anything but close my eyes wishing the whole thing to go away.

 

“Please! Please! Please!

 

When I opened them again my peripherals were shrouded in hair as those eyes stared right through me, the figure's arms wrapped around my shoulders.

 

“Get the hell off of him!”

 

Suddenly the figure was hauled off of me and slammed into the wall.

 

“James go!”

 

I didn’t even hesitate. I shot up and ran like hell out of the door and into the woods as screams echoed behind me. I ran in circles around the trees stumbling over branches and roots, tears running down my face. I just kept running. I ran, and I ran, and I ran until I couldn’t run anymore. I just sat there on the ground defeated. My head in my arms and my heart in my mouth.

 

When the sun came up, I wandered around the woods more and eventually made it back to the road. When I made it back to the police department, I told them everything. We’ve had a search party since of everyone from our and the neighbouring department. No one managed to find the shed, or the figure, or Crawford. I don’t know what to do. I can’t look at those videos again. I wish I never did, to begin with. I should have never joined the police. I haven’t been able to sleep since. I still see them. That figure. I don’t know what’s real, but I see them everywhere. I hope you understand why I can’t continue to post about this anymore. I’ve given the cameras to the new guy to have a look at since officers have had to move on to more pressing matters. I’m sorry…. I’m sorry.
