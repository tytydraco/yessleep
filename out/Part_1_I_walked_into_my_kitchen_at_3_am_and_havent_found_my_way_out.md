This is going to sound *out* there, but I’m lost in a place that shouldn’t exist. I wish I was kidding. I woke up at 3 a.m., in that weird state where you’re tired but restless. I wandered into my kitchen… except it wasn’t my kitchen anymore.


The narrow little galley stretched on forever.


At first I thought it was a dream. I’ve had dreams like that before. But when I turned around, my living room was gone. In its place: a vast, empty room with no doors. That was new. 


So I stuck to the kitchen. Checked the cupboards, grabbed food and water. I’ve never done that in a dream before—I guess survival instincts kick in, even when you’re trying to convince yourself you’re fine.


Hours later, the kitchen ended. Every room since then has been empty. Endless hallways. Musty, well-trampled carpets even though there’s no one here.


I’m not kidding when I say it looks exactly like those Backrooms creepypastas we’ve all seen.


I’ve pinched myself—hard. I kicked a hole in the plaster of a wall and stubbed my toe on the foundation. This isn’t a fucking dream.


Thank *fuck* I carry my phone everywhere, even a sleep-induced walk to the fridge. 


It’s on 48% now, so I’m conserving battery. Problem is some of these corridors are pitch black. I’ve avoided most of them, but earlier the lights went out mid-way through a long hallway and I nearly shit myself. Phone’s flashlight was a godsend.


The room I’m in now gets reception, barely. If I hold my phone all the way up to the ceiling. The lights are on, and I pray writing this doesn’t jinx that. 


If I’m getting reception, then it can’t be the Backrooms, right? Who am I kidding? Trying to apply logic to a work of fiction. 


Is it fiction?


Oh god.


Where am I?


I’m not needed at work for the next few days. No one will notice I’m gone. This place is unnaturally quiet, too. I swear I can hear my heartbeat echo. 


I have 500ml of water, and a share bag of pretzels left. Maybe my survival instincts weren’t as good as I thought. It took me hours to get here and this place is a fucking maze. I should have stayed in my kitchen. Maybe I should go back? If the lights work, maybe the oven does? I could at least roast the chicken I bought before it goes bad.  


But the signal is here. 



It's 8pm now so I'll stay here for the night. Post this. See if I get any answers. 


Has anyone else experienced this? Am I losing my mind? This place feels too… *mundane* to be a hallucination.


Maybe its monoxide poisoning? I’m going to text a friend and ask them to check my apartment, they have a spare key.  If they tell me I’m not in there then... welp.


I don’t know how long the signal will last. If anyone sees this... please. Help. Somehow. Any advice, any previous experience. Anything. 


Something’s *lumbering* through the halls in the distance now. Or maybe it’s close. Hard to tell. The sounds bounce back and forth here.


What I’d give for silence again.


Please. Help.
