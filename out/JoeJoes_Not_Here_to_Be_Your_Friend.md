I need to be quick with this post.

Before JoeJoe finds out I'm gone.

The grownups don’t believe us.

Rachel did—it was like she knew him.

He showed up in the toy donation box at the orphanage I live at. He says he wants our love, where he comes from there is no such thing as love. Said he was visiting and the love that he experienced here was different than anything else in existence. He risked it all to be with us. Says he's not leaving until he gets every last drop. He says those that resist will end up in his tummy.

I found a letter. I'm not sure if it means anything. It was in Rachel's things. Looks like a kid’s writing.

To my Favorite toy JoeJoe  
JoeJoe, I never meant to hurt your feelings. I threw away the toys I got for my birthday—I'm sorry. I'm not trying to replace you. I never would. Just don't be mad anymore.  
I want things to be like they used to be. Me in my pajamas, you by my side, watching TV until way too late. Daddy would come in, tell us to go to bed already, and we'd laugh. I miss us laughing. Don’t you?  
I did what you told me. I drew the symbol under Daddy’s bed.  
I'll even stop asking where you got the blood.  
Now please, give my baby sister back.  
She never did anything to you. It's me you want. Just give her back.  
Please.

Peter says he saw the letter pinned to him when he came out of the donation box. Said it freaked Rachel out like she'd seen it before. I don’t think she packed it—JoeJoe must’ve brought it.

It started small, little movements in the dark. One kid would claim him as a sleeptime cuddle buddy and he would show up in another’s bunk by morning. We started getting glimpses of him walking in the middle of the night. He spoke to us eventually. Said he wanted to be our friends, said all he wanted was to love and be loved.

That wasn’t so bad. We didn’t know what he really wanted. Honestly, I’m unsure even now.

Peter can’t sleep anymore—he’s up all night crying. Says he misses Rachel. We all do.

Tasha loves JoeJoe. She is always the first to want him at bedtime and the first to cry when it was another’s turn. JoeJoe would point out her adoration and praise her for it. He said she was his favorite. That’s when he asked her to draw a symbol under Rachel’s bed.

He said it would make him stronger. He was only taking something humans couldn’t see and didn’t need. The symbols would force it out.

He cut Tasha’s finger with one of his teeth and she drew it in blood. One boy named Ethan didn’t like it—said he was going to tell Rachel about it and... Tasha told JoeJoe and Ethan ended up in the tummy. It reminded me of a crocodile eating a fish.

Before the sun rose, JoeJoe let him out. His mouth stretched, revealing layered teeth and tongues. One of them reached in and pulled Ethan out like a clogged drain.

Ethan doesn’t speak anymore. He just sits there looking like he’s seen too much. Poor guy.

It’s hard to sleep now—especially if JoeJoe is your cuddle buddy.

Rachel went to bed and while she was asleep, something crawled out of her mouth and JoeJoe ate it. It screamed as it went down. It sounded like Rachel.

Next day Rachel was different. Something in her eyes was absent. Her touch was cold. Her words were colder. She’s JoeJoe’s legs now. It’s more like she is the toy now.

We thought he wanted love—but this isn’t love.

This is something else.

Tasha is always around. She feels like the hangman looking for a problem. She gets mad at Peter when he cries too loud. We’re all scared to go to the tummy. Nobody wants to take a risk.

But JoeJoe asked Tasha to draw the symbol again—this time under the dean’s desk.

She hasn’t come out of her office since.

I have to get back. I’ll update when I can steal Rachel’s phone again.
