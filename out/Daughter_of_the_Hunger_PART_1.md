I woke up to the sound of Joshua crying again, like he does every morning by 6:00 a.m. That woman, Madeline—the one we're forced to call "Mother"—would stomp up the stairs like she does every single day for the past three years. This place feels like a living hell, with the same cycle repeating over and over again. But it won’t be like this for much longer. I finally have parents I can call Mom and Dad. I’m 15 now, but life wasn’t always this bad.

It started when I was about 3 years old, though I don’t remember much from that time—honestly, I barely remember anything at all. My first real memory is from when I was 4, maybe 5; it’s hard to tell nowadays. The years seem to blur together. I remember my grandfather holding me and telling me that my dad had passed away, that he was doing his duty for his country. Mom didn’t take it well at all. Let’s just say she spiraled out of control. She started using drugs and doing other things I’d rather not mention. I hated her for everything she did. If it weren’t for her, I might have had a normal life.

After that, everything went downhill. My grandparents died in a car crash about two years later when I was six. My mother joined them not long after—maybe six or eight months later. Time doesn’t feel real anymore; it just passes by.

As I lay there thinking, Madeline burst through the door in her long nightgown like always. I think Joshua wet the bed again. He backed up against the headboard, terrified of what she might do. I could hear his faint whimper as I hid under the blankets. I heard her scream, "Shut up! Shut up!" Then everything went quiet. I don’t remember what happened after that, but when I woke up, Joshua was on the floor playing with his toys. It was bright outside, the kind of brightness you get when there’s snow on the ground and the sun is shining. I knew it was around Christmas time, but I didn’t know how close it actually was—it was Christmas Eve.

Downstairs, I could hear the TV playing Christmas movies, and the smell of fresh cookies filled the air. They smelled so good, like they’d just come out of the oven. I knew we weren’t allowed to have any; those treats were reserved for Madeline’s real kids. She treated us like we were just a source of government money, and I guess that was okay. I never really understood what was good and bad back then—I was just happy to be alive. I wish I could say the same about my little brother, but I don’t even know where he is anymore. They separated us when we first entered the foster system. He must have been about a year old, and I would have been six or seven at the time.

Sorry if this is all a bit jumbled. It’s hard for me to remember everything clearly. I’ve been through so much in such a short time, and sometimes I can’t even remember how old I am. But I’m 15 now, if that helps.

I started to creep down the steps as the sound of Christmas music got louder and louder. I could see Madeline’s two boys sitting there, eating cookies and drinking milk. I’ve always hated them. They acted like they were better than me, like I was somehow inferior. But I used to beat them at every sport we played—at least until they started getting physical and hitting me. Madeline would just say, "That’s how boys play." I guess she was right, but I didn’t understand it. I never did.

As I reached the last step, it made a loud creak. That’s when Madeline looked up at me and said, "It’s time to pack your bags. You’ve got some worthless parents who want to pick you up today. You’re getting adopted."

My eyes went wide, and I couldn’t help but smile. I’ve been waiting for this day my entire life. After so long in the foster system, I was finally going to have parents—real parents—who actually loved me and wanted to take care of me. It felt like, for the first time, I mattered. Like someone actually wanted me.

The two boys glanced at me, frowning a little, as if they might actually miss me. But if they really cared, why would they hit me? Why would they treat me like I was nothing? Maybe they would just miss having someone to bully. Well, they’ll still have Joshua. I know I shouldn’t think that way, but Joshua has been different since the beginning—he’s always been a little slow. I love him, I really do, but the past three years have been tough. Can you imagine a 12-year-old having to take care of a kid like that? Not that it’s a bad thing, it’s just… hard.

But now, I could finally be a kid. I could finally have a good life. Or at least, that’s what I thought.

As I headed back upstairs, I noticed one of the steps was still broken. I remembered exactly how it got that way—I pushed one of Madeline’s boys down, and let’s just say he fell hard on his ass. Madeline was furious, but it was worth it. Sure, I might have ended up with a black eye after that, but I’d do it again in a heartbeat. I carefully skipped over the broken step and made my way to my room.

I gave Joshua a little hug and whispered that I’d miss him, that I’d try to visit someday. It was a bold lie, but he couldn’t tell the difference. I started packing my things—what little I had left, anyway. Madeline never liked the clothes I wore; she thought they were too revealing. But that’s just how I liked to dress. I loved bright colors because they made my long red hair stand out even more. Madeline was always jealous of it; she’d often suggest I cut it or dye it, but I never did.

I liked being me, not someone else. I refused to be forced into someone I wasn’t. Being true to myself was important, even if it meant defying Madeline every chance I got.

I started packing my clothes when a sudden feeling of dread washed over me. I could hear the loud roar of a truck outside—it sounded older than I was, and I’m not that old. I managed to pack maybe two or three outfits and one of the stuffed animals my grandfather gave me. I glanced down at Joshua playing with his toys and gave him a small kiss on the forehead, whispering, "Merry Christmas."

I headed to the bathroom, brushed my teeth, and did my hair. I wanted to look my best for my new parents. I was so scared of making a bad impression. What if they decided to leave me here? What if they didn’t want to take me home?

That’s all I wanted—a home. A place where I could feel safe. A place where I could have things that were truly mine. Isn’t that what everyone wants? Just a place to call home, to feel safe and loved. I never had that before, but now… now I will. God, it feels so good just to imagine it.

After I finished up in the bathroom—maybe ten minutes later—I heard voices chatting downstairs. It was an older man talking with Madeline. I figured this must be my new dad, so I made my way down the steps, eager to see him. He looked different from what I had imagined. He had a long gray beard and a shaved head. I noticed some tattoos on his arms, and he wasn’t wearing the nicest shirt—it looked like a band tee. I vaguely remembered one of the boys mentioning that band once.

He gave me a warm smile and said, “There’s my pretty girl.”

I smiled back, walking toward him with my hand outstretched for a handshake, but instead, he pulled me in for a hug. It was something I hadn’t felt in so long, something I almost couldn’t remember—a real hug, the kind that made me feel wanted. I hugged him back tightly as he asked, “Are you ready to go home?”

I nodded, looking up at him, then glanced over at Madeline. She shot me a look filled with pure hatred, but I didn’t care. I frowned a little but then turned to the boys. I gave them a small smile, and surprisingly, they smiled back, waving as I stepped out the door.

The moment I stepped outside, I had no idea that everything I thought was normal was about to change. There would be no more of the life I was used to. With this new family, nothing would be the same—and Papa was about to teach me the new rules.

As I made my way to the truck, I looked up at the man who would become my new dad and asked, “What’s your name?”

He chuckled and said, “Oh, you can just call me Papa. That’s what your older brother calls me, and that’s what Mama calls me too. And you, you’re our perfect little girl.”

I couldn’t help but smile as he called me perfect. No one had ever called me that before—it made me feel special, like I was finally cared for. When we reached the truck, he opened the door for me, and I smiled again. No one had ever been this nice to me. He took my bag and tossed it into the back a little roughly, but I figured that’s just how he was.

I climbed into the truck and looked around. It wasn’t the cleanest vehicle, but it wasn’t the worst I’d seen either. I noticed a pack of cigarettes and a couple of empty beer cans scattered on the floor. Papa got into the driver’s seat, giving me a warm smile.

“It’s going to be a bit of a ride, so make sure you’re all buckled in and ready,” he said.

I nodded, buckling my seatbelt, and settled in for the long journey ahead. For the first time in a long time, I felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, this was the beginning of something better.

He drove for what felt like four or five hours before he finally said, “We’re about halfway there.” I was shocked he had driven so far just to pick me up—it made me feel even more special. He glanced over at me and said, “Let’s stop and get some food.”

We pulled into a fast food restaurant, and he ordered me some chicken nuggets, fries, and a Hi-C. He got himself a burger, fries, and a Coke. We sat in the parking lot, eating our food. As I munched on my nuggets, he turned to me and asked, “Have you ever had venison before?”

I gave him a confused look. I had no idea what venison was, so I shook my head. “No, I’ve never had it before,” I admitted.

He seemed genuinely surprised. “You’ve *never* had venison?” he asked, almost in disbelief.

“No, sir—I mean, Papa,” I corrected myself quickly. For a second, his expression shifted, almost like he was upset, but then he brushed it off with a smile.

“Well, it’s really good,” he said. “I eat a lot of it. I’m actually a pretty good hunter. Maybe you can come with me sometime.”

My heart warmed at the thought. He wanted to include me in his activities. Usually, I had to beg or force my way into things like this. I nodded eagerly. “I’d love that, Papa.”

He dusted the salt from his long white beard, took a sip of his Coke, and then looked at me with a smile. “Let’s go, pretty girl,” he said.

I felt a surge of happiness, like maybe this was the start of something good—something I’d been waiting for my whole life.
