We moved in because there was nowhere else to go. The hostel was worse—mould-eaten walls, a kitchen flooded last spring, rats in the halls. This place? Not perfect. It smelled like damp and something I couldn’t quite name, but at least it didn’t reek of piss when I walked in. I called that a win. Angie called it a “shithole,” her eyes rolling back like she was about to laugh or cry depending on the mood. Still, we clinked cans of lager that first night and told the kids to “shut it” when they started whining about no Wi-Fi.

That was three weeks ago.

The smell of damp still lingers, but I’ve gotten used to it. Angie hasn’t. She’s sick of it. Sick of the peeling wallpaper, the way the sink keeps dripping no matter how much she twists the tap. She tells me this between drags of her cigarette, leaning against the kitchen windowsill, smoke curling up and out like it’s desperate to get away. My wife’s the kind of woman whose laugh could break glass when she means it, but it’s been a long while since anyone’s heard it. These days, it’s more of a low chuckle when she’s on her fifth can of lager, something bitter curled up at the edges.

Me? I’ve got this tightening in my chest, an ache somewhere beneath the bone, like something’s trying to crawl out (or maybe in). The temper comes easy now. One that embarrasses me in front of the kids, but I never let it go far enough to cause real damage. I keep telling myself that I’m a good dad, even when the mirror says otherwise—haunted eyes staring back, a reminder of too many sleepless nights spent listening to the dark breathe in this new home.

Tommy, my youngest, had a look on his face like he’d just eaten a bug the first night here. The boy doesn’t say much. Eleven years old but already too serious. He takes after me, and I don’t mean that as a compliment. Kids should be laughing, kicking a ball down the estate, but Tommy spends most of his time hunched over the floor scribbling on scraps of paper. I don’t like what he draws. I’ve caught glimpses. Long shadows. Stick figures with round heads and blacked-out eyes. Something’s been eating at the boy. I don’t know if it’s this place or if it started before we moved in. Before the crash. Before I fucked everything up.

When I asked him what he was drawing, he didn’t look up. “The Frightening,” he said.

“You mean something’s frightening you?” I corrected him, forcing a small laugh. “It’s frightening, not The Frightening.”

Tommy looked at me then, his face pale, eyes wide. “No, Dad. That’s its name.”

I shrugged it off, looked away, and said to myself it was nothing. But nothing doesn’t make the hairs on my neck stand up. Not like those drawings do.

Then there’s Casey, my daughter. Fifteen and angry as a cat in a cage with a look that cuts through anyone in the room. She’s got Angie’s fire, my scowl, and the trouble that comes with both. She’s been caught smoking in school and skipping class. I know it’s to get away—from here, from me, maybe Angie too. I want to be angry, but I remember what it was like at that age. I did worse. She’s got a mouth on her. I’ve heard her slamming doors and shouting on the phone to one of her mates, her voice echoing through the narrow hall only for Angie to yell back, “Shut the fuck up!”

There’s a hole in the wall from where Casey kicked it, right through the plaster. I still haven’t patched it up. What’s the point? Another hole will take its place soon enough—anger has a way of finding new places to leave a mark.

It was just meant to be a place. A council flat on a council estate. One of a hundred just like it. Nothing special, nothing worth looking at twice. But there’s something about this one. I felt it when I was sitting on the battered couch in the living room. Angie beside me, both of us half-drunk on cheap lager. The kids were asleep. I was staring into the blank TV screen and saw it. Just for a second. A flicker in the dark. Something behind me, a shape that moved just before I turned around. I didn’t tell Angie. She wouldn’t have believed me anyway. She was too busy complaining about our new neighbours, something about how Mrs Caldwell across the corridor had kept staring at her like she had a problem.

“Old cow’s probably deaf but she’s got eyes like a bloody hawk,” Angie had said while crushing a cigarette into the ashtray.

I laughed just to humour her and watched the reflection in the TV until I couldn’t see anything except my own face staring back.

Angie’s been on edge since the day we moved in. She says it’s the estate.

“It’s full of freaks and fuck-ups.”

She’s not wrong. I see them every time I step outside. The lads on the corner, hoods pulled up and passing spliffs back and forth, their eyes following me as I walk past. Mrs Caldwell’s curtains twitching when I open the front door. I’ve heard her muttering to herself about the ‘new lot’. Said it like she was expecting something. Like she knew.

“She’s fucking mad,” Angie said, stubbing out her cigarette and lighting another one, “If she keeps staring at me, I’m gonna give the bitch something to stare at.”

There was a bite to her voice, something sharp that I didn’t like. I told her to leave it, but she just looked at me. “You don’t get it, do you?” And I didn’t answer because she’s right. I don’t.

It’s not much better now. The flat still doesn’t feel like mine. The kitchen light’s decided to flicker every time I walk in, vibrating with a harsh buzzing that makes my teeth grind together. I told Tommy not to worry about it, “It’s just old wiring, son.” But the boy wouldn’t stop staring. I’ve tried changing the bulb, but it didn’t help. Now it’s just another thing I ignore along with the peeling wallpaper, the dripping tap, the hole in the plaster, and the cold draft that slips through every nook and cranny.

And then there’s the noises. I hear them at night when everyone else is asleep. Angie’s breathing heavy beside me, and I’m awake, listening. It’s coming from the walls—scratching. Soft and slow, like an animal trying to get in. Every time I get up and put an ear to a wall, it stops. I’m starting to think it’s only there because I’m listening. Fucking rats again; they’ve followed me here. But I never see them and tell myself it’s just old pipes, the wind, whatever makes old places like this groan and complain when the dark comes.

Tommy’s been sleeping in mine and Angie’s room for the past week. He said there was something wrong with his. Said he didn’t like it. I asked him why, and he just whispered with his eyes to the floor.

“The Frightening,” he said again, “It’s in my room.”

I tried to press him and tell him not to be daft, but Angie told me to leave it. “He’s a kid. Kids get scared of their own shadows.” So I did.

I took his mattress, dragged it to our room, and laid it on the floor beside our bed. He hasn’t said much since, but I see the way he looks at the door, like he’s waiting for something to come through it.

It was last night when it happened. Angie was asleep, Casey out, Tommy curled up on the floor beside me. I must’ve drifted off because the next thing I knew, I woke up to a loud knocking. Hard, deliberate, shaking the front door in its frame.

“Fucking hell,” I muttered, rubbing my face. “What now?”

I sat up, glancing at Tommy’s mattress. Empty. Typical.

“Tommy!” I shouted, dragging myself out of bed. “Where the hell are you?”

The knocking came again, louder this time. I stormed down the hallway, my bare feet cold against the floor. The hall felt longer than it should’ve, but I didn’t have time to think about that. The knocking kept going, relentless, like whoever was on the other side wasn’t planning to stop.

When I reached the door, I saw him. Tommy. Standing there, his little hands fumbling with the lock.

“Tommy, what the fuck are you doing?” I snapped, grabbing him by the shoulders. He didn’t even flinch. His eyes were wide, glassy, locked on the door.

“It’s here,” he whispered. “The Frightening wants to come in.”

“The what?” I barked, shaking him. “It’s the middle of the bloody night, mate. Get back to bed.”

The knocking stopped.

I sighed, running a hand over my face. “For fuck’s sake,” I muttered, unlocking the door. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”

I yanked the door open, ready to rip into whoever thought it was funny to wake me up.

But there was no one there. The corridor stretched out in front of me, empty except for the flickering overhead light casting sickly shadows along the walls. The air felt colder than it should’ve, biting against my skin like the open door had invited winter inside.

“Fucking hell,” I muttered under my breath, leaning out slightly to peer down the corridor. Nothing. Just the same grimy concrete and paint I’d seen a hundred times before. I shook my head, slamming the door shut hard enough to make the frame rattle. “Fucking kids,” I grumbled, locking the door again.

I turned back—and froze.

Tommy was still standing there, but my eyes were fixed on something behind Tommy, in the shadows that clung to the corners of the flat. My mouth went dry, and for a second, I couldn’t bring myself to speak.

It was there.

It was exactly like his drawings. Tall, impossibly tall, with limbs that stretched too far, bent in ways that didn’t make sense. Its face was blank, featureless, and yet I could feel it looking at me. A jagged grin split its featureless head, teeth blackened and broken, stretching far too wide.

One long, spindly hand rested on Tommy’s shoulder. The nails were sharp, curling like claws that could dig straight through him. Tommy didn’t flinch, didn’t pull away. He stood perfectly still, like he didn’t even notice it was there.

The thing tilted its head toward me, almost curious, and for the first time in my life, I felt truly frozen. My mind screamed at me to move, to grab Tommy and run, but my body wouldn’t listen. I just stood there, staring into that blank, grinning face.

And then it leaned down. Its head dipped lower, its mouth moving like it was whispering something into Tommy’s ear. I couldn’t hear it. I didn’t want to hear it.

Tommy blinked, slowly, and then turned to look at me. His expression hadn’t changed. Calm. Distant.

“He’s not going to leave, Dad,” he said softly, his voice steady in a way that turned my stomach. “He’s here now.”

The thing straightened, towering over both of us. Its grin widened, impossibly so, as if it was waiting. For what, I didn’t know. I didn’t want to know.

I finally managed to move, my hand snapping out to grab Tommy’s arm and yank him behind me. The thing didn’t stop me. It didn’t move at all. It just stood there, watching, the grin never faltering.

I slammed the bedroom door shut behind us, locking it with shaking hands. Angie stirred in the bed, mumbling something incoherent, but I didn’t answer. My back pressed against the door as I slid to the floor, holding Tommy close as he stared up at me, calm as ever.

“What the fuck was that?” I whispered, more to myself than anyone else.

Tommy didn’t answer. He just rested his head against my chest, his small hand gripping my shirt.

“He’s not leaving,” he repeated quietly. “Not ever.”

I don’t know what the fuck to do. I can’t leave this room with that thing out there, but I can’t sit here either. Casey’s still outside, and if something happens to her... Jesus. Angie won’t believe me. Even if she did, what could we do? It’s here. It’s already in.

I’m not the kind of bloke to ask for help. Never have been. But I don’t think I’ve got a choice anymore. I need someone who knows what this is, what the fuck it wants, and how to get rid of it.

If you’ve seen anything like this—if you’ve heard of something called The Frightening—you’d better tell me. I don’t care how mad it sounds, I don’t care if you think I’m off my nut. Just tell me what the fuck to do before this thing kills us all.
