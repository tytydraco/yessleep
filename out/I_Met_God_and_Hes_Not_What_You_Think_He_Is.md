
I used to work nights at a bar in Fayetteville, North Carolina. It wasn’t the best gig—not with all the young soldiers mistaking friendliness for an invitation. You could always tell them apart by their variations of the high-and-tight haircut. Most thought a big enough tip would earn them a night in my bed. It didn’t, but the money paid my rent, so I endured the nightly routine of drinks, cheap pickup lines, and half-hearted apologies.

That night started like any other. The music blared, the air thick with cigarette smoke and the scent of spilled liquor. But then *he* walked in.

An older man, silver streaking his unkempt beard, shoulders weighed down by an invisible burden. He had the look of someone who had seen more than his fair share of heartbreak. Unlike the usual crowd, he wasn’t there to party or pick someone up. He just wanted a drink.

*"What’ll it be?"* I had to lean in, my voice barely cutting through the noise.

*"Whiskey… make it a double."* His voice was deep, tired. He wasn’t just drinking—he was trying to forget.

Hours passed, and the crowd thinned. The jukebox played softer now, just background noise to the occasional bursts of drunken laughter. I stole glances at him. Glass after glass, he kept going, eyes glossy, jaw set tight. 

When he wiped at his eyes, I knew. He was here to drown something deeper than just a bad day.

*"What’s eating away at you, friend?"* The words left my mouth before I had time to second-guess them.

He looked up, almost surprised someone had noticed. *"You’re the first to ask that since I got here."* He swirled the last bit of whiskey in his glass. *"What made you ask?"*

Something about him reminded me of my father—the kind of man who swallowed his grief in silence. I shrugged. *"You just look like you’ve got something heavy on your chest. If you want to talk, I’ll listen. If not, that’s fine too."*

He hesitated, then exhaled, long and slow. *"I’m a father,"* he said. *"To many children. More than I could ever count. I tried my best with them, but they resented me. When things went wrong, they blamed me. When things went right, they never thought to thank me. Eventually, I gave up trying."*

I frowned, thinking about my own dad—how I had blamed him for everything, never considering the weight he carried. *"Kids can be ungrateful. Doesn’t mean they don’t love you."*

His lips trembled. He turned his face away, like he didn’t want me to see him break. *"There was one son I hurt more than any other."* His voice cracked, barely above a whisper. *"He loved me unconditionally, and I let him suffer. I justified it in my mind, told myself it was for the greater good. But I never forgave myself."*

A chill crawled up my spine. *"What… what happened to him?"*

His fingers gripped the glass, knuckles white. *"He was beaten. Mocked. Betrayed. Nailed to a cross. He begged me to save him. He died thinking I had forsaken him."*

The words sucked the air from my lungs. I swallowed hard. He was drunk. He *had* to be.

*"I’m not drunk, and I’m not crazy."* He looked straight at me, and for a moment, I swore he saw every sin I had ever committed. *"I don’t expect you to believe me. Not yet."*

I forced out a laugh, but it felt hollow. *"Alright, if you’re him, why are you in a bar in Fayetteville, North Carolina? Shouldn’t you be off doing, I don’t know, divine stuff?"*

He smirked. *"Because I’m expecting company."* 

The door swung open.

The man who entered was... breathtaking. Perfect, in an eerie, unnatural way. Dark hair, sharp suit, and eyes that held the weight of every wicked thought ever conceived.

*"Dad. I wasn’t expecting to see you here tonight."*

The room fell silent. The remaining patrons—mostly off-duty soldiers—stiffened, as if they sensed something was wrong but couldn’t quite place it.

The old man didn’t blink. *"I know you weren’t. That’s why I’m here. You’ve been spreading like a disease, and I won’t stand by any longer."*

The man in black chuckled, shaking his head. *"You think you can ground me like you used to? Face it, old man. I own this world. Have you *seen* the news? They don’t fear you anymore. Half of them don’t even believe in you. But me? Even the most ignorant among them knows my name."*

A shadow passed over the old man’s face. *"They are not yours to break."*

*"And what will you do about it?"*

Silence.

Then the old man moved.

One second, he was standing by the bar. The next, he had the man in black by the throat, slamming him into a table so hard the wood cracked.

*"Stay down,"* he warned.

The man in black laughed—a guttural, inhuman sound. He rose, brushing off the splinters. A soldier, emboldened by too much beer and too little sense, grabbed his shoulder. *"Hey, asshole, take it outside—"*

Before he could finish, the man in black spun and *ripped his throat out*.

The soldier staggered back, blood bubbling from his lips. Then he collapsed. Dead before he hit the floor.

Chaos erupted.

The other soldiers lunged. It was over in seconds.

Limbs torn. Heads snapped. Blood everywhere.

I ducked behind the bar, heart hammering. Then, just as suddenly as it began, the silence returned.

When I peeked over the counter, only the old man remained. The bodies, the blood, the man in black—*all gone*.

My hands shook as I reached for the shotgun beneath the bar. I leveled it at him, but my voice betrayed me. *"W-where… what…?"*

*"They’re fine,"* he said simply. *"Back in their barracks, sleeping off what will no doubt be a killer hangover before PT."*

I stared, my mind refusing to process. He reached into his pocket, pulled out a hundred-dollar bill, and placed it on the counter.

*"For the drink."*

Then he turned and walked out as if nothing had happened.

I don’t work at that bar anymore. 

I don’t drink anymore either.

And I sure as hell don’t go to church.

Because I met God once.
