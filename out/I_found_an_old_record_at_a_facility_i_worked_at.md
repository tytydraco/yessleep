Good day to everyone here, call me joseph, i'll be telling you about something that unsettled me, something that rattled me down to my bones, something that i think everyone should know about.  


Let's talk about me first, i'm an average or well not quite an average dude 21y with a loving boyfriend 22y, we're both living happy and fulfilling lives, he stays at home and does the housework while i go to my.. work, it's honestly spicier than your average work, hell, i bet even spicier than being a soldier but whatever.   


It was a sunny yet chilly day, i woke up and found him next to me, the love of my life, i don't remember how i got him but i'm happy i did, i got up from bed, took a shower, got dressed and headed out for work.   


You see, my work isn't like your work or anyone else's work, no, it's different. I work as an engineering manager in a facility where entities, anomalies and basically monsters are captured and kept secure, i make sure the engineers do their jobs, fix the test bots and basically do engineer related stuff.   


Today, in my office, i found something, it was a weird USB stick, curious, i booted up my computer and plugged the USB stick in, it was downloading something, a video file. Nice, probably a movie someone before me forgot here, i could watch it in my break time.   


I worked hard that day looking forward to that movie, i kept thinking about what it could be, everytime the radio announced people to be on break, i hoped it would be us, the engineers, but it wasn't, until it did..

"Engineering unit, breaktime, 1:30 PM until 2:15 PM." 

The radio came to life and announced our breaktime, i squealed like a child getting their first candy bar and quickly headed for my bag to take out my food my dear made for me and put it on the desk, then i headed to the coffee machine to make myself a cup of cappuccino and headed back to my office, i sat down, took a sip of my drink and laid it down on the table so i can look for the file and i found it!   
I opened it, mug in hand and started watching.

Hello, sam here. I'm the writer for the P.P.E, you guys probably know me as the writer of the P.P.E. Anyways, straight to the point, i have some good and bad news, which i never thought i'd say, but now i must.   
Let's get to the good news first, so the maxed foxes have been **exterminated**. They are no more, we've been sending teams upon teams to raid their bases and neutralize every single one of them, even if one is out there, they won't be for long.   


Onto..the bad news, to be honest, these are much more than the good news.. Eh, doesn't matter. Right, so let's start off with the fact that many of our commanders, one parent and almost all of the people responsible for guiding soldiers in raids, expeditions and captures have been killed. We can't find anyone and most of our commanders are demoralized, they don't really want to go out there, find an entity only to have no one radio them, tell them when to come back or when to deploy and what to do, add onto that the fact that one parent died and they're one of the few commanders left and you get to understand their demoralization.   


Next..we have uh, the fact that we've been experiencing rapid entity breaches and experienced lots of M.F raids, basically this has weakened us and decreased a lot of our personnel and has even "deleted" some sites from existence or rendered them useless, such as site-7, which was rapidly raided by the M.Fs and then had E-253 breach, a wendigo and bird hybrid type of thing which is pretty fuckin' hard to deal with since it's a wendigo and it flies, i don't remember how we got it here in the first place but uh i'll guess lots of deaths were involved.  


Right, last stuff. We're disbanding, yes, the P.P.E is disbanding, we're going to be no more, why? Well, rapid entity breaches, raids which weakened us and a rapid decrease in site personnel and also lack of funding due to the world governments being in a tough spot right now and our main source of income being the united states. I don't really quite know what happened to us, we were majestic, strong and pretty big at the start but now we're weak and almost devoid of life. We can't really revive this, we used all of our chances.  


So, how will we all disband? Simple.   


Nuke all the sites, entities inside. Personnel will be evacuated and a team of every site's best fighters will be outside waiting for any entities to emerge to make sure everything is terminated.   
We'd ship our entities to someone else but uh..the SCP foundation isn't going to accept anything and our entities are too dangerous to be transported, it wouldn't be fun to deal with something that moves faster than light and more erratically than a kid on sugar rush let alone put it in a truck or ship.   


It was nice being with all of you, i am sam, the official writer and typist for the P.P.E.  
Farewell, all of you, i'll see you..well, never, i love you all, boys and girls.  
You were like my grandchildren, but oh how times change.

I sat there in silence, not knowing how to react, i was confused, scared, angry and sad, i was angry at our managers for not telling us anything about us almost disbanding, i was sad for this guy and what he went through, i was scared for some reason and i was confused for good reason.  


I was in an emotional wreck, i finished my food in silence and completed my shift, i'd then head to my boss and ask him about the USB.  


I entered his office and there he was, sitting in his chair, reading a book, i couldn't see what he was reading, but i didn't care at the time.

"Boss, there's something i need to talk to you about." I asked him nervously, fearing his anger.  


"What do you want?" He grumbled, as if i were ruining his day and making him more annoyed than he already is.  


"D-Do you know anything about this USB?" I stuttered while asking him that, sweating and with my shaking hand, handed it over to him.

&#x200B;

"Huh..weird, where'd you find it?" He asked, just as confused as i was and began examining it.  


"My office." I answered truthfully, not wanting to waste time.  


He looked me dead in the eye, sweat trickling down his cheeks, then down his shirt, he looked nervous and scared, i had never seen him like this.   


"A-Are you sure..?" He asked nervously, he was the nervous one this time.  


"Yes, i'm sure, i found it when i was working and thought it was a movie but it turned out to be something else." I told him the truth, then i snapped.  
"Why didn't you tell me anything about this?! We had a writer and he's probably dead now? We were going to be disbanded? A parent even died and what happened to the nukes!? What hap-" I was about to finish my rant when he cut me off.  


"Shut up, shut up! You talk too much!" He hissed at me like a snake, i was going to respond when he beat me to it.   
"I haven't told you because i didn't think it was important, didn't want to, didn't need to!" He snapped back at me, making me feel like i was stupid for accusing him of this "crime".  


"I'm sorry, boss, i'm going to go now." I apologized and exited the room, ashamed of what i had done, i didn't want any more answers from him, so i had to start looking, first things first were my office and sure enough, i found a secret drawer in the wall after some looking, i opened it up and found just one paper. It was old and it was wrapped in some dry cloth, i removed it and found what seemed to be gold ink or something, the author's intro and outro were written in gold, while the rest in silver ink or what seemed to be it.

Good day to you my grandchildren, i'm back with some great news. You see, we didn't nuke the site, we almost did, but the parents called that plan a failure and how it wouldn't fix anything, so we ditched it. We decided to start offering bodyguards for famous people, mercenaries in certain wars and started aiding the police in raiding houses and got rid of some of the ISIS members.  


Doing that made us recruit more people and also get more funding, which really helped us revive ourselves again and finally come back, we're now much better than the past few months and with the masked foxes defeated, i think we'll be much better than ever!  


I wish i could tell you that one parent came back, but they didn't. We're still grieving and mourning their loss and the multiple commanders that died trying to help.   
I'll be writing more for you, i'll see you next time.  
*-Sam*

And that was it..that was honestly the end of it. I left it at that and headed back home, i went to sleep early since i was pretty exhausted today.   


The next day, i went to work. I felt something was off, the air was heavy and hot, it was a bit harder to breathe and my reflexes were slower, i headed to the morgue room, where no one went to except the ones dealing with the corpses. I was looking for the commanders that died, i needed to know more, i just needed to find commanders that died from september to december, but i couldn't find anything, there was too much.  


Then, i realized how silly this was, i came back  to my senses, i knew i shouldn't be here, so i went to the door but a gust of wind slammed it shut. I was terrified now, i went for my radio but i couldn't do anything with it, the lights went out. I curled into a ball and shut my eyes tightly, i was terrified, horrified, i was scared of what might hurt me, then i  heard it, faint voices.  
*"Riteet.."*  
*"Muv it.."*  
They sounded like nonsense.   
I felt cold hands on me, i was then yanked and dragged for god knows how long, my chins burnt and were red, then, the dragging stopped.   
I kept my eyes shut and eventually went to sleep when someone found me. I awoke and i was on the ground, in front of the morgue's door, i was taken to the medical department where my chin was treated, then i was asked what happened , i told them everything and was scolded for going in there, but they sent a team to investigate, no one found anything.  


I took the day off, but when i was at home, i received a message from my boss.  
"Hey, there's some news. They found this footage in the morgue, take a look." My boss sent me a message and a video, the thumbnail was the morgue.  


I pressed the video and watched, it was silence at first, then the door opened and i came in. I saw something move, but didn't see what it was, it was too fast, i replayed but still couldn't make out what it was so i just continued, the door slammed shut as expected and then the voices began, but they were clearer this time.   
"Retreat.."  
"Move it.."   
They were telling me to move it, to retreat, to get out and get up, but i didn't, i stayed there. Then, something on all fours emerged from the shadows, i couldn't make out the shape but i bet my fucking soul it wasn't human or animal, i was yanked by an invisible force and the creature kept trying to get me but the force kept dragging me more until i was outside, then the creature gave up and disappeared into the shadows.  


I was shaking by then, i closed the video and clicked away, my boyfriend asked if anything was wrong and i just shook my head, he seemed concerned and i couldn't blame the guy. I'd then go to sleep a while later.  


That's my story, it's not as spicy or scary as the others, but it's true and it matters to me, not everyone works in a facility that contains demons for a living, not everyone gets to have such a lovely partner and not everyone has such a good life, i do and i have all of it.  


Though, there's something that bothers me to this day, i still don't know how the parent died, now that i think about it, i'm actually concerned, what killed them? They have inhuman guards, ones so strong they'd fist fight god and win.  


I shouldn't think about it, why should i? I shouldn't, farewell everyone and have a good day.
