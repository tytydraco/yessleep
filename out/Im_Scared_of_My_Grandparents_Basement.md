I had always been scared of the basement in my grandparent’s house. In their kitchen behind the round table was a plain white door, beyond it were the basement stairs. Old, made of wood, and uncarpeted they would creak with every step. The creaking would echo out into the darkness and reverb back. These were the kind of stairs that had no vertical planks under the front of each step, so I was always afraid my foot would get caught in between the steps and trip me. This was a common occurrence among my cousins who were less careful than I was. On top of that, there was no railing along the side so if you did fall there was nothing to grab onto to catch yourself. With this basement that strange feeling you get when going up the stairs happened every single time; that adrenaline spike and sinking feeling in your gut, as if you have to outrun something that wasn’t there before. I would fly up the stairs, worried every time that my foot would get caught or that one of the steps would snap under the pressure.

There were hardly any lights in the basement, just two dangling bulbs that only had pull chains to turn them on, no switch. When first heading down the only light to see would be what came spilling down from the kitchen at the top of the stairs or from the small amount of sunlight the tiny basement windows would allow through. The room itself wasn’t so bad when it was fully lit, but at night, in the pitch dark, trying to find a lightbulb string was terrifying. In the shadow, I would constantly mistake subtle inconspicuous noises for something trying to sneak up on me. The creak of the floor above me was a kidnapper coming down the stairs; the flame in the furnace igniting was the breath of a creature in the darkness.

The entire basement was unfinished, it was only a cement hole in the ground. From the stairs, there was a short bit of room where the laundry machines sat and large steel pipes stretched up from the ground. The sump pump hole was also on this side of the room, now and then it would churn up some water and leave a slimy residue on the floor nearby, when it did this the place would smell horrendous for hours. Straight ahead of the stairs was a spare fridge that stored extra drinks, this fridge was the main reason people other than my grandparents came down here. It was guaranteed at least once during a family event that one of the kids would be sent downstairs to grab sodas or beers for the adults. To the right of the stairs was the big storage space, a forty-foot expanse that felt much longer to a child trying to turn on the second light in the darkness. There were no walls for things to hide behind, but the objects in the space created plenty of other hiding spots I convinced myself were in use. Boxes lining the perimeter of the space that were tall enough to crouch behind. Stacks of bins full of holiday decorations lined up parallel to each other along the wall creating a false wall that I couldn’t see behind. A spare wardrobe on the far side of the room that only hid whatever was behind the door. A rack of extra home supplies behind the stairs that created a blind spot directly behind the descender. In my young mind, I knew there was nothing else in the basement, but what if this time there was? I always had to double-check check there was no one in the basement, every crevice would be scoured before I could relax and play.

When I would come down I would reach for the first light at the bottom of the stairs. I couldn’t see much against the surrounding wall of black but the small pool of light was enough to locate the bins and wardrobe. My eyes would lock onto those hiding spots in the basement, I couldn’t look away or else something could ambush me. I would maneuver around in the darkness looking for the next light string. Until that light was on there could be no comfort. I would go to check the hiding spots as quietly as I could to try and trick whoever was there into thinking I wasn’t looking. I would get that same tension as going up the stairs in the dark, like being on a roller coaster just before the big drop. Nothing, there was never anything, but I couldn’t shake that feeling. There was always the paranoia of somebody watching me even when the basement had been checked and there were other people around.

I was forced down into that basement too many times. My grandmother had five sons, leading to almost twenty grandchildren. So during family events, we would be sent down into the basement to play and really get us out of the way. It became routine even when there weren’t so many people there, the kids go in the basement as a rule. I would visit with just my parents and be sent to the basement… alone in the dark.

The visit I remember more than any other started as normal as any other would. My parents and I pulled into my grandparent’s driveway and approached the front door. It was always unlocked so we just let ourselves in. My grandparents were excited to see us and we went through the whole surface-level catching up that older people did with kids. Then without much of a conversation, I was ushered to that flimsy, white basement door.

I stood at the top of the stairs and the door closed behind me. My heart beat faster as I stared down into the suffocating darkness below. I waited, straining to see beyond the black, waiting for my eyes to adjust. The familiar putridness that came from the sump pump greeted me the longer I stood there. With a deep breath, I began my descent, each step carefully placed to avoid the creaks of the old wood boards. A faint sliver of light snuck through the gap under the door above, but it only managed to cast a thin line across the slanted ceiling, choked out by the darkness.

I reached the cold concrete floor, I swung my arm around, grasping for the light cord above. I hit the cord, too hard, the small metal bead at the end struck the lightbulb with a sharp *ting* and got tangled. My pulse quickened. I jumped as high as I could, fingers desperately searching for the cord. My fingertips brushed the bulb, but the string was just out of reach. I jumped again and again, each one draining me more than the last. Just as my legs began to tire, the string slipped between my fingers and I pulled. The light turned on as suddenly as the string snapped in my hand. I placed the broken string on the second step, a reminder for later.

I could hear the gentle whirring of the washing machine to my left. It was comforting to know that one of my grandparents had been down here recently, nothing had happened to them. The basement was colder than usual, the chill cut through me like I was drowned in ice water. The hairs on the back of my neck shot up. I wrapped my arms around me and tried to move on. I squinted into the void, almost positive I could see shadowy figures darting around looking for places to hide. My eyes were drawn to the barely visible outline of the wardrobe, I could feel its presence taunting me from over there. I started off to find the second light string in the darkness. Stepping out of the illumination, I slipped a bit on something slick. The sump pump must have overflowed pretty badly this time, finding the slime beyond the stairs was unusual. My right sock was wet from the puddle now.

*Skshhhh*. Something shifted behind the stack of bins, a sound that sliced through the quiet like a knife. I was distracted by my slip and hadn’t seen if there was any movement ahead. My heart thudded so hard against my chest that I could feel it in my skull. I froze every nerve in my body on high alert. What could that have been? The possibilities flooded my mind, every one terrifying. A murderer, a zombie, a group of rats, a sinkhole opening up, or maybe a ghost. Panic gripped me, my body flooded with adrenaline. After some time, the silence settled back in, and I couldn’t hear my heartbeat anymore. The thought of heading back to the stairs came to me, but I knew I would be just as uncomfortable there if this light wasn’t turned on. I tried unsuccessfully to trick myself into believing it was nothing, maybe my foot had scraped weirdly against the floor.

I found the other light cord doing my best not to make another sound, save for the smacking of my wet sock against the concrete, all the while my eyes never left the far corner where the wardrobe stood. Now I had to check, I veered to the right to approach the bins. My heart pounded louder as I inched closer, my body tense. I crouched slightly, preparing the peer around the stack of bins. My hand trembled as I placed it on the outer bin, steadying myself from a bout of shaky legs. I stood there for an eternity trying to summon the courage to move. I glanced to my right to look under the stairs, where I could see straight through to the other wall. The wooden cover for the sump hole was displaced, usually, my grandparents put it back in place shortly after.

Finally, I took a deep breath and jumped into the narrow passage between cluttered stacks. Nothing. I almost relaxed, and then something caught my eye. The last stack of plastic bins in the row was out of place as if something had pushed them aside.

*No, no, no…* My mind repeated in a frenzied chant. I was spiraling, trapped between the urge to flee and the fear of the unknown. The rational part of me argued that nothing could be down here, they would have had to pass my grandparents upstairs. But reason was drowned out by the terror in me. I remembered that the front door was always unlocked… anyone could come inside if they weren’t paying attention to the door. Suddenly, the washing machine started banging violently, a sudden burst of noise that made me jump and let out a yelp. The uproar was so intense, it blotted out everything else, leaving me in a state of temporary deafness.

I forced myself to walk along the row of bins, my hand trailing along the plastic, the feeling grounding me. The further along I went down the synthetic hallway, the stronger the putrid sump smell became. I pushed the bins back into place softly, trying to restore some semblance of order. It was then I noticed the brightly colored golf shirts, still on their hangars, soaking wet and scattered on the floor outside the wardrobe. My thoughts stopped, and I stared at the shirts, the silence in the basement now throbbing with unspoken words. The wardrobe seemed to hum with anticipation, whispering to me, beckoning me to open it.

In a final burst of defiance, I flung the doors wide open, bracing myself for the unspeakable horror within. The acrid odor slapped me across the face burning the inside of my nostrils. There, waiting for me, was a massive, pulsating slimeball glistening in the dim light. I tried to scream, but it was already upon me. The form had oozed quickly from the wardrobe like a living shadow, silencing me with a suffocating grip that smothered my face, trapping the scream in my throat.

I can’t fully describe the sensation, it was as if the thing was probing me, a cold, alien presence pressing down as it enveloped my body in its oily sludge. I thrashed wildly, my arms and legs flailing, but I was a fly in a paper trap. My limbs were caught in its gelatinous mass, each movement only dragging me deeper. It was so cold, the chill was bone-deep as the warmth was sucked away from my body. I felt like I was in a block of ice, so cold that it began burning my skin. My lungs protested, I wasn’t prepared to hold my breath so I exhausted my small supply quickly.

*You’ll do*… echoed a voice inside my head, a thought that wasn’t my own. Just as darkness edged in at the corners of my vision, a crushing pressure bore down on my chest, forcing my mouth open in a desperate gasp for air. But it wasn’t air that filled my lungs. The viscous substance of the creature poured in, choking and invasive, forcing its way down my throat. My hands were pinned, the creature’s cold mass was too large to fit inside me but invaded my very being. The last of my air escaped in a silent scream and I slipped into oblivion.
