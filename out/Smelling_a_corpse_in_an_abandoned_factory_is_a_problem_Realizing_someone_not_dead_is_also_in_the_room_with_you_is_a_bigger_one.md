I have always loved urban exploring, even if it’s not the safest of hobbies. Certainly had my fair share of encounters with police, feral dogs, and squatters. But being calm and having a quick wit has kept me out of trouble. But sometimes trouble has a way of finding you regardless. 

The worst experience I’ve had was when I brought a friend to show him a massive, disheveled and derelict candle factory. I had been visiting it for two years up to that point. Pilfered it of unused candle jars and old wax that still had a crafted aroma. Found bobbles from the sixties and other neat things. I was always awed to see the overgrown kudzu blot out the huge windows and bay doors around the property. It crawled up the huge smoke stack heavily as well.

 I was wrapping up our tour as we headed out into one of the larger spaces of the factory, a storage floor I think it was. As I shimmied through a slightly open bay door I got a punch of straight death and rot to my nose. Something was dead as shit in here. I could tell that it wasn’t small either. Could’ve been a dog, I don’t know. I couldn’t see the source. It actually smelled like it was wafting up from underneath the water damaged and decaying floorboards. I knew this place had a sub basement area.

 As my friend and I are slowly making our way to the exit he gets the fear of god in his voice and says “We need to leave.” It all got really fucked really quick when I look up at a plexiglass panel covering a bulletin board in front of us. What I saw is still burned into the back of my eyeballs. The natural light from the windows behind us showed silhouettes very clearly on the reflection of the plexi panel. There should have been two reflections. Myself and my friend, but there was a third a short ways behind us. Just fuckin staring at us. 

I whip around but I don’t see anyone. I don’t dwell on it for a second, there’s a good many things in this warehouse section of the factory they could’ve ducked behind. I watched our back as we got the fuck out of dodge. We got back to the car and we were pretty quiet most of the way home. After a bit we began to talk about it, we had our theories but no real catharsis. That event fucked with me for a couple months after. So against my better judgement I went back there. 

This time I brought two friends with me. We threw glow sticks down every rotted hole in the floor so we knew all our potential exits and proceeded into the sub basement. It was pretty eerie down there. Mind you, the sub basement had a dirt floor. What we found was more than I really anticipated. When we reached the part of the basement underneath where I remembered the smell of death had been strongest, I found my source. 

We looked at what appeared to be a dug up and empty shallow grave, roughly 6ft long and 3ft wide. It wasn’t a feral dog nest, I’ve seen plenty of those. The worst part is there were grooves of four along the sides. As if it had been dug by hand. What a shit place to be put to rest. Guess that was all the closure I was gonna get. 

I personally think a murder victim got dumped there, being that this abandoned property sits in a rough part of town. Maybe whoever I saw that day was the perpetrator, and maybe they were checking on the scene. I think when they saw us they got spooked and moved the body afterwards. I don’t know, and I never will. Probably better that way. I can’t bring myself to go there at night anymore, and I never go by myself or without my pistol. Adventure is out there, but you may not always like what you find. Always try to be safety minded, and always be aware of your surroundings.
