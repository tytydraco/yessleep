This incident is about 15 years old. When I was still a young man of 25 years old. My family(Dad,Mom,my two sisters and one brother) became very poor after my grandfather's death, all things started getting downhill.All the animals at the farmhouse we owned at that time died just a day after his death. And the responsibility to take care of grandmother and us fell upon my dad who was had just gotten married at that time. He had to left his job in a city and come to us in a small village with no scope of work and earning. I am the eldest son due to which I also had to take care of the family. I grew up in poverty going to a government school with teachers who didn't knew how to teach yet I studied hard and was in top three toppersof every class. Soon it was time for me to go to college and I wanted to pursue a career in Commerce and accounts but my Dad forced me to take science and I ended up failing that year. I finished my graduation in arts. But my Dad left his job at the most crucial time of my life and the responsibility of my sister's marriages fell upon my head. I arranged the dowry, I paid lakhs for their weddings and for their colleges. All the money I was earning went to my family. Once on a such regular when I came to city I started looking for an apartment which I could share with a roommate as the prices of individual apartments were very high. I still remember the day from which some weird incidents started happening with me daily at 2:12 am. I finally was able to find an apartment with a surprisingly cheap price. I wass provided a room where I slept on couch as I didn't had money for a bed . So, on the first day I was sleeping there, I remember sleeping at 9Pm that night. I woke up at exactly 2:12 am at night I was not able to move my body and even moving fingers seemed a daunting task I was feeling a lot of pressure on my chest like someone was sitting on my chest. Now looking back I wonder why I never actually thought it could be a ghost maybe I was not aware of the incidents that happened at the apartment way before. So, I just layed like that for quite a while and it got normal after about half an hour and I fell asleep. Next day, when I woke up I thought I was just a nightmare as I had been in a lot of stress. So it just brushed it off. But next day it happened again, and the started happening every day, I was getting moddy and tense. So, I started enquiring about that room and was told about the landlord's sister who had became mad in that apartment and died. But my foolish brain still wasn't able to think of an exorcist Or priest. I spent about an year there and ended up in hospital with depression. Well, I am well and good now I left that place ages ago and living happily with a wife and two cute daughters. I am a lawyer now and had a happy ending. I also came to know that all the people who slept in that room ended up either dead or mad. I guess God was on my side that I ended up well.
