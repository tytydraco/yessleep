As a teenager, there were a couple of things that I never questioned: TV was the greatest invention known to humankind, plans were for suckers, and Kevin, Lanie, Martin and Louise were my friends. And I could always find them, whenever I wanted. I just had to look for the bright blue door.

I first met them when I was thirteen. I was skipping class and trying to find something fun to do. Strolling down the hallways and trying not to get caught, I noticed something near the teacher’s lounge that caught my eye. A bright blue door. I’d wandered these halls before but had never seen it before. *Weird,* given that the door stuck out like a sore thumb. Intrigued (and half-expecting it to be filled with teachers who were going to report me to the principal), I poked my head in and saw Kevin and the group for the first time. They were all seated together around a small table in what looked like a pretty cozy room. 

They perked up when they saw me but kept their composure, like I was a deer that they didn’t want to startle.

Kevin: Hey! You’re not, uh, interrupting anything. Feel free to check out the room, if you want, my man.

I saw the others shoot Kevin a weird glance, before they resumed looking at me and trying their best to seem welcoming. 

I’ll be honest: the group was pretty hard to read. 

I walked in and scanned the room to find… pretty much everything I loved. There was a candy wall, an N64 with an extensive gaming collection, a huge movie collection with a large TV (for the time), I could go on… it was exactly what a young me would’ve loved to have had in my room at home. I hung around for a bit, scoping it all out. I could tell that they were whispering about me but were trying to keep it low-key. 

This is probably a good time to mention that they were all adults. All of them looked to be somewhere around their mid-twenties. 

I had my quick tour of the room and decided to leave.

Kevin: Feel free to come back anytime man! We love to chill here.

I could sense a collective groan from the others he was seated with. I made my way, and as I closed the door, I could hear one of the others say “You’re trying way too hard!” under their breath to him.

I left the room and went on with my day. I didn’t really question why there was a group of adults (who didn’t appear to be teachers or other school staff members) hanging out in what seemed to be the *chillest* room in the universe. After all, puberty was confusing enough as it was. I had enough on my plate. Hormones, man. 

It didn’t take me too long to visit the room again. And again. And again. 

Hanging out with adults roughly twice my age was weird at first, but there was something weirdly special about Kevin and the group. They made me feel safe whenever I had the chance to see them. I was a pretty awkward and lonely kid at school, so having a consistent group of pals to talk to, even though they spoke kind of weird and were somewhat hard to relate to, was always nice.

While it’s hard to remember exact quotes of conversations we’d had, I'd visit the blue door room most days, usually after-school. Most of the time, the conversations would go like:

Lanie: So how was your day today?

Me: Good, I guess. I’m doing okay with my classes.

Martin: Are you worried about failing your classes?

Me: Uhh, kind of? Not sure.

I didn’t realize it at the time, but I think they were (unsuccessfully) trying to play therapist with me so that I’d trust them more. While their questions were weird, spending a bunch of time after school playing video games felt like a pretty sweet trade-off all in all, so I was grateful for the hangout sessions. 

Now… I wasn’t the sharpest kid. There were a couple of interesting things about this room that took me a few weeks to notice.

The first was that time would slow down *drastically* whenever I went to the room. Like… what felt like hours was really only 10 - 15 minutes.

Second was the fact that the door wasn’t always in the exact same place. It was a subtle change, but sometimes, depending on the day that I’d visit the room, I’d notice the door was further down the hallway than when I’d last visited, or even on the other side of the hallway. 

On both items, I convinced myself that my mind was playing tricks on me. Was it weird that it was always the same people in the room? Yes! Was it weird that no teachers or students would notice whenever I went there? Sure! But, amidst the chaos of growing up as a loner, it was nice to have a special place that was all my own.

For the next few months, the visits continued to be enjoyable. Just me playing video games, watching movies, eating candy, and answering questions from people who seemed to take a genuine interest in my life. 

It took a while for the group to finally start asking me their *other* questions. They started sneaking them in slowly, usually just one or two at a time.

Lanie: What’s the sky look like for you? In your real world.

Me: Uhh. Blue. Duh. Is that a trick question?

Lanie and the group would laugh.

Lanie: That’s funny! And is there anything else in the sky?

Me: Uhh, the sun? The moon sometimes? Airplanes?

Lanie: Interesting!

Most of the time, they’d laugh and nod, but sometimes I’d see them write notes after we were done with our conversation (I'd catch glimpses at times when they thought I was distracted playing video games). Just adults doing weird adult-y things, right? Maybe they just thought I was a moron and so they decided to keep their questions as simple as possible? 

…Yes, I *did* catch that mention of Lanie referring to the sky in my “real world”. I tried not to linger on that too much. They’d usually just go back to asking me about my day after their specific questions about my "real world", or would just let me lounge around while they continued to sit at their table. 

After all, they knew what would happen if they pushed it more than that.

I remember a specific conversation from one random visit:

Louise: What does everyone do when nightfall occurs?

Me: Nightfall? What?

Kevin: Like, when the sun goes down.

Me (laughing to myself a bit): Oh? Like, night time?

Louise: Yes. At the... “night time”.

Me: ....what do you mean by "everyone"?

Louise: Well… what does everyone do?

Me: I'm not sure? I think everyone's different? My parents usually want me to come home before it gets dark.

Martin: Because…

Me: I dunno, because it’s dark. It’s just kind of a thing parents say.

Louise: Do your parents go out when it's dark?

Just as I was about to answer, I started hearing a rumbling noise. Slowly, the room started vibrating, and I felt this weird skin-curdling feeling all over my body. The team looked tense, but Louise kept pushing it. She wasn’t hiding the fact that she was taking notes, either. I was tempted to hide under the table in the room (the programming from those earthquake drills in school was starting to kick in). 

Louise: So, when it’s dark outside, people still choose to leave?

Me: Yeah? Is that weird?

The rumbling intensified further. It was the first time in a while that I’d felt unsafe in the room. I saw Louise gearing up for a follow-up question, but Martin quickly intervened.

Martin: How was your day?

Me: You already asked me that.

Kevin: Well, we'd love to know again!

I let the weirdness of them repeating their questions linger. The rumbling slowly came to a stop. I saw the group’s collective sigh, and just tried to forget about it.

The visit to the room that night was weird - they all noticed it - so they played it low-key for a while. Most of my visits after that in the following months were filled with the standard fare of “how was your day”-style questions. That weird rumbling thing didn’t happen again during those hangouts, which was relieving.

From this point, years passed. And an adventurous 16 year old me was a bit more curious about this group of adults from the room with the bright blue door. 

I started subtly, mentioning this room to fellow students or teachers.

Me: Hey, have you guys met Kevin or Lanie? From the blue door room? Near the teacher’s lounge? 

The response would be crickets or a raised eyebrow. Seriously - did *no one else* know about these guys? Anytime I’d feel a sensation in my gut like I was dealing with some sort of otherworldly phenomena, I’d immediately push it down and go on with my day. 

Still, in my curiosity, sometimes before I’d enter the room, I’d spend a few minutes pressing my ear against it to see if I could hear them talking about anything. Most of the time, it was really incoherent. Not another language I didn’t understand, but really big words that they’d never use in front of me when I was in the room with them. I could never really make them out, but words that still stick in my mind are “coordinates”, “emergence”, and the one that I always heard them use the most when I wasn’t around, “timeline intervention”. In case you’re wondering what "adolescent me" thought at the time, I… just assumed it was boring “adult speak”. The same sort of language I’d tune out whenever my parents would have a serious discussion while watching the news or something. 

This was also around the time that I started developing manners, as it would so happen. So I opened one of my visits to the room with what I thought was a harmless question:

Me: Hey, I never ask you guys… how was your day?

They all looked at me, stunned. I could tell Kevin was covering when he said:

Kevin: Good! Nothing too strange. Right, guys?

They all nodded. It was here that I saw the weirdest thing. Louise was holding back tears.

A light rumbling began. Martin took her aside to the corner of the room and comforted her. 

It took a bit, but that same rumbling dwindled down as soon as it came. Kevin and Lanie tried to play it off but I knew something strange was going on.

It was only a few weeks later that Lanie asked if I could do them a quick favor. I could tell, when they asked, that there was some urgency to this request.

Lanie: Do you have binoculars?

(Keep in mind, she pronounced it like “bye-no-que-lars”)

Me: Binoculars?

Lanie: Yes. Those.

Me: Uhh… I don’t. But I can get some?

Martin: Let us know. When you have them. In your real world.

There it was again. In my “real world”. *Stop saying that - it’s making me uncomfortable.* 

Fuck it. 

I had a little bit of spending money. I decided to do what my strange friends were asking of me. I went and purchased some “bye-no-que-lars”. My parents thought it was cool that I was getting a hobby outside of video games. I withheld it from them that a group of adults twice my age that I was hanging out with in secret were having an impact on my purchasing choices.

…

Over the next few days, something incredibly strange happened. 

I went to the hallway near the teacher’s lounge to visit Kevin and the crew. I couldn’t find the door anywhere. This wasn’t the door being further down than I remembered or on the other side of the hallway either - it was just *gone.* I’d return to try to find the door every day after class but it was nowhere to be found. 

Those two empty weeks forced me to confront some questions that I’d been shoving to the back of my mind: *Why does time slow down in the room? Who the hell are these people? And why does no one know them? Why does no one talk about this place?* 

I started spiraling. Was I crazy? A weirdo detached from reality who was hallucinating a group of imaginary friends in order to feel okay about himself? 

*Relief.* 

It was a dreary day at school, but there it was - the bright blue door right where it belonged. In the hallway near the teachers lounge. All I felt was happiness. These awkward adults had become a part of my life at this point. I ignored the disappearance and reappearance of the room and any implications that had on this whole happening. I was just happy they were back. 

I went in, relieved to see them. Needless to say, they looked a little stressed but were relieved to see me too. 

But it did feel like they were a little bit out of character.

Me: Hey! This room was like… gone for a few weeks. How did that even happen?

Lanie: Please tell me you got the binoculars?

Me: What? Yeah. I got them.

Lanie: Okay, so it’s probably best you don’t hang around this room too long today.

Me: Awe, why? It’s been a couple of weeks guys, I thought we’d–

Kevin: Please. Please. Listen carefully. As a favor to us, can you watch the skies with your binoculars? And this part’s really important. Catch the sky from different angles. You’re looking for four bright stars in a diagonal line across the sky. Very bright. Brighter and bigger than the other stars. You can’t miss them.

Me: Uhh okay, I guess I can do that.

The rumbling started again. Fuck - it was always the worst feeling. 

Kevin: Sorry. I promise we’ll be more normal next time. And hang out longer. You should go on with your day. We'll speak more when we see you next, okay?

I nodded and left the room. Off I went with the rest of my dreary day.

Life was weird from this point forward. I honestly felt like I was entering a negative headspace which was permeating into everything else going on with me. It felt like this whole experience with the bright blue door was a hallucination and that I had to fess up to my parents and get checked into a mental institution or something. Nonetheless, I kind of haphazardly looked around with my binoculars from time to time. Occasionally I’d give it a good ol' college try and really try to find a line of bright stars, but it pretty much always felt like I was kind of forcing it. Never really found anything close to what they described, beyond the standard smattering of constellations.

It really felt like Kevin and the group, if they were even real, were starting to lose the plot. I mean, telling me to scan the sky with binoculars instead of a telescope? The fact that I would’ve been able to see the sky pretty clearly without binoculars anyways? It didn’t really make sense. 

Everytime I thought about all of this, it made me feel uncomfortable, so I tried to delete the whole ‘bright blue door’ thing from my subconscious. 

And… just like that… 

The room was gone? 

Right around the time I turned 17, I had my first prolonged hiatus from the room with the blue door showing up in my waking life. Maybe I was just a lonely boy hallucinating a group of friends during a weird phase of my life? Maybe realizing the whole thing was silly made it disappear? Who really knows? 

I naturally got much more invested in the internet at this time (2005). Did some googling about a diagonal line of four bright stars close together and I didn’t really find anything. I also did the thing that I’d held myself from doing all this time… and googled about that phase of puberty where you see a recurring room with a blue door that no one else can see (I googled other colors as well), with the same cast of adults in that room every time you visit. Naturally, there wasn’t a whole lot about either of those topics that I could find online. 

I’d been burying this strange experience at the back of my mind, not engaging with it honestly. I’d been dealing with some strange… paranormal, supernatural, who am I kidding, *crazy* phenomena. I’d never talked about it, because I thought that people would only think I was weirder than I already was. 

As I thought about the bright blue door more and more, a sinking feeling in my chest grew and grew.

But… 

Life went on. I scanned the sky for that diagonal line of bright stars from time to time. I’d kind of shake my head every time I did it. 

The room was just a weird hallucination. Kevin, Lanie, Martin, and Louise weren’t real. I needed to move on. 

Three years passed. Three full years.

I missed the group sometimes, despite the weirdness of it all. Don’t get me wrong - it wasn’t fun to think about having a uniquely strange paranormal experience (or psychotic breakdown). *But,* when you spend years hanging out with a group of folks every day, even if they were maybe just figments of your imagination, you naturally build some sort of connection.

And so, I had a pretty strange mix of feelings when I saw that bright blue door again. 

It wasn’t at school.

I was taking a shortcut to one of my friend’s houses through a back alleyway. And that’s where I saw it. The sight of that door shook me. Just there, in the middle of fucking nowhere basically. Nowhere I’d ever expect it, anyways. And a clear signal that whatever the fuck this was, this wasn’t normal. 

It felt like a trap. But… 

I made my way to it slowly. I pressed my ear against the door, eavesdropping for the first time in a long while.

Now, I wasn’t a brainiac, but some of their adult-speak was making a bit more sense. Some of the buzzwords I'd already heard before, but then… there was some discussion of various world events. Some were from the past, but others I was… unfamiliar with. It almost sounded like they were yet to happen (specific elections, natural disasters, etc.), and yet the group was speaking candidly about them as if they were already a done deal.  I held myself to trying to remember the specifics long enough to write them down when I woke up - more on this in a bit.

Against my better judgment, I opened the door.

There they were, Kevin, Martin, Lanie, and Louise. I was older now. They were too. Maybe I’d never noticed their subtle aging when I was seeing them daily, but it was clear now. They didn’t look great.

Despite that, they smiled to see me. And it felt real? Truly genuine. And I smiled back.

We talked for a while and caught up. They asked me about my day. I didn’t ask them about theirs (true manners, I guess?), and I sort of lounged around for a while (albeit, with my guard up). It was strange, but… it also felt like old times. I didn’t want to bring up anything serious if they didn’t want to. But I guess at some point, they had to ask.

Kevin: Did you end up looking at the sky?

Me: I… did. Quite a lot actually. I didn’t really see anything.

Kevin looked at the others and nodded. Lanie started taking notes, like old times. Not hiding it. I kind of snickered.

Me: This is weird guys. This whole thing is weird. Am I losing it? Is this a hallucination? 

Lanie: We know this is weird. No, you’re not losing it. 

Kevin: More importantly, do people still go outside? At night?

Me: Yeah. They always have. And still do. I go a lot now too. Privilege of being older, I guess.

Lanie: That’s good. Really good to know. 

Lanie continued writing.

Kevin: And, uh, this is gonna sound a bit weird, but… what city do you live in? Where people go outside at night and there’s no diagonal line of stars in the sky?

I hesitated. This question felt intrusive. 

Me: Seriously, are you guys actually real? Why are you asking me this?

It began again.

I forgot how much I hated that rumbling. The room shaking - the relics of early 2000’s stuff I loved getting thrown about the room. That unsettling “unknown” feeling crawling up your back. It came back just as I asked. The group looked at each other, worriedly. 

Lanie: If you trust us. If you know us. Please, say the name of your city.

Kevin: Please.

They all started begging me. They were desperate. I was afraid. What the fuck?

I did the thing that both seemed reasonable because I’d known them for this long and unreasonable because this was a weird fucking situation - I told them the city I lived in.

They were so relieved. I remember a few of them crying. It was kind of a blur. They wrote some notes and started talking amongst themselves - I don’t think they were trying to ignore me or anything - just that they were focused on some sort of breakthrough.

I can’t recall exactly what they were talking about, but the jist of it boiled down to them knowing something concrete. Something about a city, a year, the state of the sky and what happens at night? That it was enough information for them to maybe “change the events.”

Me: What exactly is this for, you guys?

The rumbling hadn’t subsided. They looked at me with sincere gratitude. 

Kevin: We thank you, friend. We thank you so much. It sounds like nothing, but knowing this gives us something. Something concrete. 

The rumbling was intensifying enough that it felt like the room was going to collapse. Like it was going to tear apart, somehow. They were whispering amongst each other again. They turned to me.

Lanie: A final favor. Tell the world about the diagonal line of stars. Four stars close to each other. Burning much brighter than usual. Very, very visible. Draw attention to it. They have to know. They can't miss it. They have to look at it. 

I started stumbling away from them. I don’t know why but I felt mortified. They kept saying thank you in this really emotional way. I felt afraid of them for the first time. I stumbled out of the room and fell backwards into the back-alleyway I originally came from, slamming the door as I fell out. I wanted to scream, but I didn’t. 

The next few weeks, I could barely sleep. I could barely pay attention to anything. Nothing felt real. I wasn’t in my body. Depersonalization. 

I didn’t want to see that fucking door. I was afraid Kevin and the group would show up outside of the room and find me. I was afraid I’d broken some sacred separation between my world and wherever the fuck they were coming from.

It felt like something sinister was going to happen. Like I’d given up a human secret to something non-human. Brought on the invocation of some fucking demon, or something. 

It was a bad few years. I was able to skirt on by having a “normal” enough life, but barely. I wanted to check myself into a psych ward. I wanted to tell people I needed help. I needed some fucking help. Was this whole experience in my head? *No, this was as real as fucking anything else I’d experienced.* I knew it was. 

I tried to forget it. But those fucking events they talked about when I last saw them and was eavesdropping... I’d written a list of them down from the ones that I could remember (and for the ones I couldn’t fully I still wrote some random keywords here or there), and like clockwork, they all started happening as the years went by. Some of them were predictable enough that I don’t think they were particularly special predictions, but the others were fucking specific…. and mundane, and random? I’m talking about relatively minor incidents around the globe, from random technological advances to elections in major countries that I knew next to nothing about. Keywords of things that didn’t exist before that I wrote in a misspelled fashion based on how the words sounded phonetically. 

Logically, this all wasn't coincidence. There was more than enough there to confirm that, somehow, they had communicated things to me that there was no reasonable way for me to know otherwise.

I tried not looking at that list, but every now and then curiosity would get the best of me, and Google was there for me to confirm things in real-time. *This was real.* 

It took longer than I’d like to admit for me to finally get past all of it. Maybe six years until the thought was fully gone from me? That even if something genuinely supernatural did occur to me, that it wouldn’t harm me or influence my life in any way. 

I was able to skirt on through university with mediocre-ish grades, but was ultimately able to develop a career. And have a life. And a long-term partner.

And we’re here now, in the present.

Was I still traumatized by the whole ‘Bright Blue Door’ thing? Nah. Creepy, supernatural shit happens from time to time. It was what it was. 

I have a life to live and I can’t be arsed to think about the implications of what happened to me back then. I’m busy enough as is. 

So, really, it wasn’t in the cards for me to make this post.

Until last week.

November 15, 2022.

I was visiting my parents. It wasn’t a special occasion - I just hadn’t seen them for a while. I went down the hallway to go to the bathroom, and that’s when I saw it. The bright blue door. 

There it was, in front of me. After what? 14 years? In the fucking house that I grew up in?

Would I be the dumbass who opened it again to create another paranoid spell for myself? 

Yes, yes I would be. The truth is, as scary as the whole ordeal was, I was at least a bit curious. And at this point, it felt like my neurons had been zapped from the years of anxiety anyways. I was desensitized.

I opened the door. And the room was basically the same. An N64,a collection of movies, a candy wall, and that table in the middle. Nostalgia.

Lanie wasn’t there. Neither was Martin. Or Louise. Just a disheveled, miserable-looking Kevin. It looked like he’d been crying.

He saw me, and for a brief moment, he lit up. I saw him smile. That “actually human” smile. It didn’t undercut his misery by much, but it’s something that’ll stay with me forever.

Kevin: It’s nice to see you again.

Suppressing the rational part of my brain, I sat across the table to sit with him.

Me: It’s nice to see you again too. 

(awkward silence)

Me: You know, this whole thing has been very weird.

Kevin laughed. And kind of cried.

Me: How was your day?

Kevin: It’s been bad. My life has been bad.

He looked at me sternly. For the first time, it felt like he was really talking to me as himself.

Kevin: It all gets very bad. We weren’t able to stop it. Those… beings. From the “stars”. They’ve gotten most of us.

No rumbling. But that same sinking feeling.

Me: Gotten most of you? Like... they've killed people?

Kevin laughed. I wish I could describe the laugh. Not maniacal. Not sad. Like… the laugh of someone forty floors beneath what you’d think rock bottom was.

Kevin: We're a stupid species. We think in binaries. Alive? Then dead. We convince ourselves it's brave to accept that death is pitch blackness and you cease to exist forever. What a comforting thought right? That you can get out of this situation. But it's fairytale talk. We can't escape. There is so much horror beyond death. So much we can't know.

Me: What does that even mean? 

Kevin: Exactly what I said.

Me: You have to be specific.

Kevin laughed.

Kevin: I’m ready to go. I know they’re going to locate me soon. I don’t want to be alone when they get me. Will you stay with me?

Me: Are they gonna get me too?

Kevin: No. They can only get me. It'll be in my waking life. In my timeline.

Me: I knew it. I knew you were real. I knew you were fucking real. 

The room started rumbling, but I didn’t care. I don't think Kevin cared either.

Kevin: We were trying to find a way to change our circumstances. We’d found a way to communicate with the past. But we had no control over the mechanism. Where it went or who it reached. Time or space. We have very little knowledge of the past. Most of it's been eradicated. Most of us are gone.

The rumbling intensified. Stronger than I’d ever felt it in my life.

Me: What year are you in? What year are you from?!

Kevin: You’ve got many good years, still. Be happy, and watch the stars. Pay attention. Remember this knowledge when all of you are no longer connected by the digital flow of energy. 

Me: What if we can still change the future? Like the butterfly effect?

Kevin laughed again.

Kevin: Maybe for another timeline, however that all works. But me, here, the *real* me right now, this is my only life and my only existence. I am Kevin. And they’re going to find me soon. They’re aware of threats to their existence, across all of time and space. And things beyond time and space. We're smaller than ants. It’s why we could only talk so much. Why we could only talk sometimes. Or else they would've found us sooner. 

(I said something here that was super important but I genuinely can’t remember what it was.)

Kevin: I don’t want to be alone when they get me. It’s beyond death. I don’t… I don’t mean to -

It was at this point that he started crying. 

It killed me that this guy was apologetic while being on the cusp of something this awful. It’s weird, but I ended up getting up from the table and I held him while he was still seated. The rumbling continued and he didn’t let it subside. He asked me random questions to self-soothe at this time. Questions like “What does the warmth of the sun feel like?” and “Can you describe fireworks to me please?” It felt like his questions were making the rumbling worse and worse, but I think he was sure that this was his time to go. I answered them to the best of my ability. 

The whole thing became a blur at this point, but I remember there was a point where he was just gone and I wasn't holding him anymore. The room was still intact. I was sad and mortified and confused and lonely and just… yeah.

I remembered leaving the room. I closed the door, and I was back at my parents’ house. I rejoined my parents and they were thrown off by how shellshocked I looked. I had some debris on me from the violent shaking of the room - some of which had caused a torn sleeve on my shirt and an injury on my arm that was bleeding quite heavily. It was hard to explain that one to my parents. 

I’ve been looking for the door again since then. Everywhere I go I keep my eyes peeled. No luck so far. But I won’t stop looking. 

I have so many fucking questions I wish I asked him during that last visit. I’m also working hard on just… general memory stuff, in case there were any useful tidbits I can pull from my brain to figure out more about what he was talking about. 

Naturally, I just have a skin-curdling feeling about everything. I watch the skies again when I can. Life is so routine that I’m shocked this hasn’t possessed 100% of my attention since it happened. But today has been a bit hard, so for those who made it to the end, thank you for the free therapy.

A final piece of housekeeping: I tried to organize the conversations neatly, but memories are tricky. It’s really really hard to recall the exact wording and flow of specific conversations that happened so long ago. Sometimes conversations were a mix of words and strong feelings. I tried to recall as much as I could and tried to quote whenever things were more concrete memories, but it’s very hard to provide anything like “exact quotes” from anyone. Figured that’d be clear from the jump but just wanted to reaffirm that. 

My message to my old friends from the room with the bright blue door: I hope this post can change things, somehow. I’m still looking for you. 

You know where to find me.
