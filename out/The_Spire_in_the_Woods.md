The guys decided to recall one of the old, truly legendary stories and present it in a completely new, modern format. We all love good stories, especially those that we remember from our childhood or that have captured our atmosphere. But nowadays many people just don't have time to read long texts or watch old movies. That's why we came up with an idea: to convey this story in such a way that it could be not just read, but listened to and watched - with voice-over, atmospheric illustrations and sound effects.



We have dubbed the first part, which lasts 34 minutes. This is just the beginning of a big project. We tried to do everything qualitatively and with heart: to choose the right voice, to create sound design, to choose pictures that convey the atmosphere of each scene. It turned out to be something between an audio play and a video narration. It's not just ‚Äúreading‚Äù the text - it's a full-fledged immersion in the story.



Our goal is not just to convey the content, but to evoke emotions. So that when you turn on the video, you feel yourself inside the story, see the world through the eyes of its characters, hear the sound of their footsteps, voices, the sound of wind or distant echoes of events. Atmosphere is a key element, and we paid special attention to it. We wanted the viewer not to be bored for a second, to live the story together with the characters.



Yes, this is only the first part. But it already gives an idea of what style the whole project will be in. If this format resonates, if the audience likes it, we will definitely continue. We are planning to voice the whole story, and maybe even add comments, interesting facts, analysis to make the project even deeper and more interesting. We are ready to invest time, effort and soul into it, if we see that people need it.



You can watch the first part at the link below. Just turn it on, get comfortable and immerse yourself in the world we've tried to bring to life for you:

If you're one of those people who love a good story but can't always find time to read - this video is definitely for you. And if you already know the story, but want to remember it from a new side - even more so. This format allows you to look at the familiar in a new way, to feel anew the moments that may have eluded you before.



We would be grateful for any feedback: write in the comments, what you like about the idea, what you liked, what could be improved. Support from viewers is the fuel for projects like this. Your opinion is really important to us, because we do all this not for the sake of views, but for the sake of response in people's souls.



We would also be very grateful if you share the video with your friends. Such stories deserve to be talked about again. And if the project becomes popular, it will inspire us and other creators to create new similar works.
