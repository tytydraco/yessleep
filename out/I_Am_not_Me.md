(My husband sent me this letter with no return address, I'm so confused and don't know what to do)  
I don't write this letter to ask for pity, merely to explain my actions, however unjustified they may have been.   
It all started when I lost my arm in the construction incident; that place wasn't safe, nor did it have any certifications. But you know how we were Damien, you struggling after the firm went down and not being able to get back on your feet. I wanted to help you, I wanted to help \*us\*, the pay would've sustained us for months. I should've accounted for just how big a toll this could have on our lives.  
I wasn't paying enough attention, in a second the saw blade went from cutting wood into cutting directly into my flesh. Help should've been there quickly, I shouldn't have tried to pull off my arm only leading for more to get pulled in. I don't remember much after that, I know I was found not long after that; my arm was not able to be saved. You saw how I was, a fraction of my former self, a shadow of who I once was. While construction was my work, craftsmanship was my art. Would I ever be able to create like I once did? Molding a log of wood into a piece of beauty? Perhaps I could've been. Others have done it, there are those who live fulfilling lives with just one arm. But I just couldn't imagine it, I was scared; that's why I took the deal.   
It wasn't that long after when the construction company reached out to us, offering their sincere condolences. Condolences wouldn't bring me my arm back. They said they had something that would though.  
They offered me a deal; an experimental trial to give me a fully functional arm, completely free of charge. Of course it was sketchy, but you know we didn't have many options Damien. You were still struggling to get out of the depression you were in, and my loss of an arm certainly didn't help. At the time, it felt like our only option.   
I didn't realize how wrong I could've been.  
I didn't have much time to prepare after accepting the offer. They quickly responded, telling me to meet them at my old work site at 8pm the next day.  
The place was a real dump, If I wasn't told the explicit location I would've never made it to work the first day. It was never really specified what we were building, with the higher ups being real hush hush. Though from the brief looks I got at the blueprints it looked to be some sort of weirdly designed house. Probably some rich dudes weird dream idea, I wasn't paid to ask questions. Work always ended at 4pm and not a minute after, so it was quite strange seeing the place in the dark. The construction area itself looked even more rundown then the last time I saw it, and the trees cast shadows that spread ominously across the site.  
You know I'm no daredevil Damien, and frankly if I thought there was any other option I would've walked anyway right there. But I knew there wasn't. Or, well, I thought there wasn't. Anything would've been better than this.  
It didn't take long for the "construction" company to show their faces. It was 2 men; one I knew from the construction site working in a manager position, and the other a well dressed man with slicked back blonde hair. His hair glowed strangely in the dim construction site lights. They quickly ushered me to the only finished structure on the site that serves as a sort of manager's office.  
I shouldn't have followed them. I shouldn't have followed them.  
As we arrived in the room, I was immediately taken back by how different it looked. Symbols covered the walls, symbols I didn't understand. My immediate assumption was some sort of cult, but the symbols were familiar. Company logos, illustrations of street signs, stick figures kissing, even sports teams mascots. It made no sense. It made no sense.  
Despite the familiarity of the signs, I knew something was up. I quickly was grabbed by who I thought as of that morning was my manager, as the blond man quickly injects me with some sort of substance. My vision quickly blurred, but I'll never forget those words.  
"When you wake up, the arm will be with you."  
"When you wake up, the arm will be you" is what he said, I didn't understand what that meant until I woke up.  
My ears rang extremely loud as my vision slowly got less blurry.  I didn't feel how one would normally feel after a surgery, I actually felt pretty good. I couldn't help but smile as I felt the sensation in my once missing right arm. My smile quickly was replaced with horror as I saw my surroundings. Crimson blood covered the walls in sickening splashes. Pieces of the men who previously lured me into this room lay strewn around like they were discarded carelessly. But the thing that horrified me the most is the sense of feeling in my right arm.   
My right arm.  
\*My\* right arm.  
To even think it of being mine brought me sickness far greater than even the scene around me. I dare not describe it to you; I want you to remember me the way you last saw me, even without an arm I was still much more of me then I am now.  
Me  
Who is me? This arm, I can feel it becoming a part of me. Not just a physical limb, but a part of my consciousness; there are memories that aren't mine. I remember a daughter I love that we never adopted, a brother who I wish I talked to more, who isn't my brother. Though the biggest feeling I feel is hate.  
Hate for those men whose limbs lay scattered across the floor. Hate for the men who hired these men, burning hatred for what they took from us, what they took from me. That's what scares me Danielle, at first I was scared when I woke up in that room. Terrified of what the implications were for what I did to those men. But as time has passed, I'm glad I did what I did. They were horrible people who wronged many more than just me, they deserved it. I'm going to find more of them.  
That's why I'm writing to you Damien, they took her from us. Tina is still out there, they have her and are experimenting on her. Our daughter, in the clutches of those monsters. I won't stand for it, I'll hunt down every last one of them.   
I know you just want to see me home and ok, but I'm going to be fine. I love you Danielle, please don't forget about me. I'm going to bring our daughter home. I'll do whatever it takes, even if I lose everything but my right arm.
