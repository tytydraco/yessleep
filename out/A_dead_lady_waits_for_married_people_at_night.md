So this is one of the stories my father used to tell me which he experienced in real, according to him.

Coming to the story.

It was the night of 1992, rural India. My father and mother got married that day. All was eventful and as all marriages are -- boring. The marriage and the after reception lasted till around 8 pm, when guests started leaving. It was all over by 10, but they had one problem, the car they were supposed to go back in, got seized and was not working.

For content, the place where the marriage took place was around 35kms away from home. Today the city, lets call it city of ampla, is a pretty nice and developed city, but back in 1992 it was all jungle, less vehicles and narrow roads going through shallow jungles.

Coming back, with no other option remaining, they decided to use a spare scooter which was available, and started their journey back home at around 1130 pm. Bad idea, I know, but according to them, there was no bus station nearby back then, no cars and cabs, as it was a pretty reral area. So they started their journey.

Around after 15 mins, their rear tyre was punctured. Thankfully, it was an old vespa with a spare tyre hanging on the back side of the scooter. My father replaced the tyre, and started the journey again. Again, after 15 mins, their tyre was punctured. With no spare tyre left, they were stranded in the middle of road at night. After a few minutes another scooter was passing by, which stopped to help them. The other scooter guy gave them their spare tyre, and rode with them to the next tyre repair shop, where they repaired both punctured wheels. All was well, and they both were riding together. After a while there was a big bridge in front of them, with river flowing below it. While crossing the road, suddenly both tyres of both of the scooter blasted away, and they almost fell into the river. There were no signs of any nails, robbery or anything. The tyres simply gave away, again. 

Then, they heard. A scream, of a lady, like she is drowing, in pain. They wanted to run, but there was no light, and honestly, nobody will have that strong will power. It was terrific, but it wanted them to jump into the river. They almost did it, but the spell or whatever it is was broken by a commercial truck crossing the road. The truck stopped and the driver got down, confused. He asked them what they were doing, to which my parents and the stranger replied they had a blasted tyre. But their scooters were in the middle of the road, and they were standing on the edge of the bridge. 

The truck driver knew what was happening, he towed their scooters on the back bed and gave them a lift till home. When everybody back home were relieved as they were worried because it was almost 2 in the morning, they asked the truck driver what happened. He told them:  


"There was a lady who commited suicide on the bridge after her husband cheated on her. SInce then she targets newlyweds crossing the bridge at night. My parents almost died but were found at the right time"

This was the end, and afterwards nobody dared to travel on that road again, specially at night. Until a new road was made, few more deaths happened on that road, after which the old route was completely closed down and a new highway was made. The old route and the bridge is still visiblle from the new highway from far away, with nature taking back everything and leaving a haunted old road there.
