“Hello I will be using fake names in my story I am 
This is all real in case any of you guys are wondering
And I have never done writing like this before so it may be a bit messy my apologies”






So me and my girlfriend eve started dating on the 16th of January 2024. We were in high school when we started to date she asked me out in the beginning of high school. But I had a girlfriend at the time so I denied. Fast forward 2 years and eve tells her friend who I was also friends with. Let’s call her Alex. And Alex tells me she still has a crush on you and I didn’t have a girlfriend anymore by then so I went to her and asked her out. And she said yes.

Fast forward a few months and the first red flag came up. She was still in contact with her ex and then I questioned this and she said because he was a family friend. So then I said if you met with him would you let him make a move on you. And she  said yes because i would be so used to it so then I said no I don’t want to risk that and broke up with her. Then later that day she made a new Snapchat account and added me on and she begged me to come back with her. I’m not sure why I agreed fuck me I wish I never came back to her at that point but I did. Fast forward a few weeks her boy best friend told eve he loved her. I wasn’t ready comfortable with that so I asked for her to stop talking to him and she agreed. But then a day later I found out she lied and I got a bit mad a went on her phone and blocked him myself. 

Fast forward a few weeks. She became friends with an other ex and I was not happy about that just so you guys know it’s not the same guy let’s call him champ. So then she met up with him as friends after that I made the first move on her then we well you know. Fast forward a few months and I was around him and my friend let’s call him Garry. Now Garry and me walked past her ex and he said. Look it’s the guy who fucked eve and he just laughed. Later that day I questioned on her about that and to my horror she said no he didn’t fuck me but he fingered me. So I got really pissed like really pissed and I live about 30 minutes away from her and I don’t have a driving licence so I took the bus with a BB gun in my waistband. I told my friend Garry and he got his snap so I added him and he said he didn’t know what she was in about.

So I said I wanted to meet up with Garry and then eve wanted to meet up with me to comfort me and for some reason I agreed. I then met up with her and we talked about it then I said ok go away I’m going to meet Garry so then she said no so I got on the bus again and saw met up with Garry with eve following me. And then we had a good time together all 3 of us and I  forgot about the incident then later on I wanted to clear my head and for everyone to leave me alone for a bit and as a good friend Garry was he did but eve did not.
And then I got reported missing because I did not come home that night because I wanted to think what to do with her. And she would it leave me alone so I rang the police and said hay I am at this location can you pick me up and take me home and take my girlfriend home too and they came and picked me up and eve too. 

I’m it sure why but I kept talking to her because at that point I loved her so many I could not let her go. I got home at 3 am and the next morning I went on holiday for a week with my parents and when I was there I met a girl called nieve. Me and nieve chatted for a bit then there was a bit of a vibe so we exchanged Snapchats and went back to the holiday house. The next evening me and Nieve were texting and things got I bit spicy and she invited me over and well we did stuff then the next day when i was going home. Me and her agreed we would keep talking and I told eve about how I met this nieve girl but I didn’t tell her what me and her did. 

Fast forward a few weeks and me and eve were dating still and then she was in the police cadets and then she met this guy and I like him and there and then I broke up with her and blocked her on everything later that day I added her back. And said can you block him and we can keep dating and she said no but I didn’t block her again for some reason. And I told her the next day I wanted to see this guy for myself and I met up with her that week and and I wanted to see him at police cadets I walked past the door to it and he saw me and got frightened and told one of the police cadets leaders and then started to walk over to me so I ran away. 

Later that week I met up with her again and we were not dating not friends but she was still talking to him at this point and me and eve went to a car park rooftop and I was talking to her about it and I said what would you do if I jumped off this roof and she said nothing to it so I then I told her about what me and nieve had done when I went to holiday and she got pissed like really pissed. And she had a lighter on her so she ran up to me and set my hoodie on fire and quickly took it off and put it out and then I said look I’m sorry but it was kinda revenge. 
And then she showed me her texts with the guy she likes and she was sending stuff to him and she was showing me him if you know what I mean.
So I pushed her phone away out of my face and it hit her lip and somehow busted her lip and a apologised. And she said yeah I’m sorry too and we hugged it out and then we locked eyes and we moved are faces closer and kissed and I pulled away and I was like wow that just happened. 
Then we walked to get food and it was late by then and then I got reported missing again and I went on eve’s phone when we were getting food and texted the guy saying I just made out with her so back off. 
And he said ok ok I will. 

And then a few minutes later she saw I did than and stormed out on me and I followed her to go out of the restaurant and go get picked up by my parents and when I was going to meet them a police car stopped next to me and they got out and pointed a taser at me and pined me on the ground and I thought it’s because I’m missing. But no I got charged of assault stalking and threatening to kill.

I then spent 32 hours in a police cell and then I got let out and told my side of the story and I told them she tried to kill me by setting me on fire they didn’t give a shit one bit but I got bail and it was I couldn’t talk to her but I wanted to know why.

A week later I texted her and then we never stopped talking at that point. And we met up a few times and I got back with her well I was on bail and my bail conditions were I was not spot speak to her. So we had to keep it under the radar.

She had stopped talking to the guy ages ago and when I questioned her about why I was arrested she said her parents made me make a fake report about me saying I hit her and at that point she was trying to get the charges dropped against me. 

But then we got seen together and I ran away form the police and she wanted to meet me and make sure I was okay. And the police were looking for me and her because we were both reported missing we didn’t come home for 3 days and when I did the police came over and said they could arrest me but chose not to because I went missing for that long. 

A few days the charges got dropped so i could go open about are relationship. 

A few weeks later I was at school with eve and she started to get pissed over something I can’t remember what though. And she left the school grounds and because I loved her I went after her and she didn’t want to come home that night so i explained to my parents why I was not going to come home and they were worried of course. But fine with it. 
But her parents were not and I’m not going to give much on her background but this is important she lives with her mum and stepdad but dad was abusive to her and her mum a they got a restraining order against him and for some reason her mum told her dad and he rang up the police and said can I go looking for my daughter and for some god reason they said yes so he was into bad stuff and knew people like that and he tracked us down and banged on the garage door.

 Me and eve found this about garage and it was abandoned but it was a nice spot but really nothing was there in the garage.

But he banged on the door and he said to me he better have life insurance and stuff like that and eve got in front of me. At that point her stepdad and her mum got to this garage and I got in the car and eve and her dad was having a fight not big just a few slaps but then I got home and he threatened me he was going to come to my house. So I couldn’t sleep for days after that. 

A few days later me and Garry went to the garage and got all my old belongings. A few weeks later me and eve were at school and she told a teacher about me doing something bad like running down the hallway so I changed her name on my snap to snitch as a joke of course but she didn’t find that funny and she went over too 2 guys and got there Snapchat in revenge so I got pissed and went around the school punching doors and windows I didn’t brake anything of course but then I had a mental break in the school car park because of it I loved her so much it’s so hard to explain how much and hard I do love her then I left the school and got reported missing by the school and eve told me where and you i want to apologise so i told her where I was.

But instead of her coming the police came and took me home after she told me she would never tell anyone anything if you didn’t and too.

But whatever I forgive her. 
Fast forward a few weeks later she is talking to this guy and he said why don’t you come over to my house and let’s fuck and she shows me this and I’m like wow block him please so she did then I moved out of the school and went to college because I got expelled for my little rampage so I got sent to college instead.

The first day of college she texted me to say she was hanging out with this guy but in school so I got pissed and left college and went home. 

I did block her but I didn’t break up with eve. 

Fast forward a few months and this was around Christmas time and she told me she wanted to see me on Christmas Day but I was going to see my family that day and for the week so I said no. 

Now you must know she is very manipulating and controlling I don’t wan to get into how she was because I don’t want to think of those memories again.

So for one mouth straight she manipulated me until I agreed and made me feel bad and all that so I agreed. 

Now she said you should take your dad’s car and come see me and after one mouth of her nagging on about it I gave up and agreed my biggest mistake ever. 

I left at 1 am in the morning and drove over to her house and picked her up now it was Christmas morning at this point and I knew my mother was going to come in my room and put presents in my stockings so I dropped her off and drove home I knew she always did it at 4 am it was 3:30 am. I I picked up the speed to 60 mph. 

And this other car was coming along and I turned the wheel a bit more in my lane but the the cars lane assist put me back where I was and the other car was a bit over the line and then I could not avoid it I crash at 60 mph head on. I woke up and got out the car and I thought I was the only one in the crash I had a concussion and I couldn’t see a other car so i thought I just crash into a tree I was only 2 miles away form my house. So I walked home with my dads car on the side of the road crashed with the warning lights on and I texted eve about it and she didn’t care one little bit I got in an argument about it like why did you do this and she said my bad.

  So I went home and the car was reported stolen and the police came around and I chose to say I stole it and the police took me to the hospital and then the police station for a interview and that’s when I got told there was a second car in the crash and I got put on bail well they were investigating the crash.

Fast forward a few months me and eve are still together and I had the trial coming up. And then I went to it and got 30 hours of community service. 

Then exactly one week later I was going around to see eve and the night before I had to give in most of my money to the court. So I was basically broke.

I must add she didn’t like me to spend money on her but when she saw something she liked she always begged me to buy her it I always gave in because if I didn’t she would keep going on about it. And I come form a rich family and she does not but I don’t want to think she was using me for my money but a lot of people have said I she was my friends my family help person and my counsellor I don’t want to believe it but I kinda do.

But anyway yeah I was going to see her one week after my court visit I woke up and I was blocked on everything right after I told her the night before I was broke I went around to her house and she opened the door and said she never wants to be with me again. 
So I went home after a few days then she contacted me at night with a other guy in her bed now I have never been cheated on so this hit me really hard even if me and eve were not together. 
I felt so shit I hat to contact hotline if you know what I mean so I would not yeah. I blocked her again them just a few hours ago she rang me up and it was with him and I asked a few questions and we left on a good note with him. but eve I hate her she used me controlled me manipulated me and took all my friends away took my dream job away since I have a criminal record now can’t go on vacation to other countries she is psychopath I honestly think that and good luck to her new boyfriend because he won’t last a month with her. 
The only reason why I couldn’t leave I had some really bad trauma when I was young when I had attachment issues and couldn’t leave people alone I don’t really aka tot get into. But that’s the only reason why I stayed but with a lot of help from  my family and social workers I’m getting over her. But I hated when she called me a few hours but now she is blocked on everything.
And she can’t contact me ever again 


Now there’s a lot of stuff I missed out because I dot. Want this to be long but she was crazy like really crazy she was on drugs and smoked and I always wanted to go into the police so I hated that. But sometimes when I threatened to leave her and I  tried to end the relationship she threatened her life and blackmailed me sometimes. 

And I told my social workers my parents this and all of my closest people and they have all said you were in a toxic relationship I want to know your opinion though. 

Leavening on a good point I’m going back on holiday soon and I’m going to see Nieve again and I’ll ask her out and I hope she says yes but i don’t know I don’t want to move on yet so I’ll think about it and come back on this account and post an update. 
I’m not sure if this is going to blow up but 


I want to hear your opinion and advise thank you for listening
