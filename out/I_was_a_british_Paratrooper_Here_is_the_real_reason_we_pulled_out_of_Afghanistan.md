My name is Alfie. I am 25 years old. The first thing I would like to establish is that I had a hard childhood. I was beaten by an abusive dad and spent the little freedom I had hanging around with the wrong kind of people. The kind of people who were getting arrested, getting hospitalised or getting stabbed in a back alley. When I was 17, my best friend was arrested and convicted of armed robbery  and second-degree murder after he killed a shopkeeper over Â£500. That was enough motivation for me to escape this life. I ran away to my aunt's house a few miles away from my town, and she took me in. My dad didn't try to get me back, he simply didn't care. 

I decided to Enlist in the Parachute Regiment in the british army in hopes of escaping a life of gang violence and crime for good. During training I met another fella who came from a similar background. His name was Tom and he was 18, just under a year older than me. We quickly got close and became mates, and would chat at NAAFI (the canteen) and we would pair up with eachither whenever we had a choice to. 

Fast forward 2 years after I got my Maroon Paratrooper beret, and my Platoon received news that our Company was deploying to Afghanistan. Me and Tom, being the best friends and Platoon-mates we were by that point, were rather unaffected by this. After all, we had little-to-nothing to stay for. We were shipped off around a month later to a Base near Kabul, and went on daily patrols through the city and the surrounding areas. We rarely came under fire, and when we did our superior training and firepower meant we had minimal casualties. That was, however, until a patrol on a cloudy day in July 2020.

It was just a regular friday. Nothing too weird or out of the ordinary about our briefing, we were just told we were to investigate an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city after reports of suspicious activity in the area. It took us maybe 30 minutes to get from the Base to the building, and there weren't and fences, traps or rubble around so we headed towards the entrance. The Platoon commander, Leuitenant Grey, gave us the order to Go Firm and take a knee. We took a minute to rest whilst Lt Grey and Sergeant Watkinson, the Platoon 2IC (2nd in command) discussed the plan of action for entering and searching the building. I looked over at Tom, who was taking a drink of water. He noticed I was looking and made intense eye contact before picking his lips. He was a strange guy but a good friend none the less. He cracked a smile before mouthing "wanker" and pointing at Lt Grey. An inside joke amongst a few of us, after we caught him in a portable toilet one time, but that's a whole other story. We got given the order to prepare to move, and stood up before advancing through an open garage door into the warehouse.

The air was thick and warm, with the only light illuminating from the open doorway and some windows high up on the walls. We walked as a group into the middle, then split up into sections of around 10 to search the area for anything suspicious. Tom strolled next to me, sighing as we headed to a far corner with the rest of our section.

"What are we even supposed to be looking for?" He asked under his breath.

"Fuck knows. If you see anything that probably shouldn't be an abandoned warehouse then that's probably it" I replied.

We searched around the building for a good half hour before one of the Lance Corporals came across a small hatch buried underneath torn up files and paper. The platoon gathered round as he opened it up. Underneath it lay a small ladder leading to a dimly lit hallway. Lt Grey had one section use a mirror to look through and spot any traps, and we were given the all clear to head down. Me and Tom were 3rd and 4th to enter the hallway, and waited for the rest of our section (and another section accompanied by the Platoon Commander and 2IC) as the remaining soldiers stood guard around the hatch.

We continued down the hallway before coming to a fork with 5 different passages. We were split into groups of 4, my group consisting of myself, Tom, A lance corporal called Jackson and a private called Luke. We took a passage at random and wandered for 5 minutes or so round corners before coming to a staircase going even deeper underground. The walls through here were panelled like a hospital, and it was creeping me the fuck out. I hated hospitals. At the bottom of the staircase was a stretcher, the kind they had on wheels for moving patients around. Even creepier. Me and Tom gave eachother a look before we carried on moving down the hall past the stretcher. We had made it maybe 20 yards before a loud, agonising "FUCK!" Echoed through the entire building, followed by a series of incoherent yells and screams of pain and fear. Jack looked at us all and mouthed "what the fuck". He pulled out a radio and held down the button.
"This is Charlie 2, Did anyone else hear that? Over." He asked nervously.

"Charlie 2 this is Charlie 3," the voice of Sergeant Watkinson rang out through the radio, "yes, it sounded like it came from one of the other passages, over."

"Should we withdraw, over?" Jack's voice began to break slightly.

"No, continue to-" Sergeant Watkinson was cut off by static.

"Say again? Over" Jack said.

Silence on the other end. 

Jack looked up at us. 
"He said no." 
We kept going down the hall, this time much more awake and alert to our surroundings. The walls were surprisingly clean and undamaged, which was weird if this place was meant to be abandoned. I held my SA80 Rifle much closer and pulled it into my shoulder, ready to fire if needed. The air became much cooler and gave me goosebumps. Tom became pale and was taking deep breaths in an attempt to stay calm and collected.

We turned a corner and saw a silhouette standing still in the middle of the dimly lit hallway. We yelled at it to put its hands over its head, in English, Dari and Peshto, but it remained still. We kept yelling, and began to approach it. When we got closer, we saw the figure was a man facing away from us, and it was wearing a surgical coat and a hairnet. We grabbed him and pulled his back, but saw empty eyes and an empty smile. And I mean literally empty. He had no eyeballs, no teeth and no tongue. I checked for a pulse but found nothing. We had been yelling at a dead body that had somehow been standing up straight.

Jack attempted to radio in and report the discovery, but was yet again met with silence. This time common sense kicked in, and we withdrew (which is the fancy way of saying that we ran as fast as we humanly could through the hallway and back up the staircase) and jogged down the passageway back to the fork. 

"Lads! SOMEONE! PLEASE!" Jack yelled. His voice Echoed through the passages but was met with no response. That was, until, we heard a loud cough coming from the passage next to the one we went down. We wandered throught the doorway towards the source of the noise, and saw the shape of Sergeant Watkinson standing at the end of the passageway. 

"Sergeant!" Tom called out. No response.

"Uh... Sergeant Watkinson?" I called out, much less confident than Tom had originally been.

Still nothing.

We approached him cautiously. Grabbing his shoulder, I felt a cold tremble in his bones. I pulled him gently and he toppled backwards. We were met with the sight of his eyeless stare and toothless grin. I yelled out and stumbled backwards into Tom's arms.

"WHAT THE FUCK-" Jack screamed. We sprinted back out to the fork and back out to the ladder, and chambered through the hatch. We gasped for air, and looked around. Something was off.

"Where's the section that was standing guard?" Tom asked.

That was it. They were missing. Maybe they went to investigate the scream. My train of thought was derailed when I noticed something else.

"Where's Luke?" I asked.

"Shit..." Jack signed.

"I know we're all brothers in this Platoon, and I don't mean to sound like my balls ain't dropped yet, but I am not going back in there to find him." Tom shivered as he spoke. 

"I agree. Let's go back to Base and report in, then they can send a search and rescue team in to find him and anyone else still in there."

We must have looked like complete idiots sprinting through the city and through the slums on the outskirts of Kabul back towards the Base. But we were too busy thinking about whatever happened to worry about what civilians were thinking. We got to the gate and were let in, then began running again to get to the Company Commander's office.

"Enter" the voice of Major Tomilson called out.

Once inside we explained the entire ordeal to him. Much to our surprise, he went pale and not once accused us of lying or joking around. In fact, he told us that another member of our Platoon had come in just an hour ago and told him almost the exact same story, and that he had witnessed Sergeant Watkinson grasping his throat before kneeling down and gagging. He then apparently stood up and smiled whilst his own eyes folded in on themselves and his teeth fell back into his throat. Two other members of the section then suffered the same fate before he ran back through the exit only to find the guard section missing. 

A few days later we received word that we were being sent home, and then the British ended up pulling out of Afghanistan not long after. I still have nightmares about the empty faces of our Sgt and the civilian in the coat. As for the rest of the section, they were reported missing in action and haven't been found at all. I tried to find a record of the incident on the government website and the Company HQ but found nothing. Major Tomilson was discharged and (from what I hear) is now homeless after losing all his money to a heroin addiction. The soldier who first escaped from the compound ended up shooting himself during a training day at the shooting range after yelling incoherently about Sergeant watkinson and some other soldiers who went missing.

Tom and I left the army 3 months ago and are living together in a flat not too far from Jack's house. we still meet up regularly to go out drinking and try to drown out the memory of that day. I still don't know what happened in that warehouse or what caused it. But I do know this- nothing will convince me that it didn't happen. Not the government, not the staff at Company HQ. Nothing.
