I still remember that night when we were kids and lying down in our beds at 1 AM without being able to sleep we made a pact, the one that died first would make every possible attempt to come back and tell the other one what happens after you die and no matter what it could cost us, we will return.



It was something we would remind ourselves from time to time during our time together.

 

Me and my brother were always very close to the point that people would think we were twins, we dressed the same and be together all the time and something strange we developed was that we would always know what the other one was thinking or what he was going to say next something that I guess is normal when people spend that much time together.

 

Tragedy came to our family some years later when my brother passed away because of a car accident and I felt in a way like my life or at least a big part of myself was also gone, never before did I felt this type of overwhelming loneliness because He was someone I thought I would always had with me and in just an instant he stopped existing.

 

That night during the wake I remembered our agreement, but I didn’t give it that much importance as it was just something I remembered fondly. I got close to the casket to say my goodbyes and I wished him well and if there is anything after this life then he would enjoy it.

 

The next days were difficult for me because the emptiness is something you can’t explain but you can feel it in with you.

 

Years passed and life keeps moving on and even though sometimes I would remember him the more time it passed the less he was present in my mind, life just keeps substituting dead people and even the feelings start to go away from our memories.

 

I remember the first time it happened

 

I couldn’t sleep that night so I just stayed there in my bed alone with the lights already turned off but my eyes opened and I started to get that feeling that someone is watching you, a feeling I can’t explain but we all have had it at some point. I was scared without knowing exactly why and I felt my heartbeat getting faster and faster, I heard some steps on the next room and I hesitated for a second but I assure to myself that the outside door was locked so I looked around and noticed how the mirror in the wall was fully black like if it had been painted so that no reflection could come from it, at that moment I heard how the steps were getting closer and closer to my bedroom door and slowly the door started to get open like if I was being opened with precaution, I didn’t had any time to have a reaction so I just stayed frozen in the bed waiting and wishing everything was just my imagination. I wanted to know who was outside my door and when the door fully opened I was shocked, it was him my brother in the same form as I last saw him many years ago like if time didn’t passed for him, he entered the room and when our eyes crossed he gave me a big smile, even though it was a big smile I knew him enough to realize there was no real happiness behind that smile, he walked into the room and sat down in a chair and stared at me with his big fake smile.

 

He seemed happy in a way like if he had finally fulfilled his promise of returning after so many years and I must accept that after my initial scare at that moment seeing him in front of me again made me feel so much happiness, he didn’t had to say anything because I knew that smiled and what it meant so I sat down in the corner of my bed enjoying the moment with him finally being together again just like we had planned many years ago

 

Neither of us made any attempt to communicate with each other because it was as if the both of us knew what was happening and soon after he stood up and walked straight into a corner of the room that was the darkest area of the room and he went into the shadows and disappeared.

 

That night I couldn’t sleep remembering all the time we had spent together and had this feeling of security like if I had realized that I was not alone in this world anymore since my brother was still with me and I didn’t know if I would see him again, but I knew he was watching me.

 

Years passed and it sounds strange, but I had almost forgotten the event and I must admit that a part of me always felt that it was just a dream. My life had changed a lot during this time, I got married and divorced and in the middle part had a son that now took most of my time when he was with me, and it was around this time that he came back. I had days without being able to have a good night sleep and I started to feel like someone was watching me during my restless nights lying in bed and I would say to myself that it was just insomniac paranoia to keep myself calm but deep down I knew what was coming.

 

That night while I was trying to fall asleep but had my eyes wide open I saw this movement outside my window that I couldn’t see exactly what it was because of the drapes being closed but it was a big object that suddenly stopped in front of the window, I was in an almost unconscious state like when you are about to fall asleep and can’t move anymore but you are still hearing clearly what is happening.

 

I was about to get up from my bed when I saw this light coming into my room from the window and it move inside until it touch a mirror, there was this hitting sound on the mirror glass like if it had been touched by a coin and that took me out of my semi unconscious state, I looked around but I didn’t see anything different until I realized that the mirror was not reflecting anymore and it was only showing solid black color. I felt again his stare on my back so I turned around and I could see him between the shadows of the dark corner, he spoke and I noticed that his tone had changed to a more low tone like a more mature voice even though his pauses and rhythm was the same as I remember him.

 

“Help me”, he said without doing any movement, as if his image was just a memory of mine but he might not actually be there, his tone was soft and calm but there was some desperation in it.

 

“It is cold here and it is always dark.”

 

The room was extremely silent like if time had freeze and there was no sound of any kind being produced at that moment, I started walking towards the darkness of the room when I heard my son crying and his sound made me come out of this state of isolation feeling like if all of a sudden I was in control again and I found myself standing but didn’t remember exactly why I was there so I turned the lights on and didn’t saw anything out of place, I went to the crib and pick up my son and hold him until he fell asleep again so I lay him down and turn the lights off.

 

I returned to my bed and immediately the feeling of being watched returned, so I closed my eyes trying to forget everything when I heard this very soft murmur my way.

 

“I want to rest now”

 

I felt like if he was talking just in front of my face and I could even feel his warm breath touching my skin, I wanted to believe I was just dreaming and kept my eyes closed.

 

“I need your help; can you help me?”

 

Almost as a reflex I moved my head affirmatively and I opened my eyes, but I couldn’t see anyone in the room, so I closed them again.

 

“Remember when we used to play in the backyard of our grandma house, that time when we decide to hide and it took our parents hours to find us, how angry they were and said they had almost called the cops to notify we had been taken”

 

I felt how my brain got filled of satisfaction for an instant by him sharing with me this moment we had lived together so much time ago and I felt such joy of having him back again with me, without opening my eyes I responded

 

“Do you remember that Christmas night when we decided to secretly open our gifts days in advance just to see what every box had inside, how our stupid little cousin found out and got us punish the whole season”

 

I heard his laugh again just as I remembered it with the same innocence that he still had and I felt this profound relief because I was sure now he was my brother back with me

 

“I need your help fast, put this coin under your son while he is sleeping”

 

What he asked scared me and I immediately opened my eyes and for my surprise there was an old coin over the blanket, it was heavily used but had no identifiers, just a round piece of old metal and I did not understood what was happening so I quickly turned the lights on and looked around the room focusing on the crib where my son was still sleeping, I thought if I should put the coin beneath him just to help my brother because I knew him to well and knew he wouldn’t dare hurt my son. He sounded so desperate, but I decided not to do it and turned the lights off.

 

“You are not going to help me?”

 

He asked me in a very sadden tone but from there on he started to sound angry and accusatory.

 

“I’m here because of you because of your idea and now I can’t go back now they are following me”

 

I did not understand anything, who could be looking for him and for what reason? Who or what was he running from? I decided not to say anything and just kept my eyes closed

 

He was now yelling at me and I felt his breath crushing against my face like if he was just in front of me.

 

“I need him, give him to me, they are looking to me and they will find me, I was not supposed to come back”

 

I kept my eyes closed and his voice just disappeared after that

 

Some weeks had passed when he returned.

 

I was in my bed with my son sleeping in his crib next to me and since that last encounter I really wished all of it was just my imagination and that it would never happen again, I turned off the lights and immediately I could see a dark silhouette sitting on the corner sofa.

 

The night lights from the city entered the room through the window and in that almost full darkness I could see his eyes reflecting the light making them the only visible thing in the corner, I got scared when I saw that figure and those shining eyes moving slowly from one side to another until they finally stood still focusing on me, I turned the lights on and there he was again but he was different even though I recognized him quickly he was also older at an age he never got to be alive, our eyes looked at each other and he smiled at me and just after that his eyes started to wonder again looking at the room.

 

I tried to get up of my bed but I felt very dizzy and almost fell and in those movements trying not to go down to the floor I knocked off a glass of water that was next to my bed and I realized how the water started to go from the cup up to the ceiling drop by drop, as I could I lay down on the bed.

 

He didn’t move at all like if he was stuck on that chair he started talking to me without looking at me, he asked me if I remember past events we had together when we were children and he seemed to remember very clearly all this events but there was something unsettling in how he spoke without any emotion or expression, everything spoken in the same monotonous tone without looking at me only moving his eyes but not knowing where to lock his eyes to

 

“I need your help brother”

 

Something was really off this time, so I just stayed quiet

 

“Help me, you only have to repeat after me”

 

I got scared seeing how his eyes were now completely black and he started saying things in a language I did not understand, if he was in problems I wanted to help him in any way so I started repeating the noises he was making until I decided to stop doing this since I had no idea of the consequences.

 

“Brother do not be afraid, I will never hurt you”

 

He said this in a completely different voice like if he was a different person now

 

“Just repeat after me, is from the bible it will help me finally get some rest”

 

I completely stopped in horror when I saw how a group of people had now appeared in the room standing next to him, they were all dressed in different styles of clothing and seem to be of different ages. I still felt very weak and I felt I couldn’t distinguish what was real and what could I just be hallucinating so I closed my eyes for what it felt like a second but when I opened them again I saw my “brother” had stood from the chair and was moving directly to the crib and looked at my son sleeping.

 

“Repeat after me” he told me “You have to hurry, they found me!”

 

I stayed quiet since I had decided not to repeat anything because I didn’t knew anymore who or what he was, he had dropped to the floor like he had lost all his energy but try to crawl to me and he was extending his arms trying to touch me even though he was far away that this was impossible but he was doing it more like out of desperation, I could see his body for the first time at least what was visible through the darkness, this thin skeleton like arm stretched and his arm had almost no muscle on it just bone and I could see his pointy spine covered by his colorless and  almost transparent skin, he looked up at me and his face was very different from the face that I remembered because he had this expression of fear and like a reptile following desperately his first prey in days he move violently almost instinctively of survival towards me, his eyes were bigger and bulgier almost too big for his skull they were big and wide completely open looking at me and begging me with his look

 

“You have to help me”

 

He yelled at me, the people that were in the room with him had disappeared now.

 

He kept asking for help sounding more desperate every time he asked

 

“Help me, Help me!”

 

He was yelling looking directly at me stretching his hand and I realized he was disappearing, if he was my brother there was no way he could hurt me in any way I thought so I took the coin and put it below my son that was sleeping, I looked at my brother that was still in the floor and I could see a smile in his face, a smile I couldn’t interpret and never seen him do before and then he just disappeared going back into the darkness of the room.

 

Time has passed and I still remember his face of desperation. I have never seen someone looking like that and sometimes when I look at my son there is a part of me that can see him in there but I now regret having done this since I have seen my son also do that same smile that my brother did at the end and I don’t know if he was actually my brother or if there is someone else in there now.
