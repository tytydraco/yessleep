  
The shrill ring of the alarm clock jolted me awake, my heart pounding against my ribs like a frantic drum. The events of the previous night still haunted my thoughts, casting a pall of dread over the dawning day.  
  
I dragged myself out of bed, my legs heavy with exhaustion and anxiety. The morning light seemed harsher, more intrusive, as if the world was conspiring to amplify my fear.  
  
My fingers trembled as I reached for the computer, the cold metal of the keyboard sending a shiver down my spine. I braced myself for the inevitable, half-expecting the grotesque visage of the virus to leering back at me from the screen.  
  
But the screen was blank, a stark canvas devoid of the malicious entity that had invaded my digital life. A wave of relief washed over me, but it was a momentary respite, a fragile truce in a war that was far from over.  
  
I knew the virus was still out there, lurking in the shadows of the vast digital realm, waiting for an opportunity to strike again. It was a silent predator, a digital menace that could strike from any corner of the cyber world.  
  
The days that followed were a blur of paranoia and fear. I avoided my computer, the once familiar device now a source of dread. I flinched at the sound of the phone, my mind conjuring images of the virus slithering through the wires, seeking to ensnare me once more.  
  
I was a prisoner in my own home, my freedom curtailed by the invisible shackles of fear. The virus had not just infected my computer; it had infected my mind, leaving me paralyzed by a constant state of unease.  
  
One night, the weight of my fear became unbearable. I had to find a way to break free from the virus's grip, to reclaim my life from its clutches.  
  
With trembling hands, I sat down at my computer, the familiar keys feeling alien beneath my fingertips. I didn't know what I was doing, but I had to try something, anything to escape the suffocating grip of fear.  
  
I scoured the internet for information on computer viruses, desperately seeking a weapon against the digital menace. But the vast expanse of the web offered no solace, no solution to my predicament.  
  
As despair began to creep in, a glimmer of hope emerged from the depths of an online forum. A user recounted their tale of triumph over a computer virus, detailing how they had crafted a program that could detect and neutralize the malicious code.  
  
A flicker of determination ignited within me. I would create my own antivirus, my own shield against the digital onslaught.  
  
For hours, I poured my energy into the task, my fingers dancing across the keyboard, weaving lines of code like a desperate plea for salvation. Finally, the program was complete, a testament to my resilience and determination.  
  
I took a deep breath, my heart pounding with a mix of anticipation and trepidation. I launched the program, its digital tendrils reaching into the depths of my computer, searching for the elusive virus.  
  
After what seemed like an eternity, the program found its quarry. The virus, once a formidable foe, now cowered before the power of my creation. With a decisive click, I unleashed the program's destructive force, banishing the virus from my system once and for all.  
  
A surge of relief washed over me, the oppressive weight of fear lifting from my shoulders. I had done it. I had defeated the virus, reclaimed my life, and emerged victorious from the digital battlefield.  
  
I shut down my computer, the screen fading to black, a symbol of the darkness that had been dispelled. I crawled into bed, exhaustion finally claiming me, and drifted off into a sleep free from the clutches of fear. For the first time in weeks, I slept soundly, a prisoner no more.  


Y'know, until I woke up in a cold sweat and heard an ad for Shingrix at 2:00 AM.

  
Coming from my computer.
