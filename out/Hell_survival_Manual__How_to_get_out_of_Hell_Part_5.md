If you missed my grand entrance into the silver city, [I recommend reading my last post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cq76qu/hell_survival_manual_the_silver_city_part_4/)

If nothing here makes sense to you, start from the very [beginning.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c298x2/hell_survival_manual_everything_you_need_to/)

I apologize for the long period without news. I received an unexpected visit, and because of it, I was bedridden for quite some time. I'm grateful that my boss saw everything happen—I mean, saw what he *thought* was happening—and assured me that I would receive financial assistance while I recover.

Did you know that if you don't have most of your documents, the hospital bombards you with questions? It's pretty obvious, isn't it? It's a shame I didn't think of that while I was being taken there; I could have jumped out of the car and avoided the headache.

Jokes aside, the last few weeks have brought me answers. Maybe I have a chance to correct some mistakes. Maybe all of this wasn't just a desperate final act to gain favor with the Lord. This place has been much more useful than I anticipated.

Today's post is important because I finally have the chance to talk about the most precious information one can have when condemned to the abyss: **how to escape it**.

But before I start walking through my memories, I need to tell you guys how I ended up in this miserable state.

In short, I got into a fistfight with an angel.

And If you think I got all busted up, you should see the other guy!

As I mentioned in my last post, beings from the depths of Tartarus have been haunting me since my escape. Jailers of rotting flesh, insectoids with multiple faces that recount countless insults to my person.

With focus and meditation, I can ignore them during the day, endure them at night, and pray not to encounter them in my dreams. Although this last one always seems to happen, I usually manage to carry on with my life relatively well.

I just didn't knew that hell wasn't the only realm keeping an eye on me. With that in mind now, I should have noticed that something was wrong.

I have been having strange encounters.

A taxi driver who, instead of taking me to my apartment, guided me without me noticing to the nearest Catholic church and vanished with the car as quickly as he arrived.

A lady in the park who watched over me throughout the period I spent enjoying my late afternoon near the lake. I don't remember the color of her eyes, but something tells me she had more than one pair.

And the most recent one, a beggar who threw me against the wall as I exited through the back of the burger joint with my boss.

I couldn't see him arrive because he wasn't there initially; it's as if he had materialized from thin air in a matter of seconds.

I remember opening the door and heading towards the gutter, then an unbearable heat enveloped my body for a brief moment, and I was thrown against the wall.

At first, I also thought it was just a random bum trying to rob me, but the spectral glow in his eyes, the way reality slightly warped around his body, and his voice that echoed in my mind like the roar of a beast told me otherwise.

I... panicked.

You see, I am doing everything I can to avoid setting foot in Gehenna again. Until that attack, I clung to the comforting fact that I am out of that prison, that they can't hurt me anymore.

So when one of the soldiers from the celestial ranks pushed me against the wall, wrapping his heavy hands around my neck, a primordial fear crumbled my will. I could barely struggle as he roared in my mind.

"To dust thou returned, and cannot stay here. Thy soul, stained by the ashes of hell, is marked by the blood of the star. In thee, he sees a way out; in thee, the holy sees a mistake."

In his eyes, I could recognize pity and hatred.

He saw me as something so small and fragile, something to be protected from the claws of sin. One of the Creator's toys that had been so rudely broken and was now fighting against the rules that guide existence.

In his own words, a mistake.  
One that needed to be fixed.

Even with such a fragile appearance, his strength was tremendous. He squeezed my throat while whispering apologies in my mind. I could see demons approaching in the darkness, ready to grasp my soul in my final moments.

My heart racing, my mind almost devoid of oxygen, I could no longer think straight—I was going to die.

I stretched my arms against the wall, anything would do, any way to defend myself.

My hand closed around something cold and heavy, and with all my strength, I pulled.

Adrenaline is a powerful drug. I managed to wrench one of the rusty bars from the window and hit him with all I had.

The blow sent him into the street, where a van ran him over shortly after.

My boss insists that I had a panic attack and that in my altered state, I ended up throwing a loose iron rod at a school van, scaring some poor kid shitless, before fainting on the ground.

This brings me many questions.

Now more than ever, I feel paranoid, watched.

And knowing that people wouldn't even know if I were being attacked terrifies me.

I feel like my time is running out, something horrible is about to happen. So without further ado, I must fulfill my purpose and at least help you while we still walk in the same plane.

Hell is a place of torture and punishment, the reward our sins earn us in the afterlife, but it is also a prison.

It's not just for the sinners who wander the circles in search of a light that has long rejected them, but also for the original evil—the serpent that hisses hatred long before humanity even dreamed of existing.

The being forged when the Creator and the original angels still roamed the cosmos, shaping and expanding it.

He who was once God´s favorite, but has since fell with a third of the stars.

The one who commands faithful followers both on Earth and in the depths.

The concept of time in hell is complicated; some circles distort your perception, and two hours can suddenly become two minutes.

Combine this with the lack of natural light and claustrophobic confinements, and you will see that most of the slaves in the Silver City go through years like zombies, one day indistinguishable from the next, unaware if they have been there for a day or a decade.

In my fourth year as Jack's torture toy, this condition was affecting me aggressively.

Over the years, Jack had opened my schedule, allowing me to work under the orders of some of his followers in other regions of his kingdom, still confined behind the walls and never seeing the light of day.

My schedule was cruel and irregular, so much so that even today I must admit that I am not confident in stating that only four years have passed. In the morning, Astaroth would play with my mind; I lived a thousand lives with a thousand deaths, the profane void and the painful light of the vastness, my mind reduced to ashes and then expanded beyond the confines of my skull.

Immediately after, I was blindfolded and taken to the Pleasure zone, where I was forced to synthesize drugs and beverages from the blood of beasts and fungi.

In the floor directly below one of the main sales points of the Scarlet Maiden, the most purchased drug in the city, I worked for hours grinding and heating, accumulating terrible blisters and burns while my mind was numbed by the aroma and visions.

In a hot and cramped room, I was joined by five other slaves, and there we spent most of the day.

Deaths from overdose were common, some fell from excessive work, others were killed for pure pleasure. Our guards were always incredibly high and enjoyed mistreating us to maintain their sense of power.

Pawns so low in the hierarchy of the infernal king, probably venting years of spite in our daily sessions.

From time to time, the owner of the operation would come down to check the quality of the product, which was never refined enough, and would punish us for it.

By order of the king, he wouldn't lay a hand on me, but he made me watch and often forced me to participate in the torture of my colleagues. Fingers cut off, teeth pulled out, hot iron spikes on the backs of those who spilled even a gram of his precious product.

The things I was forced to do still keep me awake.

And always accompanying him, I saw her.

Unfortunately for Mice, the girl brought with me did not meet her end in his perverted arms, but in the hands of one of Jack's captains. Always with a distant look, drugged beyond her limit, following her master like an obedient dog.

Occasionally, she would watch me with a hint of sanity in her eyes.

While her master punished us. she often tried to approach me, but always without success.

When the work was done, I was put to sleep with gas and woke up again imprisoned in the palace catacombs, ready to endure another session of agony before sleep.

Day after day, this insanity continued, my long-diminished hope was exhausted, I became a shadow, a shell of my former self, ready to follow the next order, begging for mercy that was never granted.

This cycle continued until one particular night, when I woke up again below the castle, chained to the wall, with a decrepit old man beside me.

For some reason, Astaroth had let me rest that night; I should have suspescted something was wrong.

In the darkness, his face was hard to discern. I remember terrible dark circles, short and damaged gray hair. His eyes were sunken, pulling you in like ocean waves, his lips cut, and what seemed to be terrible gashes on his neck.

"So... it's true?" the old man murmured, breaking the silence.

"What are you talking about?"

"I've heard that madman's ravings many times, but this sounds different; there's some ground that supports the theory this time."

"I don't have time for the ramblings of a senile old man."

"Do you really have the Mark of the Beast?"

I stared into his eyes, recalling the same claim coming from my captor's mouth.

That fucking mark, up until then, I thought it was just an excuse that bastard Mice used to save his own neck, one that had cost me four years of confinement.

But there was a fearful weight in the old man's voice; his words carried a sense of truth.

"What is this damn mark? Ever since I set foot in this cursed city, I've been treated like merchandise, my mind scourged night after night because of this shit! You're all mistaken, you're wasting your time! Leave me alone!"

"Haven't you noticed anything strange, young man? We're just a bunch of damned souls in hell, but don't you feel that your stay has been particularly difficult? As if the very ground fights to keep you here?"

"I..."

"I've listened to the ramblings of the collector who found you; you were captured by an angel, weren't you? That doesn't usually happen. Something attracted it, just like the Succubus, just like the beasts."

"I'm just a wretched soul; there's nothing more to it. I'm only getting what I deserve! I should have been patient, Holly didn't deserve that, but she was going to tell everything! She was going to show the photos, and I was going to lose my job, my damn family, my house! I saw no other way! And now I'm paying for it, nothing more, nothing less..."

"Do you really think that's all there is to it? So many here with souls far more rotten than yours, yet still surrounded by pleasure and power. If hell worked as you think, why would Jack have what he has? Why would sinners be able to raise such a heresy as this metropolis?"

"I don't know, damn it! I just want all of this to end! I just want to go home!"

In the moments that followed, the old man pondered something in his mind, looking avidly into the darkness, fearing we were being watched, and then he said calmly, "I know a way out."

Despair is dangerous; the lack of a path, of a light, brings out the worst in humanity. Surrounded by eternal darkness, I was presented with a way out of torment, and it was as if a weight had been lifted from my shoulders.

"Don't say anything, just listen to me. If what I've heard about you is true, there is a chance. But I'll only tell you everything if you promise to take me with you. I'll withhold details as we travel to make sure you don't betray me. You'll do everything I say, how I say it, when I say it, or the deal is off."

"Wait, travel? To where?"

"The ninth circle of hell, of course, where the one who marked you is eagerly waiting. There, he holds a passage to a higher plane, where perhaps one can obtain a new body. "

A shock ran through my heart, a new body.

A way out of here.

"Even if all of this is true, how do you suppose we escape from here? It's not like Jack will suddenly repent of his sins and set us free overnight."

"That part I'll leave to you. Think of it as a test of your abilities. If you can get us out of here, it will serve as proof that you can handle the journey to the depths of the abyss. If we get caught, I'll know I was wrong about you."

We didn't talk for the rest of the night. I couldn't sleep either; how could I? My mind was restless with the possibility of salvation, an escape route from all the pain, a new chance at life. I just needed to get us out of there, but how? Trapped in the catacombs, without even the grace of seeing the city, I had no idea what things were like on the surface. I couldn't formulate a plan.

At least, not alone.

Patiently, I waited, the days passing by, torturous and merciless. But in that moment, I had gained a frightening resilience, with something to cling to, hope had flourished again, I thought not even the corrupted shadows of the city could shake me anymore.

Damn, was I wrong.

Finally, the day I had been waiting for arrived. You see, with so many slaves falling from excessive work and cruelty, an exchange would happen from time to time, and some familiar faces would appear when I was lucky.

On that day, when the blindfold was removed, I had to hold back from showing my happiness.

In the laboratory with me was John, tied to a wooden table in the corner grinding fungi with a leather mask, and in the middle, cracking open beasts' skulls with a giant hammer, was the gigantic man who had been captured with me.

A long day followed, the smell of sweat, blood, and drugs intensifying with each passing hour.

My eyes were keenly watching the movement of the guards, restless and anxious. It was almost a daily ritual, the moment they secretly entered the stockroom to 'evaluate the quality of the product.'

Precious few minutes when we were left alone.

As always, the guards grew tired of the trembling and tapping feet and retreated to the stockroom, threatening us with the loss of our eyes if we told anyone. As soon as the door closed, I got up and went directly to John.

As naturally as I could, I put on the leather mask and pretended to help him with the fungi while whispering by his side:

"I don't have time to explain, but I might be able to get us out of here, and I need your help to do it."

His calloused hands stopped working, dropping the equipment on the table.

"What?! Nate, is this true?"

"Don't turn to me, keep working."

Slowly, he returned to mashing the fungi and sorting them into small bags. He was trembling, making mistakes; hope in hell can easily shake anyone.

"What do you need?"

"Information, you work outside too, don't you?"

"Selling everything to the addicts who come from the lower city, but I don't know if I trust my life to anything that comes out of their mouths."

"That's something already. I need to know everything, even if it doesn't seem important. Please tell me, maybe we can-" — A heavy hand landed on my shoulder.

That behemoth of a person was standing right behind me.

He had heard everything.

Even with the constant cacophony of the equipment, the incessant blabbering from the upper store, and the lower tone of our voices, he had listened. He knew we were trying to escape.

"I want in."

"What?"

"A cripple and a pile of sticks? There's no way in hell you two are escaping this city without my help. If you want to do this, I'm coming along. If not, the guards will have a nice little surprise when they come back."

I could hear footsteps approaching. His expression made his intentions clear. I had no other choice at the moment but to include him in the team.

"Damn it, fine! Information, as much as you can get. When we meet here in the lab, we'll share everything we've discovered. Once we have a plan, we start taking action."

The door opened, and the soldiers entered, still with their masks down and their noses full of powder, seeing each of us quietly in our respective places.

In the following weeks, with the extra help, I was able to learn a lot about the flow of drugs and weapons in the city.

The Greek god of a man is named Yudi, and when he's not in the lab, he spends his days carrying metal plates to the lower city until his feet bleed.

With him, we discovered that about twice a month, the Collectors go out in droves through the gates toward Lust in search of fresh meat, taking with them an absurd amount of metal to supply the numerous outposts scattered throughout the circle.

John had discovered that a significant portion of the merchants in the Pleasure Zone use this expedition to transport a large part of their stock to the higher circles right under Jack's nose. On the night before the group's departure, the masters' most valued slaves are chosen to carry box after box to a certain warehouse in the lower city. There, the Collectors take their share of the deal and hide the goods in their cars before the day begins.

The collectors' parts are properly marked, and the rest is supposedly not opened.

In the darkness of the dungeon, my mind began to formulate a plan. If we could find a way to stay in the lab until the end of the shift, we might be able to infiltrate the merchandise and escape the Silver City through the front gate.

There were still many problems: the merchandise was moved at night, precisely when we were taken to our respective 'dormitories'. Our absence would surely be noticed. And how on earth were we supposed to even know which box would be moved to the warehouse and which would be sold the next day?

If we were to do that, we needed more information, but we also needed to be quick.

Up until that point since the old man's arrival, Astaroth and Jack had left me alone. If they decided to do another torture session, the Archduke of Hell would claim domain over my mind again and know exactly what I was planning to do.

I shivered, thinking about what horrors would await me after that.

Each night before bed, I updated the old man on the progress of my plan, asking for details on exactly how we would escape from that cursed plane when we reached the ninth circle. But that bastard never said anything, just looked at me waiting for my next move.

Afraid of losing the precious window that had opened for me, I foolishly decided that it would be better if we acted quickly and forced fate to smile upon us for a change.

When I woke up in the laboratory the next day, I took advantage of the guards busy fucking with their own minds to tell my colleagues the plan.

It was insane, but what in that pit of despair was coherent?

On rare occasions, the old man graced us with his presence in the laboratory; because of the agreement, he had to come along. I gave the excuse that he knew of a safe place where we could rest if we managed to escape. It wasn't convincing, but what other choice did they have but to accept?

When the four of us were working together, we would act. Thanks to John, I found out that we didn't always work the day shift in the laboratory; every other day, we spent entire nights in that damn cramped place.

If we caused a distraction, we could use the panic to invade the stockroom and hide among the merchandise that would be mislaid. The slaves would take us to the Warehouse, and from there, we would rely on luck for them to be too busy searching for us in the Upper City to find us.

We would have to leave before Jack was notified of our escape; with Astaroth by his side, there was no place in the city where we could hide.

Luckily, nobody wants to be the one to bring bad news to the psycho.

With the plan set, we began to act.

Having no idea the self-appointed King of Hell was already well aware of our actions.

The day I escaped from the Silver City was also the day I officially gave up my humanity while in hell.

Hatred, anger, they consume the heart of everyone, from the purest to the most honorable, not that I am anywhere close to being either of those things.

Even to this day, I still feel dirty, undeserving to be here now, and I know it all too well, but still, I do not regret the things I did to survive.

The plan had started well, with all of us together in the laboratory feeling anxious with every passing second, my stomach churning, my hands trembling. I didn't know how to act normally anymore, didn't want to raise suspicions, so I hyperfocused on my work, waiting for the end of the shift.

Cutting muscles from beasts, roasting ground fungus powder with a meat-like texture, slowly being numbed by the sweet aroma that always hung in the laboratory.

The sound of footsteps upstairs had considerably reduced, one of the signs that the shop was about to close, I looked at Yudi and nodded.

You know, the strange fungus that grows on the walls of the city has some interesting characteristics, they call it Dead Man's Fiber, to the touch it's like touching wrinkled skin, when ground and heated, a strange reaction causes it to become slimy and acidic, sticking to human muscle it devours it, generating a byproduct in the form of orange powder. The unrefined form of Scarlet Maiden.

In this state, the drug is highly unstable, and upon contact with water, it rapidly increases its temperature, which can give you horrible burns.

Or, if there's a sufficient amount, an explosion.

Throughout the day, little by little, we gathered five small bags filled with the byproduct, hiding them beneath the many empty bags scattered in the corner.

When I nodded, Yudi slowly rose and headed to the pile; the soldiers had once again left to get high, so he quickly planted the powder bags around the boiler, attracting curious glances from the poor souls accompanying us on that shift.

I hoisted John onto my back, the old man following closely behind, and we positioned ourselves at the edge of the stairs.

As soon as Yudi saw that we were ready, he lifted the water jug we received at the beginning of each day and threw it toward the boiler.

Then, chaos.

An explosion caused the floor directly above the boiler to collapse, powder and chemical gases making it nearly impossible to see more than a foot ahead, screams and cries of pain ensued.

One of the slaves who accompanied us was caught in the blast; an iron pipe from the boiler had pierced his neck, pinning him to the wall, the last customers of the shop above were caught in the flames that rose like a mushroom through the hole that opened in the floor.

Soldiers hurried down the stairs to control the fire, not seeing us pressed against the wall, we quietly went up as soon as everyone descended to control the damage.

John guided us to the stockroom; we had little time until the merchandise was moved to be saved from the flames.

I could already hear murmurs from outside; the distraction had worked, we had drawn attention.

Perhaps, too much of it.

In the darkness of the stockroom, it was hard to see anything; dozens of boxes filled the space, mostly unmarked. We had no idea which ones to break into.

"What now? Do we just pick at random? You told us you had a plan!" Yudi said, pulling at my shirt.

"Now is not the time for this!" John said somewhere in the dark. "Fuck, just...I don't know, pry open one of the smaller ones! There's supposed to be a way for the collectors to know which one to pick, maybe there's something inside!"

"Look at how many boxes there are! The fire is already spreading, it won't take long till-" Yudi was interrupted by a pound at the door.

"Open this fucking door already! I want my powder safe and sound, do you hear me! Useless bitch, hurry up!"

What little time we had was about to be over. I could faintly see scared eyes looking at me for answers in the darkness. My heart was pounding, and I just wanted to get out of there.

I noticed a pile of boxes that was more isolated than the others. Without light, it was hard to tell, but with no other choice, I hurried towards them.

The door was about to give in; we would have to rely on luck.

We opened two boxes, put on the leather masks in an attempt to avoid inhaling too much of the drug, and split up, hiding within the merchandise. I stayed with John, trusting that Yudi would take care of the old man.

The door gave in with a loud thud.

"Quick, you incompetents! I want every damn gram secured! And you, slut, get two more and get this shit out of here now! If Jack shows up, he's going to ask questions, and questions ruin an honest man's business."

The screams and footsteps, the smell of the drug making me dizzy, the smoke from the fire engulfing the shop. We were hurriedly moved to the elevator, and as I felt us descending, a wave of relief filled my heart.

Through the small cracks in the wood, I could distinguish the lower city slowly growing larger, the plan was working as intended.

I remember John smiling.

Maybe it was the drug, maybe it was the euphoria of the moment, but I remember being happy to have him with me.

...I miss him.

We were led to the warehouse, where they left the boxes and abandoned us in the darkness. I could hardly believe how well the plan was going.

Looking back now, I realize I was a fool.

The collectors never checked the boxes; they just loaded them onto the cars.

Before I could connect the dots, we were passing through the silver gates. Looking through the crack, I had once again the full view of that sin-ridden skeleton, and even as I moved away from it, I felt in my heart that I had already been touched by the city, and it tends to always reclaim what belongs to it.

The truck that was carrying us headed towards the Spire until the crown of the first circle was nothing more than a small dot on the horizon.

And then, it stopped.

"Why now? We haven't reached the spire yet, why stop now?" John whispered nervously in front of me.

Before I could respond, a chilling shiver ran down my spine upon hearing Mice's voice.

"Well, I think the little show has gone on long enough, hasn't it?"

The lid of our box opened, and I could hear the pumping sound of a shotgun. Above, Mice and two companions grinned maliciously at us.

"Well, well, what do we have here? Jack's new favorite little toy and his buddy! Care to tell me what you're doing in my shit?"

"Please, Mice, you can have the drugs, just let us go!" I pleaded.

Mice laughed, laughed so hard that his fucked-up lungs gave him a coughing fit. After composing himself, he ordered us to be taken out of the box. Yudi and the old man were already kneeling in the sand with their hands on their heads.

"Oh, fucking amazing! Hold on, let me get this straight. You really thought your dumbass idea would work out so well? Holy shit, buddy, you're really stupid, haha! Listen here, I'll tell you a little secret."

Mice approached my face, pressing the shotgun barrel against my chin.

"You would never have even found your little buddies again if Jack hadn't ordered it."

"What are you talking about?"

"Oh, come on! Use your fucking head! Everything so convenient, so perfect, your whole plan worked because Jack wanted it to. Your encounter with the old man, the information that reached your colleagues, the timings lining up, the guards leaving, all observed, all permitted."

My face contorted in horror; once again, I was nothing but a pawn, a toy of that maniac. Astaroth would always watch us, the king always controlling every miserable inch of his kingdom.

"Why!? Why would he let us get this far?"

"Something in your ultimate fate pleases him. If he can't extract any information from you, he'll just let you guide him to what he wants, won't he?"

"But then, why stop us now?"

Mice chuckled.

"Ding ding ding! This is the question of the moment! Congratulations, idiot, some neuron up there still works as it should! You see, I never cared about that mangy mutt. Jack is just a little baby who luckily gained a lot of power, if he's so afraid of what your mark represents like this, it means that you pose a danger to his empire, through you I'll have the chance to take the throne that has always belonged to me!"

Mice was interrupted by a sound, Yudi laughing as he watched kneeling.

With a smile, Mice approached, knelt in front of Yudi, carefully dusted the drug powder from his shoulders, and asked: "And what's so funny about that to you?"

"It's nothing, it's just that you call us idiots, but if you think you can usurp the throne with two piles of muscles and a tough attitude, you're even dumber than you seem to be."

The smell of gunpowder invaded my mind before I could process what had happened.

I remember touching my head, something was stuck in my hair, I lowered my hand and saw myself holding a loose tooth. "I heard a howl of fear, but why fear?

My ears were ringing, I couldn't think straight.

Yudi was lying back.

His skull sprawled across the sand, stained by a scarlet puddle.

"Oops, my bad, loose finger and all that."

"You motherfucker!" I lunged toward Mice, the barrel of his gun slowly turning towards me.

"No, no, no! I don't think so! If you lot wish to stay alive and not get a one-way ticket straight to Lust, where we already have some scouts ready to capture you, I must point out, you will behave!"

All that, just to become someone's toy again, I could hardly believe it.

Looking at Yudi's body, I wondered if he had felt any pain, the harder I made it for Mice, the better. Maybe if I were quick, I could escape the collectors in Lust.

But then, while I pondered, others acted.

The old man lunged at one of Mice's companions, biting his neck with all his might. The second one, startled, reached for his holster, but John quickly grabbed his legs, bringing him down to the ground.

They were willing to fight, to die for a chance.

Mice turned the gun towards them, pumping the shotgun once again. "Damn it, can't you do anything right? Stay still! I can't aim like this!"

I saw the opportunity and grabbed the shotgun.

A deadly tug-of-war ensued, punches and kicks thrown in an attempt to take control of the weapon, the power to kill. I was malnourished, still weak, tired, and slightly high. Mice was an experienced Collector, a bloodthirsty killer who had faced demons head-on. It was only a matter of time before he overpowered me.

I gave up pulling the shotgun towards me and pushed it with all the weight of my body towards Mice. We fell and rolled in the dry sand, the gun stopping a few feet ahead.

I crawled to the shotgun, Mice holding onto my feet and pulling me into another exchange of punches.

I don't know what came over me, all the anguish, all the fury and fear accumulated until that moment exploded into rage. I gave up on the gun and threw myself at Mice, landing repeated punches to his head.

Again, adrenaline is a powerful drug.

Screaming, without full control of my arms, I punched, I punched until Mice's face was nothing but a red mess, until his arms stopped retaliating, until his chest stopped breathing. I continued until tears filled my eyes and sobs choked my throat.

I looked at my hands, and the weight of what I had done became clear in my mind.

Killing a person changes you; you can feel life slipping away from their eyes. Even in that place, where death is just the beginning of another cycle of pain, it still holds its weight.

The old man's screams of pain snapped me out of my trance. His efforts were admirable, but he was eventually thrown to the ground, where the Collector attempted to strangle him. I grabbed the shotgun, and out of pure instinct, I struck the Collector's head with all my strength. He immediately fell onto the old man, the base of the gun now adorned with a red stain.

Looking to the side, John was trying to wrest the gun from the Collector, without success. In the distance, I could see dust rising; we weren't alone. The king had noticed that something was amiss.

The old man took the gun from my hands and opened a hole in the Collector's chest, who collapsed like a house of cards onto the dry ground.

The spire was visible; we needed to go. With John in my arms, I ran.

"Leave him behind! He'll do nothing but slow us down!"

I could feel John's embrace tighten. He knew he was a burden; he knew what they would do to him if we left him behind. I could feel his fear.

Ignoring the protests, I headed towards the spire.

They were getting closer; I could discern the caravan amidst the cloud of dust.

Upon reaching the spire, Aecus's judgmental gaze bore down on us coldly. Remembering Mice's words, I approached.

"Oh Aeacus! King of Aegina, my heart is not pure for rest, my eyes are blind to injustice, and my fists only weigh for my desires. From dust I came and to dust I return, my soul judged to forever burn, so I beg you to open the doors to my torment."

His cold gaze remained unmoved; the Spire would not heed my words.

"This won't work. We need to go to the lower circles. It would be incredible if we could get Rhadamanthus's attention, but at the top of Hell, it's hard for him to hear us."

"What do we do now? I've done my part; I got us out of the city. Do yours and take us to the Ninth Circle!"

The old man looked at me, his eyes burning with fury; for a moment, it seemed like there was a dark gleam in his eyes. He calmed himself and approached the entrance.

The followers of the morning star follow his teachings in exchange for secrets and powers greater than a mere sinner could ever dream of. How to survive in such a ruthless terrain, how to tame and enchant demons and spirits, how to change oneself.

The old man whispered words in a convoluted language forgotten by time. Aecus began to chant in response, and the spire trembled in anticipation, the chamber taking on a sinister glow.

Without looking back, the old man said, "A wish for a wish, a will for a gift, Blood taken in exchange for bliss"

"What the fuck *are* you?" I asked.

"Nathanael, you have a choice to make. Do you want to escape Hell? Do you want your life back?"

"Of course!"

"Then John must die."

A chill ran down my spine. Nothing comes easy in the abyss. Only pain, only suffering.

John begged for mercy, and in my mind, I knew what I had to do, the price Minos demanded for his services. The old man merely watched me.

John fought, struggled until the last second.

He threw himself off my back and crawled through the sand towards the caravan, which was slowly approaching.

"I'm sorry, John."

I dragged him by the stumps of his legs into the depths of the spire. He tried to cling to the ground, breaking his nails in the process. I threw him against the inner wall, and in that moment, both of us could feel it.

The Spire would claim him.

There would be no turning back; death would be eternal. Nothingness would embrace him.

I had to ensure he wouldn't escape.

With tears in my eyes, I broke his arms, his screams still haunt me. Even to this day, I suffer from it; every morning, I hear his whispers, every night, his screams keep me awake.

I did what I had to do to survive.

I wished there was another option. I wished so much that John was still by my side, but Hell was devised in such a way that even something as simple as friendship is only allowed for punishment.

I tried to be quick. With one of the rocks from outside, I broke his knees, turned around, and left.

"Nate, please! Please, Nate, don't do this to me! You bastard, what did I ever do to you? I hope you suffer, you piece of shit! Burn a thousand times in the deepest pit of this place!"

When I left, a black mass flooded the chamber, and I could see as Nate was consumed by the Spire. Until the moment they were dissolved, his eyes never stopped looking at me in that way, with palpable hatred.

At that moment, I realized that everything I had suffered until then was justified, I belong in Hell.

I tried to warn; I am not a good person.

The mass took on a purple glow, and the old man quickly pulled me inside. The last thing I saw before disappearing was the red glow of Jack's ring approaching in the caravan.

The air in Heresy is putrid, a constant miasma floats in the air like snowflakes, slowly filling your lungs and eventually killing you.

Outside the Spire in the center of the 6th circle, I noticed for the first time a strange mark on the back of my left hand.

A delta adorned with thorns.

But at that moment, I couldn't focus on it; all I could do was cry, huddled near the Spire, wondering if it was all really worth it.

"Let's go, he doesn't like to wait."

"Who?"

He looked at me, with a somber look in his eyes.

"Samael, the Morning Star, the true Lord of Hell."

These memories pain me, my hands tremble, and my eyes filled with water make it difficult to write.

I also still haven't fully recovered from the beating I took from that angelic being, so for today, we'll stop here.

Hell is an eternal prison, where everything and everyone are made and placed in such a way that at any moment they can be used against you.

Only pain will bring you a semblance of security, only agony will bring you power.

In this insane realm of trades, I should have realized that even the way out would exact a terrible price.
