Sitting at his desk, Michael stared alternatively between his computer screen and mug of coffee. Despite the fact they were right next to each other, the sharp edges of his view allowed him only to see one or the other. Without a doubt, it was getting worse. he booked another doctors appointment, although knowing that they would keep saying the same thing, You probably need more sleep, other than that, there is nothing unusual we can discern about your eyesight, but this time, something was definitely not right. To change his mind, he started to work on his clients illustration, but as he realised how difficult drawing would eventually become, a sudden fear overshadowed his ability to think creatively. To what extent was his peripheral vision going to shrink?

Several days past, they were unbearably slow, each one starting off with the feeling that his view was becoming increasingly restricted, to a point where it started to affect his spacial awareness. He would have to endlessly pivot his head round and round in order to fully grasp the dimensions of his apartment. Unfortunately, this was the day of his doctors appointment, and the thought of adventuring himself out into the city seemed impossible. He phoned his good friend Aaron, who was always more than willing to help. Upon hearing the news, Aaron seemed devastated to here what had happened, and without hesitating offered to take him to his doctors appointment. The intercom aggressively buzzed, Michael unlocked the door and Aaron’s footsteps could be heard as he paced up to the apartment. It was good to see even just half of a friendly face. Aaron took Michael by the arm and guided him out of the apartment, locked the door for him, made sure that he didn’t trip while walking down the stairs, and helped him get in the car without banging his head. They set off.

As Michael looked out of the window, making the most of what was left of his eyesight, he expressed his scepticism in it’s rehabilitation. But Aaron, being the positive mind that he always was told him not to worry, and that everything would be back to normal after the visit. Although Michael strongly believed in his friends words, they made no difference, powerless against those used by the doctor.

“Michael, your eyesight is perfect, I have looked now, and many times before, and there is no difference, you need to stop creating problems for yourself, and for me. I can’t treat what I can’t see, now if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to attend.”

After such a defeat, They headed back to the car. Micheal was devastated, and Aaron, well…He couldn’t tell what Aaron was thinking, because he never turned around, and even if he did, his expression would be fragmented, impossible to seize the whole picture in one go. On the journey back, Aaron was very quiet, maybe he regretted what he said earlier, sincerely hoping that the doctor would have a cure. When they got back, he apologetically helped Michael out of the car, and up the dimly lit stairs. About halfway up, the light went out.

“That’s strange, where’s the switch?”

“It’s back down at the bottom of the stairs”

“Haha, that’s not very helpful for you is it”, Aaron seemed to be taking this too lightly, it wasn’t funny, “I’m sorry, you stay here, and I’ll sort it out”.

As Aaron casually walked back downstairs, Michael had to hold on to the banisters, he felt dizzy from his inability to perceive the space around him.

“I think the bulb is gone, but don’t worry, I’ll come by later and fix it”.

They slowly made their way to the top of the stairs, and proceeded to enter the apartment, but they couldn’t.

“Aaron, where’s the key?”

“Ah You’re right, I had the key last”

“Where is it?”

“It’s probably still in my car, I’ll go and get it, you stay there”.

He went back down the stairs to his car, or did he? It was unclear to Michael at that point, because Aaron did take a ridiculous amount of time, maybe he lost the key, then what would he do? He tried to ignore these thoughts and decided to sit down against the cold stone wall. the darkness of the hallway combined with his obstructed view, meant he could see very little. He could just about make out the grainy patterns on the wall, the alignement of the tiles on the floor, and the dark wooden ceiling…he couldn’t see, it looked like a night sky, a night sky without star, pitch black, nothing, no sign of life, he was alone.

He also noticed the edge leading to the stairs at the end of the hallway, he didn’t pay much attention to it until now, he could feel a kind of rising tension. If something that wasn’t Aaron were to suddenly appear behind that edge…He preferred not to think about it, but it was too late, the idea had nested itself into his mind, and he couldn’t stop eyeing the end of the hallway, he could feel each second passing by hitting like an adrenaline fuelled heartbeat, 1 second was 5 seconds and 5 seconds was a minute. His mind translated every sound around him into unwanted footsteps, the slamming of a car door, the sound of water running through pipes above him, the opening of a door, the closing of that same door, the door of this apartment block, the sound of actual footsteps, footsteps ascending the stairs of this very block, the stairs that lead to the edge of the hallway.

He closed what was left of his eyes, but he could still hear, plugged his ears, but he could still feel, and there was nothing he could do about that. The fear wasn’t coming from the feeling of being approached by some ghostly figure, but from the thought that he could no longer trust the stability of his view, what if the shrinking peripheral vision didn’t stop there, what if his mind started playing tricks on his own self, his eyesight displaying things that weren’t even there, hallucinations. The footsteps slowly grew louder, and louder, then stopped, seemingly right in front of him. A confused Aaron looked down at his quaking friend, eyes shut, arms rapped around himself as if attempting to turn himself inside out.

“Are you OK?”

Michael slowly looked up recognising the voice,

“Yes, I’m fine…I fell and hit my head…the back of my head…and my arm”

“Can I have a look”

“No it’s fine, you probably won’t see anything”

“I found the key”

He held it up, But before he could even see it, Michael had to locate where the arm it was attached to was, and before he got a chance to do so, Aaron had already turned around, and produced a reassuring clicking sound. Well, he must of had it, otherwise how could he have opened the door. Upon entering, Michael felt lost, there was no longer a sense of home in his apartment. There didn’t seem to be a sense of home anywhere in fact. It all seemed unstable, on the edge of falling apart.

“What am I going to do now?” Said Michael, semi-asking himself.

“Well there is such a thing as blindness, lots of people live with it”

“I’m not blind though”

“You might as well be”

“How could you say that! What’s wrong with you today? I’m not blind, I can still see, and what ever eyesight I have left, I will not give up on, Why are you not taking this seriously?”

“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that”.

His apology was strangely half hearted, he stopped looking at Michael and wondered over to the cupboard, shocked as he opened it.

“Is this all you have to eat?”

“I think there’s a few cans of…”

“There’s nothing in here!”

“I’m sure there is at least a can of…”

“This is terrible, You stay here, while l go to the shops, I’ll bring back a big stock of food and change the lightbulb”

“Aaron, that’s so kind of you, I’m sorry I yelled at you”

“No don’t be, it was stupid of me, anyway friends are bound to have arguments now and then, back in no time”.

On these words, Aaron left, although Michael didn’t see him leave, he assumed so by hearing the door close. He felt relieved even though something suddenly started to bother him. There definitely was a can of beans in the cupboard, if it was there this morning, it would definitely be there now. But like Aaron said, it was no where to be found. He wouldn’t have thought anything of it, except there was something else, his keys were gone again, did Aaron really forget to give him the keys back a second time. He lay down for a nap, hoping to dissipate this newly growing paranoia. He awoke with a jolt, it was Aaron knocking at the door. He came in, his hands wrapped around an over-stuffed bag.

“I changed the bulb, the light works again”.

He placed the seemingly heavy bag on the table, and breathed heavily.

“I can’t tell you how much you’ve helped me, this must be enough food for a month, what did you get?”.

Having said this, Michael made his way to the table, and upon locating the bag, he opened it. “Flour?…More flour?…Aaron how many bags of flour did you get?…Look there’s more of it! Is that all you bought? You did, that’s all there is…flour!”

“Yes…I’m really sorry, I don’t know what happened, I guess I was distracted, or maybe I picked up someone else’s bag by mistake, anything could have happened”

“Aaron…First of all, how focused do you need to be in order to not feel drawn to buying nothing but flour, and second of all, why would anyone else do that?”

“…I’ll go back to the shops”.

As Aaron left, Michael lay back down, and tried to get some more sleep. He couldn’t, although Aaron was a friend, he was beginning to feel that he was becoming as useless as his eyesight, as if both were interconnected in some way. The key was still missing, he forgot to reclaim it, but kept getting distracted by Aaron’s weird behaviour. Then, the phone rang, Aaron was on the other end.

“Hi, it’s Aaron, look I’m sorry, I’ve got so much to do, I won’t be able to make it to the shops today”

“Aaron, I’m going to be surviving on flour”

“I think surviving is a bit exaggerated, anyway I’ll be back first thing tomorrow with food”

“I would have gone out myself to find something to eat, but you still have the key to my apartment”

“You’re right, I do have it, you’ll have it back tomorrow”

“Well, can’t you just bring it round now”

“I’m sorry I’m so busy, anyway, nothing is stopping you from going out”

“I can’t leave with my door unlocked, also what if I lose my sense of direction”

“I’m sure you’ll be fine, in the meantime, There are plenty of things you can do with flour and water”

“Glue?”

“if you mix some flour with a bit of water, you’ll get a dough, you can then flatten it, cut it into squares and bake it, apparently that’s what they did during the war, there was so little moisture in it that it could last for months”

“Aaron, this isn’t funny”

“I’m only trying to help, if I hadn’t brought round that flour, you would have nothing to eat”

“Well thanks a lot then, I probably ought to get off the phone and start making some cement before I lose my patience”

“No problem, I’ll be back tomorrow”.

They hung up simultaneously. Aaron did have a tendency to be facetious, but this was taking it to a whole new level. He wasn’t usually this careless, it didn’t feel like carelessness though, more like some kind of sick practical joke, was that Aaron’s style? Michael realised he had trouble remembering how he met Aaron. It was at university, in fact they shared a flat, no they didn’t, they met at the graduation party, he was standing in the corner looking lonely, no that was someone else, in fact it wasn’t in university, was he a coworker? Someone he bumped into? As Michael sunk deeper into this endless maze of memories, he became lost, and with each dead end, he grew increasingly fearful.

It was late, Michael wanted to sleep but couldn’t, all of these new thoughts blocking his ability to do so. How to get the doctors to help him, how to earn money, now that the line of work he’d opted for was now unadapted for him, and how to survive if he couldn’t go out, Aaron, although seeming to be the answer at first, was turning into another problem. He thought about contacting other friends, but realised that he never stayed in touch with any of them, at least that’s what he thought upon seeing nothing but Aaron’s number on his phone, where were his other contacts? He was no longer in the mood for sleeping, there was no point. Before he could reach the computer, he almost tripped while searching for the light switch. Once he located the desk, focusing on the computer screen caused him to crash into the chair.

Lying on the ground, he could feel a dented bruise start to form on the front of his leg. He stayed there for a while, as if there was no reason to continue because he was beaten by a chair. He hesitantly got up again, placed the chair back on its four legs, and sat down, dizzy from his head restlessly pivoting in order to seize the whole picture of his surroundings. His peripheral vision was allowing him to see about six keys at a time, or he would have to stand at the other end of the room to be able to see the keyboard in its entirety. It was all such an adventure, that for a moment, he forgot why he got up in the first place. The strong hope of finding someone he knew, even a distant acquaintance he had once sent a message to, was crushed. There was no one, his inbox was empty, not a single email. Apparently he had never spoken to anyone since he was born, and the client he was doing the illustration for never existed in the first place. Even after endless searching for people online, he realised he was alone, as if the whole world had vanished, everyone except him and Aaron.

The endless scrolling was like counting sheep, his fragmented view was going blurry while his muscles, once stiff, were slowly giving up, several times he could feel his head falling back. While his determination fought back at its best, eventually it collapsed along with the rest of his body. There was a knock, silence, then a series of knocks with long pauses between each, resonating like the pounding of a massive rusty iron door leading to a place only few would know about. Instead of questioning why someone was knocking at his door at 4 in the morning, Michael, in a hazy state, decided to let them in. That was until he realised that he didn’t have the key, was he still locked in? Apparently not, as he moved his head towards the door to find that it was wide open, leading to the dark hallway. Someone was there with him.

“Hello, is anyone there?”

There was no answer, his eyes were anxiously darting around the room, each time, not quite grasping what he was seeing, the the light blue was obviously the wall, the wood pattern could have been the floor board, the leg of his bed or the cupboard, it turned out to be the door. Frustrated, he started to spin on his chair, attempting in a split second to piece together the puzzle that was his apartment. He couldn’t see anyone.

“Get out of my apartment! I’m warning you!”

he shouted, attempting to cover up from himself the fact that he was terrified. There was a constant sound that was getting closer to him, a sound that, if you were to play it backwards, you would hear heavy breathing. He swivelled round on his chair, wanting to reverse the roles, and caught a glimpse of half a face, partially covered by the shadows, wrinkled, cracked and melting, an empty eye socket staring back at him, fitting perfectly within the sharp circle of his view. The shock released, like springs, hundreds of acidic shivers that slowly trickled down his spine. He felt like he was falling backwards, but instead of hitting the edge of the desk, he was floating, and while slowly spinning, he would keep meeting with the face, each time at a different distance or angle and increasingly deformed and horrific.

Michael awoke suddenly, cold sweat dripping from his forehead, on the verge of falling off the chair. He stood up realising that it was nearly 2 PM, mystified as to where all of that time had gone. Aaron was supposed to be here in the morning with food and his keys. He headed to the hallway to see if by any chance if he was there, but the situation was worse than he thought as the door wouldn’t open, Aaron had locked him in. His inability to focus for more than a minute, due to the fact that he hadn’t eaten anything for two days, led him to mix some flour with water and a bit of salt that was hanging around in the cupboard, then bake it. It wouldn’t be much, but something desperately needed to occupy his mind. He spent the afternoon nibbling away at the salty rock hard confections, tasting like freshly sun dried sand, looking out of the window, onto unusually empty streets, and hoping to find another contact other than Aaron’s.

He tried every number stored in his brain over the years, but none answered, not even the police. The only thing left to do was to sit back on the couch and wait for Aaron to come, at this point, not knowing what to expect. Aaron wasn’t going to bring him his keys, or food, he probably wasn’t even going to show up. Micheal shouted, hoping to grab the attention of a now distant other, but deep down, he knew that he was alone, his apartment floating in some infinite abyss, along with his view that was always more and more restricted, yet never in it’s entirety for some reason. He lay back and waited for the darkness to slowly consume him. He heard knocking at his door, the knock’s unfamiliar spacing made him jump.

What seemed irrational started to twist itself into plausible, until he could no longer shake the idea of his nightmare becoming real out of his head. he kept his eyes on the door, anticipating the moment the wooden pea sized circle would suddenly turn black. On the other side, he could hear the almost teasing jingle of a bunch of keys. It didn’t take him long to realise that they were his bunch, recognising immediately their familiar sound pattern, and more so when he heard one of them being inserted in the keyhole of his own apartment. The obvious suddenly came to him, there was only bunch of keys, and he didn’t have them.

“Aaron, is that you?”

There was no answer. Michael could feel his nightmare suddenly resurfacing, got up and ran to the door before the key could arrive back at it’s starting position. As he ran, he kept getting tripped up, his own apartment betraying him, the door seemed impossible to attain. He was at arms reach of the handle, when the door suddenly opened. Sensing the horror that was about to be standing before him, Michael fell to the ground. The floor shielding his eyesight, he lay there anticipating the worst.
