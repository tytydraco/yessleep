Yup you read that title right, I'm a legal registered demon hunter. Most people think demons are all some paranormal bullshit and just straight instances of possession of the human soul, ya know some real exorcist conjuring movie type stuff. But actually our own government is using it as a blanket term for all the ghoulies, mummies, werewolves, and the things that bump at night. Let me get this outta the way early if there was god he wouldn't have made half the shit i’ve seen, can be damn sure on that. You ever heard of the Grunch, little feisty ugly motherfucker she is, also smells like a rotting corpse layered in a pedal of onions. Who would create that abomination to terrorize hardworking farmers huh. Now I have been in this profession for almost thirteen whole years and I still can’t believe I’ve lasted this long. What I mean by that is by my own fucking hand, this job is gritty as hell but really takes a toll on yourself. I'm a greedy dog just listening to the orders sent by higher ups. Takes a toll on myself, most creatures from the depths of hell I have come across aren't what they made up to be. They are just tryna survive and see another day like the rest of us. Most of the exterminations I do aren't justified. These beings are living creatures that deserve just as much right to live as anything on this planet. I kill a lot or capture a lot of docile “demons” that don’t mean harm. But my greedy self keeps blind eye for that green that the good old government gives me. When I began my work I justified it as helping humankind and knowing most of the creatures I have encountered would be a danger to the good old American dream. But I knew all along they wanted to experiment or use these creatures for whatever fucked up science project they had.

 Didn't bother me at first, I loved the money too much. But it started itching at me over years like a ticking clock. Sure I have encountered some disgust that would hunt humans for sport but most of them just want to live out the years secluded. But enough of my little rant of self pity and regret just wanted to let y'all know these demons are not all the glorified boogeyman they have been made out to be. Now let me tell you about one of my first jobs I took. Young cocky as hell and ruthless as all get back ready to pull the trigger on a demon in a moment's notice. Got the text from the unknown number with the coordinates to pick up the file for my next job. I arrive at an abandoned hotel and go to room number 19 swing door open, dust flying everywhere with the nice neat file folder laying on the cockroach infested bed. I open up the file and skim through it. The location is at a small little beach town in north Florida. Target's name is called the Abyss, 9 foot tall on the dot, 450 pounds, covered in pitch black long hair and fitted with a nice pair of bright red eyes. Also listed with it was razor sharp teeth and a pair of five inch claws to make the ultimate killing machine. Basically the gist of it was lotta dead deer popping up everywhere and a couple of sightings by the locals. All the deer were found with a nice clean slit of their throats. The men in black swiftly came to diffuse any crazy talks between neighbors, gaslighting them to believe it is a rapid oversize black bear. Yeah the men in black with there almost perfect clean suits exist and they are fucking dicks.

 I was tasked with eliminating the target and sounded like I was in for a lot. I arrived a little shortly after and did a little recon which suggested finding the closest bar. They had this little place called Sundown, a little tiki hut, the best margaritas on the beachside I have ever had. I didn’t have too much to go off but I knew its killings of the wildlife were near the locals so that's where I would start. Let me tell you the government sure knows how to give me the best gear a man could dream of. I had high tech night vision goggles that could track the signatures of footprints and a fully geared out AR-15 equipped with a suppressor to reduce the muzzle flash. Also my lucky 1911 always took with me, my dad gave it to me as a present when I was a boy. I had one stim called Keo made from the best of best the government could get, basically if I sustain a serious injury like a broken leg or a huge open wound, one stick of this I’m brand new In just a couple seconds also shortly grants some superhuman like strength. It’s crazy what the motherfuckers can make now. I also picked up some special bear-like traps that would snap any normal human being's leg right in half. 

Once nightfall hit I started setting up the traps in the woods right across from the two households that saw the Abyss last time. A lot of woods and a huge state park right next to this beach town called Tate's Hell, got a nice ring to it. I did a little research into this place and found a story about the local fishermen seeing sightings of what they called a skunk ape. No mistake had to be the same damn thing. I was posted about half a mile from the house's had my night vision goggles on and listened to some Fergie waiting patiently pondering if the Abyss would make an appearance near here again. I know Fergie right, her catalog is pretty good especially when she joined the Black Eyed Peas. Couple hours go by with nothing seen and I'm running out of Jack Daniel shooters so I'm getting a little pissed off. Then around three o'clock at night I see the thing appear on the other side of the woods near the houses. His name sure did live up to his reputation of almost complete darkness except for those beady red eyes that left a glare in the night sky. He had a dark green vest to accompany small pouches everywhere. I wondered where he obtained such a huge vest and why he was wearing it, I mean it kinda stood out with his whole pitch black fur. But I left him a little present on the edge of the woods, not in plain view. Three deers with their necks slit from ear to ear. Saw him approaching where I left them at.

 So now I know the fucker has a keen sense of smell. I move in closer to position, wondering if my present will piss him off knowing he's got a little competition here. I get right by the houses facing the woods not a single peep from the wildlife complete dead silence. I see the Abyss overwhelming dread hit me as I see him make his soft small steps inching towards the deer. He was quite reluctant to approach them and took a while staring at them, maybe admiring the work displayed in front of him. I feel sweat dripping down my face as I slowly pull out my assault rifle careful to not make any noise. He finally steps into the woods and seconds later one of the bodies of deer comes flying into the road, no head attached. The Abyss lets loose a deathing screech of pure anger and bloodlust. My headphones blasting meet me halfway by the Black Eyed Peas break imminently. Surprisingly the glass of the houses did not shatter. Of Course that woke up the sleeping families in the house. I could see the lights flicker on and heard a couple of shreeks of terror from the sound they just heard. He then swiftly comes back out, eyeing the first house with intent to destroy and conqueror. I assume he was fast and sure enough knew he was deadly. I aimed in on the target, took a deep breath and knew my first priority was getting this thing far away from the innocent families. I only had a few seconds to react, I shouted in my brain, “just focus, you are better than him” over and over. I pulled the trigger unloading the full clip and began moving in on him. He tried to shield the bullets with his oversize arm but quickly became overwhelmed and ran off into the woods. I quickly throw the gun over my shoulder and go into hot pursuit after him. 

As I make it into the woods I overhear the terror and confusion of the neighbors and know the cops will be over there soon enough. I followed his footprints big enough they were easy to track. My plan was going accordingly, he took the bait, and I forced him into the woods where all my traps were dumped everywhere. As I track each footprint with moonlight gleaming over me I know I can’t possibly keep up with the Abyss he has to hit one of my traps. I keep tracking the footprints for thirty minutes in almost a full sprint the whole time. I slow down, I pull out my flask and get a nice refreshing drink of gods nectar whisky. As I slowly began to keep walking this thing hasn't hit a single trap. I mean I set out a decent amount and then I felt it in my heart I lost the damn thing. Wouldn't look good on my early resume and I would be losing out on a big paycheck. Now I’m in the middle of Tate’s Hell with a destructive force of nature that is pissed off at me. If I remember right Tate’s hell gots its name from a guy who got lost in those woods for about seven days and once he made it to the edge he fainted and died on the spot. Started to wonder if I would be dealt the same fate as poor Tate. But I kept following the tracks too determined to let this money go. Then I reach a bit of open spaced area and the tracks have disappeared literally vanishing, nothing in sight. I then pull out the night vision goggles and proceed to scan the area. 

Nothing, not even a trace, I then slowly look up and see a heat signature footprint on the tree in front of me. It keeps going up and I dread the idea of looking up even further. I drop the goggles in the dirt, I pull out my 1911 and stare directly above me and sure enough those god damn red beady eyes looking into my soul. My stomach twisted upside down and I felt the whisky about to come right back up. I didn’t shoot, I held the gun in a firm grip locked in on the target. I was frozen in fear for about ten seconds which felt like an eternity still having my lucky firearm locked in on him. In a flash he dropped down landing on his enormous bulky feet. I stepped back feeling the adrenaline starting to kick in. Then the Abyss spoke in a dark condescending tone, “What do you want from me human”. If I haven't pissed myself yet that surely did it for me, the god damn the speaks. I have never heard a target speak up until now. I didn't mutter a peep, completely starstruck at this oversize behemoth pacing back and forth slashing his claws together. He stops in his tracks and stares at me. I notice my bullets manage to damage his hide with dark purple blood like substance oozing out of him, thank god for the government for giving me some real deal monster killing bullets. He proceeds to state, “I do not hunt your kind so what is your business with me, I honestly pity yall disgusting creatures always fighting with one another”. I silently nod in just pure amazement. I mean this thing speaks but also fluent english so many questions arise in my head. 

The Abyss inches closer to me, daunting his shiny almost metal like teeth. He then says in a demanding voice, “I want to be left alone from your kind, if this is about the deer I slay it is purely for entertainment for my lonely self”. I twist my head to the right and whisper, “What the fuck are you suppose to be”. He proudly puffs his chest out and begins to laugh his ass off. He then settles down and looks me square in the face and said, “I will be the end of your wretched life if you don’t leave me be you insect”. That hit a chord in me right there and I switched my demeanor quickly. I gave the Abyss a cocky smirk and let off three shots right at his red eyes. He covered his face quickly. I then threw my assault rifle off my body and slid right through his legs pulling out my two knives from my back pockets and impaled both his feet. He let out a shriek and I quickly got up and opened fire on his back. He turned around and rushed into me, throwing me into a tree. I looked up and saw one of my eyes completely shut with the same substance oozing out. He then proudly said, “I’m impressed by you, quick on your feet but you will pay with your life for such foolishness”. I stand up and take off running to the right of him. He opens up his pouches and pulls out eight knives twice the size of his claws and begins throwing them at me with precision. I evaded most of them by ducking for cover behind the trees but one slipped through and striked me right in the thigh. I bit my lip and pulled it out, blood gushing everywhere. I slip the knife into my back pouch. My adrenaline surly kicked in and I was in complete survival mode and took off trying to get back to my assault rifle.

 I was using my 1911 to suppress fire on him to distract him enough until I could reach my rifle. I finally got around to picking up my rifle and picked it up and in an instant the Abyss slashed my chest open with one swift attack. I fly back a couple feet and can hear him croaking in full enjoyment of my death. I injected Keo into my open chest wound without a second thought. Still on the ground I pick up my rifle and unload the bullets into the beast. After ten seconds all my wounds were healed up. I backed up still shooting at him. He was tanking all the bullets but at a cost it was starting to wear him down. I rushed at him still unloading bullets directed at his face. He covered his face as I made the same move through his legs but using all my strength to pull out the knives in his feet. I began to furiously slash at his legs with everything I had. He then fell to his knees and I began to lunge the knives into his back climbing all the way to his head. He threw both of his hands behind himself. I managed to dodge the first claw fist hand but the second impaled my lower half. At that point I pulled out his signature knife and slit his throat in quick swift motion. He dropped like a bag of potatoes to the ground. I pull out his claws not feeling any of the pain. Covered in blood of my own and the Abyss. I stand over him and take in the glory of his defeat by a mere insect. I pull out my phone and dial the emergency line for a scenario like this and I then collapse in utter victory.

 I woke up in a special government institution laying in a bed iv hooked up to me everywhere but my wound was all gone. Man walks in toting cargo shorts with a pink flower button up shirt. He then looks at me and says “You looked like shit when we picked you up, but good job your payment will be wired to you shortly, till next time Jack”. There were so many questions from that night that still linger in my head now and again. That was the first time I found out that demons can be as intelligent as us humans. I have seen and encountered many strange beings in my time, but this day is when I started to really question if what I was doing was right.
