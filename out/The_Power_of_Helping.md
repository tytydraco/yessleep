Well, maybe first I should introduce myself to you. Or better said...don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't want to do that right now. I don't feel comfortable enough for that. You know, nowadays you have to be careful before meeting people, you never know who might be the next Norman Bates to cross your path, right?

Well, my story is simple to tell. I help people. Yes, just that. Whenever there is a family dispute, a gambling debt issue or a fight between neighbors, I help. By God, I once helped someone who was simply tired of her boyfriend. And it was one of the easiest help I've ever done. But don't think that this gives me pleasure. It's common. Serious. It's not exciting, it's not boring, it's not even invigorating. It is extraordinarily common. And, as you may know, there is no boredom in something ordinary. Boredom is an invention to keep us distracted. But I digress. I will return to my story.

I started helping people when I was around 25 years old. I was dating a girl at the time, Jéssica, who was very pretty and friendly. She had a possessive ex who did not accept the end of the relationship. I had discussed it with him many times on the phone, but nothing more than that. However, one day he went further. He tried to set up an ambush for Jessica and I while we were walking home after going to the movies. He was hiding in an alley near the building where we lived and jumped on us as soon as we passed by. I was scared, but as soon as I recognized him, I grabbed him by the shirt and shouted:

*What do you want, you idiot?*

And he replied:

*I just want to understand why*

*Wait, I'll help you understand....*

And before I could raise my arm to punch him, the man collapsed to the ground. Like a wax doll. Jessica looked at me without understanding and asked what had happened. I had no idea what had just happened. She bent down and found that he had no pulse. I stared at my hands for a minute and couldn't come up with anything close to a justification for what had happened in those moments. In the meantime, Jéssica had called emergency services. We agreed to say that the ex had tried to attack us, he started feeling sick and fell dead in front of us. It was the best we could think of.

Well, I'll spare you everything that happened after that, but yes, the police were suspicious, but given the aggressive history of Jessica's ex-boyfriend, there weren't many more questions for her or me. It was another case of sudden illness, it happens, end of story. What really matters is my “power”. Yes, I call it that for lack of a better name. How many times had I offered help to someone and nothing like that had happened, that is, the person was still alive. Why this now?

Maybe you're wondering now why I decided to use this “power” to help people. And, knowing that this will reveal a lot of my personality, I say: get out of the routine. Really, without noble or bad motivations, just to get out of the routine. And allow me a little more sincerity? Did not work. It's like I told you, it's become too common. And what fun is there, right?

Of course, there were some accidents. Once I was at the market and I went to help a man with a carton of milk and I said:

*Let me help you with that*

And that's it, the man fell hard. The good thing about this is that it's easy to get away with it, after all, people drop dead every day, right? So just get down on your knees, try to provide first aid, shout for someone to call an ambulance, simple and efficient. Except for the first time, I never received suspicious looks or anything like that. Have I been blessed twice? I don't dare say yes, but it's a question that crosses my mind daily.

I need to correct something. Remember I said that this “power” has become commonplace and there is nothing fun about it? Well, there is something interesting about him. It's the period of time in which I say “let me help” or “I can help you with that” and the person falls to the floor. This infinitesimal cut makes something run through me that I can't define. A thrill? A joy? No,that's not it. The closest I can come is to say that it seems like a form of liberation, a break from pre-established conventions and agreements between us and Nature, you know? It's as if the secrets of existence were revealed in that instant and nothing seems real or important. As if a veil was torn and revealed the chaos that we ignored and swept under the rug. Everything and nothing represented between an action and consequence. Yes, that's the only thing this “power” makes me feel.

Now, do you still want me to introduce myself to you? Or do you already know enough? Remember what I said at the beginning about being cautious when meeting someone new? A truth that we sometimes ignore is that actions can say much more than beautiful and well-chosen words of presentation. After all, we hide in speech and show ourselves in actions. And that's how our beautiful world works, isn't it? It is something beyond our control, beyond our understanding. What, dou you have any doubts? Well, come here then. ***I can help you with that.***
