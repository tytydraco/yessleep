 

They told us that if we participated in the study, we would get paid thousands. At first, I was thrilled by the announcement of free money. I mean, who wouldn’t? 

Me and 11 other people sat and waited for the announcement that the scientist told us to wait for.

The scientist kept his credentials anonymous and mostly spoke to us through a loudspeaker in the corner of the room. Mysteriously, he would prefer to be called “the Flower Dev” and nobody knew why. I tried asking the staff, and they all had the same answer:

“I don’t know”, a young, beautiful woman in a black lab coat replied. “Not even *we* know why he wants to be named that”.

I shook my head in affirmation and started to make my way to the other people who were participating in the experiment. Still looking for answers, (due to the lack of explanation given by the staff) I thought that my colleagues might know; Therefore, I approached them.

I scanned the room, eyeing each one as my brain hummed with curiosity. We were all bald due to the conditions of the experiment, and almost everyone was wearing black jumpsuits. Almost everyone…

One member was wearing a white jumpsuit, and he did not look friendly. He looked like he could play as John Rambo. Gathering my courage, I walked towards the man. As I made my way towards him, he turned his face round to face me and suddenly I had the sudden urge to turn and run.

His face bore multiple long scars that made their way down his eyes, and to his chin. One eye seemed to be permanently closed, as if he had somehow blinded himself in the past.

His cold gaze melted my curiosity down to its last drop. I was simply frozen in place, unable to move. I gathered the last of my determination and courage into a single sentence. Luckily I had taken lessons on human nature and emotions so I knew how to appear calm in this situation.

“Hello Mister, I’ve got a few questions for you. If you don’t mind I just want some info about what we are in for, you know?”.

The horrible silence sent more shivers down my spine. 

“Call me Fear”, he said in a cold, bone chilling but eerily quiet tone.

I gulped.

“Alright Fear, nice to meet yo—”

Fear suddenly pointed at his chest, where the name tag that he was given was pinned. It read “Fearless”.

“You called me Mister when my name was right there in front of you, “Hellflame”.

Struck by the rudeness of this “Fear” guy, I stayed quiet in case his impoliteness turned into anger. The fact that he had said my real name out loud also caught me off guard.

“Just call me Hell, Fear”.

“Whatever”. Fear eyed me for what seemed like an eternity. Everyone in the room was now staring at Fear and I out of curiosity and interest.

Finally, he sighed.

“I have participated in this test before, and it isn’t all fun and rainbows. It will destroy you both physically and mentally, and if you aren’t dead, you are *cursed* to come back again”.

Dead silence. No one spoke or made a sound.

“It’s a game simulation!” Fear said, his voice rising catastrophically. The staff in the room were clearly terrified of Fear, due to the fact they all left the room after that outburst.

“They put you in a FRICKIN CHILDREN’S GAME AND KILL EACH OTHER! You have no chance of surviving whatsoever…I only survived because people died for me.”

The heavy metal door slammed shut as the last staff member hurried out of the room.

Surprisingly, Fear’s eyes began to fill with tears. I almost felt sorry for him. More surprisingly, someone spoke up in the midst of the tears.

“Um, what the hell do you mean by a ‘children’s game?’” He said in a shaky voice. Everyone now had focused their full attention to Fear instead of the locked iron door on the other side of the room. Clearly they were all intrigued and wanted to know more about what we are in for.

“You’ll see”, he replied.

“You’ll all see what hell truly is”. He muttered, tears rolling down his cheeks. I wondered what had happened to him and what he experienced in this so-called “children’s game”. More importantly, will we survive? Or end up either dead or mentally unstable like Fear.

I didn’t want to think about it anymore.

“M-maybe I shouldn’t have joined this experiment”. Someone in the room said.

Everyone muttered in response as the realisation of hopelessness and death hit them like a missile strike. I didn’t know what exactly they were thinking, but all I knew is that they were definitely rethinking their choices about participating; I know I was.

A woman from the corner of the room began to sob quietly, however still managed to drown out the muttering of everyone else in the room. A few moments later, others had also lost hope, and more and more people began to weep in hopelessness and fear.

The scientific term for this is called E̶̗̽ṃ̶̈́ò̷̼t̸̗̚ì̶̼o̶̝͒n̷̹̽ǎ̴͕ḽ̷̀ ̵̺͆C̴̩̈́ò̵̜n̶̨̆ẗ̶̙a̴̞͗g̵͂͜i̶̡͆ō̶̡n̴̲̚, and I could only watch as it spread expeditiously around the room.
