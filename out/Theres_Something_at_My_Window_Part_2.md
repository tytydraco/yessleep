I met with my therapist this week, and we discussed the writing assignment she’d given me and how it’s been going so far. She didn’t push for any details but was instead more interested how I felt about the process as a whole, which I was thankful for. I wouldn’t consider myself someone who is predisposed to happiness, but even I can admit that writing about that night, terrible as it was, felt good. It felt like something had been… lifted, if even just for a second.

I shared all this with my therapist, and she encouraged me to write again, pushed me to go deeper. Since I’m having a hard time sleeping tonight, I figured I’d follow her advice and give this another try. After all, there’s a lot more story left to tell. And after that first night, there was a lot of terror yet to come.

\---------------------------------------

I moved through the early morning like a robot, dressing and making my bed with a heavy fog wrapped around my brain, intangible yet strangling. I didn’t feel that I was *seeing* the world with my own eyes as much as I was *watching* it from a place much further back in my head, peering out through two holes on the other side of a wide, empty cavern. The acute terror I’d felt the night before at the finger’s sudden appearance, combined with the incessant, lingering dread left behind by its equally sudden disappearance, had me feeling exhausted. Even though I eventually fell asleep, it couldn’t have been for more than two or three hours at most. My half-lidded eyes were accompanied by a sore back that screamed whenever I twisted or stooped, courtesy of my bedroom wall.

My mom was long gone by the time I made my way downstairs to the kitchen, having left for work several hours before. On the counter, I found a yellow sticky note next to two twenty-dollar bills. The note read:

*Got invited to Friday night karaoke! Might make some actual friends tonight! I left you some money for pizza. Things might go pretty late, so I’ll probably see you tomorrow morning. Pancakes for breakfast, I promise! Love, Mom.*

The kitchen somehow felt more silent now than it had just moments before I’d read the note, and my throat tightened as the realization dawned on me that I’d be left alone all night. All. Night. I started to feel dizzy and gripped the lip of the counter for support. I needed to eat something. Trying to shake the feeling of terror growing in the pit of my stomach, I grabbed the box of Cheerios sitting on top of our fridge and began to pour myself a bowl. That turned out to be the wrong move.

As the cereal tumbled from the box into the bowl, hollow grain hitting polished ceramic, the sound of it made my spine freeze in place. It sounded just… just like…

*Tink.*

*Tink.*

*Tink.*

*T-*

The next thing I remember, I was on my knees, clutching the side of the guest bathroom toilet as I vomited. As an adult, I know what a panic attack looks like, clear as day. I know how to handle them, how to soothe myself out of them in a constructive way. As a kid, all I knew was that I was scared. So scared.

After my stomach had finished purging itself and my rapid heart rate had slowed back to something resembling normal, I sat shivering on the cold tile floor of the bathroom. When my wits finally came back, I gritted my teeth and heaved myself off the floor. I wiped my eyes, washed out my mouth, and then headed back down the hallway, the terror having at least worn itself down to a dull fatigue.

In the kitchen, things were just as I’d left them. The cereal box lay on its side on the countertop, its contents spilled out over the laminate. After what felt like years standing there, still as a statue, accompanied only by the sound of my own breathing, I did just about the only thing I could think to do.

It took me two minutes to change my clothes, another two to brush my teeth, and about thirty more seconds to pull my shoes on and grab the money my mom left me from the countertop. After that, I was out the door, not sure of where I was going but knowing that I sure as hell wasn’t going to stay in that house another second longer.

\--------------------------------------- 

The house we’d moved into was in a new subdivision of homes just outside the center of town, about a forty-five-minute walk along newly paved sidewalks. My mom’s business hadn’t been the only one to build offices in the area over the past few decades, and since the people that moved there tended to stay, housing continued to expand outward into a region that grew very rural very quickly.

My own neighborhood brushed up against a large forest, the same one that my mom had been gathering flowers from to build her budding garden over the past few weeks. I was told that the woods eventually linked up with a large state forest, and then an even bigger state park after that. It was like a system of tributaries made of roots and brambles, growing more wild and more untamed as it went along. As I walked the sidewalk toward town, the side of the road grew more refined with each step, the tall billowing grasses replaced by patches of bright green sod kept manicured by the city.

By the time I made it to the center of town, the back of my shirt was soaked through with sweat, the July heat baking the road and sidewalk and causing the air to ripple as it rose off the pavement. A wind occasionally blew across the road, but even that was hot, dry, and full of dust. A few teenagers rode past me on their skateboards. I tried to muster a half-hearted wave. They either didn’t see me or didn’t care, because nobody waved back.

There wasn’t much to do downtown, but there was at least enough to distract myself for a day. That was all I really needed. I tried the mall first, grabbing a soft pretzel with a few crumpled bills from my weekly allowance and walking around to peer into stores that I couldn’t afford to shop in. It was a fine enough activity, but even then, the dull, throbbing fear that was seated deep in my chest pulsed every now and again, reminding me it was there. Whenever I blinked, there would be the image of the yellow nail tapping at my window, painted across the inside of my eyelids.

Even worse, my growing paranoia began to seep its way into every place I looked. The whole time I strode around the mall, just out of the corner of my eyes would be… something. It wasn’t necessarily a person; it wasn’t that distinct. But it wasn’t incorporeal enough for me to simply call it a shadow. Yet all the while it was there, sitting right on the blurred edge of my peripheral vision, making the hair on my arms ripple with goosebumps. But right when I’d look directly at it… it was gone.

The feeling grew worse and worse until finally I passed a shoe store, walking along the polished window to gaze at the rows and rows of the new Nikes on display. I leaned forward to look at a particular pair, mentally building my Christmas list for December. My eyes swept across the black trim, the red soles, the patterned laces, my face reflected there in the glass, and behind that, the crescent moon of another face, hidden behind my head, peeking out ever so slightly, the corner of its mouth curling up into a smile, its eyes a sickening color of—

I felt something breathe on the back of my neck.

I screamed, dropping my pretzel. It skidded across the mall floor. As I yelped, I jumped hard enough that my forehead smacked the glass of the display window, and I whipped around as I recoiled to find… nothing. Again.

A group of kids walked by, snickering at me. A mother passed me with her young daughter, scowling at me while she grabbed the girl’s wrist and quickened her pace. An old couple sat in the food court nearby, silently sharing a small cup of frozen yogurt. But there was nothing like what I saw in the glass a moment before. My hands shaking, I didn’t even bother to pick my food up off the floor. I was already running toward the exit.

I tried going to the theater a few blocks away, hoping that a movie could drown out my anxiety for just a few hours. I picked the loudest, stupidest action movie I could find, bought a gigantic tub of popcorn with the rest of my allowance money and some of mom’s pizza money, and sat in the back row of a theater with a smattering of young families and a few teenage couples on dates. For a while, my plan worked, but I still kept feeling like something wasn’t right. Every few minutes, my eyes would dance away from the screen and flick over the room again and again.

Normally, my roving eye movements revealed nothing, and I’d see the same few groups of people sitting just as they had been minutes before. It continued to turn up nothing until about halfway through the film, when I looked down at the first row. There, a figure sat rigidly watching the movie, silhouetted against the bright lights of the screen. It hadn’t been there moments before, and from my vantage point, I would have *definitely* seen them enter the theater. With my stomach in knots, my eyes flicked toward the entrance of the theater and then back to… nothing. No one was sitting in the front row any longer.

You can guess how much longer I stayed there.

I couldn’t tell you what I did with the rest of my afternoon. I just have vague memories of walking around downtown, the sun burning my skin and the heat drenching my shirt, my dull eyes on the cracked pavement in front of me. But eventually I had to face the music. Eventually, I had to go home.

When I finally got back to my house, sweaty and exhausted, I wound my way around to the backyard to walk through the garden. I lazily held out my arm as I strode between patches of raised flower beds, letting my fingers brush against the brightly colored petals. When I arrived at the end of the row, I bent down to smell the bed of purple lilacs my mom had planted, siblings to the ones currently sitting in a pot up in my room.

The delicate, honey-like smell filled my nostrils as I breathed in, and I thought of mom. She was probably wrapping up work, chatting with her coworkers, readying to spend time with other adults her own age. I could picture her smile, her excitement. It made me smile in turn. And it chased away the darkness just a little bit.

I couldn’t spend the rest of the evening in my room. I just couldn’t, not with the scratched glass of my windowpane staring at me the entire time. Instead, I decided to move my PS2 down to the living room TV, draw the blinds, and play well into the night. I only stopped long enough to call for a pizza and wolf the whole thing down. I played level after level, my concentration unbroken and undisturbed, until I finally began to hope that what had happened the night before was all in my head, or at least that whatever had come to visit me had gotten what it wanted already.

That thought was quickly interrupted by a soft rumbling noise coming from the hallway, mixed intermittently with scratches and thumps. My fingers froze over my controller, gripping the plastic like a vice. This sound was different from the one at my window last night, and it took me a few seconds to realize that it was the sound of… someone shaking the handle of the front door. Trying to get inside.

A heavy *thunk* sounded from the hallway just on the other side of the living room wall as they succeeded, twisting the handle and throwing their body weight against the door to cause it to open. They strode down the hallway toward the living room, where I sat motionless in terror on the couch, their footsteps booming louder and louder until…

“We *need* to call a locksmith,” my mom said as she entered the room, rubbing her right shoulder, which she had to lay into the door to free the stuck handle.

At least, that’s what I thought she said. I was too busy screaming to really hear her.

\---------------------------------------

I woke up on the couch the next morning to light streaming in through the living room windows. Mom had pulled up the blinds to let the sun in. I groaned and twisted my stiff neck to look over at the clock on the wall. 11:00. I’d slept almost twelve hours. I got up, stretched, and found my way out to the backyard, where my mom had her Saturday gardening clothes on, kneeling next to one of the raised beds while she planted a few bunches of red flowers.

“You missed pancakes,” she said with a smile.

“I guess I needed the sleep,” I replied, rubbing my eyes.

Mom and I had eventually laughed off the misunderstanding from the night before, when I’d thought she’d been a creature invading our home to kill and eat me. After chatting on the couch for a while after that, she’d eventually gone off to bed. It didn’t take long for me to follow suit, nodding off right there on the couch.

“How about we do it for dinner?” she asked, stabbing at the mulch with a trowel.

“That’s the best idea I’ve heard all day,” I replied.

“Only on *one* condition, though,” she added, raising her index finger upward and then pointing at, or rather through, the house. “Bring the hose around for me, would you?”

I smiled back and went on my way, rounding the side of the house while the grass poked the bottoms of my bare feet and then squished under my weight. I kept my smile plastered on my face even after I’d found the hose at the front of the house, just below the living room windows. How could I not smile when I had slept so undisturbed? The finger was starting to feel like a bad dream already.

As I gathered the hose, however, looping the snaking rubber in a coil around my arm, something caught my eye that made my smile fall. I walked closer to inspect the patch of mulch next to the hose, right in front of the living room’s center window. There in the soft, springy dirt were two rectangular depressions, evenly spaced and evenly sized, directly under the windowsill.

It took a few seconds for my brain to register that I was staring at footprints. In mulch that dry, it would have taken hours of unbroken standing to make prints that deep. Hours. With shaky breath, I drew my gaze upward to look inside the living room from the vantage point of the footprints. My eyes locked directly on the couch, where I’d lain sleeping all night.

As I looked into the room, something on the top right of the window caught my eye. Five little pinpricks sat in an arc on the glass. I already suspected what they were, but I had to know for sure. I raised a trembling hand and pressed it into the glass, my fingers splaying out to end at each of the marks. It was a handprint, one that had been pressed so hard into the window that the glass cracked under the point of each nail. Almost as if the owner of the hand was… angry. Enraged.

Something had been at my window again last night, staring at me for hours on end. And they did so through the drawn blinds, the entire time I slept. Either they could see me through the blinds, or they didn’t need to in order to know I was there. I don’t know which idea I hated more.

As I vomited last night’s pizza into the mulch below, I knew in my heart that whatever had first tapped at my bedroom window had come to visit again. And though I still didn’t know what its motivations were, I knew one thing about it; It was very, very interested in me. So interested, in fact, that it could watch me all night. Never moving. Never wavering.

In hindsight, I’d have preferred even that to what came next. Because that wasn’t the last time the visitor would come to me. On the third night, it finally told me what it wanted.
