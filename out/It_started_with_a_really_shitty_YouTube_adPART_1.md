The Ad: [https://youtu.be/-LySz6BN6f0?si=Bj16egHy3458ELs2](https://youtu.be/-LySz6BN6f0?si=Bj16egHy3458ELs2)



It started with a really shitty YouTube ad. A mix between a youtuber and bad infomercial salesman. And to add to the assault on the senses, the ad was interrupted. And not like a fun interruption, but some gross stock video, that left me uneasy.



But the ad never got taken down. It would show up late at night and early in the morning. For six whole months the ad played in the background. It never got taken down or addressed.



I had forgotten about it, until this morning when, much to my dismay, a sign appeared in the local drug store window. A sign, advertising the drug with simple wording that read “ Got weight? Try WeightX.” 



Was it real? A drug that just permanently gets rid of weight problems?



It just seemed unlikely, and if it was real, who would risk what could happen when you take such a permanent thing? 



The effects and consequences of such spun in my head as I walked down the street. The cracks on the sidewalk of my hometown reflecting my own inner conflicts. Suddenly a voice came from ahead of me “Matt? If you keep your head down like that you'll walk straight out of town. Is something on your mind?” 



Suddenly I came back from the confines of my mind and found, before me, my friend of four years, Danny. More stout than me, he not only towered a solid six inches above me, he also did a good job shielding me from the morning sun. His shaggy slightly greasy brown hair gave way to a pudgy, friendly face .He leaned against the pole waiting on me to catch up. He was used to my normal spacy nature.



I hastened my pace and met him at the corner of the street and continued with him towards school.

It was still early morning in the small town, and probably one of the busiest times for it. The activity all stemmed from the school and what workers were getting up and getting breakfast. 



My school is small and our senior class only has around 50 people in the whole grade. The town matches that size, having only @@@ people in its population. Because of its size, it's hard to meet anyone you don't know from somewhere. And it's just as hard to keep a secret. Because of that not much goes on here without half the town knowing about it before the days end.



As we continued our walk to school, my mind lingered on the new drug. Turning to now fully face and acknowledge my friend I ask, “ have you been getting those  bad YouTube ads for that new drug?” He looked up to the left, searching his brain for something, before finally opening his mouth and beginning “ Those ones from Freshlyf?”

“Yeah those,” I return with only half the enthusiasm of the first question. 

“What did you think, you don't think it's actually real, do you?” I asked, trying to lead him to ease my concerns.

“ You mean, if a drug that is not only permanent, but also gets rid of weight problems, increases muscle growth and promotes hair loss could be real? Hell no, and if it was, I would ask you how fast it kills you.” He spat back, obvious disbelief coloring his words.



Relaxing a bit I looked over my shoulder towards the pharmacy, “ well you better tell them that, I guess they fell for a YouTube prank.” 

“You don't mean, you don’t think that they actually have some kind of pill, do you?”

“ No way, right?” I returned to him, slightly anxiously knowing where his logic was going to jump to.

“We have to check it out after school, I mean I won't be able to sleep now until I do?”

And there it was , what I feared he would say. but I would be lying if I said I wasn't curious as well. So I didn't say anything, but the cold morning air gave me goose bumps. And so it seemed like the plans were set in stone.

The school day was a slog of text and paper that only increased the amount of time I spent in my head, lingering, on Freshlyf, and on the drug that they had supposedly produced. Freshlyf was real, they have been a power player in innovation for the last 35 years. Absolutely dominating the market and nearly driving out all other competitors. 

But WeightX?

That is entirely new.

And seemingly underfunded for what it is claiming to be. Almost like a test run?



The confines of my mind dissipated as the second to last bell rings and the final period starts, P.E. Coming to my senses after all the monotony I realize how close our plan is to actually happening, and how close I am to actually finding out if WeightX is real.



As I am going to last period I heard a group of girls gossiping.

“Did you see the new drug at the pharmacy?”



“ The one that fixes weight problems?”



“Yeah, that one, I can think of a few girls in this town that could use that, no wonder they released it here first.”



“That's mean Stacy, but what do you mean here first?”



“I asked a friend from the next town over, and her pharmacy doesn't have it.”



Unconsciously I had slowed down to hear most of the conversation. Noticing my lag I hurried to my next class. What did they mean, why is it here first?



P.E. went off without a hitch. I'm not an athlete but I am not unfit. 



And then as if on que, the final bell rang, and the hordes of trapped teens sprang loose. And then meeting in the stream like two unlikely salmon, I bumped into Danny.



Once our eyes met, I could tell we had the same thing on our mind. 



WeightX



The walk to the pharmacy was less than five minutes, we made it in two. And breathing out our mouths we entered the pharmacy.



As it turned out, other classmates were interested, and the pharmacy was filled with curious teens and parents.



As we watched the dozen people ahead of us we watched as one by one they are given the same song and dance.



“ so, this is an experimental drug, its contents are proprietary. If you understand the risks and are still willing to take the prescription, please sign this document.”

 

After they sign they are given a small pill bottle with a single red and white pill inside.



After finally getting to us the pharmacist visibly looks tired. He looks at us, perking up in mild recognition. 



“You heard me one of those times, right?”



We both nod, eager to sign and see the product for ourselves.



…



Rolling the pill around in the bottle, the idea that this single pill could change you forever seemed insane to me, and is asking for a false advertising lawsuit.



Looking over at Danny he seems to be looking at his bottle with wonder.



“ Hey Danny?”

I call out



“Huh, yeah, what's up?”

He said looking back at me.



“You're not actually going to try that pill are you?”



Danny's face flashed with something like embarrassment before answering.

“ Well I have to admit I'm really curious, plus I already have it.”



“Were you not the one that said it would probably kill you?”



“ yeah, maybe, but that was before it was right here in my hands.”



“ I really wouldn't dude, there is no way that it works. Best case scenario it does nothing.”



“Err, wrong. Best case scenario, I get skinny, fit, hot, and leave you jealous.”



“ Whatever dude, I guess at least tell me if you actually decide to take it.”



“Yeah , sure.”



Shortly after, we parted ways and I continued on home. Once I got there I was swiftly welcomed by my mother, Katherine. She sat on the couch lounging on her laptop. She has a similar build to me, thin but fit, in addition to brown shoulder length hair.



“ How was your day?”

She asked, half interested, her mind still mostly busy typing something on her laptop.



“Not bad, same old, same old.”

I said trying to end it quickly



“Same here”



Making my usual escape I leave with a

“ I love you, see you in the morning.”



…



Once I got to my room, I shut the door and removed the pill bottle from my pocket. Looking into the bottle, the single red and white pill still sat lonely at the bottom. Not willing to wait any longer, I emptied the bottle contents into the palm of my hand. 



Rolling the single pill in my palm I studied it. To me it looked no different from any other cap pill, only I didn't see any kind of identifiers or serial numbers on it. After some thought, I decided to open it, and see what was inside.



Stealthy, so that I could avoid being social, I crept down and retrieved a paper plate. Once I got back to my room I carefully took the pill, shook it close to my ear, heard nothing, and finally opened it up onto the plate.



At first I thought there was nothing in the pill, until I took a closer look. It was empty, except for a single tan spec. Like one single tan colored grain of sand it sat alone on the plate. 



What. The. Actual. Hell?



Who fucking makes this shit. Is it some kind of joke? Or a marketing ploy?



Either way I am not as enchanted as I once was. 



I whip out my phone and take a picture to send to my friend, along with…



“Hope you didn't get your hopes up, looks like its a sugar pill to me lol”



He replied with



“Already took it✌️”



 “Damn, that was fast”

  


I chuckled to myself. Of course he took it without looking or caring. He should be glad it's harmless.



Looking back to the plate and grabbing a pencil.

I begin to poke the grain, pushing it around the plate. As I do , the grain unfolds slightly. In my boredom I continue to play with it until it looks to me like it softened to resemble eraser shavings.



Suddenly, I realized, what if this substance, whatever it is, needs to be wet or ingested to work. All of a sudden I felt a little stupid for writing it off immediately.



I ran down stairs again, this time not caring about being seen, but ignoring any call outs.



I brought back a glass of water, into which I placed the grain.



I sat there and watched, got bored, checked, forgot, checked one last time and went to bed. During my whole process nothing changed, and I drifted into complacent sleep.



I awoke in the morning to find that my experiment was vandalized in the middle of the night. I didn't leave my door completely closed last night and the dog must have gotten in. Because in the morning, unless it dissolved, my glass of water was empty.



Huffing and puffing while getting dressed, my mind churned with unsatisfied thoughts about the contents of the pill. Was it really nothing, maybe dirt or even some erasure shavings from school?



Well today is Friday, and I'm sure several classmates tried it, I know Danny definitely took it.



From below my mothers voice echoed

“Come grab your breakfast”



After getting ready I head down the stairs and to the kitchen. Running up next to the fridge I press a few buttons on the atomic food maker and wait thirty seconds. Afterwards, I reached in and grabbed my breakfast muffin and ran off to school.



The walk to school was short, I took a route that went through a couple peoples yards and popped out to the main street. I've taken this route for years and usually meet up with Danny at the stop sign just before school.



But today he was waiting for me across the street from where I popped out of. 



As he ran across the street I could make out his details more clearly. I know it had only been a day but to me his face looked thinner and his hair had a healthier shine to it, as opposed to the normal grease that was there.



“Hey!”

He called out to me, as he finished crossing the street.



“What's up? We usually meet up at the stop sign.”



“Oh, you know, just feeling like a thousand bucks”

He said confidently pointing at himself with his thumb.



“ Why is that? Do you actually feel different after taking the pill?”



“Not immediately, but when I woke up this morning I felt great. Like I could jump over a building."

He said with enthusiasm.



“ Have you felt any of the side effects?”

I asked, concern mixing with my voice.



“ No, none so far.”

He said dismissively



The conversation shifted focus after this as we started on our way to school.

 

Getting to school was like entering a new country.

Not only were people acting, looking, and speaking differently, but the very air seemed to vibrate with change.



I could see some once skinny teens now easily dunking basketballs. I thought I knew everyone but I saw people flirting in halls that I did not recognize.



In the morning chaos I lost Danny, and found myself nearly alone outside on a bench. I say nearly because a girl sits on the front steps writing something in a journal or note book. She ignores me as I ignore her.



I sit outside and clear my head. The cool morning air wakes me. All around me these people seem to change, and for the better, but in my gut I feel a sickening churning. Like the kind of anxiety you have when you have a nightmare about a plane crash.



I thought I would be more excited. Especially seeing so many changed and seemingly happy people. But I still feel like something is up. 



Just then, as if to snap me out of my own mind, the girl that sat at the stairs moved across from me. She had brown hair that flowed down her shoulders and spilled into her hood. She wore black large brimmed glasses and had dark brown eyes that were underlined by a river of freckles, but as I followed her gaze she wasn't looking at me. Instead her eyes followed a grasshopper that had made its bed in front of me while I stared into the void.



“what are you doing?”

I asked.



She just held up a finger to her mouth in a slow motion before she sprang forth with a sudden burst of energy and caught the grasshopper.

I jerked back and wore a confused look as I watched her take the grasshopper and place it somewhere in her bag.

“Why are you catching grass hoppers?”

I asked again.



“I love to catch grasshoppers, well mostly as free food, I just have to always get rid of their worms first.”

She replied



“Are you eating them?”

I said, shocked at her apparent poverty.



“No,” she chuckled. “I have a pet tarantula, I guess I should have specified.”



“Oh my god, I really thought you were eating insects.” I said, a little embarrassed.



“ no, I'm not, but my spider is. And nothing beats free food, I just like to get rid of the parasites if I can.”



“Are there parasites in the grasshoppers?”



“Oh yeah, most wild things have parasites in them, grasshoppers especially.”



“That's really gross to think about.”

I say, the idea instinctively making my stomach turn.



“ Yeah, but almost every one has had a parasite at some point, even ticks are parasites. And you need some species to work properly, like symbiosis. Everyone always focuses on parasitism, but there are tons of species that live within us and other species. Sometimes where both are benefiting.”



“Still gross to think about. I don't like the idea of something else living in me and moving in me.”



She peaks over her glasses and looks at me over them.

“Have you ever heard of being pregnant?”



My face suddenly got flush as a small wave of embarrassment washed over me. 

“ I never thought about it like that.”



“Yeah, well, to be fair most babies don't cause harm or kill their mothers.”

She said solemnly.



At around that point the bell rang, signaling the start of school day.



We parted and exchanged “see ya”s



It was my senior year, but today felt like the first all over again.



I was never super social but I knew and recognized everyone. At least I used to, now I'm having to re-learn names. It's like half of the town, overnight, had access to plastic surgeons.



Shy kids that would slink back with me, now confidently answered questions. But I also started to notice other things. Some people would twitch. Sometimes just an eye, or a twitch of the head, but other times it will be whole limbs. You can at times see people in the hall spontaneously stomp their legs or make strange arm movements.



The pills were on everyone's lips, they were already swallowing the idea of it and loving it.



Around the fourth period the power went out, along with phone service. Many of those that carried the initial morning excitement changed into quiet disappointment. But after some time and realizing it's not going to come back on, school was let out early.



I found Danny in the after math, it had only been a few hours since I saw him but I swear he had gotten thinner. 



“ you wanna come over and hangout over the weekend?”

He asked nonchalantly.



“Sure, it's not like I can do much at home anyways. I just need to go back to my place to let mom know.”



“Oh, yeah, no cell service or anything. Well I'll walk with you.”



The walk back to my house was vibrant. The very air hummed with power. Or maybe that was cicadas. Their hum filled the open space, and today they could not only be heard but felt.

It reminded me of when I was in the city and could feel the towers drumming.



Once I got home I was greeted by the dog, he was a white shaggy thing that looked more like a used mop than a dog most days. But today his fur had a shine that he usually doesn't have unless we bathed him, which we haven't. Kneeling down I give him a good pet and go inside to warn my mother of my absence for the weekend.



The way to Danny's place was not long, and we filled it with idle talk and plans for the weekend.

A lot of “we can play this”, turning into, no “we can't play anything without power.”

 Danny never seemed to notice, but several times on the walk Danny would twitch his head or stomp one of his feet. If he didn't seem like he was doing great I would have pointed it out. 



The rest of the day we filled with airsoft. Unsurprisingly Danny had gotten much better at it.

Danny liked guns and had several real ones at his house that his father owns. 

Once the sun went down and the lights still refusing to come back on, we both went to bed early. I slept in a blanket pellet next to his bed.



My night was filled with tossing and turning, the uncomfortable bed and lack of fatigue kept me in an unpleasant state of non-unconsciousness. The dreams I did have were filled with insects, worms, and the sound of pasta stirring in a pot. 



I must have fallen asleep fully at some point because I awoke in the early hours of the morning. looking at the bed above and next to me I notice that Danny was gone. Noticing the bath room door closed and the light on I leave it be and lay back down.



While I have my eyes closed, I hear something. Like the sound of ham hitting a hard floor. I sit up. And go towards the noise. Standing in front of the bathroom now ,I can hear it more clearly. The sound of something wet slapping against tile.



I knocked. The door, not being fully closed, creaked open. Danny was leaning over the sink in boxers, his wide shoulders breathing heavy hard breaths, around the sink, red strips lay. I called out to my friend, but what turned around looked nothing like him. As he turned I could see what was left of his face. Huge chunks of his cheek were ripped out, at times still left hanging , revealing white sinew, bone and teeth. The skin from his left eye down was ripped off showing off most of his left eye. But despite all that, what horrified me the most was the look of fear and terror in his eyes. 



I stumbled back and fell to my ass. Danny looked at me then back to himself in the mirror before grabbing a kitchen knife and going back to work on his arm.



Getting back up I ran to him and grab him by the shoulders.



“What the fuck is wrong with you? Stop mutilating yourself!” I scream trying to restrain him.



Easily he bucks me off and continues.

“ I almost have them all.”

He says in a manic slurred voice.



“ You sound crazy.”

I say, feeling crazy myself.



Dramatically he digs in his arm and pulls hard. Ripping it out and holding it above him, almost for the whole world to see, is a single small strand of something. As he is holding it there and my eyes adjust I see it start to move and wriggle before starting to try and dig its way back into Danny’s thumb. 



“ I noticed last night, I could feel it, deep in me. And a couple hours ago, I felt it, in my face moving up and down beneath my skin.” he said ignoring the thread moving up his arm and clawing back at his face.



I looked on in disgust as he ripped another chunk out of himself. As it hit, then lay on the floor, I saw now that it undulated softly, like maggots in flesh.



“Every strip I took off had more than the last.”

Looking at the floor now I see that, slowly, the mass of flesh seems to start grouping together.



Not able to take anymore I exit the bathroom.



I sat and listened, waiting for the horrible noise to stop. And eventually it did, hours later. I didn't have the guts to open the door and check what happened. Nor did I have the guts to tell his mom, but as ashamed as I am to admit, I took one of his dads guns. I feel like he would want me to have one, and after seeing that, I wasn't gonna leave without a weapon.
