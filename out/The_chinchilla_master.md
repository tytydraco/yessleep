I was driving home from work late one night when I saw a figure walking on the side of the road. I slowed down to get a better look, and realized that it was a woman. She was wearing a white dress and had her hair pulled back in a bun. She looked like she was in her early twenties. I asked her if she needed a ride, but she just looked at me and smiled. I got out of the car and asked her again if she needed help, but she just kept walking. I decided to follow her.

She led me to an old abandoned house on the edge of town. I asked her what she was doing there, but she just smiled at me again. I followed her into the house, and she led me to a room in the back. There was a bed in the middle of the room, and a woman was lying in it. She was wearing a white dress and had her hair pulled back in a bun. She looked like she was in her early twenties.

The woman in the bed opened her eyes and looked at me. She asked me to come closer, so I did. She told me her name was Alice and that she was very sick. She said she needed help, but I didn't  know what to do. I asked her what was wrong, but she just smiled at me and said, "I can't tell you. You have to help me."

I didn't know what to do, so I just sat with her for a while. We talked about our lives and what was happening in the world. She told me she was from a different time, and that she was stuck in this house. She said she needed my help to get back to her own time. I didn't know how to help her, but I promised her I would try.

I left the house and went to the library to do some research. I found out that the house was built in the 1800s and that it was abandoned in the early 1900s. I also found out that there was a woman who lived in the house in the early 1900s who was named Alice. I wondered if the woman I had met was the same Alice.

I went back to the house and talked to the woman again. I told her what I had found out, and she smiled at me. She said she was the same Alice and that she needed my help. She said she was stuck in this time and needed to get back to her own time. She asked me to help her, and I said I would.

Then, she revealed to me that she had died in a fight against a capybara and a carp. 

I was shocked and asked her how I could help her. She said she needed me to kill the capybara and the carp so she could be reincarnated and return to her own time. I didn't know how to kill a capybara, let alone a carp, but I said I would try.

She gave me a knife and told me to go to the pond in the woods. She said the capybara would be there, and that I needed to kill it. I took the knife and went to the pond. I saw the capybara and I tried to kill it, but it was too strong. I stabbed it over and over, but it just kept coming at me. I was about to give up when I heard the woman screaming. I turned around and saw that the carp had her in its mouth. I ran over and stabbed the carp in the head, killing it.

The woman was free, but she was badly injured. I took her to the hospital, but she died a few days later. I never saw her again, but I know she is in a better place now. 

But then. She came back alive, and revealed herself and the chinchilla master. 

I was shocked and asked her how I could help her. She said she needed me to kill the chinchilla so she could be reincarnated and return to her own time. I didn't know how to kill a chinchilla, let alone a carp, but I said I would try.

She gave me a knife and told me to go to the pond in the woods. She said the chinchilla would be there, and that I needed to kill it. I took the knife and went to the pond. I saw the chinchilla and I tried to kill it, but it was too strong. I stabbed it over and over, but it just kept coming at me. I was about to give up when I heard the woman screaming. I turned around and saw that the carp had her in its mouth. I ran over and stabbed the carp in the head, killing it.

The woman was free, but she was badly injured. I took her to the hospital, but she died a few days later. I never saw her again, but I know she is in a better place now. Sometimes when I dream, I have a vision of that evil carp, grinning menacingly at me. And in the background, I can hear the chinchilla master laughing...
