As a sailer, it is your job to feed your family and keep them alive. Every day you take your boat, fishing gear and your jacket incase it begins to rain, and then you set off.
Last time you went out, a fishlike creature came near your boat. You hope it’s not like last time, and carlessly paddels the boat longer and longer out. You take your fishing gear and begin to fish. As you fish, you notice a dark shadow under your boat, but you figure it might just be the boat.
A while later theres silence. Complete silence. No bird are screaming, and not a single wave. The wind is not blowing, and you sit in your boat when it begins. A beautiful voice begins to sing a foreign song and you listen to it as it is the prettiest voice you have ever heard. Your limbs begins to move without your permission, but why would it matter? The beautiful voice is everything you hear as your body brings you closer to the sound.
She’s horrifying yet so pretty, and you cant decide if she’s a threat or not. She is still singing, a fantastic song or is it her voice making it good? You watch her and study her as she comes closer to your boat. Her feet aren’t visible, her legs neither. Her hair is long and dark, almost black, and her big eyes are seagreen with a hint of gold. Her teeth are horrifying as they are razor sharp and in the size of your thumbnail. She has a curvy body, no visible clothes and you note that her skin closest to the water is darker, turning black it looks like. Thats when she stops singing. “S- si- siren!” You exclaim and do tour best to paddle away from the horrifying creature, going against your feelings as she is also beautiful. She looks to be around 20, but looks can fool, you tell yourself. You paddle faster, expecting to hear the song again, but it doesn’t come. Insted you her a crash and the boat takes water in. You look down and see a webbed hand with claws at the end of each finger. You feel all color dissapear from your face as you note your destiny. The boat slowly goes down, and just before it goes under, she appears again. She’s singing again, keeping you from screaming or doing any harm to her. Her voice is magical and puts you in a trance as she enters the boat. Her hips is the last part that can identify as ‘human’. The rest is a long black tail with two smaller fins down on the way to the two actual fins. As you turn your look to her again, her eyes are black, and her ears are like small fins, designed for water. She smiles, showing you her sharklike teeth as she grabs you and pulls you with her down under the water.
You wake up underwater, not knowing why you’re still alive as the siren had pulled you under. Thats untill you look down. Instead of legs you now have a tail, almost identical with the siren’s tail. Confused and scared you look around in the cave you’re in. “Welcome.” A girl says. You turn around and stare at the siren who kidnapped you. “You- this isn’t real!” You try to convince yourself. “It is real. Do you need pain to understand realism?” She asks. You shake your head. The siren looks dissapointed and comes closer. A strange feeling hits you. A feeling that normally only comes when you see your wife. The siren comes closer and closer untill only centimeters are between you. 
She looks you in the eyes and then lowers her look before she smiles and her claws dig through your stomach. The water turns red as she rips you apart, piece by piece. Her smile is the last thing you ever see before everything turns black, and you leave the living’s world.
