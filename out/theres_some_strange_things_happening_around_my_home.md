i don't know where else to post this. my name is Randy, i live alone and recently left my job at a gas station. i worked the graveyard shift so i wasn't home for most of the night. i've been noticing strange things happening around my property at night lately. at first it was just noises but now things are moving around without any good explanation.

to start, i don't understand how a shovel could be displaced in a field, fairly far from my house. i haven't touched it in months and it wasn't in a easily accessible spot either. i tend to joke and talk about the supernatural every once in awhile, so i immediately thought of the idea of it being some sort of creepy thing. i know that's silly and i'm fully aware that there's probably a much simpler and more realistic explanation i just haven't thought of yet. but something just feels off now.

it's important to mention that 2 weeks ago, i had a friend over and he said he thought he saw something in the woods around my home. this was before i started noticing anything. he said it looked like a man. we don't drink or do anything of that nature and knowing him, he's not the kind to play a prank on me like that. i didn't exactly brush it off but, i didn't like the thought of us checking it out just in case it was a convict or something. 

about 5 days after i left my job, i was outside around midnight to grab some pliers from my storage room. in the car port of my house, there's a small room for stuff. when i was in there i noticed my shovel missing. i don't remember the last time i needed it and it was tucked behind a shelf so i doubt a thief would find it. not to mention, everything else(as far as i know)was untouched. i got a really weird feeling and decided to check again in the morning. the next day i looked for my shovel and actually found it. i don't know how to excuse this. it's just simply odd. the shovel was stuck, blade side, in a tree about 15 feet up. understand, the blade was in the tree, like something stabbed it. also, it's a shovel, it's not particularly sharp. i don't understand how this could possibly happen, even by supernatural standards, it's really weird.

before that event, i'd hear noises at night on weekends but never anything too unsettling. normally just sounds of nature and things moving around like cats and stuff. however, sometimes i'd hear something really odd, not particularly interesting without the prior context. one night i heard an echoed yell. i live near woods and it's not unusual to hear the calls of animals in the area. this specific yell didn't sound a lot like a coyote but i just assumed it was. some coyotes do sound kinda weird so i brushed it off, slightly unsettled. i've been thinking of it recently and it makes me feel sick. like something really was wrong and deep down i knew it.

this is where i'll end it off for now. i feel weird talking about this sorta thing because i feel like it only makes it more real.
