Hey everyone. I know this is going to sound weird, and honestly, I wish I didn’t have to share this. I’ve been debating about publishing this post for a couple of months now, but I can’t stop thinking about it. I need to get everything off my chest before it drives me insane.

Some context: I work at a Waffle House in a small town in North Carolina. We're located on a major highway near App State, so most of our business is either drunk college students or passerby headed further into the mountains. Hurricane Helene didn't hit us too hard, but the main highway into our town was wrecked and App State sent all of their students home for a few weeks because they didn't have power.

Since I was working night shifts and no one was coming in, my boss started giving me odd jobs. You know the ones: organizing the filing cabinet, scraping gum off the undersides of tables. One night, he wanted me to go through the lost and found.

Most of it was the usual crap— lighters, water bottles, someone's broken sunglasses, stuff like that. It was tucked underneath a jacket, like someone had shoved it in there on purpose. And from the outside, it looked like a seventh-grader's nasty composition notebook. Plain, college-ruled black marble with crude drawings and scratched into the sides by a pencil. No name, no identifying marks.

At first, I was going to toss it out with everything else, but for some reason, I decided to open it. Thought maybe it would give me some entertainment that night.

The first few pages were useless. Most were empty, or filled with to-do lists or chicken-scratch notes for a physics class. Others contained sketches of monkeys holding joints or skateboard designs. But towards the middle is when the diary entries started.

If any of this was true, the narrator was a real piece of shit, so I thought it had to be a joke or someone's creative writing project. But the more pages I turned, the more it felt like I *shouldn’t* be reading it. It’s like the journal was never meant to be found.

And there's this part at the end of the first entry that's really freaking me out. It speaks about this powerful demon servant— this *thing,* with shadows twisting around it, like it was more of a presence than a person.

The whole thing was giving me this nauseous feeling, so I looked it up. But here's the kicker: I can't find any traces of any of it. I hope to God it's made up, but there's just too much detail-- the places, the descriptions-- everything feels too true to life.

I don’t know what to do with the journal. I’ve still got it, but I’m not sure if I should keep it or throw it away. I can’t shake the feeling that there’s something more to it. Something *real*.

There are no dates, but the entires are numbered. I'm transcribing and posting the first diary entry with the hopes someone knows more details:

>***#1***

>When you come from a town like mine, alcoholism is pretty common. *It's unsurprising, but not unexpected*, as the guidance counselor had put it to my mom. *Have you thought about getting Tommy professional help?*

>At first, my drinking was innocuous. Beers with friends, swiped from somebody’s old white fridge in their garage. But by the fall of senior year, I was bringing vodka to school in a water bottle. Always drunk. I never told my friends, but I knew they had me figured out. The stench of liquor on my breath, the way I would be slurring my words by lunch.

>The cop who pulled me over that night was a friend of my dad's. Not a good enough friend to let me go, though. Just tightened the handcuffs and said “Sorry, son. You blew a 0.16.”

>When I told Lucas that story, he didn’t even look up from his desk– just kept erasing what he had written. The paper crumbled under him, and he huffed loudly before ripping another sheet from his notebook.

>“A DUI,” he snorted in disbelief, glancing over his shoulder. “They put you in here for drunk driving? It’s not like you killed anyone.”

>Lucas said he grew up in Charleston. I imagine he had one of those all-American childhoods: wrap-around porches, cicadas chirping on summer nights, sailing lessons. A frat house just waiting for him at Clemson.

>Anyone else here would’ve shamed me. *Selfish bastard*, my dad had shouted at me through the streaked plexiglass at the police station downtown. *This is the last thing I wanted out of you.*

>But not Lucas. He just gave me an awkward smile, like we were high school buddies exchanging stories about why we got detention.

>Our room is small, with battered wood furniture and yellow fluorescent lights. The window would be grand– it’s springline, arched, like it’s meant to contain stained glass– but it’s barred from the outside by iron bars. Like I’d have the nerve to jump out of the third story, anyway.

>Lucas’ side is sparsely decorated: navy sheets, a flag that reads something misogynistic and obscene. There’s a record player on his windowsill; he has *The Beach Boys* on vinyl.

>“Why are you here?” I ask.

>It’s hard to imagine him getting a DUI. Not because he doesn’t drink– the guy looks like he was conceived at a kickback– but because he had that old money look about him, the kind of look that made cops go easy on you.

>“The dining hall closes in thirty minutes,” Lucas tells me. I take the hint.

>When I step outside, I’m met with a labyrinth of identical doors and narrow hallways. Each is lined with dark panels and red, threadbare carpet. The air is damp, almost stale, intermingled with the sharp scent of wood polish.

>As I walk, the silence presses in around me, broken only by the soft shuffle of my shoes and the occasional creak of the old building settling. A window here and there offers brief glimpses of the outside world, which currently is no more than that inky, five-o’-clock type of darkness.

>It was about the same time of day as the meeting that had damned me here. Frankly, I would’ve rather gone to jail.

>I can still feel the cold in that room, the way that cheap plastic chair pressed into my back. It’s the kind that sticks to your thighs in the summer and makes your hair stick up in the winter.

>This was the second time I’d gotten in trouble with the police. The first time, they found me smoking weed in the woods behind school. Michael still blames it on our white lighter, but we both got off with a few hundred hours of community service and a fat fine.

>I wasn’t sure this was something that would be forgotten with community service.

>My parents were sitting across from me. Dad was rubbing his hands together, his eyes darting between me and Officer Collins, the cop who’d pulled me over.

>Collins stood there, brows furrowed. For a second, I thought he might crack a joke, the same way he used to about how tall I was getting. *Tommy, you try out for basketball yet? Coach Beeson could always use another guy like you.* But he didn’t.

>“Thomas,” my dad finally muttered, rubbing his palms over his eyes.

>I cringed at the name. I was *Mijo* to him. *Tommy*, if he was angry. The only other time I’ve heard the name *Thomas*, I was also in a police station.

>“You’re going to ruin your life if you keep doing this. Do you want us to come bail you out of jail every time you decide to act like a delinquent?”

>I didn’t say anything.

>Officer Collins cleared his throat. The sound was too sharp, too loud. Fake. “You’re lucky it wasn’t worse,” he said. “If you had been going a little faster, had a little more to drink–”

>He cut himself off, realizing that the image of me actually killing someone wasn’t something my dad needed to hear. Instead, he slid a manila folder across the table. “This is your court order.”

>“You need help, Tommy,” my mom managed in between sobs, her voice thin and fragile. Her lips pressed together. “You’re not the same. You’ve changed. Ever since you met that boy Michael…”

>“Me and Micheal aren’t friends anymore, mom,” I growled, trying to defend myself, though I’m not sure how it actually helps.

>I wanted to say something in my defense. I wanted to go home, punch a hole through my mattress. I imagined being able to stop time. First, to run away from this mess. Then, maybe, once I’ve reached Mexico or the Maldives or Bora Bora, I would just leave it frozen forever and spend the rest of my days lounging in a hammock and drinking Mai Tais.

>Instead, I just stared at the folder in front of me. I zone out. The edges blur, blending in with the table. In and out of focus. In, out. In, out.

>“Because Tommy is still a minor, they’re willing to let him go to rehab instead of jail. There’s this place called Wilderbrook about an hour away. Think of it as a sort of therapeutic boarding school. The details are in here,” Collins taps the folder.

>“I’ll give you three a moment to discuss the possibility. He’ll still have to appear in court, but this would keep the DUI off his permanent record.” Collins nodded at my dad, then turned and walked out without another word.

>The door clicked shut behind him, and we were left alone in that cold room.

>Wandering through the maze of dark hallways, it was hard to forget what had happened– hard to forget where I was. This decrepit castle was nothing like the white, peeling-paint houses I drove by each night back home. There were no crumbling asphalt roads and *Jesus Saves* signs here. Each flickering scone, each faded portrait, was a permanent reminder of what I had done. Of the life I had been torn away from.

>I must have taken the wrong staircase at some point, because I find myself standing on a walkway overlooking an oratory.

>I bend over the wooden railing, peering into the candle-lit expanse below. Shadows flicker on the walls, curling into forgotten corners where the light doesn’t reach. The air is thick with the smell of mildew and incense– sickly sweet, almost like rotten magnolias. The pews themselves are empty, most crumbling in small piles in the aisles.

>Empty, except for one. In the darkness, a figure moves. It’s half-formed, like smoke swirling in the dim light, or my mind playing tricks, making shadows dance where none should. It does not face the altar, nor the cross that beckons from the far end of the room.

>No, it’s sitting backwards in the pew. It’s facing *me*.

>It calls me by something more than name, something ancient and impossible to comprehend. *Hallelujah*, it cries into the darkness. Hoarse, broken. Begging. As if trying to summon me into existence.

>The words it speaks are not those of this world. Each syllable carries the weight of forgotten realms, the promise of forbidden knowledge. The sickly sweet scent of incense thickens, serpentine, heavy and coiling in the air. There is something almost regal about it, this prayer. It’s like a coronation of shadows, and I am the one slated for the throne.

>I know it is here for me. It knows this, too. Knows I could shape it as I please, a servant bound by my will. I could make it real, make it whole. The mere thought makes my pulse quicken.

>I could undo the mess I was in and go back to a better life. There wouldn’t be any DUI, any boarding school. And it would be different. I could do as I pleased. Sip Mai Tais in Bora Bora while another version of me became the family’s basketball star. I could have control over the fabric of reality itself.

>The figure remains bent, but I can feel it waiting for me. Waiting for me to take the crown that has already begun to form in the shadows, for the throne that sits before me, just out of reach. All I have to do is accept.

>I step closer to the railing, my breath shallow. The figure raises its head, eyes burning like ancient embers. A swirl of shadows, a multitude of faces. All pained, hoping, begging, for me to come forward.

>A voice jolts me out of my trance. I spin around to face it, but there is no more servant. There’s no more throne, no more figure, no more coronation. It’s just a doe-eyed girl. Another student.

>She wraps a strand of hair around her finger and twirls it as she examines me– it’s thick, black, and most certainly dyed. She’s wearing this repulsive gray zip-up that looks like something my uncle would buy me from Mossy Oak.

>Yes, she looks like she belongs here.

>“Lost?” she blinks up at me, standing far too close for comfort.

>“Yeah,” I reply, dumbly, still reeling from the smell of incense.

>She steps aside, revealing a spiral staircase that spirals down into the darkness. “If you’re hungry for dinner, the dining hall’s this way. You’ve got ten minutes.”

>“What’s going on?” The question is out of my mouth before I can gauge whether or not I should even ask.

>Her gaze flickers briefly toward the oratory below, and then back at me. Then she just giggles. It’s short, awkward. Forced. “I’m not sure what you’re talking about.”

>Before I can open my mouth to reply, she shoves her hands into the pockets of her jacket and strides past me. “Go on. You won’t want to miss dinner.”

That's the end of the first entry, and they only get worse from here.

I swear I’ve started feeling strange after reading the journal. Every time I leave work, I feel like I’m being followed. Like someone’s standing just behind me, watching. I can hear whispers when no one’s around. It’s like whatever Tommy wrote about is somehow pulling me in.

By posting this, I'm hoping to get to the bottom of it. But honestly, I'm not sure if I want to.

So please tell me: does anyone know about Wilderbrook?
