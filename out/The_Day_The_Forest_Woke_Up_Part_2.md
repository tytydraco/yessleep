&#x200B;

The first thing that registered as I finally regained consciousness some time later was a steady beeping, emanating from behind me. I cracked an eye open and immediately regretted it, the bright white lighting in the room making my head spin. I groaned and tried to sit up, only to gasp in pain and fall right back onto the bed. “Wait, bed? The last thing I remember is running from… something…” I thought slowly, my brain feeling like mush. “Mom was there…” my eyes suddenly shot open, grogginess forgotten as I struggled to try and sit up again. “MOM!” I yelled instinctively, terrifying scenarios involving my mother running from the beast in the woods flooding my mind.

Suddenly, a hand gripped my arm tightly. I let out a sigh of relief as I saw my mother’s concerned face just inches away from my own. “I’m right here, I’m right here” she murmured, gently easing me back into the soft pillows behind me. “I… I’m glad you’re here” I sighed quietly, unsure how to explain my outburst. She seemed to be on the verge of asking, but she seemed to think better of it as a nurse walked through the open door.

“I see someone’s awake!” The nurse said cheerfully, smiling as she walked over. They began taking my vitals as I looked back over at my mother. She looked worried, but seemed to be trying to appear stoic and put together. I knew her better than that, of course, and recognized how freaked out she actually was. I also knew I was going to have a hell of a lot of explaining to do when we were alone again.

I sighed, letting my head fall back onto the pillows. I had tuned out the nurse’s small talk, but I snapped back to attention when I heard her say, “It’s very strange, I would expect someone who was lost in the woods for two weeks to be in much worse shape than you’re currently in.” She shrugged and moved her stethoscope to better listen to my heartbeat, occasionally asking me to take a deep breath.

“Hang on, what do you mean two weeks? I was gone for like two hours, max” I objected, confusion obvious on my face. My mother crossed her arms, a strange look flickering across her face for just a moment, before it cleared once again. The nurse gave my mother a pointed look, and began packing her equipment away. “Seems you two have a bit of catching up to do. I’ll be coming in to check on him periodically now that he’s awake. Use the call button if you need anything” She added, before strolling away.

“Two weeks?” I asked quietly, looking up at my mother, searching her face for answers. “It only felt like hours, there’s no way I was gone for that long!” I protested, shaking my head lightly. She looked down at me with a small frown, sighing. “On move in day…” She began, “We had been so busy unpacking that we didn’t notice you were gone until it got dark out. That was when we started calling for you, looking around the house to see if you had decided to hide out somewhere. We tried your phone too, of course, but couldn’t get through.” She looked away and surreptitiously wiped a tear away before continuing.

“Once we realized you weren’t in the house, we started to look around the property, calling your name and running around like a couple of crazy idiots” She laughed softly, her eyes glassy as she recalled the memory. “When we still couldn’t find you, we knew something was wrong. We couldn’t do much in the dark anyway, so we called the police and reported you missing.” She continued. “They sent a couple of deputies that same night to take our statements, but there wasn’t much to be done in the dark.

The deputies weren’t very helpful when they came by again that morning but we made do, and by the end of the day we had managed to search every inch of the property with no sign of you. We started up where we had left off and began combing through the rest of the property and heading into the trees”. She paused and looked down. “The police assumed that you had run off, they said it was because you were unhappy about the move; they said they had seen this before.” She shrugged and continued on.

“Your father and I were unconvinced. I specifically remembered watching you walk into the trees, and I just knew that that was where you were, somewhere. Eventually word got out and we had volunteers showing up, offering to help us search the woods. We kept at it, searching day in and day out for as long as the light allowed. We had… nearly lost hope when we finally found you…” She trailed off, her voice barely louder than a whisper as her eyes filled with tears. She wiped her eyes and let out a breath, shaking her head. “I’m just glad you’re back, is all” She chuckled, smiling sadly.

I looked up at my mother, noting the tired look in her eyes and the disheveled state of her hair and clothes. “I don’t know what happened… I was just exploring for a bit, looking around in the trees, and then the birds went crazy, and I just took off, I started running and… I ended up lost.” I shrugged apologetically. “I stopped near a creek to get my bearings and got the strangest feeling, as if there was something out there watching.” I shuddered at the memory, even now unsettled by the way it had felt. “Anyway. I decided to head back the way I came, and ended up eventually finding the trail I had been following again.” I continued, before being cut off by my mother. “You left the trail?” She asked sharply, her features serious. “Well, yeah. I thought I saw something in the bushes, but it was just a rock.” I replied, unsettled. She paled, but she recovered quickly, putting her mask back in place. “And then?” She asked, prompting me to continue.

“I followed the trail back in the general direction of the trail. I was fine initially, but then something big started chasing me.” I said, keeping the red eyes and strange behavior the beast had exhibited to myself. “Naturally, that's when I ran, as fast as I could, and finally managed to get out of the trees. Just as I did though, I felt…” my words died in my throat as I twisted around, reaching over my shoulder in an attempt to feel for the wound on my back. My breath caught as I felt thick bandages covering the upper part of my back. “You lost a lot of blood.” My mother said quietly. “It was lucky we found you when we did, otherwise you likely would have bled out.” She added. “The police are saying that it was a bear, but there was nothing nearby, no evidence of bears in the area.” She looked away, staring out into the hallway.

I glanced over at the window, and started violently when I saw two glowing red orbs, suspended just outside the glass. I rubbed my eyes and looked again, my heart pounding in my chest as the machines beeped warnings behind me. Nothing. There was nothing there. “What? What is it?” My mother cried, following my gaze. I shook my head and kept quiet, looking down at my hands, which were trembling slightly in my lap. “I thought I saw… never mind.” I sighed, shaking my head.

My mother looked like she wanted to press me for more information, but said nothing. “Is there anything to eat? I’m starving, " I said, trying to break the tension. “Yeah, of course. I’ll go find something for you in the cafeteria”. She said, heading to the door. She stopped and looked back at me, a worried look on her face. “Be right back” She called, before leaving. I sighed and dropped my facade, glaring at the window again, as if daring the apparition to appear again. “Must be going crazy,” I muttered to myself. My mother returned a bit later and wordlessly handed me a tray laden with a sandwich, fresh fruit, and a pudding cup. “Yum!” I chimed, immediately digging in. After demolishing the food, I sighed in contentment, suddenly feeling groggy and tired again. “I think I’ll take a nap” I yawned, rolling over and almost instantly falling asleep.

The next day, I was seen by the doctor, the same one who examined my wound initially, it seemed. They replaced my bandages, commenting on how well the wound was mending itself. “Very curious, really” He said, before giving me a once over, checking all my vitals and deciding that I was free to go home. I had already gotten tired of the fluorescent lighting and the over reflective floor, so naturally I was glad to be leaving. I was even more glad to finally be getting out of the stupid hospital gown I had woken up in and into the change of clothes my mother had brought me.

I breathed a sigh of relief as I walked through the front doors of the hospital, taking in the sunshine and the breeze with a smile on my face. I let my mother lead me away from the sprawling four story building and towards the car without a second thought, ecstatic to be heading home. I looked around and recognized the area; I had seen all of this through my window. On a whim, I glanced back at the building, wondering if I could identify which room was mine. A sense of dread flooded through me as I looked up at the windows facing me and noticed what looked like claw marks gauged into the brick on either side of the window. I rushed to get into the car, looking down at my hands and doing my best to stop them from shaking, my mind reeling as I remembered the eyes from last night. I had assumed it was a hallucination at the time. After all, there was no way that anything could climb a completely sheer wall all the way up to the fourth floor window, right?

A few hours and a silent, tense car ride later and I was finally alone in my room, still in shambles and with half unpacked boxes everywhere. I sighed and flopped down on my bed, thinking about the last few days. I couldn’t believe what everyone was saying, about how I had been gone for two whole weeks. I know that I would have noticed if fourteen days and nights had passed in the woods, but everyone around me seemed convinced. Maybe it was some kind of group delusion, or something. I sighed and shrugged it off. At least it was over.

Suddenly I heard the door open down the hall, and unfamiliar voices filtered through my door. I surreptitiously opened the door and looked down the hall to see two cops standing there, talking to my mother. “Figured you would want this back, now that he’s finally back” One of them said. “We’ve got no more need for evidence now that the case is closed,” the other one added. They handed her a box, which my mother promptly placed on the dining table before walking them out and heading back into the kitchen.

Gripped by morbid curiosity, I walked down the hall and peeked into the unassuming cardboard box. Inside was everything I had on me the night I came out of the woods, all individually sealed in evidence bags. I reached down and picked up the bags containing my shirt and jeans, examining the clothes closely. My shirt, of course, had been torn to shreds in the back, whereas my jeans were intact but bloodstained. A thought came to me, and I felt around until I noticed a hard lump in the pocket of my jeans through the bag. I opened the evidence bag and reached into the pocket, pulling out the stone I had found in the forest.

Now that I could see it better, I noticed that the stone was strangely smooth, as if it had been polished. It was jet black and surprisingly heavy for its size. Its reflective surface was mesmerizing, my distorted reflection rippling as I moved the stone back and forth to examine it better. I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the stone. It felt like a vortex, pulling my gaze to it and inexorably drawing my attention.

I jumped as I felt my father’s hand on my shoulder, and quickly slipped the rock into my pocket as I turned to face him. “I see they brought your stuff back” He said, looking over at the box on the table. “The police called earlier and said they would be stopping by, slipped my mind completely.” He continued, before meeting my gaze. The corners of his lips twitched into a small half smile as he looked me over. “I’m glad you’re back. Good to see that you’re up and walking around, too. It's good to see you’re feeling better.” He finished, clearing his throat. “Anyway, your mom says that dinner’s almost ready. Clear this stuff off so I can set the table, would you son?” He asked. “Sure thing dad” I responded, gripping the box and heading back to my room.

Dinner was uneventful, mainly small talk and expressions of relief and gratitude about my safe return. I spoke quietly and as little as I could, still preoccupied about what I had seen at the hospital. There had to be some explanation, that’s what I told myself, some other reason for the marks on the wall. There was no way it was… whatever the thing in the woods was. There was no way. But then I thought back to the eyes again and my confidence wavered. I’ll admit, I was rattled, to say the least. I was suddenly torn from my thoughts when my mother spoke up. “Did you hear that?” She asked, listening intently.

My father and I stilled, listening as well, and suddenly a solid thump was heard. Then another, and another, and another. My father stood and flicked the curtain to the side, looking out the window for anything suspicious. “Nothing,” He said. “It’s probably hail. I heard that it’s common in the area, and I saw on the news that there was supposed to be a cold front coming in” He shrugged dismissively, closing the curtain and taking his seat again.

I excused myself and made my way back to my room. It had been one day since I woke up and was already tired of the constant “thank god you’re back” and “you must have been so scared” comments. I rolled my eyes and sighed. With trepidation, I looked over at the dark window, half expecting to see those demonic red eyes staring back at me. Nothing. I could, however, still hear a constant, rhythmic thumping from outside. I paid little attention to it as I got ready for bed, shutting the lights off before slipping under the covers and falling asleep in minutes.
