My daughter has always rubbed me the wrong way, I'm sorry to say but she really does creep me out and always has. I swear to god this kid is a psychopath. I've never been able to bond with her. Since the day she was born her eyes had no glimmer, her smile didn't exist, her laugh never came out. John always made excuses. "Shes just slower than other kids, give it time luce." I knew deep down he felt it too. He hated her too. Hate is a strong word but giving something 100% of your love, attention and devotion with no response can make you angry. And having to keep it up so people don't put the blame on you if your kid turns out bad is equally as frustrating.
We never took it out on her though, we were good parents to this, thing.

Julie is 17 now, she has brown eyes and beautiful long brown hair, she dresses in tomboyish type clothing . My hope for her being a loving kid faded a long time ago. We somehow managed a normalish mother daughter relationship though, thanks to my patience and acting like everything is normal. We genuinely had a normal boring life and she caused no issues, none whatsoever, which scared me sort of. I knew someday something would come up and that triggered my anxiety like nothing else. 

I was doing something in the kitchen one day, forgot what it was, when Julie came in and asked for something. She had never ever wanted anything in her life. It was a big ask. "do you think I could have a campervan in the back garden?" She said with her usual flat tone, widened eyes, not an impolite but neither polite way of asking. 

"What on earth would you need that for!" I said with a huge smile on my face in my nicest tone of voice, I even added a little giggle on the end, it could of been my only chance to have a normal lovely conversation with my daughter. She stared back at me, sending chills down my spine. I knew she wanted one desperately I could feel it. Her black eyes came more as a warning rather than that usual puppy dog "please mum!" Look.  

"I'll talk to your dad Jules, I-i say yes though." I said rather worryingly, I'd never had to say no to her before so god knows what that reaction would be. I talked to John about it when he came home from work, and rather than asking questions he was looking through campervan listings before the words even exited my mouth. He wanted her out of the house. 

Julie's campervan was private. so very private. I had never seen the inside. John did when he bought it but as soon as she entered it was hers and nobody was allowed inside. Julie had this boyfriend, Tommy, that only came to visit a few times. He was a pretty messed up kid (but lovely enough) so that explains why he would want a relationship with whatever I birthed. She took advantage of him for sure. He was like her footstool. It was entertaining to see her be something though, even if it was a massive bitch. I worried for him at times and I should of ended it as soon as he entered our home. I just finally got to see my daughter do something except go onto her computer, sleep and stare into the abyss. Tommy came more often when Julie got her campervan and they would spend days and even a couple weeks at a time in there. I didn't ask questions. I was just happy the energy in the house didn't feel so heavy and controlling. 

I was getting quite bored in the house so I adopted this lovely little angel of a cat called Nala, she was the love of my life. So loving and so affectionate. Unfortunately Nala got out and came back pregnant. After she had her litter we neutered her straight away. I secretly loved it though, all these little angels giving me so much love and needing my attention 24/7 made my heart full. I was the happiest I had been in years, I was a better wife and the fact that my daughter was a complete weirdo didn't bother me anymore. 

I woke up around 6am one morning with a horrible gut feeling, I layed there for a couple minutes until I couldn't shake the feeling anymore. I went downstairs to find all 6 of the litter missing. "I left the door open" I thought. And that was the conclusion I came to. I was heartbroken and beat myself up for days knowing that a fox had eaten them all. Nala came back a day later to my relief but she didn't come near me. She didn't eat for a couple days either. I felt so guilty, it was my fault for leaving the door open. I did actually go to therapy for this which sounds silly but fuck I had never felt so heartbroken in my life. My husband was cheating on me at this point so the kittens were my distraction.

I'm not joking when I tell you this happened 3 more times. Hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits. I always had to get them a friend or two. I had somehow always left the door wide open. I started medication to help me focus and be more attentive, my heart hurt everything hurt and the guilt was eating me alive. Why was this happening to me? The feeling of going insane is not one I'd wish on anyone. 

My beautiful thing of a daughter came in with quite a cheery demeanor one morning and talked to me about a trip her and Tommy were taking. I barely listened to a word she said and focused on the glimmer in her eyes. Oh my god, it's happened, she's normal. She just needed her own space all this time? In that moment everything started to feel normal. It felt peaceful. 
"So is that okay then?" She said going back to her usual flat tone knowing I wasn't really listening. "Yes darling of course, did you want me to clean your campervan for you or do anything with it while your gone?" She stared at me for about three seconds, turned her head to look at the campervan through our kitchen window, I felt sick, what was wrong with the question I just asked? She turned back to me and said "I clean it every weekend" phew. My heart stopped beating. I thought she was going to snap that time. 

When she left it's like a curse had been lifted on the house, I even danced a little bit while listening to boy george. I LOVE BOY GEORGE. Life was good it felt normal. But then I had a wave of melancholy. It only felt normal when my only daughter had gone. 
There is something so very wrong with this kid and curiosity had nearly gotten the best of me over the years, but deep down I knew if I snooped there was no going back. This time I did snoop. 

Red flag No.1 about this campervan. It was chained up with a lock? Why on earth would she need to do that. She knows we don't snoop, well, this is the one and only time I would. 

I had my husband Jimmy the lock and hurrah! We had access! John scurried off to his office. "There's nothing in there, she took her laptop with her, there's no point Lucy". He was scared, weak, pathetic. Why did I marry this guy? Ugh. As I walked in the smell of bleach was so overwhelming I nearly fainted. I loved the smell of bleach though, she was like me, used way too much. Her campervan was spotless and absolutely gorgeous. I was so proud of her making her little home. Not even a spoon in the sink. Her computer and camcorder layed next to her little sofa that turned into a bed. "I thought she took it with her?" I thought. My heart started beating as I got closer to her laptop. My gut was screaming at me. For what I don't know. It took me five minutes to open the laptop, I sat and stared at it that whole time. Was it because I was invading her privacy? Am I doing the right thing? Fuck it. 

She had no password on her computer, just a face ID lock. "For fuck sake" I thought. I threw my hair up into a pony tail, took my glasses off, threw on a hoodie and what do you know. IT WORKED. I passed as my 17 year old? Thanks! Made me smirk a little. Thank god for my strong genes?

Her desktop was as immaculate as her campervan. Everything strictly organised in alphabetical order and no clutter it seemed. I clicked onto files and a password protected file came up. "JuliesFiles". My heart broke, my daughter was making porn with her boyfriend? I was so upset. I didn't want to go any further but you can't make assumptions even if you really think you know what's going on. You'd never guess what the password was. QWERTYXYZ. It was my tenth guess, I had seen her drag her finger across her keyboard before and remembered that's what her father did to hide his password. I'm so fucking pleased with myself at this point, who would of guessed that? Apparently me. Twice. Seriously no point in hiding anything from me. 

I would prepare yourself for what im about to tell you. My whole world came crashing down. I threw up multiple times. Just hold on. I'm so sorry 


July 17th: 12:12am 

Julie is shown recording Tommy sat on the sofabed staring at the ground. It showed his face for a good two minutes. He didn't look happy, he looked terrified. I heard her giggle. "She laughs?" I thought. The camera panned down to a white paint bucket on the floor. "Go on then Tommy, it's good for you." What on earth was I watching? "Please Julie" he said looking up with tears in his eyes. He reached his hand in the bucket and put whatever it was in his mouth. She erupted in laughter. It was terrifying. What on earth was she making him eat? It looked black, chunky and it was dripping everywhere. the video cut. 

Deep breath


July 20th: 4am

Julie is recording Tommy once again. This time he was holding a white sheet that had a bundle of something moving inside. She pans the camera round and my cat Nala is caged into her travel cage. I was so confused. "Tommy has a trick he wants to show you nala" she said giggling. That giggle seriously sent chills down my spine. "Do it Tommy! Do it! Or Ill tell everyone what my dad did to you" I paused the video. What? What am I supposed to be watching right now? Is this real life? What was the comment about my husband about? I unpaused.
"Open it Tommy show everyone what you have first!" Tommy opened the enclosed white sheet, my kittens, my kittens were inside. My heart stopped. What the fuck was this going to be?. I could hear Nala screaming for her babies. Tommy tied the sheet with an elastic band. He was ordered to put his boots on and stamp on the bundle until nothing moved. He did just that. Nala screamed, the kittens screamed, Tommy cried and Julie erupted in laughter once more as the sheet turned red on the outside. Tommy was then ordered to put the kittens in a blender she had bought a month previous to make smoothies. He blended them up and was forced to drink every last drop. I had thrown up twice at this point. She let Nala out of her cage. I had never seen a heartbroken cat before. 


I didn't know if I could watch anymore. Just one more I said. I ended up watching the rest of them. All of my animals met the same fate, except for my hamsters which Tommy was forced to eat alive. What did she have against him that made him do this? What was the comment about my husband about? The last video gave me all the answers. 


July 24th: 5am

"Julie, Julie is it on?" I heard her father whisper. "Yes it's fucking on dad please shut up." I had never heard her speak to her father like that before. This video was the worst of them all. She recorded herself kissing her father on the lips, and then ordered him to go over to where Tommy slept. She was naked in this video, so was her father. They had just slept together. I sat there in rage and confusion and disgust ready to call the police. That was her dad. The man who raised her. I wanted to die. I watched as he sodomized her boyfriend as he wept in his most likely drugged up state. He didn't look conscious or awake enough to fight back. He was forced to say all sorts of heart wrenching things. "more daddy" "I love you daddy" "thankyou daddy". I couldn't take any more of this but I couldn't stop watching it. How was this my life? What the fuck happened to get to this point? The video ended with her father spraying himself all over Tommy, that poor child. 

My mind was blank. I was broken. I put everything back where it was. Chained up the campervan and poured myself a glass of talisker. I sparked up a cigarette and just stared out the window. I couldn't tell you at this precise moment as to what I was thinking. Probably nothing. I waited for Julie to come home which was in the next two days. It was the longest two days of my life. I carried on life as normal as possible. Her father didn't leave his study much anyway so I didn't have to keep on a happy face for him.  

Julie arrived home, her usual boring self. Tommy with her with his usual politeness and heavy dark circles. I had announced to everyone I was making a meal for everyone that night. I could feel her untrust the second the words left my mouth. She obliged and Tommy stayed for dinner also. 

Julie and John's plates were blue, mine and Tommy's were white. I had put in a heavy dose of promethazine in Julie and John's food and made sure if was hidden. I didn't ask, but instead ordered everyone to sit and watch a movie after dinner, I had never done this before and I could tell everyone at the table seemed unnerved. This was non negotiable. I had been taken advantage of, I let a poor mentally unstable boy be taken advantage of in the most deplorable way in my own home. Something had to be done. 

"Anybody want a cup of tea? Tommy would you like a cup of tea?" Julie stared at me like she usually does, John ignored me, and Tommy looked up with his lovely blue eyes and said "no thankyou Lucy" in his shaken quiet tone of voice.  John and Julie had started to fall asleep at this point. When they fully did I told Tommy to go wait in Julie's room because I needed to talk to him. He was an obedient boy and did as he was told. I boiled the kettle and poured a bag of sugar inside. I stood behind the sofa for a few minutes thinking about everything they had done, everything they did to me. And I did it. I poured the mixture onto their faces. The screams were joyous. I loved every second of it. I don't regret it. I took a knife and stabbed the both of them in the most painful places imaginable. It was incredible. Tommy was put into a mental institution after the videos had been discovered. I wish I just called the police on Julie and John sometimes because I could've been there for Tommy. These monsters needed to die 

I love prison. I love my freedom, I love being able to wake up and be needed somewhere, I love the hour a day I get outside. I love my life now. I have to go because your not really allowed phones in prison.
My roommates name is Tommy too, Tommy taffy, such a strange but fun last name. he came about after a guard had gotten me pregnant.  Why they would let a male in a female prison is beyond me but I've never asked questions. He is quite strange but I like him, he said he knew Julie for five years and had to move on? People are crazy in here! Can't believe a word they say. But he said he was going to help me parent my kid which is so sweet! I hope whoever adopts my child has someone like Tommy around. Sweet, friendly and caring.

- Julie
