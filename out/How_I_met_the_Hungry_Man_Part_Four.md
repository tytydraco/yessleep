[The house we stopped at was old](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nxrpj4/how_i_met_the_hungry_man_part_two/). Weeds grew from between the stones that made the walls, the low glow of a fire fluttered from the gap in the roof.

Grandad held the scalpel tightly. "Open the door". I turned to my grandfather. "We are going to step out of the car Jamie" his arm trembled "but don't you look at me you hear? DO NOT LOOK AT ME"

I turned from him and opened the car. When were both outside, facing the stone cottage he spoke once more: "See that house Kiddo? We are going to walk right up to that door, and it's all going to be okay"

"Grandad" I watched the gentle glow of the fire. "I'm going near there"

"GO" he roared.

I turned and faced him "no"

The old man let his hand fall for a second, before raising his hand and walking toward the the verge where the grass met the gravel, stopping before his feet could touch the grass. At the top of his lungs he shouted "Tá ocras ort. Tabharfaidh mé bia duit"

The fire extinguished, and the noise of the engine disappeared, a terrible quiet fell upon the dark grasslands. My eyes clung to the low doorway of the decrepit old cottage. Fingers, long and spider like hunched their way around the doorframe, and, anchoring there appeared to be under immense strain as a tall figure, covered in moonlit rags emerged. When the thing stood to its full height, which seemed taller than the cottage itself, its head seemed too large for its thin neck. The way its legs were bent, gave the impression of old wounds that never healed.

I seen Grandad's mouth move, as if repeating what he had said, yet I heard nothing. The being did not move. It's lack of movement appeared to anger Grandad, because he turned to me, and grabbed me. In my stupefied state, it took me a moment to realise he was dragging me nearer to the grass. The stories he had told me rushed back to me and, without thinking, I whipped by hand from him, and instead pushed him onto the grass. It was only when he hit the grass did the noise of the world return.

The creature walked quickly, its bent limbs and bobbling head swinging and operating in maddening motions as it approached my grandfather. The grass had firstly gripped his outstretched hand, binding themselves quickly and vastly around his fingers. As the the ragged creature approached the grass grew faster, the long grass growing high before falling over my Grandfather and dragging his crouched figure tightly to the ground. His screams were muffled by the green blades that entered his mouth. Finally the tall figure reached my Grandad, and stretching its impossibly thin arm downward, I watched as its barely covered muscles tightened to lift the arm of my grandfather closer to its head which it leaned downward. The grass parted willingly from the arm, continuing to tighten around the remaining, thrashing outline of the old man. The figure bit into the pale arm, and I watched in horror as blood seeped thin scarlet pillars toward the grass. Lifting its head to chew, its gaunt jaws fattening with each bite. Chewing for but a moment more, it raised its free arm upward and into its own gnashing maw, producing from it, between forefinger and thumb, the mangled meat. The very same arm lowered, and casting the rags to expose its stomach, I watched as where its starved abdomen should have been, instead was hundreds of curling, pointing, wagging fingers. Dirty, cracked nails glinted like countless grinding teeth in the moonlight, each frantically searching for the meat that it sought to drag toward whatever lay at its horrid epicenter. Yet I watched, the noise of it all sounded like drums, like maddening yet enticing drums, the pained excitements of my suffocating grandfather, the gnashing teeth, the devouring fingers. I felt entranced.

When the figure had been fed, and had returned to its cottage, I fancied it looked more human, as if satisfaction had returned it to a form it once held. Beneath the grass, the shape seemed almost gelatinous, as if it were still be digested.

"So kiddo" I looked at my son with a smile "the once was frightened man who wanted nothing more but to make his family proud. So he made a deal with a very hungry man, who the frightened man promised to feed. The hungry man agreed that he'd make sure that his family would forever be proud of him, and happy together. For years, the frightened man enjoyed this deal, but as his mum and dad got older, he realised that his was going to be very lonely when his mum and dad had gone. So he made another deal with the hungry man, and the hungry man promised that the lonely man would never ever be lonely again. When the lonely man's parents were gone, the lonely man had a wife, and had two lovely sons with who he could play with every single day"

Niall looked up at me, his eyes awash with wonderment and amazement, beside him his younger brother crawled closer.

"Then" I continued "the lonely man wasn't so lonely, and for the first time was very happy. But when the lonely man forgot to feed the hungry man" I paused a moment to observe Theo's loud, somewhat laboured breathing "the hungry man got angry. This made the lonely man very very worried" I booped Niall's nose playfully "So the worried man made once last deal with the hungry man"

"What was that daddy?" asked Niall, his almond-brown eyes wide and curious.

I twisted my wedding ring. "We'll ask Mam when she gets back from her shift at the hospital.
