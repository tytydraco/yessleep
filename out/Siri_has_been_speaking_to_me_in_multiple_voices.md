When I’m around people, my Siri sounds totally fine and normal, but when I’m in any situation where nobody would be able to overhear it, Siri speaks to me in a deeper, more-tired, robotic voice. She still says what Siri would normally say, I think, but it’s in that weird voice.

I know my phone’s speakers aren’t going out because they play every video and song I put on just fine. It’s only when I’m alone and using Siri. And even then, she doesn’t ALWAYS talk in that weird voice, but it’s often enough to not just be a fluke at this point.

I’d write it off as a software error or something going wrong with my old phone (and I have a phone case, but I HAVE dropped the phone quite a bit), if it weren’t for the fact that since it’s been happening I’ve been hearing more noises in my house, and strange things like lights turning themselves on BY THE SWITCH (which thankfully happened just once I believe) have been happening.

Like wtf?? I was alone for 5 days recently and this happened in my laundry room, nearest the garage. Not to mention I keep seeing this damned white fabric sheet or something waving at me from just around my bedroom corner, and always out of the corner of my eye.

It got me thinking maybe I have some intruder living in my house, and they’re waving something to see if I’m paying attention so they can sneak around if I’m not, lmao. But that can’t be it. I walked straight out of my room towards the fabric thing once—straight into an open room with nothing to hide behind and nowhere to go fast enough without making noise—only took me like ~1.5 seconds to get there, and nothing was there.

One night when I came home, a skittering was coming from somewhere around a stack of boxes in my garage. It sounded like it was clicking its tiny little feet or tongue or something, but subtle. Kind of quiet. Just enough to make me curious yet cautious, but not enough to send me jumping or sprinting away. I thought it could be like a big centipede or scorpion making clacking noises as it crawled, but I don’t think centipedes or scorpions actually get that big here, and it would have had to at least been rodent-sized the way it sounded like it was brushing against boxes and moving papers.

Unfortunately, fear of the unknown said “get tf out of there” rather than investigate, so I walked backwards from the boxes, opened the door to my house, and closed it, all while making sure nothing skittered in (and of course I locked the door as well).

On another night, a persistent humming started up. And look, I can dismiss knocking and clicking as pipes in the walls or the house settling, even when said knocks and clicks get louder and more frequent until they’re right over my bed (like they absolutely did one night), but when it’s a hum?? And not a sustained hum either, but a hum like the beat of a drum. No melody to it, and always coming in the same intervals.

At first I thought “Huh, maybe one of my pipes is ringing? Or something is beeping?” And I sat up expecting to be able to hear it more clearly, but maybe it was the ruffle of my sheets creating some noise pollution or the thump of my quickening heartbeat distracting me, but the noise seemed to get a bit quieter and recede somewhere in the the ceiling beyond my closet—sort of toward the garage as well—(only to of course get louder when I laid back down, and seemingly only subsiding at some unknown interval after I finally fell asleep despite it).

Now, I’m not saying any of this is substantial evidence of the paranormal. I’m not even trying to argue that any of this is beyond the norm or more than just some minor auditory and visual hallucinations on my part, but whether this is a psychological, spooky, and concerning tale about A Reddit user (me)’s recent and apparent decline in mental stability, or some actual weird spirit, Siri speaking to me in those two different voices is when all of this became more apparent to me.

So, sorry this hasn’t been a fantastical story, but it’s still strange to me nonetheless, and if anyone has any theories beyond the obvious (potential hallucinations) to share, I’d be down to hear them (or answer more questions if I can), but I also realize there’s probably not a lot to be gleaned from my mediocre recanting of past events, lol.

Uhh, also, as a PS: The whole time I’ve been writing this on my phone, the text cursor has periodically been jumping back to a previous paragraph over and over, and it was only on this second-to-last time it did it that I realized it’s been jumping back to the part where I described Siri’s second voice… so that’s pretty weird, lol. Maybe just a coincidence though.

Anyway, that’s all! Thanks for reading. :P I’ll probably post an update if anything weirder happens.
