After trying and trying for 3 months, I found a nearly perfect big and nice 3-bedroom Duplex. It is walking distance to the Beach, I was really excited about it. 

I was going to move into the Duplex with my girlfriend (GF) and it was desperately need as this would allow us to keep our dog, I had also promised to sublet a room to a close friend (S), who was in a tough place financially, but  had a good job, just horrible personal luck and needed a hand. The third bedroom would be offered to (J).

I met (J), when he booked one of my private bedrooms through Airbnb. He was nice, said he played in the NFL, was polite and smart. 

We became friends and he offered to co-sign to facilitate getting the Duplex. 

&#x200B;

Lastly a high school friend (G) offered to co-signed, just to help me get approved for the place

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the middle of the application process I realized (J) wasn't being completely honest, 

as he turned out to use a bank account that he really didn't control.

&#x200B;

He had a quick excuse and instead he shared his CashApp statements, and though his income was lot lower than what he first claimed,

we got approved and I was too happy to be too worried.

&#x200B;

People will think me stupid for this:

&#x200B;

I paid for everything, deposit, furniture, bills, amenities. To move in I spend easily over $15,000.

In exchange for (J) would pay $1800 and (S) $1567, leaving to my own rent cost about $700 directly and having the bigger room for me and (T)

&#x200B;

But after (S) first started having some troubles paying rent, suddenly (J) attitude worsen, manipulations were becoming clearer,

especially when we realized he was instigating everyone to fight with each other. 

(S) caught up his rent, but (J) then fell behind, stayed behind, and strangely would speak about it as I was culpable.

&#x200B;

I very politely asked to communicate in text for better record keeping for myself (actually due his lying) 

and he richly accused me of trying to trap him saying something he shouldn't.

He started saying to (GF), (S) and other people that I had tricked him, force him to move in,

and broke my promise to let him live in the room I airbnb in South Beach. He said he wasn't making money because of this reason,

that it was my fault he was behind rent. He started patronizing me, as in I don't understand how working really is, that I'm child-like. 

To pacify him, and with  great hope he starts making money, he pays his late rent and "HAKUNA MATATA" -I said he could go to South Beach

for a few nights in  two weeks when there is an opening.

He starts talking and messaging me that he is moving there to my surprise.

Well he packs all his stuff from my Duplex and goes to my Airbnb. 

Then he left my place in South beach and went somewhere else, I do not know where.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

By now I had invited a friend to stay in my duplex, the bedroom (J) had vacated.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the 25th of November (rent is due in the 1st), I contact him about finishing paying me back: $300 from Nov. rent, 

$20 he had kept from me, and another $400 he owed the third roommate (S), that wasn't in the lease, yet I cared for my friend (S).

&#x200B;

He doesn't pay a penny, insults, blames me, I tell him to please stay gone then, I would forgive and pay his debts here. 

He had taken all his stuff already from my home and I had a friend sleeping here occupying th bedroom he moved out of. 

If he left anything in my other place in South Beach he could contact (R) that lives there to pick his stuff

&#x200B;

If he returned to my duplex, I wouldn't stop him entering as I knew legally I couldn't. But I have already another friend sleeping in the room and he would have to kick them out legally.

&#x200B;

He responded saying I am illegally evicting him over over $20 dollars, but he be happy to stay gone, if I pay him $2,588 otherwise,

he would return and make my life hell, among the written threats, he would enter the house and change the locks, lose everything, get me evicted from south beach, evicted from my home, loose my income

&#x200B;

also in phone calls he threaten physically a lot including to attack me while sleeping.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I said I won't be subject to blackmail and we stop having contact.

&#x200B;

I didn't hear of him again, but I saw him drive by a couple times and look at the house driving by or in a park park car. 

he would leave when he knew I saw him with certainty. Happened predictably when I would turn my bedroom light on at night,

and I became visible to him.

&#x200B;

He called the police to my front door, He ask about Jai, and I had to tell the police everything about the situation, 

police told me (J) story's is completely different, but he said I could go home, I went back inside and from my bedroom window. 

I noticed Jai with luggage walking towards my house, talk to the police by the side walk a few minutes then both leave.

&#x200B;

He is now saying, he had a police escort him inside the duplex to collect his stuff, and that he was illegally evicted. 

He also reported me and the city and they send investigators for doing illegal vacation rentals in my Duplex and in South Beach.

He has emailed the landlord demanding them to evict me, so he could move in my home! Sleep in my bed, eat my food, use my TV. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Over a month later he eventually does enter through the front door during the day, and sits in my couch along with a Husky.

He essentially claims I had locked him out and to avoid troubles for myself, He will live here in my home again, he will not pay back his debts to me, 

Also would keep 1/3 of deposit and he will now get to pick which bedroom is his own, and my bathroom is now his bathroom.

&#x200B;

This day and night I was very afraid, (GF) had called the police and they said they would not get involved. 

He recorded me through hours to gather evidence to harm me somehow and I felt powerless to do anything besides sit by the stairs to my bedroom for 5 maybe 7 hours.

&#x200B;

I obtained luckily a 6 minute video that he recorded of me, when he started this recording, like many others it was secretly. 

It starts' when I was alone with him, and he said I couldn't stop him going upstairs and he was going to "his" room.

&#x200B;

I started panicking and was going up the stairs saying "don't go near me", but i was going up to lock myself in my bedroom had he come closer. He realized it, then focused the camera on me -

that's when I noticed he was recording me and that made me feel safe.

Now his plan is  to record me and paint me unhinged, since he realized I was never going to get physical.

So I vented over 5 minutes saying what I think of him, he didn't deny when I accused him of owing money too a whole lot of people and fooling them. He responded that has nothing to do with us. He finally stop recording, when he got caught off guard, as I reminded of my fear of him and his multiple threats to beat me up, he uncomfortably argues, all he said was that I deserve it, as in I deserve to be beaten up by him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Later (S) talks to him gently and we compromise on him sleeping in the couch or the bedroom downstairs, but he had to stop harassing us and his debts and rent price we would discussed tomorrow.

&#x200B;

I offered him a plate of food and he slept.

&#x200B;

He leaves next morning without saying anything. Then his lawyer messages me, and now I am told I have to pay him a settlement

Otherwise he wont leave the lease, nor anyone else could without his signature. (G) wants to sign off

He will not allow anyone to join the lease to have me help pay rent. (GF) and (S) want to sign in.

Landlord thus will be force to evict me for having (GF) and (S) live here without being added to the lease.

Also he mentions they have proof of drugs in the Duplex

(S) had the brilliant idea to make a joint in front of him while being recorded, as a flex "do your worse (J)"

&#x200B;

Landlord expects me to solve everything and I am just now seeking legal help.
