5:30 pm, when it was gradually turning to dusk, at this time, most of the customers had left “Moonlight” cafe where I was working for a living, and I would be the one who was in charge of closing the cafe. I was sitting in the chair behind Michael Conslake- one of my colleague and falling asleep on the table with an exhausted condition while cleaning the tables and chairs in the cafe. I dreamed that strange dream: I found myself staying inside a deep cave and was witnessing two supernatural entities confronting each other. One of them ws in the form of a girl who wore a white dress, and another one was an entity covered by black fog with a big pair of crimson eyes and terrifyingly sharp teeth.

Two forces from two white and black power spheres were shot at each other. From my perspective, it was just like a scene from a science-fiction movie. A white aura surrounded the girl, and the force of the black fog was getting stronger. This created a huge vibration that shook the whole cave, and everything around it was being cracked up. The space was covered with two colors: black and white.

When the force of light overwhelmed the force of darkness, I realized that the girl was at a higher advantage than that dark, evil god-like entity. I saw this god-like entity a little bit as similar to the god trapped in a magic lamp that the man named “Aladdin” found in a movie I saw when I was still a child. Suddenly, a mysterious young man with a weird brown outfit appeared out of nowhere and shouted:

"My Godness, don't stop. The real nightmare is about to come to an end. Just try a little bit more…"

"What the hell is going on here? Am I dreaming? Everything here is such a mess. Nightmare...? Did he mean that scary entity-being?”- I thought while seeing what’s happening.

Before I could understand what was happening, I saw something gradually emerging amid the tremor. It was so blurred, emerging and disappeared in a flash wherever there was a tremor. The entity covered with black fog began to laugh menacingly:

"Thanks to you, I'm about to reach my end. Hahaha..."

"No way! Impossible! How come…? So I... I’m giving him a hand to make it happen?"- The entity called “Goddess” exclaimed in fear- "No, I can never let him win."

"It is too late. Let's witness this eternal horrible nightmare coming."- The dark entity satisfyingly laughed.

"Never. I swear, I won't let you reach your purpose."- The girl shouted.

Suddenly, the girl turned her eyes to me. I realized that she was also aware of his presence. She said:

"There is only one way. No more time left. I have to use triumph already."

"Hey, did you see me? What are you going to do?"- I was very surprised and tried to hold out his hand to prevent her.

"I’m so sorry. It's all for the future of humanity. I want to say that I don't regret choosing this path."

Then Goddess recited a spell: "Maruva...- Creating the barrier". Suddenly, her body radiated a huge light, causing me to be dazzled, so I covered my eyes with his hand instinctly.

I woke up, then stood up, shouting: "Don't!", while stretching out my hands, and turning my open left palm toward Michael who was sweeping the floor. Michael was startled, jumped up, his face panicked abit, said:

“What’s wrong, Vic?”

I sweated, put his hand over his mouth, and panted, then said:

“Nothing”

“You’re scaring the shit out of me, you know.”- Michael smirked.

Suddenly, a hand grabbed my left shoulder from behind. That time I was very startled, then turned my head, and brushed that hand away with a panicked expression, I realized that it was Denvy Karatini, the owner of “Moonlight” cafe, who hired Michael and me as part-time job servants. He asked me:

"I got here after hearing your shout, Victor. Did you fall asleep and have a nightmare while cleaning? Are you alright?"

"Ah, yes. Sorry about that. I was a bit tired, so I fell asleep for a while. No worries, just leave me here to be calm for a while, sir."

“Alright, Victor. We’ve worked really hard today. You were just tired because of this, probably. Take some rest at room after work.”

“OK, Mr. Karatini. Thanks”

Michael saw my unusual face that was full of sweat, asked:

"What kind of nightmare you had then? After waking up, you looked so panicked."

Realizing that Michael's aware of part of the reason for my behavior, I wiped the sweat from my face and replied:

"Well, I had a strange dream. Fictional, extremely fantastic, these are what I can describe about it."

I looked down at both my hands, trying to remember. Michael approached and said:

"Hey, what did you dream about? Are those your old memories?"

"I’m not sure. As for that dream... how to say... it’s about a girl in white with supernatural power fought with a dark devil-like entity with supernatural power that looked very scary and evil, it’s just so crazy, man."- Victor still passionately narrated- "Both sides had two opposite conditions, one side radiated white aura, the other one was covered by black fog. They released their power to fight each other; as for their power, when one brought the power of light, another one brought the power of darkness. Then the girl talked to me while making a last move to end the fight."

It’s not just Michael who was listening to my story, but it’s a ghost-like entity behind Victor’s back was, as well. Knowing that he would never believe it’s true, I interrupted myself by saying:

“Oh, I don’t think you can believe what I just said. I’m going to say no more. Forget i…”

Michael said calmly:

“No, keep going. What did she say?”

“You truly believe me, don’t you?”

“Sure I do, Vic.”

“Alright. Then she said: ’I’m so sorry. It's all for the future of humanity. We have no choice left as of now. I want to say that I don't regret choosing this path.’"

“ …for the future of humanity?!”- Michael whispered.

Seeing Michael’s confused face, I asked:

“Hey, Mike. What’s wrong?”

“Ah, nothing. So what happened next?”- Michael said.

“I don’t know. I woke up after hearing her very last words.”

Michael looked at the ghost-like entity behind me with suspicious eyes.

Then I turned and pointed my finger to the entity behind me:

"By the way, can someone explain to me about the ghost that is haunting me?”

“That…”

“And what should we call this thing? Uhm… Elemental Card, right?”- I took a yellow origami-like thing from my pocket while talking- “OK, so ever since I received the Elemental Card, I've always seen that entity loitering around and saying confusing things. So many crazy things have been happening since I’m amnesiac condition without explanation."

Our attention was on the ghost behind me that time. Michael explained to me:

"Your confusion is totally normal. Let me explain. The yellow ghost-like entity you spoke of was the original owner of Elemental Cards, known as one of the 'Elemental Gods'. If you touch the card that belongs to a random god, you can see him through your naked eyes."

"Elemental... Gods?”

“Yeah, they’re protectors of Elemental Cards, as far as I concerned”- Michael smiled.  
I know I can’t help but asking that entity for my curiosity:

“You said that your name is Thedus before, right? I heard that I can access to your memory by the time I become this thing’s owner. So answer my question: ‘Do you know anything about what’s happened in my dream?”

That ghost in the background began to speak:

"Hey you, you may not know it, but I am one of the gods who protected humans 1000 years ago, so don’t give me orders, human.”

 “How arrogant he is. Such a pain”- I muttered with discomfort.

“I can hear what you said even when you didn’t say it loud, tho. Watch your mouth if you want to talk to us, human”- Thedus chewed me out.”  
Then I knew he’s exactly the type of guy I thought, so I changed my attitude for my sake and said:

“OK, my bad. Sorry for talking like a jerk, alright?”- “So tell us about what you know about, please.”

“I can just tell you guys one thing: the man you saw in your dream was my comrade, his name is Song.”- Thedus said- “He used to have an Elemental Card. You also have one, but it used to be mine."

"Is that it? So there is one more card existed, am I right?" - I pointed to my card while asking Thedus.

"Your conclusion is right. Another of them is in that guy’s hand."- Thedus pointed at Michael.

Michael immediately took a thing that as similar to my Elemental Card but with blue color out of his jacket and showed it to me. By the time I saw Michael’s Elemental Card, I asked Thedus:

"Got it. But can you tell me why I had such a strange dream? And the reason humanity like us were chosen to be warriors."

Thedus remained silent a few seconds, didn't know what he's thinking. And then he answered me like that:

"I don't know anything about your dream and the reason why you had such a weird dream. As for the reason why we chose humans, you will find out later. What you have to do is keep fighting and exploring the secret behind yourself."

Suddenly, my Elemental Card lighted up, and so did Michael’s. He looked at me as if he realized what it meant. Michael dropped the mop from his hand and said:

"There is a monster in the city. Through how bright our Elemental Cards are, the monster must be very close to us. We got to go now, guys."
