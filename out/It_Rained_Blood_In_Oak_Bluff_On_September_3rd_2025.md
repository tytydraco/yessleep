And it’ll happen again. And it won’t *just* be blood.

The damage to the town was immense. Reports from local officials estimated ten casualties, flood damage in over seventy percent of buildings, and hundreds of injuries ranging from pneumonia to blood-borne infections.

And I know why it happened.

This is something I’ve been keeping tight to my chest because I don’t want to face any blowback for what happened. Oak Bluff is a small town, now smaller, and word gets around *fast*. That's why I’m posting here anonymously.

Shelby had been my best friend since we were little kids. He was always quiet, maybe too quiet. He had little beady eyes that seemed to suck in all the energy of a room and give very little back. Regardless, I didn’t really have other friends, making him my closest by default. His family has always been on the struggling side, living out of an RV with his parents. I’d go over there after school all the time, since his parents didn’t have any house rules and we could run around outside anywhere in the woods nearby.

That’s why I noticed when he wasn’t at school on September 3rd. Without him, the day went by aggressively boring. After classes ended, I drove home and went to take a nap. It was always peaceful at this time of day; my mom, the only other resident of the house, was usually still on shift at the hospital.

I awoke to a faint pattering outside. Just some rain. I remembered the forecast from the morning: clear skies. I guess they get it wrong sometimes. Walking out into the kitchen, I realized I hadn’t taken out the trash yet. Better do it now before mom gets home to scold me.

Garbage bag in hand, I cautiously walked outside in the rain. Before I noticed anything else, the smell hit me like a truck. Strong and coppery, like coins were being shoveled into my nose. I could even *taste* it. Then I felt it. The few drops of rain that hit me felt thicker, harder than normal. They were warm. Much warmer than the air around me.

I looked at my outstretched palm. The rain that dripped onto it was bright red. Like paint. I tried to wipe it off, but it had already stained my skin, tinting it pink. I looked towards the driveway; it was covered in these tiny red splotches from each raindrop. I felt a tingling worry in my feet and I raced to toss the bag into the trash bin before running straight back inside.

I went straight to the bathroom and looked at myself. I was covered in tiny droplets of red dye, stuck to my clothes and skin. Some had dripped down my face, as if I had bled from my scalp. I checked myself over to make sure I wasn’t bleeding. I wasn’t.

It wasn’t long before the rain started to pick up the pace. I watched from my bedroom window as the sky turned darker grey and the downpour grew. The ground, plants, and neighboring roofs were all a bright red now. My window began to stain with the stuff, making it hard to see past the opaque liquid. I started to worry and I called my mom.

“Mom, can you talk?”

“Uh, honey, I’m on call right now. I have a patient in the delivery room. Can I call you back?”

“Is it raining there? It's raining really bad here, but it's… bright red. I–I think it might be… blood?”

“What? J–just stay inside, sweetie. I have to call you back in a bit.”

She hung up. I felt nervous. What was going on? Was this going to get worse? By this point, it was already raining more heavily than it had in a very long time, feeling more like the lashings of the edge of a hurricane than a regular storm. I tried to call Shelby. No answer. I tried again to no avail. I started to worry if he was okay. 

My eyes turned towards my car, drenched in thick blood through the window. I wondered if I could get to him. Was that a bad idea? Probably. But in that state of mind, I needed company. I grabbed my thickest jeans, waterproof boots, and raincoat. I pulled the hood over my head and rushed out the door.

It was hard to see through the air, a red fog enveloped everything. I sprinted to my car, splashing through thick, dark puddles of coagulating blood, sticking to my boots. My car windows were completely covered, and I was unable to see through them. I got in and shut the door, blood spattering onto the floor and driver’s seat.

I turned the ignition and switched on the wipers for the front and back windshield. They furiously mopped away at the impenetrable red. It was nearly useless, as more blood filled my view almost instantly after the blade wiped up and down. 

The roads were hell. The wind lashed at my car and the surroundings, blowing huge pools of blood out of the road and leaving sticky, congealed masses scattered across practically all pavement. I had to swerve around holes and dislodged plant matter while consistently turning rightwards to counteract the wind.

Though I could hardly see, what I could make out astounded me. In the town center, every building had shingles flying off. Every building was coated in thick layers of blood, a dark red paint that coated every nook and cranny imaginable. There were no people in sight. Luckily, Shelby’s house wasn’t too far off–

*Thunk!*

I hit something big and swerved, my front right tire falling off the edge of the road. I could barely make out a vaguely human-shaped figure spread flat on the ground behind me. My fingers gripped the steering wheel, pins and needles taking over all feeling. My eyes darted away from the mirror. My vision swam. Do I get out? Help them?

After some thought, I reversed onto the road and kept driving.

I entered the RV park where Shelby lived. The dirt road had transformed into a bright red bubbling sludge that was slick and difficult to drive straight on. I saw multiple RVs sinking into the mud, their pristine paint jobs permanently bloodied. 

I saw a soaking wet man on his knees on the side of the road, shouting to the sky with his hands outstretched, blood flooding his eyes and mouth. I imagined the baby my mom was delivering at that moment. I wondered if they looked the same.

Finally approaching Shelby’s RV, I stopped my car next to a large, clotting puddle to the side of the home. As soon as the car turned off, it went dark. The windows were covered. Light only came through in thin, bright red bands. I clenched my jaw, took a deep breath, and stepped into a hellscape.

The RV looked like something out of a horror movie; it was covered in these long tendrils of blood, covering all of the white outer walls from roof to ground. All the curtains were drawn shut and no light shined through. He must have lost power. A small, frothing blood river had formed below the center, flowing across the width of the RV, deepening the ground below and leaving an obstacle for me to hop over as I reached the door. 

The door itself was odd. It was hanging open, swinging at the hinges, slapping the frame of the wall repeatedly, splattering blood into the interior. Was no one home? I walked up one extended step and grabbed the railing that led to the door. I was getting pelted with blood and wanted to get in, but something made me stop right in my tracks.

A bloody, open hand was flat and motionless on the ground inside, connected to a body I couldn’t yet see. I realized a flickering, orange glow was cast upon it. My stomach dropped. I slowly peeked my head through the doorway, catching the door before it could slam shut again. 

Shelby’s dad was limp on the ground, bent at an uncomfortable angle. Blood was streaming from his nose, his eyes were glassy, and his skin was pale. Just past him was a counter that jutted out to form the kitchen on the other side. I could see Shelby hunched over on that far side, the flickering light coming from where he was facing, though I couldn’t see what he was looking at. I could barely hear him mumbling something unintelligible over the screeching winds blowing past the open door.

I took an uneasy step into the RV.

“Shelby? What’s going on?” I shouted over the wind.

He twisted his head around and stared at me with his black hole eyes, like an owl. I felt my willpower leave my body and I began to feel queasy. His head swiveled back to whatever he was doing without saying anything to me. 

I slowly crept forwards despite my primal urges screaming at me to back away. I stepped around his dad. The muffled sound of rain slamming the roof and the river forming underneath the floor was overwhelming.

“Shelby! Dude!” My voice quavered, unsure of what to do.

He turned his head once again, clearly surprised that I was still there.

“Get the hell out of here! Go!” He screamed at me, his voice commanding in a way I didn’t know he could do.

“I want to know what’s going on here!” My voice was dwarfed by his. I stepped forward again. I could now make out the edge of something past the counter, orange and glowing brightly on the ground. A limp foot was sticking out past it.



Shelby stepped out of the kitchen. A kitchen knife gleamed in the red light, fixed to his right hand. His open left palm had a huge, bleeding gash. Red stains covered the front of his shirt. Otherwise, he looked dry. 

“If you knew what was good for you, you’d leave. Right now.” His narrow eyes stared into my soul.

I garnered whatever faith I had left in the pit of my stomach and I rushed forwards.

“Shelby, your dad looks dead! Did you do this?” I shouted at him, grabbing his collar in one hand, the other gripping his right wrist.

The rain began to quiet. I couldn’t meet his piercing gaze up close. I looked behind him onto the kitchen floor.

His mom was spread flat above a strange red sigil. She had the same features as his dad. Her stomach had a brightly glowing orange hole covering it, some kind of fiery vortex, folding inwards and pulsing.

Shelby grimaced and I felt his right arm tense up as it pushed towards me. I jerked his arm with all my strength and knocked it against the wall, the knife being flung from his grip, clattering to the ground by his dad.

He shoved me back and my wet hand lost grip on his collar. I fell to the ground and watched as he turned his back on me and approached the vortex. He opened his left palm over it and blood began to quickly pour out, disappearing into the fire.

The rain started slamming hard against the roof again. The torrent underneath the floor was roaring. The RV began to shudder. I clambered to my feet.

The blood slowed and stopped flowing from his hand. He squeezed it shut hard, trying to will more out, but nothing came. I watched, terrified, as his hand moved up to his mouth. The RV was starting to tilt to the side.

Holding onto the edge of the counter, Shelby stuck a finger down his throat. 

He doubled over and began to heave into the vortex. My feet finally found their traction and I backed away towards the door. The RV felt as if it were about to lose itself in the river of blood below us. I turned and ran as I felt it shift dramatically to the side. 

I blindly leaped out of the wildly flapping door, hitting a warm torrent of blood that was dragging me down the wide river still forming. The rotting copper stench invaded my senses. All I could see was red. I clawed at the mud below me, searching for something to grab. I coughed and gagged as blood forced its way into my nose and throat.

My hands clenched around a pipe embedded in the ground at the edge of the river. I pulled myself up with all my force. I dragged myself to the shoreline, covered in bloodfoam. I got on my hands and knees and started to vomit what I had swallowed.

It took me a minute, drenched in the downpour, barely staying in place in the slick mud before I could stand. My shaking legs planted in the congealed blood below me and I looked at the river. It was so dark, it was nearly black. The deluge was still growing, and I saw my car floating away in the distance. Further beyond it was Shelby’s RV, half sunken. My feet slipped as I ran away.

I made it to an RV near the edge of the park whose inhabitants took me in gladly. 

It took hours before the rain finally subsided. But when it did, the sight was unbelievable. Dark red sludge coated the entire park and the river sat, wide and still, various RVs and powerlines and trees sunk in at odd angles. 

It took days before rescue teams could pull people off of their roofs and into the school gymnasium that was filled to the brim with makeshift cots and stacks of canned foods. 

Even now, months later, the signs of damage are obvious. Plenty of buildings are still entirely stained red, practically all remaining pavement, and many basements have collapsed in and become giant, festering, disease-ridden petri dishes. 

The hospital my mom works at has been filled to the brim with critical-condition pneumonia patients from inhaling blood into their lungs. Fewer people contracted malaria and/or HCV. I’ve hardly seen *any* animals since. Lots of grass and shrubs have altogether died. The soil must be contaminated.

In all the chaos since, I haven’t been able to shake what I saw out of my mind. Not the flood itself, but the contents of that terrible RV. I don’t know why he did it. I don’t know how he did it. I hope to God that he’s dead. Nobody’s seen him since. The official reports list him and his parents as victims of the flooding. 

The bodies, the sigil, the portal. The blood Shelby poured into it. I feel a knot in my stomach when I picture him trying to vomit into it. 

I know it sounds crazy, but I think something is going to happen again. I think it’ll be soon. If he could cause this, surely he was going to do more. I can’t imagine the havoc from a storm of *another kind* of rain. It's been many months since the flood, so maybe we’re in the clear. 

But, I swear to god, just this morning, walking outside to take out the trash, the air reeked of vinegar, bitter and acrid.
