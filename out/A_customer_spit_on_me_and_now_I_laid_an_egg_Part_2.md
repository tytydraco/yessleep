I gave up pretending it was fine.

I sat hunched over the kitchen table, cradling a hot mug I hadn’t touched, phone pressed to my ear with a clammy hand. My head felt like it was full of steam. Every breath came with a faint bubbling and crackling sound at the back of my throat.

I punch in the numbers to my social security and press pound. 

The doctor answered on the second ring.

“Dr. Palmer,” he said, too cheerful for how my skin felt like it was trying to peel away from the inside. “Is this Leonna?”

“Yes, it’s me,” I croaked.

I could hear him clicking something, typing. Probably pulling up my file. Probably not really listening.

“I’ve started the antibiotics,” I said. “But I feel worse. I’ve been coughing up a lot. And I threw up. It was-” I paused. “It was mostly mucus.”

“Mmm,” he murmured, like I’d told him I had a headache. “Okay, that’s not unusual if there’s drainage. Are you having any trouble breathing?”

I hesitated.

Was I?

It felt like I should be. Like there was something in my lungs that shouldn’t be there, but my breath still came. Shallow, damp, but it came.

“…Not exactly,” I said. “It’s wet, though. Thick. And my stomach is cramping. A lot. I just feel really off.”

“Well, it’s still early,” he said, his voice warm, annoyingly confident. “Sometimes the antibiotics take a couple days to really start working. Give it another forty-eight hours, and if you’re still feeling this way, we’ll get you back in for a recheck.”

There was a pause.

“If it gets worse, especially if you do start having trouble breathing, don’t wait. Go straight to the ER.”

“Okay,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “Right. Thank you.”

We hung up.

I stared at my phone for a long time. My reflection on the screen looked sweaty, yellow-lit. Contaminated.

I put myself back in bed, I took an oxy I saved from my wisdom tooth extraction last year. I figure I can sleep this shit off. Hopefully. 

Exhaustion overtakes me. 

I’m not in water.

I’m beneath it.

There’s pressure pressing down on my body, thick and unrelenting, not crushing, but possessing. Like the water has hands. Like it’s holding me down, keeping me where I belong.

Above me, there is no surface. Just darkness.

Below me, something glows.

A pale ring of light, miles wide. Pulsing. Organic. I can feel it in my bones, a throb like a heartbeat, but not mine. With each pulse, the water thickens. It becomes almost too heavy to keep my eyes open.

But I do.

Because I see it.

Far below, something is rising.

It’s not a creature. It’s not that simple. It’s a shape. A concept. A presence so massive it doesn’t even move the water, the water moves for it. Parts of it gleam wetly, folding and unfurling like lungs made of jellyfish or maybe oil dancing on the surface of water. I catch glimpses of tentacles, ridges, an opening like a mouth. But it’s all suggestion, never full form.

It doesn’t need to show me what it is.

Something opens inside my chest.

I look down and see my ribcage glowing. Not with light, with movement. With shapes swimming behind my sternum like minnows in an aquarium.

I open my mouth to scream and the sound that comes out is the same whale-song I heard the other night.

My voice isn’t mine anymore.

I woke up choking.

Something is in my mouth. Thick. Slippery. Alive.

I lurch upright, gagging, hands flying to my face as I start heaving. A low, wet retch tears through my chest, and a glob of thick, translucent mucus pours from my lips. It hits my chest, then slides down between my breasts. It's way too dense. Gelatinous. Like a jellyfish. I swipe at it in blind panic and smear it across my shirt like slime.

I stumble out of bed and crash to the floor. My stomach lurches. My throat spasms again.

Another cough, deep, like it’s coming from my pelvis this time, and I feel something tear loose.

A long, slick rope of mucus comes up, dragging along the back of my throat, stringy and bubbling with every gasping breath. It tastes sour, metallic, like blood and bile blended with spoiled seawater. It sticks to my teeth and coils across the floor when I finally manage to spit it out.

I stayed there for a minute on all fours, panting, light-headed. I can still feel it inside me. Like there’s more.

The nausea passes, but now my eyes burn.

Not just itchy, though it's a tickle that turns into deep, needling pressure, like something is stuck behind them.

I crawl to the bathroom, dragging sticky trails behind me, and claw myself up to the sink. My reflection looks pale, blotchy, eyes glassy with fever and then I see it.

My iris’ ripple.

Like pond water.

Like something just dropped in and sent waves across the surface.

“No. No, no.”

I blink hard, hoping it’s a trick of the light, but the ripple happens again. A slow, concentric wave pushing outward from the center of my eye. My iris shudders. My sclera looks too moist. Like it’s not made of eye anymore.

And then, then I see movement. My stomach drops.

In the corner of my left eye, near the tear duct, I feel an itch. I see a bulge. Something slithering.

I freeze.

It’s moving on its own.

My fingers reach up, trembling. I brace against the sink with my other hand, bile rising in my throat.

I press into the corner of my eye with the pad of my finger. It’s swollen and warm and something shifts.

I rip my hand away from my eye and stand back, letting out a panicked cry as I shake my hands. 

Fuck, fuck. What the fuck?

I take a breath and resume my previous position. A grimace is plastered on my face. I reach up. Then…

I dig in gently.

Something wet squirms.

I find an edge. A texture. It feels a little like sandpaper but also soft, slick… stringy.

I pinch it.

And I pull.

The resistance is immediate. Whatever it is, it’s coiled. My eye screams in protest as I drag the thing out slowly, inch by inch. I hold my eyelids open with my other hand as my eye tries to reflexively close. Whatever this shit is, it needs to get out. 

It burns. I feel it drag behind the socket, threading through nerves and ducts and places no part of my body it should ever reach.

My vision blurs as it stretches out. I let out a whimper. I see it come into view a long, ribbon-like strand, wet and dark green. I rip the rest out desperate to get it over with. The resistance finally gives, my eye feels like it's on fire. I squeeze it shut.

It smells fishy. 

It’s seaweed.

Real seaweed.

Veined and slimy, with a faint golden shimmer running through its spine. It glistens in the light. Still warm.

I drop it into the sink and it coils softly like it’s trying to form letters. Like it’s alive. Like it’s waiting.

I start to cry, hot, thick tears that feel thicker than normal. They run down my face like syrup.

I stumble back toward the bedroom, slip on something wet. My hands tremble as I grab my phone.

I dial 911.

It rings once.

Twice.

Then the line picks up. I let out a sob of relief but then I hear it. 

Low. Deep.

A vibration more than a noise. A tone that makes my sinuses ache. It thrums through the phone, through my palm, up my arm. I hear it in the back of my throat before I hear it in my ear.

A whale song.

Long and mournful and wrong.

Then comes the water.

Rushing water. Not static. Not a glitch. The sound of tides. Of currents. Of pressure descending.

I pull the phone away from my ear. But it’s still vibrating. Still humming that deep, wet note.

My nose starts to bleed.

Thick, dark, and slow.

I drop the phone.

It hit the floor with a dull thud, still humming. Still bleeding that whale-song into the air like a low prayer. The kind of sound that makes the back of your teeth ache.

I barely had time to breathe before it hit me.

A pain.

Low. Deep.

It wasn't sharp, not at first. Just a building pressure low in my pelvis, like gravity had suddenly quadrupled. Like something inside me had shifted downward.

I doubled over, gripping the edge of the sink, my breath catching.

Then the second wave hit.

Stronger.

A full-body spasm that clenched from my spine to my thighs. My abdomen twisted like it was being wrung out. The muscles squeezed around something solid, something wet, and I felt a slow, involuntary pulse between my legs.

I cried out, not in pain, exactly. In shock. In horror.

“What the fuck,” I gasped. “What the fuck is this?”

Another contraction rolled through me.

This time it hurt.

My knees buckled, and I hit the floor hard, palms slapping into a puddle I hadn’t noticed before. My vision swam, black dots dancing around the corners of my eyes. I tried to crawl, but my stomach clenched again and held.

My body was pushing.

And I wasn’t doing it.

The sensation was primal. My hips ached. My thighs spasmed. The pressure between my legs was unbearable. Hot, wet, and constant, like something heavy was slowly forcing its way out of me.

I was sweating. Shaking. Leaking.

Not blood.

Something else.

Clear. Thick. It soaked through my underwear, down my thighs, pooling on the bathroom tile with each wave. My skin felt slippery. My hands were coated in mucus.

I pressed my forehead to the cold floor and sobbed.

This wasn't labor.

This was infection.

This was birth-as-disease.

Something shifted inside me. Moved. I could feel it curl up, like it was adjusting position. Getting ready.

And my body kept pushing.

I scream as the next contraction tears through me.

It’s not human anymore the sounds I make. It bursts from my throat, raw and ragged, pulled straight from my guts. I can feel the muscles deep in my pelvis locking, clenching, pressing something downward.

Another slick flood of fluid spills out of me, gelatinous. Pools beneath me like the afterbirth of something that hasn’t even come yet.

My hands shake as I snatch the phone again, fingers slipping against the mucus-slick screen.

MOM.

I press call. I don’t know what I expect. I need someone. Anyone. 

A voice. A breath. Anything human.

But when the line picks up, the whale song hits me like a fist.

Louder now. Deeper. Like it’s being funneled straight into my bones. My eardrums flutter from the pressure. The phone vibrates in my palm, and it’s not just the speaker, the sound is inside it, like the device is alive and singing with it.

Then the waves hit.

The crash of water is deafening, surging through the line like a dam breaking. White noise, but darker. It sounds wet. Real. Like I’m standing in the center of a flood. I can almost feel it rushing over me. My ears pop. My throat closes.

Then, the next contraction seizes me.

And I wail. I wail for my mom, for help, for the fact I'm stuck in this nightmare.

I let out another long, guttural cry that tears my throat raw, and halfway through, the sound shifts.

My voice bends. Warps.

It becomes the same tone as the whale.

We’re in sync.

It’s not just the phone anymore.

The sound is everywhere.

The walls vibrate. The windows rattle. The floor trembles under me. My ribs ache with it. My teeth ring like glass in a storm.

My scream folds into the sound around me, and the whale-song responds, louder, wetter, closer. The pitch climbs and climbs and climbs until it’s not just a song.

It’s a chorus.

It’s me.

It’s them.

It’s everything.

A symphony of wailing.

One long, spiraling howl of grief and pressure and birth.

I cover my ears but it’s no use. The sound is inside me. It’s under my skin. It’s in my blood.

And then I feel it.

Movement.

Something drops inside me low, sudden. Like a weight hitting the base of my spine. My hips burn. My thighs shake.

Something is coming.

I try to scream again, but all that comes out is a thick, bubbling moan and a mouthful of mucus.

I spit. Cough. Choke.

And still the wailing rises.

There is no air. No silence. No room for thoughts.

Only the birthsong.

And my body pushing.

My body is gone.

All I am now is pain.

A seizing, animal fire tearing through my lower half. My hips pulled wide, skin stretched to its breaking point, everything wet and slick and unbearably full. The pressure is unbearable. It's like I’m trying to push a stone out of my spine, something too hard, too solid, not made to pass through flesh.

I scream, but my voice is a rasp now. Spent. Burned out. My throat feels like it’s been scoured raw with salt.

My skin is soaked. My hair sticks to my face in stringy clumps. My shirt is plastered to me with layers of sweat, amniotic fluid, and mucus. I don’t even know anymore. I’m leaking from everywhere. Puddling under me. I am nothing but fluid.

I push again.

The pain rips through me like a serrated blade. I feel something shift, slide. I can feel it. Not round, not smooth. It scrapes against the inside of me.

I cry out. A strangled, angry noise. Not just pain now, rage. Why is this happening? Why is my body doing this?

The next contraction comes and I can’t stop it. I bear down. I scream.

And I feel it crown.

It stretches me open with slow, merciless pressure. Burning. Splitting. A deep, red-hot sensation of tearing  like someone is taking a blowtorch to my cervix. My muscles scream. My back arches. I slam a fist into the tile just to have something to hurt besides my own skin.

The pain is beyond language now.

It doesn’t come in waves anymore. It’s one long, unbearable crush, grinding deep into my pelvis like I’m being torn apart by something with purpose. My hips are splitting. My spine pulses with heat. Every inch of me is wet. Sweat, mucus, amniotic slime and still, my body keeps pushing.

My hands claw at the floor, smearing trails of fluid as I sob through clenched teeth. I can feel the pressure shifting, something descending, slow and solid and wrong-shaped. My thighs tremble, and my breath stutters in broken gasps as the last push rips through me with animal force.

My vision flashes white. I push.

And finally, finally-

It slides out.

Not all at once.

Slowly.

Wetly.

Not like a baby. There’s no relief. No release. Just a wet, slapping sound as the mass hits the tile, heavy and slippery, dragging a string of mucus and blood behind it like a tail.

I collapse sideways, every nerve shivering. My body is buzzing. Numb with pain, choked with exhaustion. My skin feels hollow. I can’t breathe through my nose anymore. My mouth is open, gasping for air. I taste salt and copper and the bitter backwash of stomach acid

But I look.

I have to look.

I turn to stare at it, trembling. Still on all fours, the floor digs into my bones. 

What I see is twisted. 

It’s long, maybe sixteen, seventeen inches and shaped nothing like a human child. Not round. Not soft. Not familiar. Its surface is ridged and semi-translucent in places, veined with green-black lines that pulse faintly like blood vessels. The outer skin glistens with a slimy sheen that catches the light like a film of oil. Horned tendrils curve out from each end, not decorative, but functional. They twitch slightly, still coated in birthing fluid, curling in slow motion like it’s adjusting to the air.

It’s not inanimate.

It’s breathing.

The sac shifts gently, just once, and I see movement inside.

A mermaid’s purse.

It doesn’t cry.

It hums.

The same whale-song, now tiny. Soft. Like it’s inside my skull.

My throat tightens. I drag myself closer, trembling, one elbow at a time. My stomach lurches, but I ignore it. 

I have to see.

There’s a slit along the underside of the purse, a natural seam, slightly agape. Not torn. Not cut. A biological invitation.

I reach out with a shaking hand, fingertips numb and sticky with blood and sweat. The membrane is warm. Pliable. Wet.

I hook two fingers into the slit and peel it open.

And I see what I’ve birthed.

My stomach flips. The air leaves my lungs in a sharp, silent sob.

It’s not human.

It’s barely a shape.

Curled inside the sac is something that should not exist. Its skin is soft and waxy, slick with a translucent film. The flesh is mottled, pale grey, faintly pink in places, like rotting fish meat. Its body is twisted in on itself, limbs tangled in unnatural poses, long and boneless like wet rope. No symmetry. No sense of design. Just limbs for the sake of limbs.

It looks like a baby.

But only if you squint. Only if you lie to yourself.

Its head is bulbous, domed, almost too large for its body. The face is collapsed, sunken where features should be. No nose. No eyes I can make sense of. Just ridges. Folds. A slit of a mouth that quivers, opening slightly as if tasting the air.

Inside, rows of tiny teeth.

Too many.

It makes a sound, soft, wet. Almost a mewl. Almost a purr. Something between a sigh and a bubble bursting. The sac around it trembles gently, and I realize it’s not in pain. It’s content.

It doesn’t know it should be dead.

It doesn’t know I should be dead.

Its limbs twitch. Its body presses gently against the inside of the sac, and I see a thin, pulsing cord still attached to it buried in a fold of its skin. Not a belly button. Just part of it.

Part of me.

I choke back a sob.

It’s not just alien.

It’s mine.

I close the sac.

I can’t look anymore. I can’t think. My heart is thudding out of sync. My ears are ringing. I try to wipe my mouth and smear it with mucus instead. My hands shake violently as I pull away from the thing.
No, the child, my creature, my horror.

And that’s when I feel it again.

The pressure.

But this time,

It’s in my throat.

The pressure in my throat doesn’t subside.

It swells.

It’s not the urge to cough. Not bile rising. Not nausea.

It’s something moving inside me.

I can feel it curl up from behind my sternum, not fast, not violent. Intentional. It’s pushing upward like it knows the way, like it’s done this before. Like my body is no longer mine.

Each breath I take feels thicker, heavier. I try to swallow and feel something slip behind my breastbone. My neck twitches. My jaw aches.

But I have to see.

I have to see.

I crawl through the slick puddle of fluids and blood, dragging my limbs like sacks of meat. The floor makes wet sounds beneath me, sticky and echoing, like walking on fish guts. I’m crying without realizing it, hot, slow tears mixing with sweat and spit and mucus already leaking down my chin.

My elbows catch the base of the sink. I haul myself up, trembling. My arms want to give out. My stomach clenches with leftover spasms from the birth. Every inch of skin feels used up.

But I have to see. 

I lift myself high enough to look into the mirror.

And I see something I don’t recognize.

My face is grayish, bloated. My eyes… my eyes are rippling. Irises flexing outward. The whites shimmer faintly. The blood vessels in them are swollen, like roots, like coral. 

I blink.

It ripples again and again. 

And then I feel the urge. My mouth.

My mouth. Something is in my mouth. 

I open it.

Wide.

And I stare.

What I see inside me should not exist.

Where my tongue should be, there is a creature.

Pale pink or grey, the color of raw shrimp. Bulbous and fat near the throat, narrowing toward the tip like a slick worm. It’s glistening. Wet. Attached to the base of my mouth like it belongs there.

Its tiny clawed legs grip the floor of my mouth. Its body pulses in rhythm with my heartbeat. And it has eyes.

Two tiny black glints near the front, not eyes like ours, but shiny, protruding, watching me. They twitch when I move. I feel it shift slightly, responding to my breath, as though adjusting.

I want to scream.

But the parasite beats me to it.

It clicks.

A small sound, high-pitched and wet. Like the start of speech. Like the back of a throat trying to form consonants.

My body jerks.

My jaw opens wider.

And the thing moves.

I feel it stretch deeper into me, tighten its grip, and press upward. It slides ever so slightly along the roof of my mouth. The sensation is unbearable like warm jelly mixed with cartilage. I can feel its slime coating my palate, its bristled legs scraping ever so slightly with each motion.

I gag.

But it doesn’t move out of the way.

It braces.

Like it knows what’s coming.

Then,

My throat convulses.

Now.

The pressure that had been building in my esophagus erupts.

My body seizes. My spine arches. My neck bulges grotesquely. Something is climbing. I feel the sharp, expanding pressure as the walls of my throat stretch around it.

My gag reflex fails entirely. My mouth fills with a taste I can’t describe, salt and membrane like eating raw pork. 

I try to breathe and choke instead.

My stomach clenches. I double over the sink.

And I vomit.

But not food. Not bile. Not even mucus.

It bulges out of my throat like a tumor, long, solid, alive. The parasite in my mouth twitches violently as it passes, legs scraping the roof of my mouth as if trying to guide it. My jaw splits wider than it should, skin pulling painfully and tearing away at the corners of my lips. A tendon in my cheek pops.

I can’t scream. I can’t sob. I can only retch.

It scrapes along my teeth as it finally emerges. 


My baby. 

Another. 

A thick, leathery sac, coated in slime and blood, stretching a string of mucus from my lips to its twitching form as it slaps wetly onto the tile.

I fall to my knees again, sobbing and coughing.

Blood mixes with mucus. My body trembles.

My mouth stays open.

The parasite settles back into place, content. As though it’s merely waiting for the next one.

And in front of me, the new mermaid’s purse lies pulsing, softly.

Inside, something kicks.

Another contraction hits.

I don't even have time to react. 

It slams through me like a tidal wave of heat and knives, folding my body into itself. I scream, or try to, but it comes out as a strangled, gurgling moan, thick with mucus. My throat is shredded. My mouth tastes like blood.

I can’t do this again.

I can't.

I won’t.

But my body doesn't care.

It squeezes, clenches, pushes, and something shifts deep inside. Something big.

A sob breaks in my chest.

I roll to my side and reach for the wall, for anything, and I start to crawl.

I don't know where I'm going.

I just know I have to go.

My arms shake with every movement. My muscles are cooked. My skin is raw. Every inch I drag myself across the floor leaves a slick trail of blood bile and birthing fluid.

I reach out with my left hand, fingers digging into the grout lines. 

And my fingernail pops off.

Just snaps. Blood oozes up instantly. The tile beneath me slickens.

I whimper. I try again.

Rip.

Another nail tears backward, skin splitting beneath it like overripe fruit. It stings, sharp and deep, but I keep going. My hand leaves red smears behind me like paintbrush strokes.

The mermaid purses begin to wail.

One at first, a high-pitched, bubbling sound, like a newborn crossed with a broken wind instrument. Then another joins. Then another.

A chorus.

Their wails fill the apartment, shrill, wet, inhuman.

They scream in pulses, like they’re syncing with my contractions. Like they’re encouraging the next one.

They want more. 

I sob as another contraction wracks me.

I collapse. I lie flat, cheek against the cold, sticky tile. I heave, dry and wet at once. My belly tightens. I feel something twist inside me, still alive, still coming.

I close my eyes.

I want to die.

I want it to stop.

But the wailing doesn’t stop.

I rest for a moment. One minute. Maybe more. It hurts to even blink. My lips are cracked. My hands shake.

Then I crawl again.

I claw forward.

I dig into the wood of the hallway floorboards, tearing more nails off, hunks of wood splintering off into my fingers, scraping skin, leaving little pieces of myself behind. Every drag forward costs me. My arms burn. My thighs tremble. My body sobs beneath me, even if my voice can’t.

The wailing gets louder.

They’re all awake now. I know, now, there are more than just two. 

Some of the sacs twitch. One of them ruptures with a wet sound behind me, like a jellyfish splitting open. I hear something slap the ground.

But I don’t look back.

I can't.

I reach the front door.

My hand trembles as I reach up, blood trailing down my forearm, mucus clinging to my knuckles and I grip the knob.

Another contraction punches through my spine.

I double over. Vomit. Mucus pours from my nose. My stomach hollows.

I scream. I scream and they scream with me.

Their wailing is unbearable.

Like glass and sirens and whales and babies. All warped together into one never-ending cry that echoes inside my skull.

The door shakes under my hand.

I twist the knob.

It turns.

I open it.

The sound doesn’t stop.

It crescendos.

And in front of me.

There is nothing.

Just sea.

Endless, black water stretching to the ends of the earth. No land. No stars. Just waves rolling, breathing, waiting.

The wind rushes in around me.

The cries swell.

The mermaid’s purses behind me squirm. They’re calling to it.

To their home.

I laugh, or try to. It comes out in a shallow huff. 

All this?? For what??

The waves lap at the door frame. 

It's calling me. 

So I fall forward.

Back into the sea.
