When the Romans said “Caveat Emptor”  (which was Roman for buyers beware) … believe them. 

It all started when I was shopping with my bros in New York City.  I was on vacation from my house in L.A. visiting my uncle who works on Wall Street.  He was pretty busy one day because of all the DOGE stuff going on, so he just left $357 on the kitchen table with a note that said “Have at it, bro.  This kinda cash is chump change to us wolf of Wall Street types (too bad I don't get as many girls as Leo D).  Enjoy!”

It was basically the most money I'd seen in my entire life.  I worked a full time job doing computers at Best Buy, but L.A. is expensive, so basically after bills I usually don't have that much leftover. 

I took my uncle's cash and decided to go to the Nintendo World Store near 30 Rock.  I took the subway and got out at the station right outside the store.  I almost ran into a midget that my honey swore was Peter Dinklage, but that's neither here nor there.

I went into the store, but everything was so expensive.  It was such a rip-off, until I saw something weird.  It was a copy of the indie JRPG Sea of Stars but it only cost $7.  I thought surely this was a pricing mistake, so I took it to the gamer girl at the front counter to see if my eyes deceived me. 

“That will be $7” said the gamer girl. 

“Are you sure? This is a brand new copy of a Nintendo switch game.  Often they cost $70, though many of the smaller indie games cost $30 to maximum $50.”

At this point she started looking around nervously and getting kind of panicky.  She saw the boss of the store coming and she shoved the game into my chest and whispered “for the love of God please just take it and leave.  I've already removed the magnetic anti theft strip so just leave.”

I knew from working at Best Buy that what she said was true, and I was STOKED! I’d wanted to play this game for a long time and I just got it for free. 

Even though my uncle was kind of a bro wall street type, he was a gamer nerd was back in the 90s.  He always told me about this game he used to play back in college at Harvard called Chrono Trigger.  He said it changed his life.  I know I was too young for Chrono Trigger, so I always wanted to play Sea of Stars.  It seemed like the closest us Gen Z and Millennial gamers will ever experience to the magic of the time that Akira Toriyama collaborated with Nobuo Uematsu and one of the main guys (also Japanese) from Final Fantasy. 

(The people who made Sea of Stars were probably white but I think it's still as close as we're gonna get.)

As I was riding the subway to my uncle's loft in Williamsburg (yeah he was THAT guy), I opened the case to admire my newly acquired indie darling.  But a few weird things happened as the subway was passing through time square.  

The case was really hard to open.  I struggled to get it open and cut my finger.  But my finger was bleeding a lot.  Like, way more than it should have been.  Luckily I saw a woman in a nurses uniform on the train.

“Can you help me?” I said to her?

She just stared at me.  Her vacant eyes darted between my face and my finger, back and forth about 15 times.  Then she just looked deep into my eyes and smiled…but it just felt…wrong.  Her smile felt…impossibly long? Like it extended beyond the limits of her face.

It immediately creeped me out.  Since I got the game for free, I ended up just using one of the $100 from my uncle to wrap the wound.  

That creeped me the fuck out, but I figured New Yorkers were weird so I just went back to my seat.  I popped the game into my switch, and noticed the cartridge was red.  Normally switch cartridges are black, but I figured this was probably a special edition. 

I laughed at what a fool that gamer girl was…this thing was probably worth about $700 on eBay.  Little did I know there was a good reason why she wanted to get rid of it. 

As I started playing, I noticed my switch was low on battery.  In fact it was at 0%, but somehow the game was running.  Weird, right? But what was even weirder was that it wouldn't let me leave the main menu or anything else.

I hit the menu button on the switch, and nothing would happen.  I figured it was probably a glitch from my $350 OLED Switch (what can I say, my uncle had Trump money and got me it for the trip) having no battery.  Honestly I was relieved the game was running at all.

The game was fun, but something seemed…off.  All the music seemed slightly off key.  The character art for Zale and Velere just felt…wrong.  And that's when I noticed, none of the characters had pupils.  Just dead milky whites for all their eyes. 

While it unsettled me, I figured this was a subversion against Akira Toriyama’s iconic anime art style? I didn't like it, but figured this was maybe how a white person studio might handle this kind of art style? 

While I was unsettled, I kept playing.  Despite the art and music being off, it was still pretty fun.  

Until I got the most disturbing part.  I got to the part at the beginning during a childhood flashback where a character named Garl receives an attack.  When it happened, my screen started glitching out and, weirdly, the screen started zooming into Garl’s face, while this creepy distorted music box type music started playing. 

His eye looked…horrific.  And while the rest of his face was done in a 16-bit pixel art style…the wounded eye was completely photo realistic.  And the camera kept zooming closer and closer, the music growing louder and louder…until it was the only thing visible on the screen. 

The next thing I knew, the subway had completely stopped and all the lights went out.  The only source of illumination was my OLED switch screen.  Except the way OLED works, the blacks are true black and offer no illumination at all.  So I couldn't see shit at all. 

I stood shivering in the pitch black for about 15 minutes, when I saw a shadowy figure heading my way from down the train car.  It had a female voice and it kept whispering “you killed him.  you killed him.” It floated closer and closer to me until I noped the fuck out.  I ran from car to car until finally I was at the engineers bay.  I started banging on the doors with both fists screaming “start the train! start the train!” I looked over my shoulder and saw the figure still floating.

I banged and screamed louder and louder.  Nothing.  Finally, in a panic, I threw my OLED switch like a shuriken at the figure.  A corner hit it directly in the eye (the same eye that Garl lost), and the shadowy figure immediately dissipated.

The lights on that train activated, and the train started proceding like normal.  I looked around, and everyone else was acting like nothing had happened? 

I grabbed my switch, popped out the cartridge and immediately put it back in it's case. 

I got off the train at the next stop and got on the next train to the Nintendo World Store and immediately tried to return the game. 

I went to the clerk for the return.  When he scanned the game, he gave me a puzzled look.  He said that game isn't appearing in the system at all.  In fact, he said a physical version of Sea of Stars didn't even exist.  He said I probably was tricked into buying a bootleg.

When I told him about the girl who sold me the game, his face went pale as a ghost.  He told me there used to be a girl like that who worked there, but she was killed by a serial killer.  The only thing left of her that the police could find was her right eye. 

After hearing that, I dropped the game and noped the fuck out of there.
