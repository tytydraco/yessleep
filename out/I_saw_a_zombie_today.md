I was driving home from work when I saw the guy, he was wearing bloody pajamas and wandering around in some kind of trance. When he saw my car pass he started chasing after it like a rabid dog. I was too fast through and eventually I got away from him.

The news was full of weird stories lately, more missing persons, increased homicides. I live in a small town in Georgia and so this was unusual. People I talked to on a regular basis were suddenly gone but I figured it they were taking sick days or maybe on vacation. I don't know, people around here don't really go on vacation, they take time off and you see them downtown at one of the two bars we have in this town.

It was when I saw that guy in the pajamas that I realized that zombies were actual real things. I knew in the pit of my stomach that something big and dangerous was happening. I called my girlfriend and told her what had happened and insisted she come to my place for awhile until this thing blows over.

You might be thinking, lives in small southern town, must be a country boy good with guns and surviving in the wilderness. You would be wrong, I grew up in the Atlanta suburbs and eventually became a truck driver. My mom ended up marrying this guy after my dad died and she moved down here. The guy died and left her his house, then she died and gave it to me. So I came down here to look after it.

I'm posting this here to, I guess, share my actual feelings on what's happening throughout the country right now. I cant talk to my girlfriend, she needs me to be strong and resolute. But I need to tell somebody that I'm scared and that I don't think this situation is going to end well for any of us. I'm keeping track of events in Europe and South America. They're experiencing similar upticks in disappearances and violence that we are in the United States.

For a couple of months there's been this wave of increased missing persons reports. Then came the random homicides, some of which were recorded and posted on social media. They're all the same, you see a few disheveled people walking along in the distance, their clothes are blood stained, they look like they're in some kind of trance. Then they attack some birthday party or drunk party goers, or just random people going about their business. Some people are saying they're corpses returning to life but that's impossible. I think there's some kind of virus going around making people crazy. I've been drinking bottled water and wearing a mask for a couple weeks. People around here give me condescending looks but I've always been cautious person.

This is just day one and I feel like there's something building that will explode soon. I'm keeping this record so that people will know what happened to me. I have to go now, my girlfriend just pulled up.
