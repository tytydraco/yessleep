I shine my torch on the aging sign outside of Miss Verschlechterung’s property, it reads: “Wedding dress for sale - never used”. I walk forward through the snow, up her long garden. I’ve been called here about a fight between her and Mr Ofre. The steps of their house are wooden and creak with each step. Their door, too, is made of eroding wood. I do not knock; the door is ajar. It creaks as I push it open and shine my torch inside.

The hallway is a mess of pots and pans, and broken plates laying in random positions in peculiar places. A picture of Miss Verch (a.k.a Verschlechterung) and Mr Ofre is cracked on a cabinet by the door. I step over the aftermath of something and make my way leftwards into the living room.

I feel ill when I see the state of the room. All is well except two smashed urns laying on the floor. They’ve been knocked off a shelf. I crouch down and examine the pile. Two craters are in the pile of ash. A trail of it runs elsewhere. I stand and follow the trail.

It leads to a stairway downwards, but before the first step is a rug. It is roughened and misaligned, like someone has roughly dragged a heavy object across it. The ashes are not impacted by the rough rug; they must’ve happened afterwards.

I follow the ashes into the dark abyss. They lead me to another wooden door far below all else. I push at the door - it is locked, but I hear a rattle with each push. I take a deep breath and begin to kick down the door. After 4 kicks, it gives way and I am permitted entry.

I shine the torch on what was blocking the door; a the chained up body of Mr Ofre. The ash trail ends at his face; in his mouth. A pile also surrounds his head: he must’ve been trying to fight back.

I cannot do much but stare at the restrained corpse, so I retreat back up to the living room.

From the living room, I go up the breaking stairs in the hallway to the second floor. All the doors are open except one. I approach the door and find it locked; it takes 6 kicks to break its lock.

Inside the room, a window is open, letting a cold draft blow at me. The rest of the room is uncomfortably hard; there’s not a pillow in sight. The mad Miss Verch must’ve placed them in another room. But there’s a bed. And someone in it. I cannot see her face. But I can see the lump of her body under the covers; Miss Verch is sleeping.

I turn, hoping to not wake her. I’ll call the professionals here instead of me.

I make my way down the stairs, quickly but carefully, and am stopped in my tracks. The door is closed, locked; I left it ajar.
