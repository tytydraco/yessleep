On April 19, 2018 a 24 year old woman named Stacey Moore went missing in Springdale, AR. She was last seen by witnesses getting into a white Toyota Camry after leaving a friend's apartment at approximately 10:15 PM.


In 2022, a vehicle fitting that description was spotted in the middle of a wooded area by hikers. Law enforcement was called to the scene and discovered that the vehicle appeared to be abandoned. Inside, the police found a few empty bottles of water, an empty box of saltine crackers, a small notebook and a pen. The following is what was written in the notebook.


My name is Stacey Moore and I've been kidnapped. I'm writing this in a notebook I had in my purse in order to document what has happened to me.


A short while ago, my friend Tara picked me up and we went to her apartment to hang out for a few hours. After leaving, I decided to take an Uber back to my place. At first, everything seemed fine. The Uber car pulled up next to me in the parking lot and I climbed into the backseat. The driver was friendly and asked me how my night was going before driving off in the direction of my destination. 

We engaged in some small talk for a few minutes until I noticed that he had missed the exit to my apartment. When I made him aware of this, he didn't respond. He just kept driving. I told him that he needed to turn around, but he just ignored me. Feeling very uneasy, I demanded that he stop the car or I would call the police, but he just continued driving without acknowledging me. 

I got out my phone only to see that it was completely dead, which didn't make any sense because, last I checked, it had almost a full charge. Panicking, I tried opening the doors but they were locked. I tried to unlock them, but I wasn't able to. Now completely terrified, I screamed at him to let me out. But he was no longer responding to me. I was crying and pleading with him to stop the car, but he just continued on. 

After a few more minutes of driving, we were in an isolated part of town near a wooded area. Without warning, the driver abruptly turned off of the road and into the woods. I didn't know where he was taking me, but I knew it wasn't anywhere good. I started furiously hitting the driver in an attempt to make him stop, but I almost broke my hand. Somehow, it felt like I was hitting a stone statue. All the while he continued driving, weaving through the trees. 

He drove for about five more minutes before abruptly slamming on the breaks. I pleaded with him not to hurt me and that I wouldn't tell anyone about this if he just let me out of the car, but he just continued looking straight ahead, saying nothing. I didn't know what he had planned for me, but I wasn't about to just sit back and let him assault me or worse. 

I tried kicking out the windows but they wouldn't budge. Out of desperation, I stabbed the driver in the eye with my apartment key but, again, it felt like stabbing solid rock and it didn't even scratch him. How is he like that? It doesn't make any sense. None of this makes any sense. I'm very scared and I don't know what to do. 


I have no way of checking the time but it feels like several hours have passed since I've been trapped here, and the driver still hasn't moved or said anything. I don't know if he's dead or what. I searched the car for anything that might help me escape but all I found were a few bottles of water and a box of crackers in the passenger seat floor. I don't know for sure, but I think they were meant for me. 

This is all so crazy. It feels like I've been awake for over twenty-four hours now and it's becoming more difficult to keep my eyes open. I'm so tired but I'm too scared to sleep. I just want to go home.

I don’t know what is going to happen, but I will update with any new developments.


Update 1 - I ended up falling asleep and when I woke up, I saw something frightening. The driver's head had moved. He is still sitting in the driver's seat, but his head is turned at an impossible angle and is now staring back at me. His eyes are wide open and he has a deadpan expression on his face. It's really creepy. I tried talking to him again, but he still won't say anything. I'm so scared. I just wish somebody would come and rescue me from this nightmare. 


Update 2 - The hours pass so slowly. I searched the car again but, aside from the crackers and water, there's nothing here. There aren't even any registration documents or anything in the glove compartment. I was able to search the Uber driver but there was nothing in his pockets. I've tried every way I can think of to try to escape but it's no use. The car is completely fortified and sealed tight. 


I'm feeling very anxious and it's getting hard for me to stave of the creeping panic attacks. I've been spending most of the time, aside from writing, watching the woods outside the windows. I keep watching and waiting, hoping that someone will find me soon.


Update 3 - He's smiling now! I fell asleep again and when I woke up the Uber driver was smiling. He's still in the same position he was before, but now he has a creepy over-stretched grin across his face. Panicking, I kicked at his face but, once again, it felt rock solid and he remained unscathed. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going crazy. 


Three nights have past since I've been here. I'm starting to feel claustrophobic and it's taking all of my mental strength to keep myself together. I took off my jacket and put it over the driver's face, but it does little to calm my nerves.


Update 4 - I dozed off again. When I woke up I saw that the Uber driver was still in the same position, but I was too afraid to remove the jacket to see if his facial expression had changed. I looked out one of the windows and almost choked with excitement when I saw the silhouettes of people standing in the distance. 


This was it! I was finally being rescued, I thought. In an attempt to get their attention, I screamed as loud as I could and banged my fists hard on the windows, but the people didn't move. They just remained standing in place. There are five of them and they are surrounding the car. 

It's too dark outside for me to make out any of their features, but it seems obvious that they're not here to rescue me. I can only assume that they must be associated with the Uber driver in some way. I'm fucking terrified. What are they planning to do? 


It seems like every time I fall asleep, I wake up to an escalation of this horrifying situation. I'm going to try my best to stay awake as long as I can and hope that I'll be rescued before anything else happens.


Update 5 - I managed to stay awake through the night. It's morning now and the people are still standing out there. I watched them all night and they haven't moved an inch. As the daylight slowly dawned, I could make out more of their features. They're all wearing long black robes and each one has a mask made of dead leaves covering their face. They all have their hands behind their back as if they're trying to conceal something. 


Update 6 - It is becoming very difficult to keep my eyes open. I'm not sure if I was hallucinating, but I could've sworn that I heard the driver speak. He spoke in a low voice that was different from how he spoke before. It sounded like he said "sleep." I asked him what he meant, but he didn't respond. I asked him who the people outside were, but he remained silent. I pleaded with him to talk to me and tell me what was going on, but he still wouldn't speak. 


The jacket remains draped over his face, and I dare not remove it for fear of what I might see. I have a bad feeling that something terrible is going to happen soon.


Update 7 - Despite my best efforts to stay awake, I ended up falling asleep again. When I awoke I saw that the people outside had moved closer. They're about three feet away from the car now and all of them have their arms raised, each holding a different item. There is a rope, a hammer, a knife, a saw, and a large jug.


I'm terrified, but I've been in a constant state of fear for so long that I've become numb. The only thing I can do now is stay awake long enough in hopes that someone finds me before it's too late. Because I think that the next time I fall asleep, those people are going to get to me, and I don't want to find out what they have planned.


I've counted seven nights since I've been trapped here and I've just consumed the last of the water and crackers. So no matter what, If I stay in this car much longer I'm going to die. All I can do is wait to be rescued. Surely by now my friends and family have noticed that I’m missing. There’s probably a search party out there looking for me. I just have to stay awake until they find me.


Update 8 - Another day has passed. I've managed to stay awake, but it's getting difficult to keep my eyes open. The people outside haven't moved, neither has the Uber driver. No matter what, I've got to keep my eyes open. I'm going to keep writing to try and keep myself awake. Oh God, please let someone find me. I want to go home. I want to take a nice long shower and sleep in my nice warm bed. I miss my


Oh no, I almost fell asleep. I have to stay awake I have to stay awake I have to stay awake I have to stay awake I have to stay awake I have to stay awake I have to stay awake I have to stay awake I have to stay awake I have to stay awake I have to stay awake I have to stay awake I have to sta
