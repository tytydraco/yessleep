“Be not afraid.”

I mean, we’ve all heard it if only from the memes at this point. Ha ha, biblically accurate angels, non Euclidean eye bullshit. 

But see, here’s the thing. I actually saw one the other day. And there’s a reason they say that, and it’s not what you think. 

Let me start over. 

So there I was, walking down Grand at.. probably half past midnight. It wasn’t too terribly dark with the street lights overhead, and enough bars were open that the sidewalks were still abuzz with drunkards and partiers. But suddenly I noticed I was completely alone. It was bizarre. It was like I just blinked and everyone around me vanished. 

“Be not afraid,” I heard from a tall, beautiful woman who seemed to have been there all along. She stood about six feet, long, flowing platinum hair, eyes hidden behind sunglasses despite it being so late. Early? Eh. 

I raised an eyebrow. I’m not a very spiritual man, but something about her presence just felt … powerful. Overwhelming. I stared at the woman. 

She smiled at me. She had exactly the right amount of teeth. 

They were blood-red. Perfectly clean, shiny and white. So many teeth. 

Caked with gore. 

Pristine. Immaculate. There was nothing wrong with her at all. 

Thankfully, her limbs were attached to her torso, just like you’d expect. She lifted one arm and it hovered toward me. I felt her talons dig into my flesh. 

She stood, arms at her sides, motionless. I felt at peac

Ow. Owwww. Her talons dug deeper into my chest. I sensed an immensely malicious intent. My heart ached as the tips of her innumerable claws grazed it. 

Man, she was beautiful. And with the perfect amount of limbs! Her hair flowed in the wind, dripping blood - pure, clean, untarnished - oh god, so much blo- absolutely impeccably dressed and coutured.

My mind swirled. The cognitive dissonance I was experiencing … 

She grinned. Her muzzle was caked with gore and she licked her leonine lips with an impossibly long black tongue. All of her eyes fixed on me. 

A perfectly normal amount of eyes. Just what you’d expect. What was I thinking?

Oh, right. So anyway, we were still in my bedroom. She gently shoved me back onto my bed and began to unbutton her top. Man, she’s so beautiful. I’m so lucky. She flung her shirt to the side, revealing an impossibly sexy lacy -

Blood and bile oozed from pustules across her naked flesh. The smell of death was overpowering. We were alone on the street corner. I called for help but nothing came out of my throat. I was surrounded by her, smothered by her wings and tails, so many tails, barbed and venomous and

She pushed me down onto the bed and slowly began to kiss me. 

No! This isn’t -

She moaned softly into my ear. I shuddered. 

this isn’t real this isn’t real this isn’t real

I shut my eyes as tight as I could. Every inch of my body yearned for her, and it took all of my mental fortitude not to give in.

All three suns beamed down upon me, their warmth offering me little comfort. I felt my flesh begin to burn. I scratched idly at the itching, peeling skin, watching expressionless as chunks of meat sloughed off my arm, adding more and more viscera to the river of gore flowing down the street.

“What’s wrong?” she asked with one of her mouths. 

“Are you … afraid?” inquired another. 

“How disappointing,” murmured several at once. 

The clouds parted, revealing a bright, blood-red moon. The moon smiled enigmatically at me. 

The entity sighed. “Fear ruins everything,” she said with venom. “Told you not to be afraid. Wish you’d listened.”

Honestly, so do I. 

Nothing has been right since. The angel folded in on itself and disappeared in a shower of teeth, and the next thing I knew, I was back on Grand Avenue, my arm intact - but my mind, far from it. 

I don’t know what the creature would have done to me if the illusion hadn’t been broken, but it can’t be much worse than the living hell I’ve been stuck in since. I can’t get her out of my head - both as the seductive, perfect angel promising to fulfill all of my fantasies, and the horrifying, eldritch monstrosity that broke my brain. Any time I cross paths with someone new on the street, I feel sick. What if it’s her again? I envision them becoming an indescribable horror and for a moment find myself lost in Her web again. 

I can’t trust my own senses. Her presence awakened me to how much our eyes and ears lie to us. Every now and then I get another glance beyond the veil. How many suns are there supposed to be? My memory tells me one, that I’m daft for even questioning it, but I saw all three for myself once she broke reality. Every so often, I see the other two and feel the itch again. 

How much of that flesh-filled horror scape is reality? Are we just in some sort of Matrix that tells us we aren’t burning alive and being eaten by cosmic monsters?

Now that I write it out, it sounds ridiculous. Of course not. The creature was clearly just messing with me, showing me impossible visions. 

But she seemed genuinely concerned that I could see them. Was that, too, part of the being’s mind game? Or did I get a glance of a reality mortal minds were never meant to grasp?

I haven’t seen her since. I’m starting to miss her. 

That beautiful, perfect skin. those gorgeous pitch-black eyes, exactly where you’d expect all 17 of them to be, dotting her cavernous torso-

I failed her. She abandoned me. She gave me one simple instruction and now ill never see her again and I’ll be punished forever for my transgression

God, I miss her. Come back, my angel. 

Please. I still have one arm left to give you. 
 
I’m not afraid any more.
