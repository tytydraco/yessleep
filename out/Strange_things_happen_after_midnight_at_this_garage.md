Have you ever thought about how some roads *breathe*? Not in the metaphorical, "stretching across the land" way—no. I mean, literally breathe. Inhale. Exhale. Like they’re alive, pulsing just beneath the asphalt with something older than time and hungrier than death. Ever wonder why some roads seem to whisper, even when there’s no wind, no cars, no people—just you and that gnawing feeling that you’re not supposed to be there?

Route 47—an empty ribbon of cracked blacktop slicing through fields that seem to go on forever. Nothing but wind-warped fences, dead wheat, and the occasional skeleton of a long-abandoned barn. People around here don’t walk that road. Hell, they barely drive it after dark. And if you ask why, they won’t say much. Just glance at each other, mumble something about “the balance,” and change the subject.

I didn’t listen. I learned the hard way.

I'm a mechanic. Jack’s Garage. Twelve hours a day, six days a week. Same grease, same customers, same jokes, same coffee-stained clock ticking above the tool bench. Route 47 runs right past the lot, nothing but dust and heat shimmer by noon. For the first few years, it was just background noise. Engines humming. Tools clanking. Radios crackling with static-laced classic rock. Life was simple—until the *rules* showed up.

One night—late, sky the color of bruised fruit—I was closing up. Rolled down the bay door like I always did. That’s when Jack stopped me with one hand against the steel.

“Don’t shut it tight,” he said. Not asked—*said*. Firm. Like gravity hung on the hinge of that sentence.

I blinked. “What? Why?”

His eyes didn’t meet mine. He just tapped the metal and muttered, “Let it breathe.”

“Let *what* breathe?” I asked, forcing a laugh.

He didn’t answer. Instead, he stepped aside and pointed at the inside of the door. I stepped closer.

Long, jagged gouges stretched across the steel—deep, like something with claws had either tried to break *in*… or *get out*. I stared, and for a second—just a second—I felt a pressure in the air, like something enormous was holding its breath nearby.

From then on, I left that damn door cracked open exactly six inches. Not five. Not seven. Six. Jack said that was the balance point.

That night, I brushed it off as fatigue. Mechanics work hard, right? Maybe I was just overtired. Maybe. Still, the whole drive home along Route 47, I kept checking my rearview. No reason—just... a twitchy feeling under my skin. Then I saw them.

Headlights.

They flashed in my mirror once—twice. I looked again. Nothing there. Just the dark road stretching behind me like a mouth frozen mid-scream. My throat constricted as I forced myself to clear it, trying to shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone. I told myself it was just nerves, that sleep would fix it.

But then came the man.

Out of nowhere, a gaunt figure emerged from the shoulder of Route 47, one arm raised with a thumb pointing skyward like some broken marionette being yanked by unseen strings. He was barefoot, his feet blackened by the road. His shirt was gray, bleached by sun and sweat. His eyes—blank. As if someone had hollowed them out.

I slowed down. God knows why. Maybe pity. Maybe curiosity. Maybe something else.

“Need a ride somewhere?” I called out, leaning halfway out the window.

He stared at me for a long moment. His head tilted slightly, like he was trying to make sense of me. Then, without a word, he nodded and got in.

We didn’t exchange a single word the entire drive.

He sat perfectly still, hands in his lap, eyes forward. Like he was waiting for something. When we reached the gas station, he didn’t ask where we were. He just stepped out. Slowly. Deliberately. Then he walked behind the station and vanished into the shadows.

No thanks. No questions. Just a slow, deliberate exit—like he knew exactly where he was going, and it had nothing to do with me.

But the part that stuck with me? As I drove away, I saw him standing by the back fence, just watching. Unblinking. Like he was taking note of which direction I lived in.

Next morning? No trace. No footprints. No one remembered seeing anyone on Route 47 the night before.

I told Jack.

His face drained like someone had pulled a plug in the back of his skull. He rubbed his jaw and said something I’ll never forget:

“He’s not stuck. He *belongs* out there. If you let one in…” He paused. “Something else has to go out.”

That night, I called and called for my dog, Trixie. Sweet little mutt. Smart as a whip. Always came running when I jingled my keys.

But not this time.

She was just... gone.

Never came back.

I searched the fields. Posted signs. Nothing. Not even a scent trail. She vanished like she’d never existed.

And Route 47? It was quiet again. Balanced.

But now... every night, I leave that garage door cracked exactly six inches. I check the mirrors more often than I should. And I never—*never*—pick up hitchhikers.

Because some rides don’t end where you think they will.

And some passengers... never leave.

"And if you think that’s the strangest part of Route 47, you’re dead wrong. That was just the *beginning*. What happened *next*... still keeps me up at night."

After that night... everything changed.

Jack wasn’t the same. His eyes moved faster, hands slower—like he was trying to stay a step ahead of something invisible. He started double-checking everything. Tools. Doors. Shadows. Me. It was like the whole garage had turned into some kind of stage, and Jack was suddenly very aware we weren’t the only audience anymore.

One morning, while the sun still bled through the shop windows, Jack pointed to the tool board.

“Every wrench,” he said, “every socket, every pry bar... has its place. Its number. Its weight.”

I nodded, half-listening—until one day I noticed a wrench missing. Just one.

So, I put it back. Thought I was helping.

But Jack's expression darkened like I'd scratched at something sacred.

“You took one?” he asked, voice low and slow.

“No,” I said. “I put it back.”

His eyes didn’t blink. “On odd days,” he muttered, tapping his temple, “tools should count odd. Keeps the unseen satisfied.”

That word. *Unseen*.

I counted them after he left. Thirteen tools. Odd. Safe. But the next morning, for no reason I can explain, I moved one into the drawer. Twelve.

That night, something *fell*.

I shot upright in bed, heart hammering like a nail gun against my ribs. The sound came from inside the room. I turned on the lamp, skin crawling—and there it was.

A single wrench, cold and gleaming, lying beside my pillow.

I hadn’t brought it home.

Things escalated.

Strange customer cars began showing up—vehicles that didn’t belong to any county, state, or reality I recognized.

One day, a black sedan rolled into the lot. Noon sun overhead, but the air turned cold. No license plate. Tinted windows darker than pitch. The driver wore a hood, smooth and tight like a sack over the head. No face—just shadow. The door opened slow, careful. As if the tools themselves might rebel.

Without a word, I began the oil change.

The engine rumbled—more like a growl than a machine. His hands never touched the wheel. When I dropped the pan and slid under, the temperature around me dropped. Breath fogged in the middle of summer.

Then—*tap tap tap*—he rapped on the dash. I paused. He stared, waiting.

“The filter’s tall,” I whispered, almost to myself.

He nodded once.

I grabbed the right one, replaced it, and sealed everything back tight. No smile. No nod. He handed me two bills. A five. A one.

Six dollars.

Then he backed out—engine silent—and disappeared into the wavering heat of Route 47 like he’d been a mirage. Only he wasn’t.

I turned to clean up the spill and found Jack behind me, wiping his hands with a shop rag like he’d seen it all before.

“Odd number in,” he said, shrugging. “Odd number out.”

like it meant something. Like it was law.

I glanced at the cash on the counter. Still just two bills. A five and a one. But the receipt machine had printed $13.00.

I picked it up again. Rubbed my fingers across the paper, thinking maybe I had typed it wrong.

“You saw me enter it,” I said, almost to myself.

Jack didn’t answer. He just walked past me and started putting away tools like it was any other Tuesday. But it wasn’t.

That night, I didn’t sleep. My mind spun like a stripped bolt. The moment the sun rose, I cornered Jack by the breaker panel.

“Jack... what the hell is this?”

He didn’t speak. Just smiled, stuck his hands deep in his coveralls, and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper.

A list.

Yellowed edges. Grease stains. Like it had been passed down a long, long time.

I read the first rule.

Rule 1: Do not let them know the rules until they understand the task.

Rule 2: Never close the garage door all the way at night.

Rule 3: Don’t pick up hitchhikers. If you let one in, something else has to go out.

Rule 4: Always leave an odd number of tools on the wall.

Rule 5: Never look out the back window after midnight.

Rule 6: Always return the ratchet to the same box.

By the time I got to the last one, I knew.

I wasn’t an employee. I was a *caretaker*. This garage wasn’t a business—it was a barrier. A line between what should stay *in* and what must stay *out*.

And I was stuck here until... *They* let me leave.

So I stayed. Fixed cars. Followed rules. Watched numbers.

But one night, while replacing a timing belt in bay three, I heard it—*tapping*.

Light at first. Barely a whisper. Then harder. More frantic.

It was coming from the back window.

I checked the clock.

12:05 a.m.

Rule 5 screamed in my head.

But curiosity—stupid, human, *doomed* curiosity—dragged my feet forward.

I peeked.

And I saw it.

A *thing*. Tall. Gaunt. Its elbows bent the wrong direction, too many joints in the arms. The head swiveled far past what a neck should allow. Its mouth never stopped moving—chattering, chewing, gnawing at words I couldn’t hear.

I killed the lights. Waited in silence.

When I looked again, it was gone.

But for the next seven days, every mirror I passed—rearview, bathroom, shop wall—I saw it standing behind me.

Not moving.

Just watching.

Then came the ratchet.

I left it in a toolbox behind the bay three car. Minor slip.

The next morning, I found it sitting *outside* the box—neatly placed. Not by my hand.

Beside it: tiny boot prints. Small. Like they belonged to a nine-year-old. But they were *wrong*. Deep. Metallic. Like someone had pressed down with lead instead of flesh.

I showed Jack.

He chuckled, but his eyes stayed on those prints too long. Too still. Then he wiped them away—fast.

And that’s when I knew.

I wasn’t just being *haunted*.

Something... was *coming for me*.

Something patient. Watching. Waiting for one more mistake.

And I made it.

That night.

That *final* night...

It was storming that night.

The kind of storm where the sky doesn’t just light up—it *burns*. Thunder didn’t rumble; it *slammed*, shaking the windows like fists pounding on glass. Jack had taken his truck home hours earlier. I stayed behind, grinding through a transmission job that wouldn’t wait.

And maybe that was my real mistake—staying when I should have run.

The storm clawed at the walls. Rain battered the roof like it wanted in. The rules... they weren’t just thoughts anymore. They *weighed* on me. Heavy. Breathing down my neck like old, angry ghosts.

I checked the clock.

11:57 p.m.

I did my rounds like a ritual.

The door? Cracked six inches. Tools? Thirteen, hung just right. No hitchhikers. No mirrors. No mistakes.

I closed my eyes for one second. Just one.

And then—I heard it.

*Footsteps.*

Slow. Wet. *Inside* the shop. Behind me. On the tile.

I didn’t turn. Not right away.

“Who’s there?” I called, voice shaking but firm.

Nothing answered.

I spun and flicked the lights.

They buzzed, stuttered—then flared on.

Outside, through the wash of rain, I saw it.

The black sedan.

Parked under the yellow flicker of the lot light.

Its hooded driver sat still, motionless. Not touching the wheel. His head... turned. Staring. Not at the shop, but *into me*, like he knew I’d break a rule soon.

The headlights burned through the glass. Blinding. Knowing.

Then the lights inside the garage *flickered*. Once. Twice.

I yanked open the fuse box.

Darkness.

But lightning struck just then, and in that white-hot flash, I saw *inside* the car.

And I wished I hadn’t.

Faces.

Dozens of them—featureless, pale—pressed to the inside of the sedan’s trunk window. Or maybe not the trunk. Maybe *inside* him. No eyes. No mouths. Just smooth skin, tight against the glass in perfect rows, all *leaning* forward.

Watching.

Waiting.

I ran.

I *ran* out into the storm. Rain hit like needles. My jacket clung to my skin. I didn’t stop. I didn’t look back.

Behind me—the garage door *slammed shut*.

Hard.

Too hard.

Someone had closed it all the way.

Someone had broken *Rule #2*.

I turned.

There he was.

The hooded man, walking slowly toward the garage. Every step deliberate. Every step echoing across the concrete. Methodical.

I spun to make for my truck—but froze.

In the mirror, in the rain-streaked rearview—I saw them.

Figures.

Tall. Too tall. Thin. Shadows that stretched and bent like film negatives burning at the edges. They didn’t walk. They slid.

All moving the same way.

Toward the door.

*Toward me.*

My breath caught.

I risked one last glance at the sedan.

Empty.

The hood left on the seat.

The trunk now wide open.

A gray, gnarled hand reached out—not to escape—but to *close it*. Soft. Silent. Sealing whatever it was back inside.

I felt something brush my ankle.

I looked down.

A wrench.

One I swore I’d already stored.

*Fourteen.*

Even.

Wrong.

I didn’t need to count the rest. I didn’t need more signs.

The rules were never meant to protect *me*.

They were to protect *them*—from whatever wanted in.

They needed *my obedience*. My blind, unblinking compliance.

And I failed.

I jumped in my truck and floored it.

Tires screamed. Water peeled from the pavement. The garage shrank in the mirror, swallowed by rain and night. I didn’t look back. I *couldn’t* look back.

I just drove.

Until morning.

And when I finally dared return to Jack’s?

It was gone.

No lights. No tools. Just a building sealed like a crypt.

The door was welded shut, scorched edges and all.

And scrawled across it in thick, black grease:

COUNT. ODD. BREATHE. DON’T LOOK.

Nothing else.

Just that.

A warning.

Or maybe... a promise.

Now?

I live in Tulsa.

Tiny apartment. No mirrors. No windows open. I’ve got a drawer full of tools—thirteen wrenches, fifteen sockets. All *odd*.

I never go near Route 47.

But when the thunder rolls and I catch a flicker in my reflection—something tall, with the wrong elbows—I know.

They’re still out there.

Sliding through the dark.

Waiting for someone else to forget.

Because the truth is this:

If you don’t follow the rules... something else will follow you.
