I was cooking dinner and didn't feel like washing my hands ten thousand times to pick up the phone. I've become too lazy for most tasks, but I have technology to thank for that.

I was alone in the house. For context, I live in a small cabin surrounded by some woods. The next house is a ten minute walk from here, so I'm not so isolated. Still, at night it gets pretty quiet. I'm saying this in order for you to understand that there were no other sounds outside for the phone to pick up. The whole house was silent, apart from my voice and the sounds I made while cooking.

I was texting my friend about some trip to the mountains. He'd asked me if I was going to bring my tent, to which I replied: "Yeah, I am."

He texted back a minute later: *I didn't ask you where you were lol*

I blinked a few times, reading the text from the lit up screen. What did he mean? I checked my text, which said "Yeah, I am here."

I hadn't dictated the last word. Of course, I didn't initially think something weird was going on.

I dictated back "I meant I was bringing the tent, I don't know why it picked up here. I'm using voice to text, sorry"

I checked to see if the phone wrote the message correctly, and it had.

Ten minutes later, I'd told Bryan (my friend) that I didn't want to bring my shotgun, but I would if I had to.

He texted back *What?*

I frowned and left my pan on the stove to check what I'd written before.

*I don't wanna bring my shotgun, but she's here.*

Was that some type of autocorrect? Some function to fill in sentences? AI?

"I don't know what's up with my phone, sorry."

*I don't know what's up with my phone, she's standing by the sink, sorry.*

*WHO is standing by the sink??????*

I looked up to the sink. No one was there, and yet the sound of oil sizzling had been turned by my paranoia into the sound of someone breathing.

"No one! My fucking autocorrect is acting up."

*No one! Don't open the oven*

*Are you fucking with me dude? It's funny. Are you bringing your shotgun or not?*

I glared at the oven. Should I check? I didn't really want to. "I'll call you after I'm done." I dictated.

*I'll call you after I'm done. She's almost done.*

*Who the fuck is she?????*

My throat was dry. I turned off the stove and washed my hands, absently wiping them with the towel, while staring at the oven. I grabbed the phone. I still wanted to see if it would pick up something else, so I tried, one last time: "I don't know."

The phone picked up *She wants to come out of the oven now.*

My heart stopped. My legs searched desperately for the fastest way upstairs, almost tripping, and I basically crawled to my bedroom, where I called Bryan and told him what had happened. He figured that I was just freaked out about living alone for so long, in the woods, and offered to pick me up and drive me to his place. I reluctantly agreed. When he arrived, I sprinted past the kitchen and got into the car. He thought that the whole thing was funny, but I couldn't bring myself to smile back.

While we were talking on the phone, I'd heard the oven ding [downstairs.](https://www.reddit.com/user/EmmaWatsonButDumber/)
