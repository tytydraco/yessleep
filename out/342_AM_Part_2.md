I'm writing this from my car outside a 24-hour diner where I've been since 4 AM. Mia thinks I got an early start to drive to my parents' house a few hours away. She doesn't know I have no intention of going there and putting them at risk.

It's 3:41 PM now. In twelve hours, it will be 3:41 AM, and a minute after that...

I don't know what's happening to me. I don't know if I'm experiencing some kind of mental break or if there's actually something following me. All I know is that child saw something I couldn't, and children don't make up very specific details like tall men whispering in people's ears.

The diner's fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as I stared into my sixth cup of coffee. My hands trembled, partly from the caffeine, partly from fear. I couldn't keep this up. The sleep deprivation was starting to take its toll—my thoughts scattered like roaches when exposed to light, and the edges of reality seemed to waver when I blinked too slowly.

"Refill, hon?" The waitress held the coffee pot, eyeing the dark circles under my eyes with concern.

I shook my head. "Actually, can you tell me where the nearest hospital is?"

Thirty minutes later, I was explaining my situation to a triage nurse who kept glancing at the clock like she had somewhere better to be.

"So you wake up at exactly the same time every night?" she asked, typing notes without looking at me.

"Yes. 3:42 AM. On the dot. For eight nights straight."

"And you believe something... supernatural is causing this?"

I hesitated. Said aloud, it sounded absurd. "I don't know what's causing it. That's why I'm here. I need someone to figure out what's happening to me."

Three hours, two doctors, and countless skeptical looks later, I was admitted for overnight observation. The attending physician, Dr. Mercer, had the decency to hide his disbelief behind medical terminology.

"Sleep disruption can have many causes," he explained. "Stress, anxiety, environmental factors. We'll monitor your brain activity overnight and see if we can identify any abnormalities."

The sleep lab technician was more blunt as she attached electrodes to my scalp. "You know, lots of people report waking up at 3 AM. Some call it the devil's hour—when the veil between worlds is thinnest." She smiled, clearly thinking she was humoring me. "Though you're specific about 3:42."

"It's not approximately 3:42," I said, my voice tight. "It's exactly 3:42. Every single night."

She patted my arm condescendingly. "Well, we'll be monitoring you all night. Try to relax."

As if relaxation was possible when you knew something would be visiting you in the dark.

I lay rigidly in the hospital bed, staring at the clock: 11:37 PM. The room was clinical and cold, nothing like my apartment. Maybe whatever had attached itself to me wouldn't find me here, surrounded by machines and separated from the rest of the hospital by thick walls specially designed for sleep studies.

Despite my fear, exhaustion eventually won out. The last thing I remembered was the clock reading 12:14 AM.

I woke to darkness and the familiar racing of my heart.

3:42 AM.

The monitoring equipment beeped steadily beside me, but something was wrong. The room felt pressurized, like the moment before a storm breaks. And it was too dark—the small status lights on the machines should have provided at least some illumination.

A soft scratching sound came from the corner of the room. Not like nails on a surface, but like something writing—a pencil moving rapidly across paper.

"Hello?" I whispered.

The scratching stopped.

The darkness in the corner seemed to deepen, to coalesce into something denser than the surrounding shadows. I couldn't make out a form exactly, but I had the distinct impression of height, of something tall unfolding itself.

The smell hit me then—that same burnt odor, but stronger now, mixed with something sulfurous. My throat constricted.

"We're recording this," I said, my voice shaking. "The machines are documenting everything."

A low sound filled the room—not quite a laugh, but an expression of amusement nonetheless. The temperature plummeted. My breath clouded in front of me.

Then the pressure in the room changed, my ears popping painfully as whatever presence had been there seemed to recede. The status lights on the equipment blinked back on. The darkness returned to normal darkness.

I sat frozen until a nurse burst into the room.

"Are you alright? Your heart rate spiked and your brain activity went haywire." She flipped on the light, flooding the room with harsh fluorescence.

"Did you see it? Did the cameras record it?" I demanded.

She frowned. "Record what?"

"The... presence. In the corner. The temperature dropped. Didn't you feel it?"

The nurse checked my pulse, her expression shifting to one I was becoming all too familiar with—clinical concern masking judgment.

"I'll get the doctor," she said.

Dr. Mercer arrived looking rumpled and irritated at being woken. He reviewed the readouts from the machines with increasing perplexity.

"This is... unusual," he admitted. "You experienced a sudden drop into deep sleep, followed by an immediate jump to a highly alert state precisely at 3:42 AM. Your stress hormones spiked, but there's no apparent reason for it." He looked at me. "What do you think triggered this response?"

"I told you. Something was in the room with me."

"The cameras didn't show anything," the nurse interjected. "I checked the feed."

Dr. Mercer rubbed his eyes. "Ms. Khoury, your brain scans don't show any sign of seizure activity or other neurological issues. However, these patterns are consistent with extreme terror responses. I'd like to refer you to our psychiatric department in the morning."

"You think I'm making this up?" I felt tears of frustration burning behind my eyes.

"I think you're experiencing something very real to you," he said carefully. "But we need to consider psychological causes."

They gave me a mild sedative and left me alone, though I noticed they left the light on and the door slightly ajar, as if I were a child afraid of the dark.

I didn't sleep again.

In the morning, a psychiatrist with a soft voice and carefully neutral expression asked me about my history with anxiety, depression, and trauma. She suggested medication, therapy, and followup appointments. What she didn't suggest was belief in my experience.

"Sometimes the mind creates external threats to process internal stress," she explained gently. "The specific time could have significance you're not consciously aware of."

I nodded and accepted the prescriptions she wrote, knowing I wouldn't fill them. The medical establishment had failed me. Whatever was happening existed outside their instruments and understanding.

I checked out of the hospital against medical advice. If science couldn't help me, perhaps other knowledge could.

The occult bookshop was tucked between a vape store and a laundromat, its windows dusty and lined with crystals that refracted the afternoon sunlight. The woman behind the counter had silver hair and eyes that seemed to look through me rather than at me.

"Can I help you find something?" she asked.

"I need information about... entities that might visit at specific times. Particularly at night."

She didn't laugh or look skeptical, which was refreshing after the hospital. "The hours between 3 and 4 AM are often called the witching hour, or the devil's hour," she said. "The time when the veil is thinnest and malevolent entities are strongest."

My heart quickened. "What about 3:42 specifically?"

Something shifted in her expression. "Numbers have power. Specific times can be significant to specific entities, especially those with... intentions."

I spent two hours in that shop, leaving with books on protective rituals, demonology, and a bag of coarse sea salt that the owner had pressed into my hands.

"Salt the thresholds," she'd instructed. "Cover the mirrors. Create a circle around where you sleep. It might not stop it, but it will slow it down until you understand what you're dealing with."

Back in my apartment, I moved with frantic purpose. I poured thick lines of salt across every doorway, every window sill. I took down mirrors and covered the bathroom mirror with a sheet. I read passages about devils and demons, about entities that feed on fear and isolation, that start with minute intrusions before consuming their targets entirely.

One passage in particular chilled me: "Devils often begin with temporal hauntings—claiming specific moments rather than spaces. The entity creates a pattern of manifestation, training its target to anticipate and fear these encounters, growing stronger with each visitation until it can fully materialize through you."

As evening approached, I created a perfect circle of salt around my bed. I placed In each corner of the room, hand-drawn symbols on torn pieces of parchment. The north held a pentacle, the five-pointed star enclosed in a circle for protection and balance. In the east, I set the Eye of Horus, its gaze meant to guard against unseen forces. The south bore the Algiz rune—ᛉ—an ancient symbol of defense. And in the west, I placed a Seal of Solomon, its interlocking triangles meant to bind and repel spirits.. I did everything the books suggested, knowing how crazy it all seemed but beyond caring.

I set my phone to record video, positioning it to capture my bed and most of the room. Then I waited, sitting cross-legged in the center of my salt circle, determined to face whatever came at 3:42 AM.

Despite my resolution, I must have dozed off, because I jolted awake to find someone sitting at the edge of my bed.

The clock read 3:41 AM.

It was a man—luminous and tall in the darkness, with serene eyes and an aura of calm. Unlike the burnt smell of my nightly visitor, his presence carried a faint scent of morning dew.

"Who are you?" I gasped, pressing back against the headboard.

"Don't be afraid," he said, his voice gentle yet resonant. "I've come to help you against what hunts you."

I stared at him, wondering if my desperate efforts had finally yielded results. Perhaps my plight hadn't gone unnoticed after all. Those symbols I'd carefully placed around the room—maybe they had done their work, summoning this protector just when I needed him most.

"There isn't much time," he said, his voice carrying an odd resonance, like multiple voices speaking in perfect harmony. "They've marked you. They're coming through the gateway you've unwittingly provided."

"What? What gateway? I don't understand—"

"The time—3:42—it's significant. It's when—"

He stopped suddenly, his form flickering like a bad transmission. His expression changed to one of alarm.

"They're coming. The salt won't hold them. You need to—"

He vanished mid-sentence as the clock turned to 3:42 AM.

The salt at the edge of my circle began to blacken, as if being scorched by invisible flames. The protective symbols at the corners of my room burst into actual flame, burning with unnatural brightness before turning to ash.

Then I saw it, or part of it—a tall, impossibly thin silhouette standing just beyond the fading salt circle. It had no features I could discern, just an absence darker than the surrounding darkness, but I could feel it smiling.

"Every night, you've given me one minute," a whisper came from everywhere and nowhere. "Tonight, I take two."

The digital clock on my nightstand flicked from 3:42 to 3:43, and unlike previous nights, the presence remained. Something cold brushed against my cheek, like fingers made of ice.

I screamed, scrambling backward until I hit the wall. The touch withdrew, but the presence remained, watching.

As 3:44 AM clicked onto my nightstand clock, the dark presence vanished, leaving me alone and shaking in my room.

I scrambled for my phone, checking the recording with trembling fingers. Like before, the video showed static during the exact period of the visitation—now two minutes instead of one. But just before the static cleared, a single frame showed something that made my blood freeze: the dark silhouette standing at the foot of my bed, impossibly tall, its head almost touching the ceiling. And beside my bed, just barely visible, the outline of the tall man with his hand outstretched protectively.

I knew then that the old woman at the bookshop had been right. What was happening to me wasn't a mental break. It wasn't carbon monoxide or temporal lobe seizures.

Something had found me, marked me. A devil that was methodically claiming more of my time, minute by minute, claiming my essence, my soul, my very existence.

But something else had interfered tonight. Someone that, for reasons I couldn't fathom, seemed to be protecting me.

I needed to find out more about both entities. I needed to understand why I had been chosen, and how to end this nightmare before the devil claimed not just minutes, but hours. Before it claimed me entirely.

And I had less than 24 hours before 3:42 AM came again.
