 

Mr. Truths is a myth, folktale if you will, a spooky story to tell around a campfire. The tale goes as follows: one day, a demon rose from Hell and changed his appearance to be an old man who wanders down the roads and woods to tell people the indisputable truth about something that would break their reality. This truth was so devastating that it would often send someone into an insanity fueled rampage. And that's it, the tale ends there, a camp counselor would jump from the woods wearing a mask and say some bullshit to scare the kids.

But I have found a small group who say this Mr. Truths is real and you can summon him to your house. This group is bullshit, everything they say is not to be listened to, they are just a bunch of 30 somethings, still living in their mothers house with nothing better to do. I'm getting off topic, but there was one of these guys that I decided to humor and he was the one who told me that they weren't lying but they also couldn’t help anyone who wanted to talk to Mr. Truths.

He did, however, point me to a person who could help. I decided to humor him even more and went to message this guy. This guy told me that to do this I would have to be utterly serious and not joke around with it. So I said I was super serious while I had a huge grin on my face, not because I was gonna talk to this imaginary demon but because I was just about to prove how wrong these guys were. He had to clarify a few things with me. He said that there was a lot wrong with the modern day version. According to him, Mr. Truths has been around since there were words. He told me this 

“Mr. Truths is a demon but he didn’t rise from hell on his own, he was banished. And he doesn't just walk around as just an old man, he changes it up. He’s just most commonly an old man. He also doesn’t walk around, you have to call him, camps just make that up so they can get a good scare out of you, another thing is, he doesn't tell just a random truth, he tells what you ask but be careful what you ask for each question pushed you further to insanity. If you want to really call him, follow these instructions to the tee.”

I was still having fun and I decided to humor these guys one last time, but this time I would come to regret it. He sent me the instructions and they are: 

* Wait till midnight
* Turn off all electronics(including lights) at exactly midnight
* Then sit in a 5 ft circle of empty space
* Then you want to light a candle and place it as close to the center of said circle then stand back, at this moment a bright flash of light should consume the room
* Once that has gone away and you see your pitch black room, the candle should be extinguished
* If the candle is extinguished walk outside and find the closest public place to sit, whether that be a restaurant or a park bench
* If the candle is not extinguished, turn all lights back on and hope he’s not already there
* After you are done with Mr. Truths say the phrase “that's true” and he will leave

I wanted to follow through with it but it was past midnight and I wanted to prove how wrong these guys are. I waited till the next day and set up my camera and sat around and watched a movie until midnight. When the clock hit midnight I walked to my breaker and turned off the electricity to every room and went back to my living room to move my couch. Once I had done that, I sat down and lit the candle. It wasn’t anything special, just a dollar store candle. I then sat there waiting for something to happen, I then thought I hadn’t put it close enough to the center and nudged it further away from me.

Just as I did this a bright flash filled the room for a split second and now sitting here on my floor, with the candle extinguished. I stood up and fumbled my way to my door. I opened it and walked to the closest place which was a local restaurant that was just down the street. I got a table and sat down. It was a rainy night, nothing bad but definitely wet. I sat at the table and looked out the window waiting for something to happen. When I looked back towards the reception area I saw no worker but I did see a man walking towards me. This man was wearing a hoodie, tattered jeans, and sneakers. His hood was up so I couldn’t see his face. He sat down in front of me and said nothing.

I asked with stunned disbelief “are you Mr. Truths?” He said nothing but I saw flashes of people all asking the same thing as me, and when I came back he was holding up one finger. I then asked “What is the truth about existence?” Once more, he said no words, and I saw flashes of people being born, living their lives, then dying. The words were put in my mouth “live, work, die, repeat”. He was holding up two fingers now. I then asked “What is the truth about my life?” I saw flashes of a life like any other, office job, low salary, and working till I die.

I then had a light bulb click “what is the truth about you?” this time he had a response, just not verbal. He smiled. I then saw flashes of Hell, a demon getting shoved around, then lashing out and disobeying orders. He was then thrown from Hell and walking a forest as an old man, then it was just a bunch of rapid flashes of people like me throughout time. I had one more question “what is the truth about truths?” his smile fell away and now I heard a voice but it wasn’t mine, and it wasn’t a worker. It was his. He said

“The truth about Truths is that they corrupt, they fester, they seep through the smallest of cracks and they do no good. Even if it seems like a good truth it is not. Truths can end nations, collapse the world and bring down a species if the right truth is told. I am just a container of all Truths and everyone else is just opening said container to take a peek, it not my fault they don’t like what they see, just a matter of circumstance, and I’ll say it again; the truth about Truths is that I am corrupt” and with that I looked away from him and out the window, to notice the rain had stopped, not that it had gone away but it was frozen in place, time had stopped.

"What is the Truth about the range of your power?” I asked with a shaking breath. He showed me one image, it was of the world cracked clean down the middle. He was holding up five fingers and I could feel my sanity slipping so I said “That's true” and he put his hand down and walked off. After he was out of sight the worker had returned and the rain started again. I asked for a burger, ate, and went home.

It's been days since then and I can't get these things I've been told out of my head. He was right;

Truths really does corrupt.
