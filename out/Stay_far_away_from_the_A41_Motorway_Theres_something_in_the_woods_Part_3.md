"Are you sure this is a good idea?" Mei's voice wavers.  
"It's the only idea I have," I reply, attempting to sound more resolute than I feel.  
As we maneuver through the labyrinth of trees, the forest appears to close in around us, the path ahead growing more indistinct with each step. The feeble beam of the flashlight casts elongated shadows, turning the gnarled branches into twisted phantoms that seem to reach out for us.  
The forest is alive with unseen movements, and I can't shake the feeling that something is watching us from the shadows.  
"I hate this," Mei's whisper is barely audible over the symphony of the night. "Do you think there's something out here?"  
I don’t know what to say to her.  
The flashlight catches something ahead. A flicker of warmth amidst the cold shadows.  
"It's a camp, or what's left of it," Mei observes.  
Indeed, before us lies a makeshift camp, abandoned and weathered by time. Tattered tarps are strung between trees. The air carries the faint scent of extinguished campfires and damp earth.  
A few meters away, we spot a collection of tools strewn on the forest floor – a rusted saw, a weathered hammer, and a broken shovel. An old campfire pit sits in the center, its ashes long cold. Discarded cans and food wrappers are scattered around.  
"I wonder who built this and why".  
"Maybe someone got lost like us. Tried to create a sense of normalcy," I speculate.  
The flashlight flickers momentarily, casting eerie shadows on the trees. After all the hunger and lack of sleep, I'm not sure if it's not just my imagination.  
"Let's keep moving."  
The air is heavy, filled with the unsettling sounds of rustling leaves and distant whispers. Suddenly, a primal scream pierces the silence.  
Before we can react, a wild figure emerges from the shadows, his eyes wide and filled with terror.  
It’s an old man, his beard unkempt and matted. His tattered clothes hang loosely on his emaciated frame, giving him a feral appearance. In one hand, he clutches a rusty, weather-beaten gun, pointing it at us as.  
The language he spews is an incoherent torrent, Italian syllables dripping with dread. We stand frozen.  
"Non capiamo!" I plead. “Please don't shoot. We need help.”  
The old man's gaze dances between us, his trembling hands clenching the relic of a firearm.  
"Per favore, per favore," Mei implores, her palms open in surrender.   
The old man watches us with the suspicion of a creature at the edge of the abyss.   
"Easy, easy," I murmur.  
With a nod, I motion toward the path. The old man's eyes follow our movements. In a moment of unsettling quiet, he turns away, his footsteps retreating into the shadows he emerged from.  
We stand there for a long moment, the silence stretching between us like a taut wire. My heart's still racing, pounding against my chest as if trying to break free. I can feel Mei's eyes on me, wide and questioning, but I'm not ready to meet them yet.  
"Who was he?" Mei's voice is barely above a whisper.  
I shake my head, trying to clear it. "I don't know. Lost, like us, maybe? Maybe he's been out here too long, turned feral."  
"I can't shake the feeling that he's seen things, horrible things."   
"Yeah. But what? What's happening here?"  
I keep replaying the old man's terror-stricken eyes, the way his hands trembled. He looked like he'd been in these woods for a lifetime, haunted and broken.  
As we trudge along, a sudden rustling in the bushes startles us. Instinctively, I reach out, holding Mei back. A deer emerges, its eyes glinting in the flashlight's beam. It regards us calmly, then, as if deciding we're not a threat, it gracefully leaps away, disappearing into the darkness.  
"The first living thing we've seen that isn't trying to kill us," Mei remarks. I force a smile, but inside, I'm a tangle of nerves.  
We keep moving. The forest seems endless, a never-ending loop of trees and shadows. Every step feels heavier, every breath a labor. My mind races with questions, but no answers come.  
Hours pass—or maybe it's just minutes; time has lost all meaning in this place. And then, as suddenly as we had left it, the motorway appears again.  
The same gray asphalt, the same reflectors twinkling like indifferent stars, all bathed in the eerie glow of the moon  
We approach the motorway, each step heavy with apprehension.  
"Impossible," I mutter.  
"This can't be happening," Mei whispers. "We walked straight... we should have ended up somewhere else, anywhere else!"  
Mei slumps onto the pavement.  
"This can't be real. This can't."  
I want to inject some optimism into the situation, to spur her into action, but the absurdity of our predicament silences me. Instead, I simply sit down beside her, sharing in the moment of despair.  
"How long do you think that old man has been trapped here?" I muse, more to myself than to Mei.  
"I don't know. Weeks? Months? He looked like he lost his mind."  
I nod, considering her words.  
"What if he decides to confront us... maybe when we're asleep?"  
"I doubt it," I counter. "He seemed more scared of us than we are of him."  
"But he has a gun.”  
"Yeah, and if only we understood what he was trying to say..."  
"A crash course in Italian would've been useful about now..."  
I suddenly realize something. "You know, he might not have been here that long."  
"Why do you think that?"  
"The vending machine at the gas station. If he had been here for a long time, he would've emptied it."  
"Unless he chose not to use it," she suggests.  
"Or ran out of coins," I say, and Mei lets out a small, strained laugh.  
"But even if he didn't want the vending machine food, how has he been surviving?" she wonders aloud.  
"Hunting, probably?”  
"Yeah, maybe." Mei pulls her knees closer to her chest. "If only we could use his camp. We'd have a fire to warm us, we could boil water, drink tea… What if this is it, Finn? What if we're stuck here forever?"  
"No," I say firmly, placing a hand on her shoulder. "There has to be a reason for all this. A way out. We just haven't found it yet."  
I try to sound more confident than I feel, but Mei's despair is contagious. The silence between us stretches, filled with the unspoken fear that we might really be stuck in this nightmarish loop forever.  
"We should keep moving," I finally say, breaking the silence. "Staying in one place isn't going to help us figure this out."  
Mei lifts her head, wiping away tears that have started to form. "You're right," she says, her voice steadier now. "We can't give up. Not yet."  
We stand up, our bodies stiff from sitting on the hard pavement. As we continue down the motorway, I keep replaying our encounter with the old man in my mind, searching for any clue he might have unwittingly given us.  
The road seems endless, but the act of moving, of doing something, anything, helps lift the oppressive weight of hopelessness, if only slightly.  
After what feels like hours, we find our car parked close to the bus. We drive it back to the gas station.  It's like a beacon in the night, both reassuring and maddening in its familiarity. We approach it, half-expecting something to have changed, but it's exactly as we left it.  
"I’ll use the toilet while we’re here," Mei says.  
She wanders off towards the bio-toilet stall, her silhouette gradually blending into the shadows. I sit there, lost in thought, staring at the empty vending machine, contemplating our next move.  
Moments later, I sense a presence behind me. Startled, I turn around to find Mei standing there. "You're back already?" I ask, surprised at how quickly she seems to have returned.  
Mei looks at me, puzzled. "I didn't go anywhere. I've been here the whole time."  
"But you just said you were going to the toilet..."  
"No, I didn't."  
I try to make sense of it. Had I imagined her saying that? The stress and the fatigue could be playing tricks on my mind. But it felt so real.  
"I heard you clearly, Mei. You said you needed to use the toilet and walked off in that direction." I point towards the bio-toilet stall.  
"Finn, I've been sitting right here. I didn’t say anything about the toilet. Are you sure you're okay?"  
I run a hand through my hair, trying to piece it together. "I... I don't know. Maybe I'm just tired, or maybe this place is getting to me."  
If I was hallucinating, what else might I see or hear that isn't real? Or worse, was there someone – or something – else out here with us, mimicking Mei?  
"Let's stick together," I say. "No wandering off, even for a minute."  
Mei nods in agreement, her face etched with concern.
