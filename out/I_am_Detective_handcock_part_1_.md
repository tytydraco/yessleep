“I am Detective Hancock. I'm here with Detective Isaiah Toadvine and Ms. Cindy Tallulah. It's 2:36 pm Tuesday October 19th.” 

He sat the recorder down on the polished hardwood table. “Can we get you anything?” Hancock said to the young girl sitting across the table from the two men. She just shook her head from side to side. She was looking at the ground but you could still see her eyes were red and puffy from crying.”Why don't you start from the beginning.”  Tell us every detail no matter how small.

Hancock tried to give a comforting smile. He nudged detective Isaiah and raised his eyebrows. Isaiah got the message and made an attempt at coping Hancock's smile. “Why me?” “Why do I have to tell you what happened?” 

Hancock let out a long sigh. “It looks like you were the only one of your family whose blindfold came off.”  “We think you are the only one of your family who saw what really happened.” Cindy started to quietly sob into her hands. Hancock ran his hand through his thinning salt and pepper hair. He turned to Isaiah and gave him a helpless look. Isaiah just shrugged his shoulders and stared back stupidly. With a look that said; what do you want me to do?

Finally after a few moments of uncomfortable silence. Isaiah spoke in his gruff voice. “Listen, we really need your help.” There is a man dead and a man missing. “They're gone!” she shouted from the other side of the table making eye contact for the first. Her eyes seemed to look straight through them. Stunned Hancock stamred “wha- what do you mean gone”

“You wont believe me.” “no one will ever believe what I saw”

Please let us try and understand,Handcock said. His voice was low and pleading. Sometimes trauma can make us misremember things. Isaiah and I have been to the scene and… Hancock trailed off for a moment. “I've never seen anything like it.” “We are very open to whatever you have to say.” The girl just sat there, tears slowly running down her face, slashing onto the table.

All three sat there for a while. Cindy’s raven hair hung down around her face. Her skin was a sort of cinnamon color with bright green eyes. Like the sun shining through a leaf. The silence started to weigh too heavily on the men.Then Isaiah shared a look with Hancock and closed the manila folder on the table in front of him.  With a somber look both men started to stand and push in their chairs.

“We were taking a family trip.” Cindy spoke before the men could turn to leave. “My seventeenth birthday is friday. My grandparents live in Silver City and they wanted to throw me a birthday party. It’s a long drive so we were going to stay the weekend there and come back on sunday.”

“You and your family live in Los Alamos right? Isaiah asked matter of factly 

“Just outside of it, yes. We packed the van and got on the road early that morning.
We drove about three hours before we stopped for gas and lunch. My little brother had pestered me the entire ride. Cindy let out a short laugh and smiled at the thought of her brother. My mother had said we should try and get along. She said we would miss these trips one day. After all this when I get home I don't think I ever want to leave again. My dad asked us what we wanted to eat. My brother never looked up from his tablet. I just shrugged my shoulders. "Hamburgers it is then" he said as he walked in the building.

He came back out with a plastic bag filled with tin foil lumps.  He gave one to each of us and then went to fill the van with gas. I opened up the lump of foil to find a flattened room temp burger. Or something that resembled a burger. I let out a long sigh and looked out the window. Out in an open field next to the building sat a woolley black dog. Sitting perfectly still just watching the people come and go. I pulled my burger into two pieces and headed toward the dog. My mother called out the window. “Don't wander too far. We are back on the road as soon as the van is full.”

“The dog didn't move a muscle as I got close to it. I started to wonder if it was real.  “Here boy, I got something for you.” I said holding the piece of burger out to him. At least I thought it might be a him. He just sat there not moving, staring back at me. Suddenly he made a huff noise with his long slender nose and I jumped slightly. I held my position crouched a few feet in front of him with the piece of meat and bread held out. He reluctantly took a step forward and gently took my offering and in two bites it was gone. Then he sat back down and gave me this look as if to say, there you are happy now.? He looked black except for a white tear drop shape on his chest just below his neck. 

Hancock had stopped writing on his notepad. He didn't see how this dog had anything to do with the incident but it had took some doing to get this girl to talk. So he just sat there quietly and hung onto every word. Isaiah sat looking down at the table mostly. Every once and a while he would meet Cindy’s gaze. The man was a brilliant detective but he was a little socially awkward. The older Hancock had become his partner two years ago and he didn't mind doing most of the talking and this made the two a good pair.

I turned and walked back to the van and opened the sliding door. I knew right away something was off. My mother and father sat straight up in the seats. They were rigid and looking straight ahead.My brother wasn't in his seat  

“Wheres-”

Suddenly I was forced to the floorboard of the van. I felt cold metal on the back of my neck.
“Don't fucking move and Don't make a sound”  i whimpered as my face was pressed hard against the carpet floorboard.  I pulled the rest of the way into the van. The sliding door was shut and the stranger turned to my dad and said drive around back. I could now see that the metal I felt on the back of my neck was a shiny revolver. He put the revolver to the back of my dads head.

“Ok,ok please just don't hurt anyone.” My dad said as he pulled the van into gear. 

The stranger had a mask pulled up over his mouth and nose. The kind that a motorcycle rider might wear. It had the mouth of a skeleton printed on the front with gold teeth. I turned my head slightly and saw my brother laying on the floorboard in the third row of the van. Sitting in the third row seat was another stranger I hadn't noticed when I walked up. 

We drove around to the back of the building where another man was waiting. He was holding a duffle bag. All three men wore similar masks. The skeleton prints were just slightly different. The skeleton mouth printed on the man’s mask in the backseat with my brother was cartoonish. Sort of like a skeleton from an old disney cartoon. The man with the duffle bag’s mask had an unnaturally large smile filled with sharp jagged teeth.

“Could you tell us anything about how men looked, " Hancock interrupted. Were there any face or hand tattoos? Were they short or tall? 

“It all happened so fast I couldn't tell much about them. As soon as the van stopped they took all of us out of the van. They laid the seats down blind folded all of us. Then bound our hands and feet.  They laid us all down in the back and they were driving us out in probably less than five minutes.”

Isaiah looked at Hancock. “It looks like they have a lot of practice at this. There have been disappearances all over the state. They didn't  seem related but these could be our guys.”

“Don't get too excited now son. Lets get all the facts. Please continue Ms.Tallulah.”

“I don't think we were in the car for a very long time but it felt like hours. I cried so much and so did my brother. My dad reached out to us and whispered that everything was going to be ok.” I wanted to believe him but I had never been so afraid. Finally the van stopped and I heard it go into park. Then one of them spoke.”

“So here's what's going to happen. The wife,girl and boy are going to hang out here with my friends. Me and Poppa bear here are going to the bank. He is going to calmly make a nice withdrawal for my friends and I. Then you will be reunited and get on with your lives.”

The man spoke calmly and clearly. As if this were an ordinary business meeting in a comfy air conditioned office. Rather than a man sitting behind the wheel of a stolen vehicle filled with four hostages.

“The sliding door opened and I was pulled onto the ground. When my back hit the ground my blindfold fell off. Before they were able to pull the cloth back over my eyes. I saw an old metal building. Like an abandoned warehouse or something. Sitting on the roof of the building. Was a huge bird. A vulture I think. It had a white patch on its chest just like the dog had seen right before we were taken. The blindfold was roughly pulled back up over my eyes. Then they forced us all to our feet and marched us in the warehouse.”

So they held you,your mother and brother in the warehouse. While one of them left with your father for the bank. Do I have all that right? Hancock said scribing quicking in his notebook.  

“Yes, we were taken to a small room. I felt the floor change from concrete to carpet. I was pushed to the floor and told to lay face down and not move. This room was brighter than the hollow warehouse that we walked through. I thought it must be a small office or something.”

“In the statement we took from your father. He stated that he was left laying in the back of the van and driven to the bank. He said he couldn't be sure about the trip to the bank. He said he  thought it took about two hours. Does that sound right?” Hancock asked

“Umm I guess so.” Cindy shrugged looking at the ground. “It felt like a lot longer than that in some ways and in others everything felt so fast.

"Take us through what happened while you were in the room. Everything you heard, smelled and saw after the blindfold was off."

"So we just laid there for a long time. on the floor together. My mom held us and whispered to both of us everything was going to be ok. I started to take notice of a conversation going on between the two men watching us."

"What the fuck is taking so long?" I'm not sure where the closest bank is and you know sometimes they ask questions about large amounts. The first voice was older than the second. Maybe middle aged. The second voice was younger and quieter. He barely spoke above a whisper. "Marco needs to hurry the fuck up." Hey man keep your voice down and no names. Yeah we don't want the mice to hear us." They will be the only ones left alive to identify us "the men moved closer to the family laying on the floor.

  "Maybe I will pass the time with the girl." The older man brushes the back of his hand on the young girls arm.

"I don't think you should do this man."

"This warning went unheeded as I was dragged out of the room. In the struggle my blindfold came off and I was face to face with the man that wore the skeleton mask with gold teeth. I sturrgged and cried but my cries were dwarfed by another sound. My mother whaled and pleaded. She begged for the man to take her instead. Her cries shook me to my very soul. I suddenly felt less afraid of my fate and more sorrowful that I couldn't comfort my mother."

"The warehouse was dark. I was roughly plopped onto a table of some sort. The man started to pull at my clothes and I felt his sour breathon my neck. I sturrgged against him and he stuck me hard across the face. I laid there for a moment seeing stars. Even though the light was dim I could see the man's mask was down. His top front four teeth were gold plated. I felt him unbutton my jeans. I closed my eyes tightly and braced for the worst. I laid there rigid for a full minute but felt no more advances. When I open my eyes there was no one there."

I looked around the large dark empty room but there was no one in sight. An exit door slammed against it's frame on the other end of the building. I got up off the table and thought about running for help. When the door to what I could now see was a small office flung open.

Hey man please dont-

The man In the cartoonish skull mask stopped in his tracks. 

"Where is he?" I don't know I stammered.  "He's just gone" the man pointed the sliver revolver from before at me. "Get back in the room now!" With no sure escape and confused about what was going on. I walked past the man back in the room. The man pushed me onto the floor and said not to move. When he grabbed me to shove me down I could feel his hands shaking with fear.

He took out his cell phone and began to call someone.  I lay on the floor and swore I could hear a faint sound getting louder  after a moment the sounds became louder and clearer. It sounds like an old rotary phone ringing. Suddenly a vent in the overhead air conditioning vents flew open and a smart phone fell right out in front of the man. The phone was speckled with blood and it rang as the man looked from his phone to the one laying in front of him in utter shock. 

"He stood there speechless. Then something burst through the window and landed on the ground. It was a few feet from the man and right at my feet. It was a bloody mass and it hit the floor with a disgusting plop. The mass began to move and suddenly it became obvious it was man. A man that had been skinned alive. The mass on the ground started to move." It's eyes bulged from its skull.

"What the fuck is that" a blast smacked my ear drums and left them ringing. The figure on the ground groaned and I could see it had four gold teeth. I covered my ears when two more blasts sounded In the small room. The fleshy figure lay motionless."

The man stood there revolver aimed at the fleshy mass on the ground. Blood stated to pool around the body.
