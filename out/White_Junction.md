# An account of an ongoing possession...

When I was an Altar Boy, I served with an odd kid that became known as the *Priest Confessor*. Believe it or not, somehow it happened that priests started coming to HIM to confess their sins.

But the last priest he’d ever see gave him much, much more than a confession.

I was only like 10 at the time. I was there for Kenny’s first priest confession. And I was there for the last one. To this day, though I grew up to have a career in medicine, I still sometimes wake up screaming in the night, remembering that day.

Kenny had always been a sweet and gentle kid. He tried to play sports with us, the kid had guts, but he was the slowest, the weakest, the least coordinated.

He wasn’t religious, and his parents weren’t at all either, but they had him become an Altar Boy to appease the grandfather. The story was that when Kenny’s grandmother first saw him as a newborn, minutes after coming into the world, she turned white, made the sign of the cross and dropped dead. So Kenny’s grandfather believed a terrible evil would happen to Kenny…or perhaps be done by him.

But as he grew up, it was clear the kid could never do anything bad. This was the kind of boy who carried spiders out of the house to free them. And even though he was a mostly quiet child, he was surprisingly popular at school. He had a great sense of humor, so that helped, but mostly there was just a warm feeling that made us all protective of him.

So one day we were working the mass with Father Ron when we noticed the priest was really upset. His eyes were bloodshot, like he’d been crying, he kept forgetting the words, and his hands were shaking so bad he could barely break the bread.

When mass was over, the distraught priest couldn’t hold it together any longer. As me and Kenny were cleaning up behind the altar, Ron suddenly fell to his knees before a dumbfounded Kenny. And started confessing.

I can’t recall everything the priest said, and he used language that was very vague, but the gist of it was he’d done something that hurt someone else, something that involved desires that he’d long held in check. I had no idea what he was talking about then and could tell Kenny didn’t either, but Kenny stood right there before the kneeling priest as though it was his duty.
