I finally moved out a few weeks ago, after living with my parents. I will be studying in a different city, so naturally I want to be closer to university.

It's a small town. Very rural, quiet and beautiful. Absolutely perfect for a new chapter in my life.

There are a few flats on the floors above me. I think it's 4 floors in total, not including me at the very bottom. We share the same main entrance that is always open, so literally anyone can open the door and walk into the place whenever they feel like it. Not really a fan of that, but eh. It's only till I finish and pass every semester.
Once inside, you can see the letterboxes for each person that is living in this complex on the left, with their last names attached to them. Then there are stairs in the middle that lead up to the floors above. Also an old elevator which hasn't been used in years, because it is broken. At least I think it is, because there is red tape in the shape of the letter X spread across the metal doors. Whoever did that is certainly not a specialist, because it looks like a first grader put it there. I am not sure whether it'll ever get fixed, but I don't need to use it anyways, since the door to my flat is in front of the letterboxes on the bottom floor. So to the right when you enter the building.
Under the stairs seems to be another door. Maybe to the basement, but I don't really care, because I am only at home to sleep. A green bicycle is standing in front of that specific door. It looks like it hasn't been used in decades.

I spend my days studying at university with my new friends or go out with the same people for some coffee or tea. I usually only stay home on Sundays to watch movies or to play videogames. But every night I hear this weird noise. It sounds like someone is moving furniture around to redecorate their place.
I usually go to bed at 8 pm and just scroll on my phone for one or two hours before putting it down on my nightstand to sleep.
When you enter the room I sleep in, the bed is in the far left corner, my feet facing the door. My head and right side are hugged by the walls. The bathroom is to my right, a wall between the two rooms.

It is 9:00 pm right now, I am doomscrolling through different social media sites when I hear this noise again. Just like every night. It is subtle, but makes the walls vibrate, so it is really irritating. The past nights I tried to cover my ears with wax meant for blocking noise, tried sleeping earlier and even put on headphones to listen to music, but nothing works. The vibrating is causing such a deep tone that manages to go through absolutely everything. No matter what I do, I can hear it. Every. Single. Night. I stay up all night, rolling from side to side, staring at the walls and ceiling. Each time I close my eyes, the noise seems to get louder. I am sick of this, angry and about to cry, because I am feeling helpless. Just when I am about to doze off, my 6:00 am alarm goes off.

I let out a loud sigh, followed by a whiney groan. I cannot believe I spent my entire night not resting at all.
I am exhausted, tired and snap at everything and everyone at this point. I want to make coffee, but the bag with the coffee beans falls over, spreading them across the entire kitchen floor. I bend down to pick them up, but end up hitting my head against one of the kitchen drawers when I try to go back up. Another sigh followed by a whispered "ouch..." Okay, surely it cannot get any worse, I think. I'll just make some instant coffee instead. It just needs boiling water and the coffee powder. So I fill the kettle with water, put it on the stove and fill my mug with the instant coffee which was in these tiny, long bags that you just rip open at the top.
I just stand there. Staring at the kettle that was slowly heating up. Eyes unfocused and the vision blurry as it was extremely tiring to focus my eyes after no sleep at all.
Suddenly, a loud whistle throws me back into reality, making me scream from the unexpected high pitched noise. "Right, the coffee..." I shake my head, being disappointed at myself, while pouring the hot water into my prepared mug. The powder and spoon are already in there, ready to stir.

With my finished coffee in hand, I drop down on the couch to watch a movie. There is no chance I will go to university today. I haven't slept. How would I be able to pay attention..? As expected, a few minutes after I turned on a random movie, I fall asleep only to be awakened by a horrible quaking and shaking. I sit up immediately, breathing heavily. I can feel my heart pump out of my chest as I grab my phone to use its flashlight. When I try to unlock it, I see the time and freeze. 9:30 pm. Not again. Who the FUCK redecorates their room? Every. Single. Damn. Night?! At the same time too?! Also: Did I really sleep that long..?

With a sigh I get up to pour my cold coffee into the kitchen sink and notice that some stuff had fallen over. With a raised eyebrow, I put everything back into place and walk into the bedroom.
When I enter, a sudden sharp pain fills me and I drop to the floor, grabbing my foot. "God fucking damnit..." I say through my clenched teeth. I must have hit my foot against a table that is near the entrance of the room. But how?... It doesn't make any sense to me. I just shake my head violently, wanting to forget about it. It's probably nothing. My brain and body must be fucked up from the restless nights and ruined sleep schedule.

I go to bed. Pull the covers up to my chin and lay on my back, staring at the ceiling. The longer I look at it, the weirder it feels. Something is not right, because usually when I look up, I only see the ceiling. Nothing else. But now I see the ceiling and the corner of my wooden wardrobe. As if someone had pushed it closer to my bed, causing it to be in my line of sight. Now that I think about it, the sounds have stopped.
Quickly, I check my phone that I had placed on the nightstand. 10:15 pm. Strange. This is the first night it stopped sooner. But why..?

Again, I shake my head. I must be seeing things. Even though I had just slept for many hours in one go, I fall asleep quickly once more. All these lost hours from the nights before caught up to me, it seems.

The next morning, my alarm rings at 6:00 am, so I get up, rub my eyes, slowly walk into the bathroom and get ready for uni.
I take my bag, put on my shoes and jacket, grab my keys and leave the apartment. But before I actually take the bus, I check my mail. You never know.
As I stood in front of the letterboxes, I couldn't help but notice that the old, green and rusty bike had fallen over. Odd.
After staring at it for a while, I shrug and leave.

Typical university day. Get up. Leave. Go to uni. Study. Leave. Go home. And go home I did.
When I get into the complex, I realise that someone put the bike back into place, but something about it looks different. I don't know what it is. I mean, it's still green, rusty and ugly.

Whatever. With my keys in hand, I enter my apartment and lock the door behind me. A quick glance at my phone. "8:00 pm". Sigh. Another exhausting day done. After a short bathroom visit to change and brush my teeth, I hop to bed and try to relax on my phone, till I eventually pass out.

This night, the moving noises were not as loud which is why I was able to sleep through the night. But when my alarm rings and I wake up, it's... dark.
The air feels thin and heavy. I have trouble breathing. Quickly, I use my phone as a flashlight and get up to hit the lightswitch of my bedroom as fast as I can. I didn't even have to run far. It was only one step to take  which didn't make sense...

Now I stand here frozen in my bedroom. Hand on the lightswitch. Tears in my eyes. My bed only one single step away from me. My wardrobe pressed against the side of the bed. The table touching the end of the bed and brushing my side. The window gone.

I had not been wrong the past few days. Something had indeed been weird. The bike falling over and looking like it is out of position. Me hitting my foot, even though I should be able to walk around my flat blindfolded. The stuff in my kitchen falling. Everything seeming out of place.
No one has been moving stuff around next door all these nights. I knew that. I absolutely knew. Because behind that wall where it has been coming from, is... nothing.
I don't have a neighbour next door, because there is no flat. No room. No furniture. Only the neatly cut grass that surrounds the complex.
The walls had been moving every single night. And tonight, they locked me in. The room is so small and tiny now. This could be a toddler's or baby's room. There is no door I could go through. No window. No toilet. No water or food. And eventually, I will either die from no oxygen or get crushed by these walls.
