I was on the verge of a panic attack.﻿

Sweat poured down my face as I clenched the steering wheel. Streetlamps rhythmically illuminated the car as I drove. My mind was everywhere at once. The closer I got to my house, the more I felt the anxiety build and beg for release. As I decided what to do from here, I recanted the night’s previous events.

I work at a bar and got off at 10pm. It was just late enough to be on edge as I took the back exit through an alleyway. My fear was heightened when I noticed an unknown car waiting at the other end of the alley, blocking my passage to the street. Memories of my past flooded my mind...

Five years ago, I worked for some very bad people. In exchange for jail time, I gave information to the police and was relocated. Since then, I kept my act clean but always kept a watchful eye in case my past decided to catch up to me.

With the ominous car blocking me from the alley, it seemed my reckoning was finally coming.

My hand was ready on my gun as I casually walked towards the exit. Two masked figures stepped out from the shadows and grabbed me. I fired off my gun in pure reflex and felt the weight of one person slump against me.

The second assailant had their hands up and shouted “Wait!” but I didn’t give them a chance. No way I was gonna fall for that. After firing another round, the second person fell silently to the ground.

I had survived...but what next? Knowing the people I’d worked for, they’d have someone looking for me at home.

*Oh God, they could have Julie! I had to make sure she was okay...*

I almost ran to my car, but quickly decided against it. Taking *their* car was probably best. They wouldn’t see me coming.

It all happened in a blur as my panicked mind went into overdrive. I couldn’t call the police. I’m not supposed to have a gun and having two bodies in my trunk wouldn’t help my case. They would never believe an ex-con, anyway.

I hopped into the car and made my way home, trying to stay at the speed limit as best as possible. Getting pulled over would only delay my efforts more.

I called Julie’s phone.

*It went straight to voicemail.*

“Nonononono,” I said under my breath.

I kept trying the number over and over, but it went to voicemail every time. I finally made it to my block within ten minutes. It felt like an eternity.

I parked two houses over and walked to my home.

Unsettling was the most fitting to describe my house. There were multiple cars nearby that I didn’t recognize and none of the lights were on. This was highly unusual, as we kept as many lights on as possible. Even when we’re asleep, we keep at least two lights on inside so it appears someone’s awake.

To try and stir up any movement, I knocked on the door and quickly crouched down in the nearby bushes. There was no answer, so I crept back to the door and put my ear against it.

Maybe it was my imagination, but I swore I heard faint murmurs and whispering. Going around back was the best entrance at this point so I silently made my way through the yard’s side fence.

I heard the faint sound of my front door creak open, forcing me to double-time it to the back door. My adrenaline was pumping wildly and I had to make a conscious effort to breathe slow and deep. I could practically hear my pulse hammering in my ears. Finally, I was able to get my faculties under control.

My quivering hands barely managed to unlock the back door and I crept in while trying my best to breathe shallow.

In the darkness of my home I heard muffled shuffling from the den. I waited for a moment to let my eyes adjust and almost jumped out of my skin when I beheld a figure right in front of me with their back turned.

Holding my breath, I crept up and grabbed the figure around the neck and put the muzzle of my gun to their head.

“Where are you keeping her, you son of a....”

*The lights flipped on.*

“SURPRI—“

The words cut off as I witnessed all my friends together in the den whip around in confusion to greet me. They gasped at the sight of me holding a gun to my friend’s head.

“Holy shit! What are you doing, Cameron?!” My friend yelled.

I immediately let go and my poor friend crawled away on the floor and sat there in shock. As someone tended to them I just stood there, completely taken aback by everything.

“Oh, I’m uh...so-s-sorry...”

I holstered my gun as I caught my breath.

“Cam, are you okay? What’s going on?” My next door neighbor asked.

“Y-yeah. I-uh, hah....I’ve just had a-uh really jumpy night.”

“Damn, man. You look like you’ve seen a ghost. Relax man, it’s just a surprise birthday party.”

I took another breath and laughed hysterically for a moment. Here I was, thinking I was going to get assassinated in my own home and it was a surprise party! The fact that it was my birthday never even occurred to me.

“Oh my God...you guys scared the bejeezus out of me!” I said. “You wouldn’t believe the night I’ve had!”

I felt giddy with relief. Bringing up the masked goons in the alley seemed distant because I was so elated that my home wasn’t infiltrated. We chatted for a couple of minutes and I apologized profusely for being so paranoid.

“Yeah, you scared us pretty good there, buddy,” said Anne, my wife’s best friend. “Especially since we didn’t see Ryan’s car.”

“Ryan’s car? Wouldn’t you be watching out for *my* car?”

“No. I guess they changed their minds last minute. Ryan and Julie were supposed to surprise you when you got out of work. They even had a cake. Haven’t you seen them?”

I looked down to see a splatter of birthday cake on my jeans.

The unholy epiphany wrenched at my gut and my world began spinning as I fell to the floor.

“Hey, Cameron!? Are you okay?”

*No. I was not okay…*
