In your regular, everyday kind of scenario, a suburban swimming pool sitting next to an abandoned factory shouldn't have been all that mind-blowing. I mean, there were so, so many reasons as to why it could've been sitting there. Like, there could've been a home there once, yanno? 

Well, ya see, here's the thing. The pool didn't look like it belonged next to an old abandoned factory. I mean, to be fair, it's not like I've seen a lot of pools next to abandoned factories, but you'd think that the pool and the factory should have the same degree of rust, decay, growth, etc. The pool should've been mostly dried up with algae sitting on top of the remaining water, the stair bars should've been covered in rust, some of the tiles should've been missing, etc. 

But this pool, man, this pool looked like Superman or someone had lifted it out of some rich guy's backyard and plunked it down into the concrete that very day. Everything was just so freaking pristine. The tiles looked as blue as the water you'd see in some travel photos and videos of, like, the Bahamas, the Caribbean, Hawaii, or whatever. And the crystal-clearness of this glass, man, looking through it was like looking through a brand new window. 

Looking at that, then looking up, and seeing those boarded-up windows and rusted walls in the same eye space was just soâ€¦so wild, it made me feel all dizzy. Then, to make things even weirder, the freaking pool just blinked out of existence while I was standing there in awe looking at the pool and factory together. At that point, my mind just peaced out to Oz or wherever for a few minutes. 

When my mind came back, I tried getting all the pieces of this wigged-out jigsaw puzzle together. I guess I could've just been crazy. Perhaps there were these toxic fumes or whatever that could've been leftover from when they were manufacturing asbestos or whatever dangerous stuff in that factory.

But as somebody who's all into ghosts, aliens, and all that (as well as someone who just got mind freaked by a pool) that wasn't the first thing that crossed my headspace. What my back-from-Oz mind settled on was that this lucky bastard (the lucky bastard being me) had stumbled across some actual possible supernatural phenomena. If that was true, there was the possibility that I could make, just, mountains of moolah if I filmed it and talked all about it on those interview shows and maybe wrote a book about it.  

So I got back home and asked my old man if I could borrow one of his less-than-spectacular cameras. My dad was one of the best professional photographers in the world so he had, like, the most high-end type of stuff. He would never let me borrow that kinda stuff, though. He'd just let me get the older stuff, but, yanno, it was a "ya get what ya get" sorta situation. Also, the older stuff was still pretty dang nice, so it would get the job done and all that. 

So I got this old tripod and camera from him and I just hauled it over to the factory on foot. This wasn't that hard to do as the tripod was, like 10 pounds, the camera was five pounds and I did weightlifting on the weekends. Also, I only had to walk around ten minutes to get there. So it was all no sweat. 

I probably should've taken my car, though. 'Cause, ya see, me hauling all this junk attracted the attention of this little girl in my neighborhood. Sad to say, I don't remember her name or anything. Anyways, her parents were the type to go all hands off so they let her go wherever the hell she wanted. Today, she decided she wanted to go see what kinda stuff I was getting into. For some dang reason, she decided to be all sneaky about it, like I would've yelled at her had she told me she was following me. I totally wouldn't have. 
 
Anyways, I made it back to the factory and felt siked to see the pool sitting there again in all its sparkly glory. However, as I started getting the tripod all vertical as my old man had shown me, I heard the sound of tiny flip-flops pattering across the concrete. Then this tiny voice screamed out.  

"POOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!!!!!" 

I looked up. Before the thought of "maybe I should stop her" even crossed my headspace, the little giggler was already a few leg lengths away from that supernatural pool. And then, and then this little dummy decided to just yeet herself into this pool even though she was fully clothed and she had no idea what the hell was even in that pool. 

"Wait, get out of there," I said, but she was already deep down in that blue. 

My body then froze like a snowman in a snowstorm. The little girl came up out of the water after a few seconds and just started floating there. She spotted me and opened her mouth to speak.  

The pool poofed away again. It didn't take all of that little girl [with it](https://www.reddit.com/r/frerkinghorrorstories/).
