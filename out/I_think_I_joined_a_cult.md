What the fuck.



My name is Michael, and I just drove home from a long road trip.



I was telling my sisters about the board game convention I attended while gone the day before. We would set up times to play games almost every weekend. We all loved it, and I had a pretty sizable board game collection. We were all equally competitive with each other, making one another laugh if we pulled off some clever way to win. Our last game was about some space crew that needed you to negotiate with your competitors to work together but ultimately for your own needs to win. My younger sister Kelly had a slight mean streak in her debate but would often end on a fair note. My older sister Margaret would have to mediate between our squabbling. Our mom, Janet, would happily cook fancy dinners to pair with the games. She loved how close we were. Our dad, Mark, would take their kids to the movies or the park to give us a break and play video games if we weren't finished by the time they returned.



We live in a hot, humid city, and I was sweating when I got home. I felt hesitant to go inside. Their cars were there, but the house was dead silent, with a putrid, meaty smell emanating from the door.



I found them around the house, lying in strange positions with odd protrusions all over their bodies. Their mouths were hanging open, and their eyes wide.



I tried calling the police, but there was no answer. Even the direct line didn't work for the cops or the hospital. I floundered around the house, not knowing what to do. I left the house and banged on my neighbor's home as well. Ultimately, I sat, defeated, on my living room couch. I looked over to our family computer and remembered the security cameras. Don't ask. I thought they were invasive, but my dad wanted them throughout the house.



I pulled up the logs and scrolled through the footage. I saw a twisted, bulging creature with long, pulsing, spindly appendages moving slowly through our home.



My family didn't notice as it crept through the house, slithering through each room. They had just been talking to each other or sitting at their desks, doing whatever they were doing. My eyes widened as I watched it envelop everyone it passed and leave without them knowing. Everyone, including the kids, continued like nothing had happened, and about ten minutes later, they doubled over and, with silent screams, writhed on the floor. My mouth hung open as I sat there, staring at the camera. The creature looked more visible than it had before, despite the crappy quality.



Looking at it gave me a headache, and I felt a wave of nausea bubble up in my gut. I was hyperventilating and stumbling around my home. There were strange markings around their bodies that seemed unfocused and blurry. I cried, wrapped my arms around our dead dog, Layla, on the couch, and fell asleep. I awoke with a start and darted out the door, remembering the carnage around me.



I frantically drove to the Police Station, my gut-wrenching as I desperately drove. As I slowly walked to the doors, the same decaying smell wafted through them. I didn't want to open them, knowing what was coming. The cultists intentionally left a letter in the receptionist's hand on the desk. A large cut surrounded her severed hand, carved into the desk, screaming, "Read this!" without any words. I gingerly grabbed the note out of the girl's grasp.



It read:

We have watched you grieve for those who were taken. We see your pain, but do you understand the balance that has been restored? The world was corrupt, dying, and damaged.

The innocent slaughter has brought unwavering equilibrium to his universe. The scales have leveled out.

You may think us monstrous, but our lives are instrumental to harmony. Yours is one of them, as proven by surviving. In repentance and remembrance, we understand that even in death, there is life.

Please witness the beautiful brilliance of balance in being born again at midnight tonight at the new building. Bring any person you encounter; they are as important as you are. Open your heart to The Quiet One to recognize his greatness and brevity.

With kind regards,

The Order of the Silent Vigil



I wanted to know what the hell was going on, so I found the new building. It was a giant biological structure at the end of town. It was made of bone held by muscle and sinew. It pulsated like a beating heart in rhythmic measure, with a quiet thumping resonating throughout the grounds. The large door at the front had skin covering the frame and handles to accommodate movement.



The pulpit was full of ordinary people in regular garb, led by a woman in a yellow cloak holding a branch. Her golden hair flowed down, and her soothing musical voice carried through the church. The stench of raw meat encompassed the entire premises.



She said, "Welcome, quiet brethren. I am delighted to share our illuminated perspectives with you. Your curiosity is... refreshing, considering the limited understanding you have had access to thus far. Allow me to guide you through the complexities, and I am sure you will find our wisdom... enlightening. We summoned The Silent One in reverence for our misdeeds. We hold his punishment as a testament to living better lives in perpetuity and strength."



She procured a dagger.



"Please come forth and accept the symbols of our faith and everlasting love he has created. We grow together as one for his grateful presence and understanding. May the markings run pure and cut deep into your souls."



Her arms had scars in beautiful patterns, shown as she withdrew her sleeves. I didn't want them, but everyone else seemed to be in a trance except me, so I went along with it, not wanting to stand out. No one made a sound as they received their embellishments, so I started worrying about crying out as she made them. My heartbeat quickened, and I had a nervous twitch in my leg. My breathing was labored, and I couldn't see straight. As I got closer, I could see the scars more clearly, and they seemed to shine.



My phone's battery is dying. I've been hiding it from them in the shadows and typing when I could. I am getting closer to my turn. I can feel the weight of their gaze upon me. The brightness of her scars is making it difficult to think. I don't know if I can resist any longer. The place gets longer as we shuffle forward. My phone got darker, so I'll send this before it dies. I can't get out. Her voice is lulling me into compliance, and it's hard to concentrate. Goodbye, whoever is going to read this. I hope they don't find your town.
