My grandmother used to live with us, in the house. I used to help her to the bathroom, change her clothes and feed her breakfast, a snack and lunch, before my mother came home and took over. I'm a student at the community college a few towns over so I take my mother's car to class. In exchange, I would take care of my grandmother in the morning and run whatever errands my mother couldn't get to that day.

On September 27th, two weeks after class started, I came home to find my grandmother's bedroom empty. I found my mother on the back deck, smoking. She only smoked when she was stressed which seemed to be all the time now.

"Where's Vuvu," I asked. 

My mother took a long drag, killed the cigarette on the railing and threw the cigarette across the driveway. She seemed like she was taking her time on purpose.

I was going to ask her again before she said, "In the basement."

That's where my grandfather went when it was his turn. I didn't think my grandmother was ready so soon, so I went to talk with her. The basement smells like mildew and stone. I don't know how else to explain the smell of stone to you, but when you're standing in front of a few megaliths, you'll know.

The basement floor is paved stone, except for a small 5x5 patch of dirt behind the washer and dryer. I opened the dryer to see if my clothes from the night before were dry. They were damp, so I put the dryer on again. I squeezed between the two machines and bent over the freshly turned dirt. 

"Vuvu?"

Nothing.

"Vuvu?"

A mound appeared. Her hand broke through the mound. I knelt and grabbed her hand. She squeezed it. "You should have told me you was ready. I could have gone to the hardware store and got some fresh dirt."

She let go and shooed me away.

I had some homework to do that night so I left her alone. 

I heard creaking in the corner, so I went to check on my grandfather. He's been down there for month's, in that chair. Not talking.  Just rocking back and forth. Every time you go down the basement stairs, all you see is the glow of his red eyes, looking right at you.

My mother claims he doesn't eat but the Murray boy went missing a few days ago, so I know that's a lie. I don't really talk about my family much because people will not understand and that's okay. We all have cultural differences. The only reason I am sharing this here is because of what happened when I checked on my grandfather for the final time.

  
I asked him the usual questions: Did you eat? Did mom come to see you? 

He's still staring. So I check his neck to see if he's healing. It's taking him longer than usual. I've never dealt with the Elder's before so I am only going by what I was told. The neck wounds should be the first to heal, but my grandfather is showing signs that don't match with what I know. What do I know?

  
I'm leaning over him, checking the other side of his neck. It's the same. Still open, still oozing pus. I go to fix his collar when he turns his head for the first time since before he came back and he opens his mouth to say something but I can't hear him.

He's gargling and trying to get the words out. I want to call my mother down but I know she'll show up and he'll be mute again and I'll look foolish. So I say, "What is wrong, Papa?"

He's still trying to talk. 

He's not supposed to talk. That's what my great, great Uncle Salvadore wrote in the margins of the notes. "They never talk which is a good sign. If they try, it is because the Elder elder's have stirred. Should you ever come across such a situation, back away quickly and inform the Clergy." 

But this is my grandfather. Always the talker. Always the storyteller, so I wait for him to say something. But he gives up.

I haven't told my mother but weird things have started happening and I think I should have told her when it first started. My grandmother hasn't surfaced in days. My grandfather's eyes aren't shining anymore but I can't tell if he's good or not, because it's all the same. And, for some reason, the Murray boy keeps coming into my room at night and pointing at me. 

I want to tell my mother. I need to.  I just know that if I do, she'll never trust me again and I need the car. I need to get to class. Am I the asshole?
