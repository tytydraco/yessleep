When I was younger, I was told by my grandmother that making a wish on shooting star would guarantee a wish as long as I didn't tell anyone my wish until I received it. It has been a long time almost 20 years since the last time I saw a shooting star, with me now being 28 years old. 

 I had moved from a city to be with my current fiancé after my first marriage fell threw a lot  of problems.  Mostly based on infidelity and more than one accusation of drunk enabled situations. Living in a small town here in Texas wasn't really something I even now have gotten used too. My job is miles away (45-50 minute drive to be exact), but pays a decent amount. And my new fiancé Kyle had moved from California just to be with me but gladly never lost control while drinking or laid a hand on me was a very great asset to starting over a new beginning after 10 years. 

What made me happy to be here regardless of everything being miles out of reach. Was how quiet it was , the sky thought was the best part. Houses here were a few blocks apart covered in cactus and pine tress. The night sky was almost as clear as the morning clouds. However I worked graveyard shift at my job which is a night stocking position. So most of the time I was listening to some tunes while spacing out and looking at the stars and watching out for no deer that might appear in front of my car during the long drive.

Things have been for the most part great here. However, even though I find myself talking about the good things currently going in my life there is something I find myself finding more than a coincidence. It happened about the start of December 22' when I saw it , a shooting star. I was surprised since it had been a long time since I seen one. I slowly thought to myself what do I wish for. Peace on humanity? A raise at my current job? Maybe even to somehow teleport my job close to me so I wouldn't have to drive today. 

Instead I ended up wishing that the truck from my work wouldn't show so I wouldn't have to go to work, in my job a truck shows up with our merchandise so we could get it with pallet jacks and bring it to the floor to stock . I was about half my drive when I received a group message on my phone from my boss saying the truck had been cancelled. I know I just made a wish and behold it happened, I almost huffed to myself thinking it was some magical being granting my dream to now to go into work. But no it wasn't surprising it was raining roughly throughout the day and a cold front had just hit. This is Texas most of the time we weren't prepared of the cold. But if your a Texan you know what I am referring too.  

I couldn't tell if I was happy about the truck being cancelled or upset I would lose out on some money from my check. I turned back and went home, by the time I got home it was already basically storming and almost hitting the 30s in temp. 

I went inside and greeted Kyle explaining to him my truck had been cancelled and went into my room. When I took off my uniform and watched Kyle play the new High on Life game. I received a phone call from my grandfather that my grandmother had fallen ill. To the point where she was in the ICU, and was receiving severe medical attention.  I couldn't find the words, but I told my grandfather I would be there the next day to visit them in the hospital which was about 4 hours away from my current location. 

I will be posting another update soon as my current connection is going off and on. Small towns am i right?
