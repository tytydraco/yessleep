The car in front of me screeched to a halt, the screaming whine of rubber against concrete was enough to grab my attention: but it wasn’t quick enough.

I slammed into the slick, silver four-door in front of me, the deceleration force of the airbag smacking me firmly in the face. I felt my head spin as the airbag began to deflate. The ringing in my ears was viciously sharp, like a telephone laid off the hook, but directly in your ear.

The drunken, vasovagal syncope of a panicked heart and brain slurred the world into a place I didn’t recognize. I had experienced this before, I tried to focus on breathing as I squinted to focus, the bag deflating and giving view to the street and smoking accident that I had inadvertently caused.

The words found me, as if a jolt of disbelief moved like lightning down my spine, 

Wait.

Breaking into a cold sweat, I realized that I didn’t know where I was.

Panic surged over me; quickly receiving a sobering dose of adrenaline from my poor, possibly rattled up, injured brain.

I didn’t feel injured? I thought, gingerly running a hand over the back of my head to feel for anything.. Obvious, I guess?

Aside from the tenderness caused by a quick hello to Newton's Law of Motion, I hadn’t felt like I had experienced anything that could even cause a headache. So much was happening at once, I must have been sitting there for 20 minutes immersed in a dissociative state before I realized that I had been sitting unbothered in my all consuming anxiety.

Why hadn’t the guy knocked on the door? 

My folks always told me to stay in the car when it came to things like this. I looked around again and saw people walking.

I didn’t pay it much mind as I looked back down at my phone to call 911, wiping off tears and snot off of my face in a manner most pitiful to an adult.

“Hello, 911, what’s your emergency?”

“Hi-” I started, I’ve made 911 calls before. Name, location, what’s going on/danger, details. 

This sends another crashing wave of panic.

“Hello?” The responder calls out again. 

“Y-yes, sorry,” I managed to stammer out, feeling my chest muscles clench in terror. I didn’t know where I was. 

“What’s your emergency, ma’am?” The patient, yet wearied response came. “I am reporting a car accident.” Comes spilling out of my mouth, “I don’t know where I am. I-” “Ma’am, are you hurt?” 

I take a breath, and give myself a cursory lookover. As my gaze swung upward, I noticed the people on the sidewalk all walking one direction. 


“Ma’am? Do I need to send an ambulance?” Surprised me, their tone holding that matter-of-fact professionalism that I wish I could return. 

“No, no. Uh– Well, actually, I.. I don’t know where I am.” My voice cracking and crumbling on the tail end of my word. “I rear-ended the guy in front of me.” I sat up straighter to see over the crumpled front of my car.

I paused, again to the frustration of the dutiful first responder:

I didn’t see the driver of the other car.

“Is anyone else injured? Have you got out of your car?”

“No, no I don’t think so.” I gulped. “I may have really hurt my head.. Don’t even remember how I got here.” 

Choking back a sob I had a brief conversation about my personal details, which even then were uncomfortably fuzzy. I fished around for the papers that I needed to prepare for the accident while I regained some composure.

“Okay. Can you see any road signs around you? Any identifying buildings?” The responder then pauses, their tone dropping to whisper. I’ll never forget the way they hummed against the phone. 

“What are the people around you doing?”

I stopped in my tracks as I went to reach for the glove box.

“I’m.. I’m sorry?”

“Road signs, ma’am. Is there a traffic light or a road to identify your location?” They continued, almost as if the previously cryptic statement was just some kind of slip of the tongue, or a hiccup. “We are able to access your location through your phone but it does help with accuracy and the report that will need to be written.” 

I rolled down my window and poked my head out to see a stop light about, 500 feet away. I squinted to read.

“Right before the section of..” As I was reading the signs, my eyes were inexplicably drawn to the amassing march of people.

“Alright, please remain in your vehicle. An officer is enroute. Please do not leave the area until the officer has arrived.”

“Wait–” I interrupted. “I didn’t finish-”

“Ma’am, you specified the intersection of-”

A shooting headache pulses in my head, I hear the words but they sound like someone talking much too close to a microphone. 

The headache left as fast as it came on, but not before I could determine that I was hearing the responder begin to hang up on me.. But not before a discernible pause.

I swear I heard them whisper to me; like a hushed warning you’d give to someone under a desk playing hide and seek,

“--have mercy.”

Click, and the call had ended.

Disoriented, I opened the door to my car. My bones felt heavy, as if all they sought was to sink back into the earth. This was the first time I had ever been in a car accident; I was normally a good driver. I sheepishly took a wide, swinging path to look at the car in front of me, crossing the road to sit on a bench on the sidewalk. There was no traffic, which was fortunately odd. I removed myself from the road, eyes trained on the car in front of me. 

I looked at the back bumper and groaned, My insurance rates are definitely going up now. 

Continuing to assess the damage, I remember that the driver is not visible. Squinting to see if I could see any human-shape in the window, I determined that I couldn’t see a darn thing.

I waited 15 minutes. A few other people walk by, in the same direction as the others. I try not to be rude as I glance at passersby.

They’d all be pretty unremarkably if it hadn’t been for the two most arguably disturbing feature:
Aside from the obvious one-way march of foot traffic, their eyes are seemingly trained on the route in front of them.

I open my mouth to address one of the passersby when the metallic crunch of a vehicle slamming into my car commands my attention. Practically levitating, I sprung up from my place on the bench to witness a man crunching into the rear end of my car. 

Placing my hands on my head, I let out a shocked scream, bumping into a man who happened to be marching on by with that same sense of purpose. He threw me off of him without a word, and kept walking.

Without a beat, the perpetrator's car door swung open. He got out very calmly.

He was probably in his 40s, if I had to guess. Clean shaven, business casual, a combover. Normal kinda office guy. Aside from the glazed look of his eyes, he’d be as nondescript as any other bureaucrat.

“What the hell?!” I can’t help but shriek. A pulsing, helpful throb of pain to remind me that I’m in no position to be starting fights.

The man calmly closes the door to his car, turns, and starts walking.

I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.

A realization froze the blood in my veins as I turned to look at the mangled car in front of me.

I couldn’t see the driver because he wasn’t there.

My eyes immediately began searching for something that I could throw, maybe just for the confirmation. Even though I was confident that the driver was gone, I just couldn’t risk it.

I settled on a pretty hefty glass bottle with questionable liquid inside of it and heaved it at the car. It smashed against the window and shattered it.

It garnered no attention, a few people walked by without a glance. An impregnable silence assured me that the driver was either gone, or dead.

Thank God that it was the former, as I found after gingerly tip-toeing to see an empty car. The radio was still playing; it was a fuzzy gospel tune.

Finally remembering to check my phone, a red blinking “20% battery” warning reminded me that I’m an idiot for never charging the stupid thing. I crafted a message to multiple people along with some photos of the accident, assuring them that I was awaiting an officer, and sent it off.

I waited a couple of minutes, and with no response, decided to shut off my phone to conserve battery.

“Fuck.”

Was all I could say as I made my way back to my bench on the sidewalk. Resting my head firmly in my hands, I strained to remember what I was DOING here in the first place. The memories felt like they were.. static, in nature. Like the way a VHS used to hiss and crackle, and how when you brushed up against the TV, it would make your hair stand on end. So close, enough to feel it, but not to know it any better. The distortion felt almost nauseating.

I was made aware quite suddenly of a presence at that moment as they bumped into the bench, quickly course correcting and continuing on without a word.

Maybe it was the head trauma talking, but something certainly wasn’t right here. I needed to know why everyone was walking in one direction. Like a flock of birds, all in a motion, towards an unspoken destination.

So, for some reason, I followed this person.

I don’t know what compelled me to follow. Maybe it was the way their body ragdolled their leg against the metal bench, maybe it was the way they now dragged their ankle that now sat at an unnatural angle. This was a younger man, possibly a teenager? His pants sat loosely on his legs, but his pace told you his injury should have impeded this march; and yet.. On he went.

An overwhelming urge to continue onward bathed me in a sense of purpose; as if the path ahead beckoned forward. I looked around again, seeing more people now. All ages and walks of life present, it was as if the whole town marched with the precision of an arrow.

For what felt like miles, I followed this band of walkers, making failed attempt after failed attempt to talk to anyone around me.

They all maintained their solemn expression and didn’t spare me a glance. Even as I tried politely engaging them, waving my hand, nothing. Should I step in front of them? I thought, calculating the space between two walkers and something in my head reached down to grab my stomach in a vicious, twisting grip.

It felt wrong- No, dangerous, to try to dissuade them from their path. 

The lump in my throat threatened to tie itself into a knot as I stood aside and watched, before deciding to join the crowd at an infuriatingly slow pace. One foot after the other, as if time nor urgency had any factor in their effort to go…somewhere. It was a lazy stroll, one that would probably infuriate me in a regular crowd. I joked to myself that I normally hate slow walkers before I felt this warm sense of belonging encompass me. It started like a tingle, like numbness pricking my finger tips and toes and spreading through my body. As if I had submerged myself into a warm bath, goosebumps rising to respond.

It felt as natural as a bird joining a migrating flock, moving as a unit now. There was no more bumping or collisions, only a droning march of non-verbal humans moving together as one.
It was then that my body had begun to feel heavy again. My shoes scraping against the concrete of the sidewalk, warmth creeping up from my extremities. 

As I felt the weight of my eyelids growing heavier, a strange calm began to wash over me. The sounds around me fade into a distant hum, like static on a radio. My thoughts started to blur, losing their sharpness as if dissolving into fog. The world feels less vivid, as though I’m stepping back from it, becoming a spectator rather than a participant.
The rhythm of my breathing became steady and mechanical, each breath pulling me deeper into this altered state. My body moved in sync with the others, each footstep echoing the one before. Simple, repetitive motion that felt oddly comforting. There was a strange liberation in this loss of individuality; my thoughts slip away, and I feel a sense of purpose in the uniformity around me.

Emotional turmoil faded into the background, replaced by the collective feeling of calmness. It was like being part of a larger mechanism, where my will becomes secondary to the rhythm and order of the march. I no longer felt the weight of decisions or the complexity of my situation. Instead, I was just part of a line, moving forward with an unwavering resolve, my mind drifting further into the haze of the drone-like existence.
