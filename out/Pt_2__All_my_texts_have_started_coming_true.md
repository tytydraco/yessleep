Pt 2 — All my texts have started coming true. 
  
I needn't have worried getting time off work to begin the search for my phone and whoever had it.  
The bosses death had stunned the whole office, and we were closing up shop for the day to try and wrap our heads around it all.  

Some went home, wanting to be with their families after such a horrible event. Others went to the bar, drinking away their shock.  

I opted out of both, and instead sent a text that could,.and would, forever change my life.  
“Please. Can I just have my phone back? I'm willing to do anything."  
And I was.  

If I was asked to sacrifice myself, I would do it. I had lived a pretty vain life, had never settled down, never had kids. If it took me dying to end this whole thing.. Well I was willing to accept my fate, whatever the outcome.  
I waited in anticipation for the reply.   

Would they curse me out, send me on way to a certain death?  
I had messaged most of the people whose numbers my phone held, on Facebook, telling them that my phone had been hacked and to not open any text messages as they could have scaming viruses.   

I hoped that would help, maybe if people didn't read the text they wouldn't be impacted.. I hoped it would be enough.   

But I had my doubts, when I received an instant reply from an old school friend, abusing me for the awful text they'd recieved just before this Facebook message.   

She told me that me pretending my phone had been hacked was not going to get me out of telling her to go kill herself.   
I messaged her back straight away, but she's been inactive ever since.   

It took moments that felt like hours for my phone to ding with a message, and to my relief, the response wasn't a death notice, just a question.  
“Will you meet me at the Quarry?"  
I never hesitated, just simply typed "Yes." and I began walking.  

It was dark, secluded. I felt exposed as I made my way to the figure huddled under the light post.   
She wore a long black coat that hid most of her body, raven hair tucked into a red beret.   
"Max." her smile was dazzling, bright, warm, smeared in lipstick the same shade of red as her hat.   

I didn't say anything, because I didn't kkow her name, although I recognized her from serving me in a cafe when I went there occasionally.   
"Oh, you don't know my name." she gave an awkward laugh, and then introduced herself as Rebecca. She told me she worked at the cafe part time, but she spent most of her time doing witchcraft and trying out spells.   

"It's not, like, anything weird.. like frogs in cauldrons stuff, it's more just saying words and using certain herbs and crystals." she tried to reassure me, but I was more interested in the phone.   
Of her being a witch, or at least being somewhat successful in casting spells.. That made sense, in a strange and surreal way.  
 
But I just wanted the phone.   

"It's our first proper meeting, there's no need to rush things." Rebecca frowned. She must have noticed my impatience and I make a mental note to take it down a notch.   

Instead of wrestling her for the phone, which is what I want to do, I offer we take a walk around the lake. It was a beautiful night, after all.   
Rebecca loved this idea, practically squealing with excitement.   

I half listened as she spoke more about spells, and then she mentioned me.   
“I mean, I know she was your mother and all.. But what about how she used to treat you when you didn't do well on a test? She was a real bitch at times."  

I stared at her, so that's why she had sent the message to my parents, to punish them for their, according to her, apparent downfalls.   
"And my boss?" my voice is cold, hard.   
She stops walking, and turns to face me. She takes her hands in mine.   

"He was bad. Very bad. You never saw that side.. But it was more than doing you a favor, max. It was more like doing the world a favor. Trust me on that."  
I don't trust her. I can't. So I don't say anything, I turn away from her and keep walking in silence.
   
"I want my phone." I'm cold. I'm tired. I've been here for hours, and even though I don't have my phone or logically know the time, somehow I can tell it's later than I should ever be out.   
Rebecca sighs. Not annoyed, more sad.  

"I know you do. I was wanting to see if this was going to work without doing a spell. But I don't think it is. I think we're out of time."  
Fear plucks at my skin hearing that and again for the second or third time today, I find myself contemplating upcoming death.  

I watch in horror as she pulls out a bag. I am expecting to see a knife, maybe a gun, but instead it's a spiral notebook, old and tattered.  
She flicks a few pages through, and rolls her eyes in frustration.  
She murmurs a few words under bated breath, and then slams the book closed.  
"Damn it. Left the other book at home.“  

I don't say anything.  
She sighs loudly again. Shuffles in her handbag for a bit.   
"I've gotta go get some stuff. I need you to stay here." she gestures to a piece of rope in her hands. She ties me by my left hand and right leg to the light pole. I'm like a pretzel, and my back is hurting already.  

She pats me on the head, gives me a smile.   
"I'm not doing this to hurt you. I'm doing it because I love you, Max. I'll be back soon."  
So that's where I'm up to now.  
I think she's going to get another spell book, or maybe a magical bloody dagger, who would know!   

But, I don't think she wants to hurt me.  
No, I think, despite all this... Stuff that's been going on, Rebecca actually seems like a kind and caring girl. I think her hearts in the right place, at least.. Even if her mind isn't.   

I have considered my options for when she returns. I've thought about fighting her, I don't think it would be that hard, getting my phone back and deleting all the contacts it held.. But.. What if it's not just my messages that something odd is going on with.. What if erasing numbers meant also erasing the people too?  

I know it's crazy. I know I should really make a run for it or at least try and untie myself.  
But suddenly I'm exhausted, the kind of tired where I could close my eyes and sleep sitting up.   

I should make a run for it. But I'm not going to. I'm going to wait for Rebecca to get back so she can help me understand it all better. If she's the one whose cast some kind of spell to do this to my phone, maybe I do need her help to figure it all out.   

And like I said before, I'm real tired, and I can't seem to get my legs working that well anyway. They feel like jelly whenever I try and move them. I'm really uncomfortable tied up like this, but at the same time, I feel like I could seriously go a quick little nap. I'll probably just rest up for a bit, while I wait for Rebecca to get back.   
I've had to use my burner phone to type this, now the battery's getting low.   
I'm going to turn it onto aeroplane mode to Hopefully conserve some power.   

I'll update when I can.
