I never thought I’d go back. Not after everything. But there it was—an envelope in my mailbox, thick and formal, with the words “For the sake of harmony.” I hadn’t heard from my family in years. The tone felt off. It was an invite to a family reunion at the old house, deep in the countryside. A place you can only get to by twisting through endless backroads. A place I never missed.

Still, something about the letter nagged at me. Maybe it was curiosity. Maybe guilt. I didn’t know. But the next morning, I packed up and drove out.

The road was worse than I remembered. It twisted through thick trees. Their branches reached out, blocking the sun. The air got heavier, thick with damp earth and something rotten. I kept glancing behind me, feeling like something was there. But every time I looked, it was just trees, still and silent.

When the house finally appeared, I almost regretted coming. It was exactly the same—frozen in time. The old stone mansion surrounded by trees, casting long shadows. A black lake behind it, too still, like it was holding its breath. It all felt wrong, like it was waiting for something.

I pulled up the gravel driveway, tires crunching loud. The house felt alive, watching me. The door opened before I knocked—creaked on its own. As I stepped inside, the air hit me, musty wood and stale air. But there was something else, too. Something sweet. Like the house was breathing, pulling me in.

The family was already there. Too many of them. All dressed too perfectly. Clothes crisp, like they just stepped out of an old portrait. Their smiles were wide, rehearsed. No warmth. Just politeness.

“Welcome back,” Aunt Margery said, syrupy sweet, eyes never quite meeting mine. “So glad you could make it. For the sake of harmony.”

Harmony. The word stuck in my head. It felt wrong. Too repetitive. Hollow.

I nodded, but I couldn’t smile back. There was something off about her, the way she tilted her head like she was studying me. I looked away, but I could feel the others’ eyes on me, too sharp, too observant.

The house felt like it was closing in. I couldn’t tell if it was the walls or the people. My pulse throbbed in my throat. My nerves buzzed. The floor creaked beneath me, but it wasn’t the normal creak. It felt as if the home was living and fitting into its old bones.

I couldn’t shake the feeling something was wrong.

I walked down the hallway, trying to shake it off. But then I saw it. A row of portraits. Faces in the paintings stared down at me, following my every move. Some were smudged, faces scratched out, barely visible. Others were overtaken by vines, crawling over the frames like the plants were alive, trying to escape.

The faces were familiar but wrong. Some I recognized, others I didn’t. I leaned closer to one, air growing colder around it. The face was half-covered in moss, the features still visible. As I stared, the mouth stretched into a grin, too wide. I stepped back, heart pounding.

I kept moving. Maybe I was imagining things.

The rest of the family was in the sitting room, gathered in perfect circles. Laughing too loud, talking too cheerfully. But nothing felt natural. It was all forced. They didn’t ask about me, just the house, the land, and harmony. Every conversation looped back to it like it was the only thing that mattered.

“Harmony is everything,” Uncle Thomas said, flat and emotionless. “Without it, we wouldn’t survive. Without harmony, there’s nothing.”

Nothing? What the hell was that supposed to mean?

I attempted to ignore it, but it was everywhere. The walls, the conversations, the way they moved in sync. It was like a perfect machine. I overheard whispers—“disharmony” and “upholding tradition.” Every time I asked about it, they quickly changed the subject, smiling those cold, practiced smiles.

I needed to leave. Just for a minute. I went out onto the porch, chilly air slamming against my cheeks. But even outside, it didn’t feel right. The trees were too close, their branches heavy with tension, swaying without wind. The lake shimmered, too still. It was like it was waiting for something.

I walked toward the garden, hoping it would help. But the flowers were growing too fast, twisting into strange shapes. The soil was dark, too dark. Like it had soaked up something.

I couldn’t shake the feeling I was being watched.

Then I heard it. A whisper, faint and carried by the wind—or maybe from the trees. It sounded like voices, but there was no one there. No one but me.

I turned back to the house, chest tight. Something was wrong. I felt it deep in my bones. The house wasn’t just a house. The land wasn’t just land. There was something else here, something alive. And it wasn’t letting me go.

I spent the rest of the evening avoiding the worst of the family. It wasn’t hard—no one wanted to talk to me unless it was about the house or the land. The dinner table was quiet, only the sound of silverware against porcelain. Even that felt too loud, too sharp. The air was thick with something unsaid, a tension in the room and in the walls themselves.

I had to get out. The strangest thing was the pull toward the garden, toward the woods beyond. It was like the house wanted me to go there, to see something. I told myself it was just curiosity, the place making me paranoid. But when I looked out the window, the trees seemed to call to me. The lake was too still, wrong. I couldn’t ignore it.

The family disappeared into their rooms, leaving the house eerily quiet. I slipped out the back door, my sneakers crunching on the gravel as I strolled toward the garden. The night air was thick with dampness, and the silence made my skin tingle. No wind. No sound. Just the faintest murmur of something far away.

As I wandered through the garden, I noticed how alive the plants felt. Everything was growing too fast, twisting in unnatural directions. Flowers bloomed and withered in seconds, petals curling like they were trying to escape. Then I saw the trees. They weren’t just trees. I stopped at one, twisted and grotesque. The bark was pale, almost white, with grooves that looked like faces. Faces carved into the wood, so deeply etched they seemed alive. Some looked like they were in pain. One had hollow eyes, staring at me, unblinking. I reached out to touch the bark, and a chill ran up my spine.

I stepped back, heart racing, when I heard a voice behind me.

“Don’t worry. They’re just memories.”

It was Aunt Margery. I hadn’t heard her approach, and her calm, detached voice made me dizzy. She stood just outside the garden, shadows swallowing her figure.

“Memories?” I asked, my voice tight. “What do you mean?”

“They’re part of the land,” she said, her smile slipping into something almost… loving. “The family’s always been tied to it. It’s what keeps us together. Keeps us whole.”

Her words twisted in my head. “Tied to it?” I asked.

She nodded, voice quieter, like she was sharing a dark secret. “Harmony is the key to everything here. The property, the home, and the family. However, when there is discord, action must be taken to restore equilibrium. You understand, don’t you?”

I didn’t. However, the way she gazed at me, like if she knew something old and terrible, made me feel as if I was missing something really essential.

Before I could ask more, she turned and walked back to the house without another word. I stood there, my mind racing. The trees, the faces, the things she’d said. It was too much. I needed answers, but the more I tried to figure things out, the more confused I became.

I proceeded farther into the woods, driven by an odd feeling. The farther I walked, the more I noticed those faces—twisted into the trees and cut into the rocks. The voices started again. Faint whispers, always just out of reach. It was becoming clearer. The land, the house, the family—they were all connected. Not just metaphorically. They were linked.

Then, as if the earth had had enough of my questions, I saw it. A clearing in the woods, glowing with an unnatural light. In the center was an old stone altar, worn and cracked from age. Beside it, a small tree with twisted, gnarled roots, its bark slick and shiny, like it was sweating. I didn’t need to get closer to know something terrible had happened there. My stomach twisted, and I stumbled back, almost tripping over a root.

I was about to turn and run when I heard the voices again—louder now. They weren’t whispers anymore. They were words.

“Come back to us. You belong here.”

I froze. I knew those voices. They felt familiar, but not in a reassuring sense. I'd heard them previously, when I was younger and visited this location with my folks. Faces from the past, which I believed were long gone. But they hadn't left. They were present, in the trees, on the ground, and in the sky.

I turned, heart pounding, and ran back toward the house. My legs felt heavy, like the ground was trying to hold me down. When I reached the porch, I looked back at the woods and the lake—everything was still. Too still.

I pushed the door open and stumbled inside. The family was already gathered in the sitting room, staring at me with that same, unblinking gaze. It was like they’d been waiting.

Uncle Thomas spoke first, his voice smooth but heavy, savoring each word. “I see you’ve found your way to the garden,” he said, his smile wide but vacant. “Good. It is critical to understand where you came from. Where we all come from.”

I had no idea what he meant, but the dread in my gut made me not want to.

Then, as I stood there, trying to understand, the truth hit me.

The family, the house, the land—it wasn’t just some old tradition. They were part of it. The land was them. And I was part of it too—whether I wanted to be or not.

The room seemed to tilt as the truth settled in. The ground beneath me wasn’t just dirt. It was something darker. Something alive. And I was connected to it. To them.

I was starting to understand. But the truth was worse than I could have imagined.

That night, sleep came fitfully. I kept hearing whispers, like a distant chant, just beyond my dreams. The walls of the home appeared to shut in around me. The air was dense with something I couldn't identify. I tried to ignore it, but the wind, creaking floors, and shadows flitting out of the corner of my eye were too much.

I woke to find the house alive with movement. But it wasn’t the usual cheerfulness. No one smiled. The air was heavy with unnerving intensity. Aunt Margery stood by the window, staring out at the garden. The others moved around the house, silent, their actions precise.

Uncle Thomas spoke first when I came downstairs. His voice was low and serious. “It’s time,” he said. “The reunion is almost over. There are still things to be done.”

I didn’t know what he meant. But his words had a dark weight. The house seemed to hum, vibrating under something impending. I tried to push the panic down, but it kept bubbling up.

“I know you’re confused,” Uncle Thomas said. “But don’t worry. You’ll understand soon.”

I didn’t want to understand. I didn’t want any part of this twisted family. But as he spoke, something shifted. The temperature dropped. The air thickened. It was like the house itself exhaled an ancient breath.

The family gathered in the sitting room, their faces unreadable, eyes cold as marble. No one spoke, waiting for me to join them. My heart hammered in my chest as I stepped forward, almost against my will. My feet moved toward the door like they had a mind of their own. I couldn’t stop them.

The door to the garden was open. The breeze conveyed the aroma of moist dirt, something sweet, and something rotting. My gut twisted as the air pressed on me harder than before. But I couldn’t turn back.

Aunt Margery stood at the edge of the yard, hands folded. The others formed a perfect line behind her, their eyes fixed on me, waiting for me to make the next step. But I could not move. My feet were stuck. Every part of me screamed to run.

But I didn’t.

Uncle Thomas stepped forward, eyes sharp and cold. “It’s time for you to join us,” he said. “To restore the balance.”

I tried to protest, scream, run. But my voice failed. The words didn’t come. Instead, I felt a strange calm, like the earth beneath my feet was holding me there, pulling me toward them.

“We’ve been waiting for this,” he continued. “The land, the family… it all depends on you now.”

I didn’t understand. I couldn’t.

But as I looked at their faces—hollow, cold, unblinking—I realized the truth. I was never meant to be part of this family. I was never meant to be alive like they were. This was something else. Something older. The family wasn’t just bound to the house, to the land. They were part of it. And now, I was the missing piece.

Aunt Margery placed her hand gently on my shoulder, her grip tighter than I thought possible. “We’ve all made sacrifices to keep the harmony. Now it’s your turn.”

The air thickened again, swirling around me like a storm. I felt the ground shifting, moving, breathing. There was no turning back. I wanted to scream, run, tear away from them, but the earth beneath me pressed harder, holding me in place.

Uncle Thomas raised his hands, as if preparing for something grand. “Harmony requires sacrifice. Each of us must be offered, in blood and spirit, to restore balance.”

I tried to move, but my body wouldn’t obey. The family circled me, their steps synchronized, their eyes focused on me with suffocating intensity.

I wanted to scream. To run. But the ground whispered.

“We are part of the earth. And you will be, too. For the sake of harmony.”

The family moved as one, their hands reaching for me. They pulled me toward the stone altar at the center of the garden. The twisted tree beside it leaned toward me, its roots stretching out, twitching, alive. My heart pounded as the ritual began. I had no idea what they were saying. The words were ancient, an incantation I couldn’t understand. But somehow, I felt its weight deep in my bones, my soul.

The ground trembled beneath us. Their voices rose and fell in eerie harmony. I could feel something changing, the air crackling with energy. And then, as if the earth demanded it, pain shot through my chest. A deep, burning sensation, as if invisible hands were pulling my blood out of me.

I looked down. The roots had grown, twisting around my legs, my arms. They reached for me, dragging me into the earth. I attempted to scream, but the sound got lodged in my throat. My limbs tensed and locked into place.

The earth pulled me deeper. It wasn’t death. It wasn’t an ending. It was something worse.

As my vision blurred, I saw my reflection in the lake behind the garden. My face was distorted, hollow, as if I were already part of the earth. My body was becoming one with the land.

The whispers returned, no longer distant. They were inside me.

“We are all one.”

In that moment, I understood. There was no escape. I would never be free of them. The family, the house, the land—they were one.

I was one with them [now](https://ko-fi.com/phantompen/commissions).
