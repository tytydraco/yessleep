In February 2001, Grays Harbor County sheriff deputies responded to a 911 call placed by a 7-year-old boy who reported that his best friend was trying to kill his stepsister.



Officers arrived to find a bloodbath. A teenage girl was unresponsive and halfway under the bed. She suffered multiple injuries: Her fingers had been broken, her ankle snapped and folded up under calf, and she had ten puncture wounds approximately 0.5in in diameter across her abdomen. According to one deputy, a large bee crawled out of one of these punctures and took flight.



As first responders stabilized the girl, one EMT caught a glimpse of eyes glinting under the bed.



Upon investigation, the EMT saw nothing except massive claw marks scoring the floor, as well as several deep punctures piercing the floor — punctures that matched the devastating injuries on the girl’s abdomen.



Two months later, a second child called EMS to report that her imaginary friend was “poking out my brother’s eyes.” Upon arrival, responders found a teenager boy with a freshly missing eye, broken fingers, and several large, deep puncture wounds throughout the body. 



Three weeks after that, a young adult called for an ambulance, claiming that his sister’s “insane friend” was trying to kill him. When responders arrived, no victim was onsite. A very hysterical minor in the home claimed that “he pulled my brother under the bed!” The whereabouts of the youth in question remain unknown.



Overall, eight such calls calls would be placed between February 2001 and January 2002.



During the last of these calls, a police officer discharged his weapon at what he claimed was the perpetrator: 



A small, deformed youth with massive claws, bulging eyes, and a mouth that fell so wide he could see straight down into its gullet. 



The suspect was never located, but he left behind a pool of blood on the spot where the officer claimed he fell once shot. 



When tested, the blood’s results were of unknown origin. Not human, not animal, not anything recognizable. The results maintained no matter how many times the sample was tested.



This is how this inmate came to Agency attention, and what eventually led to his capture.



It is important to note that this entity has been utterly uncooperative since capture. Every piece of information that the Agency has learned was done so without the inmate’s cooperation.



Research suggests that this entity has been active for approximately 60 years. Its modus operandi includes targeting a maladjusted child and gaining access to other children via the friendship. The entity is invisible to everyone except its original target until the moment of attack. During the attack, he attempts to drag his target under the closest bed. 



The entity takes the form of a young boy of approximately 8-10 years of age. He has large eyes, an angular face, and exceptionally large hands with long, finger-like appendages that appear somewhat similar to claws. Note that these appendages are powerful and capable of punching through most organic matter with ease.



The inmate wears a loose-fitting white blouse with large buttons, as well as a close-fitting hat with a round brim. His mode of dress is what prompted personnel to assign him the name “Pierrot.”



Research suggest this entity takes another form, but to date no Agency personnel have observed any form but the one described above.



It is important to note that this subject induced severe hysteria in T-Class Agent Rachele B. Her hysteria was temporarily brought under control by the supportive presence of T-Class Agent Christophe W., but by the end of the interview her distress returned and rendered her incapable of proceeding.



Due to the information obtained over the course of this interview, she is scheduled for an urgent debrief with Dr. Wingaryde and Commander Rafael W. once she is sufficiently recovered from her episode.

I liked bees because they scared the people who scared me.



The people who scared me were the people pretending to be my parents. I lived with them. I don’t remember why. I don’t even remember my real parents. I just remember living with the people who were pretending.



My pretend-father was afraid of bees. He was allergic to their venom. He always poisoned the bees and all the other bugs, too. My pretend-mother was happy about that because she hated all bugs, not just bees.



I was afraid of bees, too. The people who scared me were scared of them, so I believed that they were very, very scary. But I also liked them. I wanted to be scary like the bees. I wanted to scare the people who scared me.



But nothing about me was scary.



I was very small and very skinny and I always cried when I got scared. I was scared all the time because of my pretend-parents.



I didn’t have a name. Well, that isn’t true. I had a name, but they never used it so I forgot. My pretend-brother had a name. He had his own bedroom and toys and blankets. I don’t remember his name anymore. It’s been so long since I used it that I forgot.



My pretend parents had lots of rules. I wasn’t allowed to eat unless they fed me, and I wasn’t allowed to cry if they forgot. If I cried, then I wouldn’t get fed for three days. They always made me eat off the floor. Sometimes I was so hungry I licked the floor after.



I wasn’t allowed to leave the house. If I left the house, they would never let me back in and I would starve to death outside in the cold while they stayed in the warm house with food to eat. That’s what they told me, and I believed them.



I wasn’t allowed to have a bed or even a blanket. That made me sad. My pretend-brother had so many blankets, but I wasn’t even allowed to have one. Not even the ones he threw away.



I wasn’t allowed to talk to strangers or even look at them. If I broke that rule, my pretend-parents said they would break my fingers and pull my teeth out. 



But the most important rule, the number one rule, was I always had to do what I was told.



I never broke that rule.



My pretend-parents called me their little puppet because I always did what I was told, even if it was bad. Even if it hurt. And sometimes, doing what I was told hurt. Sometimes they hurt me even if I did what I was told. But they *always* hurt me when I didn’t do what I was told. 



That’s why I always did what I was told, even when it hurt. Even when it made me bleed.



I also hoped that doing what I was told would make me a good boy. My pretend-parents said my pretend-brother got his own room with a bed because he was a good boy. I tried to be a good boy too. I thought that’s how I would get my own room, by doing what I was told. I thought that’s how my pretend-parents would become my real parents.



But no matter how many times I did what I was told, no matter how many times I was the best puppet, I didn’t get my own room.



When I wasn’t doing what I was told, I was locked up in the top of the house. It was very hot there, and very dusty. I sweated so much that the dust and sweat made mud on my skin. It was grey, so sometimes I pretended I was a grey mouse eating cheese in the attic. I had never eaten cheese, only seen it. I used to dream about cheese. Sometimes I woke up crying when I had those dreams.



There were mice in the attic with me. Most of them were scared of me, but one crawled into my hand. Just like you, Wendy. You crawled right into my hand and held it. Why did you run away?



When my pretend-parents found out I was friends with the mouse, they put poison up in the attic and put me down in the basement where it was dark and cold. Every time a mouse died from the poison, they brought it down to make me look at it. I always cried no matter which mouse it was, but I cried hardest when they made me look at the mouse that crawled into my hand. I cried so hard that I wasn’t even making noise, just wheezes. They left her in the basement with me so I had to look at her until she turned into a skeleton. 



One time, after my mouse turned into a skeleton, my pretend-parents made me bleed even though I did what I was told. Then they put me back in the basement.



I wanted to be far away from the basement door, so I crawled over by the wall. My handprints left smears. That gave me an idea. I put my finger in the blood, and then I put it on the wall. It left a mark.



So I started to draw.



Drawing on the wall is bad. Drawing with blood is hard. But I drew on the wall with blood because it made me forget I was bleeding, and it made me forget about my mouse.



The blood dried up pretty soon, so I had to stop drawing.



But that didn’t mean I was done drawing for good.



I stopped being so sad whenever my pretend-parents made me bleed because it meant I would be able to draw later. The more I bled, the more drawing I could do. Sometimes I wanted to draw so much that I *didn’t* do what I was told, just so they would make me bleed more.



I drew a very big picture all over the wall. It was a drawing of a magic city full of giant bees. I drew their stingers really big, as big as swords so they could stab my enemies. Even though I was afraid of bees, I pretended I lived in the bee city because it was a place my pretend-parents would never come to.



But then my pretend-parents saw the drawing, and they made me hurt. They made me hurt when I did what I was told, so I stopped doing what I was told. They hurt me so bad I started doing what I was told again. They kept hurting me anyway.



When they were done I was so angry and so scared that I smeared all my blood all over the drawing to erase it. I didn’t need a city. I needed a door. A way out.



So in the corner of the wall, in the only place where I didn’t draw the city, I drew a door. A little one, a door that was almost too small even for me so my pretend-parents wouldn’t be able to fit through it. 



Then I drew a blood-bed with blood blankets on the floor by the door, and went to sleep.



A creaking sound made me wake up. I thought it was my pretend-parents coming to make me do what I was told, so I opened my eyes.



I saw that the blood door had turned into a real door.



And it was open.



I couldn’t see the room inside it, but I saw light. Golden lights and colorful lights, like afternoons in summer and the Christmas tree I wasn’t allowed to touch at the same time. It was so beautiful.



Then something huge came crawling by, blocking the light.



For a second I thought it was a bug, but it was way too big. Much bigger than a bug, or me, or my pretend-father even.



Then it stopped and looked at me.



I screamed, and then got panicked. I didn’t know what I was more afraid of — the big thing crawling behind the blood door, or my pretend-parents hearing my scream and coming to tell me what to do.



Then the big thing crawled forward, squeezing himself into the doorway until his face was close to mine. It was a weird face. Big and square, with black paint on his lips and white skin and eyes as blue as the sky.



He propped his chin on his hand and said, “What are you doing, little boy? Opening my front door without even knocking? Tsk, tsk.”



I was so scared I cried.



The big man pouched out his lip and crossed his ankles. I saw the shadow it made, like a stretched-out X, on my blood blanket. “Oh, don’t cry, little boy. Please don’t cry! I was only joking!”



But I couldn’t help it. I was so afraid, and he was so scary. Besides, I didn’t know what he meant. I didn’t know what joking was. I had never heard that word. “What’s joking?”



The man’s mouth fell open. His painted black lips scared me, but they looked funny too. Like he was a clown or a doll.



Or a puppet.



Just like me. 



“You poor child. You poor, poor boy.” He reached out with a hand bigger than my head and patted my arm. I flinched. I knew *that* word, because my pretend-parents often punished me for flinching.



But the scary man didn’t punish me for flinching. He didn’t even yell at me.



He only cried.



His eyes filled with tears. They shone in his eyes like melted silver. They didn’t look real. But I didn’t know that, because even though I cried a lot, I never saw anyone else cry so I didn’t know what tears looked like.



“What’s wrong?” I asked



He wiped his eyes. The silvery tears hung onto his fingers and slid down slowly, like they were dancing. They looked pretend, but when he flicked them off and they landed on me, they felt real. Just like my own tears when they fell on my skin. 



“I’m sorry for crying. It’s just that a little boy who doesn’t know what a joke is is *very* sad business.” His voice sounded thick and sad but so funny. So funny it made me laugh even though I was afraid.



Then the scary man reached down and pulled up the edge of my blanket off my bed, and he blew his nose.



*That* wasn’t funny at all. 



At first I thought it wasn’t funny because it was gross and it was *my* blanket. Snot is gross. I know about snot.



But then I remembered it wasn’t funny because the blanket wasn’t real. It was just a blood blanket on a blood bed that I drew on the hard floor.



Only it wasn’t a blood blanket anymore. It was real. The bed too. Real just like the blood door.



Before I could stop myself, I wondered if my bee city was real, too.  But I was too scared to ask that. Instead I just asked again, “What’s joking?”



He blew his nose again. “A joke is something funny. Something that makes you laugh.”



“I get in trouble if I laugh.”



He crooked his hand and put his chin in it again. He was so big and he didn’t really look like people. He looked like something pretending to be people. It was very scary.



But my pretend-parents were scary, and they were people who were not pretending to be people. They really were just people.



So I thought maybe something pretending to be people would be safer.



“In my City Bright,” said the big man, “we tell jokes every day. More jokes than anyone could tell in a lifetime.”



“Are there bees there? In your city?”



He held his hands out. “Many bees. Bees everywhere you look. As many bees as there are jokes. And nobody, nowhere in the entire city, who will ever stop you from laughing. Least of all me.” He pulled a funny face. Even though it was funny, it gave me goosebumps. But I laughed. “See? I can make you laugh. It will be my life’s work to make sure you laugh every day!”



He scooted backward, shuffling out to clear the doorway. “Come in,” he said. “Come into my city and I will teach you about jokes.”



But I was afraid. I was so afraid I started to cry, because I thought my pretend-parents would find out about this and come down to tell me what to do.



Then I thought that maybe the big scary man was a trick. That my pretend-parents were using him to trick me into talking to strangers. That I’d crawl through the door and they would be waiting for me and make me bleed everywhere for talking to strangers and trying to leave.



I started to cry again because I was so scared.



He started to cry again too, which scared me even more.



I was just *sure* that my pretend-parents were waiting for me. I was too afraid to move. All I could do was sit there and cry and wait for them to come out and tell me what to do.



The big scary man crawled away so I couldn’t see him anymore. I thought he was getting my pretend-parents. Telling them how bad I was. How I talked to strangers. How I tried to leave.



I was so scared that even though I was crying, I wasn’t making any sounds. It was hard to breathe. I was wheezing, like when they showed me my mouse who crawled into my hands. Have you ever been too scared to scream? I have, lots of times. But that was the time I was more scared than ever. 



Suddenly the scary man crawled back, wriggling like a worm on his elbows because his hands were folded. They were folded in a circle, like this. I used to fold my hands this way when I was holding my mouse.



The scary man gave me a smile, then opened his hands.



I flinched.



Bees flew out.



They were shiny like his tears, and big. Big like my thumb.



And when I saw them, I knew the scary man wasn’t my pretend-parents. My pretend-parents would never be friends with anyone who touches bees. 



So I wasn’t afraid anymore.



“I have other business to attend to,” the big scary man said. “But I don’t want to leave you alone, so take these bees and have a very good night, my son.”



He scrunched backward through the door and closed it.



I held the bees in my hand like the scary man did until I started falling asleep. I let them go and they crawled away. I saw their shiny silver bodies wriggle and burrow into the walls, just like the big scary man wriggled backward through the blood door.



I smiled and went to sleep.



When I woke up, the door was just a blood door again, and my bed was just a blood bed, but my blanket was still real.



My pretend-parents came downstairs to tell me what to do. When they saw the blanket, they thought I stole it from my pretend-brother and hurt me so bad I couldn’t even use my blood to draw anymore.



I stayed on the floor all day. It was so cold I shivered. Shivering hurt, but I couldn’t stop.



After it got dark, I saw lights in the wall. Golden skinny lights, like when light comes through cracks under doors. It was the blood door. It was real again. 



It opened. The scary man was behind it. He smiled and waved, but I just tried to crawl away. “Go away,” I said. “You got me in big trouble.



He didn’t go away. He reached out and grabbed my arm.



I flinched.



“Who did this to you?” the scary man asked.



I told him everything.



At the end, he clicked his tongue. The shiny bees came crawling out of the burrows in the wall and walked onto me. 



They stung me.



It didn’t hurt, though. Not at all. The stings just made me feel better.



They stung and stung until all the blood was gone and I didn’t hurt anymore at all.



Then the big scary man invited me through the blood door. He held out his hand.



I took it.



He pulled me through. It was like being on a water slide. I didn’t know what that was then, but I do now because there are waterslides behind the blood doors. I used to play on them all the time before you caught me.



Behind the blood door was the most beautiful and most horrible place I have ever seen. I loved it but I hated it. I wanted to go inside it but I wanted to run away and never see it again, even if that meant going back to my pretend-parents and doing what I was told.



It was just too much, and it made me cry.



The big scary man slapped his forehead. “Stupid, stupid! I took you to the *grownup* city. You need to go to the playground!”



“What’s a playground?”



That made the big man cry big silvery tears again.



When he was done crying, he took me to the playground.



It was wonderful and wondrous. That’s how he described it, and he was right. He’s always right. It never got dark. It never got cold. It was full of golden light and waterfalls and treehouses and playhouses and tunnels and burrows and secret hideaways.



Best of all, there were bees everywhere.



But I did not see any other children.



“Are there other kids?” I asked.



He slapped his head again and made a big surprised face with his blue eyes and black lips. “Of course! A boy needs friends! How could I forget? Sometimes you forget things when you’re old. I forget a lot of things, so I must be getting very old!” He shook his head and sighed. “That’s what we dads are, you know — old!”



“Are you a dad?”



“Of course! I’m *your* dad!”



That made me so happy that I laughed.



I laughed for a long time. That’s when I started to understand about jokes, when I was so happy I couldn’t stop laughing. That was such a good joke.



The big scary man was a good dad. He showed me around the playground and then he took me to a school because that’s where friends are.



Only I never saw a school before. I had never met any kids except my pretend-brother, so I didn’t know what to do. There were so many of them and it was so loud. I got scared and sat down in the middle of the sidewalk and had to try very hard not to cry.



When he saw how scared I was, my new dad apologized. No one ever apologized to me before. It made me so happy I cried, then hugged him and told him it was okay and he didn’t need to apologize. He said, “Of course I have to! Apologies are the right thing to do when you’re wrong., always” 



He was right. My new dad is always right. 



Then he took me away from the school and we went somewhere I did recognize: A bedroom. A nice one like my pretend-brother had.



There was a little girl in the bed.



We woke her up and took her under the bed to the playground. 



She was scared when she saw my new dad. She was scared when she saw me. She was scared when we brought her to the playground in Bee City. She was scared when I told her to stop being scared.



But she wasn’t scared after the bees stung her.



We played for a long time. I don’t know how many days, because the sun never goes down there.



But when I was finally done playing, my friend looked sick. You could see all her bones and her eyes looked like stars and her mouth was so, so big and it wouldn’t stay shut. There were holes in her, too. So many holes from all the bee stings.



Since my friend couldn’t play anymore, I gave her to the bees. They crawled into all the holes from all the stings and buzzed. The humming sounded like singing. Quiet singing. I didn’t know the word yet, but it sounded like a lullaby. I know that word now, and that’s definitely what it sounded like:



A lullaby.



The bees made honey, too. Golden shiny honey, just like the light. It dripped out and made the grass sticky.



When the bees got done making honey, my friend crawled into secret tunnel under the playhouse and started to sing. The way she sang made me laugh. A joke. My dad told me there were lots of jokes in Bee City, and he was right. He’s always right.



My new dad helped me find lots of friends after that. 



It was fun.



I always laughed when they were scared, and I laughed when the bees stung them to make them stopped being scared. I laughed at the funny ways they played. It was so many jokes, just like my new dad said, and my new dad is always right. 



But slowly, it stopped being funny and I stopped laughing at the jokes.



I didn’t like how my friends were all scared at first. It reminded me of how I got scared whenever I got told what to do by my pretend-parents. It made me think that maybe, I wasn’t making friends.



Maybe I was just telling them what to do.



I don’t want to tell anybody what to do. I just want friends. Real friends. You were my real friend, Wendy. So why did you run away?



When the bees started making honey inside my fifth friend, I told my new dad I didn’t want to do this to my friends anymore.



“Who will you play with, if not friends?”



I thought I was going to say *nobody*, but I was wrong.



Instead of saying *nobody*, I smiled a little. “My brother.”



My new dad gave me a very weird look. He leaned in with one eye big — I don’t know how else to say it, he just leaned down and got close until his big eye was almost touching mine.



Then he smiled big. Big as a wolf.



“Let’s get the boy his brother!”



He took me to my pretend-brother’s bedroom. I always wanted his bedroom, remember? I was so jealous that he was a good boy and that I was a bad boy even though I always did what I was told. I did what I was told because I thought that’s how you get your own room. I thought that’s how pretend-parents turn into real parents.



It isn’t.



That’s what my new dad told me, and he was right. My new dad is always right. 



My pretend-brother was very scared when he saw us and even more scared when he took him under the bed to get to the playground, but just like all the others he stopped being scared when the bees stung him. I laughed when he stopped being scared. It was funny. It was a good joke, just like my new dad said. He was right. He’s always right.



I played with my pretend-brother for a long, long, long time.



Finally he fell down, and I gave him to the bees.



I made sure he was full of bees. Fuller than any of my other friends. I turned him into a beehive. I turned him into a honeycomb. My new dad said he was colonized. 



I let him sing afterward, but I didn’t let him crawl into the playhouse under the tunnel because I had a different idea.



But I wasn’t sure it was a good idea, so I asked my new dad for advice. 



When I told him, he hugged me and said it was the best idea he’s ever heard. And my new dad is always right.



Then my new dad drew me a blood door right back into my old basement.



I put my pretend-brother on the basement floor. Honey leaked from all the honeycomb holes and from his eyes. 



Then I hid in the corner and waited for my pretend-parents to come downstairs to tell me what to do. 



When my pretend-father came downstairs and saw my pretend-brother, he screamed and screamed and screamed.



And that was *before* he saw the bees.



They weren’t big bees, but they all had big, long stingers, just like my blood drawings.



When the bees were done with him, he didn’t look like my pretend-father.



He didn’t even look *pretend* anymore. He looked like something else. Something too scary to be a monster but also too silly to be scary. Lumpy and so many different bruise colors. His lip swelled so big it was almost as big as my hand, and one of his eyelids looked like a big lumpy ball. All of him was like that. All of him was so swollen and so lumpy. So scary.



But so silly, too.



When he stopped moving, the bees crawled back into my pretend-brother and kept making more honey. They made so much it dripped out of the holes and made a big puddle that spread all the way across the floor and touched my feet.



I dipped my finger in it and ate it until my pretend-mother came. 



Her screams were even worse. They made me laugh so much. I think her screams were the best joke I ever heard. 



Wendy, I told you about that joke, remember? After you told me I didn’t live in Bee City, I lived in Neverland. I told you about all the jokes. You didn’t laugh, though. Is that why you ran away, Wendy? Because no one told you what jokes are?



Wendy, why did you run away?



You won’t run away again. My new dad promised.



And my new dad is always right.



\* \* \*



This is all kinds of fucked up and I don’t know where to start. It almost makes me wish I could interview myself just to get my thoughts straight, but I can’t.



I grew up in and out of foster care. My third foster home was bad. Not the worst, but still bad. The kind where the kids aren’t allowed any autonomy at all. You couldn’t eat, sleep, bathe, get dressed, or even pee except at scheduled times. I had never felt so out of control in my life. 



To cope, I brought back the imaginary friend I’d had when I super, super small. Not because I really believed in him — I was seven years old by that point, and had known what was real and what wasn’t for much longer — but because it was literally the only way to have something that my foster family could not control.  



As a kid, my favorite movie was Peter Pan. I definitely see the appeal that the whole “escaping into a magical realm run by kids where the only villains are grown ups” held for a kid in my situation, but I didn’t think too deeply about it. I only bring it up because I named my imaginary friend after him. When I brought him back in that foster home, I kept the name.



Anyway.



At first Peter was just a carbon copy of the cartoon. He was invisible to everyone but me. No one could hear him except me. I never had to talk out loud to him, because he could read my thoughts. This made it so we could play games all day every day, and no one could stop me.



It was innocent at first, but it got really weird really fast.



Almost immediately he insisted he came from a place called Bee City. I found that supremely irritating because he was Peter Pan, and everyone knows Peter Pan comes from Never Never Land. I told him so. I also lied about my name, and told him my name was Wendy and that anybody calling me different was lying.



He stopped looking like cartoon Peter too. He was still a little boy in a hat, but he was a real-looking little boy with like…a round hat and big wings. Not feathery wings, but wings like a bug. He had sad eyes, so sad that after a while I didn’t like looking at him even though he was pretend.





After all this happened, I didn’t think about it that much. I assumed that his steadily darker character was simply a reflection of how I was feeling at the time. I felt out of control, so he got more out of control. I was scared, so he got scary. Common sense, right? Literally a projection of what was going on inside me.



One day, Peter hurt one of my foster siblings for calling me by my real name instead of Wendy. I stopped him. But because he was invisible, everyone thought it was me and I got in massive trouble. While they figured out what to do with me, they put me out in the yard and forced me to hang wet bedding out to dry in the cold. That’s a form of torture. Especially for a second-grader who can’t even reach the clothesline without jumping. Don’t believe me? Give it a shot, then come back to talk to me.



While I was hanging laundry, Peter came back. I told him I didn’t want to see him, so he said, “Let’s do jokes instead” and started hiding behind the sheets. It was so fucking creepy.



So creepy I basically forgot he wasn’t real.



I was mad at him for not leaving, so I started chasing him. Pulling the sheets off the lines so he wouldn’t have anywhere to hide. But he was always faster than me, flitting back and forth. Every time I saw his shadow, I tore a sheet down only to see that shadow behind another sheet. 



That’s when I remembered something about Peter Pan. About how his shadow isn’t always attached to him. How it can peel away and do its own thing.



And somehow I knew he was behind me. Had been this whole entire time. I just knew.



I dropped the freezing sheet in my hands and turned around.



Peter stood there, half-hidden by the last billowing sheet, smiling. But he didn’t look like Peter. He looked like a monster. Worse than a monster. An insectile, corrupted, not even human, with a wraparound smile dripping honey.



I screamed and ran, tripping over the sheet. It tangled around my ankles and I fell face first in the cold mud, but I got up and kept running.



That was the worst trouble I’ve ever gotten in.



Ever.



Hurting a fake sibling? Bad.



Not doing chores? Worse.



Tearing all the clean bedding off the clotheslines and dropping them in the mud? Worst.



The trouble I got into was so bad — and the terror that came with being in trouble so acute — that it actually kind of drove Peter out of my head. I was hysterical, so scared I felt I was within an inch of my life from this monster hunting me in the backyard.



But he still wasn’t as scary as my foster parents. So scared that when I started flashing back during that interview, that’s what I was afraid of. Isn’t that insane?





Anyway, during and especially after the interview, I was a wreck. Like this dredged up memories I didn’t even realize I still had. I wanted out. I tried to get out. You know who tried to let me out?



Christophe.



You know who shoved me right back in?



Charlie.



You know who shoved Charlie out of the way and came in and sat with me until the interview was done?



Yeah, I was surprised too.



He actually kept me pretty calm. Calm enough until Peter — Pierrot — called me Wendy.



And then I just *lost* it.



I don’t even remember all that much, except for Christophe bellowing and Charlie placating and Commander Wingaryde — where did he even come from? — yelling about the Harlequin and how had no one ever made the connection?



At some point after that I just sort of came into awareness again, almost like I’d been under twilight anesthesia.



I was in a chair in the dining area, painfully aware of a dozen staff members looking on as I sobbed my heart out. Christophe was kneeling beside, holding and rubbing my hands the way my mom used to when I was sick. The way I knew his own mother had once held his hands after she’d scared him to death.



Unbidden, I remembered the cryptic warning I’d received just yesterday: *Christophe is the only one who gives a shit about any of the inmates, including you.*



I almost pulled away anyway, but I was so desperate for any comfort that I squeezed back.



When he noticed, he said, “What happened? You know that thing? That boy?”



I shrugged. “I…he was my imaginary friend when I was little.”



The searching look he gave me was so un-Christophelike that for a second I wondered if it was something pretending to be him. “Did you know he was here?”



“I didn’t even know he was *real*.”



That look again. “Why did he call you Wendy?”



For the first time since I walked into the interview room, my instinct kicked in. The one that tells me what to say and how to say it in order to get something beneficial to me.



And without even thinking, I threw one of Christophe’s myriad creeptastic retorts back in his face:



“We can talk later, but only if you’re brave enough to come to me all alone.”



He looked as if I’d slapped him.



Then the shock cracked apart and he started laughing. 



So did I.



By this point everyone — and by “everyone,” I mean about about a dozen other personnel trying to eat their lunch in peace — was watching us, so I got up to leave.



Christophe followed.



“I’m okay,” I said immediately.



“You’re lying. Even if I am wrong, the commander is going to come for you and he won’t care that you’re not okay. Do you want to talk to him now?”



“Um…no…?”



“Then I will keep him away until you feel better.”



“Why are you doing this?” I asked.



“Making sure all of you feel safe is part of my work. It is the only part I like.” He tapped his jaw. “The only part that doesn’t need teeth.”



He sounded so earnest that I didn’t even have the heart to tell him he is the only thing in the Pantheon that always makes me feel unsafe. 



He walked me to my room, patted me awkwardly on the shoulder, and headed back to the front of the hallway, ostensibly to head off Commander Wingaryde.



It’s been a few hours, and to his credit he’s kept everyone away.



I don’t even know why I’m procrastinating. It’s not like I’ll figure any of this out without talking to somebody who knows more, and I do want to know.



But I'm also afraid of what I'm going to find out.



And I still have no idea what to think about anything. Not about Peter — Pierrot — and what that means, or what the agency knows about me that I don’t, or what they're going to do to me, or what this means for our upcoming Harlequin hunt.



And I certainly no longer know what to think about Christophe. 



On one hand, the person who told me to be Christophe’s friend clearly knew what he was talking about.



On the other, I will literally never be able to forget what he’s done or what he is.



As terrible as it feels to admit, though, having a big bad wolf as a guard dog is probably not the worst development at this point.
