I think my ex is waiting for us, but where?

Alright, I’m used to having weird dreams. Happens almost every night. Always vivid. My child’s father who passed (he was a train hopper) appears in my dreams every now and then. He usually seems to know what’s going on and I’m just wondering what he’s been up to. He doesn’t talk much in my dreams. He used to talk a lot. 

This time was a bit different. Before I explain this, how can your own mind throw you through a plot twist? This only happens in my dreams.

So it starts off in a very unfamiliar but scenic countryside place. No where around looked close to “home”. I was lost, but didn’t feel unsafe. I quickly noticed train tracks in this beautiful area, and waited for a train. Eventually a train came by, and the conductor just told me not to worry, that he will get me to where I need to be. I trusted him. He seemed to know me somehow, but I didn’t know him. I had the feeling he’s been controlling this train for a while.

I looked outside of the old steam train after getting on and in the distance I could see him (my ex) standing there. I told myself “hey isn’t that..” and the conductor stops me and says “yeah that’s spike, we know him well”. He didn’t get on, just stood there waiting for god knows what.

I eventually arrived at what seemed like a family owned hotel and was greeted by the family. All women for some reason. They were just telling me I could stay as long as I needed to.

I woke up and told my husband about this, and he said “this sounds a lot like the fairy man”. I rubbed my eyes and responded “what fairy?!”. It took me a moment to realize who he was talking about. Naturally, I was left with more questions. Why was my ex not getting on this train? Was this heaven for him? Why did he say he was familiar with him, that must mean he’s met this guy before, but maybe he’s waiting for something (possibly our child he left behind). Or is he in limbo… refusing to move on.

I’m Jewish, so I don’t “believe” in hell. He, on the other hand, was a satanist. 

I don’t know, but there was way too much meaning to this dream to be my imagination. It couldn’t have been. 

This is 100% real, this is [Spike](https://youtu.be/zNG2ywZw3VQ?si=RqmmICpsDj3kuWxI) before
his passing. He passed August of 2020. He was a train hopping tattoo artist who now haunts my dreams.

When my two best friends passed as a kid (both tragically from car accidents), they visited my dreams, told me goodbye, and moved on. He still visits though. I don’t know why, and he never says anything. I’m not a huge believer in ghosts, though I do live in NV now, so we’ve seen some shit out here. 

He travelled all over the country, and left his presence everywhere. He was a very good person, he just suffered with his own demons. Theres just something about this “dream” that does sit right with me. I think he needs my help or some guidance, but how, without practicing something that goes against my religion entirely?
