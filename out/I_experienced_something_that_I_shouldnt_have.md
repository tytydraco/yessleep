It all started terribly.



My phone displayed Dana, my best friend’s name, for the 4th time. 



“Shit, shit”, I cursed under my breath, frantically searching through my closet. Of course, I couldn't find anything decent to wear. “She’s gonna kill me for sure.” After 5 minutes of relentless digging, I grabbed some clothes and changed quickly (guess what, I wore the shirt inside out at first. Lovely). Murphy’s law had been in action since the morning began- I woke up late despite being a light sleeper, the phone charger wasn’t plugged in, I didn’t prepare anything beforehand for the stayover at Dana’s house, you know the drill. I was supposed to be there at 4 pm, but now it was almost past 5. The fact that she lived quite far didn’t help either. Taking a deep breath, I started stuffing the duffel bag with whatever I could get my hands on. When my phone started ringing again, I put it on speaker.



“ You coming on a plane or something?” Dana’s exasperated tone boomed.

“ I’m sor-”

“Have you even got out?”

“ Yeah well-”

She sighed. “ The weather’s getting bad. Just come fast, will ya?”



By the time I left, dark clouds were already rolling in, bringing occasional cold gusts of air. I hurriedly called a taxi and jumped in, praying for the rain to come pouring down after I reached. I texted Dana that I was on my way. I got a thumbs up as a response. A sign that she was super mad. I reclined on the seat, staring at the window. Thankfully, there wasn’t much traffic, allowing me to reach within 45 minutes. Just as I entered her apartment gate, I heard the pitter-patter of rain . A lucky moment indeed.



Dana lived on the 7th floor of a residential apartment building. There was only one week left until our semester break was over. We did plan to have a sleepover before, but it never came to fruition. Finally, we agreed on a date after much discussion. I pressed the elevator button. I didn’t quite enjoy riding elevators. That claustrophobic sensation, the gentle humming, the slight jerk that you sometimes felt in the pit of your stomach. Oh, the electricity too. Nevertheless, my lazy ass would rather stand for an hour but not climb up the stairs. The machine reached the ground floor with a cheery “DING”. I went in, suddenly feeling a bit nervous. The 7th floor button lit up and with a quick thump the elevator began to ascend. The interior had mirrored walls with a green carpeted floor. The lack of handrails made it a bit risky, though. I fixed my hair and waited for the door to open. Instead of stopping at the designated floor, it kept going up. 



The hell? 



The display flashed level 9.



The apartment only had 8 floors.



I frantically pressed the emergency button to no avail. My phone showed no signal at all. My brain couldn’t register what was happening. How was this even possible? With shaking hands, I tried to call Dana despite knowing it wouldn’t work. Texts were not being sent, either. Beads of sweat crept down my forehead. The elevator’s speed increased, making a “WHOOSH” sound.



 Everything started to spin.



I leaned on the wall and put my hand on it with as much pressure as I could. It felt as though the walls were closing in on me. Hot tears rolled down my face. I noticed that my breath was fogging up. When did it get so chilly?



The screen now flashed 50 in ominous, bold red numbers. The lights flickered slightly, threatening to go out any second. I sat on the floor, whimpering. 



And then, it stopped.



It occurred with such force that I almost crashed into the door. The elevator stood extremely still, the mechanical whirring being replaced by eerie silence. I was scared to make any sound. I placed my hand on the cold steel, sending shivers down my spine.



The door moved.



I squealed, backing away from the door. I slowly stood up and stared at the darkness ahead of me.



Absolute pitch black.



The light in the elevator didn’t help much in illuminating the outside. My whole body trembled like a leaf.

 

Should I even step out?



God knew what was waiting in the inky blackness. I contemplated turning on the flashlight, but didn’t for now. Wiping my face, I took a deep breath and stepped forward carefully (Don’t blame me, what else could I have done)? The floor underneath my shoes felt rock solid, and weirdly enough, my feet could sense the coldness through the rubber sole. The silence was so overwhelming that I could hear blood rushing through my veins. With sweaty palms, I turned up my phone’s brightness and held it up. 



The place looked like a garage, empty and derelict. The peeling yellow walls were covered with stains that oddly resembled dried blood (I sure as hell hoped that wasn’t the case). Strange red markings covered the entirety of the concrete floor, something of a madman’s gibberish doodles. The longer I walked, the more the darkness hung like a cloak around me. Why was this damn thing not end-



A sound.



Low growling.



I froze. It came from a corner, exactly where my phone’s light was shining. 



It was a human.



Well, not quite a human. It was crouched on all fours, shaking back and forth like a pendulum. Blue, thin veins crisscrossed its hands, pulsating. Long, matted hair covered its face. The skin was so white it was almost glowing. Bones were poking out from all angles. I instinctively yelped, almost dropping my phone. That…thing raised its head in a flash, gazing at me with opal black eyes. 



It smiled.



It fucking smiled. Too many rows of sharp teeth. No nose.



It convulsed violently, producing a loud screeching noise. 



I noped the hell out of there and started sprinting.



The faint outline of the elevator seemed thousand miles away, now radiating a crimson aura. I could hear that thing running just behind me accompanied by a metallic, wet sound, its hot breath tickling my ankles. I didn’t want to imagine what would happen to me if it caught me.



Suddenly, I heard a “DING!”



The elevator doors made a slight movement. 



My legs felt like lead, waiting  to collapse any moment. The air tasted sour in my mouth. Every cell in my body screamed to get away from that thing. 



3.



It let out a wail, its hand almost touching my leg.



2.



The doors began to close.



1. 



Through the tiny gap, I shot inside like a bullet.



Just before they closed, I saw the thing jump a foot above the ground, ready to pounce. 



BANG.



Its body slammed against the metal, shaking the whole elevator. I sat down hyperventilating, gasping for air like a fish out of water. The dim lights became brighter, the numbers returned to normal. I clutched my duffel bag tightly. Through my blurry vision, I looked at the time on my phone.



6.05 pm.



The exact time I got inside. 



I was descending.



It stopped on the 7th floor. The relief that passed through my body when Dana’s door showed up was otherworldly.



 I came out as fast as I could, not caring how hideous I probably looked. 



Safe to say, I don’t ride elevators anymore.
