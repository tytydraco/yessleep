Memories are mysterious things.. Sometimes events that seemed normal in the past seem different through the lens of age. Overlooked details seem more important looking back, and things that made sense in the mind of a child are troubling to an adult. 

I was nine the summer when my family moved to the country, a property in between red deer and Calgary, Alberta. 
 
To a nine year old raised in the suburbs,  the nearly 200 acres of prairie and forest was almost the biggest thing I could imagine, it seemed like it never ended. 

My mother, father, brother,  sister, and our beloved dog buster all piled in the van and drove out for the first time, optimistic and hopeful about our change from city life. We were an average family, we loved each other, and that was enough. 

My sister Margaret  was a year younger than me, and my brother Max was only five. Some of my earliest memories are playing make-believe hobbits with my siblings, staying up late talking in our bunk bed with my brother, or crying when my sister occasionally beat me in mario kart. We went to church on Sunday, we spent time with each other, and  my parents loved each other so much ; all in all I had a beautiful childhood.

   By the time we finally arrived at the new house  all the kids including me bolted out of the van to see our new home, and more importantly to claim the best rooms before anybody else could, but my parents stepped in and informed us that the boys would be sharing, and my sister would 
get her own room. 

All our stuff was going to arrive after a few days, so after exhausting the novelty of the house, I decided I wanted to do a little bit of exploring. I asked my parents if I could go play outside before dinner, they said yes and I was on my way.

 Trails passed throughout the property but I wasn't really interested in that. Between the highway and our house there was a couple kilometres of dense forest, and I remembered my dad telling me about a creek down there, so naturally I headed in that direction.

 I remember loving that forest from the moment I stepped foot in it, the trees forming a canopy over me, the moss and twigs forming a soft bed beneath my feet, the feeling that I was in one of my fantasy books on an ancient quest ; I was in love.

 I went deeper and deeper in, noticing little landmarks as I passed through, a tree with a weird shape, small hills and valleys, random burned out fire pits, probably from teenagers causing trouble years ago. 

Eventually a clearing ahead caught my eye, and I approached to investigate. That was when I found it. There was a small clearing, not more than twenty square feet, and in the centre there seemed to be a small man made structure. 

The trees seemed to have been cut in the shape of a diamond, or more likely they were planted that way. The small structure was dead centre, in the exact middle of the diamond. 

It looked like a small well, like the kind you see in cartoons. Bricks in the shape of a circle, about 3 feet high, but unlike a well, there was no roof on top of the bricks, no bucket to collect water. 

When I approached and looked into the centre, all I saw was blackness, the hole within this well thing seemed to go on forever, however deep it was I couldn't see the bottom. 

Being a child I immediately threw a rock down the hole to see how deep it was, but to my surprise, I didn't hear anything hit the bottom. Thinking it must've just not weighed enough to hear it, I tried again with a much bigger rock, but again, I was left in suspense. 

Either way I thought it was very cool. My imagination was running wild at the idea of a bottomless pit, probably only a kilometre into my backyard. I hung around for a while and then made my way back home. 

When I got home I immediately told my dad what I'd found, I was really excited and wanted to know if he knew what it was. “You probably just found an old well that used to be used to get water out here in the olden days” he said, far less excited than me.

 “There used to be plenty of homesteaders around this area before any cities were really established in the province, so you probably found an old well from one of those properties”. 

His answer satisfied me for the most part but I was still in awe of how deep it seemed to go. I thought about telling him it seemed like it was bottomless but decided he wouldn't believe me. 

Over the next few months I would visit that place (affectionately named the hole by me) and hang out, poke around, or imagine just how far down it really goes. My childish imagination went wild with possibilities but never once did I suspect something negative, only fun ideas like that the hole lead to china or the center of the earth. 

For a time, everything was normal, at least as normal as moving away from everything you know can be. My brother and I would walk our dog around the property and talk about video games while my sister hung out in her room and read. It was a quieter life than I was used to, but I was learning to accept it. 

My brother didn't speak much, he was the type of child that adults would say was “very grown up” and “mature” for his age. What they really meant by this is that he was orderly and he wasn't noisy, but to other kids something about him always seemed off. He rarely smiled and especially not after we moved. 

I loved him to death anyways, but sometimes I looked into his eyes and couldn't help but feel nobody was home. He was somewhere else, anywhere but present. 

In the blink of an eye two months had passed and September was rolling in. I've always loved the way the leaves look in the fall, and I spent extra time outdoors, trying to soak up any last warmth the air could offer me before winter set in. 

Looking back I  sometimes wish I would've been more like my sister, spent time inside and not been so curious, maybe then everything would have been fine. Maybe then I wouldn't be dealing with everything I am now. 

Maybe there were strange incidents before this one, I don't know, but the first real time I knew something weird was going on on our property was on my birthday, September 5th. 

I begged my mom to let me stay home from school on my birthday, and much to my surprise, she allowed it. I was ecstatic. Not only did I get to spend my entire birthday away from stupid school, but I also got to be home alone all day, which always made me feel like a real grown up. 

When my parents left for their respective workplaces (my Dad at his law firm and my Mom at the vet office) they told me to leave the dog in his kennel when they were gone, and to stay inside until they were back. Naturally I  ignored both commands, and I freed the dog and took him with me outside as soon as they left.

 We played fetch in the yard a little bit, then hung out by the hole for a while, and eventually I decided I wanted to check the mailbox, thinking maybe my grandparents sent me a birthday card. 

The mailbox was about a kilometre down the road, and I was used to walking beside the road to get to it with my parents, so I figured everything would be fine. There aren't often cars on that road anyway so I wasn't worried. I threw the leash on the buster and we went on our way. 

I was tossing the tennis ball we had been playing fetch with up and down in my left hand, and holding the leash in my right hand. I remember hearing a car in the distance but not really thinking anything of it, why would I? I had a nice rhythm going tossing and catching the ball, when for whatever reason I  accidentally dropped it. It rolled into the middle of the road. Buster's head immediately perked up, and he bolted after it. 

The leash yanked my arms, and I couldn't hold on with my nine year old strength. I had to let go. It happened in an instant. A black truck zoomed by in a blur, a matter of feet from my face, heading the dog from the side at blinding speed. Thinking back it must have been going at least 200 kilometres an hour, maybe more. It skidded and lurched as it tried to regain its direction after going over the furry speedbump, then without slowing, sped off. 

To this day it was one of the disturbing scenes I've witnessed with my own two eyes. Buster may as well have been cut in half. He lay there, killed on impact, with tire tread running directly through his stomach, separating him head from tail. 

Immediately the tears came flooding in. I ran the whole way home, without stopping for air. When I got home I sat on the first stair of the staircase, facing the front door until my parents got home. It must've been hours. I didn't stop crying the whole time. 

I don't remember much about the conversation with my parents. My mother was in shock, and comforted me while I cried into her shoulder. My father on the other hand was very upset, and after maybe fifteen minutes of pacing and grumbling, went out to go find the dog's remains.

 I told him exactly where the dog was and he set off. He came back maybe an hour later, angrier than he was before. “There's nothing there!” he yelled. “What?” I asked, not knowing what he meant. “There's nothing there, not even a trace!” he proclaimed. 

He went on to say that there was no dead dog, the road was clean and dry, and he searched around the area and found nothing. He assumed I had lost the dog, and made up a story about how it had died, in order to cover my tracks. 

I pleaded with my parents that it did happen, but they didn't listen. I was sent to my room. I stared out the window for hours, feeling sorry for myself. Eventually I noticed something strange, coming from the woods. A pillar of black smoke, as if from a chimney, was rising into the sky. It was coming right from where the hole was. I moved to show it to my parents but decided against it because they were so angry with me. 

Eventually sleep washed over me, and I drifted off into my dreams. 

Now comes the strangest part of the story, and the part that to this day, I still can't make any sense of. The next day around noon, I was playing in the front yard with my brother, when our dog came running up to us and began jumping on my brother and happily licking him. 

I was in shock. At first I was scared. I had seen him die, quite brutally at that. I ran inside to get my parents, and they were so happy. To them i had just lost the dog, so it made perfect sense that he had wandered back. 

Weeks went by, and after arguing my case so long I decided I had just imagined him dying. What else could I do? The dog wasn't the same after that though. It's hard to explain but he would often zone out, staring at the wall for hours on end. 

It seemed like he didn't even blink. He used to do anything for food, and now he hardly ate. Strangest of all though, ever since the incident, he howled and cried all night long, every night. Eventually my parents resorted to making him sleep outside. 

I still don't know what to make of this happening. But I felt like I had to tell my story in case anybody has ever seen something similar. 

I'm sixteen now. I still live in the same house. The thing that really made me want to write this story though, is for the first time since that incident, I saw smoke coming from the hole in the woods last night. 

I don't know what it means, but there is something so unsettling about it. Let me know if anybody knows anything about this.
