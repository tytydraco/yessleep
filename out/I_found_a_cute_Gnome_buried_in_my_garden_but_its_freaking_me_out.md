Day 1:  
I've never been one to believe in the supernatural or even indulge in horror stories, but what I'm experiencing is making me question everything. It started with a garden gnome I found buried in the backyard of the new house I moved into. It's just a regular, ceramic gnome â€“ or so I thought. I placed it near the roses, thinking it'd add a quirky touch to the garden.  
Day 3:  
Something weird is happening. I could swear the gnome wasn't in the same position I left it. I thought maybe an animal moved it, but how could any animal move something so heavy? It's probably just me being forgetful.  
Day 7:  
I'm not being forgetful. The gnome is moving, I'm sure of it now. Every morning when I wake up, it's in a different spot. It's always a subtle change, but it's enough to notice. I tried to brush it off, telling myself there's a logical explanation. Maybe someone is playing a prank on me?  
Day 10:  
No one's playing a prank. I decided to test my theory and marked the gnome's position with a piece of chalk. The next morning, it had moved, well beyond the chalk line. I'm starting to feel uneasy. The look on the gnome's face seems... different, almost menacing.  
Day 14:  
I can't sleep. Every little sound at night makes me jump. I feel like the gnome is watching me, even though I know it sounds crazy. It's just a ceramic figure, right? But why does it feel like its eyes follow me around?  
Day 17:  
I tried to get rid of it. I threw it in the trash, but the next morning, there it was, back in the garden, covered in dirt as if it had dug itself out. I'm genuinely scared now. This isn't normal. I don't know what to do. It's just a gnome, but... why do I feel like it's something much more sinister?  
Day 20:  
Things are getting worse. Last night, I heard noises outside my window, like the scraping of ceramic on concrete. I was too frightened to look. When I mustered the courage to check in the morning, the gnome was right there, outside my bedroom window, staring in.  
Day 23:  
I can't keep this to myself anymore. I tried to tell a friend about what's happening, but they laughed it off. They don't understand. I feel like I'm trapped in a nightmare. The gnome is not just a garden decoration. There's something evil about it. I can feel it.  
Day 25:  
Last night was the worst. I heard the scraping again, but this time it was louder, closer. I dared to peek through the blinds, and I wish I hadn't. The gnome was there, but it wasn't still. I saw it move, its tiny ceramic feet shuffling towards my door. I locked everything and pushed a dresser against my bedroom door.  
Day 27:  
I'm writing this because I don't know what will happen to me. The gnome is outside my door. I can hear it scraping against the wood. I don't understand how this is possible. It's just a garden gnome, but it's terrorizing me. I'm so scared. I don't know what it wants, but I can feel its malice.  
If you're reading this, please believe me. It's not just a story. Something is very wrong with that gnome. I don't know if I'll make it through the night, but I had to warn others. Be careful of the things you find in your garden. They might not be as innocent as they seem.
