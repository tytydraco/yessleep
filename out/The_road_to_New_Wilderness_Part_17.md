I gripped Chris’s hand and snuck a peek through the ship’s rail, watching the reflection of the beast.

Water fell in rivulets from the monster’s head, and it rose to be eye-level with the ship, the hull at its jawline, nose pointed in the same direction as the ship’s prow. I’d never seen an animal this big in person, and the monster’s eyes reflected in the water were the size of basket balls. Thick scales lay fitted close together on its skin like a crocodile’s but its’s head reminded me more of something older, something larger, a time when reptiles ruled the earth, and man was little more than a minor inconvenience. Its teeth could have been carved from telephone poles for their diameter, and waves lapped at the submerged lower row to tug loose a few shreds of tangled seaweed.

Both eyes facing the ship blinked, the one to the rear of the head larger than the one in front, circled with irises of deep crimson. Even seeing their reflection in the water made my head swim, and something wriggled in the back of my mind.

Whispers.

They roiled in my consciousness, whined like electric engines, and my ears popped as if I was in an airplane high in the sky.

From the depths of my brain, floating to the surface of unknown memory, came three broken words, hoarse and impersonal.

*‘Why . . . you . . . here?’*

My eyes widened, and I couldn’t tear them away from the reflection on the water, as Dr. O’Brian’s voice echoed in my fuzzy memory.

*A psy-organic, one of the rarest and most dangerous anomalies that exists.*

“We mean you no harm.” Captain Grapeshot’s voice made me jump for how it broke the silence, and I glimpsed him sweeping the broad hat from his head in a polite bow, as if in the presence of royalty. “We are mere travelers passing through, oh mighty one. Leave us to live another day, and we will honor these waters as yours, for all time.”

Silence.

Sails creaked, the ship still moving, the enormous predator keeping pace with us by simple lazy swipes of its long tail. A hush fell over the whispers, and I didn’t breathe, my pulse frozen in fear.

One of the crimson irises swiveled down, and its reflection in the water met my eye.

Ice, so cold it seemed to burn, shot through every vein in my body. I couldn’t move, couldn’t so much as whimper in fear, the being latched on to me through our gazes, peering into my very soul. Voices slithered through my mind like soft tendrils, too low for me to hear, but something about them seemed . . . curious, almost like the thing in the water was just as perplexed by my existence as I was to its.

With every ounce of willpower I had left, I forced my dry eyelids shut, and bit my lip at the pain that coursed through my skull in a bolt of lightning.

*‘Go.’*

A split second after the whispers echoed in my mind, a rumble crept from the huge creature’s throat, thunderous and baritone, shaking every board in the ship. With a great plunge, the creature dove, and the enormous, scaly tail rose arched into the sky behind it.

*Splash.*

The tail rocketed down after its owner, and sent a geyser of water into the air, higher than the tallest mast of the ship. It rained down on all of us in a heavy curtain and knocked me onto my stomach with the force of the impact. As if trembling itself, the ship wobbled back and forth on its keel, but stayed upright, and the pain in my head began to dissipate.

“All hands, count off!” First to stand, Captain Grapeshot checked little Tarren over with meticulous care, his eyes probing the rest of the ship for missing crew members.

“I’m alright.”

“Still here, cap!”

“Good to go, captain.”

Happy shouts echoed from around the deck, and the color returned to the pirates’ faces. Crystalline rivers drained out the sides of the railings to leave behind chunks of soggy grass, fresh-grown seaweed, and a few silvery fish that flopped along the boards in surprise at their predicament. Some of the nearby seagulls started to caw once more, and just like that, the lake went back to its tranquil self beneath the late summer sun.

Jamie helped Chris to his feet, and I went to do the same.

*Whoa.*

My head fizzed with static, the earlier pain still in the process of ebbing away, and I stumbled.

“Hey, easy.” Jamie caught my arm, her green eyes locked onto me with concern. “You don’t look so good.”

Shaking my head, I winced at another jolt of slowly fading ache in my brain. “I’m fine.”

Another hand seized my arm, and the first mate stared into my eyes with a deadly serious frown.

His dark gaze flared with shock, and the first mate’s jaw went slack. “You looked at it.”

*Oh no.*

“I-I . . .” My throat closed up, exhaustion from the day’s work and a sudden realization of what I had done enough to strip me of any useful words. Chris and Jamie stood only feet away, but they may as well have been miles off for how helpless we all were. I’d broken some cardinal rule, done something unforgivable, and the first mate knew. I couldn’t lie, I sucked at lying, and with how dizzy I felt, there was no way I could conjure up a successful excuse.

“Captain!” He spun on his heel so fast that he became a blur, and the first mate hauled me by the arm over the deck, his grip iron-clad on my wrist. “A word?”

Chris tried to hobble to my aid, but a nearby crewman blocked him with a drawn sword, all eyes converging on me as I was dragged over the wet planks of the ship.

Halfway up the steps to the helm, Captain Roberts turned, and his eyes narrowed into suspicious slits upon catching sight of me. “What’s the meaning of this?”

My heart hammered against my abused ribs, and I swallowed at the alarmed glares from the rest of the pirates. Now I’d done it. How badly would they beat me this time? Would they do worse? What would happen to Jamie and Chris?

With me still in tow, the first mate pointed to the doors of the great cabin underneath the quarterdeck. “We need to talk. Now.”

His curt words were enough to bring the entire deck back into abyssal silence, many of the nearby pirates taking cautionary steps away from me, as though I had some kind of disease. Even Boatswain Emelia lowered her gaze from the captain’s, and my guts threatened to overpower me with nausea at the sight of it.

Jamie and Chris looked on with horror from the forecastle as I was shoved into the dark interior of the great cabin.

It was dark, and cramped, with a small table to one side covered in maps and old-fashioned navigational equipment. Empty wine bottles littered the floor, rolling back and forth with the rocking of the ship, and the air smelled of stale alcohol. A lone rapier hung from the wall, beautiful and gleaming, with unlit lanterns on hooks around the room. Two iron hoops in the right-side wall supported a simple canvas hammock that swung from side to side, and next to it, a little shelf held various odds and ends, including three books. I was surprised to see the *Holy Bible*, though not so much that it was rather dusty, and an old edition of *Treasure Island*, held a similar layer of gray fluff over its cover. Oddly enough, the third book, a well-worn copy of *Pride and Prejudice* shone like a star, as if someone read from it every single day without fail. In any other circumstance, I might have found it strange for such an old book about Victorian era love to be popular with a crew of child-pirates, but I had little time to dwell on the fact.

Captain Roberts slammed and locked the door, while the first mate pulled a wooden chair from the table and set it in the center of the room.

“Sit.” He jabbed a finger at it, and his no-nonsense tone made my heart sink. This stranger had been the only one to be kind to us, and now . . . now I was locked in a room with two irate pirates, with not so much as a knitting needle to defend myself with.

I slid into the cold oak chair and watched the first mate dart around the room lighting lanterns. What did they plan to do that they needed such good lighting? Did I dare think about it? Surely they wouldn’t kill me, not now?

Captain Roberts stalked to where I sat and leaned down to hiss into my face with a vicious snarl. “What did ya do, you poxy curr?”

*Do I even bother to answer? Will he be more angry, or less?*

I eyed his sword, and tried to suppress all the horrific scenarios my panicking mind conjured up as to what they might do. “I, uh . . .”

“She looked right at it, Sam.” Finished with the last of the lanterns, the first mate rounded on the captain and I with a strange look on his face, one that bordered on hopeful, excited even. “I swear, she met the Leviathan’s eye.”

His snarl melted into a confused frown, though I couldn’t tell if it was from the name, or the first mate’s words, and Captain Roberts took a step back from me. “That’s not possible.”

“She did!” The first mate stabbed the air in my direction, wearing a giddy smile I’d never seen before. “Which means I was right. There are people who are resistant to the mind-whispers, and that means—”

“Oh, for the love of . . .” Captain Roberts threw his hands into the air, exasperated, and it seemed he’d already forgotten that I sat mere feet away from their conversation. “Not this again, Peter. Five times we tried, and five times good men never came back from that abyss. It’s hopeless.”

Peter’s shoulders deflated at that, but he stepped closer to the captain, holding up a hand to signal for patience. “So, we send her in. After all, if she doesn’t come back, what have we lost?”

*Send me in where?*

I tried not to show my shock at the way they talked about me, glued to my chair in unease. This situation kept going from bad to worse, and while I was glad they weren’t torturing me, I had a feeling that Peter’s plan wasn’t one to my benefit.

Scowling, Captain Roberts crossed his arms in disapproval. “She’ll bring a pretty penny from the soldiers, more alive than dead. The crew needs a rest, we need more ammunition, provisions, and tar to careen the ship. Besides, it’s a full day’s sail southward, and we already had a near brush with the Leviathan.”

Something rippled on Peter’s slender face, like the careful emotionless mask started to slip, and his skin tinged a frustrated red. “So that’s it then? We just go on like this, selling bodies to the graybacks until we’re the only ones left?”

“*We* are all *we* need.” Captain Roberts growled back, his hand gripping the hilt of his sword so tight I wondered if his knuckles might split. “*They* deserve this, *they* started this, *they*—”

“They’re people for God’s sake!” Peter erupted and kicked one of the empty wine bottles so that it smashed against the nearby wall into a thousand red shards. “I’m sick of the lying, Sam, sick of the blood, the death, all of it. I don’t want to do this anymore.”

His own rage boiled to the top, and Captain Roberts closed on Peter to stare right into his eyes, a vein bulging in his neck. “Even the old man? After everything he did, everything he took from us? Was that wrinkly scumbag a person too?”

“He got what he deserved.” Peter stood his ground, the two almost eyeball-to-eyeball, hands on their weapons, though neither drew on the other. “But the women? The kids? Can you look me in the eye and tell me you sleep better at night after what we did? What would Grace think?”

*Grace.*

The name hit me like a bucket of ice water, and I remembered how Tarren had turned so sad at the mention of this mystery girl. So, she had been important to more than just the child. She’d been someone special . . . someone close.

Like family.

Something glinted in the corner of Captain Robert’s left eye, a brief gleam in the yellow light of the surrounding lanterns, but he blinked hard, and it vanished. “Get out.”

Peter’s eyes flicked toward me, and concern crawled over his features. “Sam, don’t take this out on—”

“*Captain*.” He snapped the words, emotion heavy in his voice, and Captain Roberts stomped to his desk, his back to the both of us. “It’s Captain Grapeshot Roberts. Now *get out*.”

For a moment, Peter’s expression crumpled, and he looked genuinely crushed, as if the words hurt more than I knew. But he just sighed, and turned to me, his eyes grave. “If anything happens, I’ll be close by.”

*Wait, so you are on my side?*

I didn’t have time to so much as stutter a thank you before the first mate stormed out the great cabin doors and slammed them shut behind him.

Deafening quiet fell over the tiny room, and I gulped a nervous lump in my throat, gauging the distance between me, and the rapier on the wall. Should I take the chance, and try to escape? Where would I go? I didn’t know how to use a sword, and even if he was a few years younger than me, the captain definitely had the size and strength advantage. I’d end up hurt, or worse, and God only knew what they might do to Chris and Jamie in retaliation.

Cloaked in shadow, the captain kept his back to me, his head hung low over the table full of maps. “Is it true?”

His voice lost some of the strong English-Caribbean accent, and Captain Roberts let his shoulders slump, as if he couldn’t hold them up anymore. It made him look less like a fearsome pirate captain and more like a boy in mismatched clothing with a sword, two boots, and the weight of the world pressing down. If it hadn’t been for the heinous things Peter had mentioned, I might have felt sorry for him.

*Chris and Jamie. I have to think of a way to help them.*

“It is.” I dug my thumbnail into the side of my trousers to keep from shaking.

Captain Roberts walked to the bay windows in the back of the cabin, and I noticed him rubbing at the shark’s tooth necklace he wore close to his chest, as if it were some kind of good luck charm. “Of all the things that live in these waters, the Leviathan is king. It’s a smart beast, it knows when a motor goes out on the water, and it knows enough to understand human words. There’s six of them, by my count, but I figure they’ve got babies on the way like everything else around here. Every time someone has dared to look one in the eye, the monster whispers into their minds, and they’re dead within minutes. Everyone . . . except you.”

At last he turned from the window, both eyes regarding me with skeptical weariness. “We have a deal, the soldiers and I. Whenever I catch someone on the water, I bring them in, and the graybacks pay me whatever I need. Guns, food, medicine, a ransom fit for a king, as long as I collect enough bodies. They’ll pay double for rangers, and who knows how much for one who can survive a mind-whisperer . . . but they would pay a lot more for this.”

In one hand, the captain held out a piece of white modern printer paper, crisscrossed with folds and creases. It depicted a simple black box, much like a small plastic travel tote, with a folding handle and four thick hasps to hold it shut. The box looked military in issue and bore a set of white numbers painted on the side of the case; LDB01106.

Confused, but with the slightest glimmer of hope that I might not get an extra beating today, I straightened up in my seat. “So . . . what is it?”

“I don’t know.” He flipped the paper to look at the image, the Captain’s eyes searching the printout as if there were some hidden clue he’d missed somewhere. “But the graybacks are willing to pay through the nose for it. Trouble is, with the Leviathan in the sea, and most of their aircraft not working this far into the county, the soldiers need us to get it back . . . and last time they saw this bloody thing, it was in Collingswood.”

My spirits tumbled, that name enough to dash my hopes to pieces. Collingswood. The town burned by a horde of missiles, all because of one stupid mistake. Over 5,000 souls lost in a single night.

Taking a deep breath, I cleared my throat, desperate to find a positive side to this conversation. “But can’t ELSAR reach it by land? I mean, if it’s that important, they should have the men to get it themselves.”

Waving me off, the captain crossed the room to a small cupboard, and pulled out a tall wine bottle, along with a corkscrew. “You think they’d hire us if they did? Oh, they’ve got pretty guns and lots of armor, true, but the boys in gray are stretched thinner than you know. Besides, the water has cut off most of the town from the south, and a bunch of the white-eyed devils made a nest on the eastern side, over a hundred strong. Whatever they dropped in there tainted the air with some kind of chemical, so none of our lads can go ten feet without a mask. Only way in is from the sea, and we’re the only ones who know these waters well enough to get there.”

*Collingswood is at the end of the ridgeline. If they send us out to look, we could just cut north, and swing around to head for New Wilderness. They can’t follow us far on land, so if we can get a head start on the guards . . .*

“So,” I tried not to show my anxiety at such thoughts and focused on gouging the tiny hole in my khakis a little wider at the hip. “We just have to go find this box?”

“No, lass.” He strode over to me, dropped the paper in my lap, and the captain yanked the cork from his wine bottle. “*You* do. Peter is getting soft, but he always was the better man of us two, and he just might be right. Sooner or later, there won’t be anyone left on the water but us, and we need more supplies to build a fort before winter. We’ve tried five times to retrieve the box, and every time that cursed town swallows whoever we send. There’s something wrong with it, something worse than mutants at its core. But if you bring it back, we could ask for a high enough price to retire from pirating for good. No more fighting, no more death . . . a fresh start.”

My brow furrowed, and it dawned on me what he meant. “What’s in it for me?”

Raising the bottle in a mock toast, Captain Roberts regained some of his former malice in the smirk that crawled over his shrewd face. “Freedom. You bring me that box, and I’ll let you go.”

“All three of us?” Asking for more made my heart pound, but I couldn’t risk losing Jamie or Chris if this deal turned out to be legitimate.

“Aye.” He drained a long gulp of the alcohol, and some of the blood red liquid dribbled out of the corners of his mouth. I wondered how much he drank, and if the dozens of empty bottles were anything to go by, this wouldn’t be the last bottle he had today. “But you go alone. The other two stay, to make sure you come back.”

The weave on my pantleg gave way, and the thumbnail I’d been picking it with poked through to my skin in a burst of light pain. “And our gear? We’ll get it back?”

“Every piece of it.” He wiped his mouth, and held the bottle out to me, in anticipation of my answer.

Thoughts whirled in my head, and I debated what to do. I couldn’t exactly say no, considering that the alternative was to be sold to ELSAR as a prisoner of war, but taking this deal meant going into Collingswood alone. I’d never done anything outside the walls of New Wilderness by myself. I still barely knew half of the mutated animals that could be out there. Without Jamie’s sixth sense, or Chris’s experience, how could I hope to get more than ten yards?

The memory of the boatswain kicking Chris for protecting me floated up in my mind, and I forced myself to focus on that.

*Matt and Carla left me behind. I won’t do the same to Chris and Jamie. Not a chance.*

I took the bottle, poured some of the sour, vinegary stuff into my mouth, and choked the wine down in a fit of coughs. “Deal.”
