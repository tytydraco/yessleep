Employee File: N.H. — Personal Logs (Confidential)
Entry #1
January 4th
8:22 PM

I’ve never liked first impressions. People make them into little resumes, smiling through their teeth, pretending to be human for thirty seconds while their insides rot quietly. But mine? Mine are quiet. I don’t oversell. I watch. I collect.

This is Day Three at the new office.
A fresh start, they said.
New state, new company, new systems.
New chances not to fuck it up again.

The building itself is forgettable—four stories of glass pretending to be modern, sitting like a plastic tooth in the middle of a dull business park off I-90. Everything smells like stale HVAC air and hand sanitizer. I memorized the layout the first day, because that’s what you do when you’re trying not to be noticed. You become part of the floor plan. You fade in.

Pod C is where I’ve been assigned. An open-concept block of six desks shaped like a malformed hexagon, surrounded by half-hearted privacy screens that don’t actually provide privacy. I sit across from Cynthia (HR assistant, forty-three, chews on pen caps) and to the left of Marcus (IT, mild halitosis, never breaks eye contact with his monitor). Neither of them talks to me, which is a relief.

But today, he arrived.

Ryan.

He walked in at 9:07 a.m., holding a travel mug with some indie brand logo I didn’t recognize—probably a Portland coffee roaster, ironically. He was escorted by Damien from Talent, who was doing his over-friendly “this is your new work family” routine. Ryan laughed at something Damien said. That laugh—God. It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t fake. It bubbled up like warm soda in the back of his throat. He’s got that kind of voice that’s just naturally soft, like it apologizes for being spoken aloud.

I felt it. Like a hum behind my ribs.

He’s twenty-four—I caught that when Damien mentioned “fresh out of UW.” University of Washington. I pictured him in college dorms, walking across wet sidewalks, earbuds in, probably listening to obscure alt-rock or film scores or something weird and pretty. I could almost smell his detergent. Something with cedar. Maybe amber. He looks like he smells clean.

He’s tall—at least six-one. Skinny in a way that doesn’t look weak. His clothes hang off him like he doesn’t care what he wears, but he still manages to look…put together. Button-up shirt with sleeves rolled to the elbow, black pants that hugged just enough to show the curve of his thighs when he sat.

His hair is ridiculous. A riot of curls, not too long, not too short. Dirty blond, with these hints of gold that only show up when the office fluorescents hit just right. He kept running his hand through it when he was talking to Damien, like he was nervous or embarrassed. Or maybe it’s a tic. Maybe he doesn’t like being watched.

He’ll get used to it.

At 10:16, he was shown to his desk—three seats down from mine. I didn’t look up right away. That would be too eager. I timed it. Waited exactly one minute, then looked over like I just happened to notice him. He caught my eye. Smiled.

That smile—

It wasn’t flirtatious. That would’ve been too easy. It was genuine. The kind of smile people don’t give unless they think you’re safe. Harmless. He doesn’t know what I’ve done. He doesn’t know that I moved across the country because I couldn’t stop myself. He doesn’t know about Portland.

He just saw a woman—slightly older, quiet, sitting with perfect posture and polite eyes. That’s all. That’s what he thinks I am.

But I saw him. I saw every twitch of his fingers, every blink, every little glance he didn’t think mattered.

I watched the way he typed. His fingers flutter like he’s trying to chase the words. He hits the spacebar with his left thumb only. His posture slouches after lunch. At 2:41, he yawned and covered it with the back of his hand. Manners. Raised right, probably. Or at least raised to pretend.

I saw the shape of his neck when he stretched, that little hollow beneath the jaw. I imagined pressing my lips there, feeling his pulse. I wonder what it sounds like. I bet it’s slow. Gentle. Like his voice.

We spoke once today. Briefly. The printer jammed—again—and he cursed under his breath, soft and embarrassed. I stood up, calm, collected. I walked over and said, “Yeah, it jams if you send more than two pages at once. You’ve got to feed it like a baby.”

He laughed.

And then he looked at me.

Not through me. At me. Not in the way men usually do. There was no inventory in his gaze. Just…connection. Eye contact, straight and steady. Brown eyes, flecked with amber. He smelled like detergent and skin.

I felt something shift in me. Something warm and sharp and old.

And I wanted to scream.

Because I know where this leads.

I promised myself it wouldn’t happen again. That I’d keep to myself. Be normal. Blend in. But then he walked in, all soft smiles and dumb jokes, and I felt it crack under my skin—the hunger. The pull. The need.

It’s not about sex. Not really. It’s about understanding. About peeling someone open and seeing what makes them human. I want to know him. I want to learn the patterns of his speech, memorize the cadence of his steps, catalog every detail until I can wear his existence like a second skin.

He has a little mole under his left eye. It shifts when he talks. I watched it all day.

No one here knows who I was. They don’t know about the “incident.” They don’t know about the review board, the restraining order, the therapist who said I had “boundary issues.”

They just see Nina H.—new hire, data analyst, quiet, punctual, well-dressed.

And that’s good. Because it means I can start over.
This time, I’ll be smarter.
This time, I’ll be subtle.
This time, he won’t even realize how much he needs me—until it’s too late.

There’s nothing wrong with looking.
There’s nothing wrong with admiring.
There’s nothing wrong with writing it down.

This is my private space. My documentation.
Just thoughts. Just feelings.
Just…notes.

Nothing more.

Not yet.
