I awake to the steady thrum of a cart in motion; to the muted lights and neutral scent of the train. For what reason, I can't divine, but it feels as if I’ve slept for centuries. Goosebumps dot my flesh from the low temperature; My eyes are heavy like a judge’s gavel and my muscles ache as I stretch and groan quietly. My booth, though it has four seats, only houses one other. A slightly muscular, darkly bespectacled sort of man whose aged features are framed by salt and pepper hair. His gaze is locked on something in the inky void beyond the window, glazed over yet hyper focused. I hesitate, feeling as if I'm interrupting something important, but my concern for punctuality squashes the tiny voice in my head.

“Um, excuse me, David? Do you know how far we are from Never?”

He blinks, and his icy blue eyes bore into me as his head swivels to meet my gaze. His voice is soft, the inflection contradictory to his cold look. Something about his left eye looks strange, but I can't put my finger on it.

“Next stop, son.”

I flash a tentative smile, and let out a sigh of relief. There's a beat, the absence of conversational substance between one moment and the next, and though he's a stranger, curiosity grasps my voice before I can.

“Why are you going there?”

He looks at me more softly, a smile I can tell is reserved for someone who is not me graces his face, a smile I can almost tell missed being there.

“My wife. I haven't seen her in years. What about you?”

I nod, and clear my throat, to buy a moments respite. The answer is crystal clear, it's all around me, in the thrum of the engine and the pale glow of the overhead lights; it still takes me a moment to remember.

“Birds of a feather, huh? I'm going to see my boyfriend.”

He gives a chuckle, a warm and hearty thing.

“Young love, eh? How long have you and Alex been together?”

I hesitate again, the time eluding me for some reason; a pervasive doubt that I can't define trapping my words in my throat

“Th- ha, four, sorry. Four years. Had our anniversary last week, fancy dinner and all that.”

He grins and reaches to pat me on the shoulder, almost proudly.

“Me and my bird are coming up on twelve. The years really fly, don't they?”

I nod politely, and we share a moment of silence. It isn't empty; filled with a comfortable sort of understanding, of thoughtfulness about those who wait for us at the end of this journey. It's nice. My thoughts drift to him, verdant eyes and rosy cheeks; wry smile as he looks down upon me from his superior stature, teasing yet loving remark ready to fire off at a moment's notice. Warmth flows through me, though it only serves to draw my attention to how cold I am. The thought makes me uncomfortable, and after half an hour of discomfort, I try to crush the nagging sensation that I'm missing something by forcing the conversation forward, pulling on the only thing I know of the man before me and drawing his attention back to me.

“What's Lily like?”

He smiles wryly, like a philosopher who's seen the answer to all queries in the curve of her smile. He takes a moment to consider, and I grant it to him freely. Words can never truly capture the ineffable quality of love. He tries, nonetheless, because however ineffable it may be, he wants to grasp it.

“Bad call, mate. I'm gonna go off on one now, ha! She's.. I suppose she's everything. My first love, the sweetest gift god ever put on this earth. The type of girl that'll try to make you laugh in hell, the type whose beauty'd make you weep in heaven. No one else compared after. I've missed her; I'm sure you understand-”

I nod in commiseration, my soul resonating with the longing I can hear ring through his voice.

“It was hard to be apart on our thirteenth anniversary. You ever had anything like that?”

I pause, looking at him in confusion, and though for some reason the answer makes my skin crawl, I respond in kind.

“Yeah.. our fourth actually. He wasn't there for it, busy with others. Life got in the way, you know?”

My confusion is shared; as the man raises an eyebrow, smile dropping like a judge's gavel and eyes narrowing. I can feel the tension building between us, that joint sense of unease and as our voices no longer echo back and forth, I recognise something so strange that I have to look around us, doubting my ears. Utter silence.

There's no one else in this cart. Just us two. His voice is slow, a hint of faux amusement in it like someone asking a friend to explain a poor joke.

“Mate, didn't you say you had your anniversary dinner last week?”

An unusual kind of venom claws at my thoughts, a solution composed of indignation and insecurity that compels me to defend myself by striking back.

“How did you celebrate your 13th anniversary if you've only been together 12 years?”

We sit in strained silence, staring at eachother in the most irrational anger I've ever experienced, and I know he feels the same sickness that I do; an insidious strain of confusion that twists my stomach up into knots. How did he know Alex's name?

“I'm not lying.”

He quips back without missing a beat, voice tense.

“Neither am I.”

But I can see the deceit in his eyes as much as I can feel it drenching my words. Confusion dances around my thoughts between vitriol and denial, twirling between them and springing between my clenched teeth to deliver one, simple yet so very dangerous question; the one I know we've both been thinking, the one that I fear will shatter the ice and send us plunging into the inky depths beyond the train cart.

“Why hasn't the train stopped?”

His expression breaks from anger into surprise, tinged with confusion.

“What?”

I continue, swallowing the lump in my throat, my voice shaking.

“Thirty minutes, maybe more, we've been here. You said it was the next stop.”

He freezes, eyes looking to the indistinguishable, inky landscape beyond the window.

“I must've been off. Sorry.”

I don't accept it; his answer or his apology, and I pry, like an explorer plunging his hand into a hornets nest 

“How many stops does this train have?”

He doesn't respond, face scrunching up in contemplation. My voice drops alongside my face.

“Has it ever?

The silence is more deafening than ever; the absence of sound, of presence and existence beyond us and the abyss beyond the window is as suffocating as it is maddening. He looks at me, and I can see fear in his eyes.

“Then why are we on it? Why is there a train with only one stop?”

My answer is as empty as the absence of everything outside the window, tone hollow, and I can't help but feel a crawling hint of deja vu.

“I don't know.”

But I think I do; my mind connects the dots, hell, I think we both did a while ago. Subtlety has never been for me, Alex used to say that, so I crash through the denial and dread with a sledgehammer of an inquiry, one I can feel might shatter me alongside it.

“Why did we both lie?”

David looks at me, the remnants of his rage simmering into embers that are snuffed into sparks before my eyes, as for the first time, we’re honest with one another.

“Because neither of us like the truth.”

I look at him, and I can finally give him an answer rather than another question. It comes out with a wet laugh, punctuated by my eyes growing wet with misery; the truth is an agonising tragedy, yet it sounds so simple.

“That's why the train never stops.”

His gaze returns to the window, eyes slick, mouth straining into a melancholy smile. He wipes the blood from his shirt, the remnants of the shot I can now see beneath his glasses, the bullet that pierced his left eye.

“I miss her every damn day; it should have been me.”

It's almost muscle memory to retort, like I've done it a hundred times.

“Lily wouldn't have wanted that.”

David is silent. I shiver, that same freezing chill enveloping my body, and I finally notice, looking down without denial, that my skin is deathly blue, my clothes drenched in the waters of the lake our love was first kindled.

“I wish he never left me.”

He looks at me, a sad, strange little smile on his face.

“You're a good kid.”

I sigh, my breath rattling and voice shaky.

“I wasn't good enough for him.”

We sit there as twin failures, for but a moment, before David rests a bloodied hand on my freezing skin.

“Until we listen to eachother, until we're ready to face the truth, I think Never’ll always be the next stop.”

I sob openly, my voice weak and my body shivering.

“I'm not ready to move on from him! I- I loved him! Why..”

I sniffle meekly.

“..why wasn't that enough?”

David squeezes my hand comfortingly, it's enough to help ground me, to stop the spiral, the misery and the longing. He exhales slowly, voice soft as velvet 

“I don't know if we'll ever get off this train, Adam, but I feel like we're getting closer.”

I can't help but ask, panickedly as I feel exhaustion start to overtake me; as my eyelids grow heavy like a gavel once.

“And if we're stuck here forever? If we can't accept what happened?”

David wipes a half-frozen tear from my face, and stares into me with an icy eye and a gaping wound. His voice is the last thing I hear as I slip into unconsciousness once more, as I fall into a cycle I know must've happened a dozen times or more at this point. The darkness envelops me as his words rattle around my skull.

“If Forever is what it takes to move on; it's better than Never.”
