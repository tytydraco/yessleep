“It’s just—it’s creepy. I don’t like it.” James said, still carefully scanning the photo despite his statements.

I sat in silence. I thought the photo was creepy as well, but not to the extent that James did. I just wasn’t so sure what it was about the photo that scared him as badly as it did.

“I think it’s interesting.” I said, curling my finger. He caught the motion and handed the photo back to me.

“You would, wouldn’t you, Tony?” He gave me a light push. “How’d you even get this thing, anyways?”

I perked up. I knew how I’d received it and how it came into my possession, but I didn’t actually know how the photo came to be. I didn’t know anyone who was a photographer and I certainly didn’t know anyone capable of naturally capturing a photo such as the one I’d received earlier.

“Uh.” I said. “Well, I went to check my mail, like I usually do. I open it up and it’s just there. No other mail either. I mean, makes sense considering it’s Sunday, but still.”

“So, it just appeared in your mailbox?” James asked. “Bullshit.”

“You already saw it yourself.” I said. “It’s just the photo, nothing more. That—and there’s no return address.” The statement sent a small chill throughout my body. I’d known from the moment I examined it a little more closely that it had to have been placed directly in my mailbox, but it still unnerved me to know that whoever had given me this photograph knew where I lived.

“Ah, yeah.” He said. “I mean, who do you think could have put it in there?” He was tapping his foot rapidly on the floor now. I could feel the slight vibrations of it in the couch.

“Well, I don’t know anyone who could have taken it. I mean, Ben’s pretty good at taking pictures, but he just does it for fun. And I couldn’t begin to tell you how—well—this.” I pointed at the figure in the photograph. James took it back and looked at it again.

“Yeah.” He said. “I just can’t—it’s so freaky.” I didn’t know if he’d meant to do it, but James put the photograph in his jacket pocket. Must have done it unconsciously.

“Uh—hey.” I tried to say. James cut me off.

“I mean—who takes a photograph like that?” He said. “It’s weird. You think you’ll be alright? You’re a little more used to looking at this stuff than I am.” I opted to give up on notifying him. He’d find out that he had the photo when he emptied his pockets. And then he’d surely give it back to me.

“Well, I won’t dwell on it for too much longer.” I said. “I mean, if they put it in my mailbox, they probably know me personally, yeah? I’ll just throw the photo away and go on with my life. Not a big deal.”

James’ face shifted from slightly creeped out to his default neutral look. “Yeah, okay. I think that’s a good way to go about it.” He got up from my couch and went over to the entrance hallway of my apartment. “I uh—I think I’m gonna go, that photo’s got me wigged out.”

I got up and walked over to him. “Alright, man.” I said. “Sorry if I really creeped you out with that. It’s just—I thought it was interesting and that you’d like it. With you being into horror and all.”

“Can’t believe I’m saying this.” He said. “But I think—for once—that was too much. Too—not human. I don’t know, it’s fucking weird, man.”

He out his shoes on and went to open the door. I tried to apologize to him again. “Hey man, I really am sorry, just don’t be too mad at me?”

He opened the door and began to walk out. Just before he left, he turned around. “Well, I’m not mad now, but I can’t say I won’t be mad if I get nightmares!”

“Dick.” I said.

“Later.” He left and the door closed, leaving me alone in my apartment with some questions. Mostly, questions regarding the photograph. I didn’t have to worry about looking at it, as the first thing I did when I received it was take a photo of it on my actual phone.

I didn’t do much for the rest of the day. Not enjoyable stuff, anyways. I cleaned the apartment, reorganized some stuff, watched some TV, did laundry and eventually made dinner. After I ate, I sat down at my desk in my room and thought about what I’d do for the rest of the night. That was when I thought of the photograph again.

I thought of how creepy it looked and what it made me feel. I felt the need to examine it a little closer. I pulled out my phone, turned the brightness all the way up and set it down on my desk. I went to my phone gallery and selected the photo.

A shudder ran down my spine. Similarly to the first time I saw the photo, it was jarring and caught me off guard. I’ll do my best to describe what was in the photograph.

The first thing I noted was the lack of light. The photograph was very clearly taken at night, but there was something else. The atmosphere was gloomy, eerie. There wasn’t a star in the sky nor the moon. The only light in the photo, seemingly, was the flash on the camera it was taken with. It looked like the photograph was taken just a few hundred feet away from the entrance of a forest. The trees were dark, but not so much that I couldn’t make out what they were. They were thick, too. Thick trunks, thick leaves. They smothered the space in the forest and made it impossible to see what was inside it.

There was one thing I could see, though, and it was what shook James so badly. On the far left of the photograph, almost impossible to make out, was a man standing just in front of the forest entrance.

Well, calling him a man wouldn’t exactly be the correct way of going about it. He looked like a man, mostly. He wore blue jeans and a green t-shirt, but that was the extent to which he was clothed. His legs and one of his arms were mostly normal sized, albeit a bit lanky. His right arm was too long. Too long for a normal human body. The area near his legs was hard to make out, but his arm drooped down to it and I couldn’t see where it ended.

His chest was normal too, but his head—I could see why it had scared James so badly. The man’s head looked too big for his body. He had hair, but it was wispy and downy, like a newborn’s. His head was the only part that was big, though, everything else was too small. His eyes were tiny. If I had to estimate, I’d say that, in comparison to the rest of his head, they looked like small olives. They were pure white and looked like they were just there. Not bordered in any color, just there. It was uncanny. His nose wasn’t pronounced, if I could even call what he had a nose. It was more like he had nostrils in his face. Two slits way too far down from his eyes. Too far to be normal.

His mouth couldn’t be normal, either. It was similar to his “nose” in that it wasn’t pronounced, but rather a semi-large slit across his face. It was about three and a half inches long. The mouth was parted, and his teeth didn’t look solid. They seemed to be fat, pearly balls in his mouth. White bulbous lumps, swollen and bulging from his gums. His ears were small, too, but those weren’t much to look at.

I had to say, it felt a lot more frightening looking at the photo when the sun had set. It being light out earlier had given me some form of relief. I felt safe in the daylight, but now? Now, I felt vulnerable, like the thing in the photograph was watching me. I closed my blinds and locked my door. I got into my bed and kept the lights on. If it was dark, I might not have been able to get to sleep.

Not that it mattered, because I ended up having a nightmare.

At first, there was darkness. Then, I was able to see. My heart began to thump rapidly when I found out where I was.

I’d found myself in the location where the photo was taken. The complete lack of general light and the eerie atmosphere didn’t help my increasing anxiety. What nearly pushed me over the edge was when I tried to move my legs and found I couldn’t. I panicked and tried to move, but I couldn’t do a thing. That was when I looked up. He wasn’t where he was in the photo originally. He was moving. I could hear as his freakishly long arm dragged along the ground. He reached me, but before he could do anything, the nightmare ended and I woke up.

I was sweaty and breathing heavily. When I realized that what had happened wasn’t real, I fell back into the bed. Relieved, I fell into a slightly less terrifying slumber this time.

That was yesterday.

Today, I woke up to the sounds of someone rapidly banging on my door. I got up and out of bed. I trudged towards the entrance of my apartment. I got to the door, unlocked it and opened it. The first thing I saw was the photograph.

James pushed it into my hands and started to speak frantically. “I—I had a nightmare.”

“Shit.” I said. “So did I.”

“About him?” He said.

“Yeah.” I replied.

“W—what was yours?” He asked.

“I uh—I was in the place the photo was taken, and he tried to do something to me. He didn’t end up doing anything, but it still scared me.” I replied.

“He—he was in my house—in mine. It felt so real. He opened my bedroom door and crawled on top of me. Felt like I was suffocating. I screamed and screamed and pushed him off. When I woke up, he was gone. Just a dream.”

“I—yeah, I—wow.” I said.

“Yeah.” He said. “I’m going home. Going to sleep so I won’t be tired. You need to burn that photo. Now.” Before I could answer, he was gone.

I didn’t do much today. Mostly just rested and prepared to burn that photograph. Haven’t heard from James, probably because he’s resting.

I decided that I’d take the photo and burn it outside. Tonight, it the photograph would be gone and James and I would be released from the nightmare.

I decided that I’d do it after dinner. Just before I went outside, though, I thought of examining the photo one last time. I don’t know why I did it, and I wish I hadn’t, but I did. I sat down at my desk once more. I pulled out the photograph and examined it closely. I very quickly noticed that something was wrong. Something was off. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, though. I took another photo of the physical photograph. I opened up the photo editing app on my phone and layered the two together. I made the first layer visible and made the second invisible. Then, I did the opposite. I looked and looked and looked until I found out what was wrong.

It was on the far left side of the photograph. In the first picture I’d taken, the man was stood in front of the forest, his head still too large for his body.

As I looked at the second photo, my heart sunk.

I turned my phone off and looked at the physical photograph. The man was gone. It looked only like a photo of a creepy forest.

My next move was to try and call James. I picked up my phone and went to his contact in my phone app. I clicked the call button and waited with bated breath.

I only got a message.

“*The person you’re trying to reach is not available. Please try again later.*”

-EDIT-

I burned the photograph. Still haven’t heard from James…
