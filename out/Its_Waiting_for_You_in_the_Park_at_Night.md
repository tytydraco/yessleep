I hope you don't recognize the park. I don't want anyone else to get hurt.

I've been worried about sharing this since it happened Sophomore year. I'm a Senior now, and I'm still as fucked up about it as I was then. Maybe sharing it will help me come to terms with it. Maybe it won't. But you have to promise me that if the park sounds familiar to you, you won't set foot in it ever again. 

  
Not after what happened Sophomore year, when I was young and stupid- on a reckless Friday night.

Zane scaled up the park’s swingset and howled, belt chains glittering under the full moon like tears.

I knew he was doing it to make me smile. I made a big show of rolling my eyes and hoped he wouldn't notice that it worked.

“Shut up,” Lexi shouted, waving the plastic water bottle of my dad’s Vodka at him. “You’re gonna get us caught!”

Lexi said this every time we snuck out, but the park was always empty at night.

I always thought it was because it’s pretty boring. A rickety playset, a tiny pond the town calls a lake, benches.

We used to sit on the swings and pass a bottle around. Sometimes, we'd steal Lexi’s older brother’s cigarettes and pretend we like to smoke.

“D’You ever think other people come here, late at night?” Lexi mused, “Sit where we’re sitting now, breathe our air?”

“My mom says people try to sleep on the benches,” I took a sip and pass it to Zane. When I remember this night, I still feel the cheap vodka burning on my lips. “Like, homeless people.”

Mom always called them *vagrants,* like they're an army of boogeymen. 

*Eat your veggies, kids, or the evil vagrants will GET YOU!*

I never understood why she was so uppity about it. In all our time in this town, I'd never even *seen* any here, just soccer moms and their brats. Cookie-cutter consumers.

Zane took a big gulp of the vodka and chucks the bottlecap. It flew like a little comet and landed on the bench across from us.  “Think they jerk off on those benches?”

Lexi gagged.

I didn't look at them; I just stared at the bottlecap as it spun on its side, faster and faster. It tipped over and-

disappeared?

“Just because *you* like thinking about nasty hobos jacking off doesn’t mean *we* want to!”

I thought I'd just imagined it. I leaned forward in my swing, squinting in the dark. 

The orange glow of the safety-lights seeped between the bench slats, casting prison-bar shadows on the empty ground.

“You sure, Lex?” Zane teased, swigging vodka before loudly dismounting and shoving the bottle into my arms. “What if it was *Gerard Way*? What if he was here *right now*, ready to show you his weiner?”

I watched his Converse blot out the light beneath the bench, and felt my stomach sink. I wish I could go back- I wish I could've said something, anything to stop what happened next.

“First, he wouldn’t call it a ‘weiner’, because he isn’t twelve like *you*,” Lexi grumbled.

Zane splayed on the bench, arms folded like Dracula. 

“Yo Chloe,” He looked at me again, blue eyes beautiful, fishing for a smile for the last time. “Guess who I am. ‘Wh-’”

The word turned into a broken scream. Something unseen pulled Zane through the bench slats *hard.* 

His screaming turned to gurgling. Zane’s head squeezed through, body bursting like a bag of ground beef forced under a narrow doorframe. 

By the time we made it to him, Zane’s arms and legs were impossibly touching. I grasped at his blood-soaked fingers, sobbing, pulling, but it was pointless.

His fingertips squeezed into the gap, bloated like worms.

*Silence.*

Here one minute, then suddenly gone. No trace left but the blood on our hands.

Lexi and I stood over the bench and cried for hours, holding hands with white-knuckles and our best friend's blood drying on our palms.

We didn't bother trying to tell the cops what happened when his parents filed the missing persons' report. Zane loved freaking people out. In a bittersweet, fucked-up way, this was the last bit he ever did. 

I still go back to the park every day, after it gets dark, even after Lexi switched schools. I sit across from the bench, hoping stupidly he'll come back somehow.  

But he never will.

Mom says a "vagrant" killed him, she's sure of it. But deep down, I know that any homeless people this town hates so badly were taken by the same *thing* he was. 

  
And now it sits, under a streetlight. Waiting for a night-time visitor stupid enough to use it. They'll be gone in an instant, and no one will ever notice. After all, the park is always empty at night.
