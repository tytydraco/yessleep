Hey. Sorry it took me a little while to post again. Between the funeral planning, calls with family, and sorting through this house, I just didn’t have the headspace to sit down and write. But the thing on the TV hasn’t stopped, and honestly, the longer I wait to put it into words, the worse it feels. Like if I let it stay unspoken, it’ll just sink deeper into me.

I found an old VCR in the back of the hall closet, covered in dust and still tangled in a yellowing extension cord. Took me half the evening to figure out how to wire it into the TV, but I got it going just before one. I wanted something more permanent than my phone — something that couldn’t glitch, couldn’t just “miss” what I was seeing. The tape clicked into place, the red light came on, and I left it to run while I sat in the dark waiting for the minute hand to slide forward.

At exactly 1:18, the static shivered and parted, and there was the preacher again. Same pulpit, same dark backdrop, the same crowd sitting rigid like dolls that had been arranged. His voice filled the room, warm and steady, but wrong in a way I can’t explain. He was talking about “the blood that cleanses,” speaking in a calm, rolling rhythm, until he veered without warning: “and the blood is not only for the cleansing of sin, but for the keeping open of the gate.”

He didn’t pause. He didn’t correct himself. He just kept going as though nothing strange had been said at all.

My eyes scanned the congregation automatically, and my stomach twisted when I found her again. Third row, aisle seat. My grandmother. I could see her better this time. She wasn’t staring blankly forward like the others. Her head tilted, just slightly, like she was straining to listen for something behind her. The angle caught the light, and for an instant her mouth seemed too dark, too deep, like it was hollowed out.

That’s when I noticed it. Back in the corner, past the last row where the shadows drowned most of the pews, something was sitting apart from the others. Not upright like a churchgoer, but slouched forward. Its back was arched unnaturally, hands dangling loosely between its knees as though it didn’t know how to hold them. Its skin was pale gray, wet-looking, stretched tight enough across the bones that it seemed ready to tear.

And the head. God, the head. Too long. The face drooped, jaw slack, lips drawn back from teeth that were too many, too sharp, like shards wedged into the gums. When the preacher spoke, its mouth moved too, matching him at first — then opening wider, wider, until it looked like the entire bottom half of its skull would split away.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. I don’t even remember the rest of the sermon. I just stared, waiting for it to look at me. And when the broadcast ended, when the screen collapsed back into static, I was shaking hard enough that I nearly dropped the tape pulling it out.

I rewound it right away. My hands were trembling so bad I could barely hit play. And of course, just like before, all that came through was snow. No pulpit. No congregation. No hunched figure. Just static — with a faint, wet crackle buried underneath, like someone breathing through water. I turned the volume up until the hiss filled the room, and I swear I could hear something underneath it. Not words, not fully, but the shape of them. Like syllables being formed in a mouth that didn’t belong on this side.

I shut it off before I could make sense of it.

Now I can’t stop thinking about the thing in the back pew. About the way it didn’t look at the pulpit, or the preacher, or even the congregation. It sat there, jaw yawning open wider than anything should, and it was looking straight at the camera. Straight at me.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I thought writing this down would help me process it, but all it’s doing is making me realize how far this has already gone. I can’t explain why the tape shows nothing but static, I can’t explain why my grandmother is there, and I sure as hell can’t explain that thing in the corner. I’m out of ideas. If anyone has any advice — anything at all — I need to hear it, because I don’t think I can handle another night of just sitting here waiting for it to happen again.
