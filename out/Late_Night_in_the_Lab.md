I had a really awful experience in my lab recently. I’ve been pulling a lot of late nights in the lab. My PI and I are aiming to submit this paper in the next two months or so, and it's important that it gets done if I want to graduate by next semester. I’m so very close, but there is still so much to do. It doesn’t help either that my lab mates and I have been constantly fighting each other for time on the microscope. The only time I can seem to find a long stretch free is after everyone goes home at night. 

I’m no stranger to working late. I like to work later in the evenings anyway as I’m not really much of a morning person. I’ve had several late nights leaving here with the sun peeking out in the east. So, with about a dozen freshly stained slides ready to go, the other night I booked the scope as soon as the day typically ends for my coworkers at 6pm. 

The sun is setting much earlier now that it's winter. I do like seeing the lights on the campus come to life from my lab window, with the trees decorated for the holiday season. It helps keep my spirits up to contrast the old and falling apart lab facility I spend all my time in. Our lab’s microscope is a decade old basic fluorescent scope kept in a repurposed utility closet in the hallway, far away from the windows. Being in there with the door closed and the lights off feels like being isolated in your own little world. The computer screen and the light going into samples creates the only illumination, aside from my phone. It has to be dark though, otherwise my slides will get over exposed. 

I settled in for a long night of imaging, and set up my favorite true crime podcast to play like I usually do for long sessions. Once I get going, time moves surprisingly fast, between finding cells to image and playing solitaire on my phone while the microscope does its thing. So by the time I had to use the bathroom, it was already 11pm. Every time I step out of the little closet, my eyes always have to readjust. The hallway fluorescent lighting is not an easy transition. As I walked to the bathroom I passed a few members of the custodial staff and smiled at them, saying hello. When I work nights I’m always appreciative to see them, as otherwise this place feels really creepy. It’s funny, I spend so much time here, but when you’re alone and it's dark, the squeaking of old rotors and the rush of the ventilation system sound a bit more menacing. 

I went to the bathroom and then grabbed some snacks and water. Each slide takes around two hours, so I needed a few nights to get through this experiment. I tried to amp myself up to settle in again. I don't like being at lab past midnight. The cleaning staff are all finished by then so I am really, truly, alone. The lights in the building are all on automatic motion timers, so most of the hallway and lab lights go out after long enough. It makes me feel like a little kid, but I just get really freaked out by being so alone. I always try to rush quickly to make them turn back on again when I move about. If I could, I wouldn’t leave my closet until 5am again, when the earliest risers come to check on their experiments. The closet doesn’t lock, but it does make me feel better to be in my bubble.

After my short break I settled in to go back to my slides. I realized at this point I should probably switch to a different podcast, it's a mistake I’ve made before to listen to scary stories late at night. I started my next z-stack and worked my way through another six games of solitaire. It must have been another two hours, I’d switched to the next sample not too long before, when I heard what sounded like a knock on the closet door. I just about jumped out of my fucking skin. 

Who the hell is here so late??? “Hello?” I called out. No response. “Hello, is someone there?” Nothing. I knew I should open the door to check. But god I did not want to. It was dumb of me but I kept imagining that someone was here to get me. Like the podcast had ramped up my paranoia. I argued with myself. There was no lock on the door. If a serial killer was really here to get me they could just yank it open. That was such a silly thing to think. But also sometimes the building creaks and from my headphones I just think it’s a knock, it was probably just that. So I didn’t have to open the door, right? I turned back to my imaging, and tried to settle my nerves back down. 

I continued onto the next field of cells. The images were taking way too long. I needed a wide z, not to mention the weak signal meant every channel took way longer than I would have liked. I kept going. Before too long, I had to pee again. I looked at the clock. It was 1:30am. I felt a knot in my stomach at the thought of walking all the way to the bathroom and back. But it couldn’t wait. I finished the current stack and then opened the door wide. I liked to let the room air out when I could, not just because of my own smell, but because the room was connected by vents to the tissue fixation room and the smell could get pretty strong seeping through even in the off hours. I hurried to the bathroom, walking way too fast. It would have looked odd if there were anyone around. I felt like a child running back to their room after turning the lights off downstairs so the monster wouldn’t catch me. The lights in the hallway came on as I moved through them.

I finished my business and repeated the same hurried journey back to my closet. With relief, I made it back to the door. Except. The door was closed? I had it wide, there’s no draft in this building, how did it close on its own? I debated with myself again. What was scarier, standing in this empty hallway or opening the microscope room? It had to have closed on its own. Just because it never happened before doesn’t mean it didn’t happen now. I yanked the door open and then quickly shut behind me. The room was empty. Obviously it was. I sat down to find a new field for the next image, still breathing a little too fast. I’m an adult for god sake. Why was I so nervous about this?

I turned on the blue channel, but I couldn’t see the cell’s nuclei any more. The microscope was way off from the focus I had just left it. It was in a different place on the slide too. I couldn’t take it anymore. I was so anxious I didn’t think I could focus. Surely there was a good explanation for it. But I was not going to find it now. I took my slide off and powered down the scope and computer, wiped the oil off the lens. I needed to get some sleep, this was enough for the night. I put my slide into my box and propped open the door, this time with the trash can so it would air out. I then hurriedly started walking down the hallway to my lab. 

When I turned the corner and entered the corridor where my stuff was to get ready to leave, I stopped. I hadn’t entered the lab space since my 11pm break, but the lights were on. I looked around, someone else had to be working here right? But my lab was the only lab with lights on. I didn’t see anyone around. 

Suddenly I heard a door slam shut loudly from the direction I had just come. I grabbed my stuff as quickly as I could and bolted towards the elevators. I pressed the button so aggressively before I realized I had to scan to call it. I swiped my badge. I was working myself into a panic. 

Then, things started to get bright. The lights in the parallel hallway, by the elevators, began to turn on one by one, beginning at the opposite end of the hallway where I was. I swiped my badge again and again as if that would make the elevator come faster. The doors opened with a ding as I rushed inside, hitting the close door button and the first floor button over and over again. The final light before the light above the elevators came on just as the doors closed. I felt my breath catch up with me. I was breathing hard. 

When I got to the first floor I rushed out of the building toward the parking lot. I practically ran to my car, frantically trying to reach for my keys in my bag. But they weren’t there. I suddenly had a memory of placing them on my desk and not back in my bag, and realized I had left them behind. I wasn’t going back up. Nothing was going to get me back up there until there were other staff here. Nothing. I would literally have to wait out in the freezing cold by my car for HOURS until the early morning cars started to arrive. But, I just couldn’t make myself go back to the lab, or even enter the building at all. 

When finally enough people had walked past my freezing ass to work, and the sun hinted itself in the sky, I went back inside. I took the elevator up, I scanned in, I grabbed my keys, and left without incident. Because of course I did. It’s so silly right? I risked freezing to death because I got a little spooked by some automatic lights and an old building? Right? I mean, I’m sure there is a good explanation for this. It should be fine for me to do another night, don't you think? I really have so much work I need to do...
