I work full time at a demanding office job; The kind that makes you watch the seconds pass on their tiny wall clock. Mike, my best friend since high school texted me last Tuesday. "Hey Kenny. Work is really wearing me down. Wanna go camping this weekend? There's this forest in Utah that has some nice views." Seeing as I had nothing planned, I agreed. I had never gone camping before in an actual forest, and a few days away from it all sounded like what I needed. By Friday night we were on the road, cracking jokes and talking about what we were going to do. When we finally got there, the sun was close to setting, so we grabbed our packs and half ran to find a spot to post up. About an hour later we were laughing by a fire, cracking a few cold ones. We cooked up dinner and listened to the quiet. Occasionally, a twig would snap and make me jump, much to Mike's amusement. "Kenny, it's just an animal. Quit being such a coward," he laughed. "Shut up man, I'm just not used to being this far out," I snapped back at him. 



A Few hours later me and Mike were passed out in our tent. At some point, I woke up. Something felt wrong; the woods were quiet, far too quiet to be normal. I tried to fall back asleep, but something just felt wrong. I went to shake Mike awake, but all I could feel was his sleeping bag; Mike was gone. Reaching for my flashlight, I left the tent and looked outside. I called his name, getting louder and more frantic. Then I heard it; a woman's singing slow and hauntingly beautiful. Something about the voice was so alluring, my feet move before I could think. As I walked closer, I saw the trees thinning, making a clearing. As I looked around, my eyes locked onto a figure; it was Kenny. He was walking through the clearing, eyes glazed over. Something about the way he looked snapped me out of it, "Mike! I was worried about you. Why did you wander off?" Mike just kept walking towards the singing. Chills crawled up my spine as I looked around for the source and, after a few minutes, I found it. There she was, in the center of the clearing, sitting in tall grass, with branches in her hair. 



When he got about ten feet away, she stopped her singing, and stood up. What I saw was worse than anything I could have imagined. Instead of normal legs, she had the whole body of a deer, and those branches? They were full sets of antlers. Mike woke up from his daze, wiping his eyes, "Huh? Kenny, where the hell am I? What happened?" My feet refused to move closer to that thing, even if it was to run to my best friend, "Mike, we need to run! Now!" Before he fully understood what was happening, she let out a scream that still haunts me, it was like the scream of an elk, but garbled in a way I can't describe. As we both turned, she changed. Her antlers grew, becoming more jagged and sharp; she raised up as her legs stretched, and ribs began to grow out of her body, making her look more insect than animal. Before I could think, I was tearing through the forest, towards what I hoped was the car. I heard mike behind me, yelling my name, but I didn't look back. I ran for what felt like miles, my lungs protesting each shaking breath until I saw the parking lot. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw my car; the same one I had cursed out just the day before. I fumbled with the keys, and got in. I waited for Mike to come bursting through the tree line. I waited a minute, then ten, then thirty. He never made it out of those woods.



As soon as I made it to town, I made a report, even though I knew I'd never see him again. It was labeled an animal attack, even though they never found him. The police knew; I could see it in their faces as I described what happened. I never got my stuff back, but I don't need it. I won't be going camping again for a long, long time.
