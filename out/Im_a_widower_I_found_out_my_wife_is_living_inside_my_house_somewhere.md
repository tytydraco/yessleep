I remember the first time I heard it.  


  
I was leaning back on my couch, watching TV, all alone in my house, just like any other night…   


  
…When I heard a cough.  


  
COUGH. COUGH.  


  
But not just any cough.  


  
A woman's cough.  


  
And not just any woman's cough.  


  
My wife's.  


  
The only catch was, she had been missing at the time, having disappeared a few months prior, after a trip to the store, never to be found, and presumed... the worst thing that could be presumed.  


  
So I did what seemed to make sense at the time, and chalked the sound up to a phantom laugh.   


  
But not a phantom like a ghost. I didn't think she haunted the house or anything.  


  
It was more like, the way people who lost limbs still felt them. So too, did I still feel my wife's presence in the house. Or so I rationalized.  


  
But then a few months later… it happened again.  


  
COUGH. COUGH.  


  
And then a year after that… yet again.  


  
COUGH. COUGH.  


  
It happened enough times, between the years that my wife had disappeared, and the fifth anniversary of her disappearance, that I began to grow... afraid of it.  


  
So I blocked it out.  


  
Until one day, when I just so happened to be sitting on the floor, back to the wall, drinking away my sorrows, and wondering why she, of all people, had to disappear, I heard the sound again.  


  
COUGH. COUGH.  


  
But this time, it was... different.  


  
This time, I felt a subtle reverberation, and heard what sounded like a hollow echo.  


  
I immediately stood up, turned around slowly, and looked at the wall.  


  
It was in that moment, that something crossed my mind.... that had never crossed it before.  


  
*What if the sound wasn't coming from inside the house, but between its walls?*  


  
It was such a disturbing thought, that my hands and body began shaking violently.  


  
If the sound was coming from a place that I hadn't searched yet, then it might be real.  


  
And if it was real…  


  
…Then who knows what horrors lay behind the walls.  


  
*But how could she even survive in such a place?* I wondered.  


  
I found out the next day, when I visited a contractor, who had helped us renovate a couple of the rooms in the house, when we had first bought it, years before.  


  
"I’ve been hearing noises inside the walls. And I have reason to believe that a very large animal might be living in there.” I explained to him nervously, unable to tell him what I really thought. “Is there enough space, for someone - I mean something, to live comfortably in there?”  


  
"Well, let me see.” He said, as he rummaged through his files, pulling out the original floor plans to my house, and laying them out on the table.  


  
He stood there, studying the blueprint for a minute, before finally pointing to it. “Honestly, yeah, there’s more than enough space in there.”  


  
Sure enough, when I looked down at where he was pointing, I saw a huge pocket of empty space between the rooms, almost as large as the rooms themselves.  


  
“You want me to recommend you a good exterminator?” He offered, “My buddy’s solid, and pretty cheap too.”  


  
“No, I'm okay.” I declined, before gesturing to the plans. “Mind if I take these with me?"  


  
But before he could even reply, I had snatched them off the table, hopped in my car, and peeled off.  


  
As I sped home, a million, terrible, thoughts raced through my mind.  


  
*Has she really been alive, inside the house, this whole time? Why would she be in there? What is she capable of? Is my life at risk? Should I go in there?*  


  
My first instinct was to smash through the walls, and confront her, but when I finally got back, I chickened out, and instead, tried, once again, to block the whole thing out of my mind.  


  
But the thought of her living inside the walls of my home, while I went about my day, continued to haunt me, and I eventually built up the courage to go in.  


  
Remembering an area of flooring in the ceiling of the basement, that had rotted away, and connected to the very area that the contractor had pointed to in the floor plans, I went down to the cellar, grabbed my ladder, and crawled up into the space between the walls.  


  
And what I saw on the other side… was terrifying.  


  
Scattered everywhere, were the abandoned possessions of someone who had clearly been living in there for years. The place was littered with everything from empty cans of food, to old water bottles, to clothes and books, and a thick layer of dust covered everything.  


  
But the strangest thing of all… was the sheer number of peep holes that I found, poked through the walls into my living room, kitchen, and bedroom, that I clearly hadn't seen from the other side.  


  
I then turned the corner into the next "room," and saw what looked like a trap door to the backyard, that she must have used sparingly over the years, likely whenever I left the house, to scavenge for food and water.  


  
And when I finally got to the last "room," I found...  


  
...My wife. Sitting there in a tattered dress, head down, reading a book, her back to me.  


  
"Eventually, I conjured up enough courage to say something. "Honey!"  


  
But just as I feared, she did not greet me with a warm embrace.  


  
Instead, she immediately whipped around and screamed, “You!”  


  
That’s when I saw her face, for the first time in five years. A face that now looked much older, and much more emaciated, from what must have been long periods of starvation.  


  
"Honey, it's ok! It's just me! I just want you to know that I love you." I tried to reassure her.  


  
But she wasn’t reassured.  


  
"You? Love me? How dare you say those words!"  


  
"What are you talking about? I've been mourning you for years.”  


  
"That's what you call it?"  


  
“Honey, what are you doing in here?”  


  
"I needed to know."  


  
"Needed to know what?"  


  
"Whether you actually loved me. Whether you'd miss me when I was gone."  


  
“And I did. I cried for a year straight.”  


  
"Yeah, and what about her?"  


  
"Her?"  


  
"The woman. That you brought home that night. Into our house?"  


  
"Dear, you had been gone for a year. And I didn't even enjoy it. I was sad, and lonely, and trying to-"  


  
"Move on?"  


  
"Yes! It's what people do when their partners are gone. It’s horrible, but they eventually have to."  


  
“Leave me! Or you'll regret coming in here."  


  
"But honey. I'll do anything."  


  
"Then show me."  


  
"Show you?"  


  
"Go back to the house. And show me you still long for me.” She commanded, before warning, “And if you ever bring another woman here for a night, it’ll be your last.”  


  
And so, I returned to the house, afraid of what she might do, and at the same time too afraid to leave, while she stayed inside its walls, to continue watching me, day and night.  


  
Still to this day, whenever I hear the sound of her coughing, from behind the walls…  


  
COUGH. COUGH.  


  
...It sends shivers down my spine, and I wonder... when she might decide to emerge, and what she might do to me when she emerges.
