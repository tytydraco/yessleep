Have you ever stopped to think about how fragile everything really is? I don’t mean in some abstract, philosophical sense - I mean the literal, physical world around us. The things we take for granted; the ground beneath our feet, the sky above our heads, the unbroken rhythm of day into night, night into day. We carry on with our meaningless routines, convinced that the sun will rise in the morning because it always has, and the stars will hang in their ancient patterns because they always do.

But what if it didn’t?

What if something slipped, even for a second?

Would we even notice?

I used to think about these things late at night. I suppose that was my first mistake.

It started one evening in early spring. I remember because there was still a bite in the air, though the days were stretching longer, teasing the arrival of summer. I was alone in my apartment, lights dimmed, blinds cracked just enough to let the dull orange glow of the setting sun smear across the wall like a fading bloodstain. I was nursing a sense of inexplicable unease that had been growing for weeks, a tightness in my chest I couldn’t explain.

Existential dread, they call it.

A sense that something is… off.

That the world you know is a veneer stretched tight over something vast, ancient, and malicious.

But that evening - I’d finally convinced myself it was nothing. That I was tired. That I needed to stop watching scary movies, stop chasing strange theories on obscure message boards. That night, I went to bed early, intending to wake up and get on with my life.

But then the sun blinked.

I swear to you, it did.

At first, I thought it was a power outage. The streetlights outside my window flickered, then extinguished altogether. But the world wasn’t plunged into darkness - not at first. It was something much worse

The light itself seemed to stutter. One moment, the room was bathed in twilight, the next it was… wrong. Not dark, not light. Just- absence. Like the sun had vanished for a fraction of a second. A single instant where the world hung suspended in nothingness.

I sat up, my heart hammering in my chest. I waited for it to come back. It did.

But it wasn’t the same.

The color of the light filtering through the window had changed. It was still sunset, but it had taken on a sickly hue - like old bruises, purples and greens and a dirty yellow. The shadows in my room no longer fell where they should have. They curled upward, clinging to the ceiling like cobwebs.

I told myself it was my imagination.
I told myself it was a trick of the atmosphere, maybe a solar flare.
I reached for my phone.

No signal.

No Wi-Fi.

No messages.

I tried to turn on the TV.

Nothing.

A strange silence had fallen over the world outside.

No cars.

No distant dogs barking.

No wind.

Just this thick, cloying quiet that pressed against the windows like a living thing.

And then - the knock.

A single, soft knock at my front door.

My stomach dropped. Every instinct screamed at me not to move, not to answer it. But curiosity is a cruel thing. Against my Evette judgment, I rose and crept to the door. I pressed my eye to the peephole.

There was nothing there.

I waited. Another knock.

Softer this time. Closer. I pulled back. The air in the hallway beyond my apartment seemed to ripple, as though the very fabric of reality was unraveling.

I didn’t open the door. I didn’t know if I could have if I’d tried.

I stumbled back into my living room, phone still useless in my hand, and it was then that I noticed the sky outside was wrong. The sun- if it could be called that - was a dim, baleful disk, too large, too close. It pulsed like a diseased eye, and the clouds around it twisted in impossible ways, forming shapes that felt uncomfortably deliberate.

I told myself I was dreaming. That I’d wake up. That none of this was real.

But then the knock came again - this time from inside my apartment.

I spun, searching the shadows, but there was no one there. Nothing but the sound. Knock. Knock. Soft, insistent.

It was coming from the walls.

I pressed my ear to the plaster, and the surface felt warm beneath my palm, like flesh. I could hear a low, wet scratching, as though something were trying to claw its way through from the other side.

I ran. I grabbed my keys and bolted down the stairwell, the air thick and heavy like a grave, I expected to find my neighbors, maybe others who had witnessed whatever was happening. But every door I passed was ajar, every apartment empty. Furniture overturned. Food left half eaten on plates.

It was as if everyone had simply vanished.

I made it to the street and froze.

The world outside was much worse.

The buildings around me had begun to… bleed. Dark ichor oozed from cracks in the brick and rain in thick rivulets into the gutter. The trees along the sidewalk twitched and convulsed, their branches clawing at the sky. And the sky itself was moving.

Not the way clouds move, not the way night falls.

It twisted and writhed, as though some immense, unseen thing was shifting just behind the veil of reality.

I wasn’t alone out there.

There were figures, tall and impossibly thin, moving through the streets. Their faces were stretched and featureless, skin pale and almost translucent in the dying light. They glided rather than walked, their limbs bending at unnatural angles.

They didn’t speak.

They didn’t make a sound.

But I knew - somehow - that they could see me.

I ducked behind a car, heart threatening to burst from my chest, one of them stopped mere feet away, its head tilting toward me with an eerie, boneless grace. I held my breath.

And then… it spoke.

Not with words, but directly into my mind.

“We see you.”

I ran.

I don’t remember how long I ran. Time didn’t mean anything in that place anymore. The sun hung motionless in the sky, still pulsing, watching. The streets twisted and shifted behind me, alleys leading to impossible places.

At some point, I found myself at the edge of town, where the road should have led to the interstate. But it didn’t. It led only to a great yawing chasm - an abyss that stretched into forever. From the depths rose a chorus of voice, whispering in a language I couldn’t understand but somehow knew was meant for me.

I teetered on the edge, tempted for one terrible moment to throw myself in, to escape whatever hell this was.

But something stopped me.

A hand.

Human.

Warm.

I turned, and there was a woman standing there. Pale, terrified, but alive. The first living soul I’d seen. She didn’t speak, only shook her head, and together we turned and fled back unit the dying town.

We’ve been running ever since.

I don’t know how long it’s been.

Days? Weeks? 

The sun never moves. The sky never changes.

There’s no food. No water. But we don’t die.

Not yet, at least.

The figures still hunt us, though we’ve grown better at hiding. They don’t like the old church at the center of town. Its walls bleed like the rest, but something about it keeps them at bay. At least for now.

We’ve found other, scattered survivors clinging to sanity in the shadows. Some have theories. That the sun itself was a prison, containing something ancient, something malevolent, and it….blinked.

Just once.

And that single, terrible moment was enough to tear a hole in reality.

And now it’s bleeding through.

We don’t know if the rest of the world still exists.

We don’t know if we’re the only ones left.

If you’re reading this, if by some miracle this message found its way out - don’t look at the sun.

Not even for a second. Because it might blink again.

And next time, it won’t open its eye.
