Day 1: my name is John Killinger, something has come up recently, and I'm terrified because I don't know even know where it is a robot voice keeps telling me to kill my family he said his name was "Shockton" He explained to me that he is an all-knowing robot who hops through infinite dimensions to tell people to kill their family for a cause he said to "become all-powerful" I don't believe it, but recently I was sleeping when I woke up and saw him standing there his red eyes glowing at me I couldn't make out more than that but it seemed he raised his hand to point and then I fell asleep again.

Day 2: I might snap, he tells me to do it every minute I can't even know where he is because no being can survive the void of destruction. remember who you are Kaden never forget the time when you cheated on that test, or you lost your pet that was me Kaden you are more significant than this. Who said that? I didn't say that, he altered reality to do that. asshole leave me alone I am not stupid, I won't kill my family "Fine then, I will do it myself" said the voice NO! Please don't I can't it's my life I choose my destiny not you! "I am absolute infinity do what I say" yelled the voice I can't do this anymore so I walked to the kitchen my mom greeted me "Woah you look like you just saw a ghost," I noticed I had a knife in my hand when I realized this I put it down. when suddenly I saw my mom disappear all my family vanished when my door opened up to a robot standing there with multiple universes inside of him he reached to me picked me up and yelled "I transcended an infinite amount of universes to become all-powerful I'm bending reality right now to show you just who I am" I looked around finding out everything was a part of him. coming back to reality I saw myself on the ground, my family, around me all were worried about me but I felt fine.

Day 3: I was at school when I saw my crush looking as beautiful as always I watched her as I opened my locker when I did I saw his head on the table of the locker "Do it" he said, I slammed the locker rushing to my class. science class dissecting some frogs as I was doing it I felt a presence behind me looking behind revealed Shockton helping me he stared at me intently, I was starting to freak out when my scalpel went flying hitting a student in the arm Luckily for me bell rang, walking through the hall I saw my crush hugging someone else Shockton I whispered to myself he put his conscious in another person to mess with me then they left holding hands he was staring at me the entire time his head turned like an owl to do this, for the rest of the day I couldn't think straight everywhere I looked he was there looking at me I saw the man dating her walking home alone I was going insane I walked towards him with my fist clenched and ready to fight I went behind him and punched him with all my force knocking him out then I ran home faster than I ever ran before.

day 4: I'm going to do it I grabbed the knife and did I kill them Shockton are you pleased I asked when the police showed up, no wait you got it all wrong Shockton forced me to, arrest him "Tell that to the judge."

John is not able to finish this story about who I am and his experience so I will post it for him, I better explain who I am.

My name is Shockton and I just finished my journey of becoming all-powerful now it's time to destroy the Tree of Creation the thing that holds the outer verge which holds the outer verses. I am above all things I know everything to happen or what is happening I created everything for my children.
