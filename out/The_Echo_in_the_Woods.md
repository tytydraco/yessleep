It was supposed to be a peaceful weekend. Ethan had been looking forward to the solitude of the woods for weeks, a break from the noise and chaos of the city. His friends had warned him about hiking alone, especially in the remote, dense forest that stretched for miles without a soul in sight, but Ethan had shrugged them off. He wasn’t afraid of the dark or the stories people told about these woods. Stories were just that—stories.

The sun was setting, casting a warm, orange glow over the canopy of trees. The forest floor was a patchwork of shadows, and the air was thick with the earthy scent of moss and damp leaves. As he walked, Ethan could feel the tension from the past week begin to melt away. He breathed deeply, relishing the stillness.

But then, just as the sun dipped below the horizon, he heard it—a faint whisper, so soft it was almost indistinguishable from the rustling leaves. Ethan stopped, listening. At first, he thought it was the wind, but then he heard it again, clearer this time. It was his name. “Ethan…”

He spun around, searching the trees for any sign of movement, but there was nothing. The forest was empty, or so it seemed. He chuckled nervously, convincing himself it was just his imagination. But as he turned back to the trail, the whisper came again, louder, more insistent. “Ethan…”

A chill crept down his spine. This time, there was no mistaking it—someone was calling him. But how could that be? He was miles from the nearest town, and he hadn’t seen another hiker all day. He hesitated, his instincts screaming at him to leave, but curiosity got the better of him.

“Who’s there?” he called out, his voice echoing through the trees.

There was no answer, just a brief, unnerving silence. And then, the whisper returned, but it wasn’t just saying his name anymore. It was repeating everything he had said, mimicking his tone perfectly. “Who’s there?”

Ethan’s heart pounded in his chest. This was wrong. The voice sounded exactly like his own, but distorted, as if played back through a broken speaker. He took a step back, his eyes scanning the trees for any sign of movement. The shadows seemed to be closing in, the once peaceful woods now feeling claustrophobic and oppressive.

“Stop it!” he yelled, panic rising in his throat. But the voice just echoed him again, mocking him. “Stop it!” It was getting louder, closer, as if it was circling him, though he couldn’t see anyone.

He turned to leave, but the trail he had been following had vanished, swallowed by the forest. Every direction looked the same—a maze of trees and darkness. The voice was relentless now, repeating everything he said, but also adding its own twisted words. “Come find me, Ethan. Come closer.”

Ethan’s breathing grew ragged as he stumbled through the underbrush, trying to find his way back. But the more he walked, the more disoriented he became. The trees seemed to move around him, shifting like shadows, confusing his sense of direction. And always, that voice followed him, sometimes whispering, sometimes shouting, but always there, just behind him.

In his panic, Ethan tripped over a root and fell hard onto the ground, the wind knocked out of him. As he lay there, gasping for breath, he heard something new—a soft rustling in the bushes nearby. He froze, his heart hammering in his chest. Slowly, he turned his head toward the sound.

At first, he saw nothing but darkness. But then, as his eyes adjusted, he saw a figure emerging from the shadows. It was tall and gaunt, its limbs unnaturally long, its movements slow and deliberate. But what made Ethan’s blood run cold was its face. It was his own face, pale and twisted into a grotesque smile, the eyes hollow and empty.

The figure moved closer, its smile widening. “Welcome home,” it whispered in Ethan’s voice, but the tone was wrong—sinister and full of malice. Ethan tried to scream, but no sound came out. He scrambled backward, but the figure reached out with a bony hand and gripped his arm with an icy touch.

As the figure’s grip tightened, Ethan felt his body go numb, a cold darkness creeping over him. The last thing he heard before everything went black was his own voice, laughing—a sound so distorted and twisted it barely resembled anything human.

The next morning, search parties combed the woods for Ethan. His friends had reported him missing when he didn’t return, and the rangers were familiar with the dangers of the forest. But despite their efforts, no trace of Ethan was ever found. The only thing they discovered was his backpack, abandoned in the middle of the trail, as if he had simply vanished.

Over the years, rumors spread about the forest. Some said it was haunted, others claimed it was cursed. But those who ventured too deep into the woods would sometimes hear a voice, calling their name, echoing their words, luring them deeper into the shadows.

None who followed the voice ever returned.
