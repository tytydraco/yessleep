Have you guys heard of From Florida, With Love? She’s this small lifestyle content creator I’ve been following for a while. Last night, she went live on TikTok, and honestly, I’m worried about her. Something really strange happened, and I don’t know who to contact about it or if I’m overreacting. I’ve attached some of her recent posts below…maybe you all can help me figure out if I should be doing something or if it’s just some kind of creepy coincidence?

# Discovering Our Dream Home: The Journey to Finding the Perfect Florida Oasis

# March 13, 2024

The house is perfect!

Wraparound porch? Check.

Original hardwood floors? Check.

Lofted ceilings? Check.

When I first rattled off my dream home wish list to our realtor, then quickly followed it up with our more modest budget, she gave me that polite-but-we-need-to-manage-expectations smile. I knew my list was a bit ambitious, but hey, that’s why they were wants, not needs. My husband, ever the practical one, countered with a list of sensible priorities—like a new roof and updated HVAC, especially since we live in Florida.

Our realtor, Lisa, diligently showed us one builder-grade home after another in cookie-cutter HOAs. But none of them felt right. The idea of living in a beige stucco home surrounded by Bermuda grass and a sea of snowbirds wasn't exactly thrilling. So we kept at it, clinging to the hope that something with a little more character was out there. Ben and I even decided we were open to an older home, maybe even something rural, as long as it had charm. A fixer-upper? No problem. We’re pretty handy.

When Lisa called one Sunday with what she described as our “dream home,” even she sounded surprised. It wasn’t officially on the market yet; the previous owner, an older woman, had recently passed away, and her out-of-state relatives wanted to sell quickly. They weren’t interested in coming to rural Central Florida to deal with the details, so they’d quietly floated it to local realtors.

By Monday morning, Ben and I were out there, bright and early. Whoever this lady had been, she had taken impeccable care of the place. Built in the 1920s from solid hardwood, the house sat on nearly five acres, tucked down a narrow side road surrounded by twisting scrub oaks and palmettos. The exterior was limewashed for protection against the Florida humidity, and the wraparound porch? It was perfection—complete with pots of swamp daisies and rocking chairs.

They were selling the house as-is, which had us a bit concerned about what we’d find inside. But to our surprise, the interior was charming, filled with faded oriental rugs, wooden furniture, and nothing more than what you’d expect from a tasteful, well-loved home. No hoarding nightmare here.

The previous owner, we learned, had passed away peacefully in her sleep at the age of 82. Somehow, knowing that made the house feel blessed—like it had been part of a long, peaceful life.

Despite its age, the inspection went better than we could have hoped. Just a few minor updates were needed—nothing we couldn’t tackle ourselves. So within a month, we were packing up our rental and moving into our new rural retreat, dogs in tow. We’re now a solid hour from the closest town, but considering Florida traffic these days, that’s really not much of a change, ha!

We’re mostly unpacked, and the dogs are loving their new freedom, chasing lizards through the palmettos. I keep worrying about snakes, but Ben reassures me that our dogs have it under control—they’re cur dogs, after all.

Oh, and here’s a funny twist: The old lady’s walnut four-poster bed is still here—the very one she passed away in. Ben is seriously creeped out by it and was ready to haul it into the backyard for a bonfire, but honestly, it’s gorgeous. It feels wrong to throw it out, and our mattress fits perfectly. Ben will adjust…eventually.

Once we get everything settled, I’ll post pictures. Ben is also trying to get me on TikTok (we’ll see about that!), so maybe I’ll share some videos too.

Until next time,

From Florida, With Love<3

# Trouble in Paradise? Update on the New Home

# April 4, 2024

Well, I figured out TikTok! I think.

Check out our journey as we renovate our dream slice of Old World Florida \*@\*FromFloridaWithLove across all social media platforms. For the more old school among us, I’ll still be updating here regularly—there’s something about long form writing I just can’t shake.

One thing new homeowner guides never seem to mention: watch out for wild hogs. They’re invasive here in Florida, and they tear up just about anything I try to plant. Ben took matters into his own hands and set up game cameras around the property, along with motion-sensor flood lights ringing the house to try to keep them at bay. Lately, I’ve noticed him keeping the hunting rifle extra clean, and he’s been eyeing deep freezers online. I’m starting to think slow-cooked wild hog may be making an appearance on our dinner table soon.

Ben swears the flood lights are working, but all I know is they’re waking me up six times a night now, blasting the bedroom in blinding light. If any of you have recommendations for good blackout curtains, please let me know. Ben’s also become obsessed with the game cameras. They stream live footage directly to his phone whenever they detect motion, and he’s glued to them, waiting to catch a glimpse of the hogs. I think he’s hoping to catch a sow so he can stop the endless stream of little hoglets running amok.

But the other night, things got...strange.

It was around 2:30 in the morning when all the flood lights suddenly switched on at once, lighting up the entire house like it was midday. I’ve had about enough of being woken up by those lights, so I elbowed Ben awake to share in my misery. He could sleep through a bomb going off, I swear. As soon as he’s awake, his phone starts buzzing non-stop with motion alerts from all the game cameras. One after another, they go off, and remember, he’s got eight of these things scattered throughout the woods.

Here’s the weird part—when Ben starts clicking through the alerts, there’s nothing there. No hogs. No deer. No bears. Just empty frames. He thinks maybe some bugs set off the cameras, or maybe the flood lights malfunctioned, because we didn’t see anything when we looked out the windows either.

The next morning, Ben went through the footage again and found one blurry frame of… something. We can’t figure out what it is. If you’ve got any theories, we’re all ears. I’ve attached the photo below.

*\[Image: A grainy night vision still frame timestamped 0243 on April 2, 2024. The image shows oak trees with palmettos at their base. Between two trees, a blurry form—around six feet tall—leans into the frame.\]*

Until next time,

From the strange and wild world of rural Florida,<3

The view pans over to a tree, where a stand is hidden amongst the branches. The black-haired man waves from his perch, hunting rifle in hand. The woman behind the camera laughs.\]*

# Update on the Wild Hog Situation

# April 19, 2024

I know it’s been a few weeks since my last post, but TikTok has been more fun than I expected. Short-form content might be more my speed than I originally thought. But you all deserve a proper update on Ben’s ongoing battle against the wild hogs.

So far, he’s shot quite a few, and he’s definitely getting better at processing them—though there are only so many ways I can cook hog before I start losing my mind. The real challenge, though, has been keeping the dogs away from the carcasses. Ben bought them these anti-hog vests just in case one ever gets too close. They’re hilarious—picture our two stocky dogs wearing what looks like armored porcupine suits.

*\[Image: Two stocky tan dogs standing in the yard, sporting bulky canvas vests lined with metal spikes. They look like little porcupines bristling with attitude.\]*

The floodlights and game cameras are still giving us trouble in the middle of the night, but thanks to your amazing blackout curtain suggestions, I’ve finally been able to get some decent sleep. We’re pretty sure it’s just animals tripping the sensors. Ben found a forum that mentioned how night vision can mess with the shutter rate and cause lag in the live stream, so sometimes the animals slip by unnoticed. Still, we’ve managed to capture a few clear shots of our nocturnal visitors.

*\[Image: A night vision still frame timestamped 0125 on April 7, 2024. The grainy image shows a Florida black bear sniffing curiously at the camera lens.\]*

*\[Image: A night vision still frame timestamped 2348 on April 11, 2024. The grainy image shows a stag and two doe mid-motion between several trees. In the background, another set of antlers hovers unnaturally high—around two meters off the ground—barely visible behind a tree.\]*

*\[Image: A night vision still frame timestamped 0311 on April 12, 2024. The grainy image shows a hog sow and her babies rooting through the dirt in a forest clearing.\]*

*\[Image: A night vision still frame timestamped 0243 on April 17, 2024. The grainy image shows a hog at the far edge of the camera’s range. The animal is balanced awkwardly on its back two legs, its front legs dangling limply at its sides. Its eyes flash bright green in the night vision, staring blankly at the camera.\]*

We’ve started to wonder if something’s wrong with the hogs around here. Have you heard of that fungus that infects deer and makes them act like zombies? Lately, we’ve seen a few hogs that don’t seem scared of us—but they aren’t aggressive either. It’s unsettling. Ben’s tried to shoot them, but they keep slipping away.

We’ve moved a few game cameras closer to the house, hoping to catch a better look at what’s been creeping around. Ben found a deer carcass dangling from an oak branch while checking the hog traps the other day. Panthers are known to stash their kills up in trees, so we’re thinking there might be one nearby.

It seems like we’ve accidentally moved into our own little zoo. I’ll keep you all updated on what we find next. Stay tuned for more strange encounters!

Until then,

With love from the wilds of rural Florida <3

*@*TeapotSpillSesh | Check out this weird clip from last night’s live *@*FromFloridaWithLove

*\[Video Transcript: It’s dark, the camera tilted up with the faint outline of a ceiling fan barely visible. Heavy breathing can be heard off-camera as a man whispers, "It's got to be a panther, right?" The camera shifts downward to reveal a curly-haired woman sitting up in bed, her eyes wide.*

*She whispers to the camera, "We just heard the craziest sound outside. It's like, what, 3 AM?" She glances at the man next to her, her voice shaky.*

*"Yeah," he confirms, his tone uneasy. "And I swear it sounded like a woman screaming."*

*The camera flips, showing the darkened bedroom as the man gets out of bed, creeping toward a curtained window. He pulls the curtain aside slowly, revealing their forested yard bathed in floodlight. The trees are still. Nothing stirs.*

*“Check the game cameras,” the woman urges, her voice tense. She turns to the camera, eyes wide. “Y’all, this is insane. Of course, the first time I go live, and there might be a panther outside.”*

*The camera then shifts focus to a phone screen as the man flicks through the live feeds of their game cameras—empty scenes of the dark forest flash by.*

*"Wait! Go back," the woman suddenly says, her voice rising in alarm. "What was that?"*

*The man freezes and taps back to the live feed from the camera facing the house. On the far left, near the bedroom window where their silhouettes are backlit by the soft glow of their room, something lurks just beyond the edge of the floodlights. The figure is barely visible, stock-still.*

*"Oh my god! Is that it?" The woman whisper-shrieks, panic creeping into her voice. "Is that a panther?"*

*"It doesn't... it doesn't look right," the man mutters, zooming in. The figure remains grainy, but it’s clearer now—it's standing on two legs, small, about four feet tall, unmoving.*

*Suddenly, something smacks against the bedroom window—hard. The camera jolts as the woman gasps, eyes wide with terror. She scrambles back from the window, her voice trembling. “What the hell was that?!”*

*The man moves quickly, blocking the camera with his body as he reaches for the woman, pulling her away.*

*Another smack, louder this time. The unmistakable sound of glass cracking echoes through the room. The woman screams, the camera shaking violently as they bolt from the room. The house is pitch black, shadows twisting in the movement, nothing in focus. Their frantic whispers cut through the darkness—chaos.*

*The dogs are barking now, sharp and panicked. A door slams open with a jarring crash. There’s more shouting, cut by the chilling sound of a shotgun being pumped.*

*The camera captures nothing but blurry shapes as footsteps pound away.*

*A shotgun blast pierces the air. Then another.*

*Screaming follows, but it’s unclear whether it’s human or animal.*

*A hog squeals somewhere close.*

*The video ends abruptly as the phone clatters to the floor, cutting the live feed.\]*

I’ve been following this creator for years, ever since she started posting on her blog. She’s never done anything remotely like a prank or a joke, so I really don’t think this is staged. But honestly, I’m not sure what to believe anymore. Has anyone else seen this? I don’t know exactly where she lives in Florida, but if anyone has any idea, do you think I should call in for a wellness check? I’m genuinely concerned something’s not right.

I’ll post an update if I figure anything out.
