We have all had that feeling of being watched havnt we. 

Well I have been watched nearly all my life so far. 

I am male 22 and live in the south of England and for years there has been a man I see in the corner of my eye. 
He's big, dressed in black and he has always stood quite a few feet away from me but lately he's been getting closer.

Ive never see this man's face and I can never talk to him because as soon as I turn around he disappears.

Let's start with a bit of back story. This man hasn't always been there my earliest memory of the man was when I was about 7 years old I had fallen over and cracked my skull open and briefly died for 2 minutes. It wasn't until I was outside being wheeled to the car that I noticed out the corner of my eye someone dressed in black but when I looked there was no one there. 

I didn't think anything off it at the time until later on throughout the years I kept noticing him out the corner of my eye just stood, watching. He appeared when I was walking home from school one day, I had just crossed the road and nearly got hit by a car and then there he was just out of my field of view, watching once again. 

Then there was the time I was 17 years old I had just bought my first motorbike it was a lovely yamaha tw 125 and 2 weeks into riding I had a nasty crash and ended up going under a bus knocking myself out. 
I was lucky that the bus at the time had stopped to pick people up because otherwise if it was moving I dont think I would have survived. But then again when I came to I could see the man again but this time he seemed to be a little closer. 

Fast forward a couple of years I'm celebrating my 19th birthday up in  Bath with my friends at uni we all get stupidly drunk, smoke some weed, having a laugh. But then for whatever reason I stepped outside to have a cigarette. So there I was high and drunk. Cigarette in one hand and a beer in the other and I get this feeling I'm being watched so then I look around but can't see anyone. Until my brain realises actually I can see someone, the same someone I've been seeing for years but my brain has just shut it out. And yes there he is once again. The man although this time he is much closer just up the road from me. I can't make out any details except the black clothes and the hood up. Obviously me being obviously scared I run back inside. 

I've never told anyone about the man out of fear I'll get put somewhere for mental people. Because the same thing happened to my mum she could see people all the time that were not there but I just assumed that was because of the amount of drugs she used to be on.

And then there was 2 weeks ago I saw the man again but this time he was only roughly 5-6 metres away from me. I had just gotten over this god awful illness that's been going round. Coughing my guts up like I'm sure you've all had aswell. Except this time I didn't just see the man with my own eyes I also saw the man in my sleep. 

So these past couple of days I've been looking over my shoulder because now I feel constantly watched. The feeling never goes away but these past couple of days I havnt been seeing the man out the corner of my eye now I swear I see him in the mirror sometimes literally just a few feet away from me or sometimes very briefly directly on my shoulder but of course when I turn there is no one there and for some reason I still cannot make out any details apart from.... 

The black clothes and the big black hood covering his face.
