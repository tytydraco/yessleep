A light beep awoke me. It took me a few seconds to realize it had emanated from my phone. What the fuck? Who would have a reason to speak to me at 4am?

I reached for my phone. It displayed a message that had originated from "KEVIN". I stared at the accounts name, but no one I knew came to mind.

I replied.

"Who is this again?"

A reply arrived almost instantly.

"I'm Kevin, remember? We knew each other a few years ago."

Now that I thought about it, I had actually had a friend with that name a few years ago. Still, we hadn't spoken for years. He had no reason to speak to me.

"Sure... But why are you contacting me now? It's 5am."

Another instant response.

"I... Need your help with something. I planned a vacation here a few weeks ago, but my hotel cancelled my reservation. I just landed. Any chance I could stay at your home for... Maybe a day?"

It was a surprising response, but I considered it. My home happened to be large enough to accommodate multiple people. Multiple guest rooms, bathrooms etc. My only reason to decline is that I hadn't spoken to this man in years and had no guarantee this was him. Chances are, this was a coincidence.

"Sure, but before I give you my address, could you send me a photo of you? So I can be sure this isn't a joke?"

An instant answer.

"Of course. Here you go..."

The picture appeared on my screen. I recognized the man in the image. He had basic facial features, barely noticeable eyebrows and comically short, brown hair. I had some image of him in my camera roll, so I compared them. There were differences, as to be expected after over 3 years, but the images looked similar enough.

A message appeared beneath it.

"About your address, don't bother sending it to me. I remember it."

He knew my address? This was, of course, normal, considering I had known him a few years prior, but I didn't think he would remember my address. He moved to Austria and seemingly cut all forms of contact with me. It felt unusually deliberate at the time, so I didn't think he'd remember anything about me at this point, especially not my exact address.

"You know my address? What is it?"

He sent the exact address to me.

"Yep! That's the correct one. How long will it take you to get here?"

"Two hours at the most. I still need to get my luggage, but I'L be here in an hour once I leave the airport."

"See you then, I guess."

After a few minutes, another message came through.

"Oh, and do you happen to have any food?"

"Yeah, why do you ask?"

"My dog hasn't eaten for a day now."

He had a dog? That was new...

"Is it... Fine with you if I bring my dog...?"

"Of course, but I don't have any dog food."

"Do you have chicken?"

"I think so..."

"Is it okay If I give that to my dog? He's hungry as shit."

"Sure... Why not. I'll just buy more."

"Alright then! See you in a few hours."

I put my phone down.

Well, that was unexpected. I didn't plan on letting anyone stay here any time soon. Oh well, I had no reason to decline this. He'd only be here for a day, and something about a coincidence like this felt interesting to me.

I took a shower, changed into relatively normal looking clothes... And passed out on the couch.

The doorbell awoke me. It took a few seconds for me to recollect my memories, and realize who this was. I picked up my phone and checked the security camera footage. The blurry recording showed someone standing behind the gate. The figure seemed to be moving in a weird fashion. Perhaps Kevin was drunk?

Then something disturbing dawned on me. The figure was extremely tall, to the point were I could see his forehead above the 2m gate. There was no way Kevin had gotten this ridiculously tall in this timeframe, so... Perhaps this wasn't Kevin? But who else would have a reason to be here?

I switched to the camera footage outside. It showed a man resembling Kevin, but something about him, aside from his height was off. His face was longer than it should have been. Now I could see the extent to which it added to his height. He stared at the camera. I was the first to speak.

"Are you... Kevin?"

"YEEEeesss..."

His response was drawn out, a vacant expression appeared on his face as he spoke.

"Are you gooiinng too lett meee inn????"

"Are you okay? Your voice sounds weird."

"Yeeesssss..... Of coouuurse I aaamm!!! Now leeet me IN..."

I decided against it. Who wouldn't after witnessing someone act like this.

"Are you drunk or something?"

"Nooooooooooo!!! Whyyy would I BBB... Bbbb...."

His face contorted.

"LET MEEE INNNN!!! LETT MME IINNN NOOOOWWWW!!!"

I slowly walked to the kitchen, grabbed a knife, and returned to the door.

He began to bash at the doors furiously, his jaw open at a morbid angle.

"Calm down. Someone will call the police on you"

"LEEEET ME INNN!!!!!!"

"No. I won't let you anywhere near me in this state."

He resumed banging at the gates.

"I SAID LET ME IN! NOW!!!!"

I picked up my phone. I was going to call the police, but then he stopped.

"What's wrong?"

"I... Can't... Move..."

He remained standing there, his hands holding the gates.

"Aaa... Aaah... Stooooop... Lett... Me... In..Noooooooowww....."

He stood there, hands on the gate, drooling and heaving as he stared ahead.

The footage was interrupted by a call.

From Kevin.

I picked it up, ready to insult the shit out of that asshole for leading whoever or whatever the fuck was at the gate, however he didn't give me this opportunity. He spoke immediately.

"It's outside, isn't it? I knew it. i fucking knew that thing would wait for me there. Whatever you do, don't let it in."

"You think I'm retarded enough to let it in? YOU led it here! What the fuck even is IT? Some drunk stalker? How long has he been following you?"

"A stalker? A stalker? Holy shit! You clearly have no idea what's happening. Oh well... What did I expect?"

"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHAT THE HELL IS THAT THING?"

"I'll explain later. I'm nearly at your house. If you see someone who resembles me approaching, let them in. The other one will leave when I arrive. I can guarantee it."

He hung up.

I stared at the camera, still armed with a knife, breathing heavily as I stared at the darkness behind the figure as it kept panting at the gate. The sound of a car approaching dragged the figure from it's focus. It spoke once again.

"He... Here... Can mooooovvvvve."

It ran into the darkness, practically dragging its hands behind him.

A silhouette appeared. The HUMAN Kevin this time.

"Alright then. Let me in before it returns."

"If you tell me what the fuck is going on."

"Of course. Now let me in before it finds me."

I unlocked the door so he could enter my yard. He walked up to the door. I opened it.
