&#x200B;

As I emerged onto the terrace, I heard Bea below call out for Ethan as she ran toward the bathroom. I didn't slow down, though; I turned and booked it down the hallway. I could see Him waiting at the end, but he turned again down another corridor once I got too close.

"What's going on?" I heard Ethan ask Bea in a frantic tone. However, their voices quickly faded as I delved deeper into the unforgiving, dark tunnel. I followed Him down several twists and turns until finally, he halted in a doorway that blended into another room. Once I was a few feet away, I stopped, and we simply stared each other down. He grinned inhumanly as if he didn't truly comprehend the emotion he displayed but was only doing so for appearance.

"Hey, Brother. It's been a while."

I didn't say anything. I just stared, analyzing his every movement. He had none. He was utterly still. No breathing. No blinking. Not even a sway in his body. He was motionless like a statue.

"Something wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost."

"What… What are you?"

He cocked his head to the side as if he didn't understand the question or as if it was a dumb one. He didn't even return an answer. Instead, he echoed words that had haunted me for a long time.

"Just stop. I don't really care to hear what you have to say."

I winced, and a pit formed in my stomach. I didn't want to hear this again. I had heard it enough in my head when my mind replayed the scene over and over. My hair stood on end, though, when against my will, the scene continued.

He opened his mouth, and in my own voice, I heard, "Please, man… I'm not trying to defend myself; I just need you to know how sorry I am."

He continued the conversation in His own tongue once more, "If you're so sorry, then why? Why did you do it? Even after you had the chance to stop, why?"

"I-I don't… I don't know, I just…."

I remembered that response well if it could even be called that. It was pathetic. I couldn't even give a reason.

"Look, it doesn't matter, I just… I can't, Joel. I don't know if I can talk to you anymore."

It hurt all over again to hear that sentence twice.

"You don't mean that… I can make this up to you, I swear. I-"

"Stop. Please. My mental capacity is at its limit. I just need time to think. Please don't try to contact me anymore. If I want to talk, I'll come to you, okay?"

He turned in the doorway and went to leave, but before he did, he looked back and uttered the last sentence I had ever heard Him say, "I still care about you so much, Joel. That's what makes this hurt so much more."

I stood frozen as he disappeared into the darkness. I felt so weak. My legs shook, and I had to support myself against the wall. My lungs cried out for breath, but nothing came. My head churned violently with vertigo, and I looked down at the floor. Things were about to get much worse, however.

The ground below me was a familiar carpet; A style I had seen long, long ago. There was nothing truly of note about it, just old brown, moldy carpet. The only reason I remembered it was because of the bloodstain. A familiar trail that had been Daniel and I's guide our first night into the basement. Andi's blood. The other half that had been cut off in the doorway so long ago at the top of the house. And now it continued all the way down here. My dizzy mind stumbled to pick up shattered thoughts and piece them together. The blood trail, the hotel hallway that turned into a hospital, and Larry's last words: "your rooms are looking for you."

I let myself tumble to the ground as I felt the seam where the carpet met tile in the doorway. How had I been so blind? How had I not pieced it together before? This place was never conventional, and all the red flags were right in my face. All of the distance we had walked, all of the time I had spent mapping, the whole mission we had set out to accomplish was pointless because this place couldn't be charted.

The rooms were moving.

Shock held me for a moment before a new emotion began to bubble up within me. One I hadn't let take hold in a very long time. Rage. Tears pooled in my eyes as I ripped my backpack from my shoulder, tore the zipper open, and lobbed my collection of maps onto the floor. One by one, I pulled them open and furiously ripped at the pages within, letting the useless scraps form into a heap around me. He had led me here on purpose. He knew I had figured out his charade and wanted one last dig at me. Beat me down and then crush my soul.

My heart tore with every page of hard work. Not only was all our progress in vain, but now so was Daniel's sacrifice. He gave his life believing that we could finish that map and get everyone home. Not only was that dream a lie, but now my friends and I were stranded miles below the surface in a dark abandoned tangle with no idea where to go. For all I knew, we could have been running in circles as the rooms shifted eternally around us. Behind me, I heard footsteps approaching, but I continued to hack away at the notebooks. When Bea and Ethan finally rounded the corner, I heard them call out.

"Joel? What the heck, man!? Don't ever run off like that!"

Bea suddenly realized what I was doing and let out a gasp, rushing forward and grabbing my arm in an attempt to stop me. "Joel, what are you doing!? Stop it!"

I tried to brush her off, but the harder she restrained, the more my anger simmered down into pure despair. My tears turned into sobs as I grit my teeth.

Ethan stepped forward, "Joel, what's happening? Are you okay?"

I wiped my face and then shook my head, smacking a pile of scraps into the air. "It doesn't matter."

Bea and Ethan looked to one another, "What? What doesn't matter."

"This! Any of it! Our whole trip down here was pointless! All the dead ends! All the months walking and running and hiding! All these-- damn pages!"

"Joel, what are you talking about?" Bea asked softly.

"The rooms, this place… it's all shifting. This one was one of the first places Daniel and I passed by. This blood trail was Andi's. Back at the top, remember?"

Ethan looked confused, "Bea and I never passed a blood trail."

I squeezed my eyes shut in pain. They left not long after us, and the trail had already gone. That meant the rooms changed fast.

Bea slumped back onto the floor and placed a hand to her head, "Are you sure? Maybe it was just a coincidence? There could always be more blood trials. I mean, look at this place."

I shook my head, "Before Larry died, he told Daniel and me that our rooms were looking for us. Not long after, we ended up in Daniel's room. And there was that hallway, Bea. Remember? The one that changed?"

She shook her head in disbelief but offered nothing else. I could see on her face that all the same revelations I had had moments ago were coming to her. I began to fall back into despair alongside her, but Ethan quickly caught us.

"So what?"

I raised my head to him and looked at him critically, "Ethan, the map means nothing now. The whole point of coming down here was to know how to lead everyone else back once we found the exit."

"We can still do that, though, without the map. I mean, think about it. If we hadn't learned about this now, we would have figured it out eventually, maybe even once we had gone back and gotten everyone. In that case, we would have had no other option than to just keep doing what we're doing now."

"What are you saying?" I asked.

"I'm saying that all of this isn't for nothing. We just do what Andi did. We keep going and make sure there really is an exit. Then, once we know, we go all the way back, grab everyone else and make the trip again."

"But the point of the map was to get back as quick as possible," Bea said into her knees. "The longer we travel, the more we risk more people dying."

Ethan nodded. "I know. But at this point, I think we're running out of options." He crouched down, lowering to where we were. "We knew this wasn't going to be easy, guys… I know I did. Staying up in those six rooms would have been so much easier. And yet we still charged down here into the dark. This is about more than our lives at this point. This place has taken so much from us. From people before us too. Even if just one of us makes it out, then we win. We beat whatever sick force brought us here. Maybe we can even figure out a way to tell people about it and not sound crazy. Find some way to save anyone else who may end up like us."

Bea and I looked at him, and he smiled with pure confidence. He meant what he was saying with all of his heart.

"C'mon. There can't be much left. We can do this. I know we can." He held out a hand to me, and after a second, I took it. Once he had helped Bea up, I spoke.

"Dude, that was really cheesy. Did you see that in a movie or something? I mean that part about winning sounded straight from a sports film."

He laughed, "Hey, it worked, didn't it? Those scriptwriters really know how to bring the emotion."

"Alright," Bea said, "So what now? We just keep pushing on?"

"If you guys are ready."

"Yeah, I'm good now. Let's go."

"Hey, on the plus side, Joel, at least you don't have to worry about drawing the map anymore."

"Too soon, Bea. Too soon."

The three of us walked forward with newfound vigor, following the crimson stain on the carpet. While I had made fun of him for it before, Ethan was right about what he had said. We still had a job to finish, regardless of the new circumstances. We had decided that following the trail from Andi would most likely be the fastest way forward. Even though we knew the house was shifting, it was pretty clear by what she had said before she passed that Andi was hurt near the exit. That meant if we followed her trail, whether it led us there or not, it still might get us close. This stain lasted much longer than the first, winding through halls, across large rooms, and trailing down steps. I cringed at the thought of Andi slowly bleeding out as she desperately climbed for the surface. The trail slowly got thicker and more severe the further we went, most likely due to her slowly running out of blood. That thought also made me sick.

There was another admittedly selfish reason that I wanted to follow the trail. Deep down, part of me really needed to know what had caused her injuries in the first place. I had so many cherished memories of Andi, and yet for all of the good ones, the one that surfaced the most in my mind was the image of her dying in my arms. Her pale, tired face, relieved to see us as she lay lacerated and bleeding out. My mind went to so many dark places, trying to imagine what could have possibly cut her up so bad. After seeing what the ballerinas were capable of, I didn't know if I wanted to find out, but on the other hand, I knew that I needed the closure, for better or for worse.

Not having to stop and map helped the journey greatly, as now it really didn't matter if I remembered which way we went or not. It would all change later, eventually. Each day we had lost nearly two hours of combined time just stopping to record, but now we were cruising. We delved down flight after flight, sometimes even running periodically. There were points, however, that we had to slow down and cover our mouths, though. Mold had always been a prevalent problem in all layers of the house, but in these deeper sections, it seemed to be clumped on almost any surface it could gather. Carpet, drywall, ceiling panels. For the most part, it wasn't overly offensive, but some patches were so bad that we were afraid breathing too much might have severe repercussions.

When we passed down another flight of steps, we ended up at a hall where a dark doorway sat waiting for us at the end. Next to it, another corridor went off to the right. We began making our way down, still following Andi's former path, when I started to think more about the circumstances before us. It's funny how some things that seem obvious in hindsight can be overlooked under such stressful circumstances.

"Wait up," I told the others as we stopped before the doorway. The crimson trail led straight into its dark maw. "We should go this way," I said, pointing down the other open corridor.

"I thought we wanted to follow the blood?" Ethan asked.

"I know, but something seems off about it…."

"What do you mean? You don't think it's Andi's?" Bea questioned.

"No, I do, but that's the problem. It took us months to get down here, and it would take months to get back up, right?"

"Yeah?"

"Andi made it sound like she got hurt by the exit, and she was obviously bleeding out a lot. If that's the case, then there's no way she could have survived the trip back up before giving out."

"You're right..." Ethan noted, "So what do you think happened then? How did she get back up?"

I thought about Him and how He had led me to the trail again when I had followed. Something about whatever He was knew more about the house than anything we had encountered so far, besides maybe the Curator.

"I think the house let her get back up. I think it knew we would follow in her steps."

Bea made a face of concern and confusion, "Whoa, hang on, is there something you're not telling us?"

My eyes darted to the floor, and she immediately picked up on the queue. "The blood trail; you ran off and immediately knew where it was. How did you know, Joel?"

I took a deep breath, then spoke, "You know how you said you see your sister sometimes? You said she shows up and talks to you?"

Bea looked taken back, and her eyes nervously shifted to Ethan as if self-conscious her secret had been told. "W-well, I mean, yes, I- I see her, but I don't know if-"

"It's okay, Bea." I jumped in, realizing my insensitivity, "I see someone too." She looked at me quizzically, and Ethan looked between us, trying to catch up. "Since we got here, I've seen an old friend of mine a lot. He comes to me and does the same thing. At first, I thought they were hallucinations, but it's been different ever since we came down here. He's told me things that my mind wouldn't have known on its own, and there was one time that I think I even physically touched him."

"Oh my gosh…."

"I know. And when you told me about how you see it too, He was there smiling at me from the balcony, like he knew I had figured it out; that he's more real than I thought. When I went to follow him, he led me to the trail."

Ethan shook the shock of what he was hearing and spoke up, "So, what does all of that mean then?"

"Well," I started, "I think it means there's something down here messing with us, and I don't know how, but I think it's somehow related to the house. There's a room for everyone, right? What if it's trying to lure as many of us out as it can to trap us? If it wanted to do that, then letting Andi come back and confirm there's a way out would be the best way to do so."

"If that's the case, then isn't it possible there's no exit at all?" Bea said nervously.

My heart faltered at the question, "Maybe, but I don't know if she would have told us had she not been certain somehow." I looked back to the stain in the carpet at our feet, "The point is, I think whatever He- it, is, led me to the trail again to lure us somewhere. That's why I think we should go the other way."

Bea and Ethan looked at each other, silently considering the options. After a moment, they looked back at me.

"Yeah. I agree."

"Me too.

"You guys sure? I really don't want to be wrong about this…."

"Of course." Bea said with a smile, "And even if you are wrong, you've always got us to clean up the mess after.

"That's good," I chuckled softly, "I'm pretty good at making messes."

&#x200B;

The bedroom was still and quiet that night. Even Mark's breathing was more steady and silent than usual. I was worried that it might make it harder to leave the room, but it more than likely meant that everyone was just sleeping better than normal. After the long night of conversation we had all just had, everyone was probably exhausted. It wasn't strenuous activity by any means, but the mental stimulation after so long of not interacting certainly took a toll on us. Well, almost all of us. I still lay awake as usual, looking up at the ceiling of 6,248 dots. I considered counting them one last time, just to be sure, but I didn't bother. The rules were rules. Three times in a row meant it had to be correct. There was nothing left to do. It was over. I sat up in place and looked over everyone.

Bea curled onto her side a spot away from me, leaving a gap where Andi once slept, and Ethan lay to my other side on his back, facing straight up at the ceiling. I loved them so much. I hoped they would be okay without me. I surveyed the rest of the room at all the peaceful sleeping faces. Jan next to mark, Claire, Ben, Grace. Even Daniel seemed to be resting well, something that had been difficult for him ever since Larry. It was a great way to see them all before I left. With a quiet breath, I slowly stood and stepped over to the door.

"Goodbye, everyone," I whispered almost inaudibly.

I stepped into the hall and swallowed the nerves growing in my gut. There was nothing behind me now. Just a room with 6,248 dots on the ceiling. I looked down toward the kitchen, where the familiar turn into the area set my heart into a rhythmic beat. Slowly, I walked heel over toe past the living room door and dark bathroom. I was about to pass by the dining room entrance when a very minor detail caught my attention.

Dark bathroom.

We always left the light on. It wasn't anything too out of the ordinary, probably just an accident. It wouldn't have been the first time someone accidentally turned it off, a remnant of our old lives. For no good reason, I took a few steps back and reached through the door, flicking it back on. It was the very least I could do for the others. Once light glowed into the corridor once again, I continued my journey. However, once I passed the dining room doorway, that's when the minor detail became a major red flag.

The front door in the sunroom was open.

My heart froze in my chest as I stared at the cheap white slab, swaying gently on its hinges. Opposite of it, I could barely see a figure standing in the sunroom and staring up at something on the wall. There was a body in the house. I quickly skimmed every inch of visible space and peered around the corner into the kitchen, ensuring that there was only one inside. It appeared that that was the case.

'What idiot left the door unlocked?' I panicked in my head.

I jumped violently as I looked back to the entryway to see the figure now standing in the dining room, looking at me. I held my breath, waiting for whatever they were about to do. Since our arrival, this had been the first time that anyone had ever been this close to one of them. If I was fast enough, I could probably make it back to the room before it got to me, but then the front door was still open, and nothing was stopping more from coming inside. As I weighed my options, the body spoke.

"Joel? Is that you?" It called out in a quiet, sing-songy voice.

The voice was familiar, one I had only heard a few times, and long ago at that. It was Hillary. I didn't respond, just looked on in shock. There was still time to run, I told myself, but whether it be morbid curiosity, or the fact that she didn't yet seem hostile, I stayed standing where I was. She spoke again.

"Hi, Honey! It's so lovely to see you! I've missed you all so much! It gets really lonely outside, even with all the friends I have."

Her voice sounded genuinely happy to see me, even though the woman I had only known for about thirty minutes before her death certainly didn't think of me often. Her last sentence was real too. Genuine longing for company.

"Well, are you gonna' come say 'hi' or what?" She giggled, "I don't bite!"

I looked off to the bedroom door and then over my shoulder to the kitchen. To one side, there was only more pain; the other was a fate like those before me. A fate that I wanted for myself. Maybe that's why I didn't care how I achieved that fate, and perhaps that's why I stepped closer to her.

As soon as I got close enough, she lunged out toward me. I expected it to be the last thing I ever saw, but instead, she threw her arms around me and began to sway in place with joy. Her skin was cold, borderline freezing, but the embrace was warm and kind. I knew I should be terrified, but I felt comforted for some strange reason. She pulled away but slid her hands along my arms on the way back, then laced her fingers into mine, excitedly leading me into the sunroom. I followed without resistance. Once we stood before the open doorway, she pointed to the memorial above the door, the one we had made for her.

"Aw, honey, that is so sweet of you all! I'm flattered, really, but I'm afraid you've got it all wrong!"

"What do you mean?" I asked.

"You don't need to remember me, Joel! I'm right here, see?" She twirled in place and beamed with a bright smile. Strangely, her face no longer looked like it did the day she had died. It was pale and certainly long dead, yet her smile had life. Her features were no longer twisted and warped; they were beautiful and even. She looked hauntingly magical.

"You're dead, Hillary," I told her plainly.

A look of sympathetic concern spread across her face, "Oh, honey, no! Not at all! I'm alive! More alive than I've ever been! I feel so incredible!" She noticed my look of pure indifference and made a pout, "Oh Joel, what's wrong? What were you doing out here so late anyway?" she glanced off toward the kitchen and then back to me, putting a hand to her mouth in disbelief. "You weren't going after Andi, were you? I saw her leave a long time ago through the window. You miss her, don't you?"

I nodded, "More than you can imagine."

"Oh, Joel, Honey, that's so dangerous to go down there, though!" She looked off to the hills and pointed. A ballet of corpses skipped and galivanted through the grass beneath the dark sky, occasionally stopping to lock arms with one another and dance around. "I remember when I woke up outside for the first time, I felt so sad. I missed you all just like you missed Andi. But then, I met all of my friends, and they made me feel so happy!" She reached out and took my hands once again. "I can take you to meet them if you'd like! Don't you want to feel happy again, Joel?"

I looked at the fields and then at Hillary. Her eyes were eager and warm, genuinely wanting to help. I knew there was a selfish desire for my presence behind them as well, but I didn't care. I had never noticed how beautiful the hills were at night.

"Sure." I told her, "Let's go."

She squealed with excitement then squeezed my hand, pulling me out through the doorway. She released me and then hopped down the porch stairs, turning back to me at the bottom.

"C'mon, Joel! They're going to love you!"

I nodded, but before I followed, I locked the door from the inside then shut it. I didn't want any more getting in.

Hillary looked at me and frowned, "Aw, Joel, that's no fun… That's okay, though! I'm so happy to have you!" She held out her hand once again, and I stepped down to her and took it. She began skipping as I followed alongside her into the hills and toward the twisting figures in the distance.

 

The corridor we had chosen to go down was a long one, taking us nearly ten minutes total to walk. Once we finally came to the end of it, a simple metal door with a push bar was waiting. I stepped forward and threw it open, however, we immediately had second thoughts when we saw what waited on the other side.

My first impressions gave me flashbacks to Daniel's room; Overly large, concrete, and cavernous. Above and below us was darkness, and only two walls were visible, the one on our side and the one holding a door opposite. Between both doors was another catwalk, but instead of water below, there was nothing but the unforgiving darkness of the unknown. Lights hung from the wall overtop of the doors, and to our left and right, there was nothing but blackness running almost endlessly off into the distance. We all looked from the doorway, but none of us dared to step in.

"Yeah, I'm thinking it's a pass on this one, guys," Ethan said.

I nodded. "Yeah, I think you're right."

"I don't know if we're going to have another option," Bea whispered, pointing back down the hall behind us.

We all looked to see what she was talking about. It was hard to make out through the distance and dim lights, but it was visible. A figure was making its way toward us, and from the look of its size and shape, it was our old friend, the Curator. It had been a while since we had last run into the thing, but it always seemed to know the worst possible times to show up. On the plus side, the lack of screaming and running coming from it meant that it probably hadn't seen us yet. We all looked at one another with worried expressions, and before anyone could decide anything, Bea slipped past us and into the room. Ethan and I followed suit and then silently shut the door.

I turned to the others, "Let's move quickly before it catches up."

Ethan sighed, looking down, "I'm getting really tired of catwalks."

We started across the grated bridge, making sure to keep our eyes up. The only thing holding the platform in place was several wires that ran up toward an unknown ceiling, and considering we had already had one walk break on us in our time here, we didn't want to think about another. I led the charge first, flashlight out and holding it to the floor. The door lights didn't reach the center of the catwalk, and I didn't want anyone to trip in the darkness. Our steps against the metal echoed into the abyss around us, filling the space with a rhythmic tapping. I tried to focus on that instead of the thought of falling or the thing from downstairs barging through the door behind us. It was that focus, however, that alerted me to a noise up ahead.

*Creak…*

My heart jumped into my throat, and the three of us instantly grabbed onto the railings tightly, preparing for the worst. After a moment, however, nothing happened, and I let out the breath I was holding captive in my lungs. It was a sigh relieved much too early.

"Oh, come now, there's no need to panic, you three. This house is indestructible, remember?"

My hand shot up, aiming the flashlight at the voice ahead of us. It was Him. *It*. The thing that haunted us. It stood there looking like someone I had once known and loved, but whose image had become a sight of torment.

"Well, almost always indestructible. Isn't that right, Ethan?" He looked past me and toward Ethan with a blank smile. Behind the poor façade of happiness was a sense of strange anger and malice. I quickly glanced over my shoulder to my friends, hoping they would ask me what was wrong and why I had stopped, but unfortunately, this was no longer in my head. This was real. Bea and Ethan's looks of concern made that clear.

"Um, d-do I know you?" Ethan cautiously asked, as if afraid of the answer.

"Ha. No. You don't know me. But Joel and Bea sure do. Isn't that right, you two?" He snickered. "Oh, I'm sorry, Beatrice, you may not recognize me. Maybe this will help."

Before our eyes, the thing before us quickly jerked its body, twisting its limbs in impossible ways. The movement should have undoubtedly made noise, bones snapping, and flesh shifting, yet it was completely silent. In an instant, its skin rotted off, turning white and lifeless before dissolving into a carpet of mold. In reverse, flesh reemerged, although this time, it looked different. Its joints settled back into place, and now before us stood a girl. She had tired, broken eyes and a pale face. Nothing about her features looked familiar except for her wavy hair. It looked just like Bea's. The whole transformation took only a few seconds, yet having to see every horrific detail made it feel like a lifetime.

"Bea?" The girl said with a soul-crushing look of despair, "You aren't going to leave me again, are you?"

I heard Bea's breathing become heavy behind me. The creature dropped the act and began to cackle wildly at its sick joke.

I had had enough, "What do you want?" I snapped, stepping forward.

"There's no need for hostility, Joel. In fact, I just wanted to come congratulate you."

I didn't respond. I knew it would continue regardless. It just wanted a reaction.

"You figured it out, Joel! You solved the mystery! I'm not just in your pathetic mind. It certainly took you long enough, but hey, better late than never." The thing taking the form of Bea's sister clapped its hands rapidly and violently like it didn't understand the motion. It was genuinely unnerving how well it could act human when it came to tormenting us, but talking off-script seemed hard for it. "And that's not the only thing. You also dodged the trap I had worked so hard to set. I suppose that's a good thing for you, though. That trail led straight into your room, Joel." It grinned sinisterly. Widely. Far too wide.

"Sorry to disappoint," I said through a clenched jaw. Rage was building inside of me. I felt no more fear toward this creature, knowing what I now did. Everything it had ever done to me was counting off in my head, and as the list grew, so did my desire to strike the smug look from its face. I didn't care if it was a monster. I was to the point where I could probably take on the Curator with how fed up I was.

However, all of that confidence crashed to the floor in an instant at its following words.

"That's alright. I thought you might figure it out. That's why I put Bea's room at the end of the other hall. The one you just came down?"

Everything froze while we processed what was just said. I turned to Bea, who just looked straight ahead at her sister, glassy-eyed and shocked. Behind her, Ethan looked at me with desperation. I spun back at the shapeshifter whose gleeful expression hadn't changed.

"At least it's not yours, though."

That was what made me snap. I ran forward like a feral animal, swinging my flashlight hard at its skull. It connected with a loud crack! that echoed through the darkness. However, instead of shattering its head, the blow shattered the object itself into several metallic pieces that exploded into the air around us. Shock held me in place for a moment as I stared at the unflinching figure. It smiled somehow even wider, and its face began to sag and wrinkle as it blinked its eyes and revealed new ones underneath. Yellow eyeballs with small black pupils. I suddenly felt very foolish for thinking I had any control.

In a flash, it shot its hand out and grabbed my arm, and with its other, it wrapped its fingers around my shoulder. I watched the digits grow and extend like tree branches, coiling under my armpit and rejoining into its own wrist. I grabbed at its limb and struggled to resist, but it just cocked its head to the side innocently before the ropey tendrils tightened with impossible strength. My arm made a sickening *Pop*! as radiating agony vibrated through every nerve of my body.

"Joel!" Bea cried behind me, rushing forward and catching me as I slumped onto the railing with my good arm. I looked up to the creature and prepared to duck away from whatever came next, but I only saw its form fall straight through the catwalk and into the darkness. At least, that's what I thought at first...

It had been so quick that I barely saw its feet twist into the catwalk and decompose into mold, sucking the rest of its figure along with it out of sight. Bea and I frantically looked around us, but there was no trace of the thing. Ethan went to run to us, but the railings on either side of the walk quickly jutted inward on both sides of him, locking him in place. He looked down and began to struggle, hopelessly prying at the bars holding his hips. It was no use. Bea stood and went to help him next, but the creature reappeared once again, wrenching itself from the metal frame of the platform, still looking like her sister.

"Don't worry about them, Beatrice. They'll be okay, at least for now. As for you, your room is waiting."

Bea took a few steps back toward me, then turned around with an expression of panic. The adrenaline forced me back onto my feet as I clutched my dangling arm. I staggered forward to help, but I was too late.

I watched as another part of the railing broke loose and snapped inward, impaling Bea straight through the stomach.

The combination of pain and the sight before me brought me back to the floor. I looked on in horror as Bea's panic turned into shock. She looked down and very gently brushed her fingers against the bloody metal rod sticking through her. I wanted to cry out for her, but no air would come to me. My heart ached at the sheer pain in her eyes as she desperately looked to me for help. I heard Ethan screaming behind us, but it was blurred and distant. I crawled forward and forced myself onto my knees, grabbing hold of her waist. I didn't know how but I was going to fix this. I had to fix this. I tried yanking on the rod but to no avail.

"Please, please, please…." I muttered over and over. Time was sluggish and felt like tar, encasing everything and suffocating us alive. I suddenly felt a hand on my cheek as Bea guided my gaze to her face.

"J-Joel…"

The catwalk below her suddenly folded inward, exposing the darkness below us. The bar that held her in place snapped downward, allowing her to slide painfully from its grasp. As she fell, my arm shot out to catch her hand. The one that had held me seconds ago. I looked down at her with pleading eyes as she dangled above the abyss. I wasn't going to make the same mistake I had made with Daniel. I wasn't about to let go. Unfortunately, Bea wasn't holding on, and I had only managed to catch her blood-soaked fingers.

"F-find the… I'm… So sorry…"

I felt every painful inch of her hand slip slowly out of my fingers, then watched as she fell into darkness.

At that, the ability to make sound came back to me, and I used it. I screamed louder than I ever had in my entire life. I yelled and cursed and called out into the darkness for her, but I knew that I wasn't going to hear anything back. Ethan cried out alongside me and began to weep as he collapsed against the bars that held him. All the while, while we screamed and sobbed, the thing that had just killed our friend stood, simply observing our grief. After a moment, the catwalk repaired itself where Bea had fallen, and then It spoke.

"I can't believe you're so upset, Joel. You've been through this before. Several times, in fact. You'd think you would be used to losing girls you loved by now. Or did you even really love her?"

"I hate you…." I whispered, unable to make enough sound for spite. The sadness had taken all of it away from me. "I hate you so fucking much."

"I know you do. Don't worry, though; your room is coming soon. Then you won't have to worry anymore."

I felt a chill run down my spine, and with that, the thing that haunted us disappeared into the ground leaving us alone with our pain and agony.
