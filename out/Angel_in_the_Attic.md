At dinner my sister Lindsey excitedly told us about the angel in the attic. We grew up in a religious family so it wasn’t too weird that her imaginary friend would be of the biblical variety. She was eight at the time, making me fifteen. Five years ago. We were at my mom’s sister’s, Aunt Margaret, visiting for the summer. Aunt Margaret’s house might be considered a mansion by some. Rooms upon rooms, three stories tall. Entering through the main door you’re greeted with a wide, curving staircase that leads to the second floor which holds six bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a sun room. Behind the stair case, the main floor, a kitchen, two sitting rooms, a game room, dining room, and yet another sun room. The third floor, accessed by a tight, almost vertical staircase, was basically just the attic. One expansive open room above the rest of the house. 

Lindsey had been spending her days exploring the house, her favorite room being the attic. 

At dinner though, I remember her saying

“I thought angels were supposed to be pretty.”

And Mom replied, “Do you remember Zechariah? He was terrified when he saw an Angel.”

My sister nodded knowingly at that, “It was very scary at first. But only for a little bit.”

Mom and Aunt Margaret smiled at her, but I thought it was so odd. Why would a kid purposely make up scary things? 

The next day she disappeared again to explore. We didn’t think much of it until it was dinner and she still hadn’t turned up. We began looking through the rooms, calling out for her. Eventually we ended up at the attic stairs and there she was, curled up at the bottom silently crying. Mom swept her up and brought her downstairs where we tried everything we could to console her. She calmed down, but still wouldn’t tell us what happened. She wouldn’t tell us anything, she couldn’t, I guess. For the past five years she hasn’t spoken a word. 

There have been so many doctors and therapists, appointment after appointment, never leading to any answers. No one could give us an actual reason for this. And Lindsey wouldn’t explain either, not in writing anyways. I’m not sure she even knew why she couldn’t talk. The three of us made an unspoken agreement to never return to Aunt Margaret’s, though. 

Until Aunt Margaret died last week and Mom somehow ended up being the one in charge of her estate. So back we went, just Mom and I, Lindsey refused to go and who could blame her. 

The house felt so heavy when we arrived. My aunt had started staying on the main floor, so only a few rooms had seen any life. Everywhere else covered in dust, all the curtains tightly closed. We thought it’d be easier to share a room so we found the cleanest one and got it ready. Fresh sheets and an open window instantly improved the conditions so you almost forgot about the musty and oppressive state of the rest of the house. Exhausted from traveling, we both slept hard that night. 

In the light of a new day we found ourselves emboldened and ended up at the attic steps. We stood there for a few minutes, Mom looking up the staircase, me watching her. We could be here all day, so I went around her and began going up. She followed closely behind me. The stairs creaked with each footfall, moaning under our weight, warning us. As we crested the top we could see there was nothing except boxes and old furniture covered in more dust than the downstairs. A few boarded up windows provided enough light to see and walked through, not really sure what we were looking for. A box of old books, my grandmother’s dresser, someone’s coin collection. A mix of feeling at ease and disappointed. We still couldn’t find an explanation for my sister’s condition. There was nothing worthwhile. 

We decided to go back down and start on the main floor, sorting Aunt Margaret’s belongings into keep or donate boxes. I was distracted, there was something about the attic, something up there that had answers, and I needed to find it. I waited until Mom fell asleep that night before trying to go back. I slipped out of bed and made my way through the winding halls. I had my phone’s light, but it only uncovered a few steps ahead of me. At the staircase I paused, looking up the narrow corridor. There was some other light on up there, illuminating the top of the stairs and the landing. 

With each step I took I felt calmer, more sure of myself, and as I stepped into the glow a warm feeling washed over me. It was so comforting. I saw a figure in front of one of the windows halfway across the room. The light seemed to be emanating out from them. I was alarmed, someone had broken in, but that feeling quickly subsided and gave way to peace. No, they were supposed to be here and it was okay. My body began moving on its own toward the figure, I wasn’t in control but I didn’t care. 

Its back was to me and as I drew closer I could see through the glow. A gray robe draped over it, the sleeves as long as the bottom brushing against the floor. They turned to me then, the hood cascading around their face like hair, the robe swishing fluidly like it was more than clothes, like it was part of them. The face, oh the face, like a blank canvas the same pale gray stretched thin over a long and narrow frame. The piece of me still conscious wanted to scream, but my legs kept moving forward, my arms reaching out. The figure opened its own arms, embracing me, folding me into the fabric of itself, swallowing me. I welcomed it. A warmth spread throughout my body and I let myself sink in. I’d never felt so safe, so happy, so loved. But as my limbs grew lighter, like I was floating, the warmth turned to burning. I couldn’t feel anything except heat and my lungs constricting and somehow I pushed myself back into my body, back in control. I tore myself free from its grasp and stumbled backwards. I was previously floating and now it was like I had been slammed into the ground. I was clumsy and struggling to make myself move how I wanted. Every step, every breath hurt, and my vision was blacking out. I thought I was at the stairs and I reached out to grab the wall but there was nothing except air. I lost my balance and began falling for real, crashing down the stairs and landing hard on my back. Then darkness and floating again. 

When I woke back up Mom was standing over me, stroking my hair. I realized we were in the hospital. When she saw my eyes open she cried out and tears began falling down her face, landing on my own. I tried saying something, I wanted to ask what was happening, but my throat tightened. Nothing came out. I couldn’t speak.
