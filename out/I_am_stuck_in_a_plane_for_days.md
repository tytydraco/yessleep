I was on a usual work trip in NY and when it came to an end I was in the airport, waiting for my flight back to Los Angeles. I went inside the plane, we took off and i was too tired to stay awake, so I fell asleep. I woke up a few hours later, and to my surprise, outside was... Water. Not a lake, but a darn ocean! I looked around to see napkins on my table with the American Airlines logo on them. This made me shiver. I booked a Delta airlines flight. I checked my phone. 4:03, 10th of October. I watched the screen for a good 5 minutes. No change. The time stayed at 4:03 am. When I looked up to look for flight attendants, i froze. They had a smile ear to ear... And tear streaming down their cheeks. What the... I still talked to a female flight attendant.

Me: "Excuse me, why are we flying above an ocean?"

The flight attendant wiped off the tears and answered:

FA: "Do not worry sir, we will land in an hour." 

The woman's voice was perfect, like nothing happened.

Okay... That's weird. To say the least. I came up to an elderly passenger, who was sitting a row next to mine, and talked to her.

Me: "Excuse me, ma'am."

She turned to me with an irritated look.

Elderly woman: "Yes?

Me: "Do you know why are we flying above an ocean"

Elderly woman: "We are landing in an hour."

Suddenly, an iron grip held my shoulder. I turned to see the same flight attendant, smile ear to ear and tears.

FA: "Sir, please return to your place. We will land in an 
hour." 

I went back. When i was walking to my seat, a businesswoman came from the first class. She didn't pay attention to me nor did she slow down, but right next to my seat she dropped a paper and went to the bathroom in the tail. I picked up the paper and read a note: "Are you also stuck here?" Such a relief and a shock at the same time. I took a pen and wrote "yes" and threw the paper back. The woman came out of the bathroom and picked it up. An hour later, we didn't land. However the woman came up to me and took a seat next to me.

Woman: "Any ideas about what's happening?" 

Me: "This feels like a nightmare i can't wake up from. 

Woman: "That can be true. Name's Mary, by the way."

Me: "Tim."

Our voices were barely above a whisper as we discussed the events, knowing that whatever those things are, they won't be happy if the find out about us.

Then, a voice on speaker filled the plane. "Ladies and gentlemen, we are happy to announce that you may now talk to the captain." Then, flight attendants came up to us and asked me whether do i want to talk to the captain. At that moment I saw a black figure at least 8 feet tall. I refused. It was around 30 hours since i woke up.

The very next moment, the lights turned red, like emergency lights or like in a horror movie. Not only that, a very strong smell of sulfur appeared. Weird enough that the elderly woman didn't react and just kept watching the movie on the screen. 

Me: "Don't cough." 

We tried our best, but it was too bad. We started coughing like we were about to spit out our lungs. The figure... Pointed to us. Whatever that was... It's not human. The flight attendants turned to us. Their faces remained the same. Grin year to year and... Tears? What the... They are... Red? Its hard to tell with the red lightning, but they did not look transparent. They started approaching us. The black figure... Was pointing to us. 

Me: "RUN." 

We ran to the bathrooms and hopped into different rooms. I put my legs on the metal door to keep it closed. The flight attendant, or whatever that creature was, tried to open the door, while i tried to keep them closed. On an adrenaline rush, I managed to keep the door closed. However, Mary... I heard clenching sounds, like metal was cracking. They got her. Next moment i heard the loudest scream ever. I could never forget the horror and desperation that was in this scream. She yelled, begged for mercy, for salvation, for me to save her... But I didn't. I was frozen in horror I probably won't forgive myself for that. Then... It went silent. 

3 weeks since i woke up. I've been in this toilet for weeks. I finally came out. The light was back to normal. The tears of the flight attendants were transparent. They still had bloodstains on their uniform.

1 month after waking up. I am going crazy. The food is good. But I'm losing myself. Mary turned out to become an NPC-like person just like the elderly woman in front of me. I'm now alone. Again. The WiFi malfunctioned. I've watched the same movies hundreds of times. I broke my phone. Enough. I ran to the emergency exit. I knew that it wouldn't open, but nothing is normal here. The door opened and i jumped out The sea was getting closer 

Me: "No... No! I want to live!" 

 Useless, of course. A minute later I fell into the sea.

Me: "NOOOO!"

I snapped back to reality when i hit the front seat with my head. Outside the window i saw lights of cities. No one really heard me except the flight attendant, as half of the plane seats were empty. A flight attendant ran to me, concerned. There were to grin ear to ear nor tears on her face, just a mixed expression of concern and confusion.

FA: "Sir? Can I help you? Are you okay"

Me: "Sorry... I've got a panic attack after a nightmare. Im alright now.

FA: "Don't worry sir, we are landing in an hour. 

The phrase i hated. But after an hour or so we actually landed. I am never flying a plane ever again. And God i hope the bartender is just smiling widely.
