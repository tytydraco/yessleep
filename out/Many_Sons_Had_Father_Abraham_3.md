I’d been at least expecting the ‘downtown’ area of Smokey Falls to be charming. From what little I’d seen of it as we’d driven in a few days prior, it had looked like one of those quaint little main streets you see in a lot of country towns, with old buildings hosting both locally owned stores and familiar brand names in a fascinating mixture of the Familiar and the Obscure. There’s something both unmistakably urban and yet simultaneously rural about towns like that. It’s hard to pin down exactly why I love them so much, but I do love them.

&#x200B;

Much to my disappointment though, the downtown area of Smokey Falls wasn’t much to write home about at all. In fact, most of the buildings seemed to be completely abandoned and the ones that weren’t only hosted small stores that barely even looked open. Beyond them, there was next to nothing save for empty highway and farmland stretching into the distance as far as the eye could see. The whole area had something of a desolate quality to it. Like a ghost town.

&#x200B;

I’d headed downtown during my lunch break to pick up some paint from the hardware store. Joel and Patrick were supposed to be redoing the shed that weekend and I’d sorta volunteered myself to help.

&#x200B;

It had been three days since my ill advised visit to the Church and those past few days had slipped by rather uneventfully. Joel had said nothing about the ‘Prayer Circle’ to me and I’d kept quiet about my little visit to it in turn. I didn’t mention the blinding light I’d see shining from the Church that night, or how Briar had come in to drag me away from it all the way that she did. 

&#x200B;

Frankly, the past few days had almost seemed… Normal. Refreshingly so. Although that little lapse into normalcy didn’t really do much to quell my nerves. My encounter with Minnie a few nights ago, what I’d seen at the church, and Briar’s strange behavior all lingered in the back of my mind. 

&#x200B;

There were no other cars downtown when I arrived there, so I was able to park right in front of the hardware store. 

&#x200B;

I got out of the car and headed inside. It looked like the place was a few days away from closing down. An old man who seemed only half awake sat behind the counter and didn’t even move his head to acknowledge me when I walked in. I didn’t bother talking to him and just quietly made my way over to the paint section. The shed was currently a faded red color and I figured that Patrick was probably going to want to keep it consistent. I had some wood chips off the original shed to help me pick out the color and compared them against the shades that the store had on offer, taking my time and humming to myself as I debated which shade might look better. At one point, I vaguely heard the front door chime as someone else came in, but didn’t really bother looking up to see who’d joined me. That might’ve been a mistake.

&#x200B;

  “I know that song…” A voice said beside me, and I felt a chill run through me as I recognized the speaker.

I turned around suddenly to see Father Abraham waiting a few feet away from me, a knowing smile on his lips and his hands jammed into his pockets.

  “W-what song?” I asked, almost defensively.

&#x200B;

  “One of the girls likes to sing it with the kids at Sunday School… It’s sort of a little joke on her part, I think. *‘Father Abraham, had many sons. Many sons had Father Abraham…’*” His gentle singing faded away into a playful humming, before finally breaking down into laughter. When he hummed it, I recognized the tune. It’d been the mindless tune that I’d just been humming to myself. The lyrics of the song echoed through my mind as a vivid memory of the Church from a few nights ago came rushing back to me. That song, playing on the radio.

&#x200B;

  “I’m not sure if it’s just a strange coincidence, or if the Lord has a sense of humor.” Father Abraham said, “Perhaps both…”

  “Maybe…” I said, offering a sheepish smile. 

  “You look like you’re looking for something. Do you need any help?” Father Abraham asked, before looking back at the man behind the counter, “Between you and me, old Lyle’s not the best with customers…” He whispered, before chuckling.

&#x200B;

 “Oh! I’m fine!” I insisted, “Just picking out a shade. Y’know. Fussing over the little details.”

  “Well, it’s the little details that are sometimes the most important, aren’t they?” Father Abraham asked, “And Patrick tends to be particular. Too particular at times, I think. But I do appreciate his eye for detail…” 

&#x200B;

He studied the shades I’d picked out before gently reaching out and tapping one of them.

  “That one. They used that when they painted the shed the first time.”

  “You remember it?” I asked.

  “Oh, I was the one buying the paint.” Father Abraham said with a chuckle, “I remember, Patrick was about fourteen at the time. He and Joel’s father had passed about a year prior so he had it in his head that he ought to be the man of the house. I’d caught him and Joel walking along the highway to buy paint one day and I’d offered them a ride. Course, that eventually turned into helping them with the shed… To Patrick’s credit, he’d done a darn fine job building it himself. I told him as much too. Spent the afternoon with those boys painting that shed, then Shannon invited us in for sweet tea.”

&#x200B;

  “Sounds like a nice afternoon,” I said.

  “It was…” Father Abraham replied, a faint smile crossing his lips, “I remember watching him work though. He was meticulous. I always liked that about him. Can’t get nothin’ by him… Which reminds me… He noticed some interesting tire tracks out by the Church the other day…”

&#x200B;

I paused, feeling my heart skip a beat slightly. Father Abraham was still smiling.

  “Aw, you don’t need to worry about a thing, Danielle. I figure you were just checking in on your husband. I can respect that. You’re new in town. Don’t quite know how things work yet. You’ll figure it all out in time. A couple of years from now, you might as well be a local.”

  “I was actually just going to bring some snacks…” I said. Somehow, that felt like a lie even if it wasn’t.

  “Were you? How nice. Maybe next time, you can send them along with Joel. Save yourself the upset stomach.” Father Abraham chuckled, “I imagine that whatever you saw out there must’ve given you quite the fright, didn’t it?”

&#x200B;

I was quiet for a moment, before deciding that I had nothing to lose by asking.

  “And what exactly was it that I saw out there the other night?” I asked.

  “Nothing sinister, if that’s what you’re wondering.” Father Abraham replied, “These prayer circles are more for healing than anything else. See, I’m a preacher second. Honestly, I figure someone else would do better speaking the Word of God than I would… What I’m on this earth to do, is to heal. Heal people, heal the world around us. That’s my mission.”

&#x200B;

  “People like Minnie?” I asked. He nodded.

  “People like Minnie.” He said, “It’s a process… Takes time and these kinds of sermons are better carried out in private. Easier to handle things that way.”

  “So what about people like Shannon?” I asked, “You ever tried healing her?”

&#x200B;

Father Abraham let out a gentle, almost melancholy laugh.

  “Well, I think you might’ve noticed that her condition is a little more physical than spiritual. I don’t claim to be anything I’m not. The Lord has a plan for each of us. I’ve done all I can for Shannon, as have the good folks down at the hospital. Her fate is in His hands now. Nobody elses.”

  “So what exactly do you do then?” I asked, sounding a little more confrontational than I probably meant to. Although if he was offended by my tone, Father Abraham certainly didn’t show it.

&#x200B;

  “Maybe in time, you’ll see for yourself.” He said, “Ah, but I should let you go now… It was nice talking to you again, Danielle… And I’m looking forward to see what you send along with your husband to this weekends prayer circle. Joel tells us you’re quite the cook.”

He patted me on the shoulder and with that, he was gone again. I watched him wander towards the back of the store where he browsed some shelving brackets. I almost felt like I needed to say more to him… But what would I even say? I left him alone, took the shade Father Abraham had picked out for me to the clerk, and checked out.

&#x200B;

There was a certain… Emptiness, during the next few days. It’s hard to really describe it. Ennui might be the right word, but I’m not entirely sure. It was like waiting for something to happen, although that something never came.

&#x200B;

Every day I woke up with Joel. We had breakfast with the family. Briar and I usually cooked it. Joel and I would then head to our office upstairs to work, the way we had back before we’d left Philadelphia. 

&#x200B;

The days drifted by almost aimlessly. They felt purposeless and empty. I never talked to Briar about what I’d seen on Sunday. But every time we saw each other, whether we were alone in the kitchen cooking together, or just sitting in the living room watching TV, I couldn’t help but look at her and wonder what she knew that I didn’t. 

&#x200B;

Patrick and Joel painted the shed that Saturday. I offered to help, but Patrick had just laughed and said it was: “Boys work.” 

&#x200B;

Come Sunday, it was time for Church again and when I woke up that morning, I found the dress Joel had picked for me on the bed. I didn’t put it on. I wore something else just to see what he’d say and when I came downstairs in something else. I picked a blouse that was still nice and a matching skirt. This wasn’t really the sort of outfit that would make waves anywhere. I’d worn it before and Joel had liked it just fine. I’m not really sure what I expected to happen… Nothing, I suppose. 

&#x200B;

Nothing I’d hoped. 

&#x200B;

I came downstairs to breakfast and noticed both Patrick and Joel looking up at me as I walked into the kitchen. Joel smiled at me, but it seemed more hollow than anything else. There was an unusual coldness in his eyes… He almost looked angry… 

&#x200B;

And Patrick. I couldn’t read Patricks expression. He stared at me with a half smile that didn’t seem to have any joy in it. Like with Joel, it didn’t reach his eyes. He almost seemed angry… 

  “Dani… You look nice.” Joel said softly although his tone wasn’t quite right. The words seemed hollow.

  “Thank you.” I said quietly before grabbing a seat at the table beside my husband. He kept staring at me, his smile slowly fading as he did. 

&#x200B;

Breakfast was pancakes, sausage, and gravy. I piled a helping onto my plate and dug in. 

  “This is great Briar, thank you.” I said.

Briar looked over at me, giving me a brief nod. Her own expression was faraway, almost vacant as if her mind was off someplace else. Joel still had some food on his plate, but he reached over to grab another helping of pancakes anyways. He probably should’ve asked Patrick or Shannon to hand it to him, but he reached for it anyways and as he did, his arm knocked over the pitcher of syrup on the table, spilling it onto my blouse.

&#x200B;

  “Oh, shoot! Dani, I’m sorry!” He said, although I could tell from his tone that he was putting on an act. He grabbed a napkin and tried to help me clean the syrup off my blouse, although it didn’t really help.

  “Shoot, are you alright?” He asked.

I looked up at him, unsure of what to say. I wasn’t stupid. He’d been trying to make it look like an accident. But he’d spilled that syrup on my shirt intentionally. It wasn’t an accident.

&#x200B;

  “You’d better go change.” He said, “You can’t go to Church with that stain! I’m so sorry!”

  “It’s fine…” I lied before getting up and heading back upstairs. I still didn’t put on the fucking dress he’d picked out for me. There was no way in hell I was wearing that! When I came back downstairs, I could see a quiet frustration cross Joel’s face. I noticed Patrick giving him a look, but neither of them said anything. I didn’t have time to finish my breakfast after that little fiasco. Church was waiting.

&#x200B;

My second mass at St. John The Baptist, Fontanist Church wasn’t all that different from the first one. After mingling in the lobby for a bit, we went into the chapel and sat near the front. Just like last week, Father Abraham gave his sermon. A rambling speech about the decline of America that seemed more and more unhinged the more I listened.

&#x200B;

  “America is not dying.” He said, speaking with a gravity that seemed a little unearned, “It is already dead. It died the moment it chose mob rule, over the rule of divinity. We have fallen, brothers and sisters into a cesspit of degeneracy… A cesspit from which the world we know cannot climb out of. There is no point of return. Not for the world. But for we the people… We can still be saved. Salvation is not for all. Salvation is not unconditional. Salvation is a choice we make every second of every day as we stand above the sinful influence of this world. This world… Which lists like a sinking ship… Tell me, brothers and sisters, if you were on a sinking ship and you had a lifeboat, would it be your duty to spare others? Would saving as many as you can be your moral obligation?”

  “*Yes*.” Came the reply from the congregation and Father Abraham gave a gentle nod.

&#x200B;

  “Yes…” He repeated, “And so, this remains our mission. To save as many as we can. To spread the true word of the Lord so that when His wrath comes. When the Sin is purged and Society is born again, as many righteous souls as possible remain. But it is an uphill struggle, my friends. It is. It always has been… In the days of Rome, Christians were slaughtered for their faith. The persecution may not be as clear today but I assure you it is *worse*. Look out into the world. To say one hates God, and to worship pagan idols is normal. It is rising again. They scream to be accepted. They march and they rally and they spread their satanic influence inch by inch… It is becoming accepted to be a pagan these days. But to simply state ones belief that we live as God intended… Well, suddenly you’re a monster in the eyes of the world. Suddenly you’re a backwards savage. It is objectively harder to be a Christian in America than it is to be anything else. This is the truth.”

&#x200B;

  “Amen!” I came the cries from the congregation, and among them I heard Joel’s voice. Looking over at him, I saw his eyes completely fixated on Father Abraham. He sat at rapt attention, hanging on to his every word…

&#x200B;

After the sermon came the same cheese and crackers social that we’d had last week. I’d called it a lunch before although there really wasn’t that much to it. Father Abraham mingled just like he had last week, but never really spoke to me. Then he gave some brief announcements regarding the church's weekly calendar. That night there would be veterans meeting in the basement from 4 to 5:30, followed by the usual prayer circle at 6. During the week, there would be Bible study. Stuff like that. Outside of his mention of the prayer circle, none of it sounded all that interesting.

&#x200B;

We didn’t stay long after the announcements. Patrick dropped Briar, Shannon and I off at the house after Church. He said he and Joel were going over to Smokey Oak to do some work before they went back to the Church for the evening prayer circle. They wouldn’t be back until evening.

&#x200B;

I killed my afternoon in the office, attempting to chip away at some of my work. I could hear Shannon downstairs watching TV while Briar went outside to tend the garden. Normally I’d say that a quiet afternoon was exactly what I needed… Although being alone with my thoughts really didn’t do me any favors and work wasn’t much of a distraction. After thirty minutes of dicking around with one of my projects, I closed my laptop, put on some jeans, and went outside to help Briar with the gardening.

&#x200B;

She was out in the backyard, tending to the tomato crop when I found her. She didn’t seem to acknowledge me as I approached.

  “Need any help?” I asked. She paused, before gesturing to the far side of the soil patch.

  “You could start with the weeding on that side. There’s a spare pair of gloves in the shed.”

&#x200B;

I went to get them, headed over to the other side of the garden and started pulling the weeds.

  “Thought you were working upstairs this afternoon?” Briar said.

  “Couldn’t get into it.” I replied, “Too much on my mind, I guess.”

She paused again, a slight grimace appearing on her face. She looked back towards the house before asking:

  “Where’s Mom?”

&#x200B;

  “On the couch. Hooked up to her oxygen and asleep.” I replied.

  “Figured. Church takes a lot out of her… I reckon that’s why you think now’s the time to ask your questions, right?”

  “Maybe.” I admitted, “Is there something wrong with that?”

  “Honey, you gotta learn that there’s never a good time in Smokey Falls for questions.” Briar said, “The writing on the wall is blood crimson. I know you’ve seen it. Frankly… I’m surprised you’ve stuck around as long as you have.”

&#x200B;

  “Why would that surprise you?” I asked.

Briar scoffed.

  “That stunt this morning. You’re not dumb. You know this place ain’t right… You’ve seen it in the way Joel acts, I’ll bet.”

I was quiet for a moment before giving a slight nod.

&#x200B;

  “He’s been… Different, since we came here… Sure.”

  “What was he like back in the city?” She asked, “Quiet I’ll bet. Never talked too much about where he came from. Always something of a yes man, right?”

  “A little bit…” I admitted, “But he was sweet. He always tried to accommodate people. He was kind. I liked that about him.”

&#x200B;

  “Fancy way of calling him a pushover.” Briar replied, “Joel’s always been… Well. He does what other folks tell him to do. Especially Patrick. I’ve seen the change myself over the past few days. He talks less, did you notice that? And wherever Patrick goes, he goes. Used to be that way when we were kids. After our Dad died, Patrick sorta took over that role, and Joel… Joel always looked up to him like he was all that…”

  “What’s wrong with him looking up to his brother?” I asked.

&#x200B;

  “You know damn well what’s wrong with it.” Briar said, “Patricks been pretty good about keeping quiet around you… But give it time, that’ll change. It’ll be small at first. But slowly he’ll seep into every little pore of your life and he’ll do it through Joel. The outfits he leaves out for you every Sunday morning for instance… Little things like that.”

  “You’re making it sound like Patricks controlling Joel.” I said.

Briar stopped her weeding and looked up at me, sitting down on the ground.

&#x200B;

  “Y’know I ain’t sure if you’re playing dumb or if you actually are dumb.” She said, “Of course Patricks controlling Joel. It’s what he does. And Joel’s such a goddamn pussy he’ll let him do it, and I don’t think that boy was ever smart enough to realize what was happening.”

  “You don’t need to talk about Joel that way.” I said.

  “I’m telling you how it is. Your husband might’ve been a decent guy when he was living in Philladelphia. But here in Smokey Falls, your husband does what Patrick says. When Patrick said come home, he came scampering. You saw it all firsthand. You’re smart enough to know it’s happening. Don’t make excuses. Don’t deny the reality of your situation because that is not gonna end well for you.”

&#x200B;

I narrowed my eyes at her.

  “And what exactly is the reality of my situation?” I asked.

  “You’ve seen the Church. You’ve met Father Abraham. You know it’s all a bunch of bullshit… But the people in this town eat it right up. Mom, Patrick, Joel… Minnie’s Dad did too. This entire town…  It’s a cesspool. A miserable, rotten quagmire with slimy things crawling through the mud, waiting for fresh meat to fall in so they can devour it whole. It’s not the kind of place anyone wants to end up, and it sure as hell ain’t the place for you.”

&#x200B;

I stared at her, unsure of what to say. Briar watched me intently, before shaking her head and going back to the weeding.

  “If you’re smart, you’ll be on the highway out of here before Patrick and Joel get home.”

  “I’m not just gonna leave my husband!” I said, “For Christ's sake, Joel and I have been together for three years now, you’re acting like I don’t know him at all!”

  “You don’t.” Briar said matter of factly, “You don’t know the first thing about Joel. And honestly, you don’t want to. Do what you want… See where it gets you. I’ve said my piece.”

&#x200B;

I watched her as she pulled up a few more of the weeds.

  “If this towns so bad, why are you still here then?” I asked.

She paused again and let out a dry, humorless laugh.

  “Unlike you honey, I don’t have a choice.” She said. She sat back on her haunches again and wiped the sweat from her brow.

  “It’s funny… You almost sound like Minnie…” She said, almost wistfully.

  “She wanted to leave too?” I asked.

Briar hesitated for a moment before giving a half nod.

&#x200B;

  “She’d bought herself a bus ticket… Two, actually… Told me I could come with. I tried to warn her. Said it’d never work out. But… She didn’t listen… And you saw how that worked out.”

  “What did they do to Minnie?” I asked. Briar didn’t answer. 

  “What did they do to her?” I asked again.

  “I don’t know.” She replied plainly, “Father Abraham’s little prayer circles are really only open to those he trusts. Not a lot of women in that group. What I do know is that one way or another, Minnie’s gone. That… Thing, you’ve seen wandering through the woods, singing to itself… That ain’t her… Not anymore.”

&#x200B;

She let out a shaky sigh before looking over at me again. There was something in her eyes. A deep pain that I had no hope of understanding.

  “If they’re doing something to people at those prayer circles… If they’re hurting people like Minnie, then we have to tell someone.” I said, “We *need* to tell someone!”

  “Who?” She asked, “Who are you going to tell? And what are you going to tell them?” 

&#x200B;

I opened my mouth to speak again only to fall quiet. She was right… There were no police to call, and even if I left town to find someone else, what would I tell them? I had no idea what was actually going on during these Prayer Circles and I didn’t exactly have any proof of anything either. Just suspicion and fears.

  “If you’re gonna help with the weeding, then help. Help, or fuck off. I don’t care where. Either way, I’m done talking about all of this.” Briar said, her voice heavy with exhaustion. With that, she went back to the weeds and after a few moments, I got down to help her. I had to stay occupied somehow while I waited for dusk. 

&#x200B;

A little before five rolled around, I was in the car heading back towards the church. Shannon was asleep again, having only briefly woken up for dinner and Briar didn’t try to stop me. I really don’t know what I was planning or what I had in mind… Well, that’s not entirely true. I did have somewhat of a plan. I’d brought an old camcorder we’d packed away with me. It had about five hours of battery life on it. My plan was to hide it in the chapel before the prayer circle started and to leave the church before that weird light show began. I could go back and get it again later and if I was lucky, I’d be able to see whatever the hell it was they were doing during those little gatherings of theirs. I didn’t know what I expected to find or to prove… I suppose a small part of me hoped it really would be nothing. That some mundane, trivial explanation would reveal itself and alleviate all of my fears. But I think I already knew that wasn’t going to happen. 

&#x200B;

When I made it to the church, I could see a few other cars outside. Probably part of that veterans meeting Father Abraham had mentioned. I’d figured they’d be there. Because if they were there, then the doors were probably unlocked. The lobby was empty when I walked in, as was the chapel. Father Abraham had said the meeting was being held in the basement. Nobody seemed to notice me during the few minutes it took for me to go into the chapel, plant my camera in the window and leave. 

&#x200B;

During his announcements that morning, Father Abraham had said there would also be a weekly Bible study that Tuesday. I figured that would be the perfect time to slip in and get my camera back, assuming everything went as planned and it hadn’t been discovered. I doubted they’d find it. I’d hidden it up high in a windowsill where it could have a bird's eye view of the chapel without being seen too easily. 

&#x200B;

I was in and out in no time flat and driving home like nothing was wrong. I stopped off in town to pick up some quick groceries to excuse my little trip out in case anyone questioned me when I came home, but nobody said a word to me.

&#x200B;

Shannon was still asleep and Briar was nowhere to be found. I ended up back in my office, chipping away at my work and just as unable to focus on it as I was before. 

&#x200B;

Joel wasn’t back home again until past midnight. I only woke up briefly when he came to bed. Long enough to acknowledge he was there. He spoke to me, but I don’t remember much about what he said other than him apologizing for waking me up. I just rolled over and went back to sleep.

&#x200B;

Monday drifted by in an uneasy haze. My mind was focused on the camera I’d hidden in the chapel. Something told me that if it had been discovered, Patrick probably would’ve said something to me. But I hardly spoke to him that day. He’d left early to go to Smokey Oak and wasn’t back until dinner.

&#x200B;

Tuesday was the moment of truth.

&#x200B;

Like the day before (like most days in Smokey Falls actually) it drifted by in a sort of languorous haze. There was this inescapable sensation of time passing. Slipping away through my fingertips and no matter what I did, it still felt wasted. I worked on my projects, making progress but feeling like I’d gotten nothing done, and shortly after dinner, I excused myself. I don’t really know why I bothered. Briar could’ve cared less where I was, Shannon spent her time either watching TV or sleeping, and Patrick and Joel were rarely ever around.

&#x200B;

In fact, Joel’s routine had shifted in the week since we’d come here. Whenever he wasn’t in the office with me, he was with Patrick, usually at Smokey Oak. Maybe it was all in my head but ever since I’d talked to Briar, I couldn’t help but notice that he really did follow Patrick around like a little puppy… Wherever Patrick went, Joel usually went. In fact, the only time he seemed to spend time home with me was when he was working, and that wasn’t exactly quality time. Normally I would’ve asked him about it or said something… But somehow I already knew how that conversation would go.

  *“Well, yeah. He’s my brother. We haven’t seen each other in a while. I was hoping to spend some time with him, y’know? Reconnect.”*

I could hear those words perfectly in his voice even though he’d never said them…

&#x200B;

After dinner, he and Patrick were headed right back to Smokey Oak.

  “Getting ready for the harvest tomorrow. Gotta keep the workers in line.” Patrick had said with a cocky grin, “Busy, busy, busy.”

&#x200B;

Really, he could’ve said anything and I really wouldn’t have cared. He could go wherever he wanted, so long as he and Joel were out of the house so I could go about my business in relative peace.

&#x200B;

When they were gone, I drove back down to the church. The Bible study was being held in the same room they held those boring meet and greets after mass. I could hear some voices from that room as I came in, but nobody noticed me sneaking into the chapel to grab my camera. The battery was long since dead, but that was fine. I’d expected that. I just slipped the camera into my purse and headed home. Shannon was snoring away in the living room when I came in through the door. She didn’t pay me any mind as I went upstairs to the office and I made sure to close and lock the door behind me.

&#x200B;

I took the memory card out of the camera and plugged it into my laptop, then put on my headphones to go through the video I’d recorded. Sure enough, I had a little under two hours of footage there. One long, uncut video. It was a little shorter than I’d expected, but it was probably fine.

&#x200B;

I opened it up on my laptop and watched as it started to play.

&#x200B;

The first hour or so was pretty uneventful. I’d expected as much and periodically skipped through it, waiting until I saw some sign of activity in the chapel. 

&#x200B;

About an hour and twenty minutes after I’d started recording, several people finally came in. I recognized Patrick and Joel among the group including roughly four other men, although I saw no sign of Father Abraham himself. Joel was carrying a mop and a bucket while two of the men behind him were carrying what looked to be some sort of heavy steamer trunk.

&#x200B;

  *“Set it by the altar. Keep it locked.”* I heard Patrick say as he directed the men around. He approached the altar and lit some of the candles. As he did, I saw Father Abraham entering the chapel, walking with a slow, deliberate pace.

*“Are we prepared?”* I heard him ask.

 *“Nearly. Just finishing the setup.”* Patrick assured him. I watched him get down onto the ground and draw a large circle in chalk on the floor of the altar. Inside of that circle, he drew some kind of ornate cross. Father Abraham watched him as he worked, before advancing on the steamer trunk.

&#x200B;

  *“Ah… How is our lost lamb?”* He asked.

  *“Awake.”* One of the men replied, *“Should we…”*

  *“No. Not until the setup is complete.”* Abraham said, looking back at Patrick who was still working away at the cross on the floor.

&#x200B;

When he was done, Patrick stood up and admired his handiwork. He looked at Father Abraham then gave a nod. Abraham extended a hand to one of the men, who placed something into it. Then, that man and his partner grabbed the steamer trunk and lifted it onto its side, so it was standing upright. They twisted it so that the lid was facing Father Abraham before stepping away.

  *“Into the circle.”* Abraham said, *“Let us pray, Children.”*

&#x200B;

Joel, Patrick and the other two men stood at various points around the chalk circle. I watched them clasp their hands together before they spoke in unison.

&#x200B;

  *“Sovereign Lord, we gather today as sinners in your sacred house. Sovereign Lord, we confess the sins that we have committed against you. In our thoughts and in our hearts. We repent. We beg of thee oh Lord, grant us salvation from perdition. Amen.”*

&#x200B;

With their prayer said, Father Abraham now spoke.

  *“Brothers, Children… Today we are here to seek the purification of one of our own. The son of Matthew Holman. A son who has sinned against not only his father, but The Father. A son who has defied the natural order… Matthew Holman… Do you ask us now, to save your boy from perdition?”*

  *“I ask you, Father Abraham…”* One of the men replied, *“I beg of you to save my boy.”*

  *“Then you accept the sacrifices of salvation. Salvation is a choice… I have said this often. And the choice will be made for him. You accept this?”*

  *“I accept this, Father Abraham.”* Matthew said, *“Please… Please grant my son release…”*

&#x200B;

Seemingly satisfied, I watched as Abraham turned away from the circle and approached the steamer trunk. He seemed to tinker with it for a moment, unlocking it, I think. Whatever he’d been handed earlier must’ve been the key. The trunk's lid swung open and out of it toppled a boy. He couldn’t have been older than fifteen or sixteen. I heard him gasping for air and sobbing as he crashed to the ground.

&#x200B;

  *“I’m sorry… I’m sorry… Please… I…”*

  *“Now is not the time for penance, my son…”* Father Abraham hissed, grabbing the boy by the shirt and dragging him like a dog towards the circle of men. *“You’ve already chosen the path of sin.”*

  *“I didn’t!”* The boy cried, *“We were… We weren’t doing anything wrong…”*

  ***“DO NOT LIE TO ME UPON THE ALTAR OF GOD, BOY!”*** Father Abrahams voice was loud enough to echo off the walls of the chapel, *“****THE LORD SEES ALL. THE LORD KNOWS ALL AND HE SPEAKS ONLY TO ME!*** *Your every thought. Your every fault. Your every sin* ***are*** ***known to me, Jeremy Holman.****”*

&#x200B;

Father Abraham stared down at the sobbing boy, a coldness on his face that was impossible not to see, even on the low resolution of the camera.

 *“Lust… It is a foul quality that a man must overcome to live in Christlike purity… It is a sickness all men must confront. But lust is not what God intended for a civilized man meant to live within his Society. People in this day and age fail to understand this… But you my boy… You… Your lust is far more twisted and perverse than most. Your father tells us you won’t share the name of this… Other boy, you were with. You think you’re protecting him, I suppose… But… There is no refuge in my domain for homosexuals… There is no shelter in this place for the sinner. You will give him to us. And like you, he will be purified.*”

 *“Please no…”* The boy sobbed, *“Please no…”*

&#x200B;

Father Abraham didn’t reply. He took something from his belt. I couldn’t see what it was immediately, but it didn’t take long before the light from the candles caught it in just the right way that I could identify it.

&#x200B;

He was holding a knife.

&#x200B;

The boy… Jeremy tried to shrink back, but both Patrick and Joel grabbed him, holding him in place.

  *“Rejoice, my child. You are being saved.”* Father Abraham said before placing a comforting hand on the boy's shoulder and plunging the dagger into his heart.

&#x200B;

I let out a strangled cry and covered my mouth, as if the men in the video could somehow hear me. I stared at the screen in horror, watching as Father Abraham tore the dagger out of the boys chest. His body went limp. Patrick grabbed the boy by the hair, jerking his head back and exposing his neck. I watched as Father Abraham took a cup from the altar and placed it under his throat, before drawing the knife across his neck…

&#x200B;

I was grateful that Jeremy was facing away from the camera… I don’t know if I could’ve stomached watching this whole thing…

  “Lay him down.” Father Abraham said matter of factly, “And let us pray…”

&#x200B;

He set the dagger aside as the assembled men began to pray again. I only barely heard their words. My eyes were transfixed upon Father Abraham who stripped off his shirt and cast it to the ground. I watched him take the goblet of Jeremy’s blood… And I watched him press it to his lips. He tilted his head back, pouring the contents down his throat as the men around him prayed…

  *“Heavenly Father, purify our hearts. Heavenly Father, purify our souls. Heavenly Father, cleanse us of our sins. Heavenly Father, make us whole.”*

&#x200B;

With the goblet emptied, Father Abraham cast it aside. He let out a rasping exhale before kneeling before Jeremy’s corpse.

  “Holy Father… Zyvriel… Work through me, oh Lord… And bring us back Jeremy Holman… Bring him back to us, cleansed at last…”

He pressed his hands on the dead boys chest… And then I saw the light. 

&#x200B;

It seemed to come from Father Abraham itself and it was blinding… It was the same light I’d seen the other night.

&#x200B;

That was where the recording ended. Well… In a sense. The video went on for another five minutes or so, but the audio and visuals were both impossible to make out, almost as if something had damaged the camera itself. 

&#x200B;

I closed out of the video, then I sat in my chair, staring blankly at the screen, trying to process everything I’d just seen. I’d just watched Father Abraham murder a teenage boy… And I’d watched my husband and his brother take part in it. 

&#x200B;

I’d made excuses for everything else.

&#x200B;

I sure as hell wasn’t making a fucking excuse for this!

&#x200B;

I wasted no time in packing a bag. I took the laptop with me and headed downstairs, grabbing my car keys as I did. I didn’t leave a note for Joel or anything. I didn’t want him to have any idea where I was going. I simply wanted to do what I should’ve done a week ago, and get the hell out of Smokey Falls.

&#x200B;

I should’ve known it wouldn’t be that easy…
