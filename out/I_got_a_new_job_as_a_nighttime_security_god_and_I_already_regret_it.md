How did I end up here, why didn't I take another job, maybe it was idiocy, maybe it was enticement, maybe it was a desire to discover the truth...

Listen, I don't have much time to chat, this short moment of peace before they wake up won't last long so I'll have to make it quick, I guess I'll try to give you more details later.

It was a normal night, except it wasn't, I had just got a new job, I was blinded by the possibilities for easy money, I wish I had thought otherwise, and it's not like I was being payed GOOD money, I would've gotten more washing dishes. Anyways, I had read the jobs description in the newspaper and it read;

"Family pizzeria looking for security to work the nightshift. 12am to 6am."

"Monitor cameras, ensure safety of equipment and animatronic characters. Not responsible for injury/dismemberment."

I obviously thought that last part was a joke, a little gag, at the time I was thinking "just HOW could these children's animatronics hurt me, this will be the easiest job of my life"

How wrong I was.

So I arrived at the place and the door was unlocked, the newspaper also spoke about how I would be alone during my shift, so I had assumed that a janitor had left the place unlocked for me. So without hesitation, I headed inside.

I stepped into the dark, open party room of the establishment, as I was heading to my office, I decided to check on the animatronics, I remember this place from my youth but I couldn't quite put my finger on the name of the animatronics, of course they were deactivated so I wasn't worried one bit, but I felt a sense of uneasiness brewing within me, a feeling I couldn't explain, I could've sworn that something was staring at me somewhere in the establishment, I passed it off as first night jitters however and continued to my office.

I arrive in my office after a small amount of searching around and the desk is a mess, with paper balls and used cups littering it, however I could easily point out the camera viewer from among the rubbish.

So my shift starts and, after a little bit, the phone starts to ring, I was a little confused but I decided to pick up, I still remember that first call, and it worried me to my core.

"Um, hello? Hello hello! I'd like to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night, I actually worked in that office before, finishing up my last week now as a matter of fact! Umm, now, there are some things you need to know before you start your shift, as you entered the building you probably saw the animatronic characters as you entered the building, let's see, there's Bonnie the bunny, chica the chicken and, of course, freddy fazbear! Now, I must warn you that certain characters tend to roam the building at night, something about stopping there servos from locking up, and...they aren't exactly friendly, due to technical anomalies, when the characters see you after dark, they will instead see you as a endoskeleton without its costume on, now since that's against the rules here at freddy fazbears pizza, they may try to...forcibly stuff you into a freddy fazbear suit, this isn't exactly pleasant, but don't worry! Those doors on your left and right weren't cheap, but they seem to keep the characters out of your office, so, all you have to do is keep an eye on the characters and only shut the doors if ABSOLUTELY NECCESARY, due to this place only running on a secondary generator at night, it is very possible to run out of power, and you don't want that. Anyways, that's about it, and I'll talk to you tommorow."

I stood there staring in disbelief for a little while, thoughts were racing through my head, "what does he mean by technical anomalies", "was that real", "am I going to DIE?"

No, surely it's all some kind of prank, there just trying to scare the new guy, I look at the clock, it reads 1 AM, it feels like time is moving more hastily, I continue checking the cameras, none of them have moved yet, I guess it was all some kind of sick prank!

It wasn't.

I checked the camera once more, but something happened, the camera started to glitch and go dark, maybe it's just the anxiety kicking in, after a few minutes I check again.

Shit, Bonnie's gone.

So he WASNT lying, I check all the cameras and eventually notice him in the party room, I feel like...somethings looking at me from within it, some kind of spiritual force, it felt familiar.

No, there are more important matters to worry about, I decide to check back at the time, it reads 2 am, wow that was fast, I look at the show stage on the cameras, Chica has left the stage. However, I cant find her on the cameras, I've checked everywhere, maybe she's in the kitchen, I have to stop checking my powers at 49%.

OK I was right, she's in the kitchen, I can hear the pots and pans. Where's Bonnie? I've checked everywhere, OK, he is in the hallway, should I shut the door, is he too close?!?! Yeah, I'll shut the door, I can still hear chica in the kitchen, 4am, surely it hasn't been 2 hours, the doors been shut for a while now, I don't think Bonnie is there, I'll open it.

OH CRAP HE IS AT THE DOOR!

Almost immediately I slam the door shut, he pounds the door repeatedly until it eventually stops, but I can see his shadow.

I check the cameras for chica, she is in the hallway, I think that means I'm good

It's been 5am for quite a while I can make it!

Oh god  my power is at 3% Bonnie won't leave! What am I supposed to d-

The power runs out, the door opens, I think this is the end. I shut my eyes, hoping for a quick death, when I hear a pleasant little tune, I check the left door and can see freddy standing there, his eyes glowing, the music continues to play until eventually it stops.

Boom, boom, boom. His footsteps echo throughout the office, a horrible stench hits my face, he is infront of me, I thought it was the end, until...

The clock rang and the power switched back on, the time read 6am, I nearly broke out into tears, freddy stood infront of me, hand reached out, I was finally done.

But, something was wrong, I felt a sense of mystery, what was that spiritual feeling I felt when Bonnie stared at me, what was that horrible smell when freddy was infront of me?

There is a hidden mystery about this place, and I was going to figure it out, even if I risked my life
