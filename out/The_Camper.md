In 2013, I spent a few months living in a camper next to my grandpa’s farmhouse in rural Michigan. It was quiet and isolated. The kind of place where you could hear a twig snap from a hundred feet away.

One night, just as I was dozing off, a loud *bang* jolted me awake. It came from the window right next to my bed. My heart pounded as I sat up, staring into the darkness of my bedroom. I listened for movement, but the night was still.

Probably just a branch falling, I told myself. The wind had been strong earlier. I pulled the blanket over my head and forced myself back to sleep.

The next morning, I stepped outside to check. No fallen branches. No footprints. No sign of anything. Maybe an animal? A raccoon or a deer? But it would have to be big to hit the camper with that much force.

It nagged at me, but I brushed it off.

A week later, it happened again. Another *bang.* This time, I got up quickly and peeked through the curtain. But the night was pitch black, my reflection staring back at me from the window.

I held my breath, listening.

Then—faintly—leaves crunching. Footsteps.

I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight, shining it out the window. Nothing. No movement, no eyes glowing in the dark. Just the empty field and the distant outline of my grandpa’s farmhouse.

I told myself it was paranoia, made sure the door was locked, and climbed back into bed.

But the banging didn’t stop. It came back, again and again—always around midnight. Some nights, I thought I heard something breathing outside the thin camper walls.

Then, one night, I woke up to something different.

Not a bang.

A soft, slow *tap* on the window.

Like someone was standing just outside, drumming their fingers against the glass. 

That was it. I couldn’t take it anymore. The next morning, I packed my things and moved into the farmhouse.

Months passed. I moved to a new town, and started fresh. I barely thought about those nights in the camper anymore.

Until I saw the news.

A man had been arrested— a serial killer. He had been living in an abandoned house back in my old town. My stomach twisted as they showed footage of the house.

I knew that house.

It was the one directly across from my camper.

I felt sick. That house had always creeped me out, especially at night. I used to walk past it to get phone signal, and every time, I felt like I was being *watched.*

I *was* being watched.

Police found weapons inside. And pictures. Pictures of his victims.

Pictures of me.

Pictures of my camper.

And the worst part?

My camper door lock had been broken the whole time. I always thought it locked. It didn’t.

He could have come in any time he wanted.

Even now, the thought of how close I was to *him* keeps me up at night…
