My name is Eliot Morrow. I worked maintenance at the Lafferty Arboretum for nearly five years before I got offered what they called a “special assignment.” I’d just turned 29. My girlfriend had just left me. I wasn’t in a place to say no to anything that paid more.

The arboretum was state-funded but never busy—more of a tax write-off for the university than a real attraction. Rows of exotic trees and a few climate-controlled greenhouses spread across about 300 acres just south of the city. I worked mostly nights, sweeping the paths, checking locks, hosing the algae off the irrigation pipes. Sometimes I wouldn’t see another human for entire shifts. It suited me.

The offer came from Dr. Carmine, the arboretum’s director. He asked me to stop by the administration building one morning after my shift. He had a tight little smile that made me feel like I was already being tricked.

“I’m going to ask you to do something a little different,” he said. “We’re opening a new section of the grounds. It’s… experimental. The department’s calling it Sector E. We’ll pay you triple your current hourly rate to monitor the area from sundown to sunrise. No gardening. No cleaning. Just walk the trails. Report what you see. You’ll be the only one allowed inside.”

I didn’t hesitate. “Yeah,” I said, “sounds easy.”

“Good,” he said. “Just remember: don’t speak while you’re in there. No humming. No muttering. Don’t even think too loud if you can help it.”

I laughed.

He didn’t.

That night, they gave me a keycard and a map—drawn by hand—of the new section. It wasn’t marked on the main blueprints. No signs pointed to it. You had to go behind the eastern greenhouse, follow a winding dirt trail past some rusting sheds, and eventually, you’d reach a gate with a scanner on a stone pillar.

That was my first red flag. Why did a botanical garden need a biometric scanner?

Still, I pressed my thumb to the sensor, and the gate clicked open.

I stepped into Sector E.

Inside, it looked like the rest of the arboretum—but off. It wasn’t just the layout, which seemed to double back on itself or subtly shift underfoot. It was the plants. I’m not a botanist, but I know the garden catalog pretty well. These weren’t in it.

Some trees had braided trunks, growing in precise helixes like DNA strands. Others had bark like mirrors, so polished I could see my reflection bend and ripple with every breeze. The air smelled like copper and petrichor. And the quiet—God, the quiet wasn’t peaceful. It was pressing. Listening to it too long made you feel like something was listening back.

My first night was fine. Weird, but fine. I walked the looping path, made notes about the layout, and returned by morning. The sun never really rose inside Sector E. It just… got dimmer. Less oppressive.

Second night, I noticed my footsteps echoing strangely. Not just behind me, but ahead. I’d stop—and the echoes would keep walking. Once or twice, I thought I heard breathing that wasn’t mine.

Third night, I saw something move.

It wasn’t a person. Or maybe it was. Just off the trail, beneath one of the metallic trees, was a figure sitting cross-legged in the grass. Entirely still. Not looking at me. I didn’t approach. I made a note, kept walking. When I looped back fifteen minutes later, it was gone.

That morning, I brought it up with Dr. Carmine. He nodded, almost like he’d been waiting.

“They show up from time to time,” he said.

“They?”

He hesitated. “Reflections. Memories. Echoes, if you like. Not dangerous. Don’t engage. Just record and continue.”

By the fourth night, I couldn’t pretend this was normal. The flora was changing. Trees bloomed and withered in minutes. A bush I’d passed on the outer loop had grown pale, human-shaped pods on its branches. One of them twitched.

I stopped sleeping.

By the end of my first week, I’d developed a ritual—counting the steps it took to walk each path. I needed something stable, something concrete. 212 steps from the gate to the reflecting pond. 78 steps from the pond to the loop arch.

Until the night it was 213 steps.

I stopped cold.

I turned around, retraced—still 213. Somewhere between gate and pond, something had lengthened the space by a step.

Then I heard my own voice—from behind me.

“I wouldn’t turn around,” it said. It was me. But I hadn’t spoken. My mouth was dry. “Keep walking. Don’t look. Don’t talk.”

I ran. I didn’t know where I was running to, because the path behind me had changed. There were now five forks where there used to be two. The trees leaned in. Their mirrored bark showed me dozens of mes, all looking terrified.

I collapsed by the gate, heaving breaths that didn’t echo.

The scanner wouldn’t accept my thumb.

That’s when I realized: I hadn’t spoken aloud once since entering. Not since my first night. The fear wasn’t just of what I’d see. It was of being heard.

And then I did speak. Just a whisper.

“Please.”

The garden shuddered.

The plants stopped moving. The air thickened. Something behind the trees breathed in.

And I heard dozens—no, hundreds—of versions of my own voice, whispering back:

“Please. Please. Please. Please. Please—”

I blacked out.

I woke up in my apartment. Still dressed in my uniform. No record of me leaving. No missing time. Just a note on my desk.

“Sector E no longer requires maintenance.”

I tried to go back, but the trail was gone. The eastern greenhouse had no door. The woods behind it were thick and untouched.

I asked the staff. They looked confused when I said “Sector E.”

Dr. Carmine? I’ve never been able to find him again. No one by that name ever worked for the arboretum, they say.

Sometimes, late at night, I hear echoes in my apartment. My own voice. Repeating the same words over and over:

“Don’t speak. Don’t look. Don’t count the steps.”

But I always do. Every night, I do.

And the number keeps going up
