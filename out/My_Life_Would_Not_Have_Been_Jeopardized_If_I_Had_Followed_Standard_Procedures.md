I need to put this down in writing before I expire. I may have a week to live, maybe a month at most, but I do not see that happening.

For my colleagues who are not aware or who have not read the official report, Dr. Buchard has been conducting unauthorized experiments in Lab B10-04 at Facility XVZ-01. She has been doing it for months under the noses of our esteemed executives and senior staff. Unfortunately, I only found out too late. This could have been avoided by following standard procedures.

I first started having suspicions of her unauthorized experiments when I was working on Fluid Sample 12 three months ago, on January 2, 2025, at precisely 19:03. For those who are unaware, this sample was found near an unidentified flying object that crashed into a remote island in the Pacific on August 23, 2024. The recovery team arrived at the site roughly ten hours after the crash. Once there, they identified that the origin of the craft was not from Earth. It did not exhibit any identifiable marks or patterns that matched previous encounters. The simplest way to describe it was that it looked like a boomerang with a 37.8-meter wingspan. The tip of the wing to the head measured 15.3 meters, and it was consistently 0.8 meters thick. There was no color to report; it had a perfect reflection, supported by the reflectivity reading of 100% throughout the entire craft.

The craft looked entirely undamaged. But without access to its interior, there was no way to truly assess how intact it was. The recovery team almost missed it, but just before they left, they noticed a pool of liquid with the appearance of water in a small hole in the ground roughly 10 meters from the craft. Considering that it was 37 degrees Celsius at the time, the pool should have decreased in volume due to evaporation. However, one of the junior members pointed it out, and they did an initial assessment of the liquid onsite.

From their report, Fluid Sample 12 almost acts like water. It has practically the same viscosity and transparent appearance. If I put this sample in a glass, no one would be able to tell the difference. The only thing that differentiates this sample from water is that it has an extremely high boiling point and low freezing point. It boils at 201.74 degrees Celsius and freezes at around -35.17 degrees Celsius.

When I made my way to Lab B10-02 to run my experiments, I noticed that the sample was not in its usual resting place in the refrigerator. After looking for it for several minutes, I saw through the lab window that the door to Lab B10-04 was slightly ajar. I went to investigate and saw Dr. Buchard operating some of the thermal equipment. At first, I thought she was doing her usual analysis, the ones that involve conducting standard temperature experiments on fluid-based samples. Then, I noticed that she was running thermal tests on Fluid Sample 12.

When I checked the schedule for any conflicts, I saw that I was the only one assigned to the sample for 30 days. Dr. Buchard was assigned to study Fluid Sample 10 in Lab B10-02 for 43 days. However, considering that she was new to the facility, I deduced that she was unaware that she was using Fluid Sample 12 by mistake. In hindsight, I should have reported that to the superiors, whether it was an error on her part or otherwise. Considering the events that transpired now, it falls under the category of otherwise with motivation unknown.

Due the relevance of Fluid Sample 10 in the recent series of events, I will provide a brief description of it. This sample appears to be a metallic fluid that does not react to any magnets. It almost looks like liquid mercury, but it has the same viscosity and freezing point as Fluid Sample 12. So far, we have not determined the exact boiling point of the liquid. All we can determine is that it is greater than 756 degrees Celsius, which is the current limit of the equipment available in this facility. This sample was found in a perfectly cylindrical capsule roughly 1 meter tall and 0.5 meters in diameter in the Nevada desert on September 13, 2021.

Given my seniority, I confronted her and notified her that her experiments were in violation of standard protocol. However, I let her off with a warning due to her junior status and informed her that this should never happen again. Her acknowledgment left me satisfied. And indeed, I did not catch evidence of her running unauthorized experiments until yesterday, April 2, 2025.

Before I delve into the series of events that transpired, I want to take a moment to describe myself on a more personal level. Given the nature of our jobs, we rarely get the chance to do so. My beliefs and goals align perfectly with one of the core objectives of the Institute: to safeguard humanity from unknown threats. Considering that we deal with unknowns all the time, the chances that one of them is a threat to humanity is non-zero. I have friends and family all over the world, and I would be considerably depressed—more than I am now—if I failed to uphold this objective. I hope that I have not failed and that everyone in our facility will do their due diligence to uphold this objective, even if it costs my own life.

On April 2, 2025, Dr. Singh and I were conducting routine equipment calibration and maintenance in Lab B10-02 at 14:03 when we discovered broken vials and flasks on the floor. I told my colleague to notify security and maintenance staff about the damaged equipment. Upon further investigation, I found that two secured containers labeled Fluid Sample 10 and Fluid Sample 12 were empty. After Dr. Singh made the call, we decided to leave the lab and initiate standard containment procedures. However, we were met with Dr. Buchard—or what appeared to be Dr. Buchard—blocking the only exit to the lab.

Her appearance was unsettling at best. Based on my observations, there appeared to be several wounds on her body, evidenced by multiple bloodstains on her lab attire. Her eyes seemed to be missing, presumably from a previous physical conflict. However, a combination of clear and metallic fluid seemed to be flowing between multiple orifices in her body, both natural and artificial, many exhibiting anti-gravitational behavior. I saw that the clear liquid formed an arced bridge between her left eye and right nostril, while the metallic fluid formed an arced bridge between her right eye and left nostril. The combination of clear and metallic fluid, forming a spiraling effect, also appeared to connect both of her ears and her mouth. None of the fluids ever seemed to touch the ground. She did not make any sound indicating intelligence, only a constant gurgling noise emanating from her mouth. Reflecting on it now, I deduce that the fluid samples somehow took control of her body.

However, that was not what crossed my mind at the time. I remember that fear overtook me that day. I wanted to run, scream, and get out of there. This is not something any of us are usually prepared for, especially the technical staff.

Unfortunately, I was the closest to the entity controlling Dr. Buchard’s body. It rushed towards me and tackled me to the ground. I remember struggling, trying to get the entity off me, but I was physically too weak to overcome its strength. Some of the liquid bridged to her mouth slowly started to form a bridge to mine. Contact with my lip was made roughly 15 seconds after I was tackled to the ground. The bridge was completed after 30 seconds. I could feel the liquid traveling from my mouth into my nasal canal, presumably to target my brain.

I recall feeling a fainting spell coming over me. More than that, I felt numbness and twitching occurring all over my body, starting from my head. I started to feel like I could not move my arms, legs, or head. To say it was an unpleasant feeling is an understatement. At least I did not feel any pain, just a gradual feeling of numbness, as if an anesthetic was traveling from my head to the rest of my body.

Dr. Singh saved my life. He hit the entity on the back of the head with a fire extinguisher, interrupting the connection between myself and it. The entity fell to my right side. I quickly regained my senses and told Dr. Singh to use the fire extinguisher on it. He complied and unleashed its contents all over the entity. It quickly fled from us and hid in the storage part of the lab. Both Dr. Singh and I quickly left the lab and forced it into quarantine, sealing the lab and preventing anything from entering or leaving it.

I quickly left Dr. Singh’s company and entered Lab B10-04, which was fortunately empty. I activated the quarantine procedure from inside the lab, sealing myself in it. This will prevent my body from escaping if I end up sharing the same fate as Dr. Buchard. The security team arrived five minutes later, further securing both my prison and Dr. Buchard’s. They have been talking to me, comforting me, and trying to find solutions to remove the entity from my body.

Typing this up now, I think my instinct was correct. The fire extinguisher was too cold for the entity, as its temperature is lower than the fluid samples’ freezing point. However, it is highly unlikely that we could have saved Dr. Buchard’s life by severing the connection of the entity from her body, considering the physical damage she sustained.

Sadly, my life is in jeopardy thanks to the entity’s connection to me. I can feel pressure in odd parts of my body. Yesterday, it started small with occasional numbness and twitching here and there. Today, I have lost all feeling in my left arm, and I cannot move it. The terrifying part is that I can see my fingers moving on their own, indicating that the entity is trying to gain control of my body. I can only type with my right hand, which is difficult, to say the least.

What horrifies me the most is that the entity can either control multiple bodies at once or it can multiply itself by splitting. The quarantine team has mentioned that Dr. Buchard’s body is still alive and moving around in the lab. This would bode very ill for humanity if this thing breaks out of the lab.

DOOM TO YOUR RACE! YOU WILL ALL BOW TO ME!

It seems that the entity in my body briefly controlled both my arms and typed the above message. I am running out of time.

Final conclusions: this entity appears to be a combination of Fluid Samples 10 and 12. The fluid itself can multiply when it transfers from host to host, as evidenced by my gradual loss of control over my body due to contact with it. However, given the typed message, the fluid has one mind of its own, indicating a hive mind behavior. Whether the fluid itself is intelligent or a signal is being transmitted to it, we cannot say.

As for Dr. Buchard, the quarantine team has not identified a motive yet. There’s a possibility of foreign interference, but nothing concrete.

I am signing off now. The quarantine team messaged me just now that they might have found a solution for me. One of their tests on Dr. Buchard has left her incapacitated, but her vitals are still optimal. However, I do not have my hopes up, considering that there are too many unknowns here.

For those who have access to the whereabouts of my close friends and family, please tell them that local authorities on some remote tropical island have declared me missing assuming the worst has happened. You can name any reason, like hiking. They know that I am a sucker for the tropics. 

Now, I am actually signing off, surrendering myself to fate. I am hoping for the best but expecting the worst.
