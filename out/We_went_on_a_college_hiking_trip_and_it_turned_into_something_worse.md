The Email hit my inbox late Thursday afternoon, glowing with that sterile, too-official blue font used by the university’s automated system. It was sent from the Student Enrichment Office, usually reserved for club updates or last minute event flyers. I've never really cared enough to read their emails, but this one was different. The Subject line read: *“Summer Hiking Trip: Remote PNW Lodges - Apply Now!”* A month-long program in the heart of the Pacific Northwest: no phones, no Wi-Fi, just miles of wilderness, fresh air, and a rotating schedule of “mindful disconnect activities.” It was like it was *designed* for me.   
  
I leaned back in my desk chair and stared out the small apartment window. Finals were wrapping up. The air was warm enough to sleep with the fan on and everyone I knew was either going home, locking themselves inside with internships or studying for summer classes. I didn’t want any of that. I needed out. Trees. Cold river. Icy air that gives that minty fresh feeling when inhaled. Dirt under my nails and nights so quiet I can hear my own breath. This trip wasn’t just a break, it felt like a reset.  
  
But there was one problem: Fabian.   
  
He was my roommate, and not the kind you could just leave for a month without some kind of conversation. I know what you all might be thinking, *“Liam, just go without him.”* But the truth is, Me and Fabian were basically the equivalent of left and right, Gumball and Darwin, Goku and Krillian. Basically, we got really close through the few years together and didn’t want to do something exciting without him. Fabian was the kind of guy who collected metal band shirts with names made up of squiggles and bullshit (like seriously, search up *TorsoFuck* and tell me you can understand what that logo says), ate spaghetti with chopsticks, kept his blinds permanently shut, and once spent twelve straight hours trying to mod *Bloodborne* on our shared PS5. We’d been randomly paired freshman year and somehow never moved out. He was weird, sure, but in a way that grew on you, like a strange piece of music that doesn’t make sense until the fifth listen. In this case, the 20th month together, but I digress.  
  
 Fabian was perched on the edge of the couch when I walked in that night, slouched down, his long, thin, almost unnatural arms grazing the ground with a controller in its hands. His slim face was lit by the pale glow of the television like some spirit pulled from another realm. The apartment smelled faintly of burnt pizza cause god knows Fabian cant cook let alone bake a costco frozen pizza correctly as well as Monster energy, specifically *Pacific Punch*. His supposed favorite flavor. Onscreen, his character, gaunt, hooded, dressed like a plague doctor, was locked in a frantic duel with Pontiff Sulyvahn in *Dark Souls III.* His health bar blinked red, but his hands moved like water. I stood there for a second, watching him dodge, roll, and cast spells. It was almost hypnotic. Fabian wasn’t all that great at much in a traditional sense. He skipped class, forgot to eat, and once managed to set off our fire alarm trying to make toast, but give him a controller, and he was a surgeon.  
  
 “Dodge left when he double slashes, then hit him with that big fuck you spell.” I said, walking closer. “I know.” He grunted back. The next few seconds were a blur of movements and screeching orchestra from the backtrack. I can’t lie, all of this movement got me hungry and there was a convenient bag of *Takis Blue Heat* sitting by his arm. My hand shot forward, brushing the controller, *slightly* tapping his jump button. Takis stuffed in my mouth, I  watched as his character jumped up in the air only to be helplessly slammed into the ground in such a fashion that could only be described as an art. That cleaver came down like thunder. The screen faded to black. Fabian tore off his headphones and turned slowly, eyes narrowed. “You idiot.”I raised my hands, blue dust clinging onto my fingers. “I was hungry.” “You *killed* me.”

“He was gonna kill you anyway.”

“I had him. One more spell.”

“Well, now you can do it again. Practice makes perfect.”

Fabian shook his head and muttered something under his breath that sounded like a curse in Latin. I waited a beat before sliding onto the arm of the couch.

“Alright, serious time. I need you to come on a trip with me.”

His expression didn’t change. “Trip where?”

“Month-long hiking retreat. College-sponsored. It’s like, a real thing. Hiking, cabins, no phones, no people, well, some people, but not a lot. Out in the woods.”

Fabian blinked. “That sounds like something people use as a punishment.”

“It’ll be good for you. Nature’s healing and all that.”

“I’m not broken.”

I ignored that. “I already applied. They said we can bring a roommate. I put your name down.”

“You *what?*”

“It’s refundable,” I lied. “But come on, man. When’s the last time you saw daylight? Or, like, ate something green?”

Fabian leaned back and sighed. “You’re asking me to live in a cabin. With strangers. Without Wi-Fi. For a month. That’s not a vacation. That’s a psychological experiment.”

I laughed. “It’s not that bad. I’ll carry your pack, I’ll handle food, hell, I’ll even bring a solar charger so you can play *Elden Ring* on your Steam Deck when no one’s looking.”

“I don’t even have a Steam Deck.”

“I’ll *buy* you a Steam Deck.”

He raised a pale eyebrow. “With what money?”

I hesitated. “I’ll buy you that crate of energy drinks you’re always whining about. The Japanese kind. With the label that looks like a nuclear warning.”

He folded his arms and stared at me for a long moment, eyes unreadable. Then: “You’re serious.”

“Dead serious.”

Fabian exhaled slowly, rubbing his temples like I was giving him a migraine through sheer optimism. “If I die out there, Liam, I’m haunting you. Forever.”

“So that’s a yes?”

“It’s a *conditional* yes. No forced team-building games. No trust falls. No singing around the fire.”

“No promises.”

He groaned but gave me a lopsided smirk. “Fine. But if it sucks, you owe me a week of silence and a full fridge of Red Bulls.”

“Deal,” I said, reaching out to shake his hand.

His fingers were cold and bony, like shaking hands with a mannequin.

Even then, part of me noticed how off he looked under the soft light, dark circles under his eyes, skin stretched too tight across his face. I chalked it up to bad sleep and too much caffeine.

I had no idea that was the last normal conversation we’d have.  
  


The night before the trip, Seattle’s skies opened up with that classic, pounding rain we’d both grown numb to. I was triple-checking our gear in the living room, stuffed packs, waterproof layers, emergency food. Fabian, meanwhile, was hunched on the couch, scrolling his phone with one leg folded under the other like some lanky specter haunting the cushions.

“You sure they said no phones?” he asked without looking up.

“Yeah. The email said we turn them in at the start. Total disconnect.”

Fabian looked up, pale brow raised. “What if there’s an emergency?”

“There’ll be a sat phone at the lodge, I’m sure. And a radio or something. Look, man, people do this kind of thing all the time.”

He let out a dry laugh. “People also go missing in the woods all the time.”

I stopped stuffing a sleeping bag into its sack. “You’re not backing out now, are you?”

He glanced at the duffel bag I’d packed for him. “I already signed away a month of my life. Just making sure I’m not walking into a cult.”

“You’re not,” I said, although something about his tone made me glance at the email again. It really *had* come from a college address, one of those @seattle.edu ones only students could get. Everything looked legit. But I hadn’t recognized a single name on the list of attendees.

The next morning, we loaded into my shitbox 2015 honda accord just before six. The rain was coming down in thick sheets now, like someone had poured a bucket over the city. I could barely see five feet in front of us. Streetlights bled through the windshield in pale yellow streaks, and traffic lights looked like ghostly halos.

Fabian tossed his pack in the back and folded himself into the passenger seat, knees practically in his chest (Think of L from Death note), “Remind me again why I agreed to this?”

“Because I promised you ungodly amounts of caffeine, and because you have no self-control when someone offers to carry your gear.”

“That’s fair,” he muttered. “You do realize I’m probably going to hate every second of this.”

“Probably. But you’ll have a great story when we get back. Like, *Fabian vs. Nature: The Epic Battle of a Skeletal Man and His Hatred for Dirt.*”

He snorted, watching the rain trail down the window. “You think I’m skeletal?”

“You’ve got a *Slenderman* build, bro. All elbows and shadows. If we run out of firewood, I’m breaking off one of your limbs.”

“Better hope I don’t disappear first. Slendermen tend to do that.”

We drove for a while in silence, the kind that wasn’t awkward but heavy with early morning drowsiness. The rain drummed on the roof like static. Roads thinned out as we left the city, first suburbs, then trees and long stretches of highway. Mist rolled off the mountains in the distance like slow-moving ghosts.

Fabian eventually leaned his head back against the seat, voice quiet. “So... you really think this’ll be worth it?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “But I think we both need something. A reset.”

He closed his eyes, one long arm draped across his stomach. “If this turns into one of those lost-in-the-woods documentaries, I’m blaming you.”



We pulled into a secluded warehouse lot just before nine. The place was... off. Not creepy, exactly. Just oddly quiet. Overgrown bushes, a rusted fence half-fallen over, puddles that reflected only vague outlines. A single yellow streetlamp buzzed overhead, flickering now and then.

A group was already there, maybe ten people, all clustered near a dull gray shuttle bus with fogged-up windows. Most wore hiking gear, but their faces were hidden beneath hoods, beanies, scarves. No one was talking. No one waved. As well pulled in, they unanimously turned to look at us.

“Were we late?” Fabian asked, peering through the window.

“I don’t think so,” I said. “But they’re all waiting on us*.*”

“That’s weird, right?”

“Little bit.”

We parked and grabbed our gear, sloshing through puddles to reach the group. A man with an orange clipboard nodded at us, tall, maybe thirty, with a full beard and rainproof coat. He didn’t give his name, just pointed us to the shuttle.

Inside, the windows were too fogged to see out. The air was warm, but stale. Everyone else had taken seats along the edges, leaving the front row open like they were expecting us.

Fabian dropped into the seat beside me, whispering, “Okay, seriously. I don’t recognize *any* of these people. Not from campus, not from the forums, nothing.”

I glanced around. He was right. And it struck me then, with that quiet kind of unease that builds in your stomach: this was supposed to be a college-sponsored event. There should’ve been someone we recognized. Even just a vaguely familiar face from lectures or the library.

But nothing.

The shuttle lurched forward, and the warehouse vanished into a curtain of rain.

The drive to the lodge took hours. The shuttle climbed winding backroads that cut through thick pine forests, past moss-covered rocks and ancient trees that seemed to lean in as if watching. The further we went, the more the fog pressed in, and the less reception our phones had, not that it mattered. We’d already turned them in to the clipboard guy, who said it was policy. "Full immersion," he’d muttered.

Fabian had shot me a look after that, mouthing *cult*, but he gave up the phone anyway. I knew he wasn’t about to hike back home.

We finally pulled off a narrow road and rolled up to a rustic lodge, nestled between a ridge and a dark lake that barely reflected the gray sky. The building was large, three stories of dark-stained wood and stone, with a wraparound porch and small windows glowing with yellow light. No signage. No flag. Just sitting there like it had grown from the forest itself.

People wordlessly grabbed their gear and filed inside. Fabian and I were the last ones off.

“Cozy,” I offered, trying to keep the tone light.

Fabian stared at the lake. “That thing’s too still.”

“You want it to wave at you?”

He shook his head. “No dumbass… Just... feels like we’re being watched.”

We were shown to a bunkroom on the second floor, six beds, four of them already claimed. No introductions. Just grunts and nods. Everyone kept to themselves, unpacking methodically. One girl had a tattoo of a sun on the back of her hand. Another guy had some strange pendant with unfamiliar symbols on it, like something out of a forgotten language.

Fabian noticed it too. He leaned close to me while he unpacked. “Why does everyone here look like they’ve been through a storm?”

“What do you mean?”

“They’re all *too quiet*. No joking, no complaining. No one’s asked where we’re from, what we’re studying—none of the usual stuff. They look... tired.”

I didn’t answer. I was starting to feel it too.

The hike started early the next morning. Clipboard guy, now introduced only as “Tom” (though I enjoy clipboard guy more) stood at the trailhead and handed out laminated maps, though he told us we wouldn’t really need them. “The trail loops around. Stay with the group and you’ll be fine.”

The forest was dense. Sunlight barely made it through the canopy. The air smelled of damp soil and bark, and every step seemed to echo in that silence that only deep woods can hold. Birds chirped, but not many. Even the wind felt muted.

Fabian kept pace beside me, one earbud in, but connected to nothing, I guess it’s a habit. His arms swinging awkwardly with his long stride. I could tell he was on edge, every time a branch cracked or a shadow moved across the underbrush, he flinched slightly. It didn’t help that we kept finding weird stuff. Dead birds off-trail, untouched except for the fact they all had the same missing body parts, an ear, and their eyes gouged out. On every. Single. One. Fabian pointed it out the first time in disgust.

“What do you think did that?” he asked.

“Fox? Maybe a hawk?”

“No blood,” he muttered. “That’s not normal.”

Later, we passed what looked like a small pile of fur and bones near a tree root. Again, no signs of a struggle. Just arranged like it had been *left* there.

By the third time, Fabian slowed his pace.

“This is getting weird,” he said quietly, glancing at the others ahead of us. “And none of them are saying anything about it.”

“You think they haven’t noticed?”

“Oh, they’ve noticed,” he said. “They’re just acting like it’s normal.”

We stopped for lunch near a clearing. No fire, just packed food. People ate in silence. A few of them shared glances, subtle but strange, like they were checking to see who was reacting to what. Fabian didn’t touch his food. He leaned close to me and whispered, “Liam. I don’t think any of these people go to our school.”

“What makes you say that?”

“No one’s mentioned classes, or clubs, or anything. I asked one girl what she was majoring in. She said ‘it doesn’t matter out here.’”

“Okay, yeah, that’s creepy.”

“I checked the sign-up board, man. This thing was supposed to be full of students. Like, dozens. Why are there only twelve of us?”

I didn’t have an answer.
