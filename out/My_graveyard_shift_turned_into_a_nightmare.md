For a while, I was working as a 24-hour keeper at my local hospital reception department.

This was a small hospis-like hospital with no urgent care, so no admissions during weekends. No admissions - no doctors or any staff at my department except me.

Basically, my weekend shift consisted of three parts: 
1)  Daytime part, when I did some cleaning and taking phone calls.
2) Graveyard part, when I was locking up the whole place, including multiple gates and doors, then chilling out until dawn.
3) The 'graveyard graveyard' part, as I was apparently only person in that unholy place to be qualified for body removal. So, whenever any patient was deceased, I received an order to carry them downstairs and across the inner yard, to the morgue. After this work had been done, I did update our mortality record journal. The record contains full name, age, date and time of death.

It was about 1AM at Sunday, as I received a phone call. The man on the phone was nervous. As he stated, he wanted to visit his old mom, who was supposed to be lying in our hospital.
Despite the call was made during night, when no visits are allowed, I quickly checked the patients list. The lady he was talking about was checked out.
So, as usual, I looked into the mortality record - if she had died recently, the man who was calling might not had been informed about that.

The mortality record seemed empty.
Then I double-checked the date and got confused: the lady had been checked out for two weeks!
I checked the mortality record for that date - and found her. This man's mom was dead for half a month, and somehow he didn't know that.

I was going to tell him, but was too late: he hung up the phone.

Minutes later, sitting in my empty room, I heard a humble, uncertain, but wery distinct door knock.

My heartbeat stumbled. I knew that it wasn't possible for someone to knock on that door, as I had locked the hospital up a few hours ago!

I rushed to the door and opened to see the empty hall. Then I proceeded to nervously check all doors that were supposed to be locked - and they all certainly were!
Totally confused, I returned to my place, where the phone was ringing frantically.

I picked up the phone. On the other side of the line was a nurse from our intensive care unit, which was at the 4th floor of the building. I still don't know why it was misplaced so badly - from my experience, the ICU is supposed to be located on the ground floor for accessibility reasons. 

The nurse was scared. She said that they just had saw a very nervous man shifting on their doorstep. He knocked on the door several times, then turned around and went downstairs, towards the reception. Towards me.

I hung up the phone and sat down, listening to my heartbeat. I was waiting for him...

But the nervous stranger didn't show up. Never again. He just vanished. There was no security cameras at the hospital, so, until this day, I don't know how he managed to bypass all the locks. Twice.
