Jessica was my first love. Sure, it was puppy love, her being my friend as us both only being six years old at the time, but it was love just the same. We spent hours together in the woods behind my childhood home every day playing games and exploring. It seemed like she always managed to find something that I never would have on my own, like she had some kind of sixth sense for the wilderness that led her to all things interesting and beautiful.

It was on one of these explorations on a bright and breezy spring day when she brought me to a clearing in the woods. The trees were in bloom, the ground was covered in a lush blanket of clover, and a doe was grazing with her fawn at the far end. The sunlight filtered through the canopy in gentle rays that illuminated the rich colors of the plants in a gentle glow that felt ethereal.

“Can you feel it?” she asked in her musical voice. “The magic of this place?”

Truthfully, all I could feel was the sun on my face and a light wind at my back, but I wasn’t about to tell her that. “Yes,” I replied with only slightly feigned reverence, it was a place of pure natural beauty after all. “It’s like a small slice of Heaven.”

She smiled radiantly at me when I said that. “Come!” she demanded happily and took ahold of my hand before leading me into the center of the clearing. I noticed that the deer continued to graze undisturbed as if they didn’t know we were there.

“Dance with me,” she said insistently. “Right here. Right now in this beautiful place.”

How could I say no to her? She was so happy, and I was lost in her bright smile and emerald green eyes that sparkled with love of life. I took her in my arms the same way I saw my dad do with my mom many times, and we danced to a silent tune that played in our hearts.

It wasn’t long before she put words to that music, and if her voice was musical when she spoke, it was positively supernatural when she sang. The song filled the air around us with sweet tones, and the natural noises of the forest faded away to nothing as we danced for I don’t know how long. But when the song was over Jessica asked me an unexpected question.

“Will you marry me?” she asked seriously.

The moment was too perfect. She was my best friend, and I loved her as only a child could. “Yes, of course I’ll marry you,” I replied.

She gave me a serious look. “Will you marry me right here, right now, in this blessed place?” She asked.

“Yes,” I said without a moment’s hesitation.

And that was when we exchanged our wedding vows. The only witnesses were the two deer and the trees of the forest. When it was over, she kissed me on the lips before hugging me. “You’re my husband, and I’m your wife,” she said happily. “We belong to each other forever now.

\*

“So you’re telling me you’re a polygamist, huh?” Tasha said playfully. She grinned at me mischievously, her smile lighting up her face. “You waited for our honeymoon to tell me that I’m your junior wife?” she teased.

I wrapped her naked body in my arms. “You’re my only wife,” I said confidently. “I lost contact with Jessica when my dad got a new job out of town when I was ten. She was devastated when I told her that we were moving, and she promised that we would be together again one day, but we were just kids, and we lost contact as soon my family left town. Somehow, I never got her phone number. I never saw the need since we saw each other every day. That was the end.”

Tasha gave me a playful pout. “She better be out of your life for real,” she said with mock seriousness. “I’m not about to share my husband with another woman!”

I laughed and kissed her on her full lips. “You’re the only woman for me,” I promised, and we made love again, enjoying each other as only newlyweds do.

\*

Ten blissful years later and our love only continued to grow. Ours was one of those marriages that you read about in stories, but never expect to find for real. We were prosperous, not rich, but reasonably well off. We had three children, two sons and a daughter, and they were all growing up in a way that I can only describe as well adjusted. We never lacked for intimacy, or conversation, or fun. We truly had a charmed life.

If only Jessica had never found us.

\*

My job transferred me back to my old town, the one where I had spent my youth until the age of ten. We bought a house on the edge of the forest I had once spent idyllic days in with my childhood best friend. It came with some acreage, which meant that we had plenty of land to let our kids play. The forest was like an old, familiar friend to me, and the idea of my children exploring it with the new friends they were sure to make brought a smile to my face.

We arrived in early fall, just as school was getting started. Combine that with all the hustle and bustle of getting moved in, settled in, me getting settled in at my new position at work, my wife finding a new job, and winter arrived before it felt like we had a chance to breathe.

Our children made friends, and I allowed them to play in the woods just as I had done at their ages. The holidays came and went, and by spring we were completely settled into our new, happy life in my childhood hometown.

It was a Saturday afternoon in early spring, not long after the winter snows had melted away and the soggy ground drained, when my children excitedly begged me to go into the woods with them.

“We found the most magical place!” Brad exclaimed breathlessly. “It’s like something from a fairy tale!”

“Yeah!” Francis chimed in. “Most of the forest is just waking up, but this place looks like it’s already summer!”

Lisa jumped up and down with excitement. “And the animals aren’t afraid of us there! They usually run away when they see us, but these ones stay!”

All three children chattered over each other excitedly, grabbing my hands, pants, whatever they could, and pulled at me to get me to go along with them.

“Tasha!” I called out. “Babe! The kids want me to go with them into the woods!”

My wife popped out of the kitchen, the smell of fresh baked goods accompanying her. “Go,” she commanded. “Play! Then I can have some peace and quiet!”

I gave her a mock shocked expression, and she stuck her tongue out at me playfully, an impish grin splayed across her beautiful face.

“Yay!” the kids yelled in unison, and I allowed them to drag me outside.

“Okay, okay!” I gave in. “Let go of me and we’ll go to this place you found.”

The forest had changed since I was a kid. The trees were bigger, and there were fewer animals, but it was still very much the forest I remembered from my youth. The trees were covered with buds and small leaves just opening up after a long winter nap. Some were blooming before the leaves grew in. Others would bloom later. The trees at the forest’s edge were younger, and unfamiliar to me as I had grown up a couple miles away, but as we walked deeper into the woods and the trees got older, I began to recognize a few of them.

I had us stop under an old, gnarled oak tree. I placed my hand on the trunk reverently. “This old oak was here when I was a kid. I used to climb it with my best friend all the time. When we were high in the upper branches it felt like were on top of the world.”

“You used to climb this tree daddy?” Francis asked in wide eyed wonder.

“Yes,” I confirmed.

“Then we need to climb it too!” he declared.

The other two chimed in with agreement, so what could I do? I laughed and helped them get started up the tree, lifting them up to the lower branches.

“Don’t go too high up,” I instructed them. “I’ll catch you if you fall, but if you fall from too high up we’ll both get hurt.”

The kids all promised not to go up too high, started grasping branches, lifting themselves up, and before long they all broke their promise, going high enough to look out over the tops of the smaller trees around the old oak.

A strong breeze blew through, rustling what leaves it could and shaking branches. The old oak’s branches creaked as they moved, like an old man’s joints first thing in the morning. Some leaves on the ground, left over from the previous autumn, swirled around and blew off deeper into the woods. I followed their path, and off in the distance I saw a lone deer standing, staring at me. I waved, and it ran off.

I looked back up the tree and watched as my children climbed, played, and laughed together. Then, when I felt that we’d spent enough time at the old oak, I called them down and we made our way to the spot they told me about.

As we got close, it began to look extremely familiar, and memories began to buzz around inside my head. The trees grew more vibrant. Leaves filled out branches here where further out they were only just starting to appear. Many of the trees were heavy with fragrant blooms, and the scent filled my nostrils like a familiar perfume from long ago.

Then we arrived out our destination, and the kids led me through the trees into a sunlit glen. The trees here were mature and laden with foliage. Beams of sunlight penetrated the canopy overhead, lighting up patches of fresh grasses and herbs. Squirrels and birds played in the treetops, rushing as they went about their business without any mind for us. Small animals, rabbits, a family of racoons, and some woodchucks explored the forest floor, stopping to eat the occasional tasty morsel.

The deer I saw earlier was there also. Standing by a mature willow tree, Tall and stately with thick branches hanging low like a curtain. It looked at me, and I swear I felt something shimmer in the air as though something passed between the animal the tree. It fixed its stare on me and didn’t look away until my children took my attention away.

“See?” Lisa asked joyfully. “Isn’t it beautiful daddy?”

I looked around, suddenly knowing exactly why this place was so familiar to me.

“Yes, it is,” I replied in awe. “In fact, you might not believe me, but I know this place very well. I used to come here all the time when I was a kid.”

“No way!” Brad, my oldest exclaimed excitedly.

“Yes way,” I replied with a laugh. I told you kids that I grew up here until the age of ten. I practically lived in these woods. Me, and my best friend, Jessica.”

“Daddy had a girlfriend!” Lisa shouted as she jumped up and down excitedly, clapping her hands with delight. “Tell us about her daddy!”

“Yeah, tell us!” the boys agreed.

How could I refuse. We all took a seat in a patch of sunny grass, and I regaled them with tales of my childhood in the woods with the best friend a little boy could have hoped to have for many hours. Then, as the light began to dim, I wrapped things up with a promise to come back and tell them more stories another day, and we went home to have a family dinner.

\*

“Daddy!” Lisa, our youngest called out from the living room. “Who’s that strange lady in the back yard?”

“What are you talking about?” I answered as I walked in to find her staring out the sliding glass door. “There shouldn’t be anyone in the yar-“

My breath caught in my throat as I saw what she was looking at. The woman in the back yard was slightly taller than average, lithe and willowy. Her sun kissed skin glowed with soft radiance. Her mane of chestnut brown hair flowed in waves down her back and over her shoulders. And her eyes, I knew those eyes! Those bright eyes of pure emerald that I had only ever seen one person possess.

“Jessica?” I breathed, stunned by what I was seeing. A million questions raced through my mind, chief among them were how she found me and why she was here. However, my questions were partly smothered by the unearthly beauty of the radiant creature standing in my back yard looking around like she was expecting to find something.

I placed a hand on Lisa’s shoulder. “Sweetie, I need you to go to your room while daddy handles this.”

“Okay,” she replied before turning to give me a quick hug and obediently heading upstairs.

I waited until I heard her door close then let myself out the back door. The sound of it caught the woman’s attention and her gaze settled on me. Her emerald eyes sparkled with delight as she saw me. “Andrew!” She called out excitedly as she rushed forward and fell into me. I instinctively wrapped my arms around her to steady her, and she buried her head in my chest and wrapped me in a fierce embrace.

“I finally found you!” she said into my chest. “It took twenty years, but I found you! I’ve missed you so much!”

I finally regained my composure and disengaged myself from her passionate embrace. I held her out at arm’s length. “Jessica?” I repeated. “Why are you here? What do you mean you finally found me?”

She smiled a perfect smile filled with pure joy. “I’m here for you silly!” she replied girlishly. “Ever since you moved away, I’ve been searching for you. It took twenty years, but I finally found you. Now we never have to be apart again!”

It took a moment for her words to sink in. My stunned brain stubbornly refusing to work at its normal pace. “Did you say that you’ve been searching for me for the last twenty years?” I asked. “Why?”

She giggled playfully, and it sounded like music playing through the leaves on a warm spring day. “Because you’re my husband!” She said happily. “We’re supposed to be together forever! And-“ her tone and expression suddenly became sharp. “Who is *that?*” she demanded, staring angrily at the house behind me.

I turned to look at who she was glaring at.  My wife was standing in the back door, watching us curiously through the glass.  “Oh,” I replied dumbly. “That’s Tasha. My wife.”

“WHAT?” Jessica shrieked. Her voice was filled with rage and disbelief. “You have another wife? You betrayed me!”

I was stunned, again. The situation was simply too much for me to process. “Huh?” I said lamely, not being able to bring anything more intelligent to mind.

The anger flashing in those emerald eyes was like nothing I had ever seen before. My brain finally kicked in, and I said “Wait! Why don’t you come inside, and we’ll talk?”

She glared at me and nodded her head, obviously restraining herself. I led her to the back door and ushered her inside.

“Honey,” Tasha asked with a note of concern in her voice. “Who’s this?”

“Let’s all sit down at the table and then we’ll talk,” I said without slowing down.

\*

“You’re telling me this is the girl you told me about when we first got married?” Tasha asked with a mix of excitement and concern. “Your best friend when you lived here as a kid?”

“And his wife!” Jessica interjected vehemently. “We exchanged our vows in the enchanted glade with the animals and trees as our witnesses!”

My head was swimming and hurting trying to process what was happening. “Jessica,” I said softly, “We were kids, like six years old. It was a game. Even if it wasn’t, we were too young to know what we were doing, and it’s not actually binding. You have to be eighteen to get married in this state.”

Jessica stared at me with a blend of pain and anger. “Not legal?” she demanded. “What do human lawns have to do with sacred vows exchanged willingly?”

Tasha held up her hands in a placating gesture. “I see that you took it seriously,” she said, the calm in her voice barely masking what I knew to be rising anger at this intruder claiming that her marriage to me was illegitimate. “But Andrew’s right. Nothing you did can be legally recognized. Our marriage, on the other hand, was entered into as consenting adults, and we’ve been husband wife, *legally*, husband and wife, for ten years. We have three wonderful children together and plan to have more. I understand that you hoped for more, but this is the way things are. You need to accept it.”

Jessica glared daggers at my wife, and if looks could kill, I’m certain Tasha would have dropped dead on the spot. “Why should I care what your laws say?” she demanded. “He married me first. That makes him *my* husband. Your marriage is not real. It’s a sham. You’ve had your fun playing at being his wife for ten years. Now it’s time for Andrew to do the right thing and honor the vows we exchanged. He’s mine.”

My head swam at these words. I simply could not comprehend how anyone could take something from early childhood as real and binding. “You can’t possibly mean that,” I said slowly, trying to get my thoughts in order as I spoke. “You were my best friend back then, but that was it. Sure, I loved the time we spent playing together, but that’s all it was. Two kids at play. It’s a cherished memory for me, but in the end that’s all it is.”

Jessica stood up abruptly and slammed her palm on the table. “That’s not all it is!” She insisted. “My love for was real! It is real! And I’ve been faithful to you this whole time! I’ve spent my life trying to find you ever since you left, and now that I’ve found you, I don’t intend to let you go!”

My wife had enough at this. She stood up, pointed to the door, and declared “You need to leave! Now!” She stamped her foot hard to emphasize her point. “You come into my house and disrespect my marriage, my family? You tell me that my husband isn’t really mine? Get out! Get out and never come back!”

Jessica’s beautiful features clouded with a seething rage. She looked at me and opened her mouth to speak, but I spoke up before she could utter a word.

“Listen to my wife,” I said firmly.

Jessica’s features brightened for a moment, thinking that I was speaking for her instead of to her.

“You need leave our house,” I continued. “Move on. Find a man of your own. Just leave my family alone.”

Jessica realized that I was siding with Tasha instead of her, and her countenance twisted in rage.

“Fine!” she shouted. “I’ll leave for now. Enjoy your fake family while you have it, but I will have what’s mine!”

She whirled on her heels and walked out of the house with a speed and grace Unmatched in my experience. I couldn’t help but admire it even as I was aghast at her demands and the way she had insulted my family. Something inside me knew that if my parents had never taken me away from this town that Jessica would never have had to see me with anyone else, but that’s not how life worked out. The way things were, I saw my once-best-friend in a new light. I pitied her, and I regretted having met her again.

“What’s wrong with you?” Tasha demanded, interrupting my thoughts.

I was confused. “What do you mean?”

My wife looked at me with a anger I’d never seen in her before. “What do I mean?” she mocked. “You stood there staring like a moron and didn’t defend your family from that crazy lady!” she accused. “You stood by and made me defend our family. You’re supposed to be the one protecting us! Not just from random strangers, but especially from nutty broads who want to destroy our family like her! You didn’t do it! Did you like having her call you her husband? Do you want her?”

I was overwhelmed by my wife’s assault, and my brain short circuited.

“W . . . w . . . what?” I stammered. “You think I . . . I liked . . . me and her? Huh?”

Tasha fixed me with a glare filled with more anger than I knew she was capable of. “I’m going to have the kids spend the night in our room with me tonight,” she declared. “You can sleep in the boy’s room, or on the couch, but don’t bother coming to our bed tonight.

“Babe,’ I protested.

“Don’t ‘Babe’ me!” she cut me off. “I’ve never been so hurt by you before. Now, I’m going to take the kids out for dinner and maybe someplace fun afterward. You stay here and think about what you did wrong today. I’ll sort out my feelings and calm down so we can deal with this like adults tomorrow instead of fighting about it today.”

Even when she was angry, my wife knew the best way to deal with tough situations. The wisdom in her plan was obvious. I nodded. “Okay,” I agreed. “Let’s do that.”

\*

Tasha took the children out without letting them know that she was doing it because she was angry with me. As far as they saw, all was smiles and happiness, and dad was just staying behind to get some work done. It was a good thing. No need to bring the children into adult problems.

I was fully aware of what I did wrong. I stayed silent as another woman told my wife that our marriage was illegitimate. I allowed another woman to attack our relationship, and I left it to my wife to put an end to it.

I waved goodbye to my family as they left for an evening of fun, and then I closed the door. “Stupid!” I chided myself. “Why did I stay silent? Why did my brain freeze up like that?”

I went into the kitchen, opened the fridge, pulled out a bottle of beer, twisted off the cap, took a drink, and closed the door. Turning around, I noticed that there were some dirty dishes in the sink. “No sense being useless and moping around doing nothing,” I said to myself, and went to work washing the dishes.

I finished my beer as I finished drying and putting away the last dish. Feeling a bit better, I threw out the empty bottle and retrieved a fresh beer. I needed some fresh air to clear my head and think. I stepped out onto the back yard deck and surveyed the land before me.

The back yard was cleared for a full acre. It had a large children’s playset, one big old oak tree with a treehouse that the previous owners had built, a sand pit, and a section of large garden boxes where my wife planned to plant flowers and vegetables as soon as the threat of a late frost passed, which it had, but she just hadn’t quite had the time just yet. Maybe next week.

At the sides of the cleared area were small orchards of fruit trees, mostly apples, pears, and cherries, plus areas of blueberry, gooseberry, and raspberry bushes at the back end of the property, the forest began. We owned the first acre of it, but any deeper and it was public land. It was a nice setup, five acres in total when you count the front and sides. So much more than anyone could hope to afford in a big city, and so much healthier for the children than city streets and back alleys could ever hope to be.

The sun was starting to get low as I mused over how fortunate I was to have my family, and to have my job that allowed me to provide for them so abundantly. I finished my beer and sat down to watch the wind in the trees, budding branches swaying gently as the sun approached horizon when I noticed a newly familiar figure emerge from the forest.

I squinted my eyes in disbelief. “It can’t be,” I murmured. “No way she’d just come back like this.”

But I was wrong. So very, very wrong.

Jessica strode right up to the deck as bold, graceful, and beautiful as can be, and smiled at me. “I finally have you alone,” she said happily.

I arched one eyebrow and side-eyed her. “Why does that matter?” I asked suspiciously.

She laughed, genuinely, as though my suspicion and caution meant nothing. “Because now you can be honest with me. No need to pretend in front of that woman who thinks she’s your wife, or those children. I understand that you don’t want to hurt them, but you really should just tell them the truth.”

“The truth?” I repeated sharply. “And what truth do you think I need to tell them?”

She smiled widely and fixed me with a loving gaze. “That they had their fun, but now it’s time for you to be with your real wife and start your real family, of course,” she said as though she truly believed it, and it brought her joy to speak aloud.

I closed my eyes, put my head in one hand and rubbed my temples in between my thumb and fingertips. “And why, pray tell, would I tell them that?” I sighed.

“Because it’s the truth,” she replied brightly.

I raised my head and looked Jessica in the eyes with a fixed stare. “No,” stated firmly. “It’s not. Tasha is my wife, my one, only, and true wife. You were my best friend as a child. We played a game. We made childish promises. If my parents didn’t move us away, who knows what might have followed, but move we did, and this is my life now. With them. Not you. I’m sorry if you wasted your life waiting for me based on a child’s game, but you need to accept it for what it truly was and move on. Go. Find happiness. Just not with me.”

Jessica’s eyes darkened at this, and her lovely smile turned to a frown that should have been ugly, but instead only seemed to demonstrate that she couldn’t look ugly even if she tried. The wind picked up, blowing hard through the trees and making the woods creak and groan, and the very sunlight seemed to dim with her fury.

“How dare you speak such wickedness!” she fumed. She didn’t raise her voice, but that didn’t stop it from sounding ominous, powerful, and terrible. “You deny your vows made before the spirits of the forest? Before the spirits of my ancestors and my family?”

There was an undeniable menace in the air, and my brain wanted to freeze up again, but I willed it to function. “You need to leave,” I commanded without nearly as much authority as I would have liked. “Don’t come back. Leave me and my family alone. I don’t want to see you again.”

Jessica’s visage darkened, and a sudden rush of wind blew through the area. I could hear loud cracks and snaps as it broke limbs from trees in the distance. It caught me powerfully enough to tip me in my chair, and only some fast footwork prevented me from being blown over.

Jessica though, was unmoved save for her long hair blowing sideways in the wind until the gust died down to the breeze it had been when I first sat down. Somehow, her hair actually settled back into its neat, flowing locks rather than being blown into a frizzled tangle.

“The spirits of the forest are not pleased,” she declared ominously. “You *will* honor your vows, or they will make you.”

She didn’t wait for a reply. She turned and strode off toward the wood line, vanishing quickly once she entered the woods. The winds died down, and the light brightened back to normal.

I looked to the skies and didn’t see any clouds. Nothing that could have passed in front of the sun and dimmed it. Thinking the light change must have been an illusion my own mind concocted out of stress, I lowered my gaze and noticed a buck standing at the edge of the woods staring at me. I recognized it as the deer I saw when my children led me to the forest glade where I once spent my days with Jessica.

I raised my empty beer bottle in salute, and the buck snorted before walking into the forest.

I was glad when I went back inside the house. I had resolved that I would take proper legal measures if Jessica insisted on bothering me or my family after being told to leave us alone. I would tell my wife, my beloved Tasha, what happened while she was out with the kids, spend the night on the couch, and listen to her tomorrow when she was ready to talk things through. This wasn’t our first fight. No married couple is without occasional conflict, and we were no exception. But we worked through or conflicts with ease every time. We just took time to get our heads straight, then came together with the goal of resolving the conflict rather than winning the argument.

My cell phone rang. It was Tasha.

“Hey babe,” I said as I picked up the call. “How’d things go?”

Tasha was crying. “You need to come to the hospital right now!” she insisted. “There’s been an accident.”

\*

I rushed to the hospital and burst into the ER in a frenzy. “Tasha!” I yelled.

“Here!” my wife called out from the other end, near the doors to the treatment rooms.

I rushed and wrapped her in my arms. “I’m so glad you’re okay. Where are the kids?”

She hugged me back tightly for a moment before pulling away. “This way,” she said as she took my hand to lead me to the exam room they were in.

Once in the exam room, I checked my family and noted that they all had cuts and bruises, but otherwise appeared to be fine. “What did the doctor say? Does anyone have anything broken? De we need to get you MRI’s?”

“Slow down,” Tasha told me gently. “Everyone’s already been examined. We’re waiting on some x-rays, but no one was seriously hurt. We’re just banged up is all.”

“How did this happen?” I asked.

“It was the strangest thing,” Tasha replied. “We were driving home after dinner and some play time at the park when a massive gust of wind blew through. It shook the car and actually pushed us a bit out of our lane, but that isn’t what caused the accident. The accident was a big tree with a long, thick branch that stuck out over the road broke in the wind. It snapped the branch right off the tree and it landed on the car. It crushed the hood right below the windshield and rolled up a bit. We were all thrown forward into our seatbelts and sprayed with glass. Francis got a gash on his leg where the dash caved in, but he wasn’t pinned and the leg isn’t broken. We’ll know if there’s anything else we need to know once the x-rays come back.”

I took a couple of breaths as I processed what my wife told me. A powerful gust of wind meant it was the same wind that blasted through the woods and home when I told Jessica to leave and never return. “It has to be a coincidence,” I thought out loud.

“What has to be a coincidence?” Tasha asked astutely.

“I’ll tell you all about it when we get home,” I promised. “Right now, let’s just focus on making sure everyone really is okay.”

\*

The X-rays came back clean, and everyone was able to go home without being admitted to the hospital or needing additional treatment. We spent the whole ride home talking about how lucky everyone was not to be seriously hurt in the freak accident, and how the county needs to trim the trees so they don’t endanger drivers with heavy limbs over the road. Once home, we got the kids settled down and put to bed in our bedroom.

Once we were alone downstairs, Tasha brought up my comment at the hospital. “What did you mean about it not being a coincidence?” she asked.

I spilled my guts. I told her everything that happened while she was away, down to the last detail. “It was so strange, almost frightening the way that the sun and wind seemed to respond to her mood,” I concluded. “I know that they can’t be connected, but the timing was just so . . . perfect, and then that same wind caused a tree branch to fall and almost kill you and the kids! If I didn’t know better, I’d think there was some kind of magic involved, but that’s just not possible.”

“So, you stood up for your family and told her to go away forever?” Tasha asked.

“Of course I did babe. I love you! I love the kids! I love our family! I wouldn’t give any of you up for the whole world!”

My wife smiled at this. “Now that you’ve done the right thing, I believe you,” she said sincerely. “I was so worried when that woman was in our house earlier. You have a shared history, and you obviously were fond of each other, and she’s . . . she’s so beautiful. She could turn the head of any man, and after three children, I’m not the woman I was when we got married. Not anymore.”

“Oh babe,” I protested. “You think I care that you’ve matured in the last ten years? Yes, you’ve changed, but you’re only more beautiful than you were back then. You’ve given me three wonderful children, with who knows how many more to come. And yes, that changes a woman’s body, but those changes are the marks of the greatest blessing a woman can give her husband. I see how you’ve changed, and I love you more because of what they mean, and because we have a decade of marriage where we have managed to make each other happy and remain steadfast in our love and dedication. No other woman, no matter her appearance, can ever be as beautiful in my eyes as you are. None. Not ever.”

Tears appeared in her eyes just then, and she stepped in for another hug. We embraced tenderly and exchanged words of love and devotion. She kissed me passionately, and when it was over she asked me a simple question.

“What will you do is that woman shows up here again?”

“That’s easy, my love,” I replied confidently. “I’m going to call the police and report her for stalking and harassment.”

She smiled. “You don’t have to sleep on the couch if you don’t want to,” she said sweetly. “You can join me and the kids in our bed.”

I smiled back and kissed her. “I think I’ll do that.”

\*

The next month went by smoothly. Everyone healed from the accident. We bought a new car with the insurance money. And everything went normally with one minor change. The buck was spending a lot of time around our house. I often saw it in the wood line or foraging among the fruit trees and berry bushes. Oddly, no one ever saw it during my work hours. It seemed to only appear when I was home outside of normal business hours.

My wife managed to weed the garden beds and plant flower and vegetable seeds, and from the number of sprouts, it looked like there would be abundant blooms through the spring and summer, and a bumper crop in the fall. The trees filled with leaves as the last traces of winter passed into memory. There was no sign of Jessica. Life was good.

My children played in the woods of my youth every chance they got. They made friends and brought them to play in the woods. They asked me to explore with them regularly, but most times I had too much to do around the house. Most times, but not all.

One day I was able to join them, and we went back to the lush glen. I saw the buck again, which wasn’t unusual. It seemed to have a fascination with me and my family and managed to be around whenever we were outside. This time it seemed to pace us off to the side, staying well out of reach as usual. The kids decided to try to pet it, but with every step they took toward it, it took two steps away.

“Come back!” I called out when they were as far away from me as I was willing to allow. “It’s a wild animal. It’s not going to let you pet it!”

The kids came running back to me, laughing and playing the whole way. They were happy, and I was happy to be there to share it with them. As they ran back though, I noticed that the demeanor of the buck had changed. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, but something about the way it was standing and looking at me seemed somehow . . . offended. I shook my head, silently chiding myself for thinking such silly nonsense.

The deer bounded off, heading deeper into the glen, but not before staring me right in the eyes for a few uncomfortable seconds.

With the kids gathered around me again, we continued our trek, and found ourselves back in the spot we went to the first time I joined them in the woods. It truly was a place of special beauty. Even as an adult I could understand why Jessica and I had thought it to be magical when we were children. It was more full of life than any other place I had ever been. It smelled of earth and sweet vegetation, and it had an aura of peace that seemed to permeate to my soul.

“What happened to the tree daddy?” Lisa asked.

“Huh?” I replied lamely.

“Daddy, look,” Lisa said as she pointed to a spot in the woods.

The deer was there, having decided to rejoin us, but where I remembered a mature willow tree there was nothing but churned ground. It looked like the tree had been pulled up by the roots, but it wasn’t lying on the ground, or indeed, anywhere to be seen.

“Where’d it go?” asked Brad.

“I have no idea,” I said confusedly. “There’s no sign of it falling over, and no sign of any equipment large enough to haul a whole tree off having been here. What could have happened to it?”

“Maybe it got up and walked away,” said a familiar voice from behind.

Startled, I quickly turned and saw nothing for a moment, but then a familiar form stepped out from behind a stout oak tree.

“Jessica?” I said, surprised. “What are you doing here?”

She gave me an apprising look. “I’m here because, unlike you, I never left,” she answered. “This is my home. It always had been.”

“Not this again,” I grumbled. “I get it,” I stated firmly. “I moved away and moved on. You stayed, and you never moved on. But you need to move on.”

Jessica frowned, and as her lovely features twisted, it felt as though a shadow began to creep over the forest. “It’s not in the nature of my family to move away or move on. We put down roots and stay. Physically, and emotionally.”

She gave me a wrathful look that chilled me to my core, and felt my anger and annoyance change to an inexplicable fear. "Nature does not approve of you rejecting me," she said angrily, and it felt as though her words carried some fel power that radiated outward.

There was thump behind me, and I heard Francis cry out in shock and pain. I turned and saw the buck standing over him, head down and pawing the ground aggressively. “Get away!” I screamed and charged forward to rescue my child from the suddenly angry wild animal.

It turned its head and looked at me. No. Past me, then it backed off and bounded off into the trees and out of sight.

I reached my son and scooped him up in my arms. “Are you okay?” I asked with great concern.

He was shaking like a leaf, and he buried his head in my chest before nodding and saying something that came out as a muffled “Mph!” Brad and Lisa were there, concernedly asking their brother what happened, was he alright, did he need a doctor, and other questions.

“Let’s go home now,” I decided, and none of the children objected. A wild animal attack definitely robbed the day of fun for everyone. “Jess-“ I started to call out, but stopped when I noticed she was already gone. Wondering how she could disappear so completely so quickly, I led my children out of the forest and back to our home.

The forest suddenly felt gloomy and foreboding, as if nature itself were somehow displeased with us. Clouds rolled in to block the sun, and soon the forest almost as dark as night. Birds called out angrily, sounding for all the world as though they wanted to harm me and my kids. We could hear the sound of larger animals rustling in the woods around us.

As if that wasn’t bad enough, Brad suddenly cried out in fear and disgust. “A spider!” he shouted as he swatted a diminutive arachnid floating at the end of a silken thread out of his face.

“EEK!” Lisa screamed, and I saw several more spiders dropping down around her.

Then I saw many, many more spiders. They were dropping down from the trees. Floating in on the wind. They were everywhere, legions of them, of every variety. It was a literal spider rain.

“Run home!” I shouted, and the two children I wasn’t carrying obediently sped off in the direction of home. I ran close behind them, partly because I was slowed by carrying Francis, but mostly to keep eyes on my other children and make sure they got home safely.

I heard a predatory growl from the right side and saw a set of feline eyes glowing in the cloudy darkness. Something large crashed to my left. The children screamed. I screamed. We ran as fast as we could, desperately trying to outpace whatever creatures were dogging our steps and escape the suddenly hostile woods.

We burst out of the woods and into our backyard, but we didn’t slow down until we got to the door and threw ourselves inside before slamming it shut behind us and swatting off the many spiders that had landed on us and hitched a ride.

I just set Francis down to go in the house when I felt something hit me hard from the side. It was that damn deer. It knocked me over, reared up on it’s hind legs, then brought his front hooves crashing down on me. He stomped me over and over again until a faint whistle could be heard in the distance. He stopped, glared at me, snorted, and trotted off to the forest.

I painfully rolled and sat up, feeling like I must have had multiple cracked ribs. I watched as the deer entered the wood line, I could have sworn I saw a faint female form deep in the woods.
