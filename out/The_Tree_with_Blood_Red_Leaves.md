The gnarled tree stood leafless in the otherwise live forest. But it didn't always look this way. One day the ground was empty and bare, and the next, this monstrosity of nature stood at full height, adorned with [blood red leaves.](https://www.reddit.com/user/tropical_rabbit/comments/11m2vpf/the_tree_with_blood_red_leaves/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) At least that's what my friend Chrissy had thought.

Chrissy and I had been friends since elementary school when she moved in next door to me. We quickly became friends through our shared love of the outdoors and telling scary stories. Everyone always thought that we would end up together, but there were never any romantic feelings between us. She was like a sister to me and I was like a brother to her.

We lived in a small town about an hour or so away from Mt. Pleasant. There weren't many stores or restaurants, but there was a lot of farmland and woods. Our summers were spent hiking through the woods and building forts with downed trees and broken branches. In the fall we would go apple picking and venture through corn mazes. Chrissy loved watching the leaves change colors and always had an interest in nature. Most of our classmates moved away after graduation, but she and I stayed. I worked at my parents' bookstore and eventually inherited it when they sadly passed away. Chrissy started a landscaping company and became an expert arborist. We would meet for lunch regularly and go for hikes in the woods, reminiscing about our childhood adventures. 

One day, while I was looking for new books to order, I heard the bell chime from the door to my shop. It was Chrissy. I quickly noticed something was wrong when she didn't have the usual smile on her face. 

"Hey, what's wrong?" I asked before she said anything. I hadn't seen her in about a week, which was a long time for us.

"I'm not quite sure," she said. "Have you seen Mr. Roberts lately?"

Mr. Roberts was the pharmacist at the drug store in town. He would come in every so often for some children's books for his grandkids, but I hadn't seen him in a while.

"Not recently," I said.

"I went in to get the prescription for my mom and he was just standing there, not moving at all. It caught me off guard so I waited for a minute and then called to him when he still didn't move. He turned and glared at me and then yelled at me to leave him alone. I was speechless because he's always been so kind and friendly." 

"Wow, that's crazy," I said. "What did you do?"

"He apologized and said he hadn't been sleeping well. Then he got the medicine and handed it to me without saying anything else. Something was definitely off in his face…he had this really sad look and I almost said something but he walked away from the counter."

While she was telling me more about what happened, the phone rang. It was Gary's mom. She said he wouldn't be in today. Gary was a high school student that helped me in the bookstore a few days a week. I told her that I hope he feels better soon and hung up.

"That's not the only weird thing that has happened," she said. "My crew had just started cutting the grass at one of our customer's houses when he chased them away with hedge clippers. They told me he was yelling incoherently at them. When they got in the truck, they called the police while they drove away. They went back for the equipment when they saw the police car coming."

"Wow, I'm glad your workers didn't get hurt," I said. "What happened to your customer?"

"I don't think they caught him yet, he must've run away before the police car got there," she said.

"I hope they catch him," I said. 

"Me too," she said. "I'm thinking about going for a walk in the park to destress a bit…want to come with me?"

"I really need to finish this new order of books and I don't have Gary's help today so I'll have to pass," I said.

"No worries, I'll catch you next time," she said before turning around and heading out the door.

I went back to my book order, restocked some shelves, and helped a few customers before it was closing time.

After straightening up the store and shutting off the lights, I went out into the cold winter night, locking the door behind me. My store was just at the edge of the small downtown area, which was never very busy during the winter months. In the summer and fall though, we'd get some tourists and there would be a lot more activity at night.

I walked around back to the parking lot, where only my car was parked. It had been a mild winter so far, but tonight, the air was freezing. My eyes watered as I made my way to my car. I got in, started it up, and turned the heat on full blast. I'd probably be home anyway before it got warm.

My headlights illuminated the empty field behind the parking lot and I slammed on the brakes as I turned. I saw something out in the middle of the field. I figured it was probably just an animal but I wanted to be sure. Putting the car in reverse, I watched as the lights moved across the field as I turned. I stopped again when I saw it. There was a man standing there with no clothes. It was fifteen degrees out and with the wind-chill, it had to be in the negatives.

I called 9-1-1 and told them about the man and where I was. While I waited for the ambulance and police, I got out of my car and yelled to the man. He turned his head to look at me for a moment before turning back and facing the woods at the end of the field.

The police car was the first to arrive. I told the officer that I was leaving work and found him standing out there. She grabbed a blanket from her car and started walking towards the man. 

"Sir, are you all right?" she yelled. When he didn't respond, she shouted again to him. "I'm going to help you. Can you please come over here?" 

The ambulance pulled in next and drove through the parking lot and out into the field closer to the man. 

The officer stopped a few feet away from the man and began talking to him in a calm voice. I couldn't tell what she was saying, but I could tell that the man was still looking away from her. She wrapped the blanket around his shoulders while the EMTs got the stretcher out of the back of the ambulance. 

One of the EMTs took the man's arm and tried to pull him toward the stretcher.

The man threw the towel off and shouted, "No, no, no! I have to stay here! It won't let me leave! I can't go!"

"Get the sedative," one of the EMTs shouted. 

The other one ran back to the ambulance and then returned back with the others. The three of them worked together to get the man on the stretcher. With a lot of effort, they were able to strap him into it while he continued to scream and shout. 

After they finally got him loaded in the ambulance, they took off with their lights flashing and sirens blaring.

I waited for the officer to return back to her car. "Do you think he'll be okay?" I asked.

"He was in pretty bad shape," she said, shaking her head. "Thanks for calling this in."

"No problem," I said and got into my car and drove home.

The next morning, I stopped in the drug store for some snacks to keep at work. No one was at the front register, but I heard yelling coming from the back of the store where the pharmacy was located. 

I walked down the make-up aisle toward the source of the yelling. Mr. Roberts was shouting at the cashier, Jenna, who was crying. When Mr. Roberts noticed me, he stopped and walked through the door in the back of the pharmacy and out of sight.

"What happened?" I asked her.

"I don't know," she said as she wiped the tears from her eyes. "All I did was ask him who was coming in today. He makes the schedule and usually lets me know who is working  I've never seen him like that."

"My friend said he was mean to her the other day too. I wonder what is going on with him," I said. "Maybe you should talk to your manager when she comes in."

"I think I will," she said. "I'll just stay away from him until my shift is over."

She walked back toward the front and I was about to go to the snack aisle when I heard a door open. I turned around to see Mr. Roberts walking back into the pharmacy area with a smile on his face.

"Good morning, Ken," he said to me.

"Good morning…is everything okay?" I asked.

"It is a beautiful day," he said. "Do you need anything?"

"Uh, no thanks," I said, surprised by his quick change in demeanor.

"Have a great day," he said.

I hesitated for a moment before saying, "Don't you think you should apologize to Jenna?"

He was an older man, but he was an intimidating figure…plus the pharmacy was a step up from the floor I was standing on, making him look like he was towering over me. However, I still felt I had to say something.

He took a step closer and his smile went away as he glared at me. "Have a great day," he said.

I didn't think it would help to try and say anything else so I walked over to the snack aisle. I turned back before I went down the aisle and saw that he was still glaring at me.

I paid for my snacks and wished Jenna good luck on getting through the day.

It was a slow Sunday at the bookstore so I wasn't concerned when Gary's mom called in sick for him again. It was a short day anyway with closing time being at five o'clock.

I heard sirens a few times during the day and saw flashing lights speed by my windows. There was the occasional emergency around here, but it was odd to have three in a short time frame. 

Just before closing time, Chrissy came through the door. 

"Hey Chrissy," I said. "Do you want to grab a bite at the Village after I close up?"

"Yeah, that sounds good," she said, her voice sounding tired and without the usual pep.

"Are you alright?" I asked.

"Yeah…I'm fine. I just didn't sleep well last night," she said.

The door opened behind us and Chrissy jumped and appeared startled.

It was the police officer from last night. 

"How can I help you?" I asked.

"I was wondering if you knew who that man was last night. He had no ID or any belongings near him and we don't know who he is."

"I didn't really get a good look at him so I'm not sure," I said.

"It isn't looking too good for him and he isn't able to communicate. The frostbite is severe and they are not sure if he's going to make it so we'd like to notify his family," she said. "I'm going to search around our back to see if he left his clothes or anything nearby."

"Good luck," I said.

I followed her to the door and locked it after she left.

When I turned around, Chrissy was standing there with her mouth hung open and her eyes wide. "What happened?" Chrissy asked.

"There was someone out back last night. I noticed him when I was driving through the parking lot. I tried to get his attention but he wouldn't move so I called 9-1-1," I said.

"And he had nothing on? It was freezing last night…and so windy!" she said.

"Nothing at all and they had to force him in the ambulance. He was yelling something about not being able to leave," I said.

"We can't leave," she said.

"What do you mean?" I asked.

She stared off for a moment and mumbled something before saying, "Oh, nothing…it's nothing. Let's just go get a bite to eat."

She still had this weird look on her face, but didn't seem to want to talk at the moment.

We closed up the shop together and then walked the two blocks to the Village Cafe. There were a few tables full, but it wasn't too busy overall.

"Hey Chrissy and Ken, sit wherever you'd like and I'll be right with you," said Emily as she delivered plates of food to one of her tables.

"Take your time," said Chrissy.

We went to a booth by the front windows and sat down. Neither of us needed to look at a menu; we knew it by heart. There weren't many restaurant options in town. I ordered the fish and chips and Chrissy just got a cup of broccoli cheese soup and a decaf coffee.

"I'm not that hungry," she said.

"You've got me worried," I said. "What's going on?"

She took a big drink of water and then said, "Last night I dreamt of something similar to what happened to you yesterday."

"With the naked man?" I asked.

"Yes, but it didn't happen the same way," she said. 

Emily came back and dropped off the coffee. "Your food will be up shortly," she said with a smile.

"Thank you," said Chrissy.

She added some cream and sugar, stirred it up, and then took a sip before telling me about her dream.

"I was walking through the woods and kept hearing whispers all around me. It was night but still bright out from the moon. I heard someone talking and came across a naked man. He was talking loudly but I couldn't understand any of the words he was saying. When he turned to face me, his nose was missing and his skin was pale and white. Then he said that it wants something from us and we cannot leave. Then he went back to his unintelligible ramblings."

"Wow, that is weird," I said. "Did you wake up after that?"

"No," she said as she stirred her coffee some more. "I saw something glowing nearby through the bushes and was drawn to it. It was a lot like the strange tree I saw yesterday on my walk, but seemed more alive. The leaves were blood red and let off a soft glow and the branches and exposed roots slithered slowly like snakes."

"You saw that tree yesterday? With red leaves?" I asked.

Emily came by again with our food and a refill of coffee. "Enjoy," she said. "Let me know if you need anything else."

"Thank you," I said.

I wasn't ready to eat yet, I was enthralled by her story.

"Yes. I went on my usual walk through the trail in the woods but veered off somewhere without even realizing it. I eventually came to this tree with bright red leaves. It stood out because, of course, all the other trees lost their leaves a few months ago." She continued to sip on her coffee, but neither of us ate.

Emily walked over again, "How is every…oh, looks like you haven't even tried it yet. You must be having a juicy conversation." She leaned over the table and whispered, "Is it about Mr. Roberts?"

"No," I said. "But what happened with him? He's been acting strange lately."

"You're telling me!" she exclaimed. Then she looked around to make sure no one was around and spoke quietly. "He was in this morning by himself and sat at that booth way in the back. Him and his wife are always here together on Sunday mornings. When I asked where the missus was, he said that it was none of my business. I didn't like how it felt when he was looking me in the eyes, he looked so full of hatred. I was caught so off guard, he's been the nicest man ever since I've known him."

"He's been yelling at people in the drugstore too," I said. 

"He also just stared straight the whole time he ate…it just gave me the creeps," she said. "Maybe someone needs to check on them. That's not like him at all."

"That's a good idea," said Chrissy.

"Well, I better get back to my other tables," said Emily. "Let me know if you have any other juicy gossip!"

I finally took a few bites of my fish and Chrissy ate her soup.

When we were finished eating, I wanted to hear more about the tree she found. "What happened when you found the tree? Do you know what kind it was?"

"That's another weird thing about it," she said. It didn't look like any of the trees I've ever seen in Michigan before. It had some characteristics of a black walnut tree, but the leaves were differently shaped and there were no walnuts or shells around the tree."

"And I thought you were the great tree expert," I said, teasing her a little.

She smiled and I'm glad that lightened the mood a bit. "I'm determined to figure it out, though," she said. "I felt like I lost my sense of time when I was looking at it. All of a sudden I was freezing and shivering even though it was a little warmer than usual with the sun out. When I snapped out of whatever it was, I pulled off a leaf so I could research it. To continue with the strangeness of the tree, it was really hard to pull the leaf off. I actually had to use both hands and really pull."

"Did you figure anything out with the leaf yet?" I asked.

"No, I had a headache before going to bed and have been too tired today to look into it," she said. "I'm going to look through my books and online tomorrow to see if I can find anything on it."

"Well, let me know what you find out," I said.

We paid the bill and walked back to our cars at the bookstore. When we got to the parking lot, Chrissy took a few steps past her car and seemed to be staring towards the woods.

"Do you see something out there? Don't tell me it's another naked man," I said.

Chrissy didn't respond and remained still.

"Hey!" I shouted. "Chrissy, are you okay?"

When she still didn't respond, I ran over to her. She was whispering something under her breath that I couldn't make out. 

I grabbed her arm and said, "Chrissy, what are you…"

She turned around to face me, her eyes wide and darting back and forth. "We cannot leave!" she shouted loudly enough to scare some nearby birds into flight.

I grabbed both of her arms and shook her. "Chrissy, what the hell is going on?"

She blinked rapidly a few times before focusing her eyes on me. "I thought I heard something out there," she said, looking back towards the woods. "Did you hear it?"

"All I heard was you whispering and then shouting," I said.

She gave me a weird look. "I wasn't talking," she said. "I was trying to hear if it was talking to me again."

"You don't remember shouting?" I said."Wait, wait, wait…if it talks to you again? What are you talking about?"

She glanced back at the woods before looking back at me. "Nothing. It's nothing. I'm fine," she said in her normal calm voice.

"You don't seem fine," I said.

"I'm just tired from barely sleeping last night. Honest, I'm fine," she said.

"Let me at least take you back to your place. I'll drive you back to your car in the morning," I said.

"You don't need to. I'll be done," she said.

"Hey, you would do the same if it was me acting all strange," I said.

"Alright fine," she relented.

She locked her car and climbed into the passenger seat of mine. We drove in silence to her house. I wanted to know what was going on with her, but she wouldn't open up.

When we got to her house, I walked her inside through the front door, immediately noticing how dark it was in the house. Except for a faint glow coming from the kitchen.

I was about to ask her about it, but she turned on the lights, making the glow disappear. 

 "I'm going to get changed and lie down," she said.

"Do you want me to stay over?" I asked. "I don't mind sleeping on the couch out here."

"That would be nice. It has been a strange couple of days," she said.

Chrissy went to bed and I stayed up for a little while watching TV. Once I started getting tired, I turned off the lights and went over to the couch, but stopped when I saw that glow again. 

I walked into the kitchen and on the counter was the red leaf Chrissy had told me about. It was on a paper towel on top of the counter. It looked smooth and leathery and I had a sudden urge to pick it up and rub it all over my face. I started reaching for it but stopped and jumped when I heard Chrissy behind me.

"Hey, didn't mean to startle you…just getting a drink of water" she said. She saw me looking at the leaf. "It's beautiful isn't it. I wouldn't touch it though. It leaves a red dye on your hands that is hard to wash off."

After she got her water, she went back down the hall to her bedroom. I looked at the leaf for a little while longer, mesmerized by it, before going back to the couch.

I woke up screaming at the top of my lungs and jumped out of the couch, quickly looking around me. It took me a moment, but I was able to calm down once I realized I was safely in Chrissy's house.

I sat back down on the couch and thought about the vivid dream I just had. It started off in Chrissy’s house. In the dream, I woke up and saw the bright glow in the kitchen again. I went in there and the leaf was slowly moving, like waves were going through it. The paper towel was soaked in blood red liquid and it was dripping onto the floor, leaving a huge puddle. I picked up the leaf and rubbed it all over me, feeling the liquid on any exposed skin. I covered my eyes with it and when I let go, I found myself standing in the woods directly in front of the tree that looked exactly like Chrissy had described. Its leaves were glowing a deep, eerie red, and seemed to be moving even though the air around her was still.

There was whispering all around me, but I didn’t see anyone. As I stood there staring at the tree, strange noises began to join the whispers. It was like something was moving through the underbrush, making its way towards me. The sounds were getting closer, and I felt a wave of panic wash over me. The leaves and sticks on the ground moved into the air as if some unseen force was surging through them. Then, all of a sudden, it stopped and I felt a warm blast of air on my face. I closed my eyes and when I opened them again, I was standing in a clearing in the woods. The tree was gone. Raindrops began falling from the sky, leaving red marks on my clothes and body. I looked around and saw an ax on the ground in front of me, the red rain making it look like it was stained with blood.

As I bent over to pick it up, I heard someone yelling behind me. Turning around with the ax in my hands, I saw the naked man I had seen the night before. He was yelling gibberish and his face was deformed from the frostbite. His nose was missing like in Chrissy’s dream and his eyes were wide and wild. I didn’t want to, but I walked over to him with the ax held high. He held out his arms, one ending in a stump and the other missing most of its fingers. I brought the ax done and heard a sickening crunch as it went into his shoulder. The man screamed and continued his yelling but didn’t put up a fight while I continued striking him with the ax until he was a bloody heap on the forest floor. Then I felt a smile form across my lips just before I woke up screaming.

Once I was able to calm down a little, I called out for Chrissy. There was no response so I walked down the hall to her bedroom. The door was wide open and the covers were bunched at the bottom of the bed. She wasn’t there. I called out to her again and began looking around her house. When I got to the front hall, I saw that the front door was partly ajar. My car was still in the driveway and hers was at the bookstore so she had to have taken off on foot. I noticed that the footprints in the snow leading away from the porch looked like they were made from bare feet as there were none of the usual shoe or boot markings.
