A year ago I met a beautiful girl. We dated and she moved in with me. I accept her requests: I will fuck her only when she gets horny, I will pay for her living expenses and our apartment, and I will give her allowance. I cannot text her more than one sentence, and I cannot call more than once a week. She doesn’t always return to our apartment, and she won’t allow me to ask questions that are about her. 

I’ll call her Andie. 

I saw her one night. She was holding her phone and smiling. Something about that smile was eerie, it was a smug grin I never saw on her usually apathetic face and I was surprised she was capable of that expression, too. 

She tugged on my tie that night and clamped me with her legs, kissing me intensely. There was something that feels wrong but I couldn’t stop myself, you know. It’s harder than it sounds. 

I want to know more about her. 

I want to know her. 

*I want her.*

That night as she slept I went through the news. It wasn’t the election. It wasn’t a new drama that started airing. Then, as though by fate, I found a post about a girl who died, reported to be suicide as she most likely fell from a bridge. It was at a strange beach-like area that had no surveillance cameras and I recognized the name of the town. Andie asked me to come to a trip there but I couldn’t due to work. She still booked a double room, and I checked my Airbnb that night. 

The girl who died was Andie’s age and from her college. I couldn't seem to find her Instagram or it was taken down, and Facebook also gave no results either. The news article didn’t state much except a suicide happened at that location. No discrepancies. Yet why, I wonder, I felt as though I knew the answer? 

Andie slept peacefully next to me. During sex she usually clawed my back and slapped me. She liked me wearing a tie so she can pull at it, full of malice, but that night she seemed satisfied and happy. She was soft to the touch and her arms wrapped around me like a hug, most of all, she couldn’t stop tonguing me, again and again, a foreign feeling. 

When Andie woke up I had breakfast ready but the magic had worn off. She takes a bite before getting dressed. 

“Should I make dinner?” I ask. It was one of the few questions Andie deemed appropriate. She shrugged. 

“Just make it. If I don’t eat it you eat it. Eat my breakfast, too.”

I was thinking of the dead girl and the Airbnb but I don’t really ask. I dipped my head and watched her leave before finishing her breakfast, dressed in a blouse she liked, grabbing her fur-trimmed coat and designer bag. The door closed. 

I think I knew. In fact, I think I loved Andie more. That high-could she reach it again? Would she kill someone again and love it and love me again, even for a brief night? 

When Andie returns that night she’s more moody, she wants the bed to herself and at times like that I simply sleep on the sofa. I wake up at the night multiple times hearing her giggle on a phone call. 

“…yeah, she was weak as fuck. I only pushing her, really, she climbed up. What? No, of course I told her to, it was my plan. I even tricked my boy toy…”

Her voice was soft and innocent, like she’s a schoolgirl talking when the teacher isn’t looking. About month from that day, Andie begins to kiss me hard and I get deja vu. She rides me all night and pleasures herself again and again. She hugged me close to her as we slept. 

Her mood was good and I hesitated before I spoke. 

“Im happy you’re happy.”

“You are?” Andie looked into my eyes, then she grinned. “Hey, do something for me.” 

She tiptoes like a swan from our bed and into the desk. She looks before she tosses a pair of serrated scissors at me. 

“Cut yourself. Like, maybe here, on your inner thigh,” she whispered. Her finger in on my flesh and she deliberately slides her finger before she pulled away. “Do it.” 

My erection rose and she falls laughing. 

“Come on,” she goaded me. 

“Okay.” 

I cut myself and did all she directed. It hurt, but the next day Andie gave me all the sex I wanted, allowing me to orally please her. She pulled at my head and made moans. I tried my best and that night I was allowed to sleep next to her. She clung onto me out of habit, and muttered a different name. I was learning more about Andie. 

By early this year, I learned what things brought Andie joy. I crushed cats under my car. I got a gun and Andie took possession of it. We got high and spat at people under our high rise balcony. Weird things I never did. Once, I pushed hard into a lady in front of me. She lectured me and I began to stalk her, Andie watching me. She followed, excited, but the lady quickly ran into a restaurant. 

“You should’ve went in. Imagine her face,” Andie said. The phone calls she made decreased. I knew the most about her. 

I also began to help Andie. She never really told me, but I knew she knew I knew.  

The neighbor next to us was a woman with a child. She complained to us a few times to do certain things more quietly, as she had a child right next to our bedroom. Andie rolled her eyes and I said we would keep that in mind. 

Her mood sucked that day and quickly, she began calling people. She called the person I didn’t know who knew about her killing. She called other people. She dragged me along with her, because a couple always looks less suspicious, and I had money at my disposal as opposed to her using my card all the time. 

I didn’t know how, but Andie found the ex-husband of our neighbor. We were meeting a guy in a restaurant. He seemed like he grew up in a gang, tattooed and scare on his face. I didn’t know at first until he brought up her name. 

“You know June? Where is she? Does she know I’m here?” he thundered.

“Calm down,” I said. 

Andie laughed innocently. “What do you mean? Why, are you two fighting?” 

“She didn’t bat an eye when I had to go to jail right after losing custody.” He muttered a curse before correcting himself. “I just miss my daughter Dani.” 

“Of course you do,” Andie whispered. “It’s not your fault, you know. She’s a bit of a, well, possessive mother, so I’m worried about Dani too!”

“This is great, I’ve tried to find her all this time.” 

“She’s actually our friend, I’m sure I can help you see your daughter again!” Andie lied. 

The man’s eyes glittered. I felt ashamed to be involved in the whole predicament but drove them to our apartment. The man admitted he was in jail due to assault but didn’t mention who. I thought of June, who always seemed a bit scared as she ushered her daughter into their apartment. I saw the man’s eyes on Andie and let it go. 

The man had tea at our place and at night, when June and Dani usually slept, Andie handed the man a knife we never used. I only used my own utensils in the kitchen and Andie never cooked. She held it by the blade before he grabbed it. 

“I think Dani should be with you. June isn’t a good mom…just threaten her with it, okay?” Andie rang the doorbell and I watched. 

We waited before we heard shuffling. “Who is it?” June asked, voice groggy. 

“Sorry, it’s me, Andie!” She covered the peephole with her face. “I need help, please! Please!” 

June didn’t hesitate to open her door to a woman in need but as her eyes adjusted she stepped back. She turned her back and it was all we needed to pull the trigger - her ex husband ran after her into the dark apartment and there were screams. Andie pushed me away, pretending to urgently ask for help and running down the stairs for help. 

I had to play my part as we had cameras in hallways, and I shouted and without Andie to watch over me, pulled the man back as he tugged forwards. 

“Stop it! Don’t you dare!” I screamed as I grabbed for the knife. 

His eyes were full of bloodlust and he stabbed my hand, and I fell back, screaming in pain. June was far away but she ran to me when she saw my hand bleeding, I saw in that instance of June had been my wife, what bliss I would feel. June would be a normal wife, we would put Dani’s happiness above our own. We would fight but neither of us would be violent. Andie and the ex husband were far more suited to one another, but instantly my guilt at imagining such an absurd thing returned. 

I didn’t say anything when the ex-husband stabbed June and I watched. He pulled out the knife and stabbed her again, and it seemed unreal how her blood rained over me, again and again until finally, I stood up. 

Dani stood at her room’s door way and I pushed her up into the room and locked the door and she cried. 

“Why? Why is daddy here? Where’s mommy?” She sobbed in my arms. “Let me go, I don’t like daddy!” 

“Be quiet! He’s going to come in if you make any noise!” 

She saw my bleeding hand and how I struggled to move her desk to the door and she helped, swallowing in cries. If June died, Andie would be happy, but she didn’t care about Dani. 

“Listen carefully, your father threatened us to bring him here and stole our knife. My girlfriend called the police, it’ll be okay.”

And inside, deep inside, unlike killing those cats, I actually regretted what I did. 

That night was over as quickly as it began. Police arrested June’s ex husband and the news didn’t involve us at all. It was reported Dani would be sent to foster care and the ex-husband threatened a couple into letting him into their place. 

Andie and I had animalistic sex, and she was loud, happy at the joy of not having June or Dani live next to us. I couldn’t enjoy it. I don’t remember anything. Andie was fascinated by my injured hand, which never healed properly. People pitied me when they saw my cast. I I unable to use my dominant hand at all. Thank goodness I wasn’t an artist or needed my hand for work, so I adapted quickly to using my left hand to eat and brush my teeth. 

Although Andie obsessed with seeing it and how my stitches looked, then how it looked when the stitches were taken out, then finally, how my skin held up. She told me things, out of nowhere. 

“I have a friend I kill with, I used to call her all the time, but you’ve become more and more like my dream man. We can stay this way. Like, you know, permanently.” 

“Marriage?” I asked. 

“Yeah. It’s time I enjoy being the bitchy bride and wife of a rich man.” 

“I don’t know if my dad is letting my brother or I inherit the company,” I said. I was pushing Andie away. 

Andie looked at my hand, quietly, and I feared she would rip apart my skin. Instead, she licked my fingers, and inhaled in the smell of my wound without bandages. 

“It doesn’t really matter. This hand changed it all. I thought you were spineless, but you can do some nasty stuff. Your thighs are full of cuts. My name is tattooed around your asshole. This hand was injured to make us innocent.”

“I’m not as brave as you think.” 

“I know. But I don’t mind. Because you know you’re worthless. You will always be turned on by me after pleasing me.” 

“Not this this!” I snatched my hand away, and didn’t back away nor lower my head. “She could’ve been my wife! That could’ve been my daughter! Do you even understand what you did? You only saw the chaos after it ended!” 

“Your wife? June?” Andie laughed. 

“I’m serious. When my hand was stabbed, she ran towards me in worry. For a mere stranger! And you, you made that man kill June for entertainment! Like I killed all those cats for you!” 

“Fuck you then,” Andie said. “I thought it might’ve been fun. I thought you might’ve had more guts to do other things, too.”

“No, you don’t need me,” I said. I waited. “Do what you want, then. Kill me. Do what you want.” 

Andie frowned before uttering a noise of disgust. “What? Why would I? I’ll simply leave.” 

“What about the Pre-nup? I’ll have to give you half of my fortune and owe you ten years of monthly payments.” I remembered all the clauses she wrote. 

“Oh, yeah. That. Well, think of it as a farewell gift.” 

She jumped up and starting packing her stuff. She didn’t take any of the luxury items I bought her, her Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, Prada, Versaces, or Hermes. Purses stayed in the walk in closet as well as fur coats, high heels were still in their boxes, and makeup sat at her vanity table. 

“That’s all?” I asked her, confused. “I can maid the rest of your items to your new address at least. Or do you prefer movers?” 

“No, neither.” Andie smiled, and I thought of going back and begging for her to stay. 

I thought if only she had a personality and felt real emotions, we could’ve been amazing together. Our chemistry, my money and her charisma—she was the trophy girlfriend everyone envied. Out of my league. 

“Where are you going? Where are you staying?” I asked. “In a hotel?” 

She tongue me and just as I touched her face she recoiled. Cold air greeted me. 

“You will never know. You’ll never know anything about me anymore.”

And like she always left, without a “Goodbye” or “See you sometime,” she simply pulled her luggage behind her as she left, dressed simply and like any women you encounter. 

Our encounter was like that, too. A girl who liked my same dessert. We happened to both bump into each other at the bookstore. We had a situationship. Then we became official. Then finally, came the boundaries she set that I didn’t want to overstep because she was so fucking perfect. 

Then after that, came the love. 

Be careful if you meet a girl who smiles when you run over an animal. That could be Andie-*your* Andie.
