I (M32) have a loving girlfriend who is 29,  we live together and have been for about 2 years now.  I have known her since she was 28, and soon started dating after.
I couldn't have asked for anyone more perfect in my life.  
She takes care of me, loves me unconditionally, and always has my best interests at heart.  
One day we went a club nearby, since both of us had no work that night. Side note, we both have very busy jobs that require a lot of our time, it often leaves us little to no time for eachother.   When I saw her getting ready, in the bathroom. She was wearing a more revealing dress, it was red and she looked stunning as ever.     The only thing that through me off, was a few bruises around her body.
I first pointed out the obvious question, "is she cheating on me?"  She could see my mind was clouded so she grabbed my face and kissed me, immediately pulling me back to reality.   She asked kindly, "what was up?"  I hesitated but asked about the marks on her body.


She looked and said "I don't see anything?"
I sighed and start speaking "the one right the-" As I looked up at the mirror behind her, they were gone. Gone. I looked back down and there was nothing there anymore. I couldn't but help take a step back from her as I had to ponder the idea, if i was just seeing things, or if there really was marks.
She asked "Hun, what was wrong?"  I shook it off and said "I think I'm just seeing a shadow or something, I won't worry about it."  She nodded and went back to getting ready.
After about 10 more minutes she was ready and we headed out, we arrived at the club and got in rather smoothly, the guy gaurding the door was actually pretty friendly. 
As we're inside, we first got drinks, and hit the dance floor, where things got a little heated between me and her.

  She grabbed my hand and took me outside where we started making out, and she said she had to go grab something from the car.  I waited patiently for her to return when another girl came around, and started flirting with me. I calmly stated I had a girlfriend, and she put her hands on me.  She then started saying things that was more Innapropriate flirting, and I had said to stop and get off me.
She started trying to un-do my shirt and pants, while I yelled stop it.

All of a sudden I saw a black shadow that resembled a human, with white eyes, and black veins leading to the eyes.   No pupils or anything, just white eyes and black veins. It opened its mouth and all I saw was rows of teeth like the clown from the IT movie. The thing yanked on her hair, and lifted her off the ground just based on that alone.  The girl couldn't open her mouth, all you could hear was hums of screams. I passed out from the scene, all I remember was the girl hanging over that monsters mouth, and I assumed I'd be next.

I woke up to my girlfriend shaking me and crying, thinking i was seriously hurt.   The first words I said was, "wheres the girl?"  My girlfriend said, "what girl? You just passed out all of sudden on my way back here." 
That night all I found was her ID, and when reporting it to the police they told me no one ever existed by this ID. 
I cant stop shaking as I write this, because I believe that monster, is my girlfriend.
