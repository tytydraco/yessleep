  
It was a bitterly cold October night on Willow Street when I decided to convince my friends to go on a haunted house adventure. There were many stories in the area about the old, abandoned mansion at the end of the street. The locals called it the “Haunted House,” and no one ever ventured closer than the entrance. But that night I wanted to be brave, so I persuaded Mike, Sarah and Chris to go with me.  
  
The clock read 9:00 p.m. when we set off. The cold wind blew through the leaves of the trees and an eerie howl sounded in the distance. We reached the mansion around 9:30 p.m. It looked just like the stories, with shabby windows and gloomy shadows dancing in the moonlight.  
  
I could see the uncertainty on my friends' faces, but no one wanted to look like a coward. We bravely walked through the creaking gate and entered the building. The musty smell of mold hit us as we entered the dark entrance hall.  
  
The walls were covered in cracks and peeling paint, and the floor creaked under our shoes. We walked further and entered a large living room. Suddenly we heard a strange whisper that seemed to come from everywhere. Hearts racing, we ventured deeper into the house.  
  
We climbed the creaky stairs and entered a bedroom. The bed was rumpled, as if someone had been lying in it. A cold breath brushed our backs and I swore I saw a fleeting movement out of the corner of my eye. The whispers grew louder and more incomprehensible.  
  
Suddenly we heard a dull rumble from above. Chris, who had been the bravest of us so far, said, "Let's go see what that was." We followed him up the stairs and got into the attic. The whispers reached a deafening crescendo.  
  
It was even worse up there. Old furniture and dusty boxes covered the floor. We discovered a rusty typewriter in the corner and pages of confused sentences and dark drawings littered the floor.  
  
Suddenly we heard an eerie, hissing voice that seemed to come from nowhere. "You're not allowed to be here!" She repeated herself and repeated herself until it felt like she was speaking directly into my head.  
  
Panic overwhelmed us and we ran down the stairs, through the dark hallways, and finally outside. The gate slammed behind us and the whispers suddenly stopped.  
  
We stood in the street, panting and our hearts racing. This definitely wasn't your average haunted house. This was something darker, more ancient, trapped in this old mansion.  
  
The clock read 10:30 p.m. when we assured each other that we would never return. Willow Street would forever remain a place of terror in our memories.  
  
That night changed us. We had experienced the horror of Willow Street, and we knew there were things better left unexplored. And as we parted and walked home, I could still hear the whispers in my ears, and I vowed never to go near that cursed house again.
