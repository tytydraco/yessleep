Chief.  
  
Update on that weird suicide in New Albany last week. The kid was working from home all afternoon, data annotation for some AI startup. He watches a video then describes what he sees. There's pages and pages of this stuff, i just pulled it from when it started to get weird until the end.  
  
  
  
  
  
Three smartly dressed people stand on a stage in a bar and sing into microphones. The camera pans over to an appreciative crowd as the video ends.  
  
A smartly dressed coach yells animated encouragement at some young basketball players in a high school gymnasium.  
  
Someone dressed all in white sitting in a monochrome room sings to camera. This is intercut several times with a homeless person being chased by police officers. Upbeat pop music plays throughout.  
  
A first person view of someone walking through the woods, they come upon what looks like a dead horse or cow, it is bloated and decayed, with only holes where the eyes once were, white crawling things, most likely maggots writhe in the sockets. The camera operator screams in mock disgust. Another person laughs out of shot.  
  
Several types of small fish swim around a brightly lit and decorated fish tank. The camera moves to focus on some white tubing at the back of the tank as the camera operator describes it.  
  
Someone wearing a safety visor and protective coat works on a small car's bodywork sending sparks arcing through the air. They are on a small smoky stage and strobe lights flash throughout. Loud, bass heavy music pounds throughout and an audience can be seen in the foreground dancing.  
  
An ornate wooden clock plays a tune on its chimes as small smiling clockwork figures waltz upon it, the camera moves closer and the tune speeds up, the dancing figures aren't laughing, they're screaming. The ticking of its swinging pendulum can be heard throughout.  
  
A band wearing jeans and t-shirts sings and plays guitar on a concert stage. The music is loud but an appreciative crowd can be hear under it. Not maggots. Worms, thousands of white worms.  
  
A teenage pop performer sings emotively to the camera. This is intercut with video of a screaming goat in a grassy field. This goat has eyes but the worms will have them soon enough.  
  
Blurry images of a young person wearing a blue polo shirt in a small bedroom as they turn the camera around to point at a bookshelf. They speak calmly throughout.  
  
Two casually dressed people talk to each other in an exaggerated fashion on a large comedy club stage. An audience can be heard laughing. The camera turns to the audience, they look so happy. I'm never happy.  
  
A person in a camo coat and hat sits nervously upon a large light brown horse as another person wearing a beige jacket and light blue jeans holds the reigns. The camera operator and another unseen person converse quietly. It was a cow, not a horse, huge bloated cow and the worms weren't just in the eyes, it was full of them, tiny white worms.  
  
A bearded person with shoulder length hair talks animatedly to camera. A hand drawn background with several slogans graffitied upon it can also be seen.  
  
A family is silhouetted against a bright blue sky, they hold hands as they walk through a grassy field. I'll never have a family, I'm alone.  
  
Two performers exaggeratedly welcome children over for a photo opportunity, a close up of the child shows them smile, nervously as the performers come in closer for a mimed kiss. Faint background music and conversation can be heard.  
  
A grey and white cat sits on a wooden floor, the cat sits back slightly. A television can be heard in the background. Worms.  
  
A person sits on a stool in a guitar shop trying out guitars. Another person joins them to play a bass. They then walk around the shop in sped up footage. Heavy rock with screamed vocals plays throughout.  
  
A large stadium or open air auditorium seating stand with hundreds of uniformed teenage students upon it. They applaud and cheer as someone out of sight speaks unclearly on a microphone.  
  
A young person wearing a black t-shirt sits in front of a microphone stand and plays melodically on an acoustic guitar.  
  
Someone in black clothing cycles slowly down a dirt track. This fades to several people watching a snake charmer perform, the snake swaying in front of the performer as they perform on their pungi. The man seizes the snake and cuts it open and there's hundreds of white baby snakes inside falling out of it. n0 NOT snakes, worms.  
  
A heavily modified black pickup truck sits on a driveway with the engine revving loudly.  
  
A woman sits at a table, she's so beautiful and she's enjoying a meal and she looks at the camera operator and NO-ONE has ever looked at me like thatbutthenshelooksconfused and she opens her mouth and its thosefuckingwormsandtheykeepcomingandcoming and her eyes fall in and theres worms in there and the camera operator just laughs andlaughsandlaughsand he says THE WORMS WILL HAVE US ALL IN THE END

Worms worms.

Not great, is it? Coroner says wounds were self inflicted. Pushed his thumbs into his eyes and, well, eventually his own brain.  
  
Tox came back with a mix of things, THC (probably from the vape we found) SSRI's, adderall, few other things I've not heard of, he was full of them.  
  
No worms though, lol.  
  
I'll get the full report to you tomorrow.
