  
It’s a new freaking year... great.

I remembered saying this to myself In front of my bathroom mirror.  
 I was so tired both  mentally and emotionally that I was in a desperate need of a break before I lost it. My mental health was not great back then... can’t say the same now... but it's definitely better! there’s that at least.

 It was a rainy day and lockdown was starting to go away meaning the socials, something I call the rotten society we live in, seemed  to finally get a glimpse of life before Covid had started, honestly idk if it was better or for worse, if society was a problem back then... now It just seemed more hostile and violent than it was before.  
 I can’t help but feel numb and frozen at the thought of society and my role in it, it just doesn't surprise me If it is that bad nowadays. People either get smarter or dumber. It's a never-ending cycle, anyways enough of that and my hatred towards society, the names Kith, I’m 18 going 19 and I have no idea why I'm introducing myself to my mirror.

  
Maybe I'm just crazy. 

I find myself doing this often ever since Covid started. My routine consists of  waking up, stretching ,cursing the world and spending hours in the bathroom just staring at myself in the mirror. It just feels like there is always someone there but I only see my reflection,.

they always say not to look for too long in a mirror or it might smile back, but honestly I find myself wishing that my reflection does smile one day even if it is just for a lil ..

  
This is all the stuff I had said  that fucking day... 

  
back then I wanted so much, I was filled with so much hatred for nothing, oh Kith dumb… dumb Kith. 

I still remember how the mirror would fog up and my bathroom light would flicker and how hot the mirror felt even though it was cold.  
 I remember how I felt as I realized that I couldn’t breathe once I rested my hand on that cold reflective panel ..I remember it all, I remember how that hot steamed mirror smiled back at me .. 

who would've known what so much hatred can cause to manifest..

  
 That day within seconds of staring at myself in that damn mirror, I felt my soul get ripped up and my eyes bulge, I gasped for air for hours yet I couldn’t pull away. You see right where my hand was resting, was a frail skinny hand holding my wrist down against the panel and no matter how much I pulled  it wouldn’t let go. My ears were screaming with shrieked whispers and the only thing that made the sound  stop was the blood that dripped out of them, the blood felt warm and thick as it poured down my neck, I became pale. 

My nose started to do the same, then my eyes, then  my teeth gums and just every single pore that existed on my body, I could barely hold myself up ,I felt so weak ,it felt as if the devil itself was staring back into my soul and punishing me for having so much hate..

 I felt as another arm pulled me closer to the mirror.

  
This one cupped my face ,it felt cold, I couldn’t do much, all I could do was just watch myself as I bleed all over the bathroom floor and sink , my hair was damped and the smell of rotten iron was suffocating, every time I took a gasped breath I would swallow so much blood.

  
I looked back at the mirror and there in its shadow I saw, the black smoked face of something that wasn’t even human ,it looked so ghostly and tall, it was trying to mimic how I looked ,and by what I could tell he was doing a perfect job. Except for whatever this thing was..it didn’t have eyes just two empty sockets filled with smoke and maggots.. 

I must have stared too long cause what felt like hours was just minutes, and in the moment that he had cupped my face, the tall figure reached up and stuck his thumb into my own eyes ,I screamed and tried to push myself away but to no avail I was too weak..

  
 I felt useless, I had started to regret wishing for the mirror to smile back..

The figure dug and smushed anything in its way for him to obtain my eyes until a sickening pop was heard..  
 I could no longer see, just feel and all I could feel was utter pain.. I was dropped onto my back.

 I couldn’t move, I couldn’t see, I couldn’t breathe, I could only scream… I don’t remember what happened next but somehow someone found me by the smell of casqueted iron, they say I looked horrid and disfigured.. like a ghostly sunken being. 

Like the one I had seen..
