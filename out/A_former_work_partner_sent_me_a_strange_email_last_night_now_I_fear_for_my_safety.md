It happened last night around 11:30pm. I was getting ready to go to bed when I got a message notification on my laptop. It was an email titled, "If you've received this then you’ve been selected for a grand opportunity! Don’t resist!" and attached to it, was a Word Document. The email was from an ex-coworker whose real name I won't use (I'll be using the name Dave as a replacement). Not wanting to stay up for what I thought was an advertisement or promotion of some kind, I simply saved the attachment after seeing who the message was from. I then went to bed before being woken up around 3:30 at night to a loud thumping sound from the roof and my laptop beeping as it turned on seemingly by itself. Upon getting out of bed and opening the laptop, I saw that the screen was opened to the saved word document while a page to reddit had been opened.

After reading the Word Document in its entirety, I realized it wasn’t an advertisement; it was a warning. At first, I would’ve assumed it was a cruel prank of some kind. However, current circumstances have made me convinced that’s not the case. Once I'd realized that my computer likely had a virus, I tried to delete the word document and close reddit with no success. I then tried to turn off my computer, but it only gave an error sound in response. I also couldn't use my phone because it wouldn't turn on and the only things that my laptop would pull up were reddit, email, and Microsoft Word. I couldn't make since as to why David would do this but then I thought back to the Document. 

To make matters worse, my apartment was on the fifth floor so my only safe way out the door to my apartment. However, upon trying the door handle, the door was locked, and it wouldn’t unlock. Its peephole was also obstructed and that made me very fearful, causing me to scream for help. Unfortunately, no one responded to my pleas. Out of desperation, I decided to post the document here in an attempt to appease whatever is behind this.

To add context, I met Dave when we were both hired in the same group at our last job. Long story short, the job simply wasn't for us, and we were both let go the same day right before the end of our job's initial probationary period. After that, I went to work for a warehouse job to stay paying for the bills. I'll admit it's not the best job, but I won't complain because it pays enough for me to afford my monthly expenses. However, that didn't stop me from being jealous of Dave once I had learned that he had found work in a high-end experimental treatment facility.

I live in an area on the southeast coast of North America that's known for constant innovation. Dave on the other hand, lived 20 minutes away from me. That's partially why it wasn't so hard for both of us to find replacement jobs. However, it didn't explain his luck as I never took him as the kind of guy to work in the field of Biology and Gene Therapy. He seemed more of a mechanic than a scientist. Regardless, I was happy for him and moved on with my typical life.

That was all about 2 months ago.

The document I was sent was a letter. Some details such as names or the company's name were removed from the document, and I don't wish to find out why. Either way, this is the letter I received last night:

\-Message Starts-

If you're someone I sent this to, it means that I have been told that you will be our next employee. However, I shall give you some context first. Afterall, I'd like to catch up with you.

It all started after I didn't make my previous job's probationary period. I had moved to the local area just for that job. So, when I didn’t make the cut, I originally was planning on moving back to \[Removed\]. However, that soon changed as two nights before I was going to begin the move as I'd thought I'd have to, I got a letter form \[company name removed\]. It was a job offer.

"Hello David, we've heard about your recent and unfortunate separation from \[removed\]. We would like to extend a job offer after reviewing your skills and veteran status. We've determined that you'd be a better fit here with \[removed\] and your contributions valued. Your job would be relatively simple, and all necessary, state-of-the-art PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) will be provided to you when needed. You will be trained, costs covered by us, and if you determine the job is not for you before your training is complete, we will cover the cost and wish you farewell. However, should you choose to stay, we offer amazing benefits including full insurance coverage, competitive pay, and 152 hours of PTO! All we ask is that you're willing and able to work 12-hour shifts, lift more than 50lbs, comply with our reasonable NDAs. Should this offer pique your interest, don't hesitate to call us or email us!

Sincerely, \[CEOs name removed\]

\[contact information removed\]

\[company address removed\]"

I must've read it twice before deeming it as "too good to be true" However, the truth is, I was desperate. Desperate enough to take the time and reach out to the company. The fact is, I didn't want to go back to my home state of \[removed\]. If I had a shot at staying down here, why not try and see if it's genuine. “The worst thing that can happen is I get my time wasted” I thought.

I called the CEO the next day and to my surprise, long story short, it was successful! Not only that but the job's hourly wage was $10 more than my job. I only had to work 3 days a week with 4 extra hours being given to me for free to make my timesheet 40 hours a week!

I eagerly began my first two weeks on the job normal enough. It was mostly training videos relating to our job procedure, hands-on training, and meeting my coworkers. Immediately I noticed that all the coworkers barely ever talked. I chalked it all up as they simply being standoffish to me, the new hire. I figured they needed to warm up to me. After the first 2 weeks were done, I had a good idea of what I'd be doing. Then it occurred to me that I'd never been told what exactly the job was. Sure, I could guess based on the company name, but my day-to-day tasks had never been clearly outlined. That seemed very strange to me. However, the pay was undeniable. I simply forgot about the strangeness of it all. That was until I began my first day of work.

It started with me meeting the CEO, \[Name Removed\]. Immediately I noticed something was different about her. She was almost seven feet tall, and her skin was insanely pale. Her hair was jet-black as was the color of her eye’s irises. The shape of her upturned eyes made her gaze very intimidating as well.  She looked incredibly commanding and the way she dressed didn’t take away from that either. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying she was dressed inappropriately or unprofessionally but rather, she wore what looked like a soldier's uniform rather than a 3-piece suit. I was then made to sign several NDAs and various other contractual documents. The documents I was signing seemed standard but something in me felt wrong with it. I was then introduced to Arin, the person I'd be shadowing for my training. Everything went downhill from there. Immediately, within 5 minutes of meeting him, Arin began to give me a list of ominous, strange suggestions that sounded more like warnings.

1. If you hear the CEO talking to someone behind a locked door with the hallway lights flickering outside, walk away. She’s talking to the voice. Whatever they are talking about is none of your business and you want to keep it that way.
2. If you are working by yourself and the lights turn off. Don't move. You will hear a voice, cooperate with it, answer any questions it has and do what it says. I don't want to have to clean up after another, "unfortunate work accident."
3. Though this is unlikely, if the CEO tells you to meet them in their room. Do not keep them waiting. She doesn't like it when you're late because *it* is likely demanding your presence.
4. If you have questions about what exactly we do, don't ask. Don't try to tell anyone outside of this facility the nature of our work and its end goal should you find out. It's not us that will come for you, it's the voice.
5. If you happen to see the figure that the voice belongs to, it has respect for you. Keep it that way but avoid eye contact with it.
6. Do not refer to the voice as a "Demon", "Monster", "Threat" or "Mutant Human" and treat it with the utmost respect even when it's not around.
7. None of these suggestions I’ve given you are a "joke" of any kind. Take it seriously.

I didn't say anything, but I was more than confused. I could tell by his face that he was intent on convincing me. In fact, he had the most serious look I had ever seen on anyone’s face. He then said, "I have your back but don't get yourself in trouble. Don't mention what I've told you at lunch either. Everyone learns in their third week. Now, you know what they say about Rome? When in Rome, do as the romans do yeah? Well, you're in Rome so do as we do. Oh, and I'll say this one final time, nothing I've told you is to be talked about outside of the workplace. Don't think about it too hard though. Just don't forget either." My heart began to race slightly after hearing this as I struggled to go about the work routine of isolating and studying DNA strands, reorganizing documents, Injecting certain labelled syringes into various lab animals, etc.

The next 4 days went roughly the same as I got into the routine of things. I got better at my tasks and was even allowed to work alone by the end of the week. All the other coworkers at lunch would say things like, "I went to go work at my station but the door to the room was locked, I heard the voice talking to the CEO." or "The lights went out at my station yesterday, *IT* didn't say anything. The lights came on after 2 minutes. *IT* must've been observing." As these things were said, they exchanged knowing looks with no sign of any joking going on. At this point I was beginning to be convinced just by that alone. The following 4 weeks were almost completely normal. There was no mention of "The Voice" except towards the end of my 4th week when Arin said, "*IT* must be taking a break or a vacation if it does that sort of thing." before one of our coworkers apparently got a little too clever and said, "*IT* might just decide to screw off for once." Everyone then stopped to look at him with stern expressions and no one even smiled. No one else said anything about the voice for the rest of lunch that day. The whole event made me nervous even more.

Midway through my 5th week, I had my first encounter with the voice. It happened while I was about to mix two separate syringes as instructed by my station's computer screen. One was dark red and labelled, "Human Blood; O- Type" and the other was black simply labelled, "Black Blood." I was just about to mix them when the all the lights, including the light from my computer monitor cut out. I saw two red circles in the corner Then, I heard a low-pitched, inhuman voice speak, "So, you're their possible martyr? Interesting.” It spoke before continuing, “That black fluid is not blood. It's the mutagenic cells given off by a fungus from my world. It's what makes my kind the way we are. Tomorrow you will be made to do something dangerous but very important. In fact, that's why they brought you here. Because you are expendable due to your lack of prior experience and knowledge. However, I have an offer. If you complete their task and survive, I'll reward you with a non-refusable opportunity."

Its voice was beyond haunting because of how natural yet abnormal it sounded. It was like 2 people speaking at once. One voice was a faint feminine voice whispering while the other one was a very prominent masculine one. It’s almost as if it was from another world. "It's not from this world, is it?" I asked myself mentally. It responded, "Do I really have to answer that thought of yours to make it clear? Now, you were about to mix the two agents. Do you remember the catalyst? The clear fluid that will weaken the membranes of the human blood cells. The black blood will then be able to convert them into the black mutagenic substance. You better come into work tomorrow or I will have you killed. I'm more than capable of doing that myself" I didn't even ask how it knew to respond with that. I just stood there drenched in sweat and shaking, horrified at the whole experience. Then I thought back to the rules I was told on day 7. Any possible doubt I had about my co-worker's experiences and Arin’s suggestions was erased.

It then left without a trace and the lights came back on almost as soon as it did so. I completed the task according to instructions given. I watched as the red blood mixed with the clear, unlabeled catalyst fluid before mixing the solution with the black fluid a minute later as instructed. The entire petri dish became black within 1 minute. The liquid never dried up or evaporated. Rather, it just disappeared in a red flash 3 minutes later. One moment it was there and the next there was no trace of it.

The next day I was made to come to work at 6:30am which was 30 minutes earlier than normal. When I got to my assigned station as the basement level of the facility, I was greeted by the CEO again who told me I'd be working on a "willing test subject" for an experiment. She also told me that I and my immediate coworkers were the only employees on site except for a few executives that would also be present. I was still shaken up from the previous day’s experience and the weirdness of that current day. However, I was then fully convinced with the promise of 40k being deposited into my account immediately after successfully completing my task. I would've turned back had I known what would happen less than 30 minutes later.

I was put into a Level A Biohazard suit. I knew that this was serious when I was escorted by the CEO to an all-steel room with heavily reinforced observation glass and door that looked like it belonged in Fort Knox. In the middle of the room lie a young unconscious man who had a slender build and stood 5'10" in height according to the label on the medical bed he was strapped to. He had several IV hooked up to him and well as bodily monitoring equipment. I was then instructed through an intercom to press a white switch with the words above labelled "Catalyst feed activation." I did so a watched as one of the IVs began to fill up with clear fluid. A minute passed before I was told to toggle the white switch towards with words below labelled "Catalyst feed shut-off." Upon doing so, I was instructed to wait 1 minute. After waiting a minute, I was told to press a black switch with words above it labelled, "Infernal Biological Assimilating Mutagenic Agent." As that was done, a loud, high-pitched beep filled the room as the black fluid filled a separate IV tube running from a clear, gallon-sized capsule full of the black fluid. It was an alert warning of impending danger.

Everything went downhill as the room's lighting turned to a darkened red and the previously unconscious man before to thrash violently while letting out a series of screams that progressively became less human. The following cacophony of cracking bones and loud successive beeping alerts caused me to be nearly overwhelmed by fear. I then saw the once normal person transform into a hellish creature as their eyes began to leak the black blood-like substance injected into them from their eyes as the limbal ring of their irises began to glow a phosphorescent red. A sixth digit began to erupt between their two ring fingers and middle fingers. Two black, upward curved, horn-shaped appendages made of soft tissue began to grow from their forehead. Suddenly the person then let out one final demonic scream and simultaneously ripped the metallic hand and feet restraints from themselves with apparent ease. As I saw this happen, I realized what made the task so dangerous. Using quick thinking I chose to try using my employee badge on the entrance door’s scanner to the room. I knew it had likely been deactivated so I couldn't use it to escape the room and let the test subject out should things go south. However, one of them made a mistake.

I found this out when the door clicked open to the complete dismay of my co-workers. When the door had completely opened, the lights began to flicker. “No! Don’t do that!” were the last spoken words of Arin through the intercom as I stepped out of the open door. What happened next was a nightmare as the lights all went out plunging us all into complete darkness. Then heard heavy stomping from behind me as something knocked me down. It came from the test room behind me. It was the test subject. It’s inhuman breathing and pulse-like heartbeat was right behind me as I was laid out flat on the ground frozen in fear. I then heard heavy stomping to the left towards the observational room. This was then immediately followed by the sounds of gasping, screaming and then bones being forcefully snapped, gurgling, more screaming, and wet sounds of what sounded like numerous heavy organic masses hitting the floor. I’d imagined that those sounds came from other employees who had gotten in the creature’s way. The sudden burst of screaming was then heard as my coworkers were snatched up by the creature after it had ripped the locked door to the observational room off its hinges. I then got up and tried to call 911 on my phone but got no service. Instead, the light from my phone revealed a gory sight.

All around me was death and bodily destruction. The walls and floor were painted with blood and littered with human body parts. I then immediately froze for a second time before vomiting. However, it wasn’t the gory sight that made me puke. It was the two glowing red circles standing more than 6 ½ feet above the ground. These limbal rings illuminated enough to reveal a face. A human-like face. Before I could run to the stairwell a familiar voice called out to me. “No need to flee. Well done, Dave.” It was the voice. “You won’t need that anymore.” It said as a clawed six-digited hand reached out from my right and grabbed my phone before tossing against the adjacent wall, shattering the device and plunging me back into darkness. Then another voice called out, “You can stop drowning out the light now.” It was the CEO, but her voice was different. It was now two voices speaking, one being her normal feminine voice and the other being a faint masculine whispering voice.

As the lights came on, I nearly passed out from the surreal sight that beheld me. The CEO’s appearance had altered revealing a seemingly corrupted version of the woman who had met me earlier that day. Her eyes had become demonic with her limbal rings glowing red and drowning out the original color of her eyes. The same eyes that had black tears running from them in all directions across her face. The liquid seemed to defy gravity as it ran horizontal from her the tips of her eyes. This made her already intense stare even more ghastly. Her body now looked malnourished, and her hands had changed in the same manner as the test subject had. Her body would periodically spasm and twitch. As she spoke her teeth had also changed with her four canine teeth being noticeably enlarged. This caused the rest of her teeth to become crooked. As I noticed this, she then began to scream as her face emitted cracking sounds from within and blood poured out her nose. Then her upper and lower jaw widened and allowed the once crocked teeth to be shifted thus straightening her teeth. This seemed to cause her a lot of pain.

After seeing her I asked how she had changed to try and reason with her to which she responded, “I arranged all of this earlier today before I relieved all employees not present in the building today of their jobs. I Don’t want extra witnesses. Unlike the test subject, I willingly accepted this change as I injected myself with the serum at his command” she said while gesturing to the figure that had been known as “the voice”. This being had the same look as her and the test subject. Except they were in what look like modern US America’s soldier’s gear.

This wasn’t typical gear, however. As it was all black except for the highlights of red. The gear was also marked with symbols and words in a language that was unrecognizable. The voice then replied to the CEO, “That command she’s referring to was very command I gave her once I saw the experiment work successfully. I must say your CEO did more than I bargained for. She clearly understands where your kind has gone wrong and how to fix it. This brings me to the offer I was going to give you.” Before it could tell me however, it was then interrupted by the test subject storming out of the observational room.

“Y-you did this to me!” Were the final words of the subject as it yelled out with its demonic voice. It than reached its two arms out towards me and began to charge. The hellish soldier then pulled out a wand-like blade approximately 1 foot long and pointed it at the now charging creature. Once this happened, the head and chest of the test subject was obliterated in two gory spontaneous blasts as the blade flashed a bright red twice.

The voice then spoke, “(deep sigh) It’s a Shame they wouldn’t except our gift. Thus, they had to be eliminated. Hopefully you’ll be different.” I was puzzled by its remark, but it continued speaking, “I need more examples demonstrating this successful method of Human to \[removed\] transformation. If you choose to help me, I’ll let you live and keep your human form, should you still desire it, in exchange. If you agree, then you must choose the first of the next test subjects. Choose wisely.” After it said this, I knew that no matter what, my life would never be the same again.

Now I must confess to you. This message hasn’t been Dave writing to you. Instead, I, “The Voice” decided to give you a warm welcome. I was referred to your email by my reluctant accomplice. If you’re reading this, it means It’s too late for you to stop it. Try to flee if you wish but I think you’d do better to accept this abduction that’s soon to happen. That’s because I won’t be stopped. I’ll be arriving not long after this document is read. Then your mind will have been marked by the spell implanted in the words of the document. When I see you, David sends his regards.

\-Message ends-

After I first got done reading this, I just wanted this to be some kind of ridiculous joke but now I no longer feel that hope anymore as the lights have begun to flicker and I’m beginning to hear whispering sounds from my closet.

In a last-ditch effort to get help, I decided to attempt to start a fire in my kitchen to trip the smoke alarm. However, as I went over to the stove to turn it on, the power shut out and the lights turned off. Then, all the light from the outside streetlights seemed to dim unnaturally until no light came through at all. Now, the only thing illuminating my entire apartment was my laptop with its eerie blue glow lighting up the dark room around me. I decided to do the only thing I could think of. Just as I was about to post this, however. I heard what sounded like two demonic voices speaking at once coming from behind me.

I immediately lost all hope of as the horror of reality sunk in and froze my body still. The being spoke to me, “Your fate was sealed once you viewed the invisible spell embedded in the words of the document. Once your mind was infected, I simply manifested myself near the energy of your marked soul. That’s how I’ll get the next ones too. If you refuse to post this in some vain attempt to hinder me, I’ll simply kill you before posting it myself. Word of advice for you and the individuals I choose after you, open your mind and let it happen because your life as you've known it is over.

Go on now… ***post it.***”
