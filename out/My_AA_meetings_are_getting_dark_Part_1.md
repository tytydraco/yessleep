Hey guys, first time poster here. To make a long story short I got into an accident while drunk, and got sentenced to 50 hours of AA and community service along with a hefty fine with a suspended license dangling off the side of this shit sundae. The minor details don’t matter for the context of this story so I won't speak on it. So yeah, it's a Friday night. Prime time for bar hopping but here I am sitting in an artificially lit room with bad coffee, and slightly worse company. Not to say that they were bad people, but why would we be compatible? I know, alcohol isn't all there is to life, and I agree with you. But this place is such a downer that I can't help but feel a little ill will. It's better than the county so I can't really complain that much. It's my first night though, maybe one or two of the folks will grow on me. 

“I'd like to start off this meeting by addressing the new person in our group. Would you like to introduce yourself?”

He passes me this brightly colored stick with a feather tied to it with neon string.

“Uh the name is Mike, and I got court ordered to be here. I know I'm supposed to say I'm an alcoholic but honestly I just like drinking. I don't have a problem with it, I'm just here for my hours.”

I pass the stick back to the group leader

“Well, thank you for sharing Mike, I just want to remind you that if you want those hours signed off you have to participate.”

I nod submissively 

“Alright, who wants to go first?”

As the group trades experiences, and the talking stick amongst each other I see this woman walk in. She looks pretty from a distance, but when she gets closer you can tell that she's not keeping up with herself. Dirty clothes, a faint smell. She sits next to me since that was the only free chair there was. 

“Let's take a moment to welcome the new face in the room, Brian can you pass the talking stick to her?”

Brian passes the talking stick to the mystery woman but she slowly extends her arm like she's hesitant about the mere act of speaking a word. Though she does take it after a moment. 

“Hi everyone my name is Evelyn, and I have a drinking problem.” 

Everyone murmurs a hi Evelyn, I parrot the crowd after a short delay. 

“It all started about two weeks ago. Before that I wouldn't even consider having a drink if it wasn't the weekend. I don't know what changed in me but I started having these intense migraines that for some reason only alcohol could soothe. It spiraled from there, and here I am horribly sober, and unsure if this is the right choice. The doctor said I'm fine, and everything checks out but I don't know.”

The group leader chimes up after motioning for the talking stick.

“Thank you for sharing Evelyn, and no, you made the right decision. Life is hard but alcohol only makes life that much harder.

“What a load of crap.” I thought. The only thing that makes a bad day good is a cold beer.

“We go by the twelve step program here at AA Evelyn, are you familiar with it?”

She shakes her head

“Well the first step to being alcohol free is to admit that we are powerless in our addiction. And the second step is to acknowledge there is a power that can restore us to sanity.”

Evelyn motions for the talking stick which The group leader handed happily.

“give yourself over to a higher power?”

They pass the stick again. Talking stick? More like a passing stick. Jesus, this 50 hours of this is going to drive me insane. 

“Yes, it doesn't have to be a specific religion. Any belief will work.”

She closes her eyes in acknowledgement. He continues to say that they go by the buddy system. That means that everyone has one person in this group that they can rely on so that they're not going through the twelve steps alone. And wouldn't you guess it, everyone already has a buddy. So it would only be natural that I became Evelyn's buddy. Meeting ends, I get my first two hours signed off. I turn to the door, and when I get out I see Evelyn smoking a cigarette. She looks kinda happy. 

“You got another one of those?”

She hands me her pack, and I pull one out. I pull out a lighter and light it. I handed her pack back to her.

“thanks.”

I grunt as I exhale the smoke.

“You're welcome.”

We both stand there for a weird amount of time without talking. I break the silence.

“So, uh want my number? Since we're buddies now it'll just be easier.”

“Sure.”

She hands me her phone and I put in my number. 

“It was my first night too.”

I mumbled out. The cold air stinging my lips as I breathe out to speak. 

“It was? Why are you here? By choice or…?”

“I got court ordered to. Two hours down forty eight to go.”

“That sounds rough. Don't worry I'll make it easy for you.”

She smiles cutely. I blush slightly from her reply. 

“Don't worry about it, I can handle it.”

With that I put out the cigarette with my boot, and I said goodbye. 

Now let's fast forward to the next week since nothing of real importance happened. She didn't call, or text besides one text about half a week in. She just said that the twelve step program was helping her. I'm glad that this program actually does help people who want to quit get over their dependency with alcohol. I go into the next week with a renewed sense of vigor. I have someone counting on me to get them where they need to be. I walk in about five minutes early, the usual suspects are walking in, some are getting what I'm assuming to be a cup of motor oil. I look around the room for Evelyn. And there I saw her, in the same seat she was in before. I walk up to sit down next to her.

“How ya doin’?” 

She turns around, and I see a different woman. Not physically, but there is this light in her eyes that wasn't there before. 

“Yeah I'm great! My migraines even went away!”

She says beaming ear to ear.

“Hey that's great Evelyn! I'm happy to hear that.”

“I can't wait for the third step!”

She says it in a frantic tone, but I mistook it for excitement. I thought at the time that when someone hits rock bottom and they manage to get themselves together they get this renewed vigor for life and self improvement.  

The group sits down, and the group leader holds out the talking stick. Its neon colors are an utter eyesore. 

“who wants to start first?”

Evelyn perks her hand up first with alarming speed that only I seem to have noticed.

“I would love to start.”

The group leader smiles and hands her the talking stick

“I'm so happy to see you doing so much better Evelyn.”

Evelyn grabs the stick with both hands. Her knuckles are turning white.

“Hi Evelyn here, I've been sober for one week, and I have to be honest I've never felt better! I need to know what the third step is.”

She passes the stick to the group leader as quickly as her hands would allow. The group leader takes it without regard to those twitchy movements. Was he trying to be polite? 

“The third step is to give yourself over to that God, utterly and completely.”

She closes her eyes and smiles hard. I thought this was insane. Honestly though, I wish this was as far as it got. 

The rest of the group goes on as normal, I barely got my hours in with how distracted I was from that whole thing. When it finished I tried to just head to the bus stop. When Evelyn shows up from around the corner.

“Hey buddy! Where ya goin’?”

I put on a facsimile of a smile even though I felt a growing unease with her presence. 

“Oh I'm heading to the bus stop to go home.”

“I can drive you!”

She says with that same grin, that light I once saw turned into a glint of madness with the way she was bending and moving like she was doing ballet moves while getting ready to play a round of football.

“N-No I'm fine. Thanks though."

I'm ashamed to admit it as a six foot man that weighs 215 pounds but this petite woman is scaring me. 

“Aw, why not? I just wanna show my buddy how much I care about them.”

“No, I'm fine, I like the walk home. It's really nice out tonight.” 

The smile twitches for a moment as she holds her eye contact.

“Well if you insist!”

She snaps back to being animated again. 

“Get home safe buddy.”

This is where we're caught up with the story. The next meeting is in a couple of days, and Evelyne just messaged me that she's embraced the third step. I'm not sure if being free is worth it.
