When I was 6 my dad murdered my mom, and I grew up in the system. That’s the kind of thing people don’t know how to respond to, so I usually keep it to myself. But it shaped everything. 

From then on, I was bounced between homes like a package nobody really wanted. You learn not to unpack too much, not to grow roots, because sooner or later someone decides you don’t belong. I got good at reading people, good at knowing when it was time to disappear into myself. 

Then I ended up with two other kids in a beat-down house on the south side of Chicago, under the roof of a woman who was just doing her best to get by. The paint was peeling, the floors were soft, and the nights were filled with sirens and shouting from the street, but for the first time, I wasn’t completely alone.

There was Kenny, who was older than me by a year but carried himself like he’d lived twenty. He had a sharp tongue and the kind of confidence that made you forget we were all just kids. He’d tell stories about things he’d seen on the streets—fights, robberies, close calls with cops and gangs—and the way he talked, you could almost believe he was untouchable. He was the one who always wanted to push further, to test how much the world could take before it hit back. He’s the kind of guy that would always be right behind you, no matter what.

Clay was different. He barely spoke when I first met him, answering questions with shrugs or single words. But once he decided you were safe, he let little pieces of himself show—his crooked smile, his way of humming nursery rhymes under his breath when he thought nobody was listening, the way he’d share food even when he barely had any to spare. He’d give you the clothes on his back if that’s all he had. 

If Kenny was fire, Clay was stone: steady, quiet, and heavier than he looked.

The three of us carved out a rhythm in that house. We’d sit on the front steps when the weather wasn’t too bad, watching people stumble past with paper bags and cigarettes. Sometimes we’d trade stories about where we’d been before, though never the whole truth. Some things were too heavy to set down in front of other people. At night, when the city outside felt like it was cracking apart, we’d huddle in the same room. Sometimes we’d sit on the roof during hot summer nights and talk until we started nodding off. 

One night in early spring, the three of us decided to sneak out after the woman who looked after us had gone to bed. Kenny had swiped a half-empty pack of cigarettes from some guy who left them on the bus seat, and he was dying to try them out. 

We climbed onto the roof through the rattling window frame and sat with our legs dangling over the edge, the city stretched out around us in broken streetlights and the glow of far-off skyscrapers.

Kenny lit the first cigarette, took one drag, then immediately coughed so hard I thought he was going to die right there. Clay and I laughed until our sides hurt, and Kenny tried to play it off like he’d meant to do it. He handed it to Clay, who just shook his head and muttered, “I’m good. The smell reminds me of some bad stuff.”

When it got to me, I surprised them both by taking a drag. It burned all the way down, but I forced myself to hold it in, eyes watering, until my lungs gave up and exploded into a fit of coughing. Kenny hooted and said I was tougher than both of them, and for a second it felt like we were normal kids with no past to run from, no labels stuck to our names. Just three boys on a roof, laughing at nothing, watching the smoke disappear into the dark sky.

Somewhere in the distance, a siren wailed and cut off too suddenly, like it had been swallowed by the night. The sound left a hollow quiet behind it, and I remember thinking how easy it was for things to vanish in this city without a trace. People, noise, light—it all got eaten up eventually.

That was the thing about us—we didn’t need much. A stolen cigarette, a rooftop view, and the sound of each other’s voices was enough to make us forget the rest of the world. For a while, at least.

They weren’t family, not really, but in a way they were closer than anything I’d had since my dad struck me for the last time. We all knew what it meant to be unwanted, so we stuck together, no matter how deep the trouble we were in. And it was one of Kenny’s ideas that got us into trouble that night. One of his stories that led us to the stairway. 

Kenny had just turned seventeen, which felt like a world away from sixteen. He carried himself like he was a grown man, and Clay and I trailed behind him like little brothers most of the time. That night, he stormed through the door with that grin of his, the one that meant he’d found trouble worth sharing. He tossed a thick baggie onto the table before sitting on the sofa with a deep exhale.

He started talking but every word flew out of his mouth like they were too heavy to keep in. “Guy I bought this from wouldn’t shut up about some place downtown with a haunted stairwell. Says it’s for real haunted and he went there himself—nobody’s made it all the way to the bottom.” 

Clay gave Kenny a side-eye and let out a short laugh. “So you just believed him? Sounds like bullshit to me.” 

I grabbed Kenny’s bong from his dresser and cracked the window. “I’m with Clay on this one. You sound like an idiot right now.”

Kenny just waved our skepticism away—eyes bright with that stubborn belief he always carried when it came to ghost stories. “Say what you want, I’m checking it out tomorrow.” He flashed a grin so wide it felt like he’d already won.

“So you’re going downtown to do what exactly? Walk down some stairs and be let down when nothing happens?”

“No, that’s what you’d do. I’m gonna walk down those stairs and prove it’s real. If you’re too chicken shit to come with me, that’s your problem.”

“I’m not chicken shit, I just don’t know what you’re hoping to get out of this.”

I finished packing a bowl in the bong and took a rip as their argument faded into background noise. I let the smoke sit in my chest until it burned, then blew it out slowly. “Alright, enough,” I said, waving the air between them like I could clear the tension with the smoke. “If Kenny wants to chase ghosts, let him. Doesn’t mean we have to sit here arguing about it all night.”

“Level with me, Isaac. I can see it—you wanna know just as bad as I do.”

He wasn’t exactly wrong. I didn’t believe in ghost stories, but they always pulled at me anyway. And even if nothing happened, it beat sitting in that mildew-stinking apartment all night. I took another hit while I tossed the idea around. “I’m not saying I believe in it, but yeah—I’ll go with you.”

“You’re seriously buying into this?” 

I shrugged. He leaned further back in his chair with an exasperated gasp. 

“Fine. I’ll go with you two.”

Kenny lit up as the words came out of his mouth. “You don’t know it yet, but you won’t regret it.” 

We passed the bong around until the room got hazy and the argument finally fizzled out. Nobody said much after that. Kenny stretched out on the sofa with that smug little smile that meant he’d won. Clay sat quiet, arms folded, staring at the floor like he was already regretting what he’d agreed to.

When I finally crawled into bed, the apartment smelled like skunk, smoke, and mildew, the way it always did, but something about it sat heavier than usual. I told myself it was just another one of Kenny’s stories, just another night. But I kept picturing a staircase sinking down into the dark, step after step after step, like it was waiting for us.

It was cold that Saturday morning, so cold that my breath was as clear as day leaving my mouth. The weatherman swore it’d be clear skies for the rest of the week, but the city woke up buried in white. I told myself it was just weather, but deep down I felt like the world was warning us to stay home.

Kenny was up microwaving Hot Pockets and already dressed. “Hey, did you see all the snow outside? Wasn’t supposed to snow ‘til next week. I’ll tell you what I think though—it’s a good sign for tonight.” He grinned like he had brought the storm himself.

“I wouldn’t call it a good sign. If anything it’s just harder for us.” I looked around our tiny apartment and failed to see Clay anywhere. “Is Clay not up yet?”

“He’s taking a shower I think—just in case the power goes out or something.” The old busted heater clicked on as he finished his sentence. 

The smell settled thick in the room, and for a second it felt like the whole place was rotting from the inside out. Maybe that’s why Kenny’s bullshit about cursed stairwells didn’t sound so bad—I was ready to breathe air that didn’t taste like mold and cigarette ash. 

Clay shuffled out of the bathroom a minute later, hair still damp, rubbing his arm with the towel. He sniffed the air and wrinkled his nose. “Great. They didn’t fix the heater.”

Kenny smiled as crumbs fell from his face. “Why does it matter? We won’t be here tonight!”

Clay frowned at the mention of tonight’s plan. “I still think it’s stupid and kind of pointless.”

The way he said it stuck with me. We wouldn’t be here. We’d be out there, looking for some cursed stairs like it would actually prove anything. I told myself it was nothing—just another story—but the thought hung over me for the rest of the day.

By the time night settled in, the snow hadn’t let up. The city streets were buried in slush and near silence, the kind of quiet that only came after a storm. We bundled up and slipped out the door, Kenny leading the way like he was marching us into destiny. Clay trudged behind, hands shoved deep in his hoodie pocket, and I kept pace between them, pretending I wasn’t just as nervous.

The walk to the stairwell was quiet and unnerving. Nothing happened, but that in itself is unusual for Chicago. No yelling, gunshots, cars, horns, sirens, or anything. Just the crunch and squish of slush and snow. None of us said anything other than an occasional observation or joke to fill the silence.

Kenny stopped at a random alley before signaling us to follow him. “This is the place.” 

I expected something obvious—a haunted house, some crumbling ruin—but it was just an alley. That almost made it worse, like whatever this was didn’t need to put on a show.

He laid on his stomach and climbed through the chain-link fence guarding the alley. Someone had already cut a decent sized hole through it.

“Great, nothing screams ‘good idea’ like crawling through a hole in a fence. There’s no shame in us turning back now.”

“Relax Clay, this isn’t a guarded building or anything. You’ll be fine.”

I crouched down after Kenny, the metal of the fence cold against my palms. It felt less like sneaking in and more like slipping into someplace we weren’t supposed to be. 

The snow was cold against my legs and chest despite the multiple layers I was wearing. The fence rattled as I squeezed my way through—careful not to cut myself.

Clay let out a low groan after I made my way through. He got on the floor and started scooting against the concrete. His thick jacket made loud noises as it scraped against the concrete. About halfway though one of the sharp ends of the fence caught the jacket. It ripped as he tried to unhook it.

“Shit, my jacket’s caught on the fence.” Clay tugged at it, but the metal just bit deeper. After a long breath, he slipped out of it and left it hanging there. “That was my only jacket. Fuck.”

Kenny peeled his off without thinking and tossed it over. “Here. Take mine. I don’t need it.”

That was Kenny—always charging forward like nothing could touch him, while Clay left pieces of himself behind. I pulled myself to my feet and looked around. On this side of the fence, the alley seemed quieter, heavier, like we’d stepped someplace the city had forgotten.

The building was old, possibly condemned, and it had definitely seen better days. It looked it it was left sitting for decades.

Kenny walked a little ahead before getting back on his knees and calling us over again. He pointed to a small door, only big enough to crawl through. The door was made of some kind of metal—rusted with warped hinges and a sagging frame. When I looked closely I saw a faint yellow triangle with a screwdriver or wrench painted onto the door.

The size threw me off. It obviously wasn’t meant for everyday use, but it was here for a reason. Why make someone crawl through a tunnel for any reason?

Kenny’s stature visibly changed when he brushed the snow from the door. “I told you. Get ready to eat your words.”

Clay shook his head. “This is obviously some kind of maintenance thing. There’s no telling what kind of equipment could be down there. I’m not worried about a ghost, I’m worried about the danger right in front of you.”

I wanted to laugh his concern off like Kenny, but he wasn’t wrong. Still, we’d already walked a few miles, and it’d feel stupid to quit now. 

“Clay’s got a point. But if we’ve come this far, we might as well take a look so tonight’s not a waste. We’ll turn back if it gets bad.”

Kenny grinned as he felt for the handle “I knew you’d have my back.” 

Kenny tugged the handle and the little door shrieked as it opened. A wave of cold, stale air rolled out, carrying the smell of mildew and rust. Kenny handed us both of us a flashlight before going in first.

The crawlspace was barely wide enough for us to squeeze through. I dropped to my hands and knees, the ceiling pressing down so close it brushed my back. Every movement made the metal groan, and the sound of our breathing bounced back at us in short, shallow bursts.

The tunnel stretched farther than it had any right to, a suffocating box of concrete and shadow. By the time I saw the faint outline of open space ahead, my shoulders already ached from being pinned so tight.

A hollow thud rattled the tunnel, followed by Kenny’s groan. For a second I thought he’d vanished into nothing. After a moment of silence he spoke up. “There’s a drop off at the end guys. All the wind got knocked out of me—hurt like hell.” 

I shouted an acknowledgement while mostly being focused on controlling my breathing. I made it to the end of the tunnel and stuck my hands out to hold myself up as I freed my feet.

Clay made his way out slowly behind me and eventually stood up and dusted himself off. “We made it through the tunnel. Great. Now can we go back? I’d rather freeze out there than break my neck in here.”

The stairwell was worse than I imagined. Just past the crawlspace, it opened into a yawning pit of darkness. Concrete walls pressed in from all sides, slick with moisture that smelled like rust and rot. Kenny went first, stepping down with that stupid grin plastered across his face. “See? Told you nothing scary,” he said, though his voice sounded small in the echoing shaft.

Clay hesitated at the edge, hands braced against the railing. “This isn’t a joke. We don’t know what’s down there.”

I slid past him, letting my flashlight lead the way. The beam cut swaths through the black, but it felt like the shadows themselves bent and twisted away from the light. The walls were carved with shapes I couldn’t comprehend—faces that seemed to scream silently, hands that stretched up and disappeared into the stone. The deeper we went, the colder the air became. My breath left the floor in ghostly puffs.

It started with whispers. First one, then another, until they filled the stairwell like smoke. Kenny laughed. “It’s just the wind,” he said, though his voice had a twitch I hadn’t noticed before. I knew better. The whispers were too deliberate, forming words we couldn’t quite catch but felt aimed at us, crawling under skin and bone.

Step after step, it got worse. Shapes moved in the corners of my eyes. Shadows pooled and shifted. Clay held the flashlight tighter, jaw clenched, muttering something under his breath. I tried to focus on the concrete steps beneath my feet, anything to keep the panic from climbing my throat.

Then we heard it: a scream. Human, ragged, echoing, but wrong. It wasn’t coming from any particular direction—it was all around us, bouncing between the walls, amplified and warped. Kenny froze, his grin gone, replaced by wide, frantic eyes.

“Do you hear that?” I asked in disbelief.

He nodded, voice tight. “It’s—just a joke… right?”

The steps below us began to crumble underfoot. The concrete in front of us cracked and fell into darkness, revealing something I don’t even know how to describe. Thousands of faces with infinite expressions all staring at us at once.

The carvings on the walls moved, eyes forming and closing as if watching. The whispering turned into laughter, human but impossibly high and broken, layered over itself until it became a cacophony.

Kenny, the idiot that he was, didn’t move at all. “What the fuck…”

The last words died in a choked scream as the railing beneath him gave way. He toppled forward, reaching for us, and I lunged, grabbing his arm. Clay joined, but the weight was too much, the pull too strong. 

He screamed and thrashed. “Please don’t let go! Please, I don’t want to die! Please don’t let me die!”

His hand slipped. There was a snap, a sound I can’t forget, and then he was gone, falling into that impossible darkness, screaming, and then… nothing. Just the echo of his scream: stretched, twisted, and distorted until it was something I could feel in my bones.

Clay and I stumbled back, slipping on the slick steps, gasping, hearts hammering. The whispers and growls followed, rising to a deafening pitch as if the thing below knew it had won. We ran, tripping over broken concrete, scraping ourselves on the walls, until finally we burst into the cold air above, snow and silence replacing the suffocating black.

We didn’t speak for a long time. Clay’s eyes were wide, unblinking. I could feel the shock and disbelief rolling off him like waves. We made it to the street, breath steaming, lungs burning, hearts trying to escape our chests. Kenny was gone, and nothing we could say or do would bring him back.

The city outside had not changed. The snow still fell, white and quiet, indifferent. I could see my own reflection in the frozen puddles and barely recognized the pale, shaking kid staring back. For the first time, I realized that some doors, once opened, do not close.

Now, I’m twenty-five. Old enough to know better, old enough to feel the weight of what we lost, and old enough to understand that I can’t ignore it anymore. But I can’t stop thinking about that stairwell, about the thing that took him, and about what’s still down there, waiting.

I’m going back. Not because I want to, not because I think I can stop it. I’m going back because I have to. And I’m writing it down, because if I don’t, the story—the truth—will vanish like so many other things in this city. 

If I don’t write again, consider me dead.
