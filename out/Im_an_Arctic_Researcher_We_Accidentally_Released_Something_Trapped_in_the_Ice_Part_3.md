**June 19, 2021**

The entity's laughter faded as it began to pace around the room, slowly, deliberately, like a wild animal sizing up its territory. It moved with a disjointed grace, limbs twisting and contorting independently. Yet its gaze, filled with a primal and animalistic intelligence, never strayed from us. An eerie sense of foreboding settled over me as I stared into the depths of its eyes.

Becca looked stunned. "It has their voices," she murmured, her voice echoing horror. "How can it have their voices?"

I was too shocked to respond, grappling with the surreal reality of a creature physically before me. It felt like discovering the monster under my bed was real after all. Before eyes was an Ijiraq.

The huskies suddenly lunged forward, their growls escalating into feral snarls in a brave attempt to protect us. Their bravery snapped me out of my shock. The creature jerked its head towards the dogs, its form morphing into a giant wolf, mouth gaping, sharp fangs glistening.

“No!” I yelled out.

Instinctively, I reached into my pocket and pulled out the knife I'd picked up at Katak's home. The blade was cool to the touch, the intricate symbols carved into the handle pressing into my palm.

The room was still for a moment as the entity stared at me. Behind me, I could hear Becca's soft footsteps, her breaths drawn in quiet, controlled patterns. She was inching toward her pack, painstakingly slow to avoid drawing attention. The floorboards creaked under her weight.

My heart pounded in my chest, every thump echoing through my body, a constant reminder of the danger we were in. Regardless, I remained rooted to the spot, my eyes locked on the Ijiraq. Its form continued to shift, solidifying into something more threatening. It resembled a fearsome beast now, more bear than human, the antlers of a caribou replacing the straight black hair. It seemed to be preparing itself for a confrontation.

Becca reached her pack, her movements almost soundless. She rummaged inside for a brief moment before her fingers closed around the stock of her Sako 85, a rugged bolt-action rifle she had packed as protection against polar bears.

The Ijiraq was becoming increasingly agitated. Its form started convulsing, as if it was trying to contain an inner tempest. Its movements became more violent, the antlers slamming against the wooden beams, a gruesome display of power and aggression.

Becca was now on her feet, rifle in hand. She moved swiftly and deftly, her eyes burning with cold determination, as though the dying cries of her colleagues had ignited a fury within her.

As the creature turned towards her, she fired at it point-blank, the sound of the shot ringing through the cabin. The bullet tore through the its nebulous form, ripping a solid chunk of flesh from the transient layer of smoke and ice. A gut-wrenching howl filled the room.

The Ijiraq recoiled, its form flickering wildly between various shapes - human, animal, monster - each more horrifying than the last. Its body was writhing and shifting more wildly than ever.

As it staggered back, a viscous, dark fluid began to ooze from its wound. The smell was overpowering, far worse than the gas. It was a nauseating mixture of sulfur and rot, a stench so potent that it made my eyes water and my stomach churn.

As the creature writhed in pain, its haunting howls transformed into the anguished cries. In its agony, it went into a frenzy, thrashing around the room, its form undulating and changing rapidly.

Becca worked quickly to chamber another round, but the creature's frenzied movements made it difficult to get a clear shot. As she lined up her aim, the creature lunged towards her, its claws outstretched and its eyes fixed on her.

"Becca, watch out!" I shouted. Acting on instinct, I pushed her out of the way. We both tumbled to the ground as the creature’s claws sliced into my parka, narrowly missing my skin. Its momentum carried it into the wall of the cabin. The impact shook the entire cabin, dislodging several wooden planks from the wall. The Ijiraq howled in frustration and pain, shards of wood protruding from its body.

“Go!” I urged Becca. “Get the dogs and get out now!”

She nodded, scrambling towards the dogs who were barking and whining in distress. Becca hurriedly gathered them, leading them toward the door.

I turned back to face the entity. Its form was slowly solidifying, and its blackened eyes were fixed on me. Fueled by a surge of adrenaline, I grabbed a portable kerosene heater nearby. It was a hefty device, radiating a comforting warmth that felt out of place in this nightmarish situation. I hoisted it, feeling the fuel sloshing inside.

“Noah! We gotta go now!” Becca shouted from the door.

I waited for a split second, watching as the Ijiraq began to approach. As it charged at me, I hurled the heater with all the force I could muster. The kerosene heater spiraled through the air, colliding with the creature.

The cabin was instantly bathed in the terrifying light of a fireball. The entity let out a horrifying shriek that echoed through the cabin. I bolted towards the sled without a second glance.

As Becca and I made our escape, the fire quickly spread to the nearby wooden structures, turning the village into an inferno.—Our sled slid smoothly over the icy terrain, pushed by the hardy dogs, carrying us farther and farther from the village. The roaring wind cut through us, and the snow, stirred into a whirlwind by the storm, reduced visibility to near zero. As we moved further away, the light from the raging fire grew fainter, swallowed by the unrelenting white.

We continued on, in the general direction of Outpost Aurora. Our primary concern was putting distance between us and the creature rather than reaching our destination. With the light fading behind us and the storm intensifying, we knew we needed to find shelter soon. We were in the heart of the tundra, a vast, flat, treeless plain. Seeking refuge in this desolate expanse was no simple task, but we were fortunate enough to stumble upon a formation of ice and snow that provided a modicum of shelter from the piercing winds.

We set to work building an impromptu snow shelter, scooping and packing the snow to form a protective barrier against the wind. Once we'd made a space that was small but secure, we settled in.

Our breath fogged up in the confined space, but it was better than being exposed to the elements."We need a fire," Becca said, her teeth chattering as she spoke.

I nodded, fumbling with the waterproof matches we had in our pack. The wood we'd managed to gather was scant and frozen, but soon, a feeble fire was flickering between us, providing some warmth and more importantly, a psychological comfort.

From our shelter, we could see the faint orange glow of the burning village in the distance. It was a haunting sight, the ghostly illumination a grim reminder of what we'd left behind.

We hardly said a word to each other, the weight of our recent encounter hanging in the air. I felt a need to say something, but wasn't ready to discuss the terrifying implications of what we'd faced. Instead, I asked, "Where'd you learn to shoot like that?"

Becca stared into the fire, her gaze distant. "My dad used to take me and my brothers hunting when we were kids. We grew up in Newfoundland. Every season, without fail, we'd load the pickup and head up to the Northern Peninsula."

"What’d you hunt?" I asked.

"Mostly small game, like snowshoe hares and grouse, but also the occasional moose," she said, absentmindedly.

“Wow, sounds like a lot of fun,” I said.

"It was. It was the highlight of my childhood…” Becca said, her voice devoid of joy. “Until my youngest brother Chris got lost."

Her somber blue eyes were lit up by the fire. "I was the oldest. I was supposed to be watching him," Becca confessed, her voice barely above a whisper. "And I was. But I got distracted for just a moment. That's all it took."

“Becca…” I began.

"We found him a day later, but... it was too late. He had died of exposure," Becca's voice faltered slightly. The weight of her guilt filled the small space between us.

“I’m so sorry…” I started saying.

She could see how uncomfortable the conversation was making both of us feel. "Hey, so anyway, that was a hell of a throw back there," Becca complimented me, changing the subject, her demeanor changing as well.

I smiled faintly and shrugged, "I used to play baseball in high school."

"Oh, Really?" She asked, her brows lifting above her frosty eyelashes. “You must have been the MVP.”

"I mostly just kept the bench warm," I confessed, feeling a pang of the old, familiar embarrassment.

"Well, it was their loss," Becca replied, her voice steady, sincere. The compliment warmed me more than the fire.

I just gave her a nod. We were both too tired to talk, and it seemed like a positive note to end on. There was a silence between us, filled only by the soft crackling of the fire and the low growl of the storm outside. We were both lost in our own thoughts, our own memories. Tonight had unearthed ghosts we'd rather leave buried. But we weren't alone in the storm, in the middle of nowhere. We had each other, and for now, that was enough.

**June 20, 2021**

The storm raged outside, the howling winds and snow pelting against our makeshift shelter, while my mind churned with questions, doubts, and fear. In the early hours of the morning an unexpected sight met our eyes.

As we huddled around the small fire, our bodies seeking warmth and comfort from each other's presence, a faint cawing sound echoed through the storm. Above us, the gray-white sky darkened, and a large flock of ravens appeared, circling our tiny shelter against the wrath of the storm. A harsh caw echoed through the air, cutting through the storm like a knife. Their flapping wings were barely audible over the storm, yet the birds maintained a steady formation, completely unaffected by the gale.

Two of the ravens broke away from the group and landed a few feet away from us. As they turned to face us, I realized, to my horror, that they were eyeless. An empty, dark void existed where their eyes should have been, mirroring the soulless eyes of the Ijiraq we encountered back at the village.

One of the ravens started to speak in a voice that was hauntingly familiar, a little girl's voice. "Mama, where are you? It's so dark...I'm scared," it cawed, echoing innocence and fear. The other raven spoke next, the voice of a woman filled with a mother's worry. "I can't find my child, my Aputi,” it cried out.

Aputi... the name reverberated in my mind. The mother was Nanouk, and the little girl was Aputi. I remembered them from my visit to the village, days before. Aputi was a curious child, and Nanouk had the warmest of smiles. The thought of their fate made my stomach churn.

Looking up, we saw the other ravens had begun to circle lower. Each one uttered a single statement, each in a different voice, each a haunting echo of the villagers. The air was filled with their desperate cries, pleas for help, and calls for loved ones.

Becca drew back in horror. “The voices… Those are the villagers, aren’t they?” she gasped, putting a gloved hand to her mouth.

I didn’t respond. I just shook my head in disbelief. I couldn’t think straight with the macabre cacophony of disembodied voices ringing in my ears.

Becca turned to me and squeezed my arm tight. “What’s happening? Are these ravens also Ijiraq?

What did they do to the villagers?” She asked, her eyes boring into mine.

“The Ijiraq are just made-up stories!” I reiterated. “They’re not real!”

“I don’t believe in superstitions either, but I’ve seen… I’m seeing the impossible with my own eyes,” she said, gesturing to the flock of ravens circling us.

I swallowed hard, glancing at the ravens as they swooped lower. I didn't want to entertain the possibility, but in the face of the inexplicable, what else could I do?

"All right," I began, my voice shaky, "Let's pretend the Ijiraq is real."

I took a deep breath and composed my thoughts. “In Inuit myths, people are turned into Ijiraq, which are like twisted caricatures of themselves, often as punishment for disrespecting the spirits of nature. This could be anything from failing to perform the proper ritual for a prey they killed, to not properly honoring the dead. Or in our case… "

Becca stared at me, fear dawning in her eyes. "Drilling a mile into the side of a cursed mountain…”

I hesitated, but nodded. “Yeah, I believe so. I think we might have unwittingly released some kind of... entity, or force. That gas... maybe it's not just gas. Maybe it's something spiritual, something ancient. And exposure to it... is turning everyone into Ijiraq.”

“So, those ravens are the villagers?” asked Becca.

“I think so…” I responded.

“And that creature back at the village?” she asked.

“I think the drill crew were all amalgamated to form that thing,” I explained. “That’s why it couldn’t maintain its shape and had all their voices.”

“Oh, my God,” Becca exclaimed, her face becoming ashen with the realization.

“Wait… are we going to turn too?” she asked, her voice filled with dread.

"I don't know," I replied, unable to mask the fear in my own voice. I didn’t want to imagine that fate for us. I wouldn't let that happen to us. But deep down, I knew the reality. We had been exposed to the gas too. If my hypothesis was correct, we were already infected.

Suddenly, another raven descended from the circling flock and landed on our shelter, its eyeless gaze locked on us. It cawed in a voice we hadn’t yet heard, one that struck terror in our hearts.

"Your time will come," it croaked in a gravelly voice before taking off, disappearing into the storm. The words hung in the cold air, an ominous prophecy that made our surroundings feel even colder.
