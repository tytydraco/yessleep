I'm writing this here in hopes of finding someone with a very specific set of knowledge, as I have no clue what I'm doing .

This morning, I woke up and began my usual rituals: put some coffee on, watched TikTok's as I ate my breakfast, and took my morning "constitutional" if you catch my drift. I'm not one of the few fortunate to own a house, and instead I live in a cheap apartment in the semi-not-nice side of town. This comes with the lovely horrors of pests on a daily basis. Mice that my cats catch on a regular basis, flies and gnats during the hot months, and worst of all: cockroaches.

The cockroaches are the absolute worst. If I leave out a single piece of food for just long enough to go piss, I will come back to it absolutely covered in roaches. I can't even watch tv without them crawling all over the walls and ceiling.

So that's where this morning comes in. I have had my final straw and decide to finally put and end to this plague. I drive down to the closest hardware store and sift through the shit I've already used: sprays, powders, fumes, liquids, gels, all of it. That's when I saw a discreet bottle labeled "Cadavaceous Earth." I thought I had heard of it, but had never used it so I just threw it in my basket with a few extra roach traps for good measure. 

When I got back home, I dumped the fine powder all over my counters and inside the cabinets, according to the instructions on the side. It did have a *strong* smell, per se, but it did give me that slight tinge of ozone. I figured my liberal pouring of the stuff had just increased what minor smell there might be. All that was left was to wait.

Sure enough, about two minutes passed as I made me some lunch (as I had spent the morning shopping and powdering), and one roach came crawling from the cracks behind my counter. It took its time, but eventually made its way to the Cadavaceous Earth that now lined the counter. As soon as it stepped in the powder, it covered the roach like a soft snow blanket making it pitch white. The roach twitched its antennae as if it was also smelling the ozone curiously before it flipped over onto its back. It wriggled and writhed for a few moments before laying completely still.

I exhaled after what felt like an eternity of holding my breath. Finally something had fixed it. Finally something had worked and I can live in peace, free of the horseman of pestilence. 

As soon as these thoughts entered my brain, however, the critter on my counter began to kick again, flipping itself over. I was absolutely livid and took off my shoe to kill it the old fashioned way. I slammed it down and when I picked my shoe back up, it was still there. Unscathed. I swatted it a few more times and there were no guts, no squishing, nothing! It just shambled back behind the counter and out of sight. 

I leaned up against the wall, finishing my lunch before the roaches got to it. I started racking my brain of other solutions, Maybe I could just take the financial hit and get my place fumigated. But then my neighbors would have to leave, too, and they wouldn't do that. Might just move at this point, but I can't afford to break my lease.

A tickle invaded on my arm I was using to eat. 

I looked down, and the powder-covered roach had returned. I instinctively swatted it off and went to crush it. When I looked down at the floor, there was a small swarm of white roaches scurrying around my feet! I started stomping and squishing, but they never died! They just kept scurrying around my feet, and one even started to crawl up my ankle. I brushed it off and ran out of the kitchen only to find my counters and sink filled with the little fuckers. 

When I entered the living room, the walls had little white critters creeping out from cracks I didn't even know existed. My couch was a hot spot for the roaches' white party, and my TV was so covered it looked like static on an unbroadcasted channel. I had no choice but to grab my keys and book it out of there. 

These are not roaches anymore, and they obviously can't be killed by regular means. I'm terrified of returning to my home and I'm currently sitting in a Starbucks, typing this on my phone, terrified of going back home once this place closes. I tried Googling everything I could, but nothing came up. I can't even find the weird white powder I used anywhere. I've officially run out of options and need some online strangers' help. What do I even do here?
