This is a true story—an experience that recently resurfaced in my memory. Between the ages of six and fourteen, I was an avid sleepwalker, often experiencing intense night terrors. When I sleepwalk, my memories of the experience are hazy, like I’m trapped in a dream, unable to control my body.

The first time it happened was on Christmas Eve when I was six. I remember it so clearly because of the dream I had that night. In it, Santa had arrived early with a special present just for me. I was so excited to meet him, but I needed my best friend with me. In the middle of the night, I got out of bed, walked straight to the front door, and stepped outside barefoot in my pajamas. I crossed the street and went to my friend’s house, ringing the doorbell over and over until her mother answered. She shook me awake and took me home.

My grandma was in complete shock. The next day, she installed complex locks and an alarm system that would wake me up if I tried to open the door. But the pattern continued for about a year, I always went back to that same door, at least once or twice a week. By the time I was eight, they had seemingly stopped. No more sleepwalking, no more night terrors. Then, six years later, it happened again. We were on a family beach vacation, staying in the same condo we visited every year. I usually slept with my grandma, but since there hadn’t been an incident in so long—and I was older—she let me sleep on the pullout couch in the living room.

That night, I had a vague, unsettling dream. I could hear the waves crashing against our second-story window, and strangers had broken in, trying to hurt my family. I don’t remember much of the dream itself, so I’ll just tell you what was caught on camera. I got up, walked to the kitchen, and sifted through all of our room keys until I found the one for unit 714—my aunt’s condo, several floors above us. I took the elevator but stood inside for nearly ten minutes before finally pressing the button for the seventh floor. Once there, I unlocked my aunt’s door, walked inside, and headed straight to the beachside balcony. I never checked on her.

This is the part that truly haunts me. The only part of the dream I vividly remember is chasing an intruder onto that balcony. In the dream, he jumped to escape, and I followed. But in reality, I just stood there at the edge, motionless. Eventually, I retraced my steps, returned to my own room, and went back to bed. The next morning, I woke up to my grandma in a full-blown panic. Every door I had gone through was wide open, and the keys were scattered across the floor. She was convinced someone had broken into both units—until she checked the security cameras and realized it had been me.

To this day, I wonder if there was something more to it. My dreams always felt eerily vivid, like I was watching myself from the outside, as if something was guiding me. Thankfully, that was the last time it ever happened—at least, as far as I know.
