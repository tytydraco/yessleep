Lately, my friends and I have taken to gathering in one spot to spend time as a group. It’s very pleasant. One could liken us to a pack of wolves or a murder of crows. Those sound more intimidating than “a gaggle of humans”. Kit Sutton went back to stay over at Nettie Peterson’s place last night, and we’d all agreed to meet up at the diner today, of course with the exception of Mary Markov. She’d been pleased with the outcome of the whole affair, saying that since no one except Kit’s father had gotten hurt, it had all ended acceptably. I still got the impression that she was glad to be rid of us at the end of the night.

So earlier today, I was sitting at our usual table at Tom’s together with Elijah Carter. Frankie was by our side for the most part, neglecting the increasingly impatient customers waiting to be served in favor of talking to us. 

“I can’t believe Kit’s really back,” I remarked, rhetorically of course.

“I hope it actually *is* Kit,” Eli murmured. “This whole paranormal shit is messing with my head, man. Not like I didn’t have anxiety before, but now I keep thinking maybe everyone I know is an impostor. I mean, I don’t actually believe it, but…”

“Oh, I get it,” Frankie said. “The world’s crappy and dangerous as shit. It’s healthy to be wary. But you gotta be angry, not scared. You can channel anger. Fear is just gonna eat you up.”

“Sure, Blondie,” Eli replied, grinning faintly.

“Anyways, I really think it’s her,” I told them with confidence, looking up when I saw a flash of blue outside. I pointed my chin at it to alert the others. They looked up at the exact right moment to see Kit Sutton run right into the glass door, leaving a whole face print as she pulled back. She looked equal parts embarrassed and affronted, as though the door had offended her personally by not being open.

“Yeah, no, definitely her,” I added, taking a sip of my coconut water.

We watched as Nettie appeared behind her, opening the door and wheedling her in. We scooted over to make room in the booth as they sat down beside us. “How was your night?” I asked stiffly, not especially caring to hear the particulars. 

“We f—,” Kit began, beaming like a UV lamp. Nettie’s sneaker connecting sideways with her shin caused her to fall silent. It had been under the table, but I’d heard it anyway. “It’s been just fine,” my savior human answered brightly. 

“You’re very clever,” Frankie told her.

Nettie smiled uncertainly, a bit taken aback. The waiter leaned over to whisper in my ear, “Let’s hope her brains make up for the bobble-head’s lack of ‘em in the long run.”

I wheezed out a laugh. “Bobble-head,” I repeated happily, sputtering as I struggled to take another sip of my drink.

“You’re corrupting her,” my savior human hissed at Frankie. “You’re talking smack to her, aren’t you? You got that look on. And why aren’t you working?”

“That’s easy; I’m a terrible waiter.”

“So I actually went down to the beach again this morning,” Kit hurried to change the topic before Nettie could get any angrier. “My mom’s… actually a really cool lady. I wouldn’t have thought, but I think I might end up liking her a lot. She wanted reign over the ocean, you know; always did. That’s why my father locked her in. Now that she’s got it, everyone’s groveling to her, including my shithead brother. Feels good.” She treated us to a wide smirk. “Anyways, unlike my Dad, she never wants to relinquish power, so she’s totally fine with me living on land. She’s asked me to visit, though. Says she wants a connection with me, like an actual mother-daughter-relationship—if I’m up for it. I think I am.”

“Aww,” Eli uttered, looking warmed. “That’s kinda sweet.”

She nodded eagerly. “It actually is. I’m so freaking happy, like you wouldn’t believe. It’s super weird, though. She’s not as ancient as my Dad, and she can speak human, but she’s still, like, this massive giant ocean lady. I had no idea any deep one could be so cool.” Looking at me, she added, “She wants to talk to you, by the way. You and the leader of the witches who released her. To say thanks.”

I gave her a little nod. “I could do that, I suppose.”

“Great! We can go today,” Kit said, mirroring my nod with double the eagerness.

“I’ll go ask Rhonda,” Frankie conceded, rising from his seat and skirting around the tables into the kitchen.

The three of us headed down to the beach that same afternoon, Rhonda having taken a longer break to accompany us. She’d been relatively unfazed by the request, though she said she was looking forward to conversing with an ocean deity. “This kind of thing doesn’t happen very often,” she told us as we got on our way. The wind was blowing gently, the afternoon sun shining down placidly. It was warmer than the day before, and more people were outside, reveling in the bright daylight. 

“This is actually gonna be a bit of a walk now,” Kit announced as she tied her jacket around her waist. “Mom told me to come to the lagoon.”

“I didn’t know there was a lagoon nearby,” I said.

“It’s a tad harder to find,” she replied. “It’s around where the beach sorta goes into the forest. She used to hang out there all the time before that old dickhead captured her. Now that I think about it, I actually get why he did that to her. She did want to take away his territory.”

“Did he know that from the start?” Rhonda asked. “Because, no offense, I’m a bit confused as to why they’d choose to have kids together.”

“I’m not,” Kit answered, tossing her now choppy, chin-length hair. “Rivalry breeds sexual tension.”


“Does it?” I asked, raising a dubious brow.

“Oh, totally. In most cases.” She shrugged. “It’s a thing. You wouldn’t get it.”

“It sounds dumb to me, but that’s on par.”

My roommate snickered and shoved me in that way people sometimes shove each other without meaning real harm. “So. Rhonda.” She turned to regard the waitress. “You and your coven. What’s the deal?”

“Whatever do you mean?” the older woman asked back, stepping nimbly over a small rock in her path as we began to clamber down the cliffside.

“I mean, it was a pretty big shock seeing you in my cave, all… all occult-like. What’s a bunch of witches doing working at a diner? If I had magical powers, I’d create money and fame for myself and make everyone buy my music.”

“You do have magical powers,” I reminded her.

“Duh. Useless water ones.”

“Well, I got into witchcraft pretty early on in life,” Rhonda began. “My parents were deeply religious, which drove me right into the arms of evil.” She gave us a droll smirk. “Like attracts like, and that’s how I found my girlfriends. We met over the years, all at different points in our lives, but once we got together, we damn well *stayed* together. We moved out here because it’s solitary and we wanted to be left alone.” She gestured at my roommate and me. “You can see how well that’s worked out for us. Anyways, you wouldn’t believe it but when you’re a magic user, your life can end up being a bit on the doom-and-gloom side of things. After a while, you just want normalcy. We were hoping for some relaxed, mundane job, and Tom’s Diner was just opening up, so we flocked there. Sure, we weren’t always the only people working there—others came and went, but we stayed on.

“Problem was, Tom sucked as a boss. Expected us to come in last minute, interrupted our vacations, pocketed our tips… He was an asshole. So one day, we ganged up on him, all six of us. Told him he’d either show us some damn respect or we’d see to it that he did. He did try to placate us, but he was being extra slimy about it. We should’ve known he’d go back to how things were. One month later, he was pulling the same crap again, and when we confronted him, he threatened to fire each and every one of us. So he had to go.” Rhonda smiled to herself, blinking into the sun as she adjusted her braided updo. “What’s great about having a coven is that everyone can have a field they’re quote unquote specialized in. Our craft is vast and manifold; there’s no way any one magic user could have it all at their disposal.

“We each practice what we’re most comfortable with. I’m good with warding off spells, Hailey has a lot of experience with telepathy and awareness—opening your other eye and such. Mae-Lynn has her crystals, Aliyah is fond of herbs and nature… I am, too, but she’s better at it. Paloma is all about summoning and ritualistic sacrifice. She relies on the Old Gods and some demons she’s done business with for her magic. We don’t have to go into the nitty-gritty of things, but yeah, that’s us. We’re strong enough on our own, and together… together, we can do a great many things.

“We decided Tom’s fate for him. We confined him to his office… in our own way. He still does the work he’s meant to do, but let’s be real—we’re the ones in charge. It’s much better this way.” With a stretch of her arms that had her shoulders cracking, she ended her retelling. 

“Woah,” Kit said eloquently.

“I would not want to cross your group,” I told her, feeling more than a bit impressed.

“I should hope not,” Rhonda replied, suddenly more serious. “Because Frankie might not be a witch, but he’s part of us, too. I hope we understand each other.”

“If you’re insinuating disrespectful intentions towards your adoptee, I can assure you, I have none.”

“Oh. Yeah, well, I was trying to be subtle about it.”

“Eva’s not exactly one for subtlety,” Kit stage-whispered to the other woman.

“I’ve noticed.” Rhonda gave me a brief once-over. “I like you just fine. I don’t have any issues with you… nothing immediate, at any rate. But that boy’s been through a lot, the kind of shit that might have a lesser person offing themself. That might be crass, but it’s just how it is. Don’t add to that.”

“I don’t plan to. I adore him.”

“*Adore*? You *adore* him?”

“Any objections to my choice of words?”

Rhonda pulled a face. “It’s a big word, is all.”

I shrugged. “It’s a big feeling.”

We walked on in silence for a moment before I gave voice to a related concern of mine. “Did you notice anything off about Frankie?”

“Besides him being a living, talking sex doll?” Rhonda clarified.

“Yes.”

“Well… tall order. But yes. We… we did. There’s lots of things. Weirdly enough, none of my girls can make sense of him. We’ve been trying to, but there’s almost, like… a wall around him. There’s something underneath, we all keep getting that feeling. The only thing we can say for sure, though, is that after his arrival, practicing certain spells was a lot easier. Like he was acting as a booster of some sort.” She shook her head. “We’ve refrained from looking into it too obviously. We didn’t want him to feel uncomfortable around us.”

I nodded. Having gotten what I could out of that particular thread of conversation, I focused on following Kit Sutton through the mud and brushes once more. We’d left the beach behind and were now heading towards the tall pines beyond. They reached high up into the sky, their tips disappearing in the blinding shimmer of afternoon brightness. “We’re close,” Kit told us. She continued to steer us towards a sort of clearing. Except it wasn’t actually a clearing. It was a round, nearly perfectly circular lake barely separated from the sea by a low sandbank on the side near the shore. The other end, the one in the direction we were coming from, was spotty, wet woodland. The sunlight was playing upon the ripples curling the large stretch of water, offering a beautiful sight.

Rhonda glanced about, looking similarly pleased. “Pretty,” she muttered. “I can’t believe I’ve never come out here before.”

“Hardly anyone does,” my roommate declared, stepping up to the water’s edge. Her worn black boots sank slightly into the sand. She spoke up once more, but this time, it was in Adma’ai. The water started to shift immediately in response, the surface bursting when the head of a woman emerged. The lake had to be far deeper than it looked. The head filled up almost its entirety, and despite the arguable appeal of the face that looked back at us, I sucked in a sharp breath. Kit’s mother was even larger than I’d thought, now that I was seeing her up close. A chill ran down my spine at the sheer size of the two sea-green eyes trained upon me. They were eerily beautiful, though not quite human—a thin coat of translucent slime seemed to stretch over her eyeballs behind her lids, creating a mildly repulsive squelching sound as she blinked.

She parted her lips to speak, revealing two rows of pointy, shark-like teeth. "You're back, runiha."

Kit flushed. "That's a nickname," she muttered. "For, like, a young child."

"I figured it was a term of endearment," I supplied. 

Clearing her throat, Kit looked up at her mother. "This is Eva and Rhonda."

"Yes," the giantess mumbled, her voice melodious and full. "The witch and the traveler." An enormous hand parted the surface of the lake, coming out to very gently prod my side. "I have not seen a creature such as you in a long, long time."

“You’ve met other dimension hoppers?”

“Oh yes. One used to come to me quite often, back in the day. We talked a lot. I suppose we were friends,” she said softly, as if trying the word on for size. “When she couldn’t bear it anymore, this dreary existence here on earth, she asked me to put an end to it for her. I carry her with me still, deep inside.”

“You ate her?” Kit cried.

“What would you have had me do? She was dear to me and wanted to find a dignified end,” her mother replied. “Life in this place is hard for outsiders.” She threw me a pointed, sympathetic glance. “Is that not so, small one?”

“I’ve had a relatively pleasant experience,” I argued.

“I’m glad to hear that. It seems to be a rarity. Many others shrivel and wither, so far away from their own kind.” A sad smile flickered across her face. “There is something I must show you all. My consort, though captured, is far from harmless. He has been saying certain things… concerning things. I may be a Queen now, but I am younger than he is, and ever so much more unschooled in these matters. May I rely on you for advice?”

Rhonda and I exchanged puzzled glances before she took a step forward, nodding her affirmation. Kit’s mother smiled again, flipping her hand to expose her palm. “Allow me.”

The three of us carefully climbed on top of it, only for her other hand to come up and close above us, forming a dripping, spacious dome. My eyes were naturally drawn to the translucent webbing between her fingers. It kept the water from spilling in while at the same time allowing us to see outside like we were looking through a window. We watched as Kit’s mother sank down beneath the surface, cautiously carrying us through darkening masses of water. We slipped through a hole deep beneath the sandbank out into the open sea, and then into the mouth of an underwater rock formation closer to shore. We swam up until, to my surprise, the water didn’t follow us anymore. The giantess sat us down on the rough ground, and the first thing I did upon stepping off her palm was take a deep breath.

We were in an odd, eerily beautiful hollow. An assortment of strange pink and blue plants coated the stone walls. There was a single large opening on the eastern side of the cavern, leading off to what looked to be an even bigger room. It seemed to be lying in complete darkness with only a dim, uncanny blue light disrupting the pitch-black. 

The giant lady tilted her head at the arch. “Go. He’s inside, tied down by his own offspring. They were very obedient once I made it clear who’d taken charge. I will wait here for you, I can’t follow.”

That much was obvious, considering her size. “So how safe do we think is it, talking to that guy?” Rhonda asked under her breath as we neared the mouth of the prison room. 

“Have you seen his size?” Kit replied. “If he tears loose, we’ll just run back out here. He won’t fit.”

“I can see myself regretting this already,” the waitress muttered as we crossed the threshold. 

There was a massive shape looming in the darkness, bent and crooked, his limbs twisted and broken to fit into the limited confines of the cave. The former King’s skin was giving off a faint glow, just enough to illuminate his large face. I instantly shrank back when I saw it, feeling bile rise in my throat. It was doughy, an amalgam of the visage of a human and a catfish. His dripping cheeks looked like they were flowing off his head, the weird slimy strings hanging down from it quivering as though moved by an invisible current. His big, glassy eyes were bulging from his head. The thin spikes of his back were pressed up against the ceiling, and one of his arms appeared to be broken by the way it limply hung off his side.

I felt slightly dizzy, but I tried not to show it. Stepping in front of my roommate, I allowed her to shuffle into my shadow. She peeked nervously over my shoulder. 

*"Chandra."*

The resounding voice of the toppled monarch bounced off the walls in an echo that shook me to my core. Kit Sutton grabbed my upper arm, leaning forward but not coming out. "No more of that," she called out, obviously straining to keep her composure. "No more Chandra. Just… just stop."

*"What do you think you're doing?"* the beast thundered. *"My daughter doesn't grovel. My daughter doesn't hide. Stand before me, pretend you have some pride."*

"Well, I won't," Kit bellowed with conviction. 

"Leave her be," I commanded, trying to assume some semblance of authority.

*"Hear, hear. It talks."* The creature drew in a rattling wheeze of a breath. *"So you are the traveler."*

"I am."

*"You must be glad for this outcome."*

"I am," I repeated.

*"I didn't know the kind of creatures my daughter spent her time on. Then again, I did not expect much better. Tell me, foreigner, do you enjoy seeing a being such as myself this way? In my experience, your kind despises the earthly ones.”*

“I have no opinions on beings like you whatsoever. I do take some pleasure in your misery, but only for what you did to my friend.”

A hissing, grating sound filled my ears, and it took me a second to realize he was laughing. *“You like this, do you? Very well. You won’t like what’s coming next.”*

Now we were getting somewhere. “What’s next, then?” Rhonda asked, her tone light and unflappable.

*“You, little creature, call yourself Evangeline. Do you even remember the name you once went by? Or that of your majestic race?”*

My whole body froze, every last muscle I had locking hard. “What the hell do you know about my people?”

*“Enough. You are impertinent to assume you were the first of your kind to arrive here. The sea has seen visitors from all dimensions. The water that cradles the skies has guided many a traveler into our midst, however brief their stay. I am water, the mirror of the earth, and thus I see all. Do you wish to know what I see in your future?”*

*No. No, please, no.* “What?” I hissed.

The monstrous entity leaned down, bringin one large, milky eye to the same level as my face. *“The one who feasts eternally. The Devourer of Worlds. You escaped him once, but next time, it will not be as easy.”*

For a moment, all I could do was stand and stare. I was stricken, unable to speak, unable to move. “You’re lying,” I pressed out. I had meant to say it in a strong, confident way, but my bone-dry throat couldn’t even make it past a whisper. My mind was screaming at me, my thoughts racing.

*“You know I’m doing no such thing, my dear child. I may have lost a fight yesterday, but I have come to accept my powerlessness. This planet, this dimension with you, me, my disappointment of a daughter and everyone else within will soon be forgotten, swallowed by the one who knows but gluttony. He is coming. You may outrun him yet again, but what use will it be? You have tried to adapt, I see that. You have adopted a form so unsuspectingly human that you may have deceived yourself along with the rest of them.”* He brought his foul-smelling head even closer to mine. *“And thus, history will repeat itself. You will watch as all you hold dear disappears before your very eyes all over again.”*

*No.* My entire nervous system felt like it had been hot-wired. Every single one of his words sent me further into my quiet panic. Images raced before my inner eyes, both memories and the most horrid nightmares turned vivid and colorful as they mingled and mixed. 

*“He will come, he will come soon, so very soon. He’ll listen to the reptile’s call. He will find us. There is nothing you can do to mend it.”*

“Stop it!” Kit yelled, but it sounded like she was miles away, her cry a distant breeze grazing my ear. I stared ahead, vacant, empty, numb. “What are you doing to her? You disgusting piece of shit…”

*“It’s the truth, my little one.”*

“It’s not!” she screamed, her voice brittle with tears. “It’s not, you’re just… you’re just messing with us, you bastard. Is this your idea of a threat? Is it?”

*“It’s my idea of a prophecy.”*

That was when I lost control. Before I even knew what I was doing, I was lunging at him, fangs bared and tentacles flailing. I pushed myself off the ground with all my might, plunging into the murky surface that was his eye and digging my protruding teeth into it. He let out a howl of agony, the sound bubbling up from deep within his stomach. His sound arm, obviously not sufficiently bound, reached up to grab me. I wailed when I felt his long, bony fingers wrap around my midriff, plucking me off effortlessly before hurling me across the room. My back collided with the hard wall behind us, the pain hitting me in a blunt, instantaneous surge. I let out a muffled whimper as I fell to the ground, rolling onto my stomach.

“We’re getting out *right now*! Come on!” Kit shouted. “Fuck you,” she spat at her father, her tone laced with pure venom, more potent than her terror.

Rhonda was already by my side, having pulled me to my feet and steering me towards the exit. I was panting and weeping, a coiled, shaken mess as my roommate’s mother hurried to carry us back onto dry land. There, in the arms of the waitress, I collapsed like a heap of sand. 

Everything that happened after was kind of a blur. Kit Sutton brought me home and laid me down in my bed, tucking me in with a level of care I had not thought her capable of. I don’t know what I expected going into this. I hadn’t thought it would be about me in any way; I’d figured Kit’s father merely wanted to verbally abuse her some more. I’m a little better now, or at least I’m clearer in the head. The message the former King wanted to convey was perfectly direct. I wish I could chalk it up to miscommunication, but I believe that to be out of the question at this point. This is something that’s happening. So I’m basically sharing an important piece of news here.

Heads-up, the world is going to end…

I might not have to worry about finding a new job after all. Then again, I might just try and do something. The Devourer has been following the reptile’s call, after all, and I do know someone who means to bring about the apocalypse. I guess I should have taken them more seriously.
