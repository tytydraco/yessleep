When I was a kid, we lived in a small, isolated house on the edge of a half-developed neighborhood. There were only about six houses on our block, and ours was the last one before many overgrown weeds and empty land stretched out into the dark. At night, the area was deserted, and you’d rarely see anyone stepping outside. I lived there from the ages of 7 to 13 and looking back, it felt like I was trapped inside one of those disturbing, uncanny horror films where reality always seems just a little bit off

Before I dive into the incidents, it’s worth mentioning that our life in that house was filled with a sense of suffocating dread. Financially, we struggled a lot during those years, drowning in debt. Strangely enough, things turned around for us as soon as we moved out. Family fights erupted daily, and I remember feeling terrified constantly, I remember not going too far into any room so that if anything jumps out I could run though the door easily(idk why I did that tbh)

Here are some of the events that made me believe that something was haunting us:

**Incident 1: The Unseen Watcher**

I remember staying home from school one day because I was sick. I was curled up on the couch, watching *Barney & Friends*, trying to distract myself from the eerie feeling of the house. At some point, I felt someone standing beside me. I assumed it was my mom joining me to watch the show, so I didn't think much of it. A few minutes passed, and I casually asked her something. There was no response. i asked her one more time and there was no response again I turned to find no one there. That’s when it hit me—my mom wasn’t even home; she had left for work hours ago and I was completely alone in the house. this freaked me out and i opened the front door and sat on the porch until my parents came home cus it felt soo real. it felt like someone was actually there

**Incident 2: The Yellow Ball and the Swarm**

this incident happened to my sister but ill explain it in my pov. We all used to sleep in the same room since our house only had one bedroom, and Ime and my sister would sleep in between my parents to feel safe. One night my sister was studying for her test int he living room and, around 12:30 AM, i was starting to fall asleep when suddenly my sister busts thought the door running and jumped on the bed scared and was crying. after calming her down, she told us what had happened. She was in the living room studying for a test when, out of nowhere, a yellow ball with a smiley face on it rolled to the hallway from the other room and as it came to a stop, dozens of cockroaches scurried out from the same room, like they do when they hear humans walking. (Our house had a serious cockroach problem; the floors practically came alive with them at night.). She said a heavy sense of dread washed over her as she stared into the dark hallway. Then, she saw it—a shadowy figure emerging from the darkness, moving in a way that made her feel cold all over. she told us that she felt stuck for a second and froze in fear before running to the bedroom

**Incident 3: The Disappearing Glasses**

One morning, my dad couldn’t find his glasses. He had recently undergone cataract surgery, so they were essential. The whole family spent what felt like hours scouring every inch of the house. We checked his shelf multiple times, which was where he usually kept them, but they were nowhere to be found.

We left for school, defeated and convinced that the glasses were gone for good. But later that evening, as we were sitting around, my dad suddenly called out to my mom, sounding almost angry. We rushed over to find the glasses sitting right there on the shelf—exactly where we had checked over and over again. My dad thought we were playing a prank on him, but we weren’t. There was no explanation for how they could’ve reappeared like that. and it wasn't him pranking us either cus he was so mad that day

**Incident 4: The Mysterious Fortune Teller**

ok so this one is actually scary so strap in. how would you feel if a random creepy looking guy stood in front of your house and started chanting. well In South Indian culture, there's a figure known as the *Kudugudupu Karan*. I've not heard much about them but they are like devotees of god who roam the streets and randomly tell fortunes to people, but most people avoid him, fearing that his predictions might bring misfortune. My first encounter with one of them was when I was young. I remember hearing a man singing some kind of a religious song near our doorstep like literally few meters away from our door and I went to check on it but my mom quickly grabbed me form the back and told me to be silent and not to make any sound, we pretended like there was nobody home and eventually he went away I was so confused and asked my mom who he was but she didn't explain and just brushed it off

Years later, as the strange happenings in our house grew more intense, a similar figure began appearing near our house while my dad was home alone. For several days, this man stood near our door, chanting and seemingly delivering cryptic messages AT NIGHT. Finally, my dad confronted him, telling him to stay away. I never saw the man again after that, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that his presence was somehow connected to the disturbances.

**Incident 5: The Chanting Yogi**

My sister also had recurring nightmares while we lived there. She remembers one in particular that terrified her—she would wake up to a vivid vision of a figure, like a yogi or a mystic, sitting on her chest, chanting in an unknown language. She could feel his weight pressing down on her, making it almost impossible to breathe. This vision plagued her until we left that house for good.

We finally moved out of that place, and to our relief, the strange experiences almost entirely stopped. Our financial situation improved, the family conflicts became less frequent, and that constant, creeping fear seemed to lift. I can't explain what was happening in that house, but living there always felt like I was stuck in a disturbing horror film, one that I desperately wanted to escape.

Reddit, do you think there could have been something paranormal going on, or was it just the atmosphere of that place getting to us? And if you’d like to hear more stories from that house, let me know—I have plenty more.
