It’s strange how the tiniest things can ignite a storm inside a person. Like the radio blaring through heavy traffic, its static crackling in the claustrophobic silence. I won’t have to listen to my dad’s complaints about it anymore. Outside the window, the cars inch forward in a sluggish crawl, the city’s skyline fading behind us. My mom sits beside me, her voice almost a whisper as she hums along, forcing herself to sing—probably to drown out the memories of my dad’s constant silence. Tommy, my little brother, is in the back, fingers flying over the screen playing Roblox, oblivious to the weight of everything. He’s just about to turn nine, still trying to grasp why Mom and Dad aren’t together anymore. I don’t want to spoil his innocence with my own worries. As we edge closer to the outskirts of town, I notice Mom’s nose scrunching and her hands tightening on the wheel, her knuckles white. This move—this new start—it's a hard road for anyone, especially her.

“Where’s your charger?” Tommy asked.

“It’s in one of the boxes in the trunk, I think,” I replied. You would’ve thought I just hurt a dog in front of Tommy the way he reacted.  

“Why are we moving so far from Dad?! Is he coming with us later?” Tommy screamed.  

“No honey, your dad and I love you very much, but we’re having a difficult time right now,” my mom tried to comfort Tommy.  

As Tommy was sniffing his tears away, I reached in my pocket and gave him a Chief Wahoo pin. My dad loves Cleveland baseball, and he would always take Tommy to the games. I wish just once he would take me. Giving Tommy that pin reminded him of Dad and brought him just enough comfort to pull himself together.  

We’ve been driving for thirty minutes and haven’t seen a single restaurant or grocery store—just a Dollar General and deer crossing signs. That’s what most of Ohio consisted of outside of the city.  

Finally, we pull into our new home, surrounded by woods. It’s nothing fancy, just a humble three-bedroom, two-story house. We stretch as we get out of the car and just stand, staring, in silence.  

Mom broke the silence by saying, “C'mon boys! Let's see your new rooms!”  

It was nice to think that I was finally going to have my own room. Tommy and I had to share a room, and most of the time share a bed. Not because we only had one bed, but because sometimes we heard Mom and Dad fighting, and Tommy would be scared and slip into my bed while I was sleeping.  

Breaking free of the trance, I shake my head and grab my bag from the car. I pat Tommy on the back, and we make our way up the old wooden porch. From what I was guessing, I would say this house was built in the 60s—based on the house’s chipping paint, creaky wooden porch, and vintage window curtains. But again, I’m excited for this new chapter. Well, not really excited, but intrigued.  

When Mom finally pushed open the front door, I braced myself for chaos—broken furniture, trash strewn across the floor, signs of a hurried abandonment. Instead, I was met with an unnerving stillness. The house felt frozen in time, as if the owners had simply disappeared, leaving everything exactly as it was—furniture draped in ghostly layers of dust, curtains hanging limp and yellowed, swaying faintly as if disturbed by an unseen breeze. The stale air clung to my skin, thick with the scent of neglect and forgotten memories. Every step I took echoed unnaturally loud in the oppressive silence, like the house was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

I help Tommy with his bags as he runs upstairs to see his new room. I throw mine over my shoulder and head up the stairs. *Pop-ching! Pop-ching!* I freeze. These steps—they don’t even creek when I step on them. They… well, I’ve never heard steps that make that noise.  

“Mom!” I shout. “Watch what happens when I walk on these steps.”  

*Pop-ching!* As I put my weight on the first step.  

“Huh, that’s unique!” My mom then turns away to continue unpacking boxes. I have a feeling that bothers her too, but she’s trying to stay positive. So I don’t say anything either—I’ll just have to put up with the odd noise. I’ll have to figure out another way to sneak out at night.  

I reach the top of the stairs to see one single hallway where all three bedroom doors meet. I enter the first one to see Tommy looking out the window.  

“Hey buddy, wanna help me unpack your games?” I ask him.  

But he’s just staring out the window.  

“Tommy?” I ask again.  

“Oh, sorry, I was looking at that old barn out there,” he replied.

“The old barn?” I look outside to see a leaning wooden barn, about half the size of the house. “Maybe we can check it out after we unpack.” I say, trying to get Tommy to help me.  

Like a conductor on stage, Tommy told me where and how exactly he wanted his toys—how to face them and what position they should be in.  

“My pin!” Tommy yelled as he frantically checked his pockets.  

“Don’t worry, we’ll find it. You just had it; it can’t be far,” I reassured him.  

After scouring his room, I figured it was in the car, when I gave it to him. I walk down the *unique* stairs and go outside. I open the rear passenger door and see it on the floor.  

As I close the door, Tommy yells from my bedroom window, “Was it there?!”  

“Go Indians!” I jokingly say as I lift up the pin.  

Suddenly, a faint voice sliced through the silence—distorted, broken, like a record scratched beyond repair. It was close enough to make my skin crawl, yet distant enough to be dismissed as a neighbor. But I knew better. The voice was warped, fragments of words drifting in and out, echoing with unnatural echo. My mind spun, trying to find sense in the fractured sounds. ‘Did we even have neighbors?’ I wondered, trembling. ‘Or is something else here—something that shouldn’t be?’ The voice’s strange, broken cadence sent icy shivers down my spine, each word a jagged shard of a nightmare I couldn’t wake from.   

“You moved my bed wrong.” Tommy instructed me from my bedroom, which broke me out of my deep thoughts.

“Get out of my room.” I plainly say as I walk inside.  

Nothing was in my room; I was just tired of getting bossed around by an almost nine-year-old.



The first night passed, and now the house had a mix of the old furniture from the previous owner and the items we brought. Mom is very happy that she doesn’t have to buy new couches or lamps, since I know she can’t afford them.  

I decided to crash on the old couch, as I didn’t get a full night’s rest. I woke up last night with Tommy asking if he could sleep with me. The old springs groaned loudly beneath me as I plummeted onto the sagging couch, its rusted coils protesting with a squeal.

We really didn’t bring much furniture—since we didn’t have any—but one thing we did bring was the TV. I turned on *The Sopranos*, and before I knew it, I was extremely tired.  

I woke up to see Cleveland Baseball on the TV, but Tommy was nowhere to be found. Annoyed, I get up and look for Tommy. *Pop-ching! Pop-ching! Pop-ching!* as I run up the stairs.  

“If you’re going to change the channel, at least be there to watch it!” I yell as I turn the corner into Tommy’s room. But he’s not there.  

I walk up to his window and look out into the backyard, where I see him just as he enters the barn. Curious about what Tommy was doing, I head downstairs so I can follow him. I exit the front door and slowly start to make my way to the backyard. At this point, I realize that I never took in the surroundings outside of the house. I glance at the peeling siding and chipped paint, but I don't look at it with disgust. I'm almost in awe that the outside of the house is basically falling apart, yet we find the inside untouched.

*BAM!* “What the—?” As I was looking at the house, I seemed to run into an old dog house. Just like the outside of our home, the dog house has seen better days. It has white siding and a red-painted roof, which is chipping. Right above the entrance, I see a painted-on bone with a name written on it. “Samson,” I mumble under my breath. No sign of any dog here.

I pick up my pace and jog to the barn. I stop before walking through the open doors of the barn to appreciate how it's still standing, even though it has an impressive lean. “Tommy?” I nervously ask. With no response, I enter the barn. The rusty tools clink softly as I brush past them, their jagged edges catching what little light filtered in. The air inside the barn was thick with the scent of mold, old hay, and decay. I could feel the rough, cold wood of the beams beneath my fingertips and hear the distant drip of water echoing through the stale silence. Straw covers the ground, and there are soggy bales of hay that look like they were placed 40 years ago. A drip of water falls on the bridge of my nose, startling me. I look up to see more sky than roof.

"Tommy, seriously, come on." My voice edged with impatience as I scanned the barn. Two horse stalls sit against the weathered wood, the first one creaking softly. I hear a faint rustling from inside. "Dude," I say, more sharply now, stepping closer. The gate is closed, but the wood has been rotted thin, gaps opening like broken teeth. I lean in, squinting. There—an eye glints back at me through the cracks. My stomach tightens. I jump back, slipping on the damp hay sprawled across the ground, and stumble onto the dirt.

I hear a burst of laughter, It’s Tommy, pushing open the gate with a grin. I glare at him, trying to catch my breath.

"Yeah, real funny," I mutter, “What are you doing here?” 

“You told me to come in here! I heard you call me out here, but I couldn't find you, so I thought we were playing a game. Remember when you said we could explore the barn after we put my things away?”

“Uh, yeah, I guess I did say that,” I replied. I rub my eyes and head, feeling a mix of confusion and the aftereffects of the fall.

“C'mon, let's go inside,” I say as I rub his back.

“Wanna watch baseball with me, Jonathan?!” Tommy asked me eagerly.

“Sure, buddy.” I replied.



The room was cloaked in darkness, the only sound was my steady breathing and the TV commercials. Despite the silence, a strange comfort washed over me—this rare quiet, broken only by distant creaks and the whisper of the wind outside, made me feel like I was finally alone in this haunted place. It's only the second week of being here—in our new house, in our new life. Not surprisingly, baseball is on the TV. It's not even a live game; it's a rerun. Just having the game on in the background reminds Tommy of Dad. Tommy never saw the side of Dad I saw. He only saw the side that took him to games and bought him a hotdog.

I sit in the old recliner in the living room, next to the couch. I look into the kitchen and see the back door, and notice something odd about it. The back door was a fortress—no window to see outside, just three heavy locks securing it. The thick, dark wood seemed to absorb the moonlight, leaving the house feeling more like a prison than a home. I wondered who had built it like this—what secrets did those locks hide? Now that I notice that, I realize there are no windows on the ground floor. But who knows what they were thinking when they built this house in the '60s. Maybe it had something to do with the Cold War.

I relax as I watch the rerun alone. Mom was asleep after a long day of work, and Tommy was in his room doing who knows what. What I was most excited about in our new lives was the quiet. You’d be surprised how stressful it was, living all together—listening to Dad try to sneak out with his latest woman, slipping through the kitchen like a thief, while Mom yelled at him from the front door. Sometimes, it was a guy. Over time, you stop reacting. You go numb. Mom fell into that same trap. But thankfully, my aunt helped her break free.

I jolt upright from the chair, gasping, sweat sticking to my skin. I must’ve dozed off. The TV flickers with an old shopping commercial; I switch it off and stand. As I turn toward the stairs, I catch it—a muffled voice, faint but strange: “Watchhhhhh… baseball?” My heart skips. I freeze. That’s Tommy outside, right? But it doesn’t sound like him. It’s like he’s learning to talk again—mumbling, uncertain, almost like a toddler. I rub my eyes, trying to shake the fog. But I can’t go check the window—there are no windows here.

I wait and wait, but nothing happens. “Maybe Tommy was sleep talking? Or it was still part of my dream,” I ask myself in my head. I finally decide to head up to my room, so I turn around and go up the stairs. Damn, I totally forgot that we have *unique* stairs. I'll have to try my best to be as quiet and light as possible when I take these steps. I carefully place my foot on the first step. *Pop-ching!* The sound rings out sharply in the silence. My stomach tightens. I freeze, holding my breath. The noise echoes unnaturally loud. I quickly shift my weight against the wall, trying to muffle the sound, but the *Pop-ching!* repeats, each step feeling heavier with dread.

“Hello? What’s going on?” Mom’s voice is groggy, fogged with exhaustion.

I hang my head, feeling defeated. “Sorry, Mom—I fell asleep downstairs. Just... tired.” I hate robbing her of the little sleep she gets lately.

She offers a faint, tired smile. “It’s okay, honey. I’ll see you in the morning.”  

I force a faint smile and hurriedly climb the creaky stairs. *Pop-ching! Pop-ching!* Each step sounds like a scream in the silent house. I grit my teeth. “Why do these stupid stairs sing every time I step on them?” I mutter, my voice edged with irritation.  I stumble into my room and collapse onto the bed. The only light filters in through the window—an icy blue glow from the moon. My body aches from exhaustion, but a faint shiver still runs down my spine from that dream—Tommy’s voice echoing strange and distorted. I sit up stiffly, pulling the curtains closed, shutting out the darkness and trying to shake off the unease.



It’s been a month since we moved, and today marks the day Tommy’s been counting down to since we arrived. The day Dad finally takes him to a Cleveland Indians game. From the moment the sun rose, Tommy’s been bursting with energy—wearing his Indians jersey and cap, talking nonstop about the game like it’s the biggest event of his life. Meanwhile, I feel a quiet knot in my stomach—this is the day Mom’s least looked forward to: seeing her ex-husband again.

I don’t feel much about Dad—no anger, no warmth. It’s like he’s a stranger I pass in the hall. And I’m pretty sure he feels the same. But if Tommy’s smile can be because of him, then maybe that’s enough. I slip into the kitchen, peeking around the corner just enough to hear Mom talking softly on the phone. Her voice is calm, but I catch certain words—her mentioning a date with her ex. I stop, pressing my back against the wall, trying not to make a sound. It’s almost shocking—only a month out of love, and she’s already talking about dating again? Or maybe she’d fallen out of love long before she left him. The thought stings, sharper than I expected.

I step outside with Tommy, tossing the ball back and forth beneath the fading late-afternoon sky. The yard is quiet, save for the occasional laugh or thud of the ball. About fifteen minutes in, a strange voice cuts through the stillness: “Samson? Where areee...?” The words are drawn out, distorted, like they’re coming from far away, then abruptly cut off with a scratchy, static-like noise. 

As I turn to face where the voice came from, the ball hits me in the back of the neck, startling me and breaking the moment. 

“Sorry, Johnathan!” Tommy yells, his face pale with worry.  

I rub the spot where the ball hit, grimacing. “No, it’s okay,” I say, trying to keep my voice steady. “I thought we didn’t have neighbors around here.” 

Tommy tilts his head, eyes wide. “Maybe they’re looking for their dog?” he suggests softly, voice tentative.  

I glance in the direction where the old, weathered dog house sits in shadow. “There’s an old dog house back there,” I murmur, more to myself than him. A chill runs down my spine.  

Tommy hesitates, then asks quietly, “Should we go check?”

“No, let’s go inside,” I say quickly. I lock the door behind us, the click echoing in the quiet house. The air feels heavier now, shadows stretching across the walls. I flick on the TV, tuning into the game, trying to drown out the strange feeling crawling up my spine. Tommy plops onto the couch, eyes fixed on the screen, while I listen to Mom upstairs—still on the phone, her muffled voice drifting down.

I lean closer, catching snippets of her muffled voice upstairs. “I know! Maybe Pink?” she whispers, her tone tentative.  

“Well, you know...” she trails off, voice lowering to a whisper I can barely hear.  

“We did have that thing—what, nine years ago?” The words hang in the air, strange and out of place. My stomach tightens. What are they talking about?  

My heart leaps as Tommy suddenly appears beside me, eyes wide. “What’s nine years ago?” he asks innocently, but there’s a hint of curiosity I don’t like.  

I startle, turning sharply. “What are you doing? I thought you were watching the game,” I say, voice tight. Without thinking, I gently but firmly push him onto the couch, trying to mask my rising unease.

I hear the gravel beneath the driveway crunch loudly as a figure appears. Tommy’s eyes widened with anticipation. Without hesitation, he bolts outside, sprinting toward the battered Chevy parked at the edge of the yard.  

“Dad!” Tommy shouts, voice full of excitement.

Dad steps out of the car, a wide grin spreading across his face. “Tommy, my man! How’s my little buddy?” he calls, opening his arms.  

Tommy charges forward, launching himself into a hug. Dad ruffles his hair affectionately, a fleeting smile touching his lips—though I notice a flicker of something guarded in his eyes.

Dad approaches cautiously, voice hesitant. “Hey, Johnathan. How’s the new house treating you?”  

I shrug, trying to keep my tone neutral. “Fine.”  

He glances toward the house, then asks softly, “Where’s your mom?”  

“Upstairs,” I reply. He hesitates, then just settles onto the porch steps, watching the house but not going inside.

Suddenly, Dad raises his voice, calling out, “Heather! Heather! Come here!” His tone is casual but urgent, almost like he’s calling a lost dog.  

From upstairs, I hear Mom’s voice, soft but wary. “John, what is it?” she calls, peeking around the doorframe.  

Dad gestures impatiently. “Come here! Let me see you,” he insists, voice firm but strained.

“Bring him back before dark, please. We don’t have any street lamps down here,” Mom says sharply, turning away and heading upstairs.  

Dad mutters, “What a dump,” under his breath, then grabs Tommy by the shoulders. They climb into the battered sedan, and as they drive away, I catch Tommy waving at me through the window, a bright smile on his face. I raise my hand in return, forcing a smile of my own. But as soon as the car disappears down the road, that smile slips away, replaced by a heavy silence inside me.

Inside, I find Mom at the dining table, sweeping crumbs into a dustpan. I hesitate, then speak. “Mom, we heard that voice outside. It was weird—kind of scratchy, like it was far away but close at the same time.”  

She looks up, brushing her hair back. “Maybe it was just some hikers passing by. Could you put this box of your school papers downstairs?” she asks, her tone trying to sound casual but distracted.

As I descend into the basement, an eerie silence replaces the usual creaks and groans of the old stairs. These steps are older, more fragile, and strangely quiet—almost unnerving. I set the box down in a convenient corner, then turn back.  

Jackpot. An old cardboard box with “Memorabilia” written in Sharpie across the top. I sift through it, finding faded photographs and a few worn diaries. I pull out one, flipping through the pages—nothing exciting, just scribbles and memories. Since I left my PS4 at Dad’s, this will have to do for passing the time.

I climb back up the creaking stairs, glancing at the quiet, aged steps. Something about them bugs me—their silence, the way they seem so different from the loud, protesting steps I remember. I decide to figure out why the stairs going upstairs are so loud. I toss the diary onto the rickety coffee table, then head toward the small closet beneath the stairs. No light inside—just darkness. I fumble for my flashlight, flick it on, and the beam cuts through the gloom. My breath catches as I see what’s inside.

I kneel beneath the staircase, heart pounding. Tiny, almost invisible mechanisms are embedded just beneath each step—an intricate web of thin wires snaking across the wood. They’re connected to a small, rusted bell mounted on the wall, its surface mottled with age. My fingers tremble as I trace the delicate wires, realizing someone went to great lengths to set this trap. The faint metallic ping of the bell echoes softly in the silence, like a warning whisper.  

It’s no accident that these stairs don’t creak—every wire, every trigger, is carefully wired, a sinister alarm system designed to alert someone—or something—when I move. A cold shiver runs down my spine. Why? To wake the house when I sleep downstairs? To keep watch over me? My mind spirals with questions, each more unsettling than the last.

I rise slowly, my mind racing with everything I’ve just uncovered. I head upstairs, intending to tell Mom, but her muffled voice drifts down—she’s on the phone again, talking with her friend. I hesitate, listening for a moment, then decide to wait until she’s finished.  

Reluctantly, I go back downstairs, the house eerily quiet. I grab the old diary from the corner, settle onto the couch, and try to steady my nerves.
