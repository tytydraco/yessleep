Animal Control showed up within minutes, acting like they had been waiting for an excuse. They scanned him, photographed him, asked questions that didn't sound like they were about a dog at all. "Has he shown unusual awareness?" "Any imitation behaviors?" "Does he respond to mirrors?"



I begged them not to take him away. He wasn't violent, he was just scared that day. He'd never bitten anyone before.



That was when the older officer pulled me aside and mentioned a behavioral program, privately funded, experimental, no cost. "We can rehabilitate him," he said. "We can save him. But only if you consent."



I didn't read the packet. I didn't ask enough questions. I just signed.



They took him that afternoon. And he came home exactly six days later.



He looked like my dog. He moved like my dog. But the second he stepped through the door, I felt something in my body tense, like instinct recognizing that something familiar had been rearranged. The first change was the silence. He didn't bark. Not when the neighbor slammed their gate. Not when the mailman walked past. Not even when someone knocked directly on my door. Normally he barked so loudly the whole neighborhood could hear him. But now, nothing.



The second change was his eyes. He used to flick his gaze everywhere, following birds, shadows, toys. Now he stared only at me. Always at me. Not in that loving "I adore you" way. More like he was... memorizing something.



The third change was the routine. Or rather, my routine. If I woke up at 6:13, his eyes snapped open at 6:13. If I walked to the kitchen, he followed three steps behind. If I brushed my teeth, he sat in the exact same spot every single time, head tilted as if waiting for instructions. He ate only when I ate. He drank only when I poured water into his bowl. And whenever I went into the bathroom, he waited outside the door, silent, unmoving, like he was waiting for his turn.



But I kept telling myself he was just adjusting. Trauma, fear, confusion. Anything ordinary. Anything explainable. Then, three weeks after he came home, I woke up around 2:40 AM, heart pounding for no reason. The house was quiet. Too quiet. My dog wasn't in his usual spot next to my bed.



Then I heard it.



The soft sound of the kitchen drawer sliding open. Not yanked. Not rattled. Just... slid. Slow. Careful. Like someone was trying not to wake me.



Then came footsteps.



Not barefoot human steps. Not the clicking of claws.



It was something in between. Too light for a human. Too heavy for a dog. A strange, dragging rhythm like he wasn't quite sure which limb went first. I pulled the blanket over my mouth and listened as the footsteps moved down the hallway toward my bedroom. My mind kept telling me I was dreaming, but my body knew I wasn't.



A shadow shifted under the door.



The doorknob turned.



And he walked in.



My dog. But not like before. Not like anything that should move on four legs. He was standing, not fully upright, but rising, balancing, adjusting. And in his paw, gripped awkwardly, but firmly, was one of my kitchen knives. He padded toward me slowly. The blade glinted under the faint moonlight sneaking through the window. I could hear his breathing, but it wasn't panting. It was controlled. Deliberate. Matched to mine.



He stood beside my bed for a long time. Minutes that felt endless. His head tilted as if he were studying my face, copying the movement of my chest as I breathed—inhale, exhale, inhale.



The knife never wavered. I wanted to scream, but fear pinned me. I couldn't even close my eyes. I just watched him, and he watched me back, unblinking.



Then he leaned down. Very slowly.



His mouth opened, not to growl, not to bark, but to speak. And what came out wasn't a human voice, but it wasn't an animal sound either. It was something caught between the two, grinding through a throat that had never been meant for words.



"I won't bite this time."



He stood back up, tilted his head again, almost proud of himself, like he had finally mimicked something correctly. Then he turned and walked out of the room with the knife still in his hand.



I didn't sleep. I didn't move. I waited until morning, then locked myself in the bathroom and called every number on that program's brochure.



Disconnected. All of them.



That was three days ago.



He hasn't tried to hurt me. He hasn't touched the knife since. But now he follows me even closer. Copies the way I breathe. Copies the way I stand. Sometimes I catch him practicing in the hallway, adjusting his posture, rolling his shoulders, stretching his front legs in ways that look almost like arms.



I don't know what that program did. I don't know what they turned him into.



But I think...



I think they were teaching him to imitate.



And he's getting better every night.
