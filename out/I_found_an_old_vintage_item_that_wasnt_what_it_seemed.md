Moving into a new apartment always has its quirks, but mine had something extra. As I was unpacking, I found a small cardboard box tucked away in the back of a kitchen cabinet. Inside was an old voice recorder wrapped in duct tape. At first, I thought it might have been left behind by the previous tenant, but something about the meticulous way it was wrapped made me curious.

I peeled away the duct tape, revealing the recorder. It was an old model, one of those you'd see in the 90s, and still had a cassette inside. The label was faded, but I could make out a date: July 12, 1998. My curiosity piqued, I decided to play it.

The tape whirred to life with a click and a hiss of static. A man's voice, shaky and panicked, came through.

“If you’re listening to this, then please, heed my warning. Don’t unwrap the tape. Keep it sealed. I made a terrible mistake.”

There was a pause, followed by a deep sigh.

“It started a month ago. I found this same recorder in my apartment, wrapped in duct tape. I was curious, like you, and decided to see what was on it. At first, it was just noise, but then I heard it.”

The man’s voice trembled.

“A voice, whispering my name. It sounded like it was right behind me. I turned, but no one was there. I thought I was imagining things, but then it started happening more often. The whispers grew louder, more insistent.”

Another pause. A faint sound in the background, like a door creaking.

“I tried getting rid of the recorder, but it always came back. I’d find it in random places: my bedroom, the bathroom, even under my pillow. The whispers turned into screams. I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat. I was losing my mind.”

The man’s voice broke into sobs.

“I tried everything to make it stop. But nothing worked. Then I realized... the tape wasn’t the source. It was the duct tape. I started hearing voices in the tape. They told me to wrap the recorder and leave it for the next tenant. They said it was the only way to escape it."

There was a long silence. I thought the tape had ended, but then the voice returned, barely a whisper.

“Don’t unwrap the tape. I beg you. It’s too late for me, but maybe you can be saved.”

The tape clicked, ending in silence. I sat there, staring at the recorder, my heart pounding in my chest. It had to be a joke, right? Some elaborate prank. I lit my cigarette as I tried to relax thinking of my next move.

But then I heard it. A faint whisper, calling my name.

I spun around, but there was no one there. The whisper grew louder, more persistent. I grabbed the recorder, fumbling with the duct tape, and wrapped it back up as quickly as I could. The whispers faded, but they didn’t stop entirely.

I shoved the box back into the cabinet, praying it would be enough.

That night, I barely slept. Every creak of the apartment sounded like a whisper, every gust of wind a scream. My mind was trying to rarionalise it with paranoia from some sick persons idea of a prank. I knew I had to get rid of the recorder, but a part of me feared it would just come back.

The next day, I put the box in the dumpster outside, hoping that would be the end of it. But when I returned to my apartment, the box was back in the cabinet, the duct tape still intact.

I’m writing this as a warning to whoever finds this next. The recorder can’t be destroyed. The voices won’t stop. They want out. They need someone else.

If you find the box, please, don’t unwrap the tape.

And whatever you do, don’t listen to the whispers.
