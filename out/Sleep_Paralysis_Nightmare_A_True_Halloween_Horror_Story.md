I woke up in the dead of night, barely able to open my eyes. The silence was broken only by the faint hum of the refrigerator downstairs. My heart was pounding, but I couldn't remember why. A bad dream, perhaps? I tried to recall it, but my mind was a haze of shadows and fading images. Suddenly, there was a sound coming from just outside my bedroom door. It was faint, like someone sweeping the floor with a worn-out broom. There As the noise continued, growing slightly louder with each pass, my heart started pounding in my chest. I knew… I was home alone. Maybe it's just the house settling, I told myself, or the wind rustling through the trees outside. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t… A floorboard creaked in the hallway, and my stomach dropped. That specific creak only happened when someone stepped on that exact spot. I remembered countless times sneaking in late and wincing as it betrayed my attempts at silence.

I tried to sit up, to reach for my phone on the nightstand, but my body wouldn't respond. Panic surged through me as I realised I couldn't move a muscle. It was as if invisible chains held me down, binding me to the bed. I opened my mouth to scream, to call out for help, but no sound escaped. My voice was trapped somewhere deep inside, smothered by an unseen force.
The door handle rattled ever so slightly, and then, with an agonising slowness, it began to turn. The door creaked open, inch by inch, the hinges protesting with a drawn-out whine. My eyes were locked on the widening gap, dread pooling in the pit of my stomach.

A shadowy figure stood in the doorway, just a mass of darkness with no distinguishable features. Its form was shrouded in darkness, edges blurred as if it were made of smoke. As it entered the room, the air grew colder, and a heavy weight pressed down on my chest

I could feel the atmosphere change—the once familiar room now felt alien and threatening. The faint glow of the moon through the curtains seemed to dim, swallowed by the darkness.

The figure moved closer, and with every slow step, my heartbeat thundered louder in my ears. I could do nothing but watch, my eyes wide with terror. It stopped at the foot of my bed, its head tilting slightly as if observing me. Though I couldn't see any eyes, I felt its gaze piercing straight through me.

I could feel the weight of its presence pressing down on me, a heavy, suffocating force. The room seemed to darken with each passing second, like the darkness was alive, slowly swallowing me whole. It was as if the shadows were wrapping around my chest, making it harder to breathe.
The figure leaned into me. I wanted so desperately to shut my eyes—but I couldn’t. I was forced to stare at this dark, looming presence, mere inches away.
And then… it spoke.

The voice wasn’t like anything I had ever heard. It wasn’t human. It was deep, and haunting, as if coming from a place not meant for the living. I couldn’t understand a single word—it was like the language of shadows, vibrating through my chest and rattling my bones. The sound sent shivers down my spine, a cold that penetrated right to my core. I felt like I was suffocating under the weight of the words I couldn’t comprehend. I again tried to scream but no sound came out of me.

And then just as quickly as the figure came… it disappeared. I lay there, gasping for air, my chest raised as I tried to catch my breath. I could again move my own limbs. The room seemed brighter again. I stared at the door, half-expecting it to still be open… but it was closed. Like it always had been.

Was it a nightmare? It felt too real, too vivid to be a mere dream. I swung my legs over the side of the bed, my bare feet touching the cold floor. Summoning all my courage, I stood up and made my way to the door. My hand hesitated on the doorknob, fearful of what I might find on the other side.
Taking a deep breath, I turned the knob and pulled the door open. The hallway stretched out before me, dimly lit by the nightlight plugged in at the far end. I stepped out, the floorboards creaking softly under my weight.
I checked each room meticulously—the guest room, the bathroom, the small office. Everything was in its place, no signs of an intruder. The front door was locked, deadbolt secure. The windows were closed, latches fastened tight.
Returning to my bedroom, I sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing my temples. My mind raced to rationalize the experience. Sleep paralysis—that had to be it. I'd read about it before: the sensation of being awake but unable to move, often accompanied by hallucinations. It was a plausible explanation, but it didn't let the lingering fear go away. But one thing was certain: it felt real. Too real…

For those of you who have experienced sleep paralysis, you know exactly what I’m talking about. It’s not just a nightmare. It’s something else entirely. An invasion of your mind and body where you’re caught between sleep and waking. You can see and hear things, but you can’t move or scream. You’re completely at the mercy of whatever your mind—or perhaps something beyond—wants to show you.

Experts say that sleep paralysis is just a trick of the mind, a glitch when your brain wakes up before your body does, leaving you stuck in a half-dream state. They say that’s all it is. But when you’re lying there, unable to move, and you feel a presence in the room, hear it whispering in a language you don’t know, and see a shadow figure looming over you… it’s hard to believe it’s just a glitch.

Has this ever happened to you?
