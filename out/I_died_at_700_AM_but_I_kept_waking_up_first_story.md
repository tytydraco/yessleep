The loud, annoying alarm blared right at 7:00 AM sharp. As I jolted upright, stretched, and gasped for air, I slowly opened my eyes.

  


 My room looked different, but nothing truly was.. Maybe it was the silence, the dark, the way the morning didn't seem like a *morning*, more of a dusk, or something in between? Almost as if the day hadn’t been born yet. 



As I swung my legs off the bed to begin my morning strong, I felt lightheaded but brushed it off. After all, I did drink quite a lot last night. I headed to the bathroom, and everything was normal. My tooth in its cup, my towel tossed on the floor, the Sharpie stain on the door from when I was a kid, I convinced myself I was just hung over.



 When I wiped my mouth from the dripping combination of toothpaste, water, and saliva, I headed to my room, and my eyes landed on the clock on my bedside table.

  


 It read “*7:00 AM.” I furrowed my eyebrows in confusion.* Sure, I was quick, but not **that** quick. When I got dressed, brushed my teeth, and returned to my room, it was still *7:00 AM.*  

  


Surely it must have been an error, I blinked and rubbed my eyes like some dumbass in a shitty horror movie, but to no avail. 



Last night I remember getting home around 3 AM, barely, driving around, lost for a bit in a rough storm wasn't the easiest, but I did make it home, right? I sat down on my messy bed, staring at the glitched clock. The power must have gone out last night, and it reset it. I laughed, realizing I had been paranoid for no reason about something that was so painfully obvious.



I headed downstairs, hoping to find breakfast made, but as I reached the last step, the house was eerily quiet, as usual. Thats the only bad thing about living in a big house with parents who couldn’t give less of a shit about you.



 I yawned once again and headed to the kitchen, where I had a clear view of the waterfall in the backyard. I stood on my toes in front of the medicine cabinet, attempting to reach the hangover relief Alka-Seltzer box that had become my safe-haven over the summer so far.  But when I finally reached it, I must've tossed it back even further to the point of not being able to reach it. I groaned in frustration, but it's not like that would've helped my case.



 As I walked over to the fridge, hoping to find some food, I felt a lick on my leg. I turned around, and it was my dog, *Tinker.* I smiled at her and continued to rummage through the fridge, but she started barking, annoyed, with a heavy migraine, it was already bad enough, so I yelled at her out of frustration, “Shut up!”. But something was off, the *atmosphere*… I could feel eyes on me.



 Tinker's barks started becoming more aggressive, too aggressive for a tiny chihuahua. I flipped on the light switch to provide more light than whatever had been coming in through the large windows, still something between dusk and morning, so nothing.



 When I turned them on, she stopped. She did this often, so I didn't think anything of it, but as I looked at her, I realized she was barking at me. Not past me, not behind me, but *directly* at me. I swallowed hard and tried to pick her up, but she quickly backed away, as if I were a stranger or something. Her long, uncut nails clacked against the glazed epoxy floors, quickly tapping, anxiously. I threw a turkey slice of ham to her, and she sniffed it but just sat, staring at me. 



Frustrated, I leaned against the counter, eating some cheese and ham. And my vision started to blur at the edges. I stared into the oven's glossy reflection, expecting to see a messy, hungover version of me, but I saw nothing.



My vision was lost for a few seconds, but as I blindly guided myself to the sink to splash my face with cold water, it returned. Now being able to see my reflection, I was horrified, not in a horrible way but in disgust, my acne-ridden face, messy, tangled hair, and remnants of last night's makeup and hickeys everywhere.

  
  
  


 I buried my face into my hands and sobbed. I didn’t want to admit it, but I was barely holding myself together. The weight of everything,  the fighting at home with my parents, which was rare because I hardly ever saw them. The silence in the hallways, that really wasn't only in the halls but everywhere.  The way my parents barely noticed I existed anymore was crushing me. Alcohol was my temporary comfort, only for a while. Then it would be reality again.

  
I leaned back onto the counter, almost slipping. Was I still drunk? Staring at the kitchen floor, I then turned to the window, the sky still the way that it had been since I had woken up that day, bruised and pale. I grabbed my phone off the counter, feeling sick and empty. Expecting to see a good morning text from my boyfriend, but  anxiety rushed over me when the time read “*7:00 AM”* 



“*What the fuck?*” I said out loud, No texts, missed calls, social media notifications. *Nothing.* I called my mom to see if she knew anything about the power potentially going out last night, but on the first ring, I got a text.



*“Can’t talk right now, baby, I'm busy.”*



I groaned in frustration, slamming my phone onto the cold granite counter, resulting in it slightly cracking. I winced, knowing I had just gotten it, a new one at that. Well, it had been my parents' “apology” gift for never being home. 



After a while of blankly staring at the cold, dirty kitchen floor, I grabbed my keys, slipped on my shoes, and grabbed my phone. In an instant, I ran down to my car, hastily opening the door and slowly slipping into the freezing leather seats. My legs were shaking as I turned on the car, waiting for it to warm up, and I connected my car to the Bluetooth. Once I selected a decent enough playlist, I quickly reversed out of the carport, driving through the dense farmlands that were near my house. After about 20 minutes, I got on the main highway. I didn’t know where I was going, but I figured I’d make it worth my while. I switched playlists to something more upbeat and cranked the music up as much as it would go. The roads were mostly empty, except for a few trailers here and there.



Nodding in and out of faint sleep, I realized I needed something to keep me busy. I reached into my glovebox looking for the vape I had hidden there, not that there was a need to hide it, my parents would freak, but would they seriously have time to go rummaging through their loser daughter's car? No. 



Finally, I found it and started hitting it. I was going 100 in a 75, heavy fog, but I didn't have a single care. Since the road was mostly empty, i was fucking around, switching lanes for fun, my bright LED headlights barely cutting through the fog.



 As I saw bright headlights illuminating my face, I knew i was fucked. I must’ve crossed the median,  bracing for impact, I looked at the clock, “*7:00 AM”.* 



A jolt of panic began to surge through me, almost as if waking me up from the brain fog I’d been going through all morning. But it was far too late.

  


The sound of tires screeching, glass shattering, and the airbag throwing me back.

Then — Silence 

  


At first, there was nothing, no screams, no blood-curdling pain, no ringing. Just an empty void swallowing me whole.

  
  


Then – a soft whisper, barely audible.

*“You shouldn’t have come back.”*



I froze, my breath hitched.



The voice is now a tad bit louder

*“You can't escape it, you never could.”*



A pile of bodies, like a mountain, more like. Some magled, burned, jaws twisted, glass in their eyes. Then it hit me, a god-awful stench. Decomposition beyond its limits. I felt like throwing up, but I couldn’t.



Then, they all turned to look at me, speaking in some sort of Latin or tongues. I was scared to my core, but I couldn't do anything; I was stuck. 



I scrambled to get up, slipping in the thick, warm blood pooling beneath me. My hands sank into the flesh of my own corpse like mud. The smell hit me then HARD. Not just blood. Not just rot. But *something sour and sweet*, like burnt sugar and decay.

  


My phone buzzed in my pocket and I answered it without thinking. But there was no voice on the line. Just a low, wet *breathing.* And beneath it… **chewing.** “Hello?” I whispered. my voice—*my exact voice*—answered: **“Look behind you.”** 

  
I turned and saw myself. But not really. My face was caved in from the crash. Skin peeled back. One eyeball dangling, swinging like a pendulum. My arms dragged along the floor like they were broken in several places. Blood poured from my mouth like drool.  But I smiled. A horrible, wide, splitting smile.

And then— I started laughing.

Not a normal laugh.

Something *high-pitched*, static-filled, echoing like it came from a broken television set.

Then – Silence. For a bit, it was just a black void but then everything reappeared, the smell worsening. 



“*You never left the crash, Julisa.”*



*One of the mangled corpses pulled me down, bugs begining to crawl on me* 

*“This is where you stay. You made this. You fed it. And now, it feeds on you.”*

*The darkness opened up, only to open my eyes to my alarm clock.*



*“7:00 AM.”*



*It looped, continuously. Was this hell? It must be.*



Awakening, driving, crashing, the bodies, the ***smell****,* the whispers, and the pain. All just to repeat it. And that would be my eternity



*“7:00 AM.”*



*Every. Single. Time.*



I screamed until my voice tore out of my throat, corpses grabbing parts of my body, harming me until I mirrored their appearances. I was screaming. Still screaming..
