The camera begins recording. The dim light illuminates a man with a weary face, his eyes reflecting years of suffering and fear. His hands tremble slightly as he adjusts the microphone in front of him. The image is slightly blurry, as if the quality was deliberately reduced, to make it harder to trace. He is in a small, messy room, with papers and maps scattered across the floor. There are no windows. Just a closed door. The whispers of the news that the world hasn’t heard yet prepare to go public. He settles in, takes a breath, and begins to speak. His voice is deep but firm.

"Now you’re going to know... why everything is real. It’s not some conspiracy theory. I know, because I am a witness to what happened. I was one of the people who was part of the investigation. I was one of the people who tried to inform the world about what was being hidden. They silenced us, they manipulated us, they erased us. They made us disappear. And now, now that I have nothing left but my life to reveal the truth, I will do it. This message, this video, this recording you will see on all platforms... YouTube, Spotify, Reddit, 4Chan... I know it will spread. Most won’t believe it at first, but some will, and those are the ones who will spread it. And to those I ask: spread it. This is not just a story, it’s our story."

He pauses, his eyes wavering between the camera and something in the distance, as if reliving a scene that marked him forever.

"What I’m going to tell you today is the truth they’ve kept from us all along. And it’s not something we can keep ignoring. The ancient civilizations... all of them knew about this. The Egyptians, the Sumerians, the Mayans, the Native Americans, all of them, in some way, left clues. Hieroglyphs, cave paintings, myths, legends... they are more than stories; they are records. Records of a contact we’ve ignored for millennia. And it wasn’t a contact from beings that came from ‘another planet,’ like they’ve told us... No, no. These beings have always been here, on this very planet, but in a place we never bothered to learn about: the depths of the ocean."

The man shifts in his chair, the tension on his face becoming more palpable. His voice hardens.

"Yes, you heard that right. We’ve learned more about outer space than about the depths of our own world. Why do you think it’s easier for governments, for scientists, to send missions to Mars than to explore the deepest waters of our oceans? Why this obsession with the stars and extraterrestrial life, when what’s really under our noses — or rather, under the water — has always been far more important?"

He sighs, then leans forward, as if speaking in secret to someone.

"And now, I’m going to tell you what really happened. The story we were never allowed to know. Humanity is not what they told us. We are not the original and dominant species of this planet. Our species, Homo sapiens, is actually just a subtribe of something much older. We are a modified version, a sub-evolution. They, the ones who came from the depths, have been here for over 100,000 years. And not only have they been here... they, the ones who stayed in the ocean, in their kingdom, realized something. Something that humans, over the centuries, forgot: we, humans, come from them. They created us."

The man slams his hand lightly on the table, as if the emotion is overwhelming him.

"Yes, don’t be scared. What they told us about evolution? It’s just part of the truth. Humans evolved, but only part of us did. Those beings who came to the surface, to the land, formed what we now know as humanity, but they weren’t the only ones. The ones who stayed in the depths... they continued to exist, watching us. All this time, they never interfered in our evolution. But let’s not be mistaken, they always... were... watching."

The man pauses for a moment and looks down, as if he had lost the thread of his own narrative. Then, he collects himself. The camera keeps recording. The man, visibly exhausted but with a determined look, adjusts his glasses as he begins to speak. His voice is deeper, more meticulous, as if he wants every word to be clearly understood. He pauses before continuing, as if about to reveal something crucial. His gaze grows more intense.

"What do I mean by saying we are a 'subtribe' of these beings? I’m a biologist. And before I continue, I want you to understand a basic concept of biology that, although simple, has deep implications for understanding what we're living through. A 'subtribe' is not just a derived species. It's something more complex. It’s an evolutionary line that belongs to a larger group but has diverged, following its own path while still sharing the same genetic root.

"In biological terms, a tribe is a group of species that share a common ancestor. Within that tribe, subtribes can emerge: populations that, although related, have evolved differently, separated by time, space, or environmental factors. The concept is primarily used in taxonomy to explain how different species within a family relate to each other, but… what would happen if I told you that our 'tribe', Homo sapiens, is not the original species of Earth? What if I told you that our species is a subtribe within a much older and much more complex branch?"

The man pauses, moves closer to the camera, and points with his index finger to his own chest.

"We, as Homo sapiens, don’t just descend from these beings. We are not just part of their lineage… we are a subtribe that emerged from a common ancestor with them. The first Homo sapiens that came to the surface were not the primordial species. We… we were a modified version of something much larger. Something that has been here long before humanity even had a name."

He adjusts his glasses again, taking a moment to think, searching for the best way to explain what he just said. His voice softens as the explanation progresses.

"And what does this exactly mean? Let’s imagine that the beings who stayed in the ocean, our ancestors, began as a very advanced civilization, perhaps as advanced as ours, but for some reason… they separated. Instead of following an evolutionary line like ours, they chose to remain there, in their own domain, beneath the waters. And we… we, the humans on land, are not the originals. We are… a version altered by events that happened centuries ago, eons ago."

His expression turns serious, as if recalling something that should never have happened.

"But these events didn’t happen by chance. Thousands of years ago, the beings that came to the surface, who joined what we now know as humanity, were part of a larger plan. A plan that involved genetic manipulation, which led them to form a new subtribe, a different version of what we truly are. Something, some catastrophic event, or perhaps a conscious decision, made these beings take a different path from their brothers who stayed in the ocean."

The man falls silent for a moment, as if reconsidering the words he just spoke, then continues more clearly.

"And this is where our story twists. These beings, who are not 'extraterrestrials' as we’ve been told, have always been here. They’ve been part of this planet for longer than any other form of human life. They, the ones who stayed in the depths, are the true 'originals' of Earth. We, we simply took part of their legacy and ventured to the surface. But the contact never broke. It was never completely forgotten."

The camera captures the sweat dripping from his forehead, his fingers nervously drumming on the table, as he continues explaining.

"And this is what they are showing us now. The Blue Beam Project... the attempt to create a fake extraterrestrial invasion, the attempt to manipulate us, all of this has a purpose. They are setting the stage for the truth, a truth we can no longer deny. Those who came before us, who stayed under the water, have been waiting. Waiting for humanity, so lost in its beliefs of grandeur and superiority, to finally realize what we've done."

The biologist takes a deep breath, his gaze intensifies.

"Why do you think we’ve learned more about space than the depths of our planet? Why is it easier for nations and scientists to design technology to travel to Mars than to explore the darkest corners of our oceans? The answer is simple. Because they know something we haven't wanted to see. At the bottom of the ocean… we’re not safe. We never were."

His eyes now seem full of regret, as if he has come to the brink of a bitter conclusion.

"We’ve acted like a plague. Like an invasive species. Like a troublesome subtribe that has destroyed everything it’s touched. The oceans, ecosystems, biodiversity… everything has been devastated by our greed, by our belief that we are the 'owners' of this planet. And now… now the ones who stayed in the ocean, the ones who’ve been waiting… have decided they can no longer allow us to continue with our destruction."

The man lets out a heavy sigh, and his tone turns grim.

"And that’s why this revelation, this video… is the final warning. It’s not about invasion. It’s about justice. It’s about survival. They are prepared to intervene when the time comes, and that time is near."

His face hardens again.

"Why do you think ancient civilizations always spoke of beings that came from the sea, or the sky, or both? Why are the mythologies, legends, and stories from indigenous peoples around the world filled with creatures that are half human, half fish, or gods that descended from the sky and the waters? They were here, with us, long before humanity existed as we know it. And what they have hidden from us is that we were never the first. We are... children of the oceans, in more than one sense."

"Over time, we forgot about the sea, the water, our roots. We became obsessed with the sky, with what lies beyond the atmosphere. And not because it was easier to get there... but because they knew we were safer out there. In space, away from them."

Pause. His voice becomes lower, more serious.

"The Blue Beam Project... what happened in 2024, at the conference, was their response. They knew the time had come. They knew we could no longer keep living the way we did. The evidence was ready, the warning signs had already been sent. And many of us... many of us witnessed the communication attempts they made, through the networks, through images, through fake extraterrestrial life signals. But the message they left us was clear. It's not just that they know us, it's not that they come to invade us, no. It's much worse. They are watching us, waiting. And when the right moment comes... they will make us disappear."

The man takes a long pause, his eyes reflecting a mixture of fear and resignation.

"We are the plague in their world. They, the ones who stayed in the ocean, are prepared. They knew everything. And we, so obsessed with space, don't realize that the real danger... the real challenge to our existence... is beneath the waters, beneath our shores, where the depths of the ocean hold what we have forgotten. And they... the ones who came before... are already waiting. And we... we are not welcome."

The man adjusts his glasses once more, his face tense but determined. In the camera, it's clear he's about to take one more step, a step that will change everything the audience thought they knew about the world. His words grow firmer.

"Now that I've told you all this, I know some of you will be thinking: 'This is crazy. It can't be true.' And believe me, I understand. But I'm not lying to you. I'm giving you the truth. If you have any doubts about what I've said, if you think this is all just fantasy, I ask you not to believe me just because I'm saying it. Don't believe me because of the desperation you might hear in my voice. Don't believe me just because you see me on this camera. No! Look for the information yourselves."

He pauses and leans in closer to the camera, with an urgent gesture, as if what he's about to say is the key to making the truth more accessible.

"I am a real person. My track record is documented. My work, my research, my scientific publications... it's all there, accessible to anyone with internet access. If you have doubts about my credibility, if you don't believe someone like me could be telling the truth, look me up. I'm not a hidden figure. My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (pip) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (pip), and if you search for my name online, on YouTube, Google, social media like Twitter or Reddit, you'll see that everything I say is not just a conspiracy theory. You'll find my career, my studies, my research... they didn’t take the time to erase anything, of course, they thought: 'Who’s going to believe a crazy, failed scientist? He’ll just be part of the “Conspiranoics” line.'"

The biologist steps back from the camera as if letting his words sink in with the listeners. His tone becomes softer, but no less serious.

"Look, verify, don’t just take what the media shows you. In all those official reports, in all those press conferences, everything has been manipulated. They told us it's all a 'theory.' They told us it's 'impossible.' But, if you dig deeper, if you open your minds, if you really analyze history... you’ll realize that I’m not the only one talking about this. I’m not the only one who has been warning."

The camera focuses on his face, the tension in his eyes is clear, as if he is pleading for people to believe him, for them not to miss the opportunity to understand the truth.

"What I've just told you, what's in this video, is only the beginning. The 'Blue Beam Project', the extraterrestrials... they're not inventions. Everything you think you know about human history, about what we believe we are, is about to be dismantled. But for that, you have to look beyond. Don’t just settle for the official version, don’t just take what the governments, the media, the controlled networks tell you. Go out and seek, and you will see that everything I’m saying has backing."

The man gives one last intense look toward the camera.

"So go ahead. Look up about me. Look up \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (pip) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (pip) and see what you find. My work is recorded, my research is not hidden. If you really want to know the truth, it’s at your fingertips. I'm not lying, and you shouldn’t keep ignoring what is happening at the bottom of the ocean, and what this means for all of us."

The biologist takes a deep breath, his face now reflecting unwavering determination. After everything he's been through, what he's had to hide and endure, he's finally ready to release the truth to the world.

"This is the last step... the final step."

He sits down at his computer, his hands trembling slightly as he navigates through the platforms. YouTube, Reddit, X, Spotify, Facebook, 4Chan... his video is being uploaded to each of those networks. He uploads it fearlessly, without any doubt. In his mind, the same phrase repeats over and over: 'It’s time for everyone to know.' The man watches the screen as the loading process advances. Every second that passes feels like an eternity, but he knows that what is about to happen will change the fate of humanity.

Finally, the video is published. The title appears on the screen of each platform: "The Truth About the Blue Beam Project: What They Don't Want You to Know." Within seconds, the screen fills with the first 'likes,' 'comments,' and 'shares.' Reactions start to pour in. People are starting to watch.

However, the man doesn’t have much time. A loud knock on the door. His heart beats heavily. He knows that this moment has come, and there’s no turning back. No matter how hard they try, the truth is already out. No one will be able to silence it. But his mind is restless, the powers that have manipulated history have been hunting him for days. Before he can stand up, the door is smashed open with a loud crash. A group of men in dark suits enters the room. Special forces, intelligence agents, surround him. They don’t need to say anything. Just by looking at them, he knows what’s coming.

They grab him by the arms with force, lift him up, and drag him outside. The lights in the room flicker, and a sense of despair floods him. He resists for a moment, but he knows he can’t win. His thoughts keep spinning: 'It doesn’t matter anymore. The truth is out.' As they drag him out of the house, the man takes one last look at his computer screen. The post is there, online, and already has thousands of views. Hundreds of comments from people who, like him, are starting to wake up. The truth is being revealed.

A quick glance at one of the agents' phones confirms what he already knows: the numbers are still rising. Every second that passes, the video gets more clicks, more 'likes,' more shares. The comments are filled with disbelief, questions, and people who finally understand what has been hidden for so long. No one will be able to stop the tide that has just begun. The man is pushed into a windowless vehicle, while his mind keeps working, repeating the same phrase: 'They can’t silence us anymore.'
