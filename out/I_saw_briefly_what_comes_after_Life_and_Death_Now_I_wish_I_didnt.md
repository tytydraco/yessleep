I didn't mean to see this, the reality beyond life and death. But, as I awoke after an anaphylaxis episode that should have killed me, I remembered I was sent back after being told about the true nature of our world by a voice I can only call God. Everything is such a mess in my head. I need to put this down in writing. 

We are not alone. There are other lifeforms in this universe besides the ones we are aware of, and we used to call them angels and demons. Now we call them aliens, and the recent news about official hearings about UFOs means that our world leaders are also aware of the truth. It will be important later. 

-Second, our corner of the world as we know it, is pretty much a small lit candle In the middle of darkness, a small beacon of light and order against the night and the chaos of every eldritch horror being out there. There used to be more places like this one, but the darkness is all consuming, like the stars that die, collapse onto themselves and turn into black holes, we are also going to be consumed by our own nature. There is a thin layer, called the firmament, which separates us from the nothing. God, an entity, is in charge of keeping this in place and keep our reality from collapsing onto itself. That's God's basic function.

-Heaven and Hell, as we know it, doesn't exist. And I say it, because they are not 2 places. It's one. But our perception of this place varies depending on our prior life and actions, of what we carry with our karma, our pain and suffering. It's like life in a family with 2 parents and 3 children. The 3 children will live in the same house at the same time raised by the same couple, but each child will have a drastically different childhood. As the oldest will live a life full of responsibility over it's siblings and too high of expectations, so will the middle will live a life that is full of struggle to be recognised in a competition over resources and the third will live a childhood where everything is far away from it's own bubble of reality. This place operates in the exact same way, only instead of parents screwing us over, it's our own actions and karma we have acquired over our lifetimes. Our actions have consequences and there is justice, although a twisted raw, brutal one. Those who lived a life full of pain and suffering will be treated in the same way they treated their own lives and those who spent their lives killing, torturing and causing pain will see their victims as their own personal torturers. There is a reason why all religions have as a general rule to be kind to others as you would be kind to yourself. The alternative is much worse. 

- Our physical reality is not the only one out there. Rather, our world consists of several dimensions which act as a whole and interact with what we know as the physical world. Scientist try to explain this through quantum science, religion through the Heaven and Hell parallelism, Valhala, Elysium, Underworld, the Purgatory, the Astral, the world of Ideas. Nobody knows exactly what and how many dimensions exist out there, although what we do know, is that these realities exist on layers, layers on top of each other, like the pages of a book, only that unlike a single page which can only touch 2 other pages next to each other, these layers can and do interact with each other. Our world leaders are also aware of this fact, and it's closely connected with the recent UFO hearings. 

-Lastly. What we do know as angels, demons, aliens, gods, egregores, parasites and any other otherworldly entities are simply natives of these dimensions, who can sometimes interact with our physical reality, just as we can sometimes interact with their realities as well, especially after death. Science and technology are only just another way we can interact with some of these dimensions. 

During my time under, I was given a bird's eye view to the inner workings of our world and I saw how mathematics are basically just another expression of this reality. I also truly understood, for the first time even, that nothing matters, and at the same time, every little thing does. We are all the universe experiencing itself, a giant fever dream, and the chaos outside of the firmament is cancer we are fighting against by our own existence. It's pure chaos. No rules, no life, no death, no order or light, only chaos. Even being the strongest of the jungle means nothing there, because the chaos equivalent of an ant will kill you, just because. 

God wanted pretty much a corner of the world to have order, which is why we exist. This being is coming from Chaos itself, it has no age for it is not mortal, and no beginning and end, for it is aeternal in a way only chaos can be. And yet, it's because of that same nature of God, that can make order and make this whole world. We are called as being made by God's image, because we can, in fact interact with order and chaos. We can create our own world, our own dimensions, our very own heaven and hell. We are the judges and judged. We are the free and the slaves, the old and young the good and bad. We are the Chaos putting ourselves into Order. And our existence is a consequence of God's existence. We exist to rule and be ruled. We exist because we want to exist, we give meaning because we want to have meaning. And yet, we are still evil. We steal, torture and kill others just because we want to, the excuse being power and money. We don't deserve a happy ending just because we exist, we have to fight for it. Our entitlement, our blindness and greed, our lazynes and lust. We lose everyday against our faults. And this is reflected to the afterlife. We all end up each other's personal hell. 

So, why am I telling you this? Why go through all this effort to get this post out there, only for it to not be taken seriously?

It's because we are delectable food for the chaos. We are ripe for consumption from whatever lurks out there. And we know this, deep down. Entropy scares us, because it reminds us that we will go back to where we came from, like everything that goes up, must go down. And we are way too far up for our downfall to be anything merciful. Our efforts to communicate with the other dimensions, it's just another foolish plan of the humanity to escape the inevitable. It will fail. And we will suffer needlessly because of it. 

I can speak no more. I can write neither read what I have written. I need to drink myself into stupor, so I won't remember what I've written and maybe also escape the price paid for revealing this gnosis. Or maybe my stupor will be the payment. All I know is that I know nothing and ignorance is truly a bliss. 

God help us all. We do not deserve peace.
