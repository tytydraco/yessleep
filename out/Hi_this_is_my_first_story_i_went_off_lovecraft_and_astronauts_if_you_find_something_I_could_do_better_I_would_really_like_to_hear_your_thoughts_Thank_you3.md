ECLIPSE OF THE INFINITE – ISS MISSION LOGS 2032

Mission Overview:
The ISS is tasked with monitoring anomalous auroral activity in the northern hemisphere. Initial readings suggest a previously unknown cosmic phenomenon. Within days, crew members report temporal anomalies, sightings of semi-corporeal entities, and interaction with incomprehensible godlike beings. Reality itself begins to fracture.

⸻

Phase One: Detection (Days 1–4)

Commander Vega – Day 1 (Orbit 14,592)

Initial anomaly detected over northern hemisphere. Electromagnetic pulses recorded at unknown frequencies, outside normal solar activity. Onboard chronometers deviating ±4.7s per minute. No immediate danger, crew stable. Crew logs will be maintained continuously.

Scientist Li – Day 2 (Orbit 14,596)

Shadows seen in peripheral vision. Attempts at recording yield static distortion. Crew reports whispering from the walls. Sounds emotional, indecipherable. Personal stress levels rising. Notes: recommend limited observation to avoid psychological degradation.

Engineer Kuro – Day 3 (Orbit 14,602)

Objects duplicated or displaced. Coffee mug appears on bench, then again floating in zero-G seconds later. Hypothesis: localized temporal flux. Crew instructed to report any temporal inconsistencies.

Commander Vega – Day 4 (Orbit 14,610)

First visual contact with entities. Semi-corporeal, geometrically impossible. Appear attracted to fear and attention. Crew experiencing hallucinations: past trauma, future events, impossible internal geometries. Log: avoid direct observation when possible.

⸻

Phase Two: Initial Contact (Days 5–10)

Scientist Li – Day 5 (Orbit 14,615)

Godlike forms observed outside viewport. Massive, incomprehensible. Time perception disrupted—minutes feel like hours. Instruments unreliable. Crew instructed to focus on immediate tasks.

Engineer Kuro – Day 6 (Orbit 14,620)

Temporal loops confirmed. Conversations, EVA prep repeat with minor differences. Communications with Earth deliver incoherent, seemingly “future” messages. Crew stress critical.

Commander Vega – Day 7 (Orbit 14,625)

ISS interior appears non-Euclidean. Corridors fold and stretch; lights flicker irregularly. Crew begins psychological fracturing. Some isolate voluntarily; others speak incoherently.

Scientist Li – Day 8 (Orbit 14,632)

Alternate timelines begin manifesting. Crew interacts with duplicates. Entities’ interaction intensifies: temperature shifts, physical displacement, auditory distortion. Psychological impact severe.

Engineer Kuro – Day 9 (Orbit 14,640)

Godlike beings now subtly affecting station. Temporal eddies observed near viewport; moments repeat infinitely. Recording devices fail—digital media overwritten spontaneously.

Commander Vega – Day 10 (Orbit 14,648)

Survivors (n=2) report perceiving all time simultaneously. ISS visually intact. Anomaly no longer detectable externally. Do not attempt EVA. Crew cognitively unstable.

⸻

Phase Three: Deepening Horror (Days 11–21)

Day 11 – Engineer Kuro Personal Log

Time is slippery. I observed myself working on experiments, then reappearing across the station corridor, confused. Shadows of entities flicker across the walls, moving faster than possible. Aurora outside seems alive, pulsating in rhythm with the whispers.

Day 12 – Scientist Li

EVA report: Earth appears as a translucent sphere. Auroras spiral in unnatural patterns. I glimpsed a massive shadow stretching across continents—something colossal, yet beyond comprehension. My mind strains to retain continuity.

Day 13 – Commander Vega

Crew fractures psychologically. One member attempts to merge with an entity through the viewport—vanishes for thirty minutes, returns incoherent. Temporal dissonance increasing. Personal log: hold myself together; record all anomalies.

Day 14–16 – Multiple Crew Logs

Corridors lengthen impossibly, fold in on themselves. Lights flicker in impossible patterns. Coffee mug reappears in multiple locations simultaneously. Notes and sketches of entities—fractal, semi-transparent, constantly shifting.

Day 17 – Scientist Li

Voices in multiple languages, alien yet familiar. Instructing, coaxing, observing. Some crew members whisper answers back. The anomaly seems sentient, communicating directly with consciousness.

Day 18–20 – EVA Observations

Godlike beings observed outside station: incomprehensible scale, impossible geometry. Auroras pulse as if signaling them. Instruments cannot measure distance or size. Time perception distorted—minutes feel like centuries.

Day 21 – Commander Vega

Crew partially disconnected from linear time. Hallucinations overlap reality. Entities now tangible, manipulating zero-G objects, touching instruments. Logs no longer reliable. Reality continues fracturing.

⸻

Phase Four: Temporal Collapse (Days 22–33)

Day 22–24 – Engineer Kuro Logs

Temporal loops dominate. Conversations and actions repeat endlessly with small variations. Attempting to differentiate “current” moment from looped moment impossible. Coffee mug appears, vanishes, then reappears as if mocking sanity.

Day 25 – Scientist Li

Entire EVA section frozen in one timeline, while elsewhere ISS continues operations. Aurora writhes like a living entity. Crew communicates with “versions” of themselves from other loops. Confusion total.

Day 26–28 – Commander Vega

Godlike beings now omnipresent. Station becomes their plaything. Crew interacts with entities physically—walls phase through bodies, corridors twist. Sense of time utterly shattered.

Day 29 – Multiple Logs

Crew members vanish and return with no memory of absence. Temporal loops overlay, creating fractal sequences. Recording devices fail. Aurora outside mirrors internal chaos. Notes: “We exist everywhere, nowhere.”

Day 30–33 – Final Transmission

All logs fragmented, overlapping, nonsensical.
Commander Vega: “We are untethered from time. Earth continues unaware. Do not attempt communication. The infinite watches, and it remembers us.”
ISS visually intact, anomaly invisible, yet survivors exist partially outside linear time. End log.
