Three years ago I ruined my life, I ruined my wife’s life and I ruined my son’s life. He was only eight, I always walked him to the bus, he would even occasionally hold my hand. My wife couldn’t walk him, she was out of the house before five for her bakery job and it meant I was always left to look after young Leroy.

  The bus was always a fun time for the small boy, it was back roads all the way up to his school and my work so it was usually just us and Gary. Gary was an older man who would travel with his grandson. I remember Gary because he always wore a nice black suit, black shirt underneath and oddly a black tie on top. He was quite old, mid seventies minimum. The kid with him is harder to picture, whenever I envision a child from memory Leroy always would creep into their spot, like every single young child in my life was a carbon copy of my son. The odd thing about Gary’s grandson was how often he would be asleep, only on occasion would he be open eyed, staring at the back of the seat in front of him.

  Gary was lovely to talk to, so wise and thoughtful. He spoke like a poet or a man out of time, almost like a ghost in an old folktale. Leroy would be enthralled by Gary’s tales, what he did in his younger years. Even though he would often misunderstand words or phrases, Leroy would love to listen.

  One morning, I slept through my alarm or maybe I dismissed it in a sleepy haze or maybe I forgot to set an alarm. When I naturally blinked myself awake, the house was cold and silent. The sun had already risen and I had slept past my shift start. I launched myself out of bed calling for my son through the freezing walls and waiting for an annoyed grumble or a pissed off, “What?” But nothing came. I thundered down the hallway and swung his door open.

  “Come on little man, Daddy screwed up.” I said as I looked in, but there was no sign of the boy, his bed was made and his backpack was gone. I ran into the kitchen and he wasn’t there either, instead there was a note. It was written in his perfectly awful chicken scratch, a rock placed on top to weigh it down.



*“Dear Dad. You were snoreing so I packed my bag and am walking to the bus NOW. I love you!”*



Beneath the writing was a drawing of the clock on the wall, if it were to be read correctly he left around 7:30, the usual time he and I would leave. I ran my fingers through my hair and muttered, “Fuck, fuck, fuck.” Under my breath.

  Still in my underwear I ran to the front door and it was wide open for the world to see, Leroy was always too short to pull the door shut by the handle and so often tried yanking it shut by the side and it would fail to latch fully. I stared out into the world that swallowed my boy and started to cry, in my heart I hoped and begged the universe that he would be safe but there was something ruthlessly tugging at my guts telling me he was gone, utterly vanished into nothingness. 

  I pulled the door shut and it clicked, I hustled back to my room and called his school. He wasn’t there. I threw on some pants and pulled an old stained sleeping shirt over my head and called my wife. As I called, I ran, sprinted to the bus, checking every nook and cranny between neighbours’ houses and looking into trees and bushes. My wife screamed at me through the receiver, calling me ungodly names that I still shrink into myself thinking about.

  As I reached the stop, there was no sign of the boy, just a vacant bench and a sun bleached timesheet for the bus. I collapsed onto the bench and hung up on my wife, dialing the police.



My wife and I split, we had to. She hated me and I hated myself more. I still remember locking eyes with her as she came through the door on the fateful day, it wasn’t sadness, it was unfiltered rage, pure resentment for me. Her first response was to yank a cop out of the way and stab my face with her car key, leaving a horrendous scar that burned for a month after.

  I quit my job and used my savings to keep myself afloat for the next year and a half. I was abandoned at my house, with Leroy’s dusty, rotting toys. The cops found essentially nothing, a single ring doorbell picked up my son walking past their house at 7:35, the final minute my son was seen alive or even seen at all. I kept the video, I watch it at least once a week, he looked so scared, his head darting around at any and all noises, his first walk alone. The bus we took was old, it had no cameras aboard it and when the driver was questioned he claimed he never remembered my son getting on but apparently Gary did. His response was as odd and whimsical as per usual, “The boy got on the bus, he sat with me like they all tend to. Rode til the end, if it weren’t that day it were the day after.”

  They questioned Gary on and off for months but he was found innocent, his response was apparently a tale, a warning to the officer who he knew had a child.

  When my money ran out I started to starve, I bought less and less food. I didn’t want to work, I wanted to be home as often as I could and so I rationed my money but eventually it ran too low and I got my old job back, a simple clerk at a book store. I dreaded knowing what that meant, I needed to take my old bus again.



I trudged down the roads I did most weeks to get the midday bus to get food but during the early hours of the morning the streets felt haunted. Every so often I would see a blur or an animal darting away from my sight and I would tell myself it was him, hiding from me, scared. I had to shake the feeling to stop myself from crying. I reached the bus stop and planted myself down, tapping the heel of my work shoes onto the concrete. I had an odd anticipation welling in my gut, like I would see Leroy on the bus, older, waiting for me. As it squealed to a stop at exactly 8:00 I entered, the driver was the same as from a year prior, a middle aged black man named Grant. He squinted at me and his jaw briefly dipped in confusion, “Freddy? You’re back?”

  I just nodded and tapped my card against the reader, hoping it still worked. The light flicked green and Grant took off, I saw his eyes looking at me as I sat down, a few seats in front of Gary.

  “Hey son,” his voice flowed through the air like an old memory, “you holding up well enough?”

  I turned in my chair and stared into his cheery eyes with my vacant sockets, “No Gary, I’m not well at all.” I swiveled back and stared at my bus card that I tapped against my palm.

  “Sorry bout ya boy,” his voice retained a wrinkle of a smile, it made me sick, “I promise he got all the way to the final stop.”

  I stood up and stormed over to him, trying to stay upright as the bus drove around corners and over bumps, “What the fuck is that supposed to mean, Gary?” I spat through gritted teeth.

  “Oh Fred, he was here, he was okay.” He frowned a genuine frown and guilt rose in my stomach, “Try not to swear please, there’s a kid present.”

  I looked down at his grandson, Gary ran his fingers through his blond hair and the boy smiled softly in his sleep. I went to apologise and the bus lurched to a stop suddenly, I caught myself on the handle of a seat and spun around. Even with so much time that had passed, the bus stopping at a stop between the first and the school was unnatural to me and threw me off.

  I turned to face the front and saw a younger man get on, he had too many freckles and a messy clot of red hair. His arms were covered in small bruises and scars and his face had small red blotches on it. Looking at his pale knuckles his hands were noticeably purple. He tapped his card and then a snarl grew across his face as he looked at me. “What the fuck are you doing to poor Gary?” He yelled to me and I was thrown off, pausing for only a second, “Hey!?”

  “Nothing man, nothing!” I said back like a loser, whimpering at a man five years my junior.

  Gary stuck his old shaking hand up, “Please stop it with this bothersome swearing! Freddy here was just catching up with me, not attacking me or causing any distress.”

  The young man blew a vicious line of air through his lips and scratched his arm awkwardly, “Sorry dude, poor Gary got hurt by some old drunk a coupla days back, thought it was time for round two!” He chuckled to himself and I realised where the bruising across his body came from.

  “You gave him the work then.” I said, gesturing to his flesh adornments.

  “Yessir, fucker could barely walk after.”

  “Nice, thanks for looking after this one.” I halfassed waved towards Gary and found a new seat.

  As I looked back to my fading card I felt the seat dip next to me and looked to see the man staring at me, I could already tell what he was looking at, my scar. “My wife gave it to me, I deserved it though.”

  “Cheat on her?”

  “Lost her son.”

  He ran his fingers through his knotted hair and then it clicked in his brain, “You’re THAT Fred, Gary told me about ya, a lost soul wandering a track of despair, heading to the station of doom or some shit.” He swung around to look at Gary, “Right?”

  Gary huffed, “The basic idea, I suppose.”

  The red haired fighter then looked me in the eyes, “Sorry about your son, he’s alive, I can feel it.”

  “Thanks.” I mumbled, looking away, tears filling my eyes.

  “Oh also bad news big man,” he said in a joking tone, “I think I took ya job.”



The man and I got acquainted pretty quickly after that, he was a fast talker and was able to distract me out of my depressed stupor for minutes at a time. He was Kayden Walker and he literally took my old job and I was moved to the backroom, cataloguing and pricing donated books. I got Kayden’s number and ended up texting him immediately, he was a good change of pace and was funny to boot.

  I took the next few weeks one day at a time, boarded the bus, caught up with Gary and his grandkid and then moved to sit with Kayden. Gary never seemed to mind, he liked being alone with his boy, holding him tight enough that he wouldn’t sway and fall but not too tight to wake him or hurt his little arms. Kayden quickly became a good friend, we even got beers after work a few times and I grew, ever so slowly, happy again.

  I still waited on my front patio every evening, waiting for Leroy, hoping for him but at least now the buzz of my phone and a shitty meme I didn’t understand would lighten the mood ever so slightly.

  Then Gary spoke to me one morning and shifted everything back into place, like a bulldozer he set the ground flat again and my attempt to climb the hill to peace was quashed. “You’re more observant than most Fred,” he spoke with slight malice in his breath and it took me out of my distracted staring at the quickling passing trees, “you notice more than even Kayden or the driver.”

  “Pardon?” I shot back, confused at what I had seen and they all missed.

  He straightened his back and nestled his grandson closer to himself, “You still miss the subtle things in my stories though, just like your son.” My mind began to go ever so cloudy, my hands trembled and I let him continue, “Your son couldn’t ever find the message, the reason I told him about my stories, my warnings.” He swallowed and continued, now with a saddened frown, “If he had, he wouldn’t have passed on. He wouldn’t have reached the end of the line.”

  I rose from my seat and stared down at his frail body and he didn’t flinch, just slowly ran his thumb through the sleeping boy’s hair, “Please get to the point, Gary.”

  He chuckled, “Missed it again, another warning flies by.”

  “Gary.” I said sternly.

  “Who do you think I am?” He asked, “Do you think I’m Gary? Are you sure?”

  My head spun and I nearly stumbled back to my seat, his words always had a sense of dread to them, like I missed an awful point I shouldn’t have, “I don’t know, are you Gary?”

  The question felt so odd to ask, *are you Gary?* I was asking if the man I knew as Gary, if he was the man I knew as Gary and yet asking him felt so important. He perked up, “Do you want the literal answer or the metaphorical answer?”

  “I don’t know.”

  “It doesn’t really matter, both answers are the same.” He snickered and his crooked finger rose to beckon me in. I leaned down so he could whisper in my ear, I felt so foolish, so belittled but I wanted to know why he brought up Leroy, I wanted to know if he knew something. He spoke and the warmth hit my ear from his wrinkled lips, “I’m the Grim Reaper, I take them to the end of the line.”

  The bus jolted to a stop and I crashed into the floor as Kayden walked on, laughing at my tumble, “Woaaahhh, stop the ship, man down!” He bellowed out, cupping his hands over his mouth. He leaned over to scoop me up and I looked at his pale face and blue eyes. His bruises were clearing up and he had such a warm smile. I began to cry.



The remainder of the bus ride I felt nauseous, I wanted to ask more but it felt wrong too. It felt more like I had the pieces to a puzzle and needed to shape them back together, asking for a clue would yield nothing.

  At work I couldn’t concentrate and mislabeled nearly five books in a row, so I excused myself and went home early. At my house I ignored text after text from Kayden, he was sending messages, asking if I was okay, if I needed help. I responded only with, “I’ll see you at work tomorrow.”

  I ended up searching the roads near my house for Leroy that night, I had no exact reason why, just felt like I hadn’t done it in a while. I fell asleep on the patio, waking up covered in mosquito bites and dirt in my hair. I checked his room, hoping he wandered back in as simply as he had wandered out but there was no such luck.

  I pulled my work shirt on, sprayed an ungodly amount of deodorant on and stumbled down the road to the bus stop. I rolled my phone in my hand, working out in my head what I would say to Gary, what I would ask him. I couldn’t tell if I liked him or hated him, if what he said was meant to be kind or cruel. Helpful or to deter me. I couldn’t tell if he knew everything or nothing at all.

  I planted myself on the bench and waited. I saw the bright fifty-five tumble over a hill and rose to get on but the bus didn’t stop, it just drove past me. The last thing I saw was Gary smiling and the top of his grandson’s head, his brown hair drooping down and covering his ears, then the bus vanished into the distance.
