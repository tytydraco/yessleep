Weeks after we all played [the Funeral Game](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ky9hyf/the_funeral_game_part_1/), Abby asked to meet Joel and me in the park. She was the only one who stilled asked if anybody had heard from Collin. The answer was always *no*. She tapped her fingers on the park bench before going any further.

“I want to go in the coffin,” she said.

Joel and I both recoiled at the thought.

“What?” he shouted, then he leaned in to whisper, “after whatever happened to Collin?”

“It’s not a game worth playing,” I added. “We’ve seen that it’s real. Isn’t that good enough?”

“It’s not good enough for me,” she said. “I want to see what happens in there. Joel, do you still have the key?”

Joel checked his surroundings and kept his voice low.

“Yes, I’ve got it,” he said. “Honestly, I didn’t even go back up the hill to lock the door again.”

“Fine. Just lock it when we get there so we can do the whole ritual,” Abby said.

Joel shook his head.

“I’m not comfortable going back there. We don’t know what we’re playing with.”

“Maybe we can learn more about it!” Abby shook him by the shoulder.

“No way,” Joel held his hands up and stood to leave. “The door’s unlocked. If you go in, it’s on you.”

I stuck around to talk Abby out of it.

“You saw what happened to Collin,” I said. “Whatever goes on between the mausoleum and the grave, it’s not good.”

“But it’s *real*,” she insisted. “Something unexplainable happened that night. Aren’t you curious what it means? We have the chance to experience something supernatural, maybe even get a glimpse of the afterlife!”

My hair stood on end.

“If that’s what it is, I don’t think we’re meant to see it before our time, right? It scared the hell out of Collin.”

Abby didn’t miss a beat.

“Well, maybe that was just *his* afterlife. It could be beautiful! We won’t know until we see it for ourselves.”

She had a hand on my arm, and her grip was starting to pinch. Normally, I got a bright, warm feeling whenever she put a hand on me, but now I was eager to get away.  

“You could end up buried alive with who knows what down there with you,” I said. “Even if it *is* that spectacular, I don’t think it’s worth the risk.”

Her face darkened and she shoved my arm away.

“It’s worth it to me!” Her voice choked. “I just want to know there’s something else after this.”

I soothed the red mark on my arm and felt like an ass. Abby’s father died just before our freshman year.

“I get it. Sorry.”

“Yeah, sorry.” She started to simmer down. “I just want to see if we get another chance.”

“Alright,” I stood and put a very cautious hand on her shoulder. “I’ll see if I can talk Joel into it. We’ll need the help.”

\*\*\*

I left the park and paid a visit to Collin’s house, hoping he could tell me more about what he saw. When I knocked on his front door, his mother told me that he hadn’t been feeling well. He needed to rest and he couldn’t come down to talk. As I left, I felt an awful heat on my back. I looked up to Collin’s window, but I knew that wasn’t him watching me.

The eyes glowed like embers, and in the late, low sun, there was the same corpse I saw in the mausoleum. I felt trapped in its gaze, unable to move until it lost interest and turned away from the window.

I stuck close to the streetlights all the way to Joel’s house after that.

“Listen, I’m still creeped out about this whole thing,” he said. “I’ll give you the key if that takes me out of the picture. I don’t want to go back to that cemetery until after I’ve croaked.”

“I don’t blame you,” I said. “But Abby’s got her heart set on seeing what happens down there. Think about her, man. Maybe it could give her some piece of mind about losing her dad if she sees something supernatural. A little peek at the other side.”

“Collin saw the other side and he’s been a ghost ever since.”

“Maybe it won’t be so bad for her.” I didn’t mention the creep I saw in Collin’s window.

Joel scoffed. “I don’t know, man. Maybe.”

“I can’t dig her up on my own, Joel. Not in time to pull her out alive.” I looked him in the eye and saw the dread gathered there like dark clouds.   

“Fine,” he said. “But after this, I’m throwing the key in a lake.”

\*\*\*

On the next half moon, the three of us went back to the cemetery. Abby started up the hill before Joel had even shut off the truck, and we hustled to catch up. It looked like she was waiting for us before she went into the mausoleum, but she scowled at Joel when we made it to the top.

“I thought it was still unlocked,” she said.

Joel rattled the door, but it wouldn’t give.

“I never locked it,” he said. He hesitated before producing the old key and knocking again.

The rusty lock clanked and surrendered, and with some effort, we pushed the iron door open.

Abby went straight for the coffin and knocked. Joel and I joined her around the box and opened the lid. I braced for the sight of something horrid when the coffin lid shifted away, but there was no grinning corpse inside this time.

“Help me up,” she said.

I hoisted her by the belt loops as she sprang up onto the slab.

“Up we go,” I said like an idiot.

She stood in the coffin and took a deep breath, then carefully eased down onto her back.

“Alright. Close it up,” she told us.

Joel and I shared a worried glance before lifting up the lid. It was much harder to maneuver without Collin’s help. We propped it up against the foot of the coffin.

“Are you sure you want to do this, Abby?” I couldn’t hide the unease in my voice.

She cinched her lips tight and nodded. Then, we slid the lid over her. 

Outside, the breeze picked up, tugging at our clothes and whipping our hair as we made our laps around the mausoleum.

“Maybe this time will be different,” I told myself loud enough for Joel to hear.

“You’d better hope,” he said, his voice nearly snuffed in the growing wind.

The cemetery below was shrouded in darkness as black clouds swallowed the moonlight.

We completed the three circles and returned to the tomb, the whole chamber resonating with the moaning wind. The sight of the coffin sent a baleful pang through me, the same sobering ache I always got when I entered a sanctuary for someone’s wake. I had to remind myself that when all this was over, Abby would still be alive.

I knocked on the lid, and there was no answer.

“Let’s open it just to be sure,” Joel said.

Maybe we were both trembling with fear. For whatever reason, the coffin lid seemed twice as heavy, and it slammed down as we began to lift. A blazing sting coursed through my hands and I recoiled in pain. The coffin had bitten down on my fingers, blotting the tips with red and purple.

“That’s not going to help,” Joel said.

Through the pain, I tried again.

Abby wasn’t there.

We rushed out into the cemetery in search of the candlelight. I hoped that the cloud coverage would help the small flame stand out, but the darkness only made the graveyard more treacherous. We started with the upper tiers on the hill, scrambling through a maze of obelisks and statues—somber figures and petrified angels with wings outstretched in the night.

Whenever we played the Funeral Game, the cemetery changed. It was most severe at the top of the hill, surrounding the mausoleum. As I hurried through the monuments, I heard graves hum under my feet. My flashlight would twist its beam in directions I wasn’t pointing. Wings brushed over my head. I forced myself not to look directly at the statues, because I could tell they were looking back.

As we made our way down the hill, I saw a light. It was too bright to be a candle. It was a window glowing from the funeral home at the far end of the cemetery. Someone was still there at this late hour, and I prayed they couldn’t hear us over the wind.

I watched for anyone to step outside, then I heard Joel call me. He found the candle. We met at the truck, and I told him about the funeral home as he tossed me a shovel.

“Never mind them,” he said. “We’ve got to hurry!”

He led me to the candlelit grave and drove his shovel into the grass. As I joined him, I watched the candle’s flame shiver in the wind. Then the cemetery roared with thunder. Joel muttered something foul and hurled dirt over his shoulder.

The noise started at the far end of the graveyard, a loud, frenzied pattering, and then crossed the field with imminent speed. As we toiled away, the rain beat down on our backs, soaking our clothes and blending fully with the sweat and tears falling onto the grave.

We needed Collin. The two of us worked as hard as we could, but the deluge and the mud made the dig so much worse. Sporadic lightning flashes showed us how little progress we were making, but then the light fell on us and stayed. It wasn’t lightning. Joel and I stopped digging as we realized that we were caught in the headlights of a police cruiser.

I spat rain and stammered, trying to decide where to start. There was too much to explain and my panicked mind wasn’t prepared. The officer wasn’t about to stand in the rain and wait for an excuse, anyway. Before I could form a complete thought, he had us in the back of his squad car.

He slammed his door and eyed Joel from the rearview.

“I told you what would happen if you got caught.” His voice was much like Joel’s, just a few steps deeper. When he turned to face us, I realized that he was Joel’s brother, Jason.   

“We were only going to try it once,” Joel argued. “We didn’t expect the game to work, but it does. That’s why we were digging. Somebody’s down there and we need to get them out!”

“Save it,” Jason said. “We’ve already been called out here once about somebody disturbing a plot. If it turned out that it’s you, there’s nothing I could do to help. You’re lucky I’m the one who found you here.”

“I don’t care what happens to me,” Joel said. “We’ve got a friend trapped in that grave. Let us out and help us dig!”

“Hell no!” Jason said. “I’m taking you home.”

“We can’t leave without her!” I pleaded.

Jason turned to me with narrow, seething eyes.

“Look, the station got a call from the funeral home. They saw someone walking around the mausoleum. They don’t know who you are, and they don’t know you were digging. I can make up whatever report I need to and that’ll be the end of it. Right now, you’re only in trouble with me, and that’s bad enough. I can make it so much worse.”

Joel tried to open the cruiser door, but of course, it was locked.

Jason reached a hand back to his brother, palm-up.

“The game’s over,” his voice was flat and sullen. “Give me the key, buddy. I know you’ve got it.”

Joel reluctantly checked his pockets, then stuttered.

“I uh… I left it in the mausoleum.”

“I’ll get it later,” Jason sighed. “I’ll have to come back for the truck, anyway.” He set the cruiser in reverse and turned to take us home. “What a sick game,” he said to himself.

As we were taken away, I watched water overflow in the holes we had dug. The candle had been extinguished while we were arguing.

\*\*\*

My parents stayed up with me in the den all night. They wouldn’t let me go back out, and nothing I said could convince them that Abby was in danger. They were far more worried about me, and the more I spoke, the more concern they showed.

They couldn’t believe that Abby just disappeared only to end up trapped underground. I tried explaining what happened to Collin, but they excused it as an elaborate prank, all part of a game that I shouldn’t have been playing in the first place. When I told them how Collin had changed, they weren’t that surprised. Apparently, all my friends were “a little weird” to begin with.

I didn’t fall asleep until well after sunrise. I don’t think Joel got any rest either. Abby wasn’t in class the next day, and Jason was at her house that afternoon to field a missing person report.

Joel and I were both questioned, but Jason dismissed anything I said about the Funeral Game as delusion.

I had to grieve losing Collin even though I knew he was still alive. It was harder with Abby. Playing the game was her idea, but we helped her every step of the way. I even gave her a hand into the coffin. This time, grief wasn’t alone. It came with guilt, and they followed me like shadows everywhere. It was bad enough during the day, but like shadows, they swallowed everything at night.

I decided not to enroll in college, not yet anyway. I wasn’t ready to move on. Therapy helped some—learning to live with loss and all—but coping with supernatural traps isn’t something a psychologist is prepared for. 

Joel and I both graduated, even if neither of us were that focused anymore. We didn’t walk, though. When our school held our graduation ceremony on the football field, we sat on his tailgate in a downtown parking lot, just far enough away so that we could barely hear the names called out over the PA.  

If Collin were there, *maybe* he could have scored us a six pack, but we weren’t celebrating that night.

“What do you think you’ll do now?” I asked.

“No idea,” Joel answered, staring up to an empty moon.

“I’ve got no plans,” I said, looking up and down the short strip of storefronts on either side of the parking lot. Most of the windows displayed “space for lease” signs. “It’s not like there’s much to do here.”

I hadn’t spent much time around Joel since we lost Abby. I wasn’t avoiding him, but I knew he was hurting too. Even so, I had a question that had been grating on me since the night we gathered in his basement, and I didn’t want to wait any longer.

“How did you get ahold of that key?” I asked. “There’s no point keeping a secret now.”

Joel met my eyes for only a second before looking away.

“Jason let me have it in exchange for ratting out Timothy.”

Timothy wasn’t a close friend, but he was handy. In certain circles, he developed a reputation as a reliable hookup for weed and other diversions. He was busted for dealing a few weeks before we first played the Funeral Game.

I tried not to hold it against Joel as I pressed him further.

“Ok, but where did Jason get it?”

“It was at the station,” Joel said. “In an evidence locker.”

Grief can stir up a lot of emotions. Day to day, it’s a revolving door. Up until then, I’d become very familiar with sorrow and regret. In the truck with Joel, a searing anger slammed its hands on my shoulders and growled hate in my ear. My throat burned and my jaw tensed. My chest pounded with a war drum beat. Joel *knew* the game was dangerous.

He knew something terrible had happened before and he dragged us into it anyway. I fought for words.

“I’m sorry,” he said.

I want to scream, to shake him by the collar and tell him to go to hell. I wanted to hurt him. But I swallowed the venom that had pooled in my mouth. I took my time. I held it together.

“Alright,” I sighed. “I guess the key is back in the locker now. Nobody else can use it again.”

Joel held still.

“It’s not there,” he said. “Jason went back for my truck, but he said that the key wasn’t in the mausoleum. He never recovered it.”

I heard my name called from far away, but I didn’t say anything.

\*\*\*

Abby’s parents never gave up hope. As long as there was no body, no “goodbye” letter, no sign of foul play, they insisted she could still be alive out there somewhere. No evidence was all the evidence they needed to hold on.

Collin’s family didn’t have that luxury. He disappeared that summer, and a groundskeeper discovered his body inside the mausoleum one morning. Although he had only been missing a few days, he was found in an advanced state of decay, kneeling at the foot of the slab.

Collin was cremated in a small ceremony at the funeral home. It was the closest Joel and I had been to the cemetery in months. Neither of us wanted to be there, but it gave me the closure I didn’t realize I had been waiting for. We lost him a long time ago, but we finally got to say goodbye.

Before we left, Collin’s mother took me aside.

“He left something for you,” she said. She led me to her car and took a cigar box from the back seat. A folded letter addressed to me was taped to the lid. “I found this in his closet. Don’t worry, I didn’t open it.”

She hugged me and thanked me for being there. If she did the same for Joel, I didn’t notice.

I opened the letter as soon as I got home:

“I know where Abby went. If you’re reading this, then I’ve gone there, too. There’s a place between the coffin and the grave. I feel like part of me is still down there and something else came back in my place. I see it in the mirror, and I can feel it taking over. My body doesn’t want whatever this thing is. Every day I’m closer to death. I find bugs in my clothes and my bed sheets. I can barely sleep. When I close my eyes, noises like horns explode in my head. I murmur to myself but I don’t know what I’m saying. I smell death everywhere. There’s no coming back for me, but you know the rules. As long as your candle stays lit, there’s hope for you. You can find her again. All you need is in the box.”

I folded the letter and unlatched the cigar box. Inside was the rusty iron key.
