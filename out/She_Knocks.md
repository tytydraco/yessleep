I’ve been a detective for a long, *long* time. Probably longer than some of you have been alive. Working in this field of work I’ve come across a lot of the gruesome, disturbing, and horrific things gods rejects have done to other innocent people. But in this case… I’ve never seen anything like it. I’m honestly at my wits end here and don’t know what to believe anymore.

So I’ve turned here. I’m sure many of you are experts when it comes to this stuff, so I want your honest opinions on this one.

For some context: a young woman (five foot three, blonde hair, blue eyes) was brought into the station disheveled and covered in blood and dust. Officers had picked her up after some neighbors called with some noise complaints. When they entered the residence she was crouched on the ground next to the dead body of her fiancé writing in a journal.  A bloody hammer laid on the ground next to her. 

Standard murder case, you crime junkies might be thinking, but it is so much more than that. And if my Sergeant ever found out I stole police evidence and posted it to social media I’d lose my job immediately. After taking this case though, I couldn’t care less. I’m getting up there in age anyway and this old fart would rather like to retire after this particular case.

Anyway, I’ll just let the evidence tell you. Below are entries from a leather bound journal that was collected from the scene of the crime. The one the woman was writing in. It seems it was being used as some sort of diary/dream journal.

Hello Journal! My name is Lorelei Wilson and my fiancé George and I are going to buy our first house together! I’m keeping this as a log of our journey; from buying the house, to renovating, and hopefully to document building a nursery! Gosh, I feel like I’m thirteen again writing in my diary about my latest boy crush! Spoiler alert: it’s George! 

Honey if you ever read this, I love you and can’t wait to take the next step with you!

I’m happy to announce that after almost two weeks of looking at houses on Zillow and going to a few open houses and some other house tours, I think we’ve finally found the one! 8374 Maplewood Drive for only thirteen thousand! I was surprised how cheap they were selling the place considering how beautiful the property is. Two story, four bedroom, two bath with marvelous wood flooring. The outside interior is a nice pearl white with a blue door that makes it pop! My favorite is the stereotypical white picket fence though, ha! There’s also a study on the first floor so I’m thinking of turning that into our office!

Not only is the house itself beautiful but it has this intense aura about it, like it’s drawing me in somehow. It’s one of the reasons why it’s my first choice at the moment! I think we’re even going to put in an offer later today!!

I wonder why the address seems so familiar to me though…

Okay I’m even more excited about buying this house now!!! Not only did our offer get accepted, but after I did some research, I figured out why the house’s address seemed so familiar to me! Turns out this is the house where Harriet Yarnsivick mysteriously disappeared into thin air five years ago. Oh George and I remember watching the news updates on the case when it was first sensationalized, but eventually the case went cold and I guess everyone forgot about it. How sad, I hope she’s okay if she’s still alive. 

There was a lot of controversy surrounding the case too. Nobody knew how a girl could just up and disappear like that. All her belongings, purse, phone, and even shoes were still at the house. Police say there weren’t any signs of forced entry or anything either. Harriet lived with three other housemates and they were all questioned, but none of them had a motive and were all at a house party that night with many corroborating witnesses. The house was spick and span clean, just how the other roommates had left it.

This case is so interesting! I might update my true crime blog and document living in this house! (Lord knows I’ve been neglecting updating it!)

I’ve always loved things like this, and Nancy Drew was my role model as a little girl. Who knows, maybe I’ll find clue’s Investigators missed and even solve the mystery!

IT'S MOVE IN DAY!!!

George thinks he’s quite funny. I had mentioned when we had arrived in the moving truck how perfect the house looked, how it stood proud and strong on its foundations. He said it was morbid then proceeded to ask why he was marrying me again. I gave him a good nudge in the shoulder for that last remark!  He knows very well that he likes the house just as much as I do, and found its history interesting, hell he co-signed the lease!

Anyway we’re both super excited about living here and also super tired and exhausted from moving. On the plus side we had pizza for dinner! Ate on the floor surrounded by boxes and everything. Can’t wait for when we get the internet and cable in a few days.

I never really have been good at sleeping in unfamiliar spaces. I think my body is still adjusting to the move and my residual excitement and giddiness didn’t help either. Man, I couldn’t sleep a wink last night! Other than that, things have been fine. George got called into work today so I stayed home and started unpacking. The kitchen feels more like a kitchen with dishes in the cabinets and a proper dining table. After a short nap I’ll go to the store and stock up on food.

George is mad at me. I might’ve snapped at him a little about the placement of the tv in the living room earlier. I get cranky when I’m tired and I haven’t been sleeping the best at night. But it’s okay because I’m mad at George too. The other night I could’ve sworn I heard someone knocking. I couldn’t pinpoint the location where it was coming from but the small, quiet, and repetitious knocks were there. I’m a light sleeper so I wasn’t able to go back to sleep until the knocking ended at around four in the morning. 

I brought it up to George in the morning, and since he’s a heavy sleeper and didn’t hear anything, he doesn’t believe me. 

Anyway, I finished setting up the study this morning. I found a picture of Harriet and her roommates stuck between some bookshelves so that was a cool find. She looked happy. There was a draft coming from somewhere in there though. I’ll have to fix it and put that on my to-do list.

Taking some advice from my friend Chelsea, I’m going to start dream journaling, and this just so happened to be the only available journal I had. I’m too tired to drive to the store and get another one.

I’ve been able to get more sleep than I have in the past few days but not too much more. Every night until four am I’m lying awake in my bed, eyes wide open, as the knocks emanate through the house. George says he still hasn’t heard anything, but I know they’re there. Taunting me in their steady, continuous drumming. Maybe one of these days when I’m not as terrified, I’ll go and find where the knocks are coming from. 

But when I am sleeping I’m having these crazy and vivid dreams. I’d never vividly dreamed before this so the first time it happened last night it felt super real.

I can’t quite remember where I was but the space felt familiar. I remember feeling frantic, panicked, and scared. I had locked myself away somewhere, but I knew danger was right around the corner. Then all of a sudden this giant shadowy silhouette appeared and it lunged at me with a weapon, I think it was a hammer but I’m not sure. When it made contact with my head I woke up. I was covered in sweat and dazed. George woke up and comforted me when he saw the state I was in. I was a little less mad at him after that. 

Maybe these dreams are caused by my sleep exhaustion.

If I’m not going to be getting much sleep, I might as well do something with that time. I’ve gone into a rabbit hole with the Yarnsivick case, doing research for my blog. 

So Harriet had three other roommates, Joanne Harris, her brother David Harris, and another guy named Antonio Frump. Joanne and Antonio were an item and Harriet knew them all because she was Joanne’s good friend from college. 

A bunch of interviews from people that knew Harriet suspected that she and David were romantically involved and claimed David was responsible for her disappearance. According to police though his alibi checked out and there was no way he could’ve been there. There isn’t an estimated time of disappearance either. She really did just vanish out of thin air. 

Since there was no other information about the case available online I turned to social media.

At some point I had fallen asleep while scrolling and I had the same vivid dream from the other night. This time it was more intense, I could feel the hatred and anger coming off the shadow figure. It was angry, determined, desperate. I could make out my surroundings now and realized why it was so familiar. 

It was the study.

This dream was different from the other one that’s been playing on repeat the past few nights. It was like a movie. I think I’ve been digging too much into this case because it’s infecting my mind. In the dream I was Harriet. I was at a house party just chilling along with Jo and then her brother, David, entered the room. I think it was the first time I had seen him because it felt like my heart started racing and he looked cute, but unfamiliar. He was charming, funny. Knew how to make me laugh. I had an overall good time. 

The dream ended after he handed me a red solo cup full of some liquid.

After I woke up I started digging through my notes. Surely enough Jo and Harriet had met at a house party, but I didn’t find anything about David being there. 

Ah shit, I forgot it was Valentine’s Day! George came home pissed while I was researching. He slammed the front door, threw a pretty bouquet of flowers at my feet, and then angrily grumbled up the stairs to our bedroom. I had accidentally stood him up. Oh I forgot I was supposed to meet up with him for dinner after his shift ended! I was too busy digging through old notes that I didn’t check my phone to see his texts or calls.

Losing all this sleep has made me super forgetful.

OK either I’m fucking loosing it or the knocking has started during the day time too. It feels like whatever is in the walls is surrounding me. Knocking twenty for seven, trying to get out. My head is pounding. I begged George to believe me, to call an exterminator to check for mice, anything but he won’t. He hasn’t been home or awake, so he hasn't heard the knocking. Even when I hear it he doesn’t.

I wish George would get over Valentine’s Day and just help me. He’s made me sleep on the couch for the past few days.

Researching and updating my blog is all that comforts me.

We had sex. SO MUCH SEX! We fuck like bunnies, David and I. In my dreams I mean…

But he’s so sweet and handsome though. He takes me out on dates, plays with my hair, just a genuine guy. And Joanne. My dear, sweet, Joanne. She’s so supportive of our relationship and happy for me and her brother. It’s like we’re soulmates.

Jeez these dreams feel so real, like I’m actually her.

Sometimes I like to think I am Harriet. 

But the only thing that tethers me is the rumors of David and her being an item. There’s no proof. David, Joanne, and Antonio all denied them being in a relationship to the press and to the police.

Fuck I’m so horny. Maybe David and I can have a little fun later when he comes home from work.

Oops! Silly little me, I meant George. Maybe I’m actually starting to lose my marbles.

George has officially lost it! He’s having me involuntarily committed! All because he came home to a mess in the study today! 

So I might’ve had a dream where David showed a notebook of poems he had written to Harriet. I woke up and remembered seeing it somewhere in the study. After I didn’t find it in the book shelves I kinda went haywire and tore up the office a little bit. But I SWEAR I had seen that notebook before. I really do need to find the source of that draft, it’s freezing in there!

He says this was his last straw. “I’m sleep deprived and delusional!” Me? Delusional?!? He’s the crazy one if he can’t hear the incessant knocks that comes from the fucking walls everyday! Me, crazy! Guess that’s why he’s sending me to the nut house.

I’m seriously reconsidering our engagement.

David would’ve made a better husband than George anyway.

I’m sneaking my journal in with me >:)

David is an abusive asshole and I wish I never fell in love with him! The red flags were there this whole time! He was super possessive of me everywhere we went, he wouldn’t let me talk to other boys, and he accused me of cheating on him every other week! Now he’s finally done it. He’s hit me! 

I’ve turned into his personal punching bag the past few days. I’m scared and terrified of setting him off again. And Jo! She just stands by and lets it happen. I’ve begged her to help me but she won’t, claiming that he’s her brother and she’d never do anything to ruin his reputation. Some fucking friend.

I’ve started looking for other places to live. I’m going to do it. I’m going to leave David once and for all.

I’ve been released from my seventy two hour hold. They haven’t found anything wrong with me and I just slept for most of the time. I feel much better now. My head isn’t swimming anymore and I’m not tired. I think I slept for a good twentyish hours in there. George was so happy to see me, and I him. We had a nice long hug when he came to pick me up. 

I think things are going to get better from here on out.

ITS SO LOUD! The knocking. Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, KNOCK, KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK! MAKE IT STOP!

Ever since I got back yesterday it’s been constant non stop knocking. I have a headache. Eventually I passed out due to the pain.

David did it. He killed me. He found out I was planning on leaving him and he freaked. I was going to make my escape when they were at the house party. He somehow found out and left the party to come confront me. When he cornered me… he tried to rape me. I eventually got away and hid in the study. He smashed my phone so I couldn’t call for help or do anything. He smashed the doorknob off with a hammer. When he realized I wouldn’t go back to him he killed me! Bashed my skull in with the hammer! You want to know the worst part? I was still alive when he stuffed me in that wall. I watched as he replaced the broken door knob. Screamed in horror as he moved the bookshelf in front of the small hole he had created. I cried and cried but nobody heard me. Eventually I passed out from exhaustion and suffocated.

I know where the banging is coming from. I have one of George’s hammers, and I grabbed it from his tool bag. I’m headed for the study. 

I’m ending it, once and for all.

It feels like a jackhammer is drilling into my ears. The knocking is the loudest in the study. I’m just so over it! My head is pounding! I’m tired, exhausted! I just want it to STOP! 

I was scared! David came downstairs when he heard me smashing the bookcases in the study. He yelled at me, screamed! I was so scared he was going to hit me. Kill me again. I hate David! I hate him with a burning passion!

Everything was crescendoing around me! The knocking was so loud it felt like my brain was about to explode. David was screaming in my ear, grabbing me, trying to hurt me! I just wanted everything to stop. I wanted him to stop hurting me!

I hit him in the head with my hammer. Then I hit him again and again until his brains turned to mush. I just have to laugh. I finally got revenge on David. Did what that fucker did to me. He’s quiet now. Quiet is good.

Then I went back to hitting the wall. With every hit the knocking diminished. Finally it was quiet when the bookshelf was destroyed. It was peaceful.

There was a small hole in the wall that was hidden behind the bookshelf.

I found her. I found Harriet.

There’s flashing red and blue lights outside. Good. They’ll be able to help.

I really don’t know if this journal will be enough evidence to convict David Harris for the murder or Harriet Yarnsivick. These are more like the ramblings of a madwoman than a credible confession. I don’t know if the prosecution will see this as admissible in court. 

As for Lorelei Wilson, she’s being charged for the murder of her fiancé George Finch. They found him with his head bashed in. Brain matter and skull fragments everywhere. Poor guy. They found Lorelei scribbling in the journal when they entered the scene. In the wall they found the skeletal remains of Ms. Yarnsivick. Her skull had been bashed in. 

It appears her assailant killed her, moved the bookshelf and created a makeshift grave in the wall where they stuffed her body and moved the bookshelf back.

I have no clue how investigators didn’t smell the decomposition, or notice that the bookshelf had been moved, but the tenants quickly moved out after the girls disappearance and the house was left vacant for five years. Nobody complained of  a rotting smell in that time. 

Again, I really don’t know what to believe here. It seems like Ms. Yarnsivicks ghost haunted Ms. Wilson and drove her insane until she discovered her remains. But that’s crazy right? Ghosts don’t exist! 

Anyway I better finish up here, it seems like someone is knocking at my door.
