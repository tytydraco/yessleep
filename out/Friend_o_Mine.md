I couldn’t rest at all because of the nightmares. As I walked into the kitchen, the smell of onions and garlic filled the air. Mom was busy cooking lunch.

“I hear it louder each time,” I said, watching her struggle with our old, dull knife to cut a carrot.

“You should stop staying up late playing, sweetheart,” she replied, barely glancing at me. “Maybe the lack of sleep is causing those nightmares. You could take a nap after you finish feeding the goats.”

For days now, I’d been plagued by the same dream every time I closed my eyes. In it, I was always alone, standing in front of the well a few meters from our house. The lamps inside were off, and through the windows, I could see nothing but darkness. And yet, I could feel something watching me from within the house.

Then came the sound. At first, it was just an unintelligible mix of whispers and knocks. But night after night, it became clearer. The whispers turned into a voice that called my name. “Sue, Sue, Sue.” Each time, I froze in terror. I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn’t move. The voice trapped me, like it had control over me.

I’d wake up in a cold sweat, unable to shake the feeling of dread. Falling back asleep was impossible. I felt like I was losing more energy each day, the dark circles under my eyes growing deeper. But no matter how tired I was, the thought of facing that dream again kept me awake.

"I'm too scared to go near that well," I admitted to Mom, my voice barely above a whisper. “What if the monster in the well pulls me in?”

“There’s no monster in that well, Sue. It’s just a bad dream,” she said firmly, pausing her chopping to look at me. “Going near it might help you overcome your fear.”

I didn’t argue. I’d learned my lesson the last time I insisted; it had ended with me grounded for two days. Instead, I left the house and walked toward the well. The sun was high in the sky, and birds chirped cheerfully, as if mocking the fear that weighed on me.

When I reached the well, I stopped and stared at it. It looked harmless in the daylight, just an old, weathered stone structure. “It’s just a dream,” I muttered to myself, repeating Mom’s words as if they would make me believe them.

Taking a deep breath, I stepped closer and removed the lid. It hit the ground with a dull thud. Darkness stared back at me. My hands trembled as I grabbed the rope attached to the pulley. Slowly, I began lowering the bucket into the well. The rhythmic squeaking of the pulley echoed in my ears, mimicking the whispers from my dreams: “Sue, Sue, Sue.”

Lost in my thoughts, I didn’t realize the bucket had hit the bottom until the rope slipped from my hands. The splash at the bottom snapped me back to reality.

“Oh no,” I muttered, panic setting in. Mom was going to kill me if I didn’t get that bucket back. I ran to the barn and grabbed a rake and a spare rope, fashioning a makeshift hook. Returning to the well, I lowered the rake and moved it side to side, hoping to catch the bucket.

When I finally pulled something up, relief washed over me—it was the bucket. But inside it was something else: a small rag doll, human-shaped but faceless.

“Lucky find,” I thought, wringing it out and tying it to the cord of my dress. With the bucket reattached to the pulley, I finished drawing water and carried it to the goats.

 

“Good afternoon, gentlemen,” I said to the pair of goats as I poured the water into their trough. They usually greeted me with calm bleats, but today, they backed away suddenly, their eyes fixed on the doll dangling from my dress. Their reaction sent a chill down my spine.

“I’d better get back to the house,” I decided, leaving the shed behind. Inside, I showed Mom the doll. “Look what I found near the well,” I lied. I didn’t want to tell her the truth.

“That’s nice, honey,” she said with a smile. “Maybe it’ll help you sleep better. It’ll keep you company at night.”

“I hope so,” I replied, setting the doll by my bed before lying down for a nap

Night came, and the dream returned. I was back at the well, the house behind me dark and silent. This time, the voice wasn’t a whisper—it was clear, loud, and strangely familiar.

“Sue, Sue, Sue,” it called.

I wasn’t frozen this time. Instead, I felt drawn to the well, as if I had to find out what was calling me. Step by step, I approached the edge and peered into the darkness.

“What?” I asked.

“Thank you for freeing me.”

I jolted awake, my heart racing. The room was silent, save for the distant hoot of an owl. I glanced at the spot where I’d left the doll, but it was gone.

“Mom must’ve taken it like she always does with my things,” I thought, irritated. I got up to check.

Knocking on my parents’ door, I waited for an answer, but none came. Pushing the door open, I saw Mom lying in bed. Beside her was the doll.

“I’m taking you back,” I whispered, stepping closer. That’s when I noticed the dark stain spreading across the blanket. Pulling it back, I froze. A knife was buried in her chest, blood pooling beneath her. The doll sat next to her, its blank face staring back at me.

“Thanks to you,” I whispered, a smile creeping onto my lips.
