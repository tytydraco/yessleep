Two sat in the front of the police cruiser: Deputy Harlow and myself. I was driving. In the back was the murderer.


It was my birthday and I had a fat steak waiting at home, but once the bastard behind me made a request I couldn’t ignore, I phoned my wife and told her I’d be late. Harlow called his son and told him he had to postpone their daily game of catch in the backyard. “All this sacrifice had better be worth it,” Harlow had told me before we removed the prisoner from the jail cell.


To be honest, I wondered the same thing.


Then the three of us were in the cruiser making our way down the county roads and into the rural woodlands outside our quaint small town. Logging roads popped up here and there, along with a few random scatterings of litter tossed aside by hunters or hiking tourists. The occasional car zipped by going the opposite direction. Soon, all manner of human occupation ceased. Most people didn’t venture this far into the wilderness unless they were lost. All that remained was the winding road and the fertile green woods.


“Keep going around this bend,” the murderer said. “About a mile more, maybe.”


Deputy Harlow scratched the back of his head and turned around, his nose only an inch away from the clear safety partition that divided the front seats from the back. He eyed our prisoner suspiciously. “About a mile or more? Maybe? You don’t sound very confident, Winston.”


“I told you, Officer Harlow,” he hissed. “*Winston* is no longer my name. I’ve been given a new name and The Empress promised me once I ascend into the heavens beyond the universe that my name will be heralded-”


“Shut the fuck up, psycho. We aren’t here to listen to your insane ravings. We’re here for one reason and one reason only.”


Winston grew quiet and calmly looked out the window as hills of trees rolled by.


Harlow continued, “You told Sheriff Brewer and myself that you were ready to lead us to the spot. Before we call the FBI and turn this endeavor into a media circus, we need to know that you’re not pulling our leg.”


Winston smiled. “It would be an embarrassment for you to call everyone only to have my admittances be a fraud.”


I agreed. “Yes,” I said. “That’s correct. To make this process easier, you will show the both of us where you buried them, then the plea bargain will go into effect if we find them. Found bodies equal a removal of the death penalty.”


Winston turned his eyes to the sky. “There is no death with the Empress. No death. Only abundance.”


Harlow and I traded glances. What Winston Abner was going on about was nothing we hadn’t heard before—the man had spouted random gibberish constantly since his arrest last August. Everyone was tired of it. So much in fact that his last cellmate gave him the scar that now ran along his left eyebrow.


Of course, that altercation didn’t shut him up and he kept going on. Phrases about an eerie afterlife and ethereal happiness. Ramblings about female royalty and infinite knowledge. The ravings of a mad man for sure. Since our county only had a population of about twenty-five thousand, our options for a professional were limited. We had to hire a psychologist from the city to administer a psych evaluation after his arrest.


The results were as you would expect from a man who had kidnapped seven children and blamed his actions on some unseen maleficent force. Winston Abner was as violently insane as they come.


“That’s it,” he said.


“Where?”


“There, there. Turn left.”


A small opening among the weeds and brush off the shoulder of the road was all there was to indicate the correct turn. The path was little more than a deer trail. The police cruiser’s tires crunched off the gravel then found the dirt path. Branches scraped the windows and doors and the eerie sounds made my breath hitch. We had three hours until dusk but I knew we would be out of the woods long before then.


I didn’t know that Winston had other plans.


The cruiser trundled along over the rutted rudimentary path. I did my best to avoid the branches and potholes but grass covered much of my view. We all bounced and swayed to the tune of the wilderness that had overtaken the extinct logging route. The trees in the area were stunted compared to trees a mile back, but they were at least half a century old. Whatever logging expedition occurred here had happened when I was in diapers.


“Where the hell are you taking us?” Harlow asked, giving Winston an acidic glare.


“To the beginning,” Winston said.


“The beginning of what?”


“Of my rebirth.”


Harlow rolled his eyes. “If this is your idea of a joke I’m going to pull you out of the car and beat you senseless.”


I cut my eyes. “Deputy.”


“What? I don’t want to go on some wild goose chase. I’m missing time with my son for this. It better be worth it.”


“It will be,” Winston whispered.


The old trail split into a “Y” shape and Winston instructed me to take the left route. The car rolled along between a stand of oaks that were much older than the surrounding pines. Gnarled limbs snaked around themselves. The bark was dark, almost appearing burned. 


I kept my guard up. 


Winston—although mentally ill and delusional—was still a crafty son of a bitch. Just because he had been in solitary confinement for a month didn’t mean he hadn’t snuck out instructions to an accomplice to meet us here. Stuff like that happened in prisons all the time. An ambush wasn’t likely, but possible. Harlow had the same idea. Our eyes were peeled as we searched the surrounding woods for movement. We took note of the weight of the pistols in our holsters.


“We’re close. I can sense them.”


Harlow spun around. “Sense who?”


“The children.”


I regarded Harlow and he started chewing his bottom lip. It was a nervous habit he’d had since he was a rookie. The idea that Winston was reliving his evil deed, the deed that snuffed out the lives of seven children, boiled my blood. We were out in the middle of nowhere and a good thrashing might drill some regret into this murderer. But that would create a host of new problems. Then Harlow and I would be locked up right next to Winston.


I remembered when the first child went missing. It was big news in our little town. Then another abduction happened. And another. Over the course of a week seven children went missing and as acting sheriff it was my job to find them. There were countless interviews and search parties. Nothing of substance was gained.


When the FBI got involved we had hoped that their superior resources would flip the tragedy into a happy ending. The kids would be found and the perpetrator would be brought to justice. Only one of those things happened. We found Winston on video near the sight of where one of the abductions took place and traced him to a deserted house on the outskirts of our town. He admitted to taking the children but said no more. The bodies of the victims were never found.


“Stop,” Winston yelled.


I slammed on the brakes and turned around. “Here? Did you bury them here?”


The crazy son of a bitch closed his eyes and leaned his head back like he was having an orgasm. He gently smacked his lips like he was . . . savoring something. “Yes, Sheriff Brewer. They are close. We must continue on foot.”


I removed Winston from the back seat and helped him stay balanced. It was difficult to stand (much less walk) with handcuffs and ankle cuffs resisting your every movement. I put my hand on Winston’s shoulder and told him to lead Deputy Harlow and myself to the burial sight.


I didn’t have much faith this trek would produce anything substantial. If this ended up being some fabrication just so Winston could get out of his cell for a little while I didn’t put it past Harlow to punch him in the head once or twice. It’s not like the bastard wouldn’t deserve it.


He began to walk east, each baby step rattling with the weight of the chains, while Harlow grabbed a shovel out of the cruiser’s trunk. We would have to see actual proof of the bodies before we made the call to the federal government. That meant digging. It was something neither of us wanted to do but if we found something that would give closure to the victim’s families then it would be worth the heartbreaking activity.


We didn’t walk far before we saw something. 


Seven cairns formed a circle inside a glade where all the dead leaves and sticks had been brushed away. Logs had been placed in a disorderly fashion and collections of twigs wrapped with grass hung on low branches. The scene made my skin crawl. It was eerie to see this so far from any civilization but it was evidence that someone had been here. Harlow and I knew who that someone was.


“Is this your camp, Winston?” I asked.


“Sheriff?” Harlow said timidly while scanning the area. “Look at that.”


I glanced around the area too and noticed what Harlow was worried about. All the trees were marked with odd symbols. Seven rings had been carved into the bark and a thick line was cut right down the middle of them. The symbol wasn’t just on the trees adjacent to us - it was carved on every tree in our line of sight. Hundreds of them. Maybe a thousand.


One man couldn’t do this.


Harlow dropped his hand to his holster. “Think it’s a trap, sheriff?”


I grabbed Winston by the collar and got an inch from his face. “Are other people out here? What is this place?”


His eyes turned to the sky and a mischievous grin spread over his face. “Only the chosen are here. This is the place of my rebirth. My home.”


“Sheriff!” Harlow shouted and drew his pistol. “I saw movement. We aren’t alone.”


I shoved Winston to the ground and removed my pistol. If this was an ambush attempt the assailants would have to do so while dodging my .45 caliber rounds. I scanned the trees, keeping my eyes peeled for the movement Harlow witnessed. Wiry tree limbs wobbled in the breeze. Dried leaves skittered across the wooded area. Above, clouds lazily floated away. A mockingbird flew overhead then turned around and headed back from which it came.


“I don’t see anyone, deputy,” I called out.


“There!”


I followed his gaze but I didn’t see anything.


Harlow aimed his pistol. “And there! Halt! Police! Don’t fucking move.”


I kept rotating around in my shooter’s stand to keep a 360 degree view of our surroundings. I refused to be caught off guard. I kept watching and darting my eyes around to see what I could find. I noticed nothing new. There were the swaying tree branches, tumbling dried leaves, lazy clouds, a kid, a few birds-


A kid?


I re-scanned the area but there wasn’t a kid. I thought I saw some kind of movement, maybe a small hoodie ducking behind a tree, or a small leg in jeans sliding behind a fallen log. But I was mistaken. There was nothing there.


“Do you see them?” Harlow called out in a panic. “They are fucking everywhere.”


“I don’t see anything,” I said without much conviction. “I’m calling off this little expedition. We’re done. Let’s take Winston back.”


I stepped toward Winston and started to lift him but noticed he was crying. No, not crying. Sobbing. He was on his knees and his shackled hands were raised as high as the chains allowed in a posture of subservience. His head tilted back and his eyes were cast up like he was looking at something right in front of him. An expression of extreme dismay and concern washed over his face.


“I beg you, Empress. I beg you.” He was mumbling the words over and over as he fought the emotional fit he was under. Snot and tears ran over his thin lips. His chest rocked with each sobbing breath.


“Get up,” Harlow shouted. “We’re taking you back.”


“I beg you. Please, spare me. I am your servant for eternity.” He bent his head so low it touched the ground. “Spare me from your wrath, I beg you.” He raised up and stared at the nothing in front of him.


Then he stopped crying. He went silent. As a matter of fact, everything went silent. The wind ceased. Branches no longer tickled one another. Leaves remained stationary. No birds flew. Even the clouds halted.


I followed Winston’s gaze. The spot at which he stared was absent of anything tangible. No one stood there. Nothing was nearby. No tree or cairn or log. Winston was merely prostrating at something that was only in his imagination-


“Aaarrrgh!”


Our prisoner let out a horrifying scream. He tumbled on his face and tried to take some kind of defensive position but the shackles held firm. The tendons on his neck grew taut as he wailed like he was in indescribable pain. But again . . . nothing was there. Nothing was hurting him.


Then I saw the blood.


His aching cries soared into the air while he wrestled around on the ground. His legs churned and his back arched. Then his eyes began to bleed. His irises tinted red then streams of fresh blood trickled down his cheeks. His inhalations grew labored and harsh. His chest heaved like something was plunging inside it. Harlow and I stared at one another, having no idea what to do.


Then Harlow’s expression changed from confusion to sheer terror. He didn’t have to point. He didn’t have to say a word. Because when I turned around I saw them too.


Children. Children everywhere.


They were peeking from behind the same trees that were carved with symbols. Soft cute faces stared in subtle curiosity at the man writhing before us. Children that ranged in ages from preteens to toddlers and wearing all manners of clothes, some of which seemed more in tune with what people wore in the eighteenth century. Hundreds of them, bashfully watching from the safety of their wooden refuge. Watching as Winston was dying in an agonizing way. They hid half their bodies from our view like they were watching something that they knew could get them in trouble. But in trouble with whom?


“What the fuck is going on?” Harlow shouted over our prisoner’s screams. “Where did all these kids come from?”


Then I saw them. Familiar faces.


“It’s them,” I said and pointed. Harlow saw them immediately.


The missing children from our town. They were among the children behind the trees. That’s when I knew that what we were dealing with was far beyond our comprehension. Too bad I didn’t grab Harlow right then and there and fled.


I decided to be a hero.


“I’ll get the missing kids and see what’s going on. Stay with Winston.”


Winston gurgled something but it was indecipherable through the hoarse screams. Harlow bent down and did his best at keeping Winston still.


In the meantime, I sprinted through the woods toward the children. Not only was I going to save the seven from our town, but I was going to save them all. One call and this forest would be flooded with FBI agents. Parents would be reunited with their children. The mysteries would be solved. I’d go down as the best fucking sheriff in America.


But when I got close to a tree the corresponding child would duck behind it like they were frightened of me. One time I circled a tree that a second before had hid a little girl in a gown and stockings. A bonnet sat on her head and I followed the bonnet around the tree. Then there was nothing. She was gone. 


I chased toward the familiar children I knew, calling to them and reminding them that I was the sheriff. I instructed them to not move and called out to them that their parents were going to be so happy to see them, but it was the same as before. Each tree I reached held nothing behind it. It was as if they vanished like a vapor. The seven children I’d found were lost again.


In the distance I saw other children watching me. Their faces a brief comfort in the woods darkened by the dying light. I didn’t know what was going on so I returned to my deputy and my prisoner.


Winston lay still. Runnels of blood covered his face and soaked into the collar of his shirt. Harlow sat next to him and busied his hands with something.


“Is he dead?” I asked.


Harlow’s hands stopped and he got to his feet. “Yeah. He’s dead. He stopped squirming after you left.”


“I couldn’t get the kids. They . . . they kept moving.” I wasn’t able to say the word *disappeared*. It was too nonsensical. No one just disappears.


Harlow nodded. “If they’ve survived this long then they can survive a little while longer. We need to leave.”


I felt for a pulse on Winston’s neck but there was none. “Shit. This has turned into a complete clusterfuck.”


Harlow put a hand on my shoulder. He felt cold. Which was not a surprise. My nerves were completely shot by then and my legs were sore from running. The setting sun had cooled off the woods more than I’d realized.


“We need to leave,” he said. “Leave Winston here and we can come back later.”


“Good idea. We can get reinforcements. No one is going to believe us though.” I fought off tears. “We’ll come back tonight.”


I shouted into the woods for the children to hear. “We’ll come back tonight with a search party. Don’t leave.”


I waited for Harlow to add something but by the time my patience wore thin I saw that he’d already headed back toward the cruiser. I stood up and followed, turning around one last time to see if there was something I’d missed. The only thing I saw was a small group of rocks that Harlow had stacked while he’d been waiting on me.


My walk to the cruiser was slower than Harlow’s but I knew he would be on the radio, telling dispatch about our predicament. However, I got lost. The spot where I thought the car was parked was nothing but dead sticks and leaves. The sun had almost set and it was difficult to get my bearings straight. Then my shoe landed on something in the mud.


Tire tracks.


Harlow had driven off without me.


“Harlow? Harlow, where are you?” I called him from my personal radio but the static was so intense that I wasn’t sure it connected. Then, from behind the static, I heard his voice.


“*Harlow* is no longer my name. I’ve been given a new name . . . by The Empress.”


The line went dead. I made several attempts to call him back or to call dispatch but nothing went through. I was stuck in the woods . . . at night . . . alone.


It’s now 2 a.m. as I’m writing this on my phone. No texts will go through. No calls. My cell service is completely gone. I’m going to attempt to post this in the hopes someone will see it and tell the truth about what happened. 


I can’t die here. Today is my birthday. I pray I get to see my wife and kids again.


I think I’ve been walking in the right direction. If I can find the gravel road then maybe a driver will spot me.


No sooner had I typed that did I find a familiar sight: the trees with symbols. I’d made a giant circle. I’m back in the glade. Only this time something is different. I used my phone light to inspect Winston but his body was no longer on the ground. It had been hoisted into a tree twenty feet above me.


Something had been eating him. All his limbs were now bloody stumps and his stomach was now a gory hole.


But the strangest part is that behind one of the trees with symbols I swear I can see Winston staring at me.
