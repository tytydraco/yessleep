 probably start by saying this wasn’t a dream. At least, it didn’t feel like one. It happened when I was wide awake, in the middle of the day, sitting at my kitchen table.

I had my old Bible in front of me. The pages were worn thin, and I was turning through them slowly, half reading, half trying to steady myself. I’d been fighting off a fever all morning, but for some reason I felt like I needed to read. Maybe I thought the words would calm me, or maybe it was just a distraction.

That’s when I felt it. A sudden wave of dizziness rolled over me, the kind that makes your stomach flip and your vision tilt. My hands trembled on the table. My heart began to race like something terrible was about to happen.

And then… dust.

It drifted down from the ceiling, tiny gray flecks catching the light. At first, I thought the wood beams above me were just old, maybe crumbling. But the dust didn’t stop. It seemed endless, as though something was shaking the house from above.

I tilted my head back to see.

And that’s when I heard it.

The scream.

It wasn’t just loud. It was piercing, like it was made of metal and glass all at once. A young girl’s voice, shrill with terror, ripped through the ceiling, so close it felt like she was right above me — maybe even inside the house.

I froze. My breath caught in my throat, and every muscle in my body locked tight. For a second, I thought the ceiling would split open and whatever was screaming would fall straight through into the kitchen with me.

But it didn’t. The scream ended as suddenly as it began, leaving only silence — silence so complete that I could hear the blood rushing in my ears.

I pushed back from the table, my chair scraping loud against the floor. My legs were unsteady, weak, but I forced myself toward the door. I had to get out. I had to breathe.

The moment I stepped into the doorway, something changed.

It’s hard to describe. The air itself felt wrong, heavy and vibrating, as if the world had shifted out of alignment. And when I walked through the threshold of my house, it wasn’t the front yard that greeted me.

It was something else.

The sunlight was gone, replaced by a dark, endless expanse. My home still stood behind me, but it looked pale, faded, as though it was a memory rather than a real place. The ground beneath my feet stretched into a shadowy plain, featureless except for distant shapes that seemed to shift when I tried to focus on them.

It was an alternate dimension. I don’t know how else to explain it. It felt like it coexisted with our world, overlapping in places, hidden until you stumbled into it by accident.

I remember clutching the doorframe behind me, afraid that if I let go I’d lose my way back forever. My chest tightened, and I could barely breathe. My mind screamed at me to step back inside, to shut the door, but another part of me couldn’t stop staring into the dark expanse ahead.

And I swear — in the distance — something moved.

That’s when the dizziness returned, harder this time, and I stumbled back into my kitchen. My house was normal again. The air was still. The Bible still lay open on the table.

I don’t know what happened. Maybe it was a fever hallucination. Maybe not. But I haven’t opened that Bible since.
