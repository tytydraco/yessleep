As a teenager, I stayed up late the night of hurricane Harvey. Our family called it "flood watch", but we all knew I loved an excuse to stay up all night playing fallout four. I was probably three hours in, been sitting in the dark staring at a screen so long with it muted I was starting to get bored. So I got up, turned on some lights, checked on the pets, stealing Dad's sodas, usual responsible teenager stuff.

 The storm was screaming outside. I kept hearing this screeching from the wind in our garage all night, but every now there was something else. I'd hear our staircase that went up to this overlook to the living room shaking like someone we're running up or down them but on tiptoes I figured that was just the thunder shaking stuff up and took a second to go through the house. 

After about an hour and a half of lights on I was ready to delve back into my game. Lights freshly off, game still paused I sat down. While I was staring at the screen , in the corner of my eye at the top of the stairs I saw a woman. My mom was asleep and my little sister was like six, this was a woman. Long white dress, but her face and hair just ... blended into the dark.i could just barely distinguish a face, just not make details. I didn't react. I didn't start the game, I didn't move, I did not stare back at her like I could feel she was glaring at me. After probably 30 seconds she just, fully faded into the dark. I saw as her dress, her arms faded back. She didn't step back or disappear instantly. It was like she glided into nothing. I stayed there trying to rationalize what I saw. You would always hear someone walking upstairs, but I didn't hear her. 

The rumbling of the stairs didn't happen again, but I kept hearing thunder. I couldn't go up there after that, I couldn't wake anyone up because I "thought" I saw a woman. I turned off my game, put on some YouTube and eventually felt confident enough to turn on the lights. There was nothing at the top of the stairs I could have misconstrued. Brothers door in front of the stairs was closed, couldn't of been him, I'd hear the door open at some point. I just kept running through my head again and again trying to convince myself I saw nothing. I forgot to even keep checking for flooding but we were luckier than some neighbors. 

The next morning, my parents and I surveyed the damage to the area. I didn't mention the phantom woman, I just wanted to forget it. Something about how she stared at me, was she watching me before and I just didn't notice in three hours because I was mindlessly building settlements and running the minutemen?

Over the rest of my high school up until I graduated and moved for college, my family always told me about weird stuff that happened to them. Some accounts were hearing family members that werent home talking in other rooms. Another account being a remote flying from my mom's night stand across the room while two of my brothers were talking to her at the foot of her bed and she was in a chair near them. I was never there. I remember at this time my parents started fighting more, my siblings got really aggressive with bullying one another. Tensions were always high and I just wanted out. I was always in a fowl mood, I couldn't stand when my family looked at me.

I moved as soon as I could, as far as I could from Texas to New York. I had a lot of new opportunities I was happier, but over time my mood caught back up with me. I was so depressed, angry and I couldn't place why. I just wanted to go back to a place I had hated a few years before. Before COVID hit New York my mom got sick. She needed help with my youngest siblings and my dad was working as many hours as possible. I had a reason to move back, and I missed them. I put college on hold and moved back as soon as possible. 

After a week back, I had been hit with story after story of weird stuff that happened while I was gone. I never stayed up passed midnight at this point, I always felt ready to sleep after a lifetime of being a night owl. I hadn't thought of that woman in years but all these stories made me consider my secret one encounter with her. One night, I had a dream.

The dream was strange. It was in a jumbled concoction of every place I've lived at, furniture and hallways leading into the bedrooms of another home. I was talking to my youngest siblings, my sister and her twin brother. They were older, young adults really. I don't remember what we were talking about about, maybe something mundane. I felt like I belonged. Suddenly my sister screamed and in the room with us was that woman who stared at me. The lights kept turning off and she just stared at me. I remember the lights turning off fully and her face, nearly featureless emanating a bright red light. she slowly raised in the dark, I could hear her bones snapping, every agonizing twist and snap and all at once the lights turned on again. She stayed in the light. She was crying. My siblings ran to check on her, she was just a normal woman in a white dress. I saw in the wall behind them a hole blaring that same red light. All I could think was I had to cover it. I saw tape nearby and covered it with the whole roll. When I looked back at the twins with the woman, I felt so proud of them. Then I woke up. 

I felt genuinely happy. I felt closure, I don't know what else it could have been. I never mentioned the dream to anyone either. I kept asking if the family had anymore events happen but nothing. My siblings got along better, my mom got better soon after then her and my dad stopped fighting. My dad's long hours managed to get us a better home after a little while. My mom says every now and then that shes surprised I started to keep eye contact with people when we speak. Often late at night though, I just find myself staring, doesn't matter at what or who. I just want to stare and admire something.
