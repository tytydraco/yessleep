Some secrets don’t stay buried.
At the Ironwood Asylum, one of them still breathes. --

Rain lashed against the grimy apartment windows, streaking the glass with silvery tears. Inside, a small boy knelt on the floor, clutching a threadbare blanket to his face. The fabric smelled faintly of lavender and soap. He pressed it as close as he could, as if it could somehow bring her back.

His mother was gone. The way his small mind could barely comprehend the sight of her lifeless body, and how the world had moved on, leaving only the echo of her voice in his ears and the hollow ache in his chest.

A knock at the door startled him, but he didn’t move. The social worker’s gentle voice called through.

“Elliot, honey… we need to take you somewhere safe.”

Somewhere safe. The words felt empty. He shook his head, burying it deeper in the blanket, inhaling her scent once again.

From behind her, two men in black coats waited. One of them stepped forward to reach for him, and he flinched.

“You can take it with you,” the man spoke.

Elliot didn’t speak. He only nodded, clinging tighter to the blanket as he was guided out the door and into the back of a police car. 

The drive was silent. Rain pounded on the car roof, both men looking back into the rearview mirror to see the boy's distant expression. When they arrived at the  imposing house of his father, Elliot’s stomach twisted. The man who had abandoned him now stood waiting.

“Elliot,” his father said, voice distant. “Come inside.”

The boy didn’t respond. He clutched the blanket to his chest, imagining his mother’s hand in the folds. Soon the door closed behind them with a hollow click. The boy’s lips pressed into the fabric. He whispered like a desperate promise.

“I’ll never forget you.”

The house was vast, orderly, and painfully quiet. Definitely not a child’s comfort. A faint scent of disinfectant lingered in the air, replacing the lingering lavender of his mother’s apartment.

His father’s gaze was sharp and calculating, as he led Elliot down a narrow hallway. “This will be your room,” he said, his voice flat, pointing toward a small door at the end of the hall. “ Go Unpack and stay put.”

Elliot hesitated. The room was clean, neat, almost pristine, but it felt like a cage. The blanket against his chest was the only thing that smelled like home. He hugged it close, as if it could shield him from the foreign walls and the stranger who claimed to be his father.

“You’ll sleep here,” the man continued. “I expect… order. No crying, and no noise. I have work to attend to.”

Elliot’s small hands tightened around the blanket. He simply nodded, retreating into the corner of the room. 

When the father left, the door clicked behind him, leaving Elliot in the quiet. The boy pressed his back against the wall. He imagined his mother’s face over the folds of fabric, remembering the gentle hum she would sing when tucking him in, pulling him into a much needed slumber. 

The next morning, the boy’s father led him down a wide corridor lined with polished floors and a strong antiseptic scent that seemed to cling to everything in the asylum. Elliot’s small fingers clutched the blanket. 

At the end of the hallway, a woman waited. She was dressed simply, her coat neatly buttoned, and her eyes carried a soft warmth.

“This is Nurse Maren,” his father said. “She will be responsible for your care here. You will listen to her.”

The nurse stepped forward slowly, crouching so her face was closer to his level. “Hello, Elliot,” she said gently. “I’ve heard a lot about you and have worked alongside your father for years now.. I promise I’ll take good care of you.”

Elliot stared at her, unsure. Her voice was calm, soothing, almost like a lullaby, but he didn’t trust it yet. No one could replace the warmth he had lost. 

“May I see your room?” she asked softly, gesturing toward the end of the hall.

Elliot nodded slowly, still wary. She offered him her hand, and after a long pause, he placed his small fingers in hers. Her touch was gentle, and for a brief moment, he felt safe, not like his mother, but a promise of stability. 

As they walked, she kept her tone soft, humming quietly under her breath, a tune that reminded him of the lullabies his mother used to sing. Elliot pressed the blanket against his face, closing his eyes, letting the faint warmth of her voice wrap around him.

When they reached his room, Nurse Maren knelt beside him, smoothing the bedcovers. “This is your space now,” she said. “You can keep your blanket here."

Elliot nodded again, feeling the weight of the asylum press against him. The room was neat, tidy, and cold, but for the first time since his mother’s death, he felt a spark of comfort, a fragile thread he could cling to.

And somewhere, in the groans and moans  of the halls, something watched him.

Nurse Maren didn’t notice it. She only smiled softly and said,

“We’ll take care of each other, Elliot. I promise.”

The next day, Nurse Maren led Elliot through the winding halls of the father’s asylum. Though he wouldn’t yet know to call it that. To him, it still felt like a house, a cold, towering one.

“This way,” she said softly, her hand lightly on his back. “There’s a lot to see, but I’ll be with you the whole time.”

As they turned a corner, they came to a double sided row of metal cell doors, much like a prison. Through them, Elliot could see people moving. Figures crouched, shuffled, or pressed against the walls. Their eyes were wide, hollow, and unblinking. Some whimpered; others muttered words he didn’t understand.

“Who… who are they?” he asked.

“These are patients,” Nurse Maren said carefully, kneeling beside him so her face was level with his. “Some of them are sick. Some… are a bit more fortunate. But they’re under care. Always under care.”

Elliot felt a shiver run down his spine. The figures behind the bars stared at him in silence, some tilting their heads in ways that felt unnatural. One pressed a pale, trembling hand through the bars. Elliot instinctively recoiled. 

“They won’t hurt you,” Nurse Maren said softly. “They’re… different, but they’re not your concern. You just need to stay close to me.”

The boy peeked out from behind the nurse. The figures weren’t like the children he remembered from school or the neighbors he had seen outside. Their movements were jerky, and uneven, as if their bodies didn’t quite belong to them. Some were animalistic in their gestures, scratching, crouching, or twitching.

“Why do they look like that?” he whispered.

“Some are harder to treat..” Nurse Maren said gently, her eyes flicking toward one of the cells with a faint tension. “Not everyone is lucky. Some… don’t get better the way we  hope to achieve.."

“But you… you’ll take care of me?” he asked, voice shaking.

“Yes,” she said firmly. “I’ll keep you safe. I promise.”

-time skip-
Later throughout the week Elliot sat on the edge of his small bed, clutching the blanket close to his chest. The day had been long, filled with strange corridors, flickering lights, and the haunting figures behind the metal bars. Nurse Maren had tried to reassure him, but nothing helped. 

A sharp knock on the door made him jump. His father’s tall, imposing silhouette filled the doorway. His expression was hard, and cold.

“Elliot,” he said “That blanket… it’s not suitable here. You don’t need it.”

The boy froze. “I… I need it,” he whispered, clutching the fabric tighter. “It’s… it’s Mom.”

His father’s eyes narrowed. “Your mother is gone. You’re here now. That blanket… it keeps you from accepting reality. Give it to me.”

“No!” Elliot’s voice cracked. “Please… it’s all I have!”

Without another word, his father stepped forward and ripped the blanket from his small hands. Elliot fell back against the bed, staring at the fabric as it was pulled away. The scent of lavender, the only piece of his mother left, now faded as his father carried it out of the room.

Tears streamed down the boy’s face. He pressed his face into the cold mattress, his body shaking with grief. For the first time since the murder, he felt utterly alone.

Nurse Maren stepped forward hesitantly after his father left, placing a hand gently on his shoulder. “It’s still yours, Elliot,” she murmured. “It’s just… being kept safe for now.”

But he didn’t believe her. The warmth, the memory, the connection to his mother, it was now gone. He curled up on the bed, hugging himself, imagining his mother’s arms from the folds of the vanished blanket. And deep inside, a new sensation began to stir.

In the silence of the room, the shadows of the asylum seemed to lean closer, as if the walls were listening.

Days passed in a blur of cold routines and empty halls. Nurse Maren stayed close, offering gentle words, and soft smiles, but Elliot’s heart was no longer capable of accepting them. The blanket was gone, and with it, the last fragment of warmth from himself. Every word of reassurance felt like a lie. He watched her from the corners of the hallways, feeling the subtle shift in his stomach from anger, and betrayal. She was kind, yes, but she wasn’t her. 

His father’s presence only deepened the bitterness. The man was cold, and distant towards him and Elliot could feel the judgment in his gaze every time he faltered.

“Control yourself.”
“Stop clinging to the past.”

Words felt like knives, and the boy grew more resentful. 

In the quiet corners of the asylum, he began experimenting with small things: pressing lightly against doors to see how much pressure they could bear, moving silently across the polished floors, holding his breath and listening to the hum of the vents. Every day, he grew bolder. Each day, the shadow of anger and cunning inside him stretched, testing its limits.

And the more he explored, the more the resentment toward Nurse Maren and his father deepened. They wanted to guide him, to keep him “safe” but all he felt was trapped. One evening, as the rain pounded again against the windows, Elliot stopped outside a row of cell doors. The figures inside pressed against the bars, some with jerky animalistic movements. He could hear faint muttering, whispered words that bounced off the walls. 

He pressed a hand against the cold metal. “They’re like me,” he whispered to himself.

“I won’t be trapped anymore,” he murmured, “No one will trap me again.” And in the shadowed halls of the asylum, the boy began to understand that the world wasn’t going to give him what he wanted. He would have to take it.

One night, Elliot stayed in the shadows of a hallway, just beyond the corner of his room, listening to the soft patter of rain against the windows, and the distant murmur of voices.

His father’s deep tone echoed first in a hushed tone. 

“We’re running out of viable subjects.. The last batch… they’ve all failed. They’re… unstable, uncontrollable.. useless.”

A soft sigh followed. Nurse Maren replied, “We can’t push the next one too soon. Another failure will draw attention. We’ve already skirted too close with the authorities.”

“Attention won’t matter if we don’t get results,” he murmured. “We need more income. More funding. The project… it needs to succeed, Maren. And if we don’t have a suitable subject soon…” His words trailed off.

Elliot listened in from the ventilation system. His small body shook with confusion.

His father’s obsession, the nurse’s compliance, the cold, calculated cruelty, it all boiled in his young mind. He realized that no one would protect him, that the world he was in was a cage lined with people who only cared about results, not him personally. Elliot’s eyes burned in the dim light, his hands clinched.

“If they want someone useful… I’ll be what they need. If it gets us all out.."

He backed silently into the corner, watching his father and Nurse Maren walk past, Elliot realized that he could free himself and the others if he stayed strong.

"If I let them experiment on me… if I give them what they want… I can become the one they fear… the one they need… and then I can get us all out.."

He pictured his father, approval had always been so rare. But if he played into the project, if he allowed himself to be tested, maybe, just maybe.. his father would see him.

He whispered to the dark. "I’ll be in control."

The thought comforted him. It gave him purpose.

"They think they’re teaching me… but I’ll be teaching them. I’ll show them what it means to survive… to be strong… to be free."

A quiet, calculating calm settled over him. The grief and anger were still there, sharp and raw, but now they were fueled by determination. 

In the dark, Elliot made a promise to himself:

"I will become what they want… so I can become what I choose."

After a month of adapting to his surroundings The asylum whispered secrets, they always had and tonight they spoke in his father’s voice.

He crouched behind the half-open door of the laboratory, hidden in the shadows as the dim light cast a sickly glow over the room. Beakers steamed on the counter, the air sharp with antiseptic and the faint scent of blood.

His father stood over a table littered with notes and glass jars. A few contained organs that twitched faintly, even outside the body. Others held translucent vials of green liquid that were faintly pulsing.

Nurse Maren hovered nearby, her expression uneasy.

“You’re blending human and reptilian sequences again,” she said quietly. “The last batch lost motor control. Their tissue didn’t stop regenerating, it kept growing.”

His father’s tone was detached. “Regeneration isn’t a failure. It’s an evolution. Lizards can shed their tails and regrow them at will, why shouldn’t we extend that to human tissue? Controlled rejuvenation means no decay, and no death.”

He scribbled notes furiously, the quill scratching the paper “But the issue isn’t growth, it’s the direction. That’s where the canine strand comes in.”

Maren frowned. “The sensory enhancement?”

“Yes. Precision.” His father’s voice hardened, feverish. “Canines have an olfactory sense thousands of times sharper than ours. Acute hearing, instinctive coordination. Imagine pairing that awareness with the regenerative capability of reptilian DNA. It’s the next step of human adaptability!”

Elliot’s breath caught in his throat. He didn’t understand, but the words reptile and canine stuck in his head, it was strange.

His father continued, his voice fervent.

“The adhesive proteins in reptilian dermis.. if we can replicate the secretion, we can enhance surface traction. Vertical mobility, even wall crawling stability. Combine that with heightened senses and regenerating cells…”

Maren cut in softly. “You’d be creating something that isn’t human.”

There was a long silence. Then his father smiled faintly. “Humanity is the limitation, Maren.”

Elliot pressed his hand against the floor, staring at his reflection in a glass shard nearby. His eyes looked different in the light pale, almost luminous. The thought filled him with both fear and something else.. curiosity. He wanted to be strong. To be seen.
And his father was creating the path.

Maren hesitated. “And the subject?”

His father’s eyes flicked toward the observation window, the small room Elliot knew too well. “We’ll start with a willing one this time,” he said. “A child is adaptive, resilient. And this one… he has motivation. Loss breeds potential.”

The father’s pen scrawled the name "Project Nightcrawler" across the top of the document. He simply smiled.

"Now.. let's get to work."

The laboratory was colder than the rest of the house, sterile lights casting harsh shadows on the walls. Glass vials rattled faintly on the shelves as Elliot sat restrained on the narrow table. His small frame was tense, fists gripping the edges.

His father hovered above, syringes filled with viscous liquid glinting in the light.

“Tonight, we begin,” he said softly, almost clinical. “Step one: reptilian tissue regeneration. Step two: canine sensory augmentation.”

Elliot didn’t speak. He only stared at the table, jaw tight. Inside he was full of rage, and calculated determination. He would endure this. He would become what they wanted, so he could control what came next.

The first needle pierced his arm. A sharp burn, then a creeping warmth spreading through his veins. The father’s hands were steady, and precise documenting every injection in a leather-bound log:

DNA Strain R-17A: administered 3.2 ml  initial response normal. Slight cellular activity visible under a microscope. Vital signs are stable.

The second injection followed: a thick, almost oily liquid derived from canine neural and sensory genes. Elliot felt his ears prickle as if the room suddenly contained a thousand tiny buzzing fragments. The faint hum of the lights, the faint thump of his own pulse, even the shuffling of the nurse’s shoes seemed amplified.

DNA Strain C-22S: administered 4.8 ml auditory threshold increased. Olfactory neurons responding. Subject alert, aware, no signs of panic.

Elliot’s small body twitched involuntarily. He flexed his fingers, noticing a subtle sharpening in the muscles of his hands. He could sense the textures of the table beneath his palms, feeling the vibrations of the floorboards through the metal table.

His father noted every reaction meticulously:

Minute 17: slight hyper-awareness of surroundings. Subject tracking auditory and visual stimuli more efficiently. Motor reflexes increasing by 14%. No aggression has risen.

Hours passed in a rhythm of injection, observation, and note-taking. The room smelled faintly of ozone, mixed with the strange coppery scent of past stains.

Elliot’s body felt strange. Muscles coiled differently, joints bending with an unnatural fluidity. He tested some small movements, a flex of his legs. His finger nails grew more into a pointed edge barely scrapping the metal.

Minute 52: regenerative cells visible under dermal layers. Slight keratin growth observed on phalanges. The subject remains cooperative.

The boy’s ears twitched. He could hear the faintest vibrations in the lab. The buzzing of a light, the father scribbling notes, even the minuscule drip of liquid from a distant pipe.

Minute 76: subject demonstrates early proprioceptive enhancements. Sensory integration with vestibular and auditory systems progressing beyond expected parameters.

Elliot realized something, he was becoming stronger, faster, and sharper. Every injection, every note, every observation in the log was proof that the experiment worked.

"I will endure this. I will become more than them. and I will decide what freedom means."

By the time the injections ceased, and his father and nurse stepped back, Elliot’s small chest rose and fell rapidly. His eyes glowed faintly in the dim light, ears twitching toward every sound. The first stirrings of his tail twitched beneath the folds of his body. He flexed his fingers experimentally, feeling the keratin starting to form along his nails.

Project Nightcrawler is progressing ahead of schedule, his father noted, oblivious to the spark of awareness and cunning already blazing behind those glowing eyes.

Elliot didn’t speak. He didn’t have to. The boy who had once clung to a blanket, desperate for his mother’s warmth, had already begun becoming the predator he would one day be. Silv.

The leather bound book sat on the lab table, thick with months of meticulous notes. Each entry full of chronicled injections, measurements, observations, and the subtle changes that no one else had noticed.

Month 1:

DNA Strain R-17A / C-22S — administered daily. The subject remains cooperative. Mild increase in muscular flexibility observed. Minor keratin growth on phalanges. Auditory threshold increased by 12%. Subject alert, aware, no aggression. Emotional response: grief persists, focus heightened.

Month 2:

Reinforced injections of R-17A. Adhesive dermal secretion introduced in trace amounts. The subject demonstrates the early ability to adhere to smooth surfaces. Tail formation observed under the dermal layer, non-functional. Olfactory neurons responding at 18% increase. Subject shows signs of deliberate experimentation with movement.

Month 3:

Keratin growth progressing along digits. Tail now flexible, 2 cm in length, rudimentary musculature forming. Subject begins testing auditory and olfactory limits independently. Aggression remains controlled. Emotional manipulation suggested, potential to exploit grief and resentment as conditioning.

Month 4:

Subject demonstrates climbing capability on smooth walls up to 45° incline. Tail actively used for balance. Sensory acuity approaching canine thresholds. They are now increasingly independent; exploring limits of restraint during observations. Emotional state: distrust toward Nurse Maren and father noted; may be advantageous for project compliance via controlled incentive.

Month 5:

Tail fully formed, approximately 5ft long Adhesive dermal secretion functional for extended duration. Motor reflexes exceed expected thresholds by 23%. Auditory and olfactory senses near peak enhancement. Subject testing spatial awareness in new environments, curiosity and cunning markedly increased. Psychological assessment: developing strategic thought patterns.

Month 6:

*Full integration of R-17A and C-22S strands. Regenerative capacity confirmed—minor tail autonomy occurs when stressed, and regrows fully within 24 hours. Subject demonstrates stealth movement across floors and walls. Subtle claw elongation noted. Emotional response: deliberate compliance with observation, masking independent agenda. Subject shows clear understanding of reward and fear mechanisms, potential for controlled incentive.

Month 7:

Subject begins combining sensory input with motor output in complex navigation tasks. Tail is used for dynamic balancing, auditory and olfactory cues guiding decisions. Experiments on strength and endurance show above-expected performance. Strategic planning inferred, subject anticipates environmental variables and observing patterns.
