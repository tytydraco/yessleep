Stillwater, Pennsylvania. A town that reeked of rust, wet leaves, and something colder that clung to the bones. The past held tight like damp earth, impossible to shake. The Harvest Festival should've been a reprieve with the splash of cider-sweet cheer against the decaying edges of a fading town. Lanterns flickered on sagging cables strung across the square, casting nervous light over vendors selling roasted corn, cider, and bottles of bootleg moonshine.

Anthony Zane leaned against the warped railing near the stage, tapping a battered notebook against his palm. The empty pages stared back like an accusation. No words came.

Dark Americana, his editor had said. Someplace gritty, haunted—authentic.

Stillwater. A half-forgotten mining town with a history steeped in whispered stories, grim superstitions, and disappearances no one wanted to explain. He'd thought coming back to Stillwater would ignite something, pull stories from the bones of the town. He was wrong.

His gaze drifted toward the square's edge, where the path to the old mining museum loomed past the unkempt winding woods. The founder's statue stood at its entrance, a miner caught mid-swing, his pickaxe raised—not in triumph but in defense.

Defensive posture? Intended or incidental? He scrawled in the notebook, and his pen was finally moving.

"You still writing that damn book, Zane?" The familiar voice pulled him from his thoughts. He turned to see Josie Patterson, tucking her hair under a weathered baseball cap, her faded denim jacket worn thin at the seams. Something was grounding about seeing her. Steady. Reliable. Real.

Stillwater was all of that. A half-forgotten mining town with a history steeped in whispered stories, grim superstitions, and disappearances no one wanted to explain. He'd thought his hometown would be enough to spark something. He was wrong.

"Trying," he said. "Stillwater's tougher to figure out than I remembered."

Josie huffed a quiet laugh. "I figured you'd given up." She shifted her weight, arms crossed.  He could see the calluses on her hands from long nights working on her prized car and at the Rusty Pickaxe, her family's bar at the edge of town. She'd practically been born behind that counter, pouring drinks and breaking up fights before she could legally drink.

"Guess I'm more stubborn than you remember," he said lightly.

Her smirk softened just enough to show the faintest trace of something warmer. "You'd have to be coming back here."

Before he could respond, a sharp, shrill scream split the air—somewhere near the woods beyond the festival grounds. The wind held its breath as the music faltered, and conversations died. Anthony’s hand twitched toward his notebook. He went to speak, but for the first time in a long while, the words refused to come.

Anthony's gaze darted through the crowd and locked onto a familiar tweed jacket. Elijah Steward. Greyed but unmistakable, pushing toward the source of the scream.

Anthony looked upon his former professor's large frame and felt a strange mixture of relief and dread. Elijah Steward had always seemed larger than life—an academic fortress of occult knowledge wrapped in worn tweed and stubborn conviction. Seeing him charging toward the edge of the festival, shoulders squared and eyes blazing, reminded Anthony of how much Stillwater refused to stay buried.

"Elijah!" Anthony called, pushing through the tightening crowd. He caught up just as the old professor reached the faded wooden gate that led toward the dark treeline.

"Elijah, wait—what's going on?" Elijah glanced back, his piercing eyes scanning Anthony with something unreadable—recognition tinged with caution as if weighing whether to pull him into something far more dangerous than he could understand.

"It's happening again," Elijah muttered, his voice hoarse with urgency. His hand clenched around a battered leather satchel hanging from his shoulder, its buckles straining under what looked like crumbling yellowed papers and thick tomes.

"What's happening?" Anthony asked, a familiar spark of curiosity flaring. "The scream—was it—?"

"No time." Elijah's voice dropped to a growl. "Stay here. Keep her safe." His gaze flicked toward Josie, who was jogging toward them with her hands clenched into determined fists.

"Elijah, you—" Josie started, but Elijah had already shoved open the gate and disappeared through the thinning crowd.

Anthony turned toward Josie, breathless. "Did you see that? What the hell is he—"

"He's doing what he always does," Josie cut in, her face pale but steady. "Running toward trouble." The wind shifted, sending a sudden chill through the air. 

The lanterns overhead flickered and dimmed, casting long, twisting shadows across the cobblestone. Anthony thought he heard someone calling faintly from the woods beyond the gate.

Ringing out through the pathway to the woods, a second scream echoed through the old rusting carnival rides, closer this time - warmer, human. Alive. At least, for now - Josie's jaw tightened. "Stay here," she ordered, already moving toward the gate.

"Like hell," Anthony shot back, following close behind. Elijah barreled through the crowd, stopping abruptly near the gate. Anthony and Josie stumbled to a halt just behind him, craning around his shoulders, breath tight in their chests.

Sheriff Silas Thorne emerged from the shadows with a deliberate stride, his chiseled face framed by dark stubble and a Stetson pulled low. His broad shoulders filled the space like a barricade, making the rusty gate behind him seem frail in comparison. "You're blocking the gate?" Josie's voice was sharp, but her eyes lingered on Silas longer than she meant to - searching, questioning. "What the hell's going on?"

Silas adjusted his Stetson, shadowing sharp cheekbones and storm-dark eyes that rarely softened. “Nothing you need to worry about.” His voice was steady—flat—but the way his gaze lingered on her, unreadable, left something unsaid.

"Funny," she said. "You're real good at deciding what I need."

Silas' jaw tightened. "Not tonight." His voice was low and steady - a man used to being obeyed. "Already got one deputy missing. Don't need more."

His eyes flicked toward Horizon Consolidated's pristine booth, gleaming like polished steel among the ramshackle stalls. "They're too curious for their own good." 

Anthony's gaze snagged on one of the newer booths—a corporate monolith with slick banners reading Horizon Consolidated. Too polished. Too perfect. A company like that didn't belong in Stillwater, unless it wanted something. He pushed the frames of his glasses and looked closely at the misplaced booth. A young woman, hair pulled back in a tight bun, a soft and subtle tan, manned the booth. Cool and uncollected, her eyes focused on a clipboard as people rushed around her.

From the depths of the path came a low, guttural ras that was wet, uneven, wrong. It echoed against the rustling branches, too human to be animal, too twisted to be real. Twigs snapped under something heavy - something moving fast. Silas' hands gripped his handgun, slowly pulling it out of the sagging holster. Through dark foliage and jagger brush, something was approaching with a heavy but fast pace. 
With a loud clang and a hammer click, Anthony swiveled lightly on his feet. 

Reaching out from the gate was Ezekiel, the proprietor of the old mining exhibit. "H-hhh-help! My woman... she's done... she's... she up an' skedaddled, just like that. Gone, like a puff o' wind through the holler." He said in a low, raspy voice, slurred by whiskey and panic.

"You two get into another Whiskey-fueled squabble?" Josie said, giving a silent look towards Silas to lower his weapon. An unspoken code only bartenders - or lovers - may know. 

Picking out the brush from what remained of his hair, Ezekiel looked up with a serious tone. "She was reddin' up fer the festival, still wearin' her nightgown, pawin' through her dresser fer that fancy scarf she likes... an' the next thing I know, the front door's standin' wide open... an' she's plumb disappeared. She - She - GAHH!"  With a loud shout, he clutched his chest and fell to his knees, grasping tightly with the other hand on the rusted locked gate.

Amidst the chaos, a quiet but sharp voice somehow cut through the rising panic. AJ Anson, Stillwater's coroner, wove through the crowd with sharp, practiced precision, like a mouse navigating a deadly maze, her red hair catching in the flickering lantern light like a warning flare. "Move," she commanded, her tone steady despite the fear in her eyes, already reaching for her battered med bag. 

Her practiced hands steadied the trembling curator, motions automatic from too many long nights spent with the dead. Rising slowly, she met the others' expectant gazes. "He's stable," she said, though her eyes continuously drifting toward the dark path beyond the gate, where shadows seemed to breathe in the flickering light.

"So, about that deputy. Listen, if yinz need some help, we're right here." Josie said with a bored but intrigued smile. Silas hesitated, his hand resting on the worn grip of his revolver. His gaze flicked between the trembling Ezekiel and the dark, waiting woods. Abigail was out there—or something pretending to be her.

"You said she was wearing her favorite scarf?" Josie pressed, her voice steady but edged with urgency. "If she's calling for you, she might still be alive."

Silas narrowed his eyes. "It's not safe."

"Since when has that stopped any of us?" Josie stepped forward, defiance shining in her eyes. "You can either let us help or waste time arguing while she gets farther away."

AJ nodded, her expression grim. "We don't have time. You - you know how fast people disappear out here."

A tense silence settled between them, heavy with shared history and bitter memories. Finally, Silas grunted, jerking his chin toward the open gate. "Stay close. Don't wander. If you see anything out of place...you run. Understood?"

With a collective breath, they plunged into the woods, lantern light fading behind them as tangled branches swallowed the trail. Branches tangled overhead, wet leaves clogging the air with the stench of decay. Lantern light barely pierced the darkened path, colder than it should’ve been this far into the festival season.

No one spoke, tension weaving between them like the tangled roots underfoot. The path wound unevenly, each step met with the crunch of brittle leaves or the soft, damp squelch of mud. Anthony's pen trembled against his notebook, scribbling out half-formed thoughts. He didn't know if he was taking notes—or leaving evidence.

"Anyone else feel like... we're being watched?" AJ asked, her voice quiet, her throat choking on the words. She looked to the others with regret the moment the words left her.

"Always," Silas muttered without looking back. His hand hovered near the worn grip of his revolver, scanning the shifting dark.

The trail narrowed further until they reached a shallow creek, its water sluggish and dark like spilled ink. Smooth, moss-slick stones jutted from the surface, forming an uneven path.

"I'll go first," Josie offered, already stepping onto the first stone. Her boots found purchase despite the slick surface, balancing with practiced ease.

Anthony followed, though his footing wavered. Halfway across, his shoe slipped—sending loose rocks tumbling into the water with a sharp splash.

Silence swallowed the sound. The forest held its breath, silent until a sudden SNAP.

A sharp rustling in the undergrowth. Something large, just out of sight. "Keep moving," Silas hissed, urgency coiled tight. He reached out, steadying Anthony with a firm grip. They crossed quickly, AJ casting a final glance toward the now-still brush before hurrying to catch up.
The trail twisted again, narrowing into a passage walled by ancient oaks whose gnarled roots clawed from the ground like skeletal fingers. Something fluttered in the faint breeze ahead—a flash of fabric snagged on a thorny bush.

Josie reached it first. "Blood," she muttered, fingertips brushing the torn, faded scarf. Crimson soaked its frayed edges.

"That's Abigail's," Silas confirmed grimly. "She always wore it at the festival."

AJ took the scarf, her gloved hands steady despite the chill creeping up her spine. Her voice barely steadied as she whispered, "The… the blood’s still tacky. She’s not dead - at least not yet."

The trail dead-ended at a rusted chain-link fence tangled in creeping vines. “DANGER: KEEP OUT” glared in faded red paint.

A mining pickaxe jutted from the damaged power box at the base of the fence. Dark scorch marks streaked across its surface, the faint hum of electricity now gone. Anthony traced the jagged cut where the metal had been sheared. "Someone didn't just break in...they cut the power."

"Abigail?" AJ guessed.

"Or someone chasing her," Silas growled. Without waiting, Josie yanked the pickaxe free. The metal whined, rust crumbling like dried blood. The air felt...wrong as the hum died completely. The silence that followed was sharp, like a blade drawn across stone.

"Through here," Silas ordered, pushing the gate open with a groaning creak.

They pressed deeper into the woods, guided by faint, broken trails of trampled underbrush. Drag marks streaked through the wet earth, punctuated by bloody handprints smeared against a twisted tree trunk. AJ traced the bloody handprints with trembling fingers, her breath hitching. "She fought... but she was running."

Silas's jaw tightened. "She wasn't alone." The forest exhaled—a low, 
shivering breath through the leaves. From deep within the tangled dark came a wet, guttural rasp—too human to be animal, too twisted to be real.

Anthony's breath hitched, his gaze locked on the shadows that seemed to swell with intent.

"What the hell was that?" Josie whispered, her voice thin and sharp.
Silas drew his revolver, the hammer snapping into place with a cold finality.

Footsteps. Heavy. Deliberate. Crack. Snap. Something twisted in the dark.

"Back up," Silas ordered, voice sharp and steady. They retreated toward the ruined trail, breathing shallow, hearts pounding in sync with the crushing steps.

Through clenched teeth, Silas hissed, “Run!” under his breath as he tried to usher everyone back towards the gate, but it was too late. No one could hear him through their pounding hearts as they scurried into the rolling fog of the woods. Grinding his teeth, Silas considered pulling out his flashlight. It was too late.
