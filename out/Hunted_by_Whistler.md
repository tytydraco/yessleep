I heard you guys like scary stories. Here's a story for you guys. Its important for you to know. Please read carefully so you know what it is. I need help and I need it before it comes for me.


It was the middle of summer 2006, it had been an especially hot summer where I lived. Because of this and my new car with a broken AC unit, I'd taken to driving with my windows down. At least that's what I told everyone. I really just liked listening to the new band Five finger Death Punch really loud to try to impress any cute girls I drove past. I was the only one of my friends to have a driver's license, and I lived in a rural city of thirty thousand people surrounded by a dozen or so small towns with maybe two thousand in the largest of them. Because of this my friends would use their money from allowances and jobs to pay me for driving them to and from their homes so we could get up to all manner of mischief.


We had spent much of the summer enjoying messing around and going to the occasional party. It was a Monday evening if I remember right. We had gone to a party at the local lake. There had been cliff jumping, swimming, boats, and beer. Being the only one with a car I was the stuck designated driver while my friends got drunk. I still had a blast causing chaos with my three friends and trying to flirt with any girl who would listen in our poor attempts to get our first girlfriends, though nit tainted by the haze of teenage drunkenness. 


Eventually it began to get dark. The boats were docked for fear of hitting anyone swimming in the water. Most of the swimmers too began to get out of the water, a sort of primal fear of swimming in the already clouded green waters now darkening to greens quickly approaching a black inkieness. Most of the activities had already died down and the bulk of the partygoing teens began to head home. By the time my friends and I had decided it was time to give up on seducing a hot girl most all the people left were older couples going skinny dipping or making out in various semi secret nooks illuminated by the handful of lights and lanterns left around. 


We were walking back to my car my friends being drunk and just realizing they couldnt hold their beer notlw that the girls were gone were wobbling and nearly at once all six of their eyes widened and their faces green pale in the low light. Soon they were all throwing up into a bush as I waited for them. A handful of people passed us and i got a chill and the wind picked up. A faint whistling suddenly became audible to my ears. I looked to find it because in the way places became after a loud boisterous party, oddly quiet, and the whistling was rather sudden and caught my attention. 


As my head snapped in the direction I saw someone, a guy I'd seen at the party just relaxing leaning on a tree, he'd seemed off at the party, not interacting with people like usual, I'd just chalked it up to something like the autism a handful of teens and young adults I went to school with had. Now he looked naturaul and relaxed. Nothing seemed off anymore, well exept he was alone and not yet leaving the party. I thought he may have been waiting for a ride or something. Just as I had determined there was nothing to be spooked by I saw a figure in the shadows behind him, almost superimposed over the shadows behind him. Something tall and humanoid and pale. Then it vanished. A chill ran down my spine and I thought it must have been some alcohol or something. I had to have accidentally drunk a little. 


Now a little unsettled but trying to convince myself everything was fine I went back to making sure my friends weren't covered in their own vomit, I ran the 20 steps to my car and grabbed my napkin stash to wipe their faces and hands before laying down towels in the seats to keep my car dry. We drove with the windows down and as my friends recovered from their unfortunate vomiting episode we drove across the area and began to sing and yell and have the kind of conversations drunk teenagers have. I dropped my friends off one by one and began to turn the radio to more relaxing music as the mood began to settle with the lower numbers. 


I pulled up to my last friends house, Kay was my absolute best friend at the time, he stayed that way for years and we had one of the many conversations we always had about girls, who we thought we'd marry that week, and the newest albums we loved. Eventually the conversation turned a little more dark as we did have a fondness for spooky things. I decided it would be better to mention the kid and weird shadow thing to him than not mention it as with the limits the internet had at the time, he was my best source of knowledge on the occult. I still remember the conversation clearly to this day, though I couldn't tell you why for the life of me.


"Hey Kay, remember when y'all were barfing your guts out in that bush?"

"Thats kinda hard to forget Matt. Why do ya ask? Did ya get a cute chika's number while our snacks and beer decided to evacuate asap?"

"No nothing like that. I saw soem thing freaky. You know that kid we didn't recognize, the weird one?"

"Oh totally. I think I heard him say he was someone's cousin. Don't remember who though. I was too busy trying to get past him to talk to Brittnay."

"Typical." We laughed for a moment before continuing. "He was chilling after the party by a tree whistling. Caught my attention. But just before I looked away I saw a weird really tall pale man like figure. Like eight or nine feet tall super gaunt and super long limbs. He was crazy pale too. Almost see-through like he almost half existed or something."

"Thats sketchy dude. No idea what that'd be though. It probably won't bother you though. Just get home quick."

"Not what I hoped to hear but I'll do that. See ya tomorrow."
 
"See ya."
   
We did our special little handshake and he went inside while I got into my idling car again. I made sure everything was in order and turned the music up a bit. I began to drive the just short of nine miles back to town passing dairies, cornfields, and the occasional house. 


The road was a 50 mph speed limit, but the sherrifs were pretty relaxed about speeding across the area and I wanted to get home quick so I was pushing 60 as I drove down the road listening to music. A new song I hadn't heard before came on the radio as I listened. It was fun to listen to and even had a really nice whistling part I particularly liked. 


The song then had a quiet moment as the whistling continued through it before it began again. Then just a couple seconds later terror gripped me. I knew this new song. This song didn't have any whistling. I immidiatly checked my backseat to make sure nobody had snuck in. It was empty aside from damp towels. My passenger seat was empty too. The trunk hadn't been unlocked the whole night so nothing could be in there without breaking the car open. I turned the radio off just to be sure the whistling wasn't just part of the radio. It kept going, but instead of whistling to the song it whistled its own tune. The same one that the kid by the tree whistled. My heart dropped even further as realized I'd been followed. I checked my side view mirrors to see if there was a car behind me. None behind, none oncoming, and then I checked my rear view mirror attached to the windshield. 


I saw the figure from earlier. It was outside my car. Crouched down. I saw its face in exquisite detail. Well, it's lack of a face. It was so pale it made my friends faces before barfing look as tan as a beach girls, exept for its eyes. In total grayscale deep dark and smooth pits where it's eyes should be seemingly bore I to me. Yo this day they are the closest I've seen to that quote, "You stare into the abyss and it stares back, pulling you deeper in." Or something like that. I can never remember the words. Where a nose usually sits were two deep long slits, almost akin to gills on a shark. They flared every few seconds as it seemed to breathe, and it's mouth was seemingly nonexistant. No lips or anything. 


Then it realized I had certainly seen it. It's response still haunts my nightmares to this day. It smiled. Only then did I see it's mouth. A gash in its face that could seal perfectly and become invisible until its lips parted in that hideous smile like its face had been cut open. Inside sharp teeth in a crooked and haphazard arrangment and a tongue that was almost like a tentacle, but black and dripping an oily tar like saliva. Nearly a year later in a theater I felt a sense of terror like this again when I saw a rather similar smile again in Spiderman 3 as vemons face was revealed on the big screen.


After the creature smiled, it's tongue lashing like a snake, it moved to the side of my car with unnaturaul smoothness. I watched it in my Sideview mirror as it then quickly moved up to my side. I was far from frozen in fear but my thoughts were racing so fast coming up witg so many ideas and responses I couldn't formulate what I really wanted my body to do and so I sat there trying to do every thing at once and failing miserably at every course of action  as it moved up right next to me, disturbingly thin, nearly pure flesh and bone. 


Once it was next to me a long unnaturally long hand with fingers so long and grasping lifted from its side and reached into my open window towards the steering wheel. In that instant I finally had a single course of action. I left one hand in the steering wheel and floored it. I quickly sped up and swiped the creatures hand from my window earning a scar on the back of my hand that was my only proof this ever happened for years, until it faded with time.


I began to roll up my windows desprate to close them despite my conviction I had outrun it as I was beginning to push eighty miles per hour now. Then I checked my rearview mirror to be sure, and saw the creature had at some point dropped to all fours and was gaining on me rather quickly again. Soon it was by my side again as I reached ninety miles per hour and reached inside my car again. I swatted its long gangly hand out of the widow again and continued to roll the windows up painfully slow. I had to slap its hand out two more times before I could seal the windows shut again. I pauses for a moment sure the only reason I was still alive was I had gone fast enough it had to run on all fours. Then watching it and the road at the same time I reached one hundred miles per hour. One of two times I ever made my car go that fast. 


The creature sealed its mouth shut again, it's teeth and tongue dissapearing behind that seamless seal once again. The whistling began again. That same cheery melody that after that encounter sent chills down my back and a deep and primal fear flooded into my chest filling it too full for any other emotion to register. Then the creature slowly returned to my back window again right in the rearview mirror, then It slowed, stopped and, it's whistling quickly going quieter, and then dashed into a cornfield. 


Only then did relief begin to fill me again. Then two realizations occurred to me as lights began to flash red and blue. The first, not a single other car had been in sight the entire chase. The second, I was now going one hundred miles per hour and stumbled on what had to be the only speed trap in 50 miles. I pulled over just outside of town now, and the sheriff did the same before walking to my car. 


When he was close I opened the window just a little bit. It was Deputy Hayber. He had always been fond of me and my friends as we'd helped his family a couple times in the past. I dotn remember this clearly, but from our talks later it went something like this. He wanted to know why I'd been going so fast and was just getting ready to yell at me when he realized I was so pale in the face and shaking as though it was 10 degrees outside. Then he noticed the gash dripping blood and simply asked what happened. I gave him a muddled response about a whistling figure with a horrible mouth that wanted to kill me.


Some kind of recognition appeared on his face after my poor explanation and he said simply, "Okay kid. I'll give you an escort home, make sure you stay safe." He then returned to his car and we headed back into town. I got home safe and I have no idea how I slept that night.


The next month had been one of jumping at shadows and every whistle I heard. My friends didn't beleive my story until a conversation with the deputy at a town barbecue later that week where he essentially told them I was telling them the truth. That night driving my friends home past that same cornfield it ran into, this time the windows closed as closed could be, we all heard the whistling once again. I was the only one to see the face in that cornfield. After that my friends and I obsessed over it for a few months untik no new information could be found. We eventually determined it was a skinwalker or something like that, at least that's what it seemed most similar to of all the creepy creatures and haunting myths out there. When no new information was forthcoming on the creature or what to do about it we eventually moved past it.


Flash forward to the last few months, life has gone well for us all. Kay got married and has twin toddlers and an infant. I still haven't married at 34, but I have a long term girlfriend I might have proposed to and had a family with if things had turned out differently. Two of my friends left this town and are sucessful. One has a wife he met during his time in germany, and the other a husband he met after moving to California. Kay and I stayed here as it's grown into a moderate city and each of those small towns is the size this place uses to be. 


Well now that you know happened originally and what things are like now, here's why that story was important. I need help and I need it before it comes for me.


Four months ago, just four days before the now Sheriff Hayber was going to retire he responded to an animal attack as he was just a mile away from it. By the time the police and animal control made it out there just 8 minutes after he did he was found mauled by some kind fo animal, not a single shot fired from his gun and an arm and leg missing. He had a closed casket funeral and they kept the story out of the news to respect his wishes. I didn't suspect anything then, though the area is still spooked by the mauling and is looking for the animal that did it. Not that it'll do them any good. 


Kay went camping two weeks ago. He was only supposed to be gone for 2 days. When police were sent they found blood across the cabin and Kay's bones minus his skull and  the top two vertabrae as thoigh hed been decapitated. The bones were cracked and the marrow sucked out not a scrap of meat left. No animals had been inside and there were no signs of breaking and entering. His phone was left with a note saying to give it to me so I could watch a video. 


When the phone was given to me so I could watch the video I was in an interrogation room. There was a detective and an officer there to keep an eye on me. They showed me the phone screen and pressed play. Kay was frantically revmcording out of the cabin windows and I heard his heavy breathing and shaky words. 

"Can you hear it? Does the phone pick it up? It's that whistling. I can hear it again. You know the one Matt. Here listen." He went quiet and stiffled his breathing. Then I could hear it. It was quiet but then it got louder. I didn't need it to get louder though. The second I hear did I felt the blood drain from my face. 

"Nonono that can't be happening. It's been almost twenty years." Yet it was happening. Then a noise came from the front door and the whistling centered on it seeming just beyond it rather than everywhere. It was a scratch, long slow and eerie enough it sent chills down the detectives back as she stoikly watched. 

"FUCK! GET AWAY YOU!!! IV'E GOT A GUN! I KNOW YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ME YOU PIECE OF SHIT!! WHY ARE YOU HEAR AND WHY DO YOU FUCKING WHISTLE??" I paused with anticipation. Surely it wouldn't respond even if it could. 


Then the whistling stopped suddenly. And in an imitation of the Dead Sherrifs voice so perfect it could be him, aside from the terrifying and evil words I heard, it spoke. "Kay, son, I'm just here to say hi and make sure you're okay. I also want to send a message to Matt. I'm sure you understand." A moment of silence before the sherrifs voice took a tone he never could have in life. Dripping with pure evil and malevolence. "My whistling though. Well I do that because it's fun Kay. In all my life I've found it so much more fun to whistle rather than mimic. It makes you all the more scared before you die. Maybe you'd like it too if you had ever tried it."


Everyone in the room grew quiet and I felt terror slowly fill me as I then heard the door unlock and saw it open. That grin spread across its face, the same one from that night, and it stalked in on all pale gaunt and Gainey fours as it had run that night. A gun shot and the camera shook as nearly a dozen shots unloaded into the creatures face, not harming it in the slightest. Then, after a horrific moment of silence and a sob of fear from Kay, it pounced and Kay screamed and dropped the phone. A few moments of silence punctuated only by a wet sound and the death gurgles and sobs of terror from Kay as he was presumably killed. My eyes welled up with tears and my heart filled with pure unadulterated sorrow and terror. Kay didn't deserve this. Nobody did. 


Then I heard steps of a four footed creature and that head now covered in blood, Kay's blood. That was Kay's blood not just any blood. Then it grinned again before speaking in Kay's voice. "Matt, I normally whistle but perhaps if I take your voice I'd stop whistling. It's such a fun voice. One I could create such fear with and cause so many evil and deliciously fun terrors amid endless slaughter.  Prepare to join your friend Kay, though he wont be anything but bones when you find him. The feel of flesh tearing his blood spattering and the sweet and wonderful crunch as i shatter his bones, they're too good to resist. Ill do that to you too. I'm doing this all for you you know. You and your lovely voice. Await my aproach. You'll know I'm hear. You know my whistle so well don't you?" 


Then it dissapeared and returned with Kay's lifeless corpse. His neck had been ripped out. A chunk was missing and blood was still draining from him. Then the creature placed his limp head in its mouth and crushed it. Bits splattered as it did so with a sickening and wet crunch. I nearly vomited at the sound and sight and the detective blanched while the security officer did grab the garbage can in the corner. The creature swallowed before speaking again. "I didn't mean to make that much of a mess. I'll have to clean that up. Oh, and I'd be so flattered if you thought of me as Whistler. It's a properly ominous and threatening name. I do have to go now though. I want to finish Kay's body before it gets cold. He tastes so much better that way."


I've just left the police station and I need help. Can I fight it? Can I kill it? Should I try? Should I let it take me or should I deny it any peice if me? I need answers. I don't know what to do. I need help and I need it before it comes for me.
