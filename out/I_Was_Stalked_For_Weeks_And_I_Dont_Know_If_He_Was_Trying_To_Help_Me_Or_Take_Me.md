He'd been following me for about two weeks.


Whenever I went for a walk, I could hear him behind me. At first, I kept looking over my shoulders to try and catch him, but, I could never see anyone, and I just ended up looking paranoid after a while. And whenever I *did* manage to see him, he seemed like just another normal person.



The first time I saw him, he was just a confusing blur. All I could make out was that he was wearing dark clothes, and I could never make out his face. It was always somehow hidden.



Another week passed by and my paranoia grew. I was working late one night and had missed the last bus home. The rural roads of which I had to walk were completely engulfed by the shadows of the night.


*Great.* I Huffed to myself.



*Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop.*



His footsteps seemed to appear from nowhere again, and I instantly stopped and held my breath. They echoed and bounced all around me, and they had a hauntingly hypnotic rhythm.



*Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop.*



It almost resembled the sound of heels, or... hooves, perhaps?



I immediately turned to identify the source.



He was close, yet, still too far away to make any sort of resounding features. He was tall and thin, though. Very thin. And very tall. He was wearing a long, black and hooded robe that covered him entirely. So again, I couldn't see his face.




The next time I heard his footsteps, I was on my way to meet friends for some drinks. I had to once again walk the darkest of roads, and that's when that gut-wrenching, heart-pounding, '*clip-clop*', made my whole jaw clench and my eyes pop wide open.



*Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop.*



I walked faster.



*Clip-clop, clip-clop.*



My walk soon turned into a jog...



*Clip-clop, clip-clop.*



His steps were unwavered, never losing or gaining speed, yet it seemed as though he was always behind me.



**CLIP-CLOP!**



...I ran.



"Aaaargh! Ja-ja-just fuck off and leave me alone will you!" I yelled. My body was running on 10% adrenaline and 90%fear.



I did an awkward head turn while still trying to outrun him, causing my body to bend, twist and contort. Gravity took care of the rest.



I hit the road, hard, and I felt the sudden pain in multiple places.



*Clip, clop...clip, clop*



I suddenly stopped breathing as I realised he was now standing directly behind me.



I slowly rolled over onto my back, looked up, and saw his thin and crispy body standing above me, his skin was wriggling and writhing through his flapping, flowing robes. His outer layer breathed and moved like some sort of liquid dust, and in the centre of his tiny mass, there was a small but deep slice, slowly emitting a thick, black smoke.



The hood to his robe fully surrounded his head, so once again, I *still* couldn't see his face.


I had absolutely no words for him, and I think he somehow knew that. He slowly raised his right arm and pointed to something behind me.


The unaware driver of the van finally looked up from his phone as he came speeding towards me. He panicked and fumbled, but somehow managed to swerve in time and miss me. Miss *us*.


The van collided with a nearby tree at full speed and crumbled instantly. There was no way the driver had survived.


The black hooded figure looked down at me, turned and looked at the crash, then back at me again. 


He nonchalantly shrugged his shoulders and walked away towards the crash. As he approached the drivers body, I heard him scream a thousand screams, and raised his arms to remove his hood...


*POOF!*


And just like that, he disappeared.


I can't stop thinking about it, and I still don't know if he was trying to help me, or, was actually here to take me.
