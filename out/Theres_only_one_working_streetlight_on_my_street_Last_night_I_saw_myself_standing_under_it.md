I reside in the suburbs of a quiet, gray town, the kind you'd find in nostalgia-drenched magazines, or old TV shows. 

Rows of identical houses sit neatly side by side, their lawns freshly mowed.  The neighbors are friendly, always smiling, and every now and then someone drops off a homemade chicken casserole. 

It's the kind of place that looks like a true gem of the American dream.



But lately, something's been off....



I moved into this house, with my late fiancée about a year ago.  We were like every young couple--naive, full of hope, and dizzy with love. 

But our purple patch didn't last long. The dream we have hoped to build up collapsed  after the accident, and it left me stranded in this place we once called paradise.

Now, it felt more like hell.

  
There were weeks, when I didn't step outside, just rotting away in guilt, and sorrow. It got so bad that my younger sister eventually forced me to get psychiatric help.

In time, I returned home and managed, in some ways, to get back on my feet. I learned to be again, to function.

Deep down, however I knew nothing could ever fill the void her absence had left in my heart.

It's been almost five months since then.

  
I've  managed to hold down a new job since then, and even made a few friends around the neighbourhood. Most evenings, I try to stay occupied--anything to keep the late-night thoughts from creeping in. Sometimes I'll watch TV, read, clean or drop in on friends or family. But yesterday was different.

I got home around 7p.m., drained after a miserable day at work. All I wanted was to switch off--take a long, and relaxing bath and crawl into bed as soon as possible. That plan vanished the moment I noticed something strange outisde

Despite how idylic our neighborhood seems, it does have one lingering issue: for the past two or three months, the streetlights have been cutting off after 10 p.m. No one knows why.

The city claimed it was a simple electrical fault--something about outdated wiring, and budget cuts. They assured us it would be resolved "soon," but that was months ago. A few neighbors called the city council, but after a while, even they stopped bothering to ask. 

Some blamed it on the town's shrinking budget, others joked that the darkness added "character" to the street. But no one pushed too hard. Perhaps we were all a little too comfortable, or maybe... some part of us didn't want to know what the dark might be hiding.

When I was about to close the blinds on my bedroom window, I noticed that one of the lights, the one directly in front of my house, was actually working.  


This suprised me. I never thought I'd see any of them light up again, at least not anytime soon.

To be fair, it was barely flickering, like the last breath of a dying bulb, so I brushed it off, assuming some reserve energy had found its way into the circuit.

Just when I was about to look away, and finally shut the blinds, something caught my eye again.

There was a silhouette standing under the hypnotic light of the streetlamp.

At first, I wanted to look away. Probably just a neighbor, I thought. Or maybe a repairman. (though I doubted anyone would nother coming out this late to fix a single streetlight) Still, something about the figure felt.... off. The more I stared, the clearer it became. 

It wasn't doing anything in particular, just standing there like a statue.

That's when I noticed it was wearing the same green shirt I had on earlier. With my gray shorts, and even the same watch I got from my mother for my birthday.

I started thinking it might just be some drunk weirdo who stumbled here by accident. But that's when I saw its face.

"What the hell?"- I muttered, my voice tight with a confusion.

It's facial features were almost exactly like mine. The same narrow, rat-like nose. The clean-shaven face. Even the faint bruise on the side of my forehead (the one that I had since the accident)  

Everything was identical.

Everything, except for one.

It didn't have eyes....

Where the eye scokets should've been, there was only smooth, unbroken skin.

Blank. Featureless. Wrong....

Yet it looked like, it was watching me.

Suddenly I've looked away to trying to find something to take a photo with, but as I went back the thing vanished.

The streetlight flickered once more, before going out once again.

"Fucking hell,"-I whispered.

"I must be on the verge of exhaustion.... Have I started to hallucinate things now?"

I closed the blinds quickly, and as dumb as it sounds, I went to bed almost immediately, shrugging off the entire thing as a stress-induced illusion.



The next day passed quickly, though I couldn't shake the strange events of the night before. 

"What have I seen?"

"Did I see anything at all? Or perhaps.... someone?"

I got home that evening and tried to drown out my thoughts the usual way, but nothing helped. Curiosity had its claws in me.

Eventually, I gave in.

I decided to stay up, hoping-no, needing to see if the thing would reappear again under that lone streetlight outside. Even if it meant I'd be a sleep-deprived mess at work the next day.

At exactly 11:47 PM, the lights blinked on again.

And just like before, the figure appeared.

Only this time, it was closer.

Much closer.

It was no longer standing on the far sidewalk across the street, instead it was on my side now, only a few feet from my front lawn.

Still unmoving. Still looking at me.

This time, I was more prepared.

Phone in hand, I waited near the window for the right moment.

Quckily I raised the phone and snapped the picture, my camera flashing.

"Shit, I've forgot to turn it off"

The streetlight immediately went out.

And so did the figure.

The photo turned out blurry and unrecognizable

There was a decent 1 or 2 minutes of suffocating silence. 

I was just about to cloes the blinds and try to go to sleep when I heard it.

Pounding.

Loud, and violent.

Coming from my front door downstairs.

I froze, not knowing how to react.

"Maybe if I stay still, it'll go away."

I was wrong.

The pounding didn't stop, instead it got worse.

I could hear the lock shaking, and turning.

It was trying to get inside.

Panic set in. I opened the window, yelling into the night, but street was silent.

Dead.

No lights. No stirred curtains. No response. Nothing.

I knew I had to confront it, to fight back somehow.

But I couldn't.

I couldn't move an inch.

I had to hide somewhere.

"Why is this happening to me? Oh God... please help me.... somebody.... please..."

Before I could even decide where to go, I heard it.

The door slammed open.

Footsteps.

Wet footsteps, sticking, and peeling from the floor.

The creature was searching for me.

I heard it make sounds, which best could be descirbed as choking, or gurgling.

I quickly hid under my bed, unsure whether it would find me or not.

It started to climb the stairs, slowly, each step creaking, and groaning under its feet.

And then... silence once again befall me.

I held my breath, every single one of my nerves was on fire.

I wanted to peek out, just for a second, to see if it was still there.

That's when I finally got a good look of it.

Standing just outside my bedroom.

Its clothes were ripped, torn beyond recognition.

Its face, and body was bleeding, and had bruises all over it.

There was a strange dark liquid leaking out of its skin where the eyes where the eyes should've been

It looked like it was crying.

It didn't came in.

It just stood there.

Shaking.

Breathing.

Suffering.

Then it whispered something, its voice like gravel being dragged across wood.

"Not....Your....Fault...."

I don't remember what happened afterwards.

Maybe I passed out.

Maybe I just... shut down.

All I know is that I woke up alive

And the thing was gone.

That was enough for me.

I've decided to move back to my hometown, to stay with my parents, and my sister for a while.

I've already put the house up for sale, and I've even started looking for a new job.

This place, for all its charm, and quiet, had become a cage of bad memories for me.

The loss of my fiancée....

The nights that followed...

I can't live there anymore.

But latetly, I've been feeling better.

Lighter, somehow.

Like a weight has been lifted from my chest.

Maybe all of it, the thing, the lights, the darkness, and the hours that felt like days, the months that felt like years.

Maybe all of it, wasn't just a haunting.

Perhaps it was a reckoning.

A reason to face everything I was running from.

Something greater than guilt.

Greater than grief.

Maybe...

it was a way to say goodbye.
