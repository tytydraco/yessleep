As excited as I was to start college, I was also scared. I'd heard so many horror stories. The world's a dangerous place for young women like me. Luckily, my roommate understood. She didn't kick up a fuss at the safety measures I suggested.

It seemed she'd tease me about it, though. 

When I opened the closet, I expected it be clean and prepared for my clothes and bulk ramen. Instead, it had a single occupant: a steel sword straight out of ye olden times.

My roommate was out at the time, but I planned to ask her about it when she returned. However, with the hustle of getting all my books together and learning my way around campus, I forgot all about it, and it stayed where I'd found it for those first couple weeks.

My paranoia got the better of me. I developed insomnia. The lack of sleep made it hard to focus, and I couldn't afford to have my grades slip.

One night before an exam, I considered my problem. No amount of telling myself no one would break in was helping so I needed to make it seem less dangerous. That's when I had an idea.

Snatching the sword out of the closet, I inspected it. It was sharp, plain, and not too heavy to pick up in an emergency. I leaned it up beside my bed.

It was the best sleep I'd had in weeks.

My roommate asked me about the sword the next morning. It seemed she hadn't brought it, so the only explanation was it was left by another student. I thought they cleaned out all the rooms over the summer. They must've overlooked it.

Every night after, I slept peacefully with my steel companion at my side. It seemed harmless. What with the reports of missing persons in the area, I felt like I really needed it. My emotional support sword made me feel safe.

I never realized before how much laundry my mom did. It seemed I had to wash my clothes way too often. I didn't know how dirty shoes got, either. Where does all the dirt and grass even come from? I walked on pavement all day.

I didn't know I sleepwalked, either.

I had no idea until my roommate asked where I would go every night. Mortified, I apologized for waking her. "It's not a big deal," she laughed, "I just wanna know why you take your sword. What do you do, have a big role play party at 3AM every night?"

I tried not to panic as I thought about that.

Laughing nervously, I made an excuse. I didn't want to scare her.

On my way to class, I chucked that sword in a dumpster. As much as I liked sleep, I didn't like my body doing things without telling me. 

You can probably guess what happened. I woke up the next day covered in trash juice with the sword back in place.

I kept trying to get rid of it. I even passed it off to my roommate, but I took it back after waking up to her standing over me. I think I know what the rules are.

The problem right now isn't just that I've been sleepwalking. My roommate is missing and I know where she is. I know where all of them are, but I can't tell anyone. 

I need to find someone who wants it.

If you or someone you know is in the market for a cursed sword, please come get it. Must reside more than a day's walk from campus.
