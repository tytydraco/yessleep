The last thing I remember is the sound of the crash. Glass shattering, metal twisting, Emily’s scream.

Then, silence.

When I opened my eyes, I was here. Floating in this... nothing. It’s not dark. It’s not light. It’s just absence. No ground beneath my feet, no air to breathe, no sound to keep me company.

I called out.
“Hello?”

My voice didn’t echo; it just disappeared, like it never existed.

Panic came next. I screamed until my throat burned. I waved my arms, tried to walk, but there was nothing to walk on. I was suspended in a void—weightless, helpless.

Then I remembered Emily.
My God, Emily.
Where is she? Is she okay?

“Emily!” I shouted, over and over.
“Emily, please! Say something!”

Nothing answered.


I can’t tell time anymore. I don’t sleep. I don’t eat. My body feels... wrong. I don’t get tired, but I’m exhausted. My thoughts are the only thing keeping me company, and they’re starting to turn on me.

Emily’s laugh keeps playing in my head. That giggle she’d do when I tickled her.
But now it’s distorted—warped into something unknown.

Her face is starting to blur.
How is that possible? She’s my daughter. I know her face.
But every time I try to picture it, it slips further away.

It’s like my brain is unraveling, piece by piece.


How long has it been? A day? A week?

I’ve started talking to myself.
Not in my head—out loud. Just to hear something, anything.

“I’m still here,” I tell myself.
“I’m still alive. This is real.”

But is it? How can it be? No one’s found me. No one’s answered. What if I’m already dead? What if this is... it?

I tried to pinch myself, but I don’t feel pain anymore.
My skin doesn’t bruise. My hands don’t shake.
I think my body’s stopped working, and only my mind is left.

That’s worse.


Emily’s laugh is gone.

Now it’s just silence.

I can’t remember her birthday. Was she eight? Or nine?
God, what kind of father forgets something like that?
What kind of monster—

“You don’t deserve her.”

That wasn’t my thought.
That was... something else.


I saw it today.

A reflection.

It’s not a mirror; it’s just me. Standing there, staring back. But it’s wrong. Its eyes are hollow, its expression blank.

“Who are you?” I asked.

It didn’t answer. It just smiled.


“Let me out,” I begged it. “Please, I’ll do anything.”

“You don’t understand,” it said, its voice cold and detached. “There is no ‘out.’ There is no escape.”

“There has to be!” I screamed. “I have a daughter! I have to get back to her!”

The reflection tilted its head.
“You don’t even remember her face. How can you return to what you’ve already lost?”

I froze.

“I... I remember her,” I whispered. “I do.”

But even as I said it, the truth hit me like a punch to the gut.
I couldn’t remember her face. Or her voice. Or the way her hand felt in mine.

“See?” the reflection said softly. “You’re not fighting for her. You’re fighting to avoid the truth.”


The memory came back to me in flashes.

The crash.
The scream.
The moment I realized I couldn’t stop the car in time.

Emily wasn’t screaming for me.
She was screaming because of me.

I killed her.


The reflection didn’t have to say it—I already knew.

This place, this void, isn’t a punishment.
It’s a mercy. It’s what’s left of me, clinging to the illusion that I’m still alive.

“I don’t want to forget her,” I whispered.

“You already have.”

I looked at its hand, outstretched toward me. It wasn’t forcing me. It was giving me a choice.

I could stay here, alone, unraveling. Or I could take its hand, let go, and finally—finally—fade.

“Emily,” I whispered one last time.

And then, I reached out.
