*This is the reported transcript of the unaired episode of “Hidden Mysteries”. Intended to be the seventeenth episode of the series, it is now considered lost. “Hidden Mysteries” has been cancelled since the airing of the previous episode, although there are rumors that there have been more sinister forces at play, causing the show to suddenly seize production. Now, “Hidden Mysteries” is infamously known for its singular lost episode that nobody has ever seen.*

*We received this transcript via an email two days ago by an unknown sender. Alongside this were some notes by the sender, digitally written on the sides of the pages. We tried contacting the emailer, but still no response. Additionally, we’ve tried searching for the email address through online email verifiers, but we could not find anything. It is as if the email has been deleted, or it never existed in the first place.*

*We have read the whole transcript. I was the one to edit this article for you guys, highlighting the most important parts of what was given to us.*

*I shall warn you, Haunted Fam, this is quite chilling. Viewer discretion is advised.*

*I present to you, the lost episode of “Hidden Mysteries”. This is what would have been episode seventeen, titled, “The Blue Corner.”*

**The intro of the show plays as usual. What is mysterious, however, according to the sender, is that two seconds before the end of the intro, a blue screen flashes, with a white face in the middle. It’s a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment. When the sender tried to replay it, the image was gone, the intro clean and playing smoothly.**

**After the intro, the episode begins with a reenactment of a seventeen-year old boy sitting in front of his computer.**

**Billy Hernandez**: James Wanson, aged seventeen, was last seen on November 14, 2018, in his home in a small town. According to his mother, May Wanson, James was in his room working on his English essay prior to his disappearance. At around 8:42 p.m., May went to his room to tell him to eat dinner. When she opened the door, he was nowhere to be found. His bed was unmade, his slippers tucked neatly under them, and the windows were closed. May didn’t think too much of it at first, supposing that he had gone to the bathroom or somewhere downstairs without her noticing. Before she left her son’s room, she saw the screen of his computer light up. The screen was merely blue, no words or graphics or anything of the sort.

**After the quick introduction of the mystery, the episode cuts to a talking head of May Wanson, her eyes swollen and bloodshot, her nose red. She is forty-one years old, but the front strands of her hair have gone white.**

**May Wanson:** When I saw that blue screen, goosebumps went down my back. I suddenly felt like there was someone else in the room with me. At that moment, I knew that something bad had happened. Naturally, we—my husband and I—searched the whole house first, then we called his friends around the neighborhood to ask them if James was with any of them. When we didn’t get any good answers, we finally called the police, but they weren’t able to do anything. Or maybe, they *didn’t* want to do anything. They told us that we had to wait until morning first to see if James would come back.

**May starts crying.**

**May Wanson:** Two years later and he’s still missing.

**The episode cuts to a producer behind the camera handing Mrs. Wanson a box of tissues. The camera focuses on her wiping her tears. When she has settled, she continues.**

**May Wanson:** The night of his disappearance, I had a dream. It was very strange. It was one of those dreams that you can remember vividly, as if it’s more a memory than a dream. I was sitting in James’s room in front of his computer. It was dark, the only light coming from his computer screen. I opened the browser, then the screen turned blue. I heard a static sound, then someone whispered to me. I actually felt the hot breath of someone on my ear in the dream, but I couldn’t understand what they were saying. I stared at the screen for who knows how long, then the words “WE WILL LIVE FOREVER” appeared on the screen, big white letters that stayed there for a few seconds. I woke up after that. I still get that dream from time to time.

**Billy Hernandez:** A few days after James’s disappearance, an official investigation was launched. The whole town helped to search for him, searching in groups led by different police officers. One week of searching and James still hasn’t been found. The first piece of vital information they got came during the second day of the official search operations from Allen Reyes, one of James’s classmates and closest friends.

**This next series of talking head interviews interchanges between Mrs. Wanson and Allen Reyes.**

**Allen Reyes:** We were staying with Mrs. Wanson while everyone else tried to look for James. All of us—our friend group with James—were in the same group as his mother. That day she had broken down in the middle of the street, crying hysterically and repeatedly saying James’s name, so we all took her home and stayed with her for the afternoon. We were all in the living room eating sandwiches that Mrs. Wanson had prepared, when we started talking. Just small talk, really, to try to distract her from the situation. We didn’t know what else to do. But the problem was too big so we would always end up talking about James after every conversation. I asked Mrs. Wanson what he was doing before he disappeared. She said that he had been doing his English essay. This, I found strange, because we were all in the same class, and we didn’t have an essay assignment for English class.

**May Wanson:** My heart dropped to my stomach when Allen said that. James had lied to me, which meant that he had been hiding something from me. James has never kept any secrets from me, so this was really shocking. My hands started shaking, then, from fear, but I didn’t want to worry the kids so I just sat with my hands on my lap, my fingers intertwined.

**Allen Reyes:** I asked her if she knew what he was really doing. If she tried to snoop around or something like that. Then she mentioned James’s computer screen being blue. It was Marco who made the connection. When Mrs. Wanson mentioned the blue screen, Marco whispered about a lesser-known disappearance that he had read online that happened a few months prior to James’s disappearance. This was about a fifteen-year old girl named Patty Daez, who just vanished one morning, seemingly out of thin air.

**May Wanson:** I had never heard of Patty. Apparently it was a smaller case. When Marco mentioned her, I asked him how these two cases were similar. He told us that when Patty’s parents searched her room, her laptop had a blue screen, too.

**Allen Reyes:** That was when something clicked in my brain. Suddenly I remembered something James had told me in passing, so I told everyone in the room about it. A week before he disappeared, he mentioned something about a website called The Blue Corner. It wasn’t a site you could deliberately open on a browser. He said that it only opens randomly as a pop-up ad. He first encountered it when he was trying to watch a movie on a pirated site. It gives you five seconds to close that tab. If you don’t, you won’t be able to close it anymore until it’s done with you. He never did tell me how he found out about it. Basically, the site only appears on a blue screen for a few seconds, then an image flashes on the screen. The first time he came on the site, it was a boy with his eyes gouged out. The second time, it was a naked woman kneeling on shattered glass with her palms raised up, her eyes closed and her lips smiling. James had been terrified during those times, but he said that it felt like an out-of-body experience, as if  someone or something else was controlling him and all he could do was watch.

**May Wanson:** I asked him what happens after that. Allen said that after the initial flash of those disturbing images, the text “YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN” appears. Then another, “IN SEVEN DAYS, THE MASTER WILL CALL FOR YOU. WAIT FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS.” Before the site closed on its own, another image would appear only for a second. It was a picture of five people dressed in white bloody robes, their faces hooded but they were all staring at you through the screen.

**Allen Reyes:** At first James just tried to shrug it off, dismissing it as a joke. He thought it was kind of like those viruses disguised as an announcement that you’ve won cash or a brand new phone. The internet has an endless amount of those weird websites. After he told me about The Blue Corner, he never mentioned it again, and I never asked him about it. Like I said, he didn’t think too much of it.

**Billy Hernandez:** After the discovery of The Blue Corner, May Wanson informed the authorities about this alleged website. Together with her, they tried to access this corner of the internet, following the information Allen Reyes had said about the site being a pop-up ad. Unfortunately for them, after a week and a half of trying to get on The Blue Corner, their efforts proved futile. By then, the authorities had made the possibility clear to May: that there was barely any chance of finding James, and if they did, they would only find his body.

**May Wanson:** I was angry, of course. Two police officers knocked on my door one morning and told me that my son still hadn’t been found. They told me that he was probably dead. I was angry, and I screamed at them, told them to get the fuck out of my house and they were useless. I pushed one of them and he fell to the ground. I spit on him afterwards, remembering how they weren’t able to help us immediately, right from the night that James disappeared. To this day, I still wonder if we would have found him had the police agreed to help us look that night. I still lose sleep over it.

**Billy Hernandez:** Things took an interesting turn when someone left an envelope by the Wansons’ front door the next morning.

**The documentary cuts to the actual photos of the contents of the envelope.**

**Billy Hernandez:** Inside was a USB and a human eyeball.

**It then cuts to a reenactment of an actress playing May Wanson opening the door and seeing the envelope. She picks it up, opens it, and screams as she sees the bloody eyeball. She drops the envelope to the ground and runs back inside the house to call the police.**

**May Wanson:** I just knew who that eyeball belonged to.

**May Wanson shakes her head and closes her eyes as tears slide down her cheeks. She begins to sob loudly, her hands and shoulders trembling. She stands up.**

**May Wanson:** I can’t do this interview anymore.

**Producer (off-camera):** Ma’am, we still have a few questions before the interview is over. Once you have calmed down, please return in front of the camera. We want your story to be shared to our viewers.

**May Wanson stares at someone behind the camera, then rushes to them. She covers the lens of the camera with her palm.**

**May Wanson**: Fuck you! Fuck this show!

**Producer:** Ma’am, please calm down.

**May Wanson removes her hand from the lens, and we see an empty chair in front as May argues with the producer behind the camera. At the back window on the left of the screen, a hooded man in a white cloak is looking from outside, unmoving and watching the scene unfold. He stands there until the scene cuts to black.**

**Billy Hernandez:** May Wanson refused to finish the interview. What we will now show you is the footage from the USB.

**They play the footage. It’s a video of the Wansons’ house. The camera is shaky at first as the person holding the camera is trying to get a good angle. In the whole footage, we can hear someone breathing. The video is still for a few seconds, focusing on the house. After some time, James Wanson can be seen opening his bedroom window and climbing out of it. He closes it while crouching above the roof, then jumps down to the ground as we begin to hear a male voice quietly chanting in an indiscernible language. The camera follows James running into the woods across the street. The footage is still for about four seconds, then it cuts to black.**

**The documentary cuts to Dr. Elliot Luna, a linguist.**

**Dr. Elliot Luna:** The man was whispering as he was speaking, so it was quite difficult to make out what he was saying. Once I was able to amplify the recording, I listened to it repeatedly with my colleagues. What the man is saying in the video does have the elements of a language. I could hear some words repeating, which can be prepositions. Certain words end with the same syllable, too, which may suggest that the language is agglutinative, meaning that words are formed by adding more syllables to the word. An example is adding a prefix or a suffix to a word, depending on the tense and definition. However, I can confidently say that this is not a known language. Honestly, I don’t know what this language is.

**Billy Hernandez:** After the video and the eyeball were shown to the police, another search began, with more focus on the woods. Still, no sign of James was ever found.

**The documentary cuts to black. It stays that way for about a minute before it resumes playing. When it does, we can see the host, Billy, sitting in front of his laptop. One of his camera crew is recording the whole thing. They seem to be in Billy’s house.**

**Billy Hernandez:** You have to see this! I was able to get in on the website. Sean, focus the camera on the screen. Here we go.

**We see the blue screen of The Blue Corner”. At this point, multiple voices begin chanting in their unknown language, but Billy nor his cameraman don’t seem to hear it. Billy is staring at the screen. An image flashes: cloaked men encircling a house outside, holding hands, their faces covered.**

**Billy Hernandez:** Wait, that looks like my house.

**A text then appears, replacing the image. It says “YOU HAVE VIOLATED THE MASTER.”**

**Billy Hernandez:** What?

**The text disappears, then a video begins playing. Someone is taking a live video of Billy’s house. They go through the backdoor, through the kitchen, then up the stairs to his room. Billy and the cameraman can only watch. The person taking the video stops outside Billy’s room.**

**Sean (cameraman):** Fuck, dude, I don’t like this.

**The live video ends. Silence. Billy stares at the door. Sean points the camera to the door as well. A beat passes, then the door bangs open. Hooded men enter the room. Billy screams and gets up, but two men grab him and pin him to the ground. One of them sits on top of him, takes out a small blade, then aims it on his right eye.**

**Sean:** Fuck this!

**Still holding the camera, he goes to the window and jumps out. We see him fall to the ground, screaming, then he suddenly stops as he hits the ground, his head bleeding and his arms twisted in an unnatural angle. The camera falls beside him, the lens focusing on his face. Distantly, off-camera, we can still hear Billy’s screams. After a moment, someone’s legs appear on the video. He walks behind Sean’s head, kneels down, then looks at the camera. James begins chanting as he stares at the camera, two bloody holes where his eyes should be.**

**The camera fades to black.**

**To this day, Billy Hernandez and Sean David are still missing.**

*And that was the end of the email. I am getting chills as I write this. I have never encountered The Blue Corner—if it is real—and I hope I never will.*

*What do you think of this, Haunted Fam? Is this real? A hoax? Let me know your comment—*
