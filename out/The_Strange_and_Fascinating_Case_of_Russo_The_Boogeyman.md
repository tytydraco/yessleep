Marc Russo was a good kid when I met him. We go way back. Orphanage days back. We’d been through it all together. Two godforsaken kids with a couple of loose screws abandoned dropped off into hell in the middle fuck-all-country. Neither of us was particularly bright, so when adulthood came, we were sold on promoting freedom to faraway places where oppression was the local currency. Two stupid teenagers were given rifles and told to shoot.

We did, and for the longest time; loved every second of it. Or so I thought, looking back, I don’t think he had as much of a good time as I did. He always seemed a little too on edge, even in Afghan, where you had to be on edge – he was about to snap at every turn. I wasn’t like that; I was a soldier, I felt at home there not because I enjoyed the constant sense of danger or because I liked killing people or because I felt particularly patriotic, nah. That wore off quickly… I felt at home on the front because I had a family there. It wasn’t just me and Marc anymore, and I thought he felt the same.

Fuck knows what he felt, really. Something wasn’t right with him from the start, me neither if I’m being honest. I was never a people person, that’s why I train dogs. Dogs won’t fuck you over, but I digress.

Eventually, Marc did snap, we stormed a spook lair. One of the spooks was a shiekh with one of the dancing boys still on his lap. Russo lost it – blasted half a mag into that old pederast. And while I get it, these are subhumans who don’t deserve to live, he also blasted through the kid. Never seen him express remorse for that. His losing his cool nearly fucked up the entire operation, but we pulled through.

Eventually, the war ended for us and we came back home. Well, I did, Marc died there. Probably in that same moment, maybe at some other point. We’ve done some atrocious things there in the name of survival, but we had to.

I came back home, with many of the boys and with us came back Boogeyman Russo. He was a mess before, but now he was completely fucked in the head. Obsessed, withdrawn, bitter and angry. Some folks sought treatment; therapy is a wonderful thing if you need it. Russo never got the help he needed. Too stubborn, too stupid.

That fucking idiot…

I can shit on him all day long, but to his credit; he found out, somehow, that there’s a local kiddy diddling ring. Smoked these snakes one by one. Lured them out into the light and got them all in trouble with the law. Tactical genius on his part. He’d instigate fights and beat up those fuckers, then get them to court and there the rot would float.

But he wasn’t just dishing out beatings to scum who deserved them; he was maiming them. He wanted me to join in and asked me a couple of times, I shot him down. I was building up a nice life for myself and being a vigilante didn’t sound too appealing at the time.

We drifted apart over time, people change, and priorities shift. I was in a good place, and Russo, he wasn’t fucking losing it. Burning every bridge to fuel his obsessive crusade. Being the Boogeyman didn’t lead to any happy endings, though. He ended up crossing every imaginable line.

Russo ended up putting a nineteen-year-old kid in a coma and accidentally killed his equally legal girlfriend. He begged me to help him get rid of the evidence upon finding out what he had done, but I had none of it. Nearly fucking killed him myself when he put his hands on me for refusing to help.

Funny how that turns out, isn’t it?

He thought the guy looked a little too old and the girl a little too young. Thought it was another one of those dirty cretins.

Russo ended up behind bars for that little stunt. Twelve years. That’s all he got. Good standing in the community, a vet, a hero even! He cared about the children they said, I remember, what a load of shit. Well, I moved on, even if he was my brother, he fucked up his own life. I stopped visiting him after he started rumbling borderline Satanic nonsense at me.

He got out, and no one was there to meet him, not even me.

That might’ve been the final straw… But who knows?

In any case, one of them rainy nights I get a text from fucking Russo. A simple text; “We gotta talk, man…”

It’s been twelve years; What the fuck? How bad could it go? I thought to myself… Well… It went fucking brilliant.

Come over to his place. It looks rundown. T’was expected he was a loner who hadn’t been home for over a decade. Smelled like a dead horse’s worm-infested ass. I knocked, it’s dead silent, I knocked again – still fucking silence. Instincts took over for a hot second and I pressed the door handle; somewhat uneasily. Again, what the fuck could go wrong? It’s my man, my brother, my terror twin, for fuck’s sake.

Well, yeah, terror is apt in this case. The place was devoid of all life. A cemetery.

A literal cemetery.

The first thing I see there is this naked lady on the floor.

Dead.

Flies all around her – blood stains all over her body.

Illuminated by the frosty steaming moonlight.

Then I see Russo – the boogeyman himself.

Looks like shit – smells like death.

And I’m back on the battlefield.

Chills run down my spine, muscles tense up, and I am afraid.

The whole thing is fucking wrong.

It’s him, but it’s hardly human now. Bandaged bloody mug, gnarly cuts all over. Hands gone – replaced with deer hooves – crudely bandaged to stumps.

Fuck he wrote that message to me?

Time crawls to a halt and before I can even curse out the seemingly dead boogeyman, I see it, a pink school bag tossed aside. It’s still got textbooks in there. My stomach knots and the room begins to spin.

What have you done, Russo, you motherfucker?

I see his hunting rifle and then he makes the fatal mistake of being alive. His pained moan killed any sensible thought I might’ve had in between my ears. The fuck this thing is still breathing? How? It all happened so fucking fast. I grabbed his rifle and instead of shooting him – I swung like a mad fucking man. Cursing out this sack of shit as I batter his brains in. All the while, I am terrified of the possibility of him somehow getting up and fighting back.

He’s just lying there, softly whimpering until he stops and eventually, I did too.

I just spat in his bloodied face and stormed off when he stopped moving.

That fucking image of a mangled chimera stuck in my mind for a long while. I can swear I saw it lurking in the darkest corners of my house for a bit. Just standing there, staring at me. Fucking with my head.

Shit’s been rough for a time… yeah… I guess I need therapy too…

Russo’s dead…

Should be dead… I spilled his brains all over his piss-covered floor.

But I heard last night in the news about a strange faceless figure with hooves for hands chasing young couples through the woods, shrieking and howling for the last couple of weeks now. Shit.

Fuck, just thinking about it puts me on edge. It shouldn’t be him – it can’t, can it now?

He’s supposed to be dead – his fucking brains were out.

I saw them…

Just like in Afghan…

Rusty red chunks on the floor… I know what his brain looks like…

I’ve seen it before…

Should’ve shot the motherfucker on sight, didn’t I?
