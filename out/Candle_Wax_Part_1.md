Should I have stayed in Toronto? It’s the question I keep asking myself. If I knew what would happen when I moved to Greenwood, I’m sure I would have stayed as far away as possible. But if I had the chance to erase it all now, would I? I would be happier if I didn’t know what was out there, but it would be a lie.

 

Is having my eye open worth being forced to sleep with it open?

 

At the end of the day, it’s my job. It’s the life I chose, and I regret nothing about the life I chose. I believe that secrets, especially the darkest ones, need to be brought to light. So this is me, bringing them to light.

 

Journaling was a therapy thing at first, but it quickly became useful as a detective. Sorting feelings from facts, compartmentalizing, keeping things from getting personal. Its success rate varied. But in this case, it was a tool for compiling the events of last summer as I experienced them.

 

As of today, as I begin recounting that long waking nightmare, my birthday was three days ago. I got a t-shirt. Women’s medium. A replacement of one I lost. On my birthday last year, the only gift I got was from me to myself. That gift was moving to Greenwood. A place I had always loved, ever since visiting as a child.

 

I drove up there in my car on a sunny Tuesday morning. Daniels, my partner for two years in Toronto, followed me in his pick-up truck with all my furniture. I accumulated a fair few favors from the man in those two years and it was time to collect.

 

The air got better. The roads got worse. As I reached the first stretch of prairies, I knew I made the right choice. It was gorgeous. I drove with the windows down for hours and hours. I had made a whole new-wave pop-rock playlist for the road, but it turned out I didn’t need it. I just listened to the crashing of the wind, and I was happy. Even the smells made me smile. I’d take fresh farm manure over street pigeon shit any day.

 

We arrived Wednesday night and Daniels was off by Thursday morning. No emotional farewell, just a handshake and a “good luck” – and there I was. Home, in a one-bedroom basement unit of a six unit building. It was quaint, modest, and a damn sight cheaper than Toronto. Mrs. Fredricks, the sweet old landlady swung by and was about as stark opposite from my old landlord as you could get. She even offered to help me unpack.

 

“It’s always good to get it done right away.” She said. “First you put it off one day, then you put it off one week, then before ya know it it’s two years later and you still got these damn boxes layin’ around.”

 

“Yeah, I know what you mean.” I replied, trying to match her friendliness to the best of my social ability.

 

“Do you have more stuff coming, or?” She inquired.

 

“No, this is it.”

 

“Wow. Light packer, eh?”

 

“Yeah... It’s easier that way, I suppose.”

 

“What is it you do for work, hun?”

 

“Oh I’m uh... I’m an RCMP Detective. Just transferred.”

 

Mrs. Fredricks’ eyes lit up. I might as well have said I was in the circus.

 

“Really? That’s fantastic! Well, I tell you what, I feel safer already.”

 

I expected to receive some big reactions like that. I didn’t exactly fit the rural law enforcement phenotype. But I was thoroughly charmed by her comment. She gave me a hug and told me to come see her if I needed anything. It was a warmer welcome than I could’ve asked for.

 

Unpacking was going to have to wait, though. As would sightseeing and all else. I got my bare essentials out and ready, and then I had to prepare for work in the morning. No rest for the wicked.

 

Maybe I would have savored the day more if I had known it was going to be my last happy one. Before it all went to hell. Before the case, the nightmares, the girl who wasn’t missing... before Candle Caine.

 

I woke myself up two minutes before my 5 AM alarm that day. Maybe it was the nerves. I was usually better about managing that sort of thing. In any case I was glad to wake up to silence. A little nugget of peace before the work begins.

 

The easiest way to ease nerves is to just stick to your routine, so that’s what I did. Starting with 15 push-ups, 15 sit-ups, 15 lunges, 15 squats, and three 30 second planks. Then stretches.

 

The sun had just begun shining through the blinds of my bedroom, casting deep orange lines against the far wall. In a way, it made it not look quite so bare. I made a mental note to make time to unpack more as soon as I could.

 

I showered, I brushed my teeth, and applied a trivial amount of make-up. Concealer and some mascara mainly. I typically wouldn’t bother but first impressions are important.

 

I didn’t have a chance to meal prep, but I had enough foresight to unpack some granola bars and coffee. It would do for now.

 

I left the apartment before 7 and arrived at my new HQ 10 minutes later.

 

“Hello miss, how may I help you?” The receptionist greeted with a smile and a drawl. She was teetering on elderly but not quite retirement age yet.

 

“Hi. Detective Cole, I’ve just transferred here. I’m to speak with the Chief Inspector, I believe.”

 

“Oh, Miss Cole... We weren’t expecting you ‘til 8.” She responded, still sounding chipper.

 

“I can wait if you like.” I offered.

 

“Oh no, he’s not doin’ nothin’.” She turned around and began shouting, “Favret! I got Miss Cole here!”

 

Sure enough, out from the door in the back stepped a large man in a shirt and tie, brandishing a less enthusiastic smile then the receptionist.

 

“Cole! Right this way.” He said, gesturing me to follow as he held the door open.

 

We walked down some halls and past some cubicles. Functionally it was fairly similar to my previous employment, aesthetically it was far less so, but that was to be expected. The atmosphere was unkempt but homey. It was less clinical, less industrial, and I liked it. My first impression of my coworkers as I passed them was “lackadaisical.“

 

The Chief Inspector led me into his office where he sat behind his desk. He gestured for me to take a seat and I obliged.

 

“I’m Chief Inspector Favret, we’ve spoken on the phone. Welcome. How are you liking Greenwood so far?” He asked, somewhere between stilted pleasantry and curt.

 

“It’s uh- it’s great, sir. Very peaceful.” I answered with a somewhat forced smile.

 

“Bit different from Toronto I reckon.”

 

“Yes, sir. Big change.”

 

“Well, that’s alright. I know you’ll get used to it... It’s not all hicks here, you know.”

 

I forced a light chuckle in response. I couldn’t help feeling a subtle but immediate tension in the air. Either he was judging me, or he assumed I was judging him. Maybe both.

 

“I mean it.” He continued. “You may be the only... lady... we have here, but lots of folks come over from the big cities. You’ll find many a kindred spirit I’m sure. In fact, your new partner was a New Yorker.” He explained.

 

“My new partner?” I questioned, suppressing a small cringe at the way he said ‘lady’. Though, his cadence also made the words ‘New Yorker’ sound like an exotic animal.

 

“Oh yeah we got a spot for you, don’t worry. His recent partner quit, and he’s working a new assignment. Small stuff, easy start. So you’re gonna shadow him for a bit, and he can show you how we do things here. He’s been here a long time, so you’re in good hands.” He said with utmost assurance.

 

“Sounds good, sir.”

 

“Fantastic, I’m gonna leave the rest to Wally, you’ll find him out there. Big white guy, beard, greying a bit. You’ll know him when you see him.”

 

“Thank you, sir.” I said as I stood up and made my way out of the thickened air of his office.

 

Outside among the cubicles I saw quite a few men, standing or lounging around and chatting. Almost all of them were large white guys with beards. Favret couldn’t have been less helpful. I had to use my ears instead. He said New Yorker, that shouldn’t be too tough to suss out in this backwoods place.

 

“No it’s not condensed milk, it’s evaporated milk. Condensed milk is sweetened-“ Not him.

 

“You’ve got a problem man. Two hundred dollars? What was it last time-“ Not him.

 

“That’s what I’m saying. No. It was overtime and he’s got the puck-” Definitely not him.

 

“Bro I swear to god if you call them Uggs one more time-“ That’s the guy.

 

I waited for him to finish his somewhat hostile conversation and then I approached.

 

“Uh excuse me, are you... Wally?”

 

The man turned his head towards me with a scowl. He was a husky man. Tall, a little overweight, but he looked sturdy. I’d compare him to a fridge. He appeared to be somewhere in the early to mid 40s range, grizzled, with a messy beard and an unkempt undercut that was greying on the sides. He had a nose that looked like it was best friends with a baseball bat, its bridge winded like a country road. His eyes were dark and piercing, with surprisingly full lashes, though I wasn’t going to tell him that.

 

“The fuck did you say to me?” He snapped.

 

“Oh, I’m sorry. I’m new here, the Chief Inspector told me-“

 

“Yeah, yeah, new girl. He was sayin’ about that. Alright first of all, it ain’t Wally. That’s not my name. It’s Detective Gray, show some respect.” He said, about as prickly as humanly possible. The New York accent wasn’t front and center, but it was definitely there underneath all the gruff.

 

“Sorry, Detective Gray. I’m Detective Cole, nice to meet you.” I said attempting to remain cordial and friendly as I extended my hand.

 

“Psh.” He dismissed, rejecting the handshake. “You been briefed on the case, yeah?”

 

“Uh... I have not. Favret told me you would brief me.”

 

Gray chuckled and seethed, “Course he did... I’ll catch you up in the car, let’s go.”

 

He stood up and walked and I followed. I knew instantly he was going to be a pain in the ass to work with, but it wasn’t too dissimilar from people I’ve had to work with before.

 

The rugged street punk from New York turned backwoods detective vibe threw me for a loop though. Beneath the harsh unpleasantness I was feeling, I was fascinated by him. What brought a guy like him to a place like this? Was it the same thing that brought me here?

 

We walked to his car. It was an old tan shitbox of some variety. Looked like it was from the 70s. I hopped in the passenger seat and he hopped in the driver’s.

 

“Let me ask you somethin’... Cole, was it?”

 

“Yeah.”

 

“You’re young, right? You’re on that TikTok and shit?”

 

“I’m not on TikTok, no.”

 

“But you know about all that right?”

 

“...A little bit?”

 

“Well, alright, doesn’t matter, so here’s the deal. Not to disappoint you on your first day but this case ain’t shit.” Gray explained. “Mother tries to file a missing persons for her daughter, she’s been gone eight weeks, whatever, right? Turns out she ain’t missing at all because we check her, uh, “socials” and she’s in Paris on a vacation that her mom knew about the whole time.”

 

“Really? So, why is this a case at all then?”

 

“It’s not. She’s a nut. Her daughter posts these vlogs or TikToks daily – apparently she’s even got a big following – all from Paris talkin’ bout how great it is eating fucking snails or whatever. But the mother still wants to file the report anyway. She won’t let it go.”

 

“Interesting.” I answered.

 

“Annoying.” He countered. “So we’re going to see her, and hopefully put a pin in this whole thing. That’s about it. Any questions?”

 

I shook my head.

 

“Great, I wasn’t gonna answer ‘em anyway.” He quipped as we pealed off from the parking lot.

 

The drive was quiet and I felt the urge to ask him some basic questions. I didn’t care to be his friend, or to really know him on any level, but I needed this friction to ease up at least a little bit for my own sanity. I started with a softball.

 

“So, you’re not from here?”

 

“Ha! Detective of the year over here folks.”

 

Funnily enough it was that one response that gave me all I needed to know about him. He was a miserable prick, sure. But he was also a jaw-jacker. A ball-buster. I put myself in a new frame of mind: Don’t take him too seriously, don’t be afraid of him, and try not to lose your cool.

 

“What brought you here?” I asked.

 

He shook his head, “Christ, Cole. You want my life story?”

 

“Well if we’re going to be working together...”

 

He laughed, “We ain’t gonna be working together for long, trust me.”

 

I stopped talking. I guess he was content with the tension for now.

 

We arrived at a modest two story house which I could only assume belonged to the mother.

 

“Just hang back and don’t talk. Hopefully we put this all to bed now.” Gray said as he knocked on the front door.

 

The door opened to a middle aged woman. Likely late 40s or early 50s. She was well put together, despite being a bit dishevelled. A look of deep concern was written on her face.

 

“So?” She spoke, cutting to the chase. “Any news?”

 

“How are ya, Evelyn?” Gray greeted, with a far less rough tone than I had experienced to this point.

 

Evelyn walked away from the door, an unspoken invitation to let ourselves in.

 

“Who’s that?” She asked, pointing at me.

 

“New kid. Showin’ her the ropes and all.” Gray responded. Another subtle way of taking the piss I figured. I guess I had to get used to this.

 

“Great. I’m glad you’ve over here training people while my daughter’s missing.” Miss Lavoy admonished.

 

“Come on Evelyn, you know I take this seriously, but you gotta give me somethin’ here. Make it make sense to me. Harmony’s in Paris. You know that. I know that. She’s not missing. You want her to come home, I get that, but what would you have me do, fly to Paris and grab her?”

 

“She’s NOT in Paris!” Miss Lavoy shouted.

 

Gray pulled out his phone, pulled up a video, and showed it to her.

 

“She posted this TODAY. She’s been posting all week. Look. Freaking Eiffel Tower’s in the background. Why do you think she isn’t there?”

 

“Well maybe she is, but she doesn’t want to be. There’s just... Something’s wrong! You don’t get it! I can’t... You’re not her mother, you don’t know her.”

 

“When was the last time you spoke to your daughter?” I piped in. Gray shot me a look but didn’t say anything.

 

“Last time we spoke on the phone was a few days ago. It’s mostly texting with her.”

 

My interest was piquing. In what way could she be missing if she could take phone calls, return texts, and post vlogs? It sounded crazy but this woman didn’t seem crazy. Distressed, very much so, but not crazy.

 

“And in these interactions, did you notice anything strange?” I prodded.

 

“Well every time I’ve phoned her she hasn’t been able to talk long. She always says she’s busy and she ends the call quick. I call her later and she says she’s too tired. There’s always an excuse.”

 

“And the texts?”

 

“She’s just... normal. She tells me not to worry. She brushes it off, says it’s all fine.”

 

“So what exactly makes you think something’s wrong?”

 

“I just know! This whole trip was wrong. She never mentioned it to me until a few days before she left, and even then it was by text. I talked to her friends and they said the same thing. Nobody knew about this trip. It came out of nowhere. Then ever since she left it’s like I’m not even her mother anymore. She acts like I’m just another person. She tells me about where she goes and what she does – this restaurant, that restaurant, whatever – but it’s all just... nothing.”

 

“You think she’s hiding something?”

 

“She wouldn’t hide anything from me. That’s not the kind of person she is. This isn’t her. Whoever’s in those videos isn’t her.”

 

Gray stepped back into the conversation, “Why don’t we try calling her now, huh? We can all hash this out.”

 

“Yeah! I’ll call her up now, put her on speaker.” Miss Lavoy responded, pulling out her phone and dialing.

 

It rang and rang and there was no answer. She frowned as we looked on expectantly.

 

“Hang on let me try again.”

 

This time after a few rings, someone picked up.

 

“Hey mom.” A young woman’s voice answered.

 

“Hey sweetheart, are you alone right now?” Miss Lavoy asked.

 

“Uh, yeah, but I’m actually just about to-“

 

“Okay I’ve got some detectives with me here, and I need you to tell us what’s going on, alright sweetie?”

 

“What... What are you...” The voice on the phone stammered with embarrassment.

 

“Hey there Harmony.” Gray spoke into the phone. “Listen, your mother’s worried about you and we just wanna make sure everything’s good over there, alright?”

 

“Oh my gosh...” Harmony exclaimed with irritation. “Mom I told you everything’s fine! I don’t know what you’re so worried about! I promise I’m more than okay. I know I extended the trip, but I just wasn’t ready to leave yet! I’ll be home in just a few more days.”

 

“Harmony, are you sure nothing’s wrong? You have nothing to tell us?” I prodded.

 

“I’m so sorry about this. I promise there is nothing going on. I just wanted to go on a trip and see the world. My online business kind of took off so I got some money and it just felt like the right time. I’ve never left Nova Scotia before so it was a big step... Look I’m sorry, I gotta go. Is there anything else I can help you with?”

 

“No, that won’t be necessary, thank you.” I answered.

 

“I’ll see you soon, okay mom? I love you.” Harmony said before hanging up the phone.

 

Gray shrugged and threw up his hands, “So... She seems perfectly alright to me. You’re worried about your kid being far away from home, I get it. But everything seems fine here. There’s nothing for us to do.”

 

Evelyn just sighed deeply and shook her head. She was clearly trying to articulate some kind of protest but couldn’t find the words. Unfortunately for her, Gray was right. There was nothing for us to do. We left shortly after.

 

“What did I say about not talking?” Gray said as we walked back to the car. I had a feeling he would be sour about that.

 

“Sorry.” I remarked, not hiding my insincerity.

 

“Yeah, yeah. First day, already not taking orders. Good shit.”

 

“I wasn’t aware you were my superior.” I snipped. My impulses got the better of me.

 

Gray laughed. “Are you always this charming?”

 

“That depends, are you always a moody prick?” I may have overstepped.

 

Gray smiled through gritted teeth, “Let me let you in on a little secret, Cole. You know why you’re partnered with me? It aint cause we’re both “city folk.” It’s cause they don’t want you here. You can have your guess as to why that is, but that’s the fact. The sooner you figure that out and just quit, the better it’ll be for both of us.”

 

I suspected he was probably right about that. But it changed nothing.

 

“I’m not quitting.” I answered, getting into the passenger seat of his car.

 

Gray got in the driver’s seat and shot me a “we’ll see” look.

 

“You may want to reflect on why they thought making you someone’s partner would be the best way to make them quit.” I added.

 

“Oh I know why.” Gray answered. “Because I’m a moody prick.”

 

The rest of the day was uneventful and more than mildly unpleasant, but I felt better having had that little spat with Gray. At least we each knew where we stood. I got home to my dark basement apartment, relieved to be done with it for now.

 

Yet, I couldn’t stop thinking about the case. It was essentially closed after today, even though it had barely been open, but still it nagged at me. I had questions. I wanted to know more, I wanted to see more.

 

I unpacked my laptop and sat on my bed. I pulled up all of Harmony’s online profiles just to see if I could find anything. I wasn’t the most social media savvy person in the world, but I had to have a look.

 

The first thing that jumped out at me was the number of followers. Gray wasn’t kidding when he said she had a big following. She was in the high tens of thousands, encroaching upon the hundred. For a small town girl, that must have been quite impressive.

 

On the phone she mentioned an online business. I had a feeling of what that meant based on how awkwardly she said it in the presence of her mother. Her public profiles made no mention of it, but a minute amount of sleuthing led me to alternate profiles. Instantly adorned in racier photos. Links in the description to various Not Safe For Work subscription services. Pinned posts detailing the content she offered. Fair play to her. I wondered how she broached the subject with her mom. Her mom seems a more uptight and conservative type. It wouldn’t surprise me one bit if she kept this side of her a secret.

 

My new initial thought was that this Paris trip wasn’t just a vacation and it was instead some kind of collaboration. She networked with other NSFW creators, and went down there to make more content for her fans. That explains the shifty behavior, she obviously didn’t want her mother to know. That all adds up. Case closed.

 

But I wanted to try one more thing. Just to dot the I’s and cross the t’s. Directly compare a vlog from Paris with one made before. See if there were any discrepancies in her behavior or anything else that might indicate some kind of change. I chose the first vlog from Paris, and a random one from a month earlier with a similar thumbnail.

 

To my naked eye, the videos themselves looked innocuous enough. Her mood and attitude appeared the same. I moved to the descriptions and they were both formatted similarly. She replied to a few comments and spoke the same way on each. Similar verbiage, use of punctuation (she likes using double hyphens and the letter u instead of you) it all seemed to check out. Location services confirmed Paris as the location of the post, as if my eyes weren’t enough to see. It was airtight.

 

I went through a few more of her videos, at this point just because I had nothing better to do. It was all relatively the same. Talking to the camera. Sightseeing. Standard stuff. She spent one of the nights in Belgium, that was mildly eventful I suppose.

 

Videos before the trip were similarly standard. Some unboxing videos, some trends, some general vlogs. It wasn’t really my scene, but I could see why people liked it. There was a coziness to it. The crude comments gave me some insight into the ulterior appeal of it as well. She was, after all, very pretty. I was a bit envious of her blue eyes. They were very bright blue and piercing, almost hypnotic. Mine were closer to her mother’s, a dark greenish hazel.

 

Harmony seemed like a happy person. Always smiling, always chipper. I couldn’t help but feel it was a bit hollow. Which I can understand, it’s a social media persona. You play it up for the fans. Though there was a sincerity in her older videos that I felt was lacking in the Paris ones. Maybe the passion wasn’t there anymore, who knows.

 

All I knew was it was time for me to go to bed. This case was closed. It was time to empty my mind of it and prepare for the next thing Gray would drag me to.

 

The second day on the job in Greenwood went by monotonously. The case load in Toronto versus the case load here couldn’t have been more different. In Toronto we had plenty of local police to handle the small things so we could focus on the multitude of larger, more dangerous issues. Greenwood only had us, but also Greenwood only had about 5,000 people.

 

Gray wasn’t much less unpleasant this day either. He gave me shit about just about everything. I worked on remaining stoic to the best of my power. I wasn’t sure if he hated me, if it amused him trying to get a rise out of me, if he was trying to make me quit, or if it was just his personality. Either way, I would ignore it and carry on with the mundanity.

 

It wasn’t until the day after that something else noteworthy happened. More than noteworthy, in fact. It was still early in the morning. A call came in about a disturbance at the local soup kitchen. They said a homeless man was causing a scene. Raving and ranting, and waving a knife around. Gray and I were close, dealing with a petty larceny – far below my pay grade, but such is the job. We went to the scene.

 

“Blessings” was written in blue italics on a white banner hanging on the front of a rickety little building that was also painted white. There were crosses on the windows. It looked like a house or a small school that had been refurbished and repurposed. Such was the case for many places around here.

 

The shouting was audible from outside, as were the sounds of metal clattering. We made our way inside swiftly.

 

A raggedy older man stood with his back to the near corner of the cafeteria seating. He held a butcher’s knife out at arm’s length, god knows how he got it, while the terrified volunteer staff circled him from a distance with their palms out, attempting to show that they mean him no harm. His eyes were bloodshot and bugged out. He was screaming nonsense.

 

Gray and I took control of the room. I stepped out in front of the staff while Gray backed them off. I looked the man in his bulging eyes, attempting to decipher his words before offering my own.

 

“It’s in me! It’s in me! They poison me!” He screamed.

 

“Sir, I don’t think anyone’s poisoning you. Let’s put down the knife, okay? Let’s talk.”

 

“NO! They want me to do it, but I won’t do it! No more! It’s the bees stinging my brain! They all serve the queen! I won’t be their bee! They can sting and sting! They can suck the pollen out! They can eat me like a bug, but I won’t! No more poison! Burn it all! Melt it all!”

 

I’ve heard some insane rambling in my time but that was up there. I needed him to calm down.

 

“What is your name?” I shouted through his babbling.

 

“My... My name? You want my name!? Why!?”

 

“Because I want to talk. That’s all. Just talk. What’s your name?”

 

“It’s... It’s Melvin.”

 

“Okay, Melvin. I’m Detective Cole. Now I need you to take a breath. You don’t want to hurt anybody, do you?”

 

“No... No... I don’t want to hurt anybody.” He said shakily. I took one slow step towards him and he allowed it without protest.

 

“Good. So just give me the knife, and we can figure this out. I can’t help you if you’re pointing a knife at me, you understand?”

 

“It’s not me... it’s them! It’s everyone! Soon it’ll be everyone! Melting in the dark! I see it! I see the horns of Satan himself, but it’s a lie!”

 

“Melvin, deep breath.” I instructed. “I want to help you but, see, I’m new here. I’m from the city. So I don’t know what you mean when you say these things. Can you just hand me the knife and then explain everything to me calmly?”

 

Melvin didn’t budge, but his hand shook and he began to sob. “You don’t understand... An eye for an eye... The window is open... The father...”

 

“I’m sorry?”

 

“And the girl... she’s not missing.”

 

Those words caught my attention for some reason. They were too specific. Too directed.

 

“The girl?” I asked.

 

“She’s not missing... but she’s gone.”

 

“Who? What do you mean?”

 

“One eye missing, one eye gone. One eye open, two eyes closed, third eye open. Melting, melting, melting, melting...” He raved in manic whispers.

 

“Melvin...”

 

“Won’t be me. Won’t be me. Pluck it out. Stop the sting. Drink, drink, drink. He’s coming here, I’ll go there. He’ll walk again, but not in skin. Never skin. The holes don’t have eyes but they will. They will be his not hers. Hers will be missing but she will be gone. Gone from her skin. Lost in her eye.”

 

“Melvin, look at me.” I said, taking another slow step forward.

 

Melvin did as I asked and stared into my eyes. He took a deep breath and uttered “I now belong to Candle Caine.”

 

In one frantic motion, he turned the knife to his own throat and closed his eyes tight.

 

“Don’t!” I shouted as I sprinted towards him, but it was too late.

 

He plunged the knife into his throat. Instantly blood poured and belched out from the wound. I did what I could, but it was in deep. All the way to the hilt. He shook, convulsed, and gurgled. Then he was gone, and it was quiet. The worst kind of quiet.

 

The ambulance came and took his body. Gray and I stuck around to take care of the traumatized patrons and staff. A man came up and introduced himself as the owner, Mr. Whitley. An older, gangly sort of man with a wisp of white hair. We questioned him briefly.

 

“Did Melvin come around here often?” Gray asked.

 

“Yeah... Yeah he did, he was one of our regulars. Never seen him act like... I mean... I don’t know...” Whitley said, in a somber shellshock.

 

“Did you know much about him? Did he have family here or anything?”

 

“He used to always talk about his niece, Annabelle... I don’t think she lived around here though. He didn’t like to talk about himself much. I imagine he just fell on hard times. It’s rough out there, you know?”

 

“Oh, that I know. For sure. I mean, shit, I wish I had a place like this back in the day.” Gray remarked, probably trying to quell the dread.

 

“Well... It’s just Greenwood hospitality I guess.” Whitley responded humbly.

 

“Yeah, New York hospitality is a little different... But for real, I admire what you do, lookin’ out for people. You take care now. Call if anything else comes to mind.”

 

Gray definitely had a way with people. A charm, and a disarming sort of charisma. So antithetical to the asshole he usually was.

 

We stepped outside and took in some air. The silence lingered for a while before he spoke.

 

“First time seeing someone die?” He asked.

 

“No...” I answered.

 

“Well... You did alright, kid. Don’t beat yourself up.”

 

The word ‘kid’ aside, that was by far the nicest thing he said to me thus far.

 

“The way he was acting... The things he said...” I thought out loud.

 

“Fucking nuts.”

 

“Yeah but... I’ve seen manic episodes, schizophrenia, delusions, bad trips... I’ve dealt with lots of those in Toronto. This felt different... And what is Candle Caine? Have you ever heard of that?”

 

“No idea. Sounds like a high school mascot or somethin’... Maybe he was trying to say ‘candy cane’...”

 

“That wouldn’t really make sense in context though...”

 

Gray dismissively snorted, “What fucking context, Cole? The man was out of it. He was gone. He stuck a knife in his jugular, that’s the context.”

 

“So that’s it? You don’t even want to look into it? You don’t wanna do your job?” I snipped.

 

“Oh fuck off. We’ll look into it. I’m just sayin’... You know last month there was a graverobbing over in Meadowvale. Just a random, old, unmarked grave. They still don’t know who did it or why, they don’t know dick all. Last I checked they didn’t even know who the fuck the grave belonged to. All they know is some freak dug up a skeleton.”

 

“Okay, why are you telling me this?”

 

“Because sometimes people do weird shit. Sometimes it doesn’t make sense and it never will and we just have to be okay with that. I’m not saying don’t do your job, I’m just saying be prepared to not tie it all in a fucking bow.” Gray explained.

 

I rolled my eyes. To me it just sounded like laziness.

 

“Hey.” A frail and solemn voice called out from down the sidewalk. Another scruffy looking man with an overgrown beard approached us, visibly a few years younger. “Fran told me what happened to Melvin, I was just on my way here... You’re the cops? You saw it all?”

 

“Yeah...” I answered. “Did you know him?”

 

“We... We played cribbage... Nobody else knew how to play. They call it an old person game... He won almost every time. I beat him one time, just one... He was my friend...”

 

“I’m sorry.”

 

“He wouldn’t have... He wasn’t... Ugh... He was saving up. He was gonna buy his niece a gift for her 7th birthday. I kept tellin’ him “you use that money for yourself, you idiot.” But he was so excited, he was clean, it was the first birthday of her life he could actually buy her something... He wouldn’t just...”

 

“He sounds like he was a good man...” I said. It was hard to stifle my heartache upon hearing that.

 

“He was... I’m sorry... Are you okay?”

 

“Me? Yeah. Yeah I’m okay.” I said, taken slightly aback by the man’s consideration. “Are you?”

 

The man let out a deep sigh. “Yeah... It just don’t make sense...”

 

He was right... it didn’t. He walked away, his head hung. I felt for him. This part is never easy. You always wish for the right sequence of words to make it a little bit better, but most of the time no such words exist. You just have to watch as peoples’ worlds crumble, and try to feel secure on the knowledge that you did all you could, even if your brain constantly tells you otherwise.

 

There was a constant urge to dehumanize tragedy, to make it easier to manage. It helps with the job, and it helps life in general not be so crushing. But sometimes the humanity of it all just smacks you in the face. Today was one of those days. Gray and I left shortly after, but I couldn’t get it out of my head. Any of it. It lingered in the air.

 

The girl isn’t missing... I couldn’t help but think of Harmony, but we already knew she wasn’t missing. We knew where she was, and I had a good idea of why she was there. There was no case. He must have meant someone else... but who? And what the hell was Candle Caine?
