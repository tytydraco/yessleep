“Hello… My name is ‘BOY’ and I’m here to show you my family” He said in a monotone way…

We first went to his Brother’s room and I didn’t know who that person was until BOY said

“Oh him? He’s BROTHER, he likes to sell many things in his shop, likes toys, books, potions and etc”

“Hey.” BROTHER said without even cracking a smile…

Weird… I’ve been friends with him for years and yet… not once has I seen him smile one in his life…

Then Me and BOY and BROTHER go and eat some lunch… 

and it was pretty weird… 

considering that the walls of this damned house is tearing and molding like if it has been that for decades… 

until I saw two urns… on the right one was labeled ‘MOTHER’ and the right was labeled ‘FATHER’ but… 

they didn’t seem to have any attention and just ate…

Then I saw a door labeled ‘DO NOT ENTER’ and as I walked to it and put my hand in the handle… I heard BOY yell at me, saying if I was crazy and if I had a death wish…

I’ve never seen him this mad in my life…

Then his mood changes and says we should meet ‘SISTER’…

We enter a room where I see medical devices and life support systems…

BOY goes to his sister and asks

“SISTER, Are you feeling better?”

“Yes…” she replied weakly…

“Do you need any necessities SISTER?”

“No…” she replied weakly

Then we leave her room and BOY takes me to his room where I set up my sleeping bag and sleep…

Then in my dream I saw an orange eldritch being saying “I HEARD YOU…”

And the next morning I wake up and I go to have breakfast… after all my mom is gonna pick me up at 2pm… so I go and BOY is just standing there… he looks at me… and says

“Can I ask you a quick question?”

And then his eyes change… as it widens and pupils unrecognizable and his mouth gone… as he says

“DID. YOU. OPEN. THE. DOOR. TO. THE. BASEMENT?”

And I replied with: “N-NO!”

And he went back to normal and sighed of relief and joked about having to hide another body… 

But then… something happened…

I went to check BROTHER’S room and what I found horrified me…

His Limbs are scattered around the room… Blood everywhere… Organs are ripped off and some had bite marks or signs it has been eaten… there was foam in his mouth and BOY just looked shocked and then he went to sister’s room… she was dead as well…

“My family’s dead… Meaning… I AM THE ONLY ONE LEFT!”

And… The Next Day… I asked my mom to take me to his house… and I went and saw something that horrified me the most…

BOY’S body was hanging from a wall and there was a sharp object… possibly a knife and there was writing on the wall… saying that I’m Next…

What should I do?
