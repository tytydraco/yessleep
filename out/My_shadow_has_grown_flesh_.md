I work very long hours as an EMT in my small town, where shifts can be as long as twelve hours or as short as eight. Most of the time, we work in very small teams and go to tame calls. We rarely get a true dire emergency call; the worst we’ve had was a bad car crash that hospitalized a few people for weeks.

Recently, my partner Rob and I responded to a call from an elderly lady who reported an intruder in her home. When we arrived, 

police were already on the scene. They had given her first aid, and we treated her for a minor cut on the back of her head and some bruising on her spine, specifically at C3 and T2.

What struck us as odd was that she had to be restrained during our care because she was frantic, almost appearing to be in a state of distress. 

She was rambling and repeating words under her breath but Rob and I had thrown it up to high stress and adrenaline.

 We couldn’t get her name initially, but the police later found her wallet, identifying her as Martha H. Karol.

Martha didn’t respond to verbal commands and was hunched over in a fetal position. Despite our efforts—me being a 240-pound guy and Rob, who is very strong and built like a brick shit house—we couldn’t get her out of that position. She had abnormal breathing and became increasingly frantic during the ride to the hospital.

Once we arrived, she finally eased up, possibly due to the tension in her muscles from adrenaline or fear. With she finally laid down on the stretcher, we examined her torso for additional bruising.

 When I lifted her shirt, I was shocked by what I saw—dark bruising, almost black, covering her body. Rob asked if it could be blood seeping from an organ, but I couldn’t tell; I had never seen bruising like that before, not even during training.

While she might have fallen during the robbery, the severity of the bruising was alarming. I understand that elderly people have fragile bodies, but this was unlike anything I had encountered.

After checking her into the ER, I was rolling the gurney through the hospital when she suddenly sprang up and grasped my arm tightly.

 It felt like she was holding on for dear life, her grip was so strong that I felt sharp pain as her fingernails dug into my forearm, drawing blood. I tried to pull away, but she felt like an anchor, and it took several nurses and doctors to help me.

Eventually, she released me, and I was rushed into an ER room for immediate medical attention. It took five stitches to repair the damage, along with strong painkillers and anesthetic. I stayed until the next evening to ensure there were no infections or any further injuries that had been done to my arm.

When I was released, Rob was there to take me home. On the drive, he mentioned something odd that made the entire call even more confusing. He said the police report confirmed there was no break-in—no broken glass, no locks picked, and no doors bashed open.

After hearing this, a deep sense of dread settled in. The injuries on the woman couldn’t have been self-inflicted unless she was severely disturbed. When Rob dropped me off, I slumped on my couch, feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about what had just been revealed to me.  


For the next few days, I couldn’t go anywhere since everything in town required a drive, and I didn't want to risk getting into an accident with only one functioning hand. So, I spent my time trying to do basic tasks like laundry and cleaning, which turned out to be much harder than I expected. 

Rob occasionally dropped by to check on me whenever he could, considering his work schedule, and sometimes he would bring dinner because cooking with one arm was a challenge. We’d have Chinese takeout and fortune cookies during his visits. 

However, Rob often mentioned how much he disliked getting to my house since it’s secluded, with a dirt driveway full of potholes from constant rain. Driving there at night, or even at dusk, required careful navigation.

For the next couple of weeks, I went to the hospital for check-ups to ensure my arm was healing. The doctor said it would take more time before it fully healed, and even longer before I regained any feeling in my hand.

 That night, I took a shower, and as the warm water washed over me, I couldn’t feel anything in my arm. Then, something strange happened. As I shut off the water through the steam, I noticed my shadow lagging behind my movements by a split second.



 I waved my hand, but both my hand and body seemed to lag. I felt like I was going crazy, but after slowly waving my hand for a while, I realized I was just sleep-deprived and loopy from the painkillers the hospital gave me. I went to bed, trying to push the strange experience out of my mind.



At around 3:45 in the morning, I woke up and went to the kitchen for a glass of water, something I often did since waking up in the middle of the night was a regular occurrence for me. As I poured the water, I saw something out of the corner of my eye.



 Living alone and in such a secluded area, there shouldn’t have been anyone there, but I swore I saw a person walk from the hallway into the laundry room.



 I almost dropped the glass in shock. Trying to stay quiet, I set the water down and crept back to my bedroom. I quickly grabbed my Glock 34 from my desk drawer and, with only one functioning arm, managed to load a round into the chamber. Crouching in the darkness with my gun in hand, I hid behind the kitchen counter, aiming at the hallway, expecting someone to appear.



After what felt like hours but was probably only five minutes, no one emerged. I cautiously got up, approached the hallway, and started clearing each room. My heart pounded as I expected someone to jump out at me at any moment, but there was no one.

 

I searched every room, but there was no sign of an intruder—no broken glass, no muddy footprints. I started to question everything. The window where I thought I saw the person was on the second floor, so how could anyone have gotten in? 



I began to feel paranoid and frantic, turning on all the lights and going over every room multiple times. I checked every window and door—no windows were broken, no locks picked, and no doors bashed in. It didn’t make sense.



 I was sure I had seen someone, it felt too real. But deep down, I knew it was probably the sleep deprivation and painkillers messing with my mind. I found myself talking out loud in the living room, still clutching my gun, feeling like I was going insane.



After what had happened that night I always made sure to go over not once but twice so that all the windows and doors were locked like always. But I had to make sure that they were locked for certain, I couldn’t risk whatever happened that night to happen again.  


 After a few days, I went on about my life doing chores around the house but I couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was always behind me just waiting for me to relax and somehow slip up.



 I became so much more paranoid, I never have been a true believer in stuff like aliens and anything that couldn’t be explained hell I never even believed in the paranormal or ghosts I always thought it was just a load of BS and that everything that you saw on the internet had to have been somehow faked or staged.



But after a metric ton of thinking I couldn’t just chalk what had happened that night up to some painkillers and being sleepy for God’s sake. Like I said I don’t believe in the paranormal but as I got up to go inside I noticed that I had no shadow. 

I jumped at the sight and I pranced around almost dancing in a sense as I admired how weird it was that I had no shadow it practically stopped following me and I thought that for a while that I was a vampire of some sort but I came to reality as of what happened in the shower and that night of what I saw.  

Something was going on around here, there had to have been something more to this than what I initially led on to—there just had to be. I went to bed that night and locked my bedroom door and in my room, keeping the handgun right by my side on the nightstand this time in case anything happened.

 But nothing did happen that night, and the next night, and the night after that, even during the day nothing had happened.

I awoke one morning to a seemingly beautiful day, with the sun peeking through the trees and blinds, and the sound of birds chirping nearby. 

It felt like I was in the middle of a dream. I threw on some music and happily made some half-burnt eggs and bacon, struggling to flip them properly with one hand.

 I ate on my porch, basking in the sunlight as I read the news. But then I noticed my phone wasn’t working nor would it turn on either, and that’s when I was dragged out of that peaceful reality and sucked back into my own. It wasn’t real and I realized it was indeed a dream, a dream that didn’t last, I awoke in my room to a total darkness that engulfed my room.

It was dark, too dark to even see in my room. The only thing illuminating the space was my alarm clock with the red numbers that read 3:45 again. exactly like before. As I gathered my senses, I heard the hard rain hitting the window.

 A devilish storm had broken out in the middle of the night, and I was caught in it. There had been no forecast of a storm the night before, but then again our town didn’t have the world’s best weather station either.

 “Jesus Christ,” I muttered out loud as I watched the rain and occasional lightning illuminate the pitch-black sky, revealing ominous dark clouds.

With the dim moonlight coming through my bedroom windows and the bright flashes of lightning flooding the house, I noticed something odd. A huge feeling of uncertainty washed over me, and dread filled my lungs and heart and I felt as though I was almost drowning in it.

 I couldn’t make out what it was, but as the feeling grew, I spun around, scanning my room for anything suspicious. Subconsciously, I reached for my gun but stopped myself when I neither heard nor saw anything out of place, that’s when I noticed in the moonlight I had no shadow again.

“Jesus Christ,” I suddenly heard in a distorted voice, twisted in a range of unsettling vocals. I looked down at the foot of my bed to see a matte black, grotesque version of a human. Half of its body was sticking out from under the bed, the other half hidden covered by the rest of my bed.

 I screamed louder than I’d ever screamed before, terrifying myself on top of the horror I was witnessing. It said “Jesus Christ” again, this time deeper, darker, with more gravel in its voice and louder. I collapsed onto the floor, scrambling away as the creature slithered back under the bed.

As I crawled toward the bedroom door, I realized to my horror, that I had left the gun on the nightstand.

 “God damn it,”

 I cursed myself. Reaching for the light switch, I flipped it on, but as I stood up, I noticed a sharp pain in my ankle. It had been slit open. Blood rushed out of the slit ankle and the skin with an almost razor-sharp cut. I collapsed to the floor again, and when I looked back, all I could see were two yellowish-brown eyes staring at me from under the bed.

“GoD DaMnIt,”

 The creature mimicked my words, its voice jagged and unnatural. Fear overwhelmed me as if someone had lit me on fire. I sat up and desperately tried to open the door, but it wouldn’t budge. By now, I was crying due to whatever was under my bed mimicking my words. Trying frantically to get the door open while glancing over my shoulder to see if the creature was coming after me.

After several attempts, the door finally gave way. I practically crawled out of the room, screaming and sobbing, slamming the door behind me. But as I closed the door, I got one last look at the creature. It was still watching me from under the bed, fixated solely on me, tracking my every move like a predator stalking its prey.



As I crawled out of my room while bleeding soaking my wooden floor with my blood turning the once oak stairs to a dark red and covering myself in the same pool of it I got up to my feet and finally was able to at least hop, to my kitchen where I kept a first aid box. 

I threw it open spilling some of the contents on the floor and getting some of it soaked in the blood that turned some of the gauze from snow white to red the cut must have slit the artery above the ankle.

 I threw on a tourniquet and with all my might I tightened down the strap and then forcefully and painfully I don’t want to admit it but I shed tears, as I bore down as I turned the windlass until I couldn’t anymore with all my might almost blacking out in the process. 

The bleeding eventually slowed down and I was able to quickly patch up the wound wrap it with gauze and bandage and treat it with some disinfectant. 

It wasn’t perfect but it was what I had and it would have to do for now. It still hurt like a son of a bitch (obviously I thought to myself) I could hear whatever the hell was in my room stirring awake now and was still in my room and it was starting to move and I don’t think it was coming to give fucking hugs either.

 The boards of the house cracked and groaned so whatever was in there wasn’t light by any means. My keys to my car were in the room as well, so there wasn’t any escaping unless I wanted to limp for five miles and possibly get my wound infected and die in the cold and rain along the way.

 I grabbed a flashlight as I made my way to the downstairs of my house, as I was going to try and hide from it.

 I limped my way down the stairs and into the bottom part of my house and I made sure to not turn on the lights as I didn't give away my hiding spot. I settled on hiding in the guest bedroom, locking the door behind me and turning on my flashlight.

 I sat there listening to whatever the hell was in my room move around and groan with a freakish noise as it moved around the house. It tried to speak a few times but it just repeated the same phrase saying

 “God damnit”... “God damnit” 

In this things fucked up voice in almost a whisper and shout at the same time, it reverbed throughout the house bouncing off all the walls and windows and into the bedroom I was hiding in. 

What went from heavy sounds of footsteps as if someone was marching around to what I can only describe as wet mushy clomps hitting the floor and almost sounded like if you were taking the insides of a watermelon and a pumpkin and squishing them with your bare hands.

 I was shaking with fear paralyzed by it. I couldn’t move either. This was the most scared I had ever been and he could feel it. 

The realization of not knowing what to do sat with me as I heard this thing roar and roam around the house for hours I hid in my house quietly crying in the corner from what he concluded was a shadow hunting me.

 After it went quiet in the house I decided to muster up whatever courage I had left and I was going to try and escape from this hellish nightmare. I’ve been through worse than this and this wasn’t going to be my story's end, I wasn’t going to die to a monster from hell. 

So with all the bravery in my heart, I stood up and limped my way over to the door and cracked it open to see whatever was out there still.

 It stared right at me,

 it had turned into a ball of flesh and bones. It had no more facial features, all of its matte black color was stripped and replaced with white skin and eyes that looked like they were torn out of somebody’s face. 

There were bones where there shouldn’t, couldn’t have been bones, the ulna was lodged into its ribcage so the arm was just a tube of flesh,

 the rib cage itself was facing out the back had been flipped around and was sticking out halfway of its body.

 I flung myself back into the bedroom once more, the ball of flesh burst open the door and was screaming at me like a child having a temper tantrum. 

“WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME”

 I screamed at the top of my lungs, feeling like I was going to lose my voice in the process. The ball of flesh, bone, and hair responded to me,

 “What do you want from me?”

 I almost vomited at the sound of hearing it spit back my shout into a question at me.

 I quickly swallowed the hot acidic vomit that crept up my throat, as it regurgitated my words back to me. 

The flesh that was dripping and falling off this thing's body as if you left the ice cream out for too long was ever so slightly inching towards me as I tried to hold my flashlight in hand shaking with fear. 

I noticed I had pissed myself in fear as the wetness from my boxers leaked onto the floor, 

“Jesus Christ” 

The thing gurgled and mocked me that I had pissed myself and I wasn’t going to allow it. I got up and without a care for my bloody ankle I charged at this hellish beast and I was going to kill it but that didn’t happen.

 It opened its mouth that had been carved from ear to ear, the teeth that looked like they came out of a mix of a T.rex and a hippo. Where I ran and jumped was directly aimed at the beast’s mouth.

I tried to move out of the way but it was to no use, it’s teeth clenched and I was caught in them, I screamed and thrashed around with one-half of my body in it blood spurting everywhere as I tried to break free but it was no use, the teeth yet again bore down on my shoulder, tightening even more with somehow even more force this time. My flesh split in two as the teeth tore it apart from fat to muscle fibers.

 It didn't care as it chewed its way into me. Then it let go, for whatever reason it had released me from its death grip in its mouth and yet again stared at me only this time I could see the silhouette of it because I had dropped my flashlight in the corner when it attacked me. 

The creature yet again lurched forward and hit me right on top of the head. I then awoke in a chair not bound, but in a chair. With the sun beginning to rise and the forest outside my house starting to lighten up the night sky into a bluish haze. 

I awoke in my living room with my laptop sitting in front of me. Was it all a dream? I very quietly said to myself in the chair. 

“No” 

What I thought had been a dream was a nightmarish reality with the feeling starting to kick back in my shoulder as I looked over to see it torn in two with the shoulder cap being exposed even and with every breath I took my lung pushing out a piece of flesh from inside my chest.

 I tried to look around, but I couldn’t move as I felt disabled sitting there. I noticed in the corner of the living the vile creature still with all of its grotesque features like a teratoma had exploded and had features that of a human and could speak. 

After a minute or two the creature then shifted in the corner but it didn’t move itself, it was moving from the inside and it was trying to molt. First, a hand poked the belly of the beast and then a leg and then the face of something. 

Eventually, it exploded out of the bile creature's belly and it sent chunks of flesh and intestines everywhere coating the walls in a sludge full of meat and bone fragments. The creature that came out had evolved a very human-like appearance almost like me…… 

The realization hit me like a freight train. Everything from its body, tallness, and even skin, had been replicated down to my exact measurements and looks. It slowly walked over to me and put its blood-covered hand on the side of my face, I threw up and projectile vomited all over myself as it patted me on the head and tried to speak to me in its broken English tongue learning ever so slightly 

“It’s okay just relax”

 I tried to shake what were my own hands off of me but it was to no use as my neck, spine, and skull cracked and popped violently, with every move I tried to make. I thrashed around on my office chair with me behind me but as soon as I felt my doppelgängers fingers turn from their hard chiseled hands to sharp and razor claws, I heard my phone ring. 

It was Rob he was calling to check in on me to see how I was holding up. The beast growled in disappointment, I guess it wasn’t a fan of Rob for whatever reason. The creature stared at my phone until it went silent, then it rang again. Rob never was one to just call once, especially in this case where he was giving me a checkup call. Call after call eventually became text after text and the time between them shortened.



My mutilated doppelgänger wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon, and seeing that Rob was now on his way, it seemed like my only way out of this nightmare. The creature turned me around in my office chair of death, “You know there’s no way out of this right?” I spat in its face letting it know that I had made up my mind even if I did make it out of here. 



 As I sat there clinging on to life, awaiting the release of death whether it would be from the blood loss, or the creature that was now growing in the corner, doing God knows what. I heard the indistinguishable noise of Rob’s brakes arriving at the front of the house.

 My body jolted alive once more, with every ounce and microgram of strength I had left within my dying body, I tried to yell for help but all that came out was a shy cry of a whisper for help.

 I could hear Rob call for me from his car, expecting me to walk out of the front door I did. But it wasn’t me, my doppelganger was walking out of the front door to go and do god knows what to Rob.

 But nothing did happen, as I heard the two of them talking outside the mimic perfectly copying my voice. 

But I heard something that gave me a chance for survival. Rob had asked what happened to my arm and that he didn’t see any stitches. My mimic asked him to come inside and he’ll show him what happened. 

“NO DON’T COME INSIDE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON’T DO IT”

 But my screams of silence were to no use as there was no hope I saw myself appear in the doorway without a shadow no less and then harshly swing open the front door walking in smiling at me from ear to ear, like a kid on Christmas day. 

Rob followed closely behind my mimic and what turned into a smile of him expecting to sit down and enjoy some nice hot coffee after a long night on the job, turned into a revolting disgust, as he froze in the doorway and dropped to his knees.

 Rob saw me sitting there half slumped in my chair wheezing for air, caked in blood mixed in with the green vile vomit and waste and with bits of entrails and skin all over me, covering me from head to toe. 

Rob sat there on his knees, in silence taking in the sight of me as I lay there. He slowly got up and shifted over to me closely examining me. I guess he couldn’t tell if it was me or not with all the grotesque fluids and solids on me. 

“Marcus? Is that you?” 

Rob asked in a shivering sheepish voice almost shedding tears. All I could do was slightly nod confirming his suspicion, the only thing he could see was the whites of my eyes behind the thick curtain of blood covering the rest of my facial features. 

Rob reached out to me but a firm hand was then placed on his shoulder. It was my mimic’s hand or more or less my hand, the hand in whole, tightly gripped Rob’s shoulder pressing against his blue cotton shirt that he was wearing for his shift that night.

The single hand then became two and then flung Rob across the living room floor, and he came down with a violent crash putting a massive hole into the wall where his torso hit. Rob groaned with pain as he got up, but my mimic was too fast for him he teleported to him from where I was sitting. 

Before Rob could even get a chance to try and defend himself the mimic grabbed him from the front of his collar like if you grabbed a puppy from his scruff and opened his freakishly large mouth. Saliva and mucus dripped and poured over the sides of the mouth of the creature.

Its teeth were pointy like a doctor’s needle, his tongue was too long for his mouth so it played out the side of his face. The roof of his mouth and not yet fully developed so all that was there in replacement were fibers and muscles that didn’t fully cover it and left gaps that looked almost like the inside of fish gills.

The mimic was about to clamp down on Rob and leave a bloody mess of his head.

“WAIT!”

I had mustered up enough of my breath to say that. The mimic then froze as he was holding Rob in the air. He dropped Rob from his future demise and closed his demonic mouth.

“What? What could you possibly want now in your final moments?”

“How does the taste of lead feel motherfucker”

Rob then pointed to his 45. That he had grabbed from his waistband and unloaded a full magazine into the body of the creature. 

The bullets Rob had fired went straight through the creature’s torso, and a couple through his head. It screamed with an ear-deafening screech which left my ears ringing and almost deaf. The creature slumped and bent halfway over and collapsed to the ground.

Rob ran over to me, in a hurry panic with a state of shock on his face. He grabbed me without question and slung me over his back. As he was carrying me out of the doorway I heard the creature move.

Rob hurriedly put me in the passenger seat of his car and started it. I looked only with my eyes as my neck was still in serious pain to see the mimic standing in the doorway. Rob also noticed and loaded another mag into his sidearm and let loose another 7 bullets.

Most of them hit, the ones that did hit the monster, and parts of flesh ejected from it. A part of the left torso had completely blown off, not due to the bullets but because of the mimic. It knelt and started ejecting even more of its skin.

 It looked like it was ejecting plates or skin armor, what was underneath was an amalgamation of red muscle like if you skinned a human alive and took away the base layer. Smooth dark red muscle moving in unison around the body. Rob hopped back into the car not even wanting to look at what was growing on my doorstep. 

What happened after that I can’t remember as I was either blacked out due to the blood loss I sustained or just unconscious and on the brink of death. But luckily for me according to Rob, he ignored every traffic light and sign to get me to the hospital. 

So as I am writing this and having to recount all the horrific details of what demonic activity sprung in my house to write this, all the advice I have to give you is.

If you’re shadow stops following you

Please don’t ignore it.
