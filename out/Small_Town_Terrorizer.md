Has anybody ever seen the movie ‘Small Town Terrorizer’? My roommate keeps insisting that this supposed movie is the best thing ever and that he would rather be “brutally murdered” than never watch this movie again. 

Recently, I’ve gone down this rabbit hole of niche horror movies, trying to find one that would truly scare me. I asked my horror fanatic of a roommate to give me some recommendations, and he gave me at least a days worth of watch time in movies. One of them stood out; one that didn’t seem to exist at all. The previously mentioned ‘Small Town Terrorizer’.

I’ve gone to many other forums trying to find this. All of them have met me with the same answer. One forum even told me that the director, Johnson Cassius Smithingstone (which I must say is quite a weird name), doesn’t even exist. I thought that maybe my roommate could give me more information on this movie. 

I asked him if he had a physical copy, which he had (to my surprise). I followed him to his room and noticed his wide collection of movies. He had an old video camera sitting on top of the shelf which I could have sworn was recording. I also noticed that he was talking to someone on his computer, someone with the initials of J. S. It was something about flying out to San Fransisco for a ‘collab’. He pulled the DVD case from the shelf. His eyes were wide. He had a crooked, unnerving smile on his face as he handed me the case. The case had a handwritten title and an oddly detailed drawing of me and him holding hands. The drawing of him was faded, while the drawing of me was fresh; as if he had just drawn over it.

Now that I think about it, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him watching this. Or maybe he didn’t want me to. I went back to the living room and popped it into the DVD player. There wasn’t a menu or anything like in most of the other DVD movies that I’ve watched, It just started. 

It started with an intro showing off the cast, like in a sitcom. There were a lot of basic names, but one stuck out to me. It was Jake, my name. The similarities didn’t stop there. The movie’s Jake looked like me too. 

After that, the movie finally started. The first shot was one of a forest; one familiar to me. There weren’t any sounds of nature, only the heavy breathing of the camera man. I hit the pause button on player and turned to see my roommate. The damn smile was still on his face. 

All of this was too uncanny. I recognized myself in the movie, I recognized the forest behind my apartment building, I don’t even want to know what would’ve came next. If I had a mirror then, my face probably would have been as pale as the peak of Mount Everest. 

I told him I was going to go grab a pack of beer from the gas station and got the hell out of there. I did get the beer, but I didn’t bring it home. It’s been two days now and I’ve been living in my car waiting until I’m calm enough to go back. 

It turns out 5 people were killed and 3 were injured that night that I left. One of the witnesses went onto the news and said that the perpetrator was wielding one of those old clunky video cameras. My roommate was among the casualties, found lying naked on the couch with the movie still playing.

If anybody has the balls to look for this movie and watch it in full, I need to know what is on that DVD.
