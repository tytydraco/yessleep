Hello I'm Kate marsh and I'm here to give you the rules for the Blake's house. I'm not going to relive my experience by telling y'all what happened but this I guess is my way of helping who ever finds them self there. So here goes nothing.

Rule 1: as you drive it should be a trailer if not then circle around until it is then pull into the drive way.

Rule 2: the key will be underneath the first step of the stairs. After getting it unlock the door and enter. You may feel a weird presence there but don't worry that's normal.

Rule 3: there should be 3 to 4 cats 1 orange 2 or 3 gray cats. They stay in the house except for one that comes in and out she has a pink collar and is light gray. If not in the house make sure it's her when she wants in.

Rule 4: to identify the right cat look at there teeth,eyes,fur color and there size. (Kate here Sense I'm recounting my story there's no picture but if y'all ever find y'all selfs here then y'all will see and better identify the cats)

Rule 5: there is no attic door. Sense our house is a trailer if you see a attic door make sure it's closed if not hurry and hold it close for 15 seconds then close your eyes and say "there's no attic door" 5 times then open your eyes it should be gone. If it's for some reason still there then go and hide in the cats room for 15 minutes then go back to doing the chores.

Rule 6: your chores. You need to feed the cats, make sure they have water, clean there litter boxes (yes 2 of them),  vacuum the house, dust the house and make sure everything is "normal"

Rule 7: when going into the parents room make sure you cut the light on before the door shut if you don't just exit the room fast, close the door behind you and wait 15 seconds and try again. If the bed is inmade make it up. The pillows go light to dark and should face either outwards or inwards. Then clean the litter box in there. 

Rule 8: make sure there's a crystal in each room of the house if not go back into the parents room a d grab a crystal form the box and place on the crystal holder in the room. If a crystal have turned black and glowing dark smash it with a hammer and replace it and burn the smashed one in the fire place mounted in the wall in the living room.

Rule 9: when I tearing the cat room make sure they haven't pulled out anything form the closest. It's a storage room aswell and they tend to mess with the stuff.

Rule 10: after finishing with the second litter box in the playroom take the bag outside go around back and dumb the stuff into the water hole. Me and the wife been needing to fill it and been using there "stuff" to do it with. Then throw the bag into the trash and head back inside.

Rule 11: there food labeled in the fridge for you to eat or cook. When using the stove make sure it's not smoking. If it start to turn it off and clean it. Then try again. It you fail to clean it make sure the fire is normal if not see rule 12.

Rule 12: fire colors. If the fire is green that's ok it won't hurt you and will actually boost the vitamins and proteins of your meal. If the fire is blue or will make it stay cold and even frost your meal. If the fire red it will cook faster and may even burn Thur the pot or pan. If the fire is yellow or orange it's will act like regular fire. If the fire is clear then get the fire extinguisher and put it out. It may or may not summon the spirit of the anime if your using meat. If the fires black then just leave the house there's no hope for it or our cats.

Rule 13: after eating make sure to put your dishes in the dish water. If the dish washer expands I yo the wall and looks like a mini galaxy underwater is on the other side close the door and wait 30 minutes. If it just expands a few feet then close the door and wait 5 minutes. If normal then just use it regularly (the cascade is on the counter).

Rule 14: if you need a break sit in the recliner. If you feel your being watched just ignore it. If you see a what looks like a flash light shining on the reflection of the TV ignore it. If the room suddenly gets cold just rap your self with one of the blankets on the back of the couch. Of you start to feel scared and or shake try and remain calm and breathe in and out and think of happy stuff the effects will only last around 10 minutes then get back to working.

Rule 15: make sure the vacuum the cat room, the hallway, the living room, the kitchen, the second hallway and the parents room, it should be normal but dobt try to vacuum the rugs cause there get sucked in like a cartoon but if you accidentally do suck one up it's ok it'll just come out your pay.

Rule 16: the kids room. Do.not.go.into.there.room if you hear breathing ignore it. If you hear rattling ignore it. If you hear banging. Ignored it. If you hear faint sounds like a TV on just ignore it. It's not really and not important.

Rule 17: remember to feed and water the cats. There food is in a box with a twist on lid on the kitchen it most twist off left is it twist off right then close it back and go on to giving them water.

Rule 18: there water. Making sure it's not a weird color. If it's blood change it. If it's cyan it's fine its just more purified. If it's yellow it's piss. Change it. If it's briwn take it it's not what you think. It's chocolate just put it in the fridge and replace there bowl (the other blows are on the counter in the kitchen as well). If the water black then dumb it outside in the water hole and toss the bowl in aswell and make sure your hands are clean of the stuff.

Rule 19: make sure each window is showing the same weather if not close each one for 15 seconds and keep trying till they do. Even if it's the wrong weather it only matters that there the same.

The last rule. Rule 20: after leaving the monster will be send by mail if done everything correctly you will receive 700$ and a thank you card. Make sure it's us that returbed home that night if not then I hope you stay say and dint meet another clone. Of you have dreams of our house go seak a thipist just tell them "you house sat for the Blake's" there give you medicine to stop the dreams. If you go back and see our house is gone it's ok we were never hear. If your house start acting like ours did move out and forget your things it's our new house now and we're sorry. With this you are prepared for your job hopefully you enjoy and follow the rules.
