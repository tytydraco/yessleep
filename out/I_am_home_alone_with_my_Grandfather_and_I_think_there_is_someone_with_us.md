The house gets weird when it's just me, and him. There's a family emergency, so my Mom is staying in the hospital, and my Grandmother is visiting her. We take turns taking care of him. He has dementia. My old man is not much company, other than the rare lucid moment where we can have a normal conversation. Otherwise he just babbles on and on about nothing in particular. He also wanders aimlessly throughout the house, humming tunelessly to himself.

Of course we have a Dog; a 9 year old Lab mix. But he spends most days sleeping. It's often so quiet here that even the sound of a pin drop can sound like a gunshot. So when I hear moving around or someone talking, it's enough to make me stop what I'm doing and listen. 

Pop tends not to move around a lot, since he's preoccupied solving puzzles on his laptop in his room upstairs. That and we live next to a busy street near a large college. So there can be a lot of outside noise. Depending on the time of day. However, five out of ten times, when I do hear him move, I can hear someone else move around in another part of the house. Or following along right behind him. Dragging feet, or the thudding of heavy boots? The light brushing of soft slippers? Sometimes it's the soft padding of a child's bare feet. 

Like I said, I've never been bothered much by it. I'd like to think of myself as a logical person. Everything has an explanation. I've always written it off as outside noises. 

But I've never been alone with my old man late at night. 

It's night time when I am writing this, and it's 12:15. Sortly before this I was playing Rust in the living room, and my Grandmother hasn't come home from the hospital yet. I've paused my game to listen. The sounds of bumping and dragging can be heard upstairs. But only when I'm busy playing my game. So it's hard to figure out if it's just the game, or something else? 

The urgent need to check on Grandpa hits my conscience like a truck running over a pothole on a highway. What if he got up and fell? What if all that moving around was him trying to get up? All these horrible thoughts raced through my mind while I hurried upstairs. I swear the floorboards creaked and cracked loudly under each hurried step. The bedroom door to his bedroom was cracked open, and I could've sworn I shut it… 

He should be asleep, but I can hear movement inside. I stop at the top two steps when I hear a woman's sigh. 

Nana wasn't home yet.

I open the door slowly, and the nearby bathroom light shines in. Illuminating the dark room with warm light. I glance from the dresser at the far end of the room, and see my reflection in the mirror that sat on it. Craning my head through the crack, I look right to the bed, and I see his dark shape laying there. I wait until I see his chest rise and fall. He was fast asleep. 

What if he fell and got up? 

"Hey…" I hissed, at a low whisper. 

Nothing. Did I just hear the wooden floorboards creak at the far end of the room? I look, but there's nothing there. Chuckling at myself for being so stupid, I closed the door. But as I did, something happens that sets all the hairs on my neck stand on end. 

"Please, help me…" 

A little girl's voice called from the darkness in the far end of the room. 

Damn me. 

There was no one there. So why is it I heard a little girl? 

I didn't open the door to check, instead I rushed downstairs and fixed myself a pot of coffee and grabbed a smoke. I'm in my garage now, drinking my third cup of coffee. It's nearly midnight, and I can't sleep.
