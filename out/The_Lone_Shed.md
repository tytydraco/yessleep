Trigger warning: Violence, SA against women, and demonic activity

I work at a bank, and we have some colorful customers. Some of them will come in and spend a long time talking to us. Most of them are harmless people, just lonely and in need of human connection. Most of them are harmless. 

We used to have a customer who freaked us all out. She would come in and tell us the most bizarre, crass, and unsettling things. At one point she asked my co-worker if she had ever been raped. My co-worker said that she has not. The customer casually responded that she was once gang raped by ten men. My co-worker took the rest of the day off after that. 
She is definitely addicted to drugs and has been assaulted and sexually abused by men most of her life. 

She also told us many stories about demonic and supernatural activity that she has experienced. One story that stands out to me was about a lone shed on her property. I wrote it off as her just being strange at the time, but later another customer, a farrier, corroborated what she told me about the shed. She hired him to shoe and trim the hooves of several of her horses. He came back from her place pale and visibly shaken. This is what he told me:

While he was shoeing her horses she told him not to go into a lone shed on the edge of her property. He asked why, and she told him that that was her demon shed. He laughed it off thinking that she was crazy. At then end of the job, he joked about her demon shed. She looked at him very seriously and told him that it wasn’t a joke. She then asked if he wanted to see it. He said, “Sure.” What he saw inside the shed chilled his blood. The shed had a dirt floor. In one corner was a rotting mattress, covered with dirt and leaves. Chicken bones (she said) littered the floor. There were manacles hanging from the ceiling and walls and deep “claw” marks on the door and walls. There were no insects or spiders in the building, which freaked him out almost as much as other features of the shed. She told him that sometimes she would lock herself in there when she felt like she was about to be posessed. He never went back to shoe her horses, and she hasn’t been in the bank in several years. The farrier isn’t particularly religious, and he’s a tough guy. But he was terrified of her and her shed. He avoids her to this day.

Her property is around 20 miles from my house, and sometimes when I’m outside late at night smoking a cigar and reading, I think of her, say a prayer for her, for the farrier and his family, and for my family’s and co-worker’s safety, and go back inside leaving my cigar smoldering. Last night was one of those nights.
