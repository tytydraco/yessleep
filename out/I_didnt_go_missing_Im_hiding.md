I wanna start this off by saying, I'm sorry. I didn't warn you. Anyone else, either. To be honest, it never even crossed my mind. I was too focused on *getting away*. To my parents, my friends, my colleagues, my dog, and most of all, to you. 

I'm sorry.

It all started about a year ago. Maybe a bit longer, I can't remember. These days, it seems like I'm forgetting everything. That's no surprise to me.

That was the first day that *those things* were on the news.

It was like an apocalyptic horror-movie brought to life. Giant, misformed creatures, like a mixture between a werewolf and a shadow. They had blood red eyes and faded into the night. You could spot their eyes from a hundred metres away. And if you saw them, they saw you.

And the smallest bite. The smallest scratch. And your transformation would begin.

These things were multiplying, and fast. They couldn't be combated. It took six days for alerts to reach the furthest corners of the planet, and twelve days for a global military treaty to commence.

And it wasn't enough.

These things weren't humans. Bullets would bounce off their skin like steel. The armies served as mothing but giant stacks of feed. In the next three days, estimated numbers went from 1,000 globally to more than 30,000. 

It seemed hopeless. The entire human race put together couldn't stop these things. They were called demons by civilians, and a good number had abandoned their homes to live in more secluded areas.

It seemed hopeless. Until we caught a glimpse of them in the sun.

Previously, they would run away whenever sunrise was approaching. The only time they retreated. It was believed that the armies were doing some sort of damage to them, which is why funds continued, rather than mass evacuation.

But the distorted echoes of agony, as tonnes of shadowy flesh melted into pools of dark blood was enough to make even the strongest soldiers break down. The sounds, they later admitted, would never be forgotten.

This was the key solution. Sunlight. UV light. 

Once word spread out about this, armies began putting together giant beams of ultraviolet light. Tens of millions of lumens.

Pure devastation. 

The creatures would melt in agony from the light, even in the dead of night. This was the way.

It took nine days.

Nine days for the creatures to evolve from this.

Nine days for them to build immunity to light.

Five more days for their numbers to go back to how it was.

This was the last shot, and it failed. Governments broke down, people fled, and the creatures reproduced.

Mass evacuation was implemented. The entire continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa were infested. In four weeks, 2.7 billion people were evacuated. The only time in history. For the remaining people, there was no way left for them.

That was one year ago. Humans went to war with those creatures, and lost. But we were together. After a few months, it felt like life was... Relatively normal. In the night, out of the corner of your eye, you'd swear you saw something. Or you'd hear a leaf crunch out of no where. But there was never anything there.

One entire year, and zero sightings of those creatures.

At the start, the governments put in strict safety measures to prevent any of those creatures from popping back up, but now? Nothing. It had been months since there was any effort.


But I knew. Lots knew. In fact, everyone knew. If those things reappeared, there was nowhere else to go.

It's been thirteen months. I remember now.

Thirteen months since the first sighting.

I never stopped to think, despite all the sheer numbers, despite how many times it appeared on the news, forced to us.

Those who got transformed. How did they feel?

Did it hurt? Was it scary? Was it painless? Blissful, even?

I'd laugh, but I don't think I'm able to anymore.

Really, there was just one thing I never thought about.

How slow the transformation was.

I went into hiding one week ago. After the first sign appeared.

Right now, half my body has already transformed. I'm doing the bare minimum to survive. I know I can't. I know I shouldn't. But I'm scared to die.

No one can find me here. I made sure to erase any trace of my leaving.

Everyone will think I've gone missing. I'll be long gone before anyone finds this note.

I hope, one day, this reaches you. 

I can see the ocean. So vast. Endless, it seems.

To my parents. To my friends. To my colleagues. To my dog.

And most of all, to you.

I'm sorry that I couldn't say goodbye.
