Hi everyone! I’ve finally caught a break and can tell you the rest of my story. It’s been hectic in town recently but we are recovering. I’ll explain more at the end so don’t let me hold you any longer. Let’s return back where I left off.

If you haven't read the first part of my story you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yv5aas/keep_the_lanterns_lit/).

The police from down the street began to release a barrage of hot metal as I saw two more come out from the trees behind Mr. Derricks's house. They stayed at the edge of the path of light coming from the van's headlights which gave them an eerie glow. The one in front seemed to buckle and fall to it’s knees while the other two swayed a little but kept walking. The whole time they were rocking their heads back and forth letting out some of the most inhumane laughter I’ve ever heard.

My little sister was crying in my mother's arms while me and my dad were peeking through the sheet looking at the events unfolding on the street.

“Ohh no,” my dad muttered.

A long black arm reached out from behind another house and grabbed an officer. Before anyone could react it pulled him off his feet and unhinged it’s jaw displaying a mouth full of jagged teeth. With one motion it bit the man in half before he could even process what was happening. Two soldiers turned and began firing at the creature. It didn’t seemed bothered at all because it picked up the man's other half and dropped it into it’s mouth. Three more of the creatures appeared from the other side of the street and cornered two more soldiers. They screamed and pleaded for their lives as they were devoured.

Just as the Trobus were coming down on the remaining four officers one of them pulled out two of those light grenades and set them off. The Trobus finally stopped laughing and let out an ear-shattering shriek that nearly made my ears bleed. While they were wailing the remaining officers piled into their van and floored it out of the street.

After they left the Trobus were walking around picking up the remaining pieces of the deceased officers. My dad was white-knuckling the grip on his rifle as he slumped down against the wall. He looked at all of us who all wore shocked expressions.

“We just have to stay here and keep quiet. Everything’s going to be fine, as soon as the sun rises we’ll be okay.”

My dad kept peeking out the window periodically to see if the Trobus would leave. They slowed their march and looked to be checking out each home. I assumed they were trying to see the residents inside. Our concentration was broken when glass shattered outside. One of the Trobus had broken the Johnson family’s window.

It stared through the new entrance for a moment before lowering it’s body to climb through. The others on the street soon followed until four had climbed into their living room. We just sat and prayed that they wouldn’t find the family in the house. What a wishful thought it was.

We heard banging as one of the Trobus started hurling itself into a door. Screaming rang out through the night accompanied by laughter which was increasing in volume. A window slid open and a woman climbed out of it. Then a man exited as well as I heard the door finally give. The Johnsons were an older couple who had to be in their late sixties. Mr. Johnson seemed to hurt his leg when he tumbled out and had to be assisted by his wife. They were hobbling along when I saw it. A Trobus was making its way around to the side of the house they were on.

A watched on in horror as an arm wrapped around the corner and grabbed Mr. Johnson by the throat. His wife cried out in terror as the man she had been married to for so long was lowered into the creature's mouth. One wet crunch later and Mr. Johnson was no more.

I looked over at my dad who at this point had pulled one of the light grenades out from its case. I knew he was fighting hard in his mind whether or not to open the window and toss it. If he did it could alert the creatures of us, but without it, Ms. Johnson was surely going to perish. A moment later he put his hands to his head and slumped back down behind the window as Ms. Johnson’s screams were silenced.

“I’m sorry,” he muttered to himself and my mother came over and wrapped him up in her arms.

We sat for a little while accompanied only by the light of the moon and laughter from our assailants. Another window shattered in a house down the street as screams once again filled the night air.

“The streetlamps usually kept them away,” my dad began, “we always knew they had some intelligence but this is insane. The only reason they ever got into someone's house was if they saw or heard something, but now it seems more like they are sweeping each house.”

“What are we going to do if they get to this one?” my mother asked.

“We need to leave before that happens,” my dad answered and looked at us waiting for confirmation. We all nodded in silent agreement.

“The hospital or the police station is probably our safest bet. They run off of generators so they should have lights. We were always told to go to one or the other if something major like this ever happened and we needed to regroup The hospital is closer so that’s where we’ll go.”

More and more screams were filling the air as we devised our plan of escape. We needed to first get to my dad's truck which was out in the driveway. This is one of those times when I wished we had a garage. If we couldn’t wait for an opening my dad was going to use the flash grenades to buy us some time while we loaded into the truck. We also had two flashlights. Even though they wouldn’t do much good my dad said one good shot in the eyes would definitely hurt. With a plan in mind, we all crept down into the living room and waited for the right moment.

After a while of waiting with no sign of them moving on, we decided to make a run for it before they got so close that we wouldn’t be able to make it out without being grabbed.

“Everyone ready? Looks like now is going to be our best bet,” my dad said while putting his hand on my sister's head, “Here Tyler, hold onto this just in case.”

He handed me one of the flash grenades and I took off the small gym bag I had on and put it inside. My dad was going to throw one once we stepped outside to give us time to reach the truck. I guess mine was insurance just in case we needed more time.

“Alright let’s go!”

Throwing open the door caused the Trobus a house down to cease banging on the front door and turn to us. My dad raised his rifle and sent a few rounds into the closest one which made it crumple to the ground. He then held the flash grenade, pressed the button, and tossed it.

“Shut your eyes!” he shouted as it went off.

Temporary blindness filled my vision as we raced to the safety of the vehicle. My mother and sister reached it first as me and my father were holding up the rear with weapons drawn. I looked over as the Trobus who were previously blinded quieted their shrieks and began to cackle again as they raised themselves up. Me and my dad made it into the truck and he shoved the key into the ignition. I’m surprised that the gear shifter didn’t tear off as hard as he shifted down to drive.

The tires screeched as we left the driveway and tore onto the street. We drove by houses that were untouched while others had doors or windows broken in. We would pass small groups of Trobus or single ones. All bobbing their heads, laughing into the night air.

“I’ve never seen this many,” my dad stated, “the only other time I know something of this magnitude happened was back in 1915.”

“Something like this has already happened?” I asked my dad while looking out the window.

“The reports I saw said one night there was a massive earthquake and unholy creatures ravaged the town. Nearly half the town was wiped out. We have better practices in town now because of it, but Jesus, it still looks like hell out here.”

We were about a 3-minute drive from the hospital at this point. Rounding the corner I saw an overturned car with blood trailing out from the passenger side. Farther up the road there was another and I swear I saw something crouching behind it. As we got closer I realized.

“Dad look out!”

A Trobus stood up from behind the vehicle and made its way into the center of the road. He tried to swerve but hit the curve and the truck began swaying wildly as we fishtailed before it finally tipped on its side. I must have been knocked unconscious for a moment because when I came to all I heard was screaming. And laughter.

A long black arm reached around the driver's side and gripped my dad’s shoulder. He cried out as the dark pointy fingers dug into his flesh. He was being pulled out of the vehicle by this monstrosity. I tried to think of what to do, it wasn’t going to be long before my father became this things next meal. A lightbulb came on in my mind as I remembered the flash grenade I had in my bag. I reached around for it as I heard more laughter fill the night air. More Trobus were on their way.

I slammed my feet into the front windshield with every ounce of strength I had, my legs buzzing with static. After a few hearty kicks it gave in and I started crawling out. The remaining glass was shredding my forearms as I crawled. Making it out, I saw my father whose shirt was slowly being painted red with blood. I took off the gym bag that contained my last hope for saving my dad. Three more Trobus were making their way over as I pressed the button.

The most beautiful flash of light I had ever seen lit up the night. I never knew how happy hearing a body hit the ground could make me. When the white spots left my vision I made my way to my dad who was lying on the ground gasping for air.

“It’s okay Dad, you’re safe now,” as I said that he raised his now only good arm and pointed behind me.

They were already getting up. I pulled my dad over to the curb to sit up as he motioned me to hand him his rifle. I went to the car and helped my mom and sister out. I pulled the flashlight I had out and shined it into the Trobus that had become a little too close for comfort. It threw its arms up wildly and let out one ear-shattering shriek. It was still walking over as I held the flashlight in one hand and the pistol in the other. My dad was firing from his position on the sidewalk with my mom and sister at his side.

“Get back,” I yelled at the creature before me who did nothing but laugh with his companions close behind.

I kept firing until I heard the click of an empty magazine. I pulled off my bag to get another magazine when an arm came crashing into my chest. I was airborne for what felt like an eternity until I came tumbling back into the earth below. I opened my eyes only for a moment to see my dad pull out his last grenade and fill the night with light one last time.

I woke up in the hospital the next morning with my sister and mother by my side. They were cut and bruised pretty badly but I was so happy to see them alive. I learned that my father was worse for wear and was being prepped for surgery. As I said in the last part he has woken up from his surgery at this point. Would you believe he’s already trying to get back out there to help?

After I passed out from being flung from the road onto someone's yard I learned that my father was the one who held the Trobus off long enough for help to arrive. He kept firing until he ran out of ammo and shielded my sister and mom with his body. He was hit like I was and had a punctured lung and broken ribs. His left shoulder was also ripped to shreds. My mother said they had all accepted their demise when one of the police vans rolled onto the street.

Their headlights were strong enough to make the Trobus back up away from my family. They loaded me and my father’s unconscious bodies into the van and took all of us back to the hospital.

Our town of about three thousand actually fared pretty well all things considered. Especially if you stack it up against the last time this happened in 1915. It is still very depressing to know that 115 of the town's residents are no longer here. I knew that this was a pretty close-knit town, but the sense of comradery has never been at the level I have seen these last few days. I’m also doing my best to help out where I can, but the doctors said I have a pretty serious concussion from being launched 30 or so yards. I’ve been helping prepare meals for people who need them.

I want to thank you guys for your support and kind words in the comments. My eyes have definitely been opened to some new ideas. I want to learn all about this town and try to help them. That’s why I’ve decided against returning to school. My new goal is to become a police officer and help keep the town safe. My plan is to one day figure out how to stop the Trobus for good. That’s all I have to write for now. If something crazy happens in the future I'll let you all know.

Now, all I want to do is protect the town and keep the lanterns lit.
