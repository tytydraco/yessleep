I've been a cold person.
 Now, with my death approaching fast it's the only thing left to realize. It's almost too late to think I shouldn't have talked to my parents that way, screamed at them, shut the door in their face as I left to never come back. 
What I would do to unsee that look, that disgusted look my wife gave me after I coldly admitted to cheating on her 
"you're a monster" 
she said, it only felt like a skin deep wound back then.

 My decisions have been foolish from the beginning, I've never been much of a calculating person, always doing what came to me in the heat of the moment, reacting as if there was no tomorrow. That cost me. Dearly. After all, it's because of my personality I chose this job, and my death 

I'm an explorer. Or at least I was, I'm pretty confident this will be my last job. I say "explorer" but a more honest job title would be "mercenary". I get paid to go where people don't want to go, it was pretty fun for a while honestly. It's hard to deny for the past few years I've been having the time of my life in this job, I was once tasked with investigating the lost city of Atlantis, it's a long story to tell here but it was a blast. Those crazy bastards down there almost killed me once or twice, they're pretty good with guns for an underwater civilization, I'll give them that. 

Long story short I took my current job about 2 months ago. It didn't strike me as anything special, "investigate a cult in the Amazon" read the classified document I received. I'd heard of these guys before, they didn't have a name or anything, seemed to be pretty ancient too. They'd probably be fighting me with sticks and stones. 

After some preparation I was ready to take off. The bosses provided me with a private jet to get to the Amazon, it was a comfortable ride, I guess that's what you get for having these big shot bosses. It took a couple of hours to reach the destination, it was pretty standard, same old jungle as last time, the jet let me off about 30 minutes from where the cult was located. A map and some necessities including a communication method and a diary were given to me.

I started walking, after roughly the 30 minutes I was told I saw it. In the distance stood an ancient structure, big as a pyramid, covered in moss. Standing on top of a hill I was able to see all of it clearly, from what I could tell it must've been at least 2000 years old, and yet apart from the moss everything seemed almost too perfect. I slowly started to descend the hill towards this mysterious structure

The sun had slowly begun to set, this chance encounter had been perfect. Although it may sound like a stupid idea in hindsight cold as I was, I decided to try finding a way inside the building to sleep
