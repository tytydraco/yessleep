I'm a custodian of types for the local mortuary. It wasn't a practice made by experience or one from abundant options. I had wandered into the small town of Achnought in June. A traveler I was, wandering at that, wondering where my next meal would come from. And it just so happens that life events or therein end of, was a good place as any to grab a free meal. Though I did prefer weddings over funerals.

But as the old saying goes, beggars can't be choosers, and I had arrived as they were discussing how to bury the body of Matthew Pernickle. An accountant, a banker? I'm not sure. What I did think though, was how odd they were in describing what ought to be done. As if none of thems ever buried one in or dug one out. They were all townsmen; local, burly, fatherly; and not one had a child who needed to give a proper resting place for a beloved dog or a cold dead hamster? Suspicious, I would have been. Yes. Though susceptible to the hat being passed around, of bills, big bills going down the upturned throat of the mad hat wrought the thought straight out of my head.

"What's the hat for," I asked a man dressed in a black suit.

"To bury the deceased." He paused. "Did you know him?"

I shrugged, "Hardly. Though we've spoken a few words between aisles in town." I added, "Stout man."

The man nodded, "I didn't know him well either. And he was married to my cousin. Always the stoic, Matty was."

I agreed, "Yeah he gave off that impression, old Matty did." I scratched at my neck, "So whoever buries the man, poor Matty, gets to keep the collection?"

The man in the black suit could have chuckled, though stifled it as they were in mourning, "That was the deal struck with the last groundskeeper, were it not?"

"Always," I commented. "Always."

"Say," he swallowed. "I don't think we've ever met." He took out his hand, "Paul McConnell."

I shook it to bees, "Frank. And it's a pleasure in finally meeting you. Though under better circumstances one could have wished."

"Agreed." He paused again, his attention drawn to the whispering men standing next to the casket, and sighed. "I suppose we'll have to draw straws again." Paul took off his hat and beckoned me forward, "Come on, before we're stuck here until midnight."

"Straws?"

"On who will bury Matty of course."

"Right. Straws. Of course." I caught up to him, "Hold on just a minute. What if there were a volunteer?"

This time Paul did laugh, it should have served as a warning, but my last looks had seen the tall hat brimming with green, and couldn't be bothered.

"Who would," he sputtered between laughs, "do something so stupid?"

The cast of eyes drew in our direction. They did not seem pleased at our missing glum.

"What's the commotion Paul," a tall burly man questioned.

"Mayor Hannon, I apologize." Paul whispered to me, "My great Uncle." Before turning back to the men surrounding the casket, "We were discussing. What? In the event of a volunteer."

Several of the men let a smile creep across their face, a few even chuckled. The Mayor was not wavered by either, "A volunteer?"

The way that man looked in my direction, veiled the others in silence. It were almost as if the rest of them took a step back. His glare and patience forced me to feel uncomfortable enough to speak, "I. Yes. It was me who volunteered to bury poor Matty."

"Do you mean it," a young man exclaimed.

One of the men ribbed the lad with his elbow. And the Mayor, never having taken his eyes off of me, tested my resolve, "You've experience in excavation?"

I liked to brag, "I did a stint of mining up north some years ago. Deep, big holes that made a man question the omniscience of God within the pits."

"Big ones," the Mayor asked.

"Oh yeah, giant holes, near straight to the center of the Earth."

A smile spread across his thin lips, and I saw a greedy look appear in his eyes. I've only seen men look at two things that way, and one was gold, the other food. He snatched the hat roughly, I watched as two bills floated out and landed upon the soft ground. "Will this suffice for your services, mister...?"

"Frank. My friends call me Frank." I grabbed the hat and swooped down for the fallen bills. There must have been near a thousand dollars. "No splitting the fee," I asked.

"No, no. It's all yours. Though some of us will have to stay and watch. Make sure you've done a proper job."

I shrugged my shoulders, "It's all the same to me." I looked at the others, "You could all stay, if you'd like. Won't change the work," I chortled.

My words rang like buckshot, reminding birds ' freedom. The few, few flew, floop, floop. Leaving only myself, the Mayor and the Priest on that plot.

"Paul," the Mayor shouted.

"Yes Uncle," the heavyset man turned reluctantly from his flee.

"Git over here boy."

I could see Paul's lower lip start to tremble, but ultimately he silently agreed, and came to stand; albeit behind his uncle the Mayor, and the Priest.

"Let's get started," the Mayor demands.

The Priest began the last rites or some passage from the Bible, and I pulled the suspenders from my shoulders and spit in either palm as I picked up a shovel and started digging up the dirt.

The three men watched me, their eyes fixated on each pile I scooped. With a few subtle encouragements by the Mayor as I dug deeper and deeper and deeper until the hole was tall enough for me to stand in.

"That's a good hole," the Mayor commented.

"Agreed, a good hole there Frank. A good one indeed."

I reached for a hand above to climb back out, but the men recoiled at my extension.

Now I've been home-free for some time now, for most durations of my adult life in fact, so I knew, or at least felt as if I knew their reasoning for not wanting to touch the dirtied hand of a man with no land. And thought nothing more of it as I pushed against the shovel, crawled onto my belly, and hoisted myself clear from the hole I had dug.

"Could you giver him a push," I motioned to the casket, still breathing plenty hard from my climb.

The men shook their heads. The Mayor stating loudly, "This is your job. We're only here to see you do it right."

"It's going to break," I warned.

"They'll eventually break," the Priest replied.

No one else said another word, so I nodded during the silence, "Alright. Here we go then." I pushed the casket until it was near the mouth. And then with as much gentleness as I could manage, I lowered the thing inside. Indeed the wood groaned as it cracked open in one corner when my leverage gave. I looked up afraid of what I had done, but none of the men were concerned. So I carried on, as nothing had changed.

When I finished laying it flat, I got the shovel in my hands again and piled on the dirt.

The look on their faces, the size of their eyes, the way they watched me throw every shovel of dirt inside. It must be what an Olympian feels like. Judged, awe, and all inspiring; if I do be bold. And as the dirt flattened plainly, they clapped. Clapped. I had never seen anything of the sort. But my hands were numb, raw to the touch, and clutching a fistful of money. So I could think of no other action but to bow.

That night the Mayor and Paul took me down to the pub, where other townsfolk had gathered. They bought me drinks all night long, and the pub owner even put me up in the guest room. By the time the party had ended last night, it was no mystery to the townsfolk that I was a stranger. Between themselves they deduced it in an instant. But in exchange for my cover, I found myself waking up the next morning, still feeling my drink. The best part of it all, was that I didn't spend a cent of my earnings. Not to mention some time, late in the night, a handshake deal with the Mayor to be the town's newest undertaker had been struck.

It would be a far cry from the unencumbered lifestyle that I had grown fond of, but having a roof over my head, square meals three times a day, and a likeness to reverence from the townly folk, made it an easy change to adhere.

Even if they did watch me dig and then bury the dead, each time, every time, with long lasting stares, and wide open eyes.

Though it wouldn't be several months later, and two more buried bodies, until I started questioning, why?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was September, when the first leaves were painted autumn. I had acclimated well with the residents of Achnought. And saved up some money. The plentiful walks outdoors to manage the property, and working with my hands; made me forget the mundane tasks and solidity of a careered lifestyle.

I hardly even missed being on the road.

And I had woken up, to one of those nights were I was glad to be Frank, blemished red, still, from the previous night's wine. We had buried old Mamie, in yester. Mamie Strue who was beloved by all the town's folk. Even in my short tenure at Achnought, the lovely lass gave me nothing but delightful impressions of Everyone's Favorite Grandmother. And like any other death in this here town, we celebrated the night away in her honor. It was always a party, each ending salute managing to make me question how many deaths they would carry on for.

Old Mamie was an easy burial, as far as my one handed experience could tell me. Tiny and frail, no higher was her casket than my chest, though a deep hole I still dug for her, less the winter rains come and wash out the mud from her resting.

A deep, dark hole, that the townsfolk were ever interested by; which caused a gathering around my work, as of late, when word spread of my doing. And now children, curious eyes, and their teenage sitters huddled around the shovel as a crowd would in a game of golf.

Silent mesmerization, as I lowered the stick down to the ground, and away.

And then, still waiting on their eyes, I patted the ground a final send to the sounds of clapping. Always the clapping. I dare not find out when they won't clap.

I was still relishing the best of yesterday, when I began to make my daily rounds, walking the silent garden in peruse of a loose blade or unkept headstone, when I saw it in the morning dew. A figure laying atop the dirt of Old Mamie's grave.

At first I reasoned it had to be a morning mourner mourning the deceased. Ignoring the way the legs bent in the shadow. Even foolish enough to calling out my name as I approached. Less I startle their grief.

"It's just Frank, the groundskeeper here." No answer. "I hope I'm not disturbing you." Still no answer. "I h-hope," I felt a scream crawl into my throat. It lodged itself between the drummer and my swallower as I came upon the sight of Old Mamie laying on top of her grave. The dirt still fresh on her shoulder, and her hands completely clasped, just as she had been left when the Priest closed the coffin. But I was right about her legs, they were a tangled mess, it looked as if she been spit out of the ground, and her dress was worn, worn often as if she had slept a hundred years.

"Mamie?" I crept closer. "Is that you?" I've heard of misdiagnoses, and bells tied by loving family members in the chance that dead wasn't as dead as they thought. Grave robbers, even. But this was beyond my cognition, after I had concluded that she was indeed deceased. My anger grew. For I surmised her disturbance the work of pranksters. Scoundrels with no gain other than to make a fool of others. A thing, I could never understand. "Oh Mamie," I spoke to her as if she could hear. "What have they done to you?"

I folded her legs neatly into place, moved her body and set her gently aside, and began to dig.

"This is what happens when you let them gather around your diggings, Simon. Simon the symbol of simpletons," I huffed. "Like it's some sort of sport." I shook my head. Uncertain where the pride of work was coming from. "Never again. No. Not ever. You hear me egotistical Simon." I vowed to the frail old woman, "Mamie. I promise you this will never happen again."

It had nearly been an hour as I spoke aloud to keep my mind from the body snapping work. I had gone down to shovel in countless fashion, when a sudden pain split into the side of my arm. I howled as I raised it up into the dawn. A piece of wood, the size of my finger, had been lodged inside. I angrily searched the ground, panning my shovel head for an assailant before realizing that it were not the root of a tree or buried other. No, neither. It was a piece of the coffin.

The Coffin had been completely desecrated. Pieces of it looked as if it had been fed through a wood chipper. Almost nothing was left. Had I not known it to be a grave, I would have thought that I had dug into a rat's nest under the ground, for it be an infestuous sight to behold.

I gagged as the smell came to greet me, Waving and wafting, stinging my nostrils, and creeping so deeply into my brain that I knew no matter how long, after, the mere thought of today would cause the smell to come crawling back out.

If a natural disaster would be used to describe my coming into town that morning, I think they would call it a storm, for I came like lightning and shouted thunder through Main boulie, tearing open doors, causing quite the commotion, dragging along others in my wake until I found Mayor Hannon eating his morning eggs at the diner.

"What's the matter," he asked. Glancing back at the crowd I had mustered, wiping the crust of toast from his mouth.

"Someone dug up old Mamie last night," I shouted my grievance.

"Dug her up," a voice behind me asked.

"Old Mamie," another followed.

The Mayor smiled, and waved the others off. Putting a large hand on my shoulder and seating me in his booth after pardoning the crowd. Not that they needed much convincing, as they nearly disappeared on their own after hearing the news. The diners too, their plates still steaming, with napkins thrown across them. And even the cook.

I didn't know what was going on, but suddenly being alone there with the Mayor, was starting to prickle the hairs on the back of my neck.

He was a rather large man, had big shoulders, and a commanding presence. Meanwhile, I had shied away from society for the most part, long ago, still stuck in bygones. So when he looked at me with his big terrifying stare, I could hear the words come, but was unable to listen. Only catching the warning he gave, and what little instruction, "Here's the key to the town's mausoleum. Put her in there." And, "Never. Speak about this again."

Shaken, I too, hurriedly left. Letting the door swing behind me, peeking only in time to see the Mayor go back to his breakfast, before it slammed shut.

I clutched the key in hand, stumbling over the sidewalk as I made my way, clawing and trying to find my footing, until my feet found fair ground and broke into a flat out run. I would have kept going if it hadn't been for my promise to make things right with old Mamie. And if I lived to be a hundred, I'll never understand why my word seemed so important that day. Perhaps it was also the way the Mayor looked at me, expecting me to fulfill my duties. And I dared not care to find the else.

Whatever the cause, my run came to a jog, and then walkd ' as I drew closer to the cemetery, catching my breath, staring at the long road out of Achnought, ahead. Knowing that no one could stop me if I just kept going. Instead, I turned at the gate, walked between the rows of gravestones sticking out of the ground like sore thumbs, in order to crouch next to the old figure that was Mamie Strue.

She was still laying as I left her. Neat, and frail looking as ever. Nothing terrifying, other than the fact that death had come to her, touched her, took her. So I placed my hands over where death might have, and carried her to the mausoleum.

When I first took the job, I had been told to not step inside until it was necessary. They didn't even trust me with the key. Something that disturbed me before, but now I wish I hadn't been 'been bothered' to be bothered.

I slipped the iron tip into the gothic lock and heard the tumblers click into place. When I looked inside, I was not prepared for what I saw. It was filled with bodies! And they were standing! Still in rows, clinging dearly to the flesh of their living days. Their faces deeply sunken, eye lids dried and pried back from decay, standing in neat, and nearly made me drop the old woman in my arms.

"Shit you fucking ass lickers," I cursed. Once I got a grip of myself, "Hello," I called out. Not thinking about the consequence of, if something answered. Relieved when nothing did. "Damnit. I nearly crapped myself." My eyes skipping along the rows of the dark, gaunt faces as I spoke to liven the atmosphere. Each one was thin, and hauntingly pale. They stood like a forest of white birch. Stiff as one too.

I didn't know what to do. Could have been standing there stricken in fear all day. But I decided, eventually, that were not a thing for me. Nor a place I wanted to spend time in any longer. So I found a place, wide enough, for me to lay down Old Mamie. And I backed away, with my eyes still on the standing dead. Closing the door shut behind me, and knotting the lock.

And here's the part where I wished that curiosity didn't best me. But it did. As I looked through the bars near the top of the door and saw the figure of Old Mamie, lying on the floor, slowly start to rise. Causing the dirt to fall from her hair as her broken legs creaked uncertainly next to an old man that I recognized from the photo albums at her wake, to be none other than Don Strue, her husband.

I wished I could have found it to be sweet, but truth is, I ran back to my house and slammed the door shut, and would not have come out for several days. More, if I had my choice, if not for the trees.
