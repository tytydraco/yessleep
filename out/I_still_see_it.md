This happened to me when I was around 8-10 years old. My family and I used to live in a huge house it was me, my parents and two younger siblings we each had huge rooms to ourselves all of our rooms had a small door that led to an attic crawl space, it seemed perfect for us kids since we played in it and stored all of our toys in there. After one month there however every night I started hearing disgruntled voices coming from that little attic door I didn’t know what to make of it at first until I would hear the knocking. I would hear three knocks coming from the door (I was pretty fearless as a child and now that I look back as a 26M I would’ve noped the fuck out of that house) The first time it happened I was curious it was about to be 1 in the morning and I heard it, the voices at first than the knocks came right after I got out of bed and opened the door thinking it was my little brother wanting to play but nothing there was nothing on the other side it was at this moment I felt cold all over my body so I closed the door and jumped back in bed. 

Later that night at around 3-4 in the morning I heard my door open and my little brother came from behind it saying “can I come sleep with you I had a bad dream” I was half awake so I just agreed and let him in my bed not even 5 minutes later I heard my little brothers voice again and this time I woke myself up right away every door in my room was wide open my closet, the little attic door and my bedroom door were open I looked to my door and my brother was there he looked terrified and said he had a bad dream. I was confused and asked “you just came to my room no?” He shook his head and at this point I felt nothing but pure fear wash over me I jumped out of bed and ran downstairs to my parents room with my brother and cried for a minute straight about my experience my mom never believed me so she sent me back upstairs I opened my door and everything was closed again. 

Three nights later at around the same time I heard it but this time the voices were deeper and much louder than before I felt an overwhelming dread and to my horror the little attic door started to open on its own (mind you only I could lock it since the lock was on my side) in the frame I saw a figure on all fours slowly crawl out than stand upright in my room it wasn’t sleep paralysis cause I ran out screaming, I never slept in that room again and we ended up moving a month later due to my dads job. To this day I still feel like something or someone’s watching me sleep, I’ll see things behind my shoulder here and there but I just ignore it now.
