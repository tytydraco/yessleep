Note: I was originally going to break this tale into three parts but decided to drop it all in one piece. Forgot to change the title, so there is only one Part.



My name is Natalie, and I own a shop on Essex Street called The Celtic Cauldron. We’re a few doors down from the comic book place and across the street from the old bank, the one with the thin old man who sits by the window and always smiles and waves when I walk by. I smile and wave back. He’s been there since I was a little girl, as old then as he is now. My grandmother told me that he was there when she first opened the shop. She also whispered to me that I should never take a loan from him. She never said why.

 

People know Salem as a hotbed of magic and witchcraft, and it is. Take a walk down Essex Street and you’ll see the good, the bad, and the ugly. There are the candle-and-incense places, the Goth shops with some stuff on the side, the New Age bookshops with enough crystals to fill a cavern. My place is one of the several that cater to the more dedicated practitioner. There’s a lot of magic here, but you’d be forgiven for walking past one of the most magical places in town. After all, there’s not a pentagram or scented candle to be seen in its windows. I’m talking about the best little foodie shop on the North Shore, Nibbles and Sips, owned and operated by my friend, Maude.

 

Maude was a part of my tribe from high school. Back then she was kind of a mouse, hiding behind her hair and always scribbling in this little notebook she carried around. Some of us joked that she was composing her Book of Shadows. Others said that she was writing the great American novel. Turns out she was scratching down ideas for recipes. After high school I went off to college for a business degree and she went to this famous culinary academy in Belgium. Three years later she was back in Salem and working as a chef in some of the fanciest places around. It was no surprise to anyone when Maude self-published her first cookbook. Since then she’s become something of a local celebrity. She has a Web site called The Hungry Maude. One of those big shows on the Food Channel named it their Site of the Week not long ago.

 

Maude was the ultimate kitchen witch and she really could cook up a storm. No, really, she made a soufflé once that filled the sky with clouds and dropped a ton of hail. In July. Girl was scary good, but she only wanted to make people happy through food and never went looking for trouble. I suppose it was inevitable that trouble would come looking for her.

 

It certainly didn’t seem like a day for trouble that morning as I walked to the shop. The mid-Spring weather was cool and breezy, and the streets were not as packed with the mad traffic that seemed to be everywhere these days. The army surplus store down the street was having a sale on gas masks and from the candle shop wafted the gentle scent of myrrh. I waved at the old man in the bank and unlocked the Cauldron, pulling the “Go Away, I’m Sleeping” sign from the window.

 

 

Bethany was already there when I arrived. My PerkyGoth shop assistant was busying herself restocking the spell components table while chatting with the cat skeleton by the cash register. She’d taken to calling the skeleton Mister Skinny. I swear, she thought it was answering her. “No, it’s true! They used to have these things called cassette tapes, and people would put a whole bunch of music on them.” I closed the door a bit hard so she’d notice me, and she did. “Morning, Nat! Did you ever used to make mix tapes?”

 

“All the time”, I replied as I dropped my stuff behind the counter. “I think I still have a Jesus Jones tape in a drawer somewhere.”

 

“Oh, I was thinking more of dance music, not religious stuff.”

 

I let that one pass. “Anything come in the mail?”

 

She went to the counter and flipped through a small stack of letters. “We got the electric bill, an invoice from the shopping bag people, an envelope covered in sigils from someone named Nevins, and two offers for credit cards.” She held out the stack. “All unopened.” Bethany made a point of not opening the mail. A package she opened at the last shop where she worked held a nasty surprise that transformed her permanently into a horns-and-hooves devil girl. The magic ring on her hand (which she told everyone was her nana’s wedding ring) cast a glamour that made her look like her old self, but if you listened closely you could hear a light clopping sound when she walked.

 

I waved the stack away. “I’ll open it later.”

 

“Oh!’ Bethany suddenly remembered. “Herbert was by this morning, first thing. He was asking if you’d stop by their place when you got a chance.”

 

Herbert was Maude’s husband. You’d think with a name like Herbert he’d be an accountant or something. Nope. Herbert was a metal head with a build and an attitude that could clear any mosh pit just by his stepping into it. He’d been a bouncer at a club before meeting Maude, but he gave up all that for the culinary life. Now he was better known to fans of his local cable access show as The Fish Wizard. He would top his heavy metal attire – black jeans and a Danzig tee being his favorite – with one of those yellow fisherman’s hats over a piercing gaze that just dared you to make fun of it. People who got past the look were surprised to learn he really was a whiz with the grille. You should try his recipe for seared scallops.

 

It wasn’t unusual for Herbert or Maude to visit the Cauldron, but something about his asking me to stop by seemed odd. He certainly wasn’t an early riser. I figured I’d better find out. “I’ll go over there now.” I grabbed my coat and bag and made for the door. As I walked out I heard Bethany say, “See? I told you mix tapes were a thing.”

 

Five minutes later I was heading into Nibbles and Sips. The only patrons were an older couple mulling over the hot sauces and a nervous-looking teen lurking near the craft beer display. Maude was behind the counter, flipping through a catalog of cookware sets that cost more than most cars. She glanced up and smiled at me. “Ahoy there, matey!”

 

I met her at the end of the counter and gave her a hug. “Hey, Maude. Bethany said you guys were looking for me?”

 

She nodded. “Yep. Herb found something he wanted to show you.” She turned towards the curtained doorway at the other side of the shop. “Herb! Nat’s here!”

 

“Okay!” a voice called from the back. Herb came out a few seconds later, his usual black tee and jeans complimented by a long apron with KILL THE COOK emblazoned in red.

 

“Hey, Herbie.” I’m the only one he lets call him that. Don’t believe me? Try it.

 

“Hey, Gnat.” Ditto, him calling me that. He’s the only one who can say my name right but still get the “g” to come through.

 

“Your better half says you got something to show me?”

 

“That I do. Come on in the back.” He gave a this-way wave and walked back through the curtain. I followed.

 

Maude called out, “Hey, no fondling my hubby while you’re back there!” loud enough for the hot sauce couple to hear before going over to scare the teen out of the shop.

 

They had a complete kitchen in the back where they gave cooking lessons and filmed segments for the Web and TV. Herb was prepping to cook something fishy for his show. I noticed he was using his favorite skillet, the cast-iron one with the pentagram gouged into its surface.

 

“Herbie”, I groaned. “Will you please get rid of that pan?”

 

He shook his head. “It’s a signature piece. I was thinking of having some made for the shop, sell a few to the fans.”

 

“You’re going to accidentally summon a demon with it.”

 

“Please. This thing’s a demon trap. First off, it’s cast iron with a silver handle. It’s seasoned with Tibetan red salt. And anything that gets past the iron or the silver or the salt will land in a sea of frying garlic. Instant, painful death.”

 

“Your funeral. Okay, what you got to show me?”

 

“It’s over there.” He pointed to a prep table where something slightly smaller than a bread box sat concealed by a tea towel under an accidentally dramatic overhead light. We stepped over to stand on either side of the table, the covered item between us.

 

I studied the cloth. “It’s not one of those screaming skulls, is it? I hate those things.”

 

Herb shook his head. “No, and it’s not the Holy Grail, either.”

 

“Good. Too many guys with swords looking for that.”

 

He pulled the tea towel away.

 

It took me a minute to figure out what I was looking at. At first I thought it was an ingot of polished steel with a short stick stuck through its middle. The metal was polished to a mirror shine and every edge was rounded. I peered closer. There were engravings on all sides, panels of intricate knot work framed with Futhark, the runic language of Scandinavia. Old Futhark, to be precise. The wood was a handle, barely long enough to grasp, well-polished with use and capped on the end in the same shining metal.

 

“Beautiful”, I finally said. “You get it online, or at one of the shops?”

 

“Neither. It came up tangled in my line when I was out fishing yesterday.”

 

“Huh. Probably some kid dropped it overboard on the commuter boat, coming back from a con in Boston.”

 

Herb gave me a quirky smile. “I don’t think so. Why don’t you go ahead and give it another look? A *real* look?”

 

I knew what he meant. He wanted me to use my inner eye. That really piqued my interest. He wouldn’t ask me to do that for anything mundane. “Sure.” I leaned in and, closing my eyes, opened my mind’s eye and passed my hand over it. Next thing I knew, I was sitting on the floor. Herb was standing over me, offering me a hand. I took it and he pulled me up as I tried to untangle what I’d just seen.

 

I brushed off some imaginary dust. “That was like drinking from the fire hose.”

 

“You okay? You went right down, like someone hit you.”

 

“Yeah, fine. The impressions were so strong. Nothing like I’d ever felt before. Blood, and fire, and lots of stuff right out of a Tyr video.” I took a moment to collect myself, then gave the object on the table a second look.

 

I saw a hand reach for the hammer. A hand with an iron grip, covered in scars and burns, connected to an arm that was all wiry muscle. A tall, lean guy with long russet hair and a braided beard, and eyes that could stare down a mountain. A flash of thunder.

 

My eyes snapped open. I knew who he was. And I knew what *it* was now.

 

 “It can’t be” I said under my breath.

 

“Why not?”

 

“What do you mean, Why not? Because it’s not real. It doesn’t exist!”

 

“And yet, it sits on a table right in front of you.”

 

“Herbie”, I said, turning to stare at the impossible item before me, “that’s Mjolnir.”

 

He turned and looked at it as well. “Yep.”

 

I wasn’t sure what to say. Before us on the table was Mjolnir, the mythical weapon of a mythical god. Herb and I just stood there and stared at it for the longest time before I asked, “You found this yesterday while out fishing?”

 

“Yep. Thought I’d hooked an old boot or something.”

 

“What the hell was Mjolnir doing in Salem harbor?”

 

“I didn’t find it there. Me and Lazlo were on a charter boat off Innsmouth. You know, by the reef? Catch there is amazing.”

 

“Doesn’t answer my question. It’s still thousands of miles from where it should be. In fact, it shouldn’t even be on this planet. Ragnarok took place on Asgard.”

 

“Maybe that’s the answer. When Asgard was destroyed it fell to Earth. I mean, not ‘fall’ like from the sky. Asgard wasn’t a space station.”  Herb paused dramatically. “Or, was it?”

 

“You’re taking this all rather lightly.”

 

Herb shrugged. “I thought at first it was a replica, same as you. I picked it up, it did nothing. Might as well use it to crack walnuts. Then Maude saw it and started chirping about its aura and how she thought the runes were glowing. Seeing as she’s Crafty and I’m a Darrin, figured we could use a second opinion.” “Darrin” was local slang for a non-magical person who was the spouse of a practitioner. Happens more than you think.

 

Maude came through the curtain from the shop. “Snack time. Who wants grilled cheese?”

 

“Me”, Herb and I said in unison.

 

“So”, Maude asked me as she went to the fridge, “is it the real deal?”

 

Herb looked at me, so I answered. “I think so.”

 

“That’s a good thing, right?”

 

“Yes!” said Herb.

 

“No!” I replied. “How can you think this is good?”

 

“Are you kidding? This is the hammer of the gods.”

 

“I know, that’s my point.”

 

“Well, what would you recommend we do?”

 

“Get rid of it!”

 

“Why?”

 

“Why? You ever read the Eddas? This is a weapon of mass destruction. Thor could wipe out armies with it. Big monsters, too. And that means someone will be looking for it. This”, I said pointing at Mjolnir, “is an asshole magnet. The giants and the trolls were always trying to steal it. One time they did, and when Thor got it back he used it to kill the entire clan of the guy who stole it.” I paused to collect myself. “Look, whether or not Thor is still around doesn’t matter. There are at least two sides of an eternal war that would love to get their hands on this thing, and would flatten Salem and everyone in it to do it.”

 

Maude was now at the stove, pressing the sandwiches into the pentagram skillet with a spatula. “I thought all the gods died at Ragnarok.”

 

“Not all. Two of Thor’s sons were among the survivors. One of them became the hammer’s new owner.”

 

“So, let’s give it back to them.”

 

“Would if I could. Sadly, I lost their phone numbers.”

 

Herb shrugged. “Okay, let’s drop it back in the ocean.”

 

I shook my head. “We’d have to drop it in the Marianas Trench or something. Otherwise, it will only wash up again. Imagine this falling into the hands of some schoolyard bully.”

 

Maude came over to us with a frying pan full of sandwiches. “Nat, you’re getting all responsible, I can tell.”

 

I bit into my sandwich and instantly went to cheesy heaven. “Mm, wow. Is this brie?”

 

“Yes, and don’t change the subject. You want us to, what? Destroy it?”

 

“I’m not sure we can. This is one of those drop-in-a-volcano deals. Even that might not do the trick.”

 

Herb mused, “Good thing. The nearest volcano is in Iceland.”

 

Maude turned towards the table where our problem sat. “Oh, man, that would be so Tolkien! Could you imagine, taking it to Iceland and ohmygod, what the fuck is that!?”

 

Herb and I spun around to see what had freaked Maude. There was a short, squat, grainy shadow of a man, flickering like the static of an old TV if the static were all black. A shadow that had been creeping towards Mjolnir, fingers outstretched to grasp it. A shadow that was now standing still and growling at us.

 

Herb was the first to react. Chalk it up to all those years as a nightclub bouncer. He grabbed the skillet out of Maude’s hand and threw it at the shadow, right at its head. The pan made contact with a loud “thwack!” and the creature let out a screech any howler monkey would be proud of. It ran through the curtains and out into the shop. Seconds later we heard a crash of glass as it smashed through the lower panel of the front door.

 

Herb stepped forward and picked up the skillet. The pentagram etched into its surface glowed slightly. He turned to us and brandished it triumphantly. “Ha! Told ya!”

 

“What was that?” asked Maude, collecting herself.

 

I took another bite of my grilled cheese. “Well, if I had to guess, I’d say it was a dark elf, one of the elementals from Svartalfheim that made the hammer. They probably sensed it when Herb pulled it out of the ocean.” I paused to swallow and brush the crumbs off my hands. “Didn’t think they’d look so fuzzy.”

 

Herb shook the skillet with grim purpose. “I got a feeling he’s not the last visitor we’ll have.”

 

Right then a familiar voice rang out from the shop. “Hello? Everything all right in here?” We looked at each other and went out to meet the new arrival.

 

The front door opened slowly as Officer Denny Lang of the Salem Police gingerly stepped in over the spray of broken glass. “Anyone here?”

 

“Hey, Denny”, said Herb, waving the skillet in greeting.

 

“Hey, Herb. Guy on the street said he saw a dwarf breaking windows at this location.” In any other town that would be a sensation, but Salem? Go fish. Denny then turned to Maude and me. “Hey, Maude, Nat. What’s all this about a dwarf?”

 

Maude nodded. “Yeah, we were in the back making grilled cheese when he came in. Tried to pocket some stuff before Herb chased him off. We didn’t get a good look at him.”

 

“He was dressed all in black, like everyone else in Salem”, I added helpfully.

 

“Anyone get hurt?” We all shook out heads. Denny made a jot in his notebook. “Okay, well, I’ll file a report at the end of my shift. Vandalism and attempted larceny by persons unknown.” He made to leave, then turned to me a bit hesitantly. “Hey, Nat, is Bethany working today?”

 

“Yeah, she’s at the shop right now.”

 

“Okay. Thanks. Have a good day!” And he was off, walking not too quickly in the direction of the Cauldron.

 

Maude smiled knowingly as she asked me, “He’s sweet on Bethany, isn’t he?”

 

I nodded. “And she likes him, too. I just wish the two of them would realize it.”

 

Herb went looking for a broom while Maude called a glazier to fix the door. I wandered into the back once more and stood next to the table on which sat the world’s most dangerous hammer. I didn’t have a clue what to do. I got called on a lot by the denizens of this town to give advice or help them out of a jam, usually after they’d tried to fix it themselves and made whatever it was worse. But, this? Herb might as well have fished up an atomic bomb. Way beyond my pay grade.

 

“What the hell are we going to do with you?” I asked it.

 

That’s when everything went all blacklight. I’d had something like this happen before when some mage or witch was sweeping the area with their third eye. The stronger ones hit like a black strobe and left me momentarily woozy. This, though, this was something else. Seriously, it was like the cheap effects on an old TV show. The well-lit room became made of shades of black, with the exception of Mjolnir which seemed to almost be glowing. I had to lean forward and steady myself by grabbing the edge of the table.

 

“Interesting”, a voice said from everywhere. “Rare is the mortal who does not wilt in my presence. Ah, I see. You are a *vǫlva* of this land, are you? Beware, your *tröllkona* craft will not avail you.”

 

“Who are you?” I choked out, barely able to talk. “Don’t hide in the dark. Show yourself.”

 

The voice seemed amused. “I am. You dispatched my servant so easily, I had to come myself and see. But there is no power here. Where is your iron rod, *tröllkona*? Where are the herbs of your trade? Are you outlaw?”

 

My head was swimming, overwhelmed and caught off guard by this presence. Afraid that I might pass out, I focused on the only thing in sight that seemed unaffected by the overwhelming mind. I reached out and picked up the hammer.

 

Okay, you ever been outside on a hot, humid, heavy summer’s day? The kind that feels like a weight, that’s like walking through mud? And, all of a sudden, a storm front moves in from the ocean and sweeps it all away in a blast of cool, clear wind? That moment right before the skies darken and boil, and the thunder crashes in the distance? Yeah, it was like that. Only better.

 

Instantly the darkness and oppression cleared. I stood up behind the table, holding Mjolnir in my left hand. My first thought? “Wow, this thing is a lot lighter than it looks.” My second thought: “Oh, hell.”

 

Standing in the middle of the room was a woman, gaunt and tall, wrapped in tattered shadow. In one hand she grasped a staff of brass. The right side of her face was beautiful, with the pale flawless skin and sharp features you’d see on the cover of a magazine. But the left was splotched and grey and showed signs of rot around the sightless eye. Both sides were staring right at me.

 

I shook and took in a sharp breath. “You died at Ragnarok.”

 

She flashed a grimacing smile. “Did I? Could I?”

 

“You were at your father’s side.”

 

“When Loki fell beneath Heimdall’s blade I returned to my own domain. All those within were spared Ragnarok. Some were gods themselves, who even now sit in Asgard.” She raised her fee hand towards me, the bones showing through. “I have come for my cousin’s hammer.”

 

“It doesn’t belong to you.”

 

“It does not belong to you, either.”

 

*This is weird*, I thought. *She could stomp me flat. Why doesn’t she just take it?* “Thor’s sons. They survived Ragnarok as well, didn’t they? The hammer is theirs. Let them come for it.”

 

We stood there quietly staring at one another for a long moment. I’d like to tell you I was standing my ground, but truth be told I was too scared to move. Finally she dropped her hand. “I tire of this. You will surrender Mjolnir to me, or suffer my wrath.” And with that the shadows wreathing her spun fiercely, and she was gone.

 

The last of the oppression lifted from the room. I breathed deeply and held the hammer up before me. I’d always been what my grandmother called a Natural, that is, someone for whom the Craft came easily. Even so, I’d never felt my talent as strongly as I did at that moment. It *flowed* through me, free of any hindrance or doubt. Through me, and through the hammer. All at once I knew what Mjolnir truly was.

 

My reverie was cut short when Maude came in the back. “Door should be fixed in a few hours. Did I hear you talking to someone back here?” She looked at me holding the hammer. “Is, everything all right?”

 

I shook my head. “No. No, it’s not.” I looked at the spot where the half-rotted woman had stood. “ Hel has come to Salem.”

 

“Drama queen much?” Maude asked as she set to cleaning the skillet.

 

“No, not Hell, as in fire and brimstone. I mean Hel, the Norse goddess of the underworld. She was just here.”

 

“What!? I was right up by the register. I had no idea.” Maude later confided that her reaction was largely driven by the lost opportunity to get a selfie with the dark queen.

 

Herb had walked in while I was talking with a dustpan full of glass that he put in the wastebasket. “Me neither. Did she attack you?”

 

“Not physically. It was more a mental projection. She was right there, asking for the hammer. *Asking*. When does someone like Hel ask for anything? If she were here she could have taken it and there’d be nothing I could do to stop her.”

 

 “So, what did you do?”

 

“I used the hammer to banish her from my mind. That’s when she appeared in front of me.”

 

Herb was amazed. “You can use it!?”

 

“Kinda, sorta.”

 

“Ooh, throw a lightning bolt!”

 

Maude whacked his arm with a tea towel. “No! We just finished paying for this stuff.”

 

I shook my head. “I’m not going to throw a lightning bolt. I can’t.”

 

Herb nodded at Mjolnir. “You can with that.”

 

“No, I can’t. No one can. That’s not how it works.”

 

“Well, how does it work?”

 

I held Mjolnir up and looked at it. “It’s an amplifier. Whatever power the wielder already has is increased by the hammer. That’s why his enemies couldn’t use Mjolnir against Thor, not as he used it. They didn’t have his power, only the ability to amplify their own, and most of them wouldn’t figure it out before he got to them.”

 

“Not like the movies.”

 

“Nope, it works for anyone who holds it. Darrins excluded.” Herb made a sour face at me as I went on, “And you don’t need a magic belt or gloves to lift it, obviously. I’m sure the other gods in Asgard knew all this, but they wouldn’t have touched it and risked pissing off Thor. And even with a power-up like this most of the giants or trolls couldn’t match Thor on his worst day. Brilliant.”

 

As we walked out into the shop my phone rang. It was Bethany. “Nat? Are you friends with a Scandinavian volleyball team?” This was a typical query for Bethany.

 

“No, why?”

 

“Well, a woman named Valerie was here looking for you. She and her friends. About nine of them. They sounded Swedish. I told them you’d be back in a bit. Then they said they wanted some mead while they waited for you, but we don’t have any here so I sent them over to Goober Goober.” Goober Goober was this eatery around the corner where unwashed hipsters tried to impress one another while drinking obscure and overpriced Euro beers.

 

“Valerie, huh? Bet they were all named Valerie.”

 

“They were! How did you know that?”

 

“Lucky guess. Did you notice anything odd about them?”

 

“Well, I did think it was a bit early in the day for alcohol.”

 

“No, I mean, were they wearing armor, or riding winged horses?”

 

“Oh, no, nothing like that. They were all dressed alike, though. And very tall, and in very good shape. Maybe they do synchronized swimming.”

 

“Okay, let me know if they come back.” Then, on a whim, “Say Hi to Denny for me.”

 

“Okay, bye!” As she hung up I heard her say, “Nat says Hi.”

 

I looked at the others. “Bethany says the Valkyrie just came into the Cauldron.”

 

“They didn’t bust up the place, did they?”

 

“No, she sent them over to Goober Goober for a drink.” I stopped to think. “I thought the Valkyrie all died at Ragnarok, too?”

 

“I think we’re learning that the Eddas might not be entirely accurate”, said Herb.

 

“Then maybe Thor is still around”, Maude mused. “Maybe he’ll come back for his hammer.”

 

I twirled Mjolnir in my hand. “God, I hope so. Sooner this thing is off Midgard, the better.”

 

“Can you call him? See if he’ll come and get it” asked Herb.

 

I looked at him with a smirk. “Don’t have his phone number, either.”

 

“No, I mean reach out to him. You say the hammer’s an amplifier, right? What if you use it to call him to Salem? Boost your own powers, like a radio transmitter.”

 

I thought about it for a moment. “Huh. It might work. But I’ve never had much luck with telepathy. I receive impressions fine, it’s the sending I suck at.”

 

“Okay, so use it like radar. Read everything, but only look for him. See if he pings.”

 

“I dunno. That kind of broadcast will go everywhere. Who knows what it might attract?”

 

“It won’t matter if he gets here first.”

 

“And, if he doesn’t? We’ll have a shit storm on our hands.”

 

“Yeah, but they’re already coming.”

 

I sighed. “Okay. Here goes.”

 

“Wait.” Maude was looking intense. “Can we do this outside? I don’t want to wreck the place.”

 

Herb grabbed his magic skillet while Maude grabbed her signature black silk top hat. We stepped out onto Essex and waited while Maude locked up the shop. “Okay”, she said, jangling her big iron ring of keys, “what next?”

 

I stepped a few paces away into the middle of the cobbled street. “Foot traffic is pretty light right now. Guess we should just do it here. Herbie, get ready to catch me in case it knocks me for a loop.” He nodded and positioned himself at my back as Maude gave me a hopeful thumbs-up. I held Mjolnir up with both hands, opened up my mind, and pushed.

 

Everything went a brilliant white, then slowly faded till I found myself standing in a great hall of wood and stone. Down one end beyond the central fire pit sat the tall, lean man with the braided beard and piercing eyes I had seen in my first vision. Thor. I’d thought my efforts to find him would be more like a compass, pointing the way. Instead, I was standing right in front of him. And he was looking straight at me.

 

Finally, he spoke, in a voice that echoed like thunder and crackled like lightning. “Hail and well met, *vǫlva*. You are proving to be a quick study.”

 

Truth be told, I was a teensy bit terrified. My voice squeaked as I said, “H-hi, oh, hey, it’s you. Oh, wow, oh, boy. Shit.”

 

He seemed delighted. “Be not so timid. I often have this effect on women.”  He gestured with a flick of his finger to the hammer I still held before me. “But, you did not come here to speak of my manly prowess, did you?”

 

It helped me to regain my composure to see that even gods can be self-centered jerks. “N-no, I didn’t. You left this on Midgard.” I shook the hammer a bit for emphasis.

 

“Yes, it went missing a few days ago. Or, was it years? Hard to tell when you are as long-lived as I. Long-lived, and virile. Have I mentioned my virility? But, yes, the hammer. I had assumed that Loki had stolen it again. He does that a lot. Amuses the Niflheim out of him to play his little hide-and-seek. I suspect it is all that snake poison we dripped on his head. Made it go soft.”

 

“Yes. All very interesting. The hammer.”

 

“I see you found it. I should give you a reward.”

 

“Okay. I didn’t find it, my friend Herbert found it. And now, all your friends keep showing up in my town, and we’re all really scared they’re going to do something rude to get their hands on it. Something like kill everyone and burn the place down.”

 

His eyes lit up as he looked at me, then he laughed heartily and stood up. “That’s wonderful!”

 

I blinked hard. “What? Why is that anything close to wonderful?”

 

He got a glint in his eye. “Because THIS!” And he snapped his fingers.

 

And I was back on Essex Street, holding Mjolnir aloft, looking at Maude.

 

“Well?” she asked. “Are you going to do it?”

 

I lowered the hammer and held it in my left hand. “I just did. I’ve been talking to Thor for the last few minutes.”

 

Herb walked around to stand with Maude. “Nope, you raised the hammer up for a second, then lowered it down again.”

 

Then the sky darkened with amazing speed. We heard the soft, drawn-out boom of distant thunder. A flash of lightning ran across the sky above us and the crash of imminent thunder rang all around us. And then, he was there. I knew he was tall, but I hadn’t realized how tall till he was right in front of me. Had to be seven feet if he was an inch.

 

His voice rang out in its crackle and boom. “Greetings, mortals! It is I, Thor Odinson, walking among you once more!” A few people stopped and clapped or watched in silence, but most passers-by continued without seeming to notice. “Did you not hear me? I am Thor, come down from Asgard! Are you not amazed?” A few more spectators joined the small but growing crowd.

 

“They probably think you are an actor.”

 

He was undaunted. “An actor? Can an actor do THIS?” And with a dramatic flourish he raised his hands to the sky and shot lightning from his fingertips. The gathering crowd broke into applause.

 

“Oh, you ham.” We turned to see that Hel had appeared from nowhere to glare at us from a few yards away. “I was here first. I claim Mjolnir. Give it to me!” Behind her, I could see a somewhat disheveled group of tall blonde women coming our way. From behind a baby carriage at the edge of the crowd a short and fuzzed form seemed to glower at us.

 

Thor laughed again. I got the impression he liked to laugh. A lot. “You know the rules, cousin. If anyone is found to possess Mjolnir it cannot be taken from them. It is their right to award it to whoever they please.” He turned to me. “The *vǫlva* will decide.”

 

The street went silent as I became the center of attention. *Oh, great*, I thought. *Which supernatural entity do I want to piss off today?* I looked around at the gods and monsters before me. Every one of them wanted Mjolnir to boost their own powers. Well, every one but Thor. He didn’t seem to care. That self-centered jerk knew he could beat any of them even if they had Mjolnir. The clock was ticking. I had to give it to someone. So, I did.

 

“Herbert. I give the hammer to Herbert.”

 

I’ve never seen a crowd stop and stare like they all did. Everyone looked at me bug-eyed, except Thor, who blinked hard and laughed even harder.

 

Hel was first to respond, striking the cobblestones so hard with her brass staff that it dug a pothole. “You cannot give the hammer of the gods to a mortal man!”

 

“Thor said I could give it to anyone I please.” I turned to the thunder god and gave him my best sultry look. “Isn’t that right, o king of storms?”

 

Thor strutted in place with flattery. “That I did! And, did you not say that this Herbert was the one to find it? And did I not say he would be rewarded? So is his reward!”

 

“You jest”, said Valerie as her shield-maidens gathered behind her. “What use is a hammer that embiggens one’s power to a powerless man?”

 

I stepped towards Maude and Herbert and held up Mjolnir for him to take. “As long as he wields it, no other can use it against the gods.” *Or anyone else for that matter*, I thought.

 

Thor looked at us with wide-eyed surprise before letting out yet another laugh. “Ha HA! A jest worthy of Loki! A tale worthy of a skald!”

 

Hel grimaced sourly before shrugging. “What is one mortal lifetime to such as us?” And with a tap of her staff she disappeared in a wreath of smoke. The Valkyries wandered off kvetching to one another as the fuzzy dwarf ran off in the direction of the Bunghole, an angry poodle nipping at his heels.

 

“Well played, my fair *vǫlva*! You have given our game a fresh ending. I salute you!” Thor bowed graciously, then, with a saucy wink, said, “Stop by my hall if you are ever in the neighborhood”, and in a flash of lightning he was gone.

 

The watching crowd, which had grown rather large, burst into applause as Maude and Herbert shared a victory kiss. I looked around and did the only thing I could think to do. I bowed to the crowd.

 

And, that was that. I did hear the next day that Goober Goober was closed for the duration after a group of women some identified as a Danish sorority got drunk and trashed the place.  Denny has been stopping by the Cauldron when on patrol more and more when Bethany is working, “to make sure everything is okay”. And last night, I turned in to the local cable access channel to watch The Fishing Wizard as he cracked open some crab shells with his new hammer.
