 I think we made the best decision we could have with the teeth last week. I mean, they seemed dead, right? After the... incident, we swept them up and dumped them in the garbage outside. Yeah, I know, sentient hungry teeth probably fall under the jurisdiction of the "hazardous waste" sticker, but I wasn't about to bag them up and keep them around.

Well, it turns out that my instinct to not keep them in the shop or on hand was a good one because they aren't dead. Dormant would be a better word, or perhaps hibernating. They ate enough and were not hungry. I can only imagine that those teeth are the reason for the issue we had this week and *will* be having for the coming weeks, assuming we can even fix it. How does one kill teeth? I am afraid to look that up, I don't want to be put on a list for googling "how to destroy teeth." Plus, who knows if they even are actual teeth or just look like them.

If you're new here, you are probably very confused. Start [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/11dsc3v/the_drowsy_spectre/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) if you want some context.

Anyway, teeth. Is there some sort of supernatural dentist to get rid of these? Someone mentioned a tooth fairy, but I've never heard of any fairytale where the teeth fought back. I don't want “killed a tooth fairy” on my resume.

A day or two after my previous post, we started to see the symptoms of what I am calling a plague. A pandemic of teeth, the Bite of ‘23, if you will. Most of the customers affected were acting pretty normal when they came into the shop. Nothing in their behavior changed, other than the silence. The regulars knew we were aware of what they wanted, anyone new that was affected tried their best to communicate with their hands.

Because they had teeth lodged in their flesh. Sometimes it was just one, others had a handful. Some on their faces, hands, arms. Eyes, mouth (aside from their own teeth, of course). Amber was unaffected, though. Last week we had all but forgotten her, slightly off camera and sitting in the rain. The teeth had taken Heartmin but paid Amber no mind at all. Did she know something we didn't? Maybe she could dissuade whatever force was causing the infection.

So, when I came in for my shift, I arrived a bit early.

That seemed to please her. "Axel!" I shivered and had to physically freeze in place to recover. "You wanted to see me?"

"Yes. How did you know that?"

She crossed her arms. "Because you came in early." The trunk of her old hatchback opened on its own.

"You've seen the teeth?"

Amber nodded. "The *kepsi*? Of course. I saw it eat up the screamer."

"*Kepsi*?"

"Axel, you should know. You made it real, after all. This isn't your attempt at clearing the forest of dangers?"

I wish it was. "No, I don't know what is going on and I didn't make this. This isn't me."

"But it told me. It is from the void, created by your witness." Her voice deepened and light faded. My head was light and I was on my knees just to stay conscious. "*You gazed upon it sweetly."* Was the ground shaking? What the hell was Amber?!

Then everything was as it was. "If that wasn't intentional, I am curious how you will clean up this mess." She tapped a cardboard box. "Though, most odors can be beaten by a good candle. Maybe now is the time?"

I got to my feet. "I'm not buying a candle." That was the most important rule. "None of us are."

"So you say." She lifted the box. "But I am patient."

\--------------------------------------

During the shift, we saw a similar situation as the day before. The teeth still bore into most customers that had flesh, sparing only those without any meat to consume. When we slowed down and it was dark, it got really windy. No rain this time, thankfully. But I could see the trees bending outside under the parking lot's old light. It was burning out and painted the area in a deep orange. Out there, near the quiet highway that was seldom traveled, stood a small figure.

Not so small as the doll that I hid in my apartment. No, they must have been a kid. The light reached them so I could tell they weren't like the guy last week, covered in teeth. From the distance I thought they just looked like a normal kid. Maybe eight, or nine years old? No movement, no swaying in the wind. They just faced the shop.

I wasn't that concerned and neither were Barrow or Em. Dr. Fields, who we have decided to call Nomic because he can't remember his life, did not see it as we did. He had no doubt that the child outside was staring directly at him.

"Can't we just tell them to leave?" He asked, coming up from the kitchen. "They are loitering."

Oh, yeah. Nomic is officially on the team to replace Dan since we haven't seen him since he left. Seeing as Nomic has no memories or life outside of the café, he adjusted pretty well. That stare, however, unsettled him.

"Like just open the door and tell them to order something or leave."

Barrow was making a drink for the drive thru. "Seems like a bad idea but be my guest."

And he did. Nomic walked up to the door and pushed it open, but did not step outside. "Hey, you can't just stand around out there!"

They didn't react.

"Come inside or leave!"

Suddenly the kid broke into a sprint straight towards the door. In seconds they had closed the gap and were on the other side of the parking lot. Nomic slammed it shut and locked it just as the child dashed under the overhang and stopped perfectly at the full size window next to the door.

We could see then that the kids' eyes were completely black, like the night sky without stars. They didn't catch light, nor were they reflective like any other gaze. They were just... dark.

And on its cheek was a single white tooth, human from the looks of it, and it was buried into the flesh. The wound leaked a black puss.

"Do you have a phone? I need to call my parents."

Nomic glanced at us behind the counter and we shook our heads. He already knew that we weren't letting them in.

They looked like a young boy. "I am lost and it is getting really cold out here. Can I just use the phone?" Nomic backed away from the door, the kid's eyes locked onto him. "Please? It is terrifying out here! I'm so scared!"

From the woods around the highway came more small figures. Dozens, at least. They were all walking towards the front door.

"I just need to make a call. I'm hurt." He touched the wound on his cheek. The tooth responded to his voice by wiggling a little bit. "Just let me in! I'm just a kid!"

The others got closer. I could see details on most. Black eyes on them all, all children, and each with their own teeth attacking their flesh. Some had half their face covered, others only a single fang through their clothes, some just like the first boy. They crossed the parking lot and stood against the window in a line.

The first boy slammed his little fists against the window. "Let me in!"

A girl no older than four joined in. "Let me in!"

More started to hit the glass, but it took no damage. "LET US IN!"

A knocking on my right tore me from the front door. There, at the drive thru window, was another kid. She barely reached the lip. "You did this!" She cried, little hands covered in dental burrows. "Let us IN!"

Slam. Bang. Both fists trying to break through the thick glass. There was a little sticker on the top right of the window that said "large missile impact resistant" so I assumed I was safe. The front door was a bigger concern.

One of the kids started pulling hard at the door, but it wouldn't open because Nomic had the foresight to lock it. That didn't stop them from trying. Glass failed to shatter under their assault, or even crack. I don't think they were able to enter that way, it all seemed a big but empty threat.

Barrow confirmed this. "We are fine as long as they don't come in."

"Even the kids have the teeth." Em murmured. "Is it really that bad?"

"Pretty much everyone does." I had seen tons of customers, as had she.

Selene finally stepped out of the office. "Oh. Do they think we have the cure or something?"

Em winced. "Even if we did, I don't think threatening us is going to get anything."

"We have some medicine, you know." We both had a headache after the past few days, brought on by the stress of irritated customers. "Just take some."

"Probably isn't safe for a pixie to take."

"Yeah but you're half human at least, right?"

She didn't like that. "Y-yeah, I guess." Again, she winced hard and leaned against the counter. "I just need some quiet."

The kids continued screaming their demands. "I don't think you are going to get any." Barrow sighed. "What do you think, Selene? They are a bit of a problem."

"I think I am not opening that door." She shook her head. "Being a manager doesn't mean I have to deal with that."

"Doesn't it?" I quipped.

Selene sighed. "Probably."

Then the sea of kids parted. They stopped their attack on the doors and windows and moved aside, making room for something beyond them. A man with skin nearly dark as the night and long, smokey hair laid over his shoulder. He wore a black suit and a necklace that reached past his chest. A golden symbol hung from it, one that I had seen before.

"Rykar." I muttered.

He reached the door and glanced down at the first child, who had started the assault. Rykar picked the tooth from his face, holding it in his gloved hands. It wiggled about, trying to find purchase where there was none. Finally, he shrugged and casted it aside. I saw it land on the face of another child, grabbing onto the skin instantly. She didn't react.

Rykar lifted his cane and tapped on the door. "Won't you let me in?" The question was directed at their manager.

"Go away."

"Oh, but I have a few questions. Specifically regarding this... tooth issue. Curious thing, your little friend concocted." Rykar nodded at me. "It has been quite a bit of time, Axel. I am curious, who has your name?"

"I said go away. You aren't welcome here." Selene was firm. "Take the children with you."

"Oh but these aren't mine." He looked down at them. "Look at their eyes. So dark, so deep like the void. I think they belong to another Witness, wouldn't you say? Perhaps something even older. But they are flesh, all the same. I don't want to interrupt whatever this-" He gestured at the crowd. "-is, but I think Axel and I need to set an appointment. Don't we, friend?"

All of them looked in my direction, but what was I supposed to say? No one knew about the deal I had made with that devil. "Not here." Was all I could manage.

"Of course. Maybe on a day you don't work. I can come to your apartment, after all." He lowered his cane from the door. "And, in case any of you were curious, your dear friend John has had quite the time under my care."

From behind the children came John DeGuire. His face was covered in teeth, but his eyes didn't speak of any pain. He was resigned to whatever fate Rykar had for him. Still, he was silent so as to avoid the loss of his flesh. Though, for all the strength he placed on his face, I did see a gentle tear escape his now yellow eyes.

"We've had more fun than with his brother, I'd say. It is too bad Dan never got to experience this plague of teeth." Rykar looked John up and down. "Say something to your friends, why don't you?"

"Stop!" Em demanded. So did I, but it was no use.

Rkyar slammed his cane into the ground. "Say something!"

"H-help me..." The teeth wiggled about, taking little bits of skin to make more of themselves.

"That's all you have to say? You haven't seen your friends in months. Come on, catch up!"

John opened his mouth again and spoke, but it was too quiet to hear. His disease dug deeper.

"Too bad. You know how shy he is." Rykar threw up his hands. "So, what do you say, Axel? I do believe you have off Monday, so why don't I stop by? Maybe I'll even bring John along too."

"Fine, but leave him alone." I raised my voice to be certain he heard behind the closed door. "Just leave!"

Rykar nodded. "Very well. I was so hoping Dan would be around." He waved his cane, shoeing John along. "They've got a long shift to finish." Lastly, before he finally left, he turned his neck to face Selene. "And I heard you saw father. We *both* don't want him awake, so don't do that again."

With that, the children resumed their assault and Rykar was lost in the crowd. The kids probably wouldn't leave until sunrise.

"Why does Rykar want to meet with you?" Barrow asked.

They didn't need to know. "We will find out on Monday, won't we?"

"Who was that?" We'd forgotten about Nomic, who stood just within the kitchen. "W-who was that?"

There was a long history that he'd need to learn. "Rykar. Someone you should never speak to." That was all he needed to know for now.

I was standing by the drive thru and saw movement. Was that Tall Ben on the camera, standing near the back door? I couldn't see his face, but it had to be him. We aren't supposed to talk to him, it often resulted in terrible accidents, but even in the poor quality of the camera I could see something on his face. Something that didn't belong, something white.

"I'm going to use the bathroom." I lied, then dipped from the front praying that no one else would take a look at the camera. I opened the back door, but did not step outside.

Sure enough, there stood the giant. In a long gash next to his eye was a wound embedded with little white teeth from all sorts of creatures. He lifted his hand to touch the wound, revealing a similar issue with his fingers and right palm.

"Help." He asked it so simply. No deception, no tricks. "Help me."

This thing had killed a friend, strangers, and who knows what else. He was the reason John belonged to Rykar, was the cause of a great number of our issues. Did Tall Ben really think I was going to offer him assistance? It'd be best if he died from this new wound!

"Please. Take them off..." They squirmed at his voice. "We are friends, please help me."

I did consider it. Last time he perceived me as doing him a favor, he said he would offer me the answer to any question. If Tall Ben offered that again, I would have a huge advantage against any future issues I might face. I was already in the habit of making deals with supernatural creatures, what was one more?

Instead, I closed the door. He couldn't cry out, roar, lose his mind with anger, or react in any way without the teeth consuming him. Instead, it was entirely quiet until the door clicked shut. Maybe the tooth plague was a good thing, in the end.

If it killed Tall Ben, I'd be happy.
