Jacks wife tried to kill him last week. During the week that followed, he was numb and could not process what had happened. When he came to, he realized she had been acting strange the days and weeks leading up to the assault. She’d been spending more time in the basement, and subtle moments of an internal violent conflict had become apparent 

She became upset over many things. If she awoke because Jack had to leave for work, she would berate him and barely say goodbye. If he didn’t respond to a text soon enough, he’d receive and earful the next phone call. If he forgot to put the remote on the table, she would begin flipping small pieces of furniture, or just start throwing the cushions at him. She always seemed apologetic, in her own way. But that’s what she expressed towards Jack 

To herself, Jack noticed she’d keep rubber bands on her, and she was almost constantly pulling back on the band on various parts of her body. She was covered in bruises and small welts. He noticed while laying in bed with her, naked, that she had cut herself shaving her legs. Seemingly over and over again. Seemingly as well, purely by accident, like she hadn’t stopped despite the pain of the razor cutting her skin 

Between these fits of rage, and careful observation, Jack hardly saw his wife. She’d been spending time in the basement, a little more everyday. Jack never liked basements, at least not his own. An old house with lots of old house problems. A lot of dark corners. Usually, if Jack knew she was down there he would call to her from the top of the stairs. But during those final days, she would take longer and longer to respond, and would seem more irritated if he had to call to her a few times. And every time, he saw his wife would furiously wash her hands, the soap and water turning a dark color. Jack barely knew what would keep her so deeply interested. But he refused to go down there to find out 

He came home from work during those final minutes of her life, to find her in the kitchen with a knife. She was sobbing, covered in blood and some kind of dark liquid. 

“I don’t want to do this” she cried

“Lydia, what are you talking about?” 

With a shrill cry of anguish, she charged at him. Knife raised, pointed for Jacks neck 

Jack couldn’t remember what happened after that. Except in flashes. The knife clattered to the ground. Lydias nails clawing Jacks face. His face wet with his tears and the blood streaming from his face and off her hands. The black liquid in his mouth, it tasted of painters water and bleach. 

Flashes of a struggle, both struggling, both crying. Then silence 

Jack remembered screaming. Jack remembered the neighbor coming in. Jack remembered hand cuffs 

Jack came to, after being in some form of sedated consciousness for a week, to being sent home a free man with a few bandages. Home security footage proved it was self defense. He needed counseling and other such things for his legal record, but free none the less. Jack didn’t feel free 

Jack felt angry. Jack wanted an explanation. 

Jack stood at the top of the stairs, switching on the light. With barely a second thought, he descended. The basement had various bits of furniture and boxes on shelves. Toats stacked in corners 

But to one corner, the shadows seemed to permeate a darkness so deep it enveloped the area above and below where the walls would meet, where the corner of the room should be 

Jack switched on a second basement light 

In the corner, the darkness was revealed to be.. something. An inky blackness, with an oily sheen to it where the light touched it. But it was floating in the air., and it was formless. In constant motion, bubbling up and emitting a dark mist 

Jack stepped closer and he noticed deeper in the darkness, reflecting off the light was tiny little crystals. He looked closer and he saw an ever shifting portrait of the night sky he looked up too after every night at the bar or a hard days work. Swirling stars, cosmic waves that would take billions of years to perceive from earth, just beneath jacks home. 

Jack reached out, the mist feeling warm against his hand 

He reached further, and touched the swirling black mass 

His brother, Matthew, arrived a few weeks after Jacks wife passed and Jack was released. Having taking upon himself to care for Jack, Matthew brought him food and other home things he thought would simply help his brother keep up with himself and the home. But those final days before he was due to arrive for his brothers sake, phone calls with Jack ended in arguing and sorrow. This made Matthew want to help more, but he had to keep his guard up. He had been jaded by family before

No lights were on in the home. The door was unlocked 

Matthew opened the door, and inside he bore witness to the aftermath of pandemonium. Furniture in disarray, smashed pictures, holes in the wall, and a black liquid splattered on every surface

Matthew stepped further inside, inspecting the chaos, not calling out to anyone at all. For downstairs, he could hear sobbing, but not just one persons. Seemingly many, all crying, their lamentations sending Matthew into a terrified alertness. 

He stepped slowly, soundlessly, past the overturned furniture and broken glass, and reached the basement door, the crying at the apex of its cacophony. As soon as Matthew opened the door, the crying stopped. 

He switched the first light on, illuminating the stairs but making the darkness surrounding more pitch black than anything naturally occurring. He stepped, one by one, descending the stairs. Once he reached the last bit of light, he switched the second light on, and bore witness to the mass. 

He got closer. But before he could even feel a want to reach out, Jack cried out “I DONT WANT TO DO THIS” and shoved Matthew from behind directly into the swirling darkness. 

A sudden shock coursed its way through Matthews body, almost instantly reaching every nerve in his body. The void spread over his entire body, consuming him. 

The crystals within the mass began to cut his skin, little razor marks across his body. His blood mixed with the dark liquid. But Matthew could not feel this 

Darkness became him 

Once he could perceive, its was as if he was seeing through closed eyelids. Pinkish, tannish curtains with little veins spread across the view. But what he saw beyond that veil of flesh was senseless violence. Levels of inhuman depravity Matthew could never perceive. And he can hear it calling to him, the violent nature inside that black void. 

MATTHEW
MATTHEW
MATTHEW
RELEASE YOURSELF MATTHEW
ABANDON THE LIGHT 
BECOME THE PRIMAL DARKNESS WITHIN 

Matthew cried out “I don’t want to do this!!” 

And once again, darkness became him. 

Jack, covered in lacerations and the dark liquid, cried out for his brother through clenched angry teeth 

“MATTHEW IM SORRY” 

He heard a sound from within the mass, like a gurgle but more deliberate. And moments later, Matthew spilled out. He tried to rise, but slipped and knocked into a stack of boxes filled with various pieces of scrap metal and pipe. 

Jack simply cried, and didn’t move towards his brother. He cried “I don’t want to do this” and brandished a knife he had tucked into his belt 

Matthew arose, blood and the black liquid dripping off of him. His tears, clearing the blood and liquid down his cheeks, a dark and crimson mockery of runny makeup 

“Neither do I” he sobbed, brandishing one of the pipes off the ground. 

Darkness became them both.
