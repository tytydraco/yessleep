I passed by the old cemetery today. God, the fact that it's still there is enough to make me shudder. It's all there.

If you're reading this, there's a chance you might be my son. If that's the case, then I have three things to say to you. First is that I'm truly sorry for what you're about to read. Your old man isn't the hero you think he is, nor was he a good man back in the day. I need you to know that I am in no way, shape, or form proud of what I'm about to tell you about. If it were possible to get a do-over, you best damn believe I would.

If you're anybody else, then while I would tell you the same thing, I could really care less as much about what you wanna make of me once this is all over with. Bottom line, son or no, understand both that I've made a lot of wrong decisions in my life, that they've come back to haunt me, that I can no longer live with them, and that... Well...

I know exactly where I'm going...

I was 17, about to be 18 when all of this was first put into motion. About as old as you are now, Noah. I  walked home from school every day, and the cemetery sat right along the outer edge. Hallowed Stone, "Place of peaceful rest". That's what the sign was supposed to say. Over them, though, were the words *"We are The End"*, spraypainted in yellow letters. Those words may as damn well have been what was engraved into the sign anyway, though. Would've made a lot more sense -- anybody that had been laid in those grounds is anything *but* "peaceful".

Whatever "peace" that'd been had in that place died years before, with the first girl. 17-year-old, Samantha Reynolds, found buried in a shallow grave after apparently been Y-sectioned and relieved of all her internal organs. She'd been missing for almost three weeks by the time they'd found her. The neighborhood and the city as a whole went into an uproar. Every night for at least the next month and a half after that, I remember seeing constant reports of the manhunt for Samantha's killer until finally, attention was detracted from her at the discovery of another missing person.

This time it was a 12 year old boy, Levi Edmunson, supposedly nabbed on his way from school. Just like Samantha before him, panic ensued until he, too, was found flayed alive and buried in a shallow grave. Then, before the media would even have a chance to really catch wind of any of this, another little boy went missing, then an adult woman, and so on and so forth. Each time, too, you guessed it, each and every one of them were found the exact same way Samantha was. They became more and more frequent an occurrence, too, with new bodies being found just about every other day for the next three months.

I can also remember the watch parties that were formed because of what was going on. My own folks -- your grandma and grandpa, Noah, even took part in it at one point, taking shifts standing at the gates at nighttime one some weekends. No matter what, though, no one, either guarding Hallowed Stone itself, or whether they were one of the countless groups that decided to make rounds around the neighborhood, could find who it was or keep people from disappearing. Everything went straight to Hell, though, when it was the pastor's daughter that disappeared. Her case was special for a couple reasons.

The first was that she, unlike the former victims, wasn't nabbed off the street anywhere. No, she was abducted, straight from her house. The other thing was that, not only was she in her house, but she wasn't alone. She was supposedly throwing a slumber party or something with two or three other friends when they got her. At least one of the other two were killed and the other was in critical condition when they found her, but she was alive. That was the first time anyone was able to get a lead on the guy doing it, described as a tall, young looking guy, thin, with pale skin and pitch black eyes. She said he moved so quickly that she couldn't ever tell where he was until he was right up on her.

People searched for this guy and the daughter for over a year, with the body count continuing to pile up. Neither, however were ever found, which was also the biggest difference in this particular case. She was, for whatever reason, the only one that *wasn't* found in the cemetery. The killer himself was named by the evening news as "The Demon of Hallowed Stone". By that point, though, people in the neighborhood were more than content to just move out. By the Summertime, there was hardly a third of the residents that lived there from before. That, of course, meant that there was hardly anyone to really hang out with, which led me to wanting to spend time in the cemetery.

Now, understand that it was mostly so I could visit my aunt. I wasn't one of those punks you hear about that liked to sacrifice animals or do stupid shit like that in graveyards. Again, I was just lonely, and I missed my aunt. So, there I was, just trying to sit by her gravesite when I remember hearing a rustling noise coming from the trees of the nearby woods that surrounded it. I looked up and saw nothing at first. The second I turned away, though, I heard it.

*"Come with us, Hank..."*

From the way it sounded, I couldn't tell where the hell it was coming from.

*"Hank... Come with us..."*

*"Join us all, Hank. Join us in the..."*

"Hank!" My head snapped back to the gate. Standing there was momma. "Get your tail outta there right now!" I did a quick double-take between her and the forest before running over to her. She snatched me by my hand and dragged me to the car. "You mind telling me just what in God's name you were doing in there?!"

"I was just sitting with Aunt Rosa, Mom." I remember replying sulkily.

"In there?!" she shrieked, "For God's sake, Hank, do you not pay any fucking attention?"

"Mom, I was just fine, I do this all the ti--"

"The hell you do!" I stopped trying to argue then. That was twice she'd cursed at me in a conversation; a tell-tale sign with that woman that it was best for my future that I just shut the hell up and say "Yes ma'am" and roll with the punches. She told me to get in the car and she sped us the rest of the way home. That whole thing ended with me being told that I was grounded for two weeks and that I was no longer allowed to walk home from school. I'd have to take the bus from now on, which sucked because the kids were obnoxious morons. The rest of that night had my mind divided with two big questions.

First, of course was just how much was I about to hear it from my old man when he got home, you know how that goes, but second, funny enough, was wondering if Momma hadn't just saved me. I started to think of the voices themselves. Particularly at how many there seemed to be. I could hear the voice of both a man and a woman, soft and almost one with the wind. With this, I wondered, *had* I actually heard people whispering at all?

It wouldn't have been *that* far fetched if I was just imagining it, right? All alone in a quiet cemetery, never even mind the fact that it was place like "Hallowed Stone", with it being as windy as it was, AND the fact that Momma had been calling out to me. Could that have been it, then, could I have just been misinterpreting Momma's voice for something else?

Either way, both questions would be answered. The first one was almost immediately when I heard the old station wagon pull into the driveway and he came in. Ironically, I feel like *he* heard it from her more than I had because for about 5 minutes, I heard the two sort of shouting at each other. I couldn't tell whether they were actually *angry* with each other or what. I just pulled the blankets over my head until everything went quiet again. For a moment, all was still until I heard a light knock on the door.

"Come in." The door opened slowly and in stepped my old man. I sighed and said, "Hey Dad."

He sighed and said, "Hey there, buddy." There was another brief moment of silence that weighed down the air in the room. We both looked at each other with the same awkward expression. "So... Do anything fun today?"

I shrugged. "Not really, unless you'd count being bawled out by Momma." He sighed again.

"Yeah, so I hear." He sat down on my bed. "I know you miss your aunt. I do, too, trust me. If it were anywhere else and circumstances were different, I wouldn't have a single care in the world if you wanted to go see her every day from dusk to dawn, but your mother has a point. It ain't safe."

I didn't say anything. Not because I was mad at him, of course, but because, liked it or not, I knew he was right. They both were, essentially. As well as this, though, this also had me thinking about the whispers back in the cemetery again.

Was I actually hearing someone calling out to me from the woods? For what purpose?

Dad patted me on the back and said, "I love you, son. You know you can talk to me if you need to, right?" I nodded and he left. I laid back in my bed. The house was quiet after that for a while, and that was when I heard it again, coming from the back of my mind, or at least, that's what I thought.

*"Hank... He's waiting for you..."*

It was distant at first. Deep and trancelike, too. Then it came closer and lighter, sounding more like a woman's voice.

*"He waits for you, just like the rest of us..."*

Closer and closer, coming from all around me in my room, it felt like. More voices joined in, all repeating more or less the same phrase; men, women, and even *children*, I noticed. None stood out to me, though, more than one in particular.

*"Come back, Hank. We're waiting for you. I'm waiting for you. Come back to the cemetery."*

*Aunt Rosa?*

I shot upright in my bed and swung my head everywhere, breathing heavily. Nothing. An empty, dark, quiet room. I hesitated for a second before getting up and going to my window. Now, this next part is, in a very screwed up sort of way, kind of funny, if only in a morbid way. I was more than half expecting to see absolutely nothing outside my window except the parked cars in the driveway, blanketed by the night sky. A sort of wishful thinking, you could say.

In that vein, it just seems a little "funny" to me, I guess, that, seeing two hooded figures standing outside the house, focusing their gazes right up at my bedroom window, like they were expecting me, that this caused me to instantly seize with terror. One of them, I saw, was staring up at the window with these unnatural red, slitted, sort of snake looking eyes that pierced through the darkness. It was the only feature I could distinguish from either of them. I didn't know what I was supposed to do. I thought about running to Momma and Dad, but then I wondered what would happen then? This belief was then solidified when, after rapidly blinking a few hundred or so odd times, they were gone.

*Huh?* I rubbed my eyes. They weren't there anymore. There was absolutely no sign of them, where they'd gone, or that they'd even been standing there at all. Then again, *had* they been standing there? The question of how much of this wasn't just my head popping a few screws loose on me returned. Just like before in Hallowed Stone, as well as a few seconds ago for that matter, I couldn't help but start to think that this was all just my overall loneliness and want for my Aunt Rosa acting out through my subconscious or something like that. Something psychological, you know?

"Psychological" or not, though, I was scared shitless all the same, not helped by the return of the whispers. I couldn't see anybody, in or outside of the room or the house, who was doing it, but they were there, somewhere, goading me back to Hallowed Stone. That night, I spent in my room, declining to even come out for supper, something I only ever did when I was either sick or *extremely* tired and fell asleep early from an all-night study binge (That's right, Noah, your old man used to actually have a bit of book smarts, too). I'm sure this raised concerns with my folks, but fortunately, I guess they either weren't in the mood to talk to me, or they just knew I wasn't *actually* going to tell them and they decided they'd rather save their breath over a bullshit answer. Can't say I blame them.

All that night, I could hear them, faint and distant, but there. It wouldn't be until that next morning, around maybe 4 or 5:00, give or take, that I could *actually* get any kind of sleep when they all suddenly just dissipated. Just like the figures standing in the driveway just "Dissipated". Vanishing into thin air.

*Like they were never there at all.*

I was lucky, though, that the next day was Saturday, so it's not like I had to actually wake up for anything. It was almost Noon when I did wake up for the day. Also funny, I guess, was the fact that I had absolutely no memory at first of what'd happened the previous night. I remembered the incident in the cemetery, sure, but as far what I saw or experienced in my room afterwards, there was nothing. Well, except for maybe Aunt Rosa's voice as well, which still just faintly rang in my ears, *"We're waiting for you, Hankie..."*

I went into the kitchen for breakfast. Momma was in the middle of cracking the eggs for the standard "breakfast O' champions" for every Saturday morning in my house, growing up: Six-egg omelets, sausage patties, and homemade waffles with a glass of sweet tea. I sat down at the table and started pouring myself a glass of sweet tea when Momma turned around and asked, "How'd you sleep?"

I shrugged. "Alright, I guess." She nodded. The look on her face gave it away that something was up, that there was something she was alluding to. She continued cooking the eggs while I looked outside of the window at her right. It looked as peaceful as ever, and yet, for some reason, that gave it a sort of foreboding feeling to me. I looked back to Momma. Her face was chiseled in a mixed state of worry and concentration.

"I-Is something wrong, Momma?" I asked. She didn't say anything at first, so I asked again. This time, she glanced at me and then back to the pan. "I do something wrong?"

She sighed. "We'll talk in a moment, Hank. Let's at least get breakfast down us first, eh?"

"O-Okay..." I went back to my glass of tea. Dad walked in only a couple seconds later and asked her something about "Have you heard anything more about it yet?" or something like that, to which I, of course, asked, "About what?" Momma then glared at Dad, darting her eyes back and forth between me and him.

He looked at me and awkwardly went "Oh...", inhaling sharply.

"Like I said, we'll talk about it in a minute, okay? Breakfast is almost ready, come sit down." Dad sat at his end of the table while Momma plated the food and set the table. We said grace and for about a solid five or so minutes after that, the three of us ate in complete silence. In that time, I watched Dad and Momma pass awkward glances between themselves and me. Finally, I sat down my fork and asked what was going on.

Dad sighed and replied, "Son, when you were in Hallowed Stone last night, did you maybe see somebody? Talk to anybody?" I shook my head. "You sure?"

"Sweetie, it's okay, I won't be mad." Momma chimed in, "But we need to know."

"No, I promise. I was just visiting Aunt Rosa's grave like I had been." I looked at them. They looked skeptically back at me. "What? Did something happen?"

"Well, somebody was here last night, in the neighborhood and at the house." My eyes swelled.

"What?!"

"Yeah, the uh..." He paused, squinting and snapping his fingers, "Reynold's boy up the street went missing late last night."

"T-Trey?" I shuddered. "Trey Reynolds?" He nodded. "When? how?" He shrugged.

"That's not all, though." Momma said. "Someone was here last night."

"What do you mean?" She looked over to the door that led to the garage.

"This morning, your father and I found your name spraypainted on the car." That was when my heart stopped beating altogether. My body was a statue, fixed upright and perfectly still in my chair. "That's why we need to know, Hank, if you were talking to anybody, anybody at all, in the cemetery last night."

I looked her dead in the face and, mustering every bit of strength I could, I declared as sincerely as I could that I hadn't said anything to anyone in Hallowed Stone that night. I could tell from the looks on their faces that they weren't *entirely* convinced. "Momma, I *promise*\-- no, I *swear,* I WASN'T talking to anybody in the cemetery last night!"

"What about any of the other times you mentioned?" asked Dad.

"No. I told you, I only ever went alone and I never spoke to anyone."

"And no one's ever tried to talk to you?"

"No."

"You notice if anyone's been following you?" I shook my head. Looking back, I think I might've actually started making myself dizzy from how much I'd been shaking it. That, and just how frantically my fucking heart thundered in my chest. My thoughts were in a cyclone, with every worst imaginable scenario playing out simultaneously, all flashing in my head.

I imagined the figures in the driveway from last night, staring up at me. Waving at me. Goading me.

*"Come join us, Hank..."*

*"He's waiting for you, Hank."*

*"We're all waiting for you, Hank..."*

I thought of Aunt Rosa's voice again. Why did it sound like her? It couldn't actually *be her*, could it?

My thoughts then further derailed, thinking about Trey. Now, Trey was known to sneak out at night sometimes. Especially if there was a party being talked about at school that weekend at somebody's house -- which there was. So, okay, yeah, that *could've* explained that, except then why hadn't he returned home?

If you're not my son reading this, you're probably thinking he just got too wasted to walk back home again, right? I would have agreed with you, except then how could he have been taken?

"Trey, are you sure he's missing? I mean, there *was* a party last night and--"

"We know, and so did his folks." Dad said. "The Satton's house, right?" I nervously nodded my head. "Yeah, folks said he'd already called and said he was comin' home about two or three hours before they reported him."

"Have the cops been called? Has anything been found?"

He sighed and replied, "Yeah, but they won't really be able to do anything until tonight, when he'll have been gone for a full 24 hours." He let out a dry laugh. I could feel myself starting to hyperventilate. Dots started connecting and the world began to spin.

*Last night... but that was also when...*

I looked to the door to the driveway. It didn't take a genius to realize that they must've nabbed him before or after they came to my house. They either had to have seen him walking by, as his house was close by to mine, or them being there must have been a message to me, sort of a fucked up "We got one of your little friends, Ha, Ha" type of thing.

*"We're waiting for you, Hank..."*

"Hank? Hank?" Dad's voice faintly cut through the Halestorm that was my mind. I felt him start to shake me, "Hank!"

"Huh?" I looked back to him and Momma, startled. They matched my look of confusion and anxiety with ones of growing concern. "You okay, bud?"

"Um... Y-yeah... Yeah, I..." I was interrupted by a knock at the front door. The three of us at once snapped our heads in the direction of the front door. We all exchanged glances at one another before Dad got up and went to the door.

A couple seconds later, I heard Dad call out to the kitchen, "Hank, It's for you." I hesitated for a second before slowly standing up and trudging Zombie-like to the living room. Dad stood in the doorway, in front of my friend, Nolan Peters.

"Hey dude!" he exclaimed. "Wanted to see if you could hang out for a bit." I looked at Dad.

"Oh... Well, I mean, I'd *like* to, but I'm kinda grounde--"

"Oh go on.*"* Dad said, grinning sightly. I looked at him, eyebrows raised. "Go on, have fun."

"B-But what about--" He waved his hand.

"It's fine, I'll handle that, you just go and have fun, buddy." I grinned and went to the door. before reaching the door, though, Dad stopped me by softly taking my arm and said "Just stay away from Hallowed Stone, okay?"

"Yes sir." He winked and let me go and me and Nolan bolted out across the yard. We were halfway down the road leading away from the house before we slowed down.

"So, what've you been up to?" asked Nolan.

"Nothing, really."

"Hey, so, what were you about to tell me earlier at the door, anyway? Something about you being grounded?" I looked at him.

"Yeah, what about it?"

"Well what for?" I scoffed.

"It was nothing, dude. Momma got pissed at me when she found me in the cemetery."

"You were in Hallowed Stone?" he asked, sounding for some reason genuinely confused.

"Yeah, and? Dude, I'm *always* there."

"Alone?"

"Yeah."

"Dude, what the heck, you never brought me along?" He delivered a slight, playful punch to my shoulder. I just stared confused back at him.

"What does it matter?" I asked.

"Well, I mean, what if you saw the Black-eyed man the cops have been lookin' for?" My heart started to quicken, though I kept walking, not wanting to let it show.

"Okay, and?"

"And you would've caught all that *without ME*, your best buddy?" I was given another playful punch in the shoulder for this, this one albeit noticeably harder than the last.

"*Sor-ry,"* I replied sarcastically, "If it makes you feel any better, I haven't seen any "Black-eyed people" or anything like that." I paused for a second.

*At least not while I was IN the cemetery...*

"I've just been visiting my Aunt Rosa. She was buried there."

"Oh yeah, I remember that now."

"Yeah, well anyway, Momma caught me out there last night and was PISSED, so I was--"

"Hey, you hear about Trey last night?" I paused again. The shiver was a bit more noticeable this time when it traveled up my back.

"Y-Yeah, why?"

"I was actually *at* that party last night, man." he exclaimed. "I saw him there, too. I remember seeing him leave when I was."

"Where did you see him go?"

"Back toward his house, why?" I didn't answer. The feeling was eating away at me more and more. Trey's house was just a little way down the neighborhood from my house, and only a few feet from Hallowed Stone itself. I realized in my head that, if my prediction of events was right, it would've been nothing at all for the "Black-eyed man" and who or whatever the hell else was with him to snatch Trey, drag him away to God only knew where, and then be there at my house like they were.

"What time?" I asked shakily.

"Uh... I-I don't know, maybe like..." He grimaced, rubbing his forehead and inhaling sharply. "Maybe like, 12, 1:00, something like that, why?" I shook, remaining silent. I saw him look over at me. "Dude, are you okay? You look like you're about to have a heart attack."

I looked at him. I didn't know what to tell him. He was my friend, sure, but I didn't feel like telling him what I saw last night was a good idea. I didn't want to lie to him -- I don't like lying to *anyboody* \-- but I had the bad feeling that if I did tell him, especially given his reaction earlier when I told him about how I'd visit my aunt there in Hallowed Stone on a regular basis, "without him", that he'd try and talk me into going there on some search for the "Back-eyed man" or something. "I-I'm fine, it's--"

*"Hank!"*

I swung my head around behind me. It sounded like whoever it was was hurt or running from something, crying for help. I couldn't see anybody, though. "Hank?" Nolan asked, "You okay?" I didn't answer.

*"Hank! I need you!"*

*What the hell?* I thought, swinging my head now in the other direction. Again, no one there. I began to feel Nolan nudge my arm. "D-Dude?"

I lightly batted his hand away, sighing, and said, "Yeah, yeah, dude, I-I'm fine, just..." My eyes opened to see Nolan frozen in place, face white as a sheet, staring at the space to my right. "You okay?" I asked. This time, *he* was the one that didn't answer. I slowly turned around to see, to my utter terror, three hooded figures standing on the other side of the street across from us.

For a moment, the five of us stood, staring at one another. Suddenly, the one in the middle raised their arm and pointed at me. My heart pounded harder and harder at this. *Why is he pointing at me?!*

*"Hank, come with us."* From the corner of my eye, I saw Nolan turn and look at me.

I could hear the woman's voice from before say, *"Hank, we need you!"*

"Dude, do you know them?" I looked at Nolan. He could hear them, too. I shook my head and looked back to the figures. The figure in the middle took two steps toward us, hand still outstretched. I saw his hand turn over into a gesture like he wanted something.

*"Take my hand, child."* I heard in the deep voice. I backed away, seeing him continue toward me.

"Wh-Who are you?" I managed to stutter out. He stopped, about midway into the road in between the other sidewalk where the others were and my side with me and Nolan.

*"Take my hand, Hank."* he said, his arm somehow seeming to stretch further and further out toward me, despite his body not moving at all. My eyes darted back and forth between Nolan and the other two figures. *"Take my hand, join us, Hank. He waits for you."*

"Wh-Who?" This was when he started taking steps toward me again, and I started backing away again.

*"He waits for you, Hank. He waits to be completed. He will have us all."*

"Who? What the hell are you talking about?" Nolan exclaimed, stepping in front of me. The figure turned to face him, dropping his hand. "Look, whoever you and your little group of weirdos are, just go away and--"

He got no further when the figure then removed his hood and revealed himself to be a bald man with gaunt, ghostly white skin and two marbled eyes sunken in their sockets. Nolan and I both instantly went breathless in fear. A smile stretched across the man's face, spreading so unnaturally wide that I'd sworn I could see the skin actually tear itself wider and wider across his cheeks, exposing black, diseased looking gums and jagged, shark-like teeth.

His arm raised again and his eyes refocused to me. "Come, Hank, It's time to join us." His voice was somehow amplified with the removal of his hood. I felt a growing surge kicking through my legs to take off behind me, but for some reason, I couldn't move. My body was telling me to run like Hell, but my mind was telling me to stay put. He crept further forward.
