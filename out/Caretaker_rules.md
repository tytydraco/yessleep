Hello there! You must be our new winter caretaker. At Ayrton Hotel, we have plenty of fun activities for all, including a beach front and hiking trails! Our glamorous hotel is a fun stay, our vintage look and over the top entertainment can not only make for a great family vacation, but also a romantic getaway or retirement holiday. Nonetheless, Ayrton stays closed during the winter, and we require someone to keep our beloved property clean, secure, and well maintained! As our caretaker, you may stay in the suit and have the entirety of the hotel to yourself, but there are a list of rules you must follow. 

1. Our custodians have made sure to clean the property well, keep it this way. 

2. You may use the main kitchen for food. There is access to months worth of food and supplies in the freezer and fridge, but be sure to lock the freezer up and turn off the stoves and grills after every use. 

3. The hiking trails need to be trended to, there is a snowblower in the main shed at the back of the property you must use to clear the snow. Be sure to do this at exactly 3:34pm every two days. No earlier, no later.

4. You may hear a woman screaming from the trails after dark, do not investigate. If you chose to investigate, refer to rule 13.

5. Our park ranger will check in with you via radio every week, his name is Rodger. If anyone other than Rodger tries to contact you, do not answer. The radio is located in the main office. 

6. Do not leave the premises, anyone who enters may not leave until your stay is over. If any intruders happen to enter the property, contact Rodger. He will phone the authorities. 

7. Do not enter the guest hall after 7pm. 

8. You may enter any of the rooms to check in on cleanliness, do not enter Room 213. You will be tempted to when passing it, do not give into this temptation.

9. You are welcome to help yourself to the bar located in the guest hall, do not accept drinks from the bartender. You are the only person on the property. We do not have a bartender. 

10. Keep yourself company, it may get lonely the next 4 months! Remember, you are the only person on the property. 

11. Guests and past caretakers have reported seeing two girls roaming the halls after dark. If you see these girls, ignore them.

12. If you feel like you are being watched, do not turn around. 

13. If you are referring to this rule, kill yourself. There is a rifle locked in the main office under the carpet, the key is located in the bottom left drawer on the information desk. This will be a quicker and much less painful death than what is awaiting you. 

14. You may hear strange noises coming from the basement, if you chose to investigate, refer to rule 13.

15. Be careful when roaming the beachfront, the ice gets slippery and if you hit your head, there is no one here to help you. 

16. If you see rain outside, do not leave the building. This is not rain. 

17. If the rain turns red, refer to rule 13. 

18. You may start to feel anxious and/or crazy. You may start to see things. This is normal as you will be alone for a few months, but donâ€™t worry, Rodger will always be there to talk. Remember, you are the only one on the property. 

19. You are not alone on the property. 

That does it for our rules! Be sure to have a fun and safe stay at Ayrton Hotel!
