My thoughts were swimming, my mind grasping at questions I could hardly form—let alone ask. 

*Wit’s happened tae Mum and Dad?*

*Why are Eilidh’s eyes brown?*

*How the fuck is Eilidh even here.* 

“Wits happened tae Mum and Dad?” I blurted out, my voice rasping like my vocal chords were made of sandpaper—harsher than I meant—before Eilidh even had the chance to sit down. 

She paused, then gave me a gentle smile. “Aye, they did say you hid a concussion. You really don’t mind?”

“Eilidh, a spoke to them aboot two days ago.” I snapped. “Wit’s there tae remember?”

Eilidh’s smile faltered a little. Just enough. 

“They… they died, Brodie. The car crash, mind? Aboot 10 year ago.”

My heart stopped. “Is this a fucking joke?”

I remembered the phone call. Two days ago. I remembered Mum asking me if I’d packed spare socks. 

So either I was losing my mind… or Eilidh was lying.

But the way she looked at me—like she was genuinely worried for me—it threw me. This wasn’t some sort of trick. She believed it. 

The room started spinning, my tongue sticking to the top of my mouth like velcro, 

*None ae this is possible.*

“I… need some water,” I muttered.

Smiling again, she quickly said “Don’t you worry, ah’ll get you some.” 

And as she passed me the glass, I noticed something else. 

Her reflection in the window. 

It wasn’t smiling.

It was staring directly at me. 

My hands trembled as I took the glass from her and brought it to my lips. I drank the whole thing before I realised how hollow my stomach felt. 

I was starving. Dehydrated. 

Insane?

“Listen, this is aw a bit much for someone who’s just about died on the side of a mountain. Why don’t you get a wee kip and ah’ll go source us a munch?” Eilidh said, as she grabbed her stuff and headed for the door. 

The whole time, I hadn’t been able to stop staring at her reflection in the window. 

It looked… pained. 

Like it was mourning. 

While the Eilidh in front of me smiled and spoke softly, the one in the glass mouthed something—again and again, lips forming the same silent loop, her face growing more frantic the closer she got to the door.

I couldn’t figure it out in time. She was gone before I could even try. 

And just like that—I was alone.

The machines beeped slowly, a lazy, uneven rhythm. The air smelled sharply of antiseptic and something else—damp stone, maybe. Like the mountain had followed me inside. 

I stared at the window where Eilidh’s reflection had been. The glass warped the empty chair she’d sat in, stretching it thin. My head throbbed, but I couldn’t look away. The reflection hadn’t matched her. Hadn’t moved with her.

*Wit wis she tryin tae say?* 

I replayed it in my mind—the frantic mouthing, the pleading eyes. The lips had moved in a loop. Three syllables, maybe four. 

*Ah’ve… got…*

I mouthed the words silently, testing them. No, that didn’t fit. 

*It’s no me.*

That's what the reflection had been screaming. Over and over. 

I tried to say it aloud, but my throat was raw. *It’s no me.*

The realisation hit me like a punch to the chest.

*It’s no me.*

My hands shook. I had to move. *Now.*

I swung my legs off the bed—and collapsed onto the floor. My muscles refused to hold me. Pain lanced through my ribs, and I gasped, curling in on myself like a wounded animal.

From down here, the room looked wrong. The bed loomed over me like a cliff. I strained to look out the door but all I caught was a sliver of the hallway.

Then I heard it. 

A wet, sliding sound. Something heavy moving across the linoleum. But it had a rhythm—not a scrape, but a step. 

Something was coming. 

I clawed at the bedframe, hauling myself up just enough to see properly through the doorway. 

The sound stopped.

A nurse stepped into view. 

She looked normal—scrubs, ID badge, a polite smile. But she didn’t move to help. Just stood there, watching me struggle, her head tilted like a dog seeing something strange for the first time. Like I was a curiosity.

“Need a haun?” she asked. Her voice was syrupy—too warm, almost sickly sweet.

My skin prickled. “Aye. Please.”

She stepped forward, but her movements were wrong. Not like someone in pain—more like someone wearing a body that didn't quite fit. Every step looked deliberate, as if she had to think it through. 

Her hands were feverish when they touched me—like metal left out in the sun. The heat clung to my skin, long after she let go. She tucked the sheets around me with exaggerated, careful precision.

“There ye are," she said., easing me back into the pillows with slow, deliberate hands.

"You’ve had quite the ordeal, hint ye?”

I nodded, throat tight. 

“Cin a get ye anything else, doll?” she asked. “Water? Another wee blanket?”

“Naw,” I spat out. “Am sound, ta.” 

She smiled. Too wide. Not friendly—more like a primate baring its teeth. A show of dominance.

“Sweet dreams, hen.”

As she turned to leave, I caught her reflection in the window. 

The thing in the glass was not human. 

Its grin split its face ear to ear, needle-thin teeth bared. Its eyes were black pits, unblinking. And its neck—

Its neck twisted, craning toward me even as the nurse walked away. The reflection bent further with every step.

The door clicked shut.

Silence. 

The wet, sliding steps receded down the hallway. I held my breath until the sound disappeared into the hospital’s white noise—the distant beeps and whirrs that somehow made the quiet worse. Only then did my ribs expand, air rushing in like I’d surfaced from deep water.

I couldn't leave. Couldn’t even lift my legs without white-hot pain searing through my body. The realisation settled like a stone in my gut. 

I was trapped here. 

With whatever wore that nurse’s face. 

With whatever wore Eilidh’s skin.

My eyelids drooped, heavy as moorland rocks. I fought it—dug my nails into my palms until I drew blood—but my body was shutting down. The mountain had taken its toll. Then the storm. Now this.

Here I was—starving and terrified—yet some stupid, primal part of me still wanted Eilidh to come back with a hot chippy. To smile and say it was all some concussion dream. 

Maybe it was. 

Maybe when I woke—

Darkness spidered its way in from the edges of my vision.

*Naw. Please, naw.*

I tried to sit up, to move, to do anything—but my body was lead. Every part of me screamed to stay awake, to not let go.

My breath hitched. My heart hammered in my ears.

*What if it comes back?*

But it was already happening.

My body gave out—heavy, useless. My eyelids, heavier with every blink.

I didn’t want to sleep. Not here. Not now. 

But I didn’t have a choice.

The lights flickered—then died.

The machines cut off mid-beep—the hospital's low hum vanished, and silence rushed in like a vacuum.

Wet steps.

Fast. Deliberate. 

As if it knew I couldn’t help but sleep. 

I was trapped in my own skin—helpless—as the door handle creaked. 

I strained to open my eyes one last time, but they were welded shut with exhaustion. 

The last thing I felt before everything went black was the unmistakable weight of someone standing over me.

Watching.
