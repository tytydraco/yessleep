I work for my best friend Mitch. This is about him. Or, about who he became. When I think of Mitch, I think of the man he used to be. That is not the man you will be meeting in this recollection of him.

•

Mitch went on vacation in Alaska after his divorce. While he was there—after he’d already had the chance to see the Northern Lights, watch humpback whales from a fishing boat, and gone on a flightseeing tour over the glaciers and fjords—he was attacked by a walrus.

What’s even crazier is that it happened inside his hotel. Because, do you know how many walruses have attacked people inside of hotels? Neither do I, and I think the reason for that is that there is no such number, because it has never happened.

I saw a video of the attack taken by another hotel guest. The footage is all shaky; sometimes you can see what happens head-on, sometimes it’s more like those police bodycam videos where the camera drops while they’re detaining someone.

It was bonkers.

It was a weird-looking walrus. It looked like it had been starved, which I thought was impossible because of their blubber. Its front and back flippers were closer to quadrupedal limbs with articulated hands than flippers. And I swear, its skin was rotting off. It must have had a flesh-eating disease or something.

The video is shaky as hell, but there’s one part that’s as clear as can be:

The walrus walked into the lobby through a plate glass door, shattering it with its weight. There was a leisureliness to its gait, even as the glass shards just about exploded in the air, hotel patrons screaming all the while.

It moved through the lobby on its weird limbs more like a three-toed sloth than a marine mammal.

It saw Mitch. And for a minute, Mitch and the walrus just stared at each other. Then, I shit you not, it sounded like the walrus was trying to sing a very sad song. Mitch listened to the “song” with his eyes closed, swaying to the music. His dance was mechanical, like a wind-up toy, the movement of a man under hypnosis.

Mitch then turned his back to face the walrus. It looked like a courtship ceremony between radiation-addled creatures who’d survived a nuclear meltdown; like a Chernobyl wedding between two wild dogs. The walrus approached Mitch and got up behind him. Mitch did not move at all except to sway to the beast’s strange song.

The walrus jumped up and came back down much faster than I would’ve guessed it could, and it sunk its tusks deep into Mitch’s back. He screamed so loud that the sound of the video played through my phone almost busted the speaker. Despite the nature of Mitch’s screams—I imagined the pain was excruciating—he also, at least it seemed to me, moaned in pleasure.

Crazy shit, right?

It had been a while by the time Mitch flew back home. They wouldn’t move him back Stateside until he’d healed up for air travel.

After Mitch came back from Alaska, he changed. A lot.

•

My part in all this began on a trip to the zoo. We all went together—me, Mitch, and his sister Lala (Yolanda).

Lala had medical needs (she was left paraplegic after a bad car accident during high school) and Mitch spent a lot of money on her: a power wheelchair, a luxury hospital bed, the works. Mitch’s then-wife didn’t appreciate the little money her then-husband made flying right out the window faster than it came in the door, and told both him and his “cripple sister” that they could take a hike.

I’ve known Lala almost as long as Mitch. It wasn’t so unusual then, when Mitch had to take a phone call during our little field trip, that me and Lala did our own thing and went to the other animal exhibits.

Also, we were having sex (not while we were in the zoo, of course). I include that information primarily because it helps explain some of what follows, and, secondarily, for the simple reason that I think it’s great, and didn’t mind people knowing it. Except for Mitch. Mitch could not, and, if I had anything to do with it, absolutely would not ever-ever know that I was sleeping with his sister.

“Hold my hand,” she said. I sat on a bench with her chair next to my seat, as we ate cotton candy near the giraffe paddock. “Let’s go feed the giraffes.”

“No,” I said, but quickly kissed her on the cheek. I liked Lala a lot.

“No to which? Holding my hand or feeding the giraffes?”

“Yes to the giraffes. We can’t do PDA within five square miles of Mitch while he’s conscious or about to be conscious.”

She picked off a piece of my cotton candy. “You’re going to have to tell Mitchie eventually.”

“Well, I don’t know a Mitchie. I know a Mitch. And the Mitch I know would rip my intestines out of my asshole and use them to strangle me if he knew I was his sister’s boyfriend.”

“I’m your girlfriend?” She smiled.

“You know, if you want to be, yeah.”

She seemed to think about this for a few seconds. “And you’re sure it’s not that you just don’t want to hold hands with a cripple in public?”

“Lala, that’s a very stupid thing for a very smart person to say. The only reason we’re not holding hands is because if Mitch-not-Mitchie knew that I’ve been going around with you behind his back, he would punch me hard enough to turn my teeth into the leftover chalk they have to wipe out of the ledges under grade school chalkboards.”

Lala laughed. “You use very evocative imagery when you describe someone very badly injuring you.”

I looked at my hands. “Shit, I’m all sticky.”

She handed me a wet wipe. “Here.”

“Thanks.” I wiped my hands, eyebrows cocked. “Where were you keeping that?”

“A lady never tells.” Lala stuck out her tongue.

“Where do you want to go next?” I said.

“Baby seals?” she said.

“Shit yeah. I can get down with some baby seals.”

•

“They seem pretty peaceful,” Lala said as we watched the baby seals through the enclosure’s aquarium glass. She looked up at me. “Don’t they?”

“Yeah. They seem pretty chill.”

“But they’re so big up close. Even the babies. That must’ve been so scary for Mitch…” Lala frowned and turned to watch the seals again.

“Well, you know, these are seals.”

“Still,” she said.

“I think there was something wrong with the walrus that attacked Mitch.” I looked in Lala’s eyes. “Like, it was diseased or insane or something.”

Lala pointed up toward the top of the aquarium tank. “Speaking of,” she said, “is a walrus supposed to be in the same tank as the baby seals?”

I followed to where Lala was pointing and, sure enough, a walrus had entered the tank with the seal pups. The enclosure was open-air on the level above us—for the zoogoers who liked to watch the seals lounge on the rocks between jumping in and out of the water; the sun shone from that level into the water and you could see the animals very, very clearly.

The walrus swam closer above the pups. It moved in tighter circles around the juvenile pod. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that the walrus was menacing them.

“What is it doing?” Lala said. “Why is it doing that?” She looked up at me.

“I’m—I’m sure it’s fine. You know, I’m sure they know what they’re doing.”

“The animals or the zookeepers?” Lala said. I didn’t answer.

I heard the murmur and rumble that precedes shouting, just as calm precedes a storm. I looked behind me and saw two zoo employees arguing while one of them yelled into a walkie talkie.

Lala shrieked. I turned around again and saw her pointing into the tank. Mitch was naked and inside the water.

“Petey. Petey—what the hell is he doing?”

I couldn’t answer. I shook my head in disbelief.

We were all helpless to watch what unfolded next.

Mitch swam way faster than I’d ever seen him (or any other human being) swim, orbiting over and under the seal pups. The walrus closed the horizontal perimeter it circled around the baby seals at the same time. The baby seals made sudden dodges—they looked like they were trying to escape—only to be cut off by Mitch and the walrus.

I squinted my eyes at Mitch as he swam. He was different. His arms and legs had lengthened; his feet and hands were flattened (which explained why he could swim so fast). The more frightening change, however, was that there were two huge, long, sharp teeth protruding downward from Mitch’s upper jaw.

Lala’s voice was swollen with panic. “Why is he in there? What is he doing? Petey,” she said, tugging my shirt, “why is he doing that?”

I shook my head. The part of my brain controlling speech was overridden by my stupefaction. With great effort, I managed to shallowly say, “I don’t know.”

Mitch suddenly dived for one of the seal pups, scaring it back into the center of the orbit it was trying to escape. Everyone looking through the aquarium glass gasped. Children giggled, not understanding what might be happening; they whined when parents with good instincts pulled them away.

“Mitch, stop,” Lala almost whispered, to nobody, or to herself. “Stop, stop.” Soon she’d be screaming.

Then it happened.

Mitch and the walrus dove for the same seal pup. The others scattered, leaving the weak one behind.

Mitch sunk his two huge teeth into the seal pup’s face, and came away with a seal pup eye skewered on one long tooth. The walrus got a hold of the pup’s hind flippers at the same time, and ripped one off.

The seal pup was rudderless, started flailing. The baby seal made terrible sounds. It yowled and cried, injured and unable to flee. When Mitch and the walrus attacked it again, it began shrieking.

Lala was screaming, but I was outside my own body as I watched it all happen.

Blood clouded over the tank. Pretty soon, there was only the sound of the seal pup screaming as Mitch and the walrus shredded it to pieces. Its wailing came from inside a fog of blood. Then, finally, there was no sound. And that might have been the worst moment of all.

•

Mitch disappeared before the workers at the zoo or the cops could catch him. A detective was assigned to the case and, of course, interviewed Lala.

Over the course of the next few days, Lala got updates from the detective.

Detective Schumaker reminded me of my high school English teacher more than a gumshoe. She wore a beaded neck cord for her glasses, which were John Lennon imitation frames.

The detective’s working theory, she shared with me and Lala, was that they hadn’t caught Mitch because he’d fled into the river. They could patrol, and send the odd scuba diver, but were otherwise hamstrung. “We’ll have to wait until he reaches dry land,” she said (which fit the circumstance but seemed like a funny thing to say).

A temporary police patrol posted up outside Lala’s house.

Lala was edging in toward psychological collapse. She took a leave of absence from the school where she taught. I stayed with her while she tried to pick up the pieces.

I didn’t plan to find happiness hiding in tragedy, but I liked being close to Lala; I liked sleeping in the same house. She relied on me. I appreciated that it brought us much closer, that much quicker. Does that make me a sicko? I don’t know, and I’m not sure I care.

About a month went by. They pulled the police patrol from Lala’s house. The detective apologized even though it wasn’t her decision. The police department was under pressure because the city had a budget shortfall.

Lala pulled herself back together pretty quick. She went back to work. When she seemed ready, I said she could give me the boot, if she wanted her space. She answered with a firm, “No.” Lala started directing detours to my apartment, where she instructed what I should bring over to her place. We reached the tipping point where her house had more of my stuff in it than in my own apartment.

Despite Mitch still missing, and the lingering trauma of the terror at the zoo, things seemed to be returning to as close to normal as they could get.

But that’s all that that change was: something that only seemed.

•

Someone knocked on the front door. Lala yelled to me from the kitchen. “I think that might be the pizza delivery guy, Peter, can you get it?”

“I’m on it.”

I opened the front door. Detective Schumaker was standing there holding a file box.

“Detective. How’s it going? I didn’t know you were coming. I would’ve given you guys privacy to talk.”

She awkwardly balanced the file box between her hefty stomach and the door jamb. “I’ve got Lala’s things. You know, the stuff we took with the warrant? We found nothing—not that I expected to find anything. Thought I’d bring it all back myself.”

“Here, I can take it.” I held out my hands and she gave me the box. “You want to come in and say hi?”

Detective Schumaker looked past me into the house. “Well, I don’t want to bother Yolanda. I don’t really have any updates—”

“Come in, come in!” Lala said behind me. She’d heard the detective’s voice.

“Okay,” Schumaker said. “Just for a minute.” She came inside.

“We have pizza coming, if you want,” Lala said.

Schumaker patted her belly and said, “You know, I probably shouldn’t. Me and Mr. Schumaker are trying for another baby. The last one had gestational diabetes. And I’m too fat anyhow.”

“You are not,” Lala said.

“You know, part of my job is to spot when people are lying,” the detective said with an impish smile, “and I’m pretty good at it.”

“Hey, why don’t you sit with the detective, and I’ll put away your computer and whatever else?” I said to Lala, nodding down to the file box.

“Sure,” Lala said and pulled the detective’s arm along with her chair, “here, come in the kitchen. Just a little chit-chat, I won’t keep you long.”

I went into Lala’s room to put her things away.

What happened next seemed to stretch out time. Maybe my internal clock slowed because I thought I was going to die (or that we were all going to die). After the police reviewed Lala’s Ring camera footage, they said it all happened in a shade under thirty seconds.

I watched through Lala’s front-yard-facing window as the pizza delivery guy walked up to the house. He rang the doorbell. I heard Schumaker say, “I’ll get it.” Lala argued with Schumaker. “I insist,” I heard Schumaker say.

I heard Schumaker’s footsteps near the front door. Through the window I saw a dark figure sprinting toward the delivery guy from a hundred feet out. I couldn’t see who or what it was in the evening dark. But without even seeing, I knew.

I heard Schumaker open the front door and yell back to Lala. “Pizza!”

I ran out of the bedroom toward the front of the house. I came behind Schumaker—she faced the pizza delivery guy—the front door was open. I saw Mitch. He was naked and booking it, flying headlong toward Lala’s front door.

My feet were frozen. I watched, helpless, paralyzed inside myself.

Mitch sunk his tusks into the delivery guy’s neck. Detective Schumaker reached for her gun. Mitch pulled his tusks backward and came away with a meaty chunk of the delivery guy’s neck. A neighbor screamed. Lala’s power chair moved somewhere behind us.

Mitch was a true monster now. He was almost two feet taller than he used to be. His tusks looked elephantine on his still-somewhat-human head. His hands and feet were massive shovels with fingers. He was fast. Mitch was so fast.

The detective fired. A bullet punctured Mitch’s cheek. A spray of red mist and meat exploded into the air. Mitch roared—roared low, terrible—a nightmare creature’s sound. Neighbors screamed outside, more of them now. The delivery guy hit the ground—blood squirted from the crater in his neck. Lala screamed behind me. Schumaker fired two more times. Mitch hit the detective’s hand hard enough to break bones. The sound went SNAP. It was loud. Lala screamed. Schumaker screamed. The neighbors screamed.

I didn’t scream. I watched. I only watched.

Detective Schumaker turned to dive for her gun. Mitch hit her. His hand connected with her face like a sledgehammer smashing into a cinder block. Lala screamed. The detective’s head hid the wooden edge of a wall clock. Bone crunched. The bone of the detective’s skull crunching was loud. Lala screamed. Schumaker collapsed.

There was blood on the wall; meat, blood and bone, on the edge of the wall clock. Lala screamed. Pieces of Schumaker’s skull were scattered on the carpet. There were brains on the wall. Lala screamed.

I turned and I ran for Lala. Now I screamed. “Get out!” I rushed through the open entryway to the kitchen. Before I rounded after Lala, I looked back one last time. Mitch’s naked body was bent beside Schumaker’s on the floor. He was disemboweling her with his tusks.

Mitch bayed, his bloody tusks covered in ropes of intestine as he raised his head and howled. Lala screamed.

I picked Lala up out of her chair. I felt for my keys in my pocket. It didn’t feel like me doing those things. I was in someone else’s body. Mitch roared. I heard his mutated feet making thunder on the floorboards. Neighbors hollered outside the house. I opened the door to the garage. Mitch roared. Lala screamed. I closed the garage door after we were in the garage.

I threw Lala into the passenger seat. I ran around the car. Mitch broke through the garage door from inside the kitchen. The doorway practically exploded. Lala screamed. I turned the key in the ignition. Wood chips hit the car body and the far wall. It sounded like someone throwing scraps out a fifty-story-high window, watching the impact near-detonate the sidewalk.

The engine turned. I put it in gear.

And then, suddenly, we were moving sideways. Lala screamed.

Mitch hit his shoulder into the car again. The car was pinned. The car was somehow pinned. I hit the accelerator. The tires burned out. Smoke flew from the tires. Lila screamed. The car was pinned.

The passenger door was ripped off next to Lila. Lila screamed. Mitch’s head appeared through rubber smoke. He reached for Lila. I tried to stop him.

Mitch sank his tusks into my arm. Mitch impaled my forearm with both his tusks. I screamed and I screamed. Mitch pulled his tusks away, and there was a sharp pain. There was a sound like a bowl of Jell-O being dumped on the floor, too. There was a sound like ten dogs jaws’ snapping ten dried, smoked pig ears in half. Blood sprayed all over my face. Lala screamed. Blood sprayed all over Lala’s face, all over Mitch’s face.

Mitch reached and pulled Lala out of the car. Lala screamed.

My vision tunneled closed. The world was turning black.

Lala screamed.

•

I woke up days later in the hospital. Lala was waiting in her power chair by my bed. Mitch had let her go.

Lala never told me what she said to her brother to stop him from taking her, and I never asked. I like to think that Mitch recovered his humanity long enough to do the right thing. As likely as not, I’ll never know the answer.

It’s been years since all of this, and I can count on one hand the number of times we’ve talked about Mitch. After everything that happened, Lala has a deep, dark hole inside of her. I try to help by filling it with love (as moronic and cliché as that sounds).

I lost my arm. But Mitch’s ex-wife bought me a fairly bang-up prosthetic. Help comes from unexpected places (please pardon my further triteness).

I’m only writing now about what happened because Lala received a recent call about Mitch. I saw her face when the man on the other end started explaining himself. I knew she was going to hand me the phone before she even handed it to me and said, “I can’t do it.”

The call was from a Mountie in the Northwest Territories. They’d found Mitch’s truck abandoned in a town as far north as you can drive on the continent, a little more than ninety miles from where the Arctic began.

“We didn’t find much, but we fished around the truck and found a burner phone. This was the only number in the contacts; don’t think he ever called it, though. So, she’s his sister, huh?”

“Yeah.” I was quiet. I was stunned.

“We’re looking for him right now, so any information you can provide would be helpful toward that end.”

“Uh-huh.” I couldn’t say anything else.

After a minute, the Mountie said, “I understand this is probably very upsetting. So take your time and think about it. You can call me back.”

“Sure,” I said. “Yeah.”

“Well, I’ll let you go. Like I said, call me back when you can. Any help is appreciated, this being a sort of strange case and all. I’ll tell you,” the Mountie said, and nervously chuckled, “I’m sort of gobsmacked by it. There was a huge bucket of clam shells in the passenger seat, all of the meat eaten out of them. And we found something written down on a Hallmark card inside an envelope, postage already on it.”

I asked him if it was Lala’s name and address on the envelope.

“Yessir, that’s the name and that’s the address,” the Mountie said. “We looked at the card. There was nothing on it except a few lines from a poem.”

“A poem?” I said.

“Yessir, a poem. By Lewis Carroll—you know, fella that wrote the Alice in Wonderland stories?”

“What poem?” I said. “What did it say?”

*'The time has come,' the Walrus said,*

*'To talk of many things:*

*Of shoes—and ships—and sealing-wax—*

*Of cabbages—and kings—*

*And why the sea is boiling hot—*

*And whether pigs have wings.'*
