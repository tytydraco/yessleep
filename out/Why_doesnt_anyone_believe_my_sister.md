Why doesn't anyone believe my sister?



My sister has been pregnant for a long time and nobody believes her.



It all started with three words, those three words that were the trigger of the absolute hell, those three words came to break my life into pieces and those three words were.



\-Sister, I am pregnant.



My sister Monica had trusted me to confess that secret and the next few days were the best, even though we couldn't keep up with naming the baby and planning how we would tell my parents our relationship grew closer, I will always thank that ball of flesh for allowing me to have such a good time with my sister.



The only problem with telling my parents was that as with most teenage mothers the father had fled when he heard the news which would make it that much harder to explain.



But our parents' reaction was not anger or happiness, their reaction was laughter so out of place it was terrifying, that laughter went on for a few minutes until finally my father took the floor and said.



\-That's probably the best joke I've heard in a long time.



\-But it's not a joke.



Our father seemed annoyed with that response and dismissed us with a gesture saying.



\-One joke isn't funny twice.



After that things got strange, it wasn't just our parents, no one seemed to believe my sister, her classmates called her a liar and the teachers thought she just wanted a better grade for free, even in the pharmacies no one would sell her anything for the pains she suffered because of the child because they didn't believe she was pregnant.



Not even when we brought them the positive test with the two little stripes did they deign to believe us, they simply told us that we were falsifying the test and that we were starting to be annoying and they didn't even try to test us.



But undoubtedly the worst part came with the growth of my sister's belly which should make the pregnancy evident but instead of believing it they thought that my sister had gotten fat on purpose so they hardly gave her food which made her almost die on several occasions but thanks to the little food that I gave her she managed to hold on until the day of the delivery.



Before this I have to tell you that you have never observed pain, you have not if you have not seen a young girl having to give birth without medical help, my damn sister had to give birth to a girl without any help only with me, a fourteen year old girl who had no idea what to do and I could only give her my hand so she would remember that she had me there.



And when the little girl she had created out of all her pain stuck her head out there, I burst out in happiness, at last we had a proof of what had happened, maybe we could go to the police and denounce the mistreatment suffered but then I saw it, rather I saw that my sister could not see the child, she was still asking me where the baby was.



Monica has gone crazy, she was sure she was pregnant and then she could not see the child she had in her uterus all this time but it is normal, the baby was aborted at the beginning of the year, and if you have to know something about ghosts is that they can only be seen by one person, for something nobody realized besides her that a girl was acting like her sister.
