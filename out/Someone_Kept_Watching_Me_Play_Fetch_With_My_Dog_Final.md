Hey Everyone! Sorry it took so long for the final update on what happened to me this summer. Things got a little busy going into the new month but I finally got some time to compose my thoughts and wrap up the last of this incident. 

Wiley is fine, by the way. He is sleeping next to my desk right now as I type everything up so no reason to worry. We're settle in a different part of the city now and things have calmed down a lot for us both in that regard. Anyways, here are the links to the first two parts of all of this, and I will tell yall what happened that night.

Wiley was gone.

My mind was racing, I was freaking out. Where could he be? Who would take him? Why break into my apartment just to steal my goodest boy?

I was scared, then sad, now I was angry. I knew where he was. Maybe these emotions were a holdover from the drinks from earlier, but there was only one place I could think of that he would be. In a way I got lucky that it all clicked for me there in my apartment, while I was in the state I was in. I was still scared, even shaking slightly. But he was my dog, and I had to go get him back.

I grabbed my flashlight and my wooden bat. If someone was stalking us I bet they were going to be somewhere near that building. I took my things and hurried out of the building. Once outside of the apartment complex, I ran across the field and saw the fire exit door propped open again. I knew it. I shook of the chills that had clung to my arms and took some deep breaths. I steadied my nerves and went inside.

I clicked the flashlight on. The exit sign above me glowed red, but otherwise I saw no other source of light. My own flashlight illuminated what looked to be a pretty standard government office building. To the left was a big breakroom. A long counter split up by a fridge, stove and sink ran along the wall close to me. Tables were spaced apart, and white tiling littered the floor. To my right was the main area. Glass doors led outside and a desk sat perpendicular to them. Further down I could see where another semi-hallway formed lining a bunch of offices. I checked to make sure the exit door was propped open enough and decided to start with the break room.

A slight echo sounded out with each step. It was very quiet with the blinds drawn over the long windows on the outside wall. Windows I’d passed by and looked through countless times with Wiley. No food was left out, and I could hear the thrum of the fridge as I got closer. I opened it up, it was empty. Not sure what I was expecting, I closed the fridge door as quietly as I could. The brightness of the fridge set spots in my eyes as I looked around, shining my flashlight. I felt a sudden unease. The hair was standing up on my arms and I turned the flashlight off. I listened for anything, holding my breath.

I looked to my right. Still holding my breath, I heard a raspy breath. Across the break room near the fire exit. My eyes were starting to adjust, and I saw movement. Low to the ground, something moved. I let out my breath and hurried the opposite direction. My ears felt like they were ringing and my heart beat a mile a minute. I saw a door open as I turned the corner and ducked inside.

It looked like a copy room. Office supplies lined a table near a standing printer while rest of the walls were filing cabinets. Quickly scanning the room I saw a small corner behind one of the cabinets and hid behind it.

I tried to keep my breathing slow but my heart was louder than anything else I heard. As I worked on controlling my breathing I heard more noises. Something was dragging itself across the floor. It dragged and then thudded against the ground as it moved near the wall I was crouched by. It repeated that movement. Pulling itself across the ground, with light raspy breathing that could barely be heard.

I jumped suddenly, the printer had turned on, and a blue light flashed across the room with each piece of paper working through the machine. I was sweating at this point watching the machine work, flashing its light each time. I saw movement near the door. I pulled myself back behind the cabinet, holding my flashlight ready in case I needed to use it. I held my breath again. The dragging had stopped, while the rasp breathing was barely concealed by the sounds of the printer. As it stopped, I heard movement near the door. The raspy breaths were still coming from the doorway, but they sounded higher up. Closer to the ceiling. I held my breath. 

The room grew silent. I was still holding my breath but could not hold it much longer. Just I was about to exhale, the room filled with baleful wails. Whatever it was cried out, and suddenly I heard loud crashing. With a startle, the printer was thrown into the set of drawers right next to me. Somehow I didn't jump, but shook slightly as it dented against the drawers.

I let out a breath and quickly held it again. This thing let out another wail, this time it sounded near the floor, but I then heard it dragging itself back out of the room.

I waited until here was silence, and let out my breath. I allowed myself to calm down, if but for a second. I looked around the side of the cabinet and saw the room empty. The printing machine was broken apart by the dented drawers next to me. I tried my best to steel my nerves and went out of the room.

I kept quiet, I had to find Wiley as quick as possible. If he was even here. But something in my gut told me he was. I checked the next two rooms of this short hallway, only flashing my light for a second just to check if he was there. No such luck.

I came to the end of the hallway and it opened into the main general area I'd seen when I first entered. From this side, two more glass double doors led outside in front of me. I could make out a couch with some chairs across from it on the opposite side of the room, while a long desk faced against the general area on the side of the wall nearest me. Streetlight shined softly through the glass doors illuminating this room more than the others. I went over o the desk and crouched down near it. I quickly checked behind the desk but Wiley wasn’t there. I hurriedly moved on.

As I moved across the room I heard the dragging, further down near the opposite doors on the other side of the room, that thing was dragging itself into the room. I quickly got behind the wall. The dragging stopped, I still heard movement, similar to someone picking themself up off the floor. Listening intently I heard whatever it was sniff the air. It sounded disgusting, as if it was loudly sniffing through a set of snotty nostrils. It sounded like it was coming near the ceiling again. I didn't dare to peak in case it saw me. 

I heard whatever this thing was lower itself back to the ground and drag itself across that side of the main area and back into the side hallways. I quickly crossed on my end and kept checking offices.

Cornering this side of the building were more offices that lined a hallway with the wall. I opened the door to a meeting room. I swept the room quickly with my flashlight, feeling my stomach sinking more and more knowing not many rooms were left, when I heard a soft whine. I hurried to the other side of the big table in the middle of the room and saw one of the chairs pulled out slightly. There was Wiley. He was curled up, head facing the table. He slightly kicked his feet and whined again. Funnily enough it looked like he was dreaming.

I gently reached out and woke him up. With some gentle pushes he quietly stirred. Wiley pulled his head up and looked at me and then let out a big yawn. I pet his head and rubbed his side trying to show how happy I was to see him okay. He slowly got up and approached me, he licked my face and wiggled his body at me.

I gave him more pets and slowly got up. I made shushing noises and gestured for him to follow me. Wiley looked back at his spot under the table and then back at me. Instead of lifting his head up at me to look, he would just swivel his eyes up. I frowned at him and continued towards the door while gesturing him to follow me. He gave a big stretch and then followed along.

Wiley sat next to the wall while I looked out the doorway. My eyes were adjusting to the dark, but mostly I just couldn’t see anything moving. Light was still shining from outside into the main lobby, but nothing stirred outside of the room. I looked back down at Wiley who just looked up again at me while panting. I patted my leg and stepped out into the hallway. I kept moving and headed up to the hallway corner. I looked back to make sure he was still following me and was happy to see him sticking right by my feet.

Peaking around the corner I still didn’t see anything. At this point I was ready to just get out of there so speed was key. I whispered “Come on buddy” To my boy and set off across the central office room. I checked the front door. I could see the outside parking lot through the glass panes but the door’s handle shook locked. We'd have to use the emergency door.

I looked back down at Wiley and he was staring across the room. I followed his stare and saw it. In the corner across the room, a black mass stretched from the floor almost to the ceiling, hidden in shadow. I couldn't make out anything to its form besides two massive eyes reflecting the dim streetlights that shined into the office. I heard heavy labored breaths from that corner.

“Wiley go!” I yelled and ran out of the central room. Wiley barked but I could hear him next to me running from whatever lay in wait in that room. The red of the emergency light gently glowed down this hallway, and I hit the door bar hard to throw it open. A flash of panic hit my chest as the door fought back, but with a heavy push it flung open and Wiley and I ran out into the lawn.

I kept running until we were past the trees and near the street. Light from the apartment complex bathed the surroundings and my heart was pounding in my ears. I was sucking air and looked around. Wiley was right by me panting heavily, and I looked up to see the emergency door was closed. No alarm had even sounded. I took a deep breath, but before I looked away, I could’ve sworn I saw those by reflective eyes in the slit of the window next to the exit. A car passed by the street and I turned my back to the building, leading Wiley home.

I haven’t wanted to put much thought into all of it. As I mentioned earlier I moved out, far away from that part of the city. I now have a nice backyard for Wiley to play in and haven’t walked him at night since. 

Curiously, almost a month ago while reading through local news articles I saw one that caught my eye. My old apartment complex was apparently suffering from a string of burglaries. And in one of the units, the tenant had said their dog had been taken, and never returned.
