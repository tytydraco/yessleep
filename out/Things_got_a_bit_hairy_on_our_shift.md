“I heard from a little birdie you get to train a new hire.”

I was restocking the cups as soon as I started my shift, Tommi, sat at the small table nearby with his sketch book out and three energy drinks and two of them drank already. Tommi run the local tattoo parlor down the street from the gas station I work at, he keeps his shop open well past midnight as he says drunk people rake in a lot of money. 

“I guess so. ‘Derick or Daren’ something like that,” I said barely looking over at him as I shoved more cups into the dispensers. 

“I heard he’s some transfer from the county over. Scott said he was a bit too uppity for his liking, like a squirrel who drank an expresso,” said Tommi, completely matter of fact. “Scott doesn’t like him.” 

Scott who works on the swing shift who’s a thirty something year old man doesn’t like people in general. But I get it, a very bubbly person isn’t made for this job, especially working the overnight shift after working for the last few weeks overnight, and the weird out of this world things that tend to happen to me wasn’t going to leave a good impression on the new guy. It might traumatize him, I mean David the previous overnight guy quit stopped showing up for a week after something happened to him. 

“Well, we’ll see how long he lasts,” I said as I opened the cupboard pulling out lids. 

Personally, I’ve never trained new employees even at my last job, and I know for a fact it’s not worth the energy to do. I’ve seen previous managers babysitting the new hires and seeing how frustrating it was, but that was back at my previous job, this one would be easier to train, although trying to teach them not to do certain things would be difficult. 

I liked to be a loner, although the weird noises and Sweeper, and the homelessness that comes through here, I didn’t really have to make conversation with people, well besides Tommi. Tommi was the kind of outgoing extravert that fills the quiet space with his talking, most of his spiels are entertaining. 

Tommi’s sketches were everywhere, showing off his talent as an artist and owner of his own tattoo parlor. Inspired, I considered my own dreams until the doorbell chimed. I turned from the cash wrap and called out, “HELLO?”
A man about my age walked through the door, I didn’t recognize him as a regular, he had a long, thin face and muddy brown hair, like a mop it was everywhere as if he didn’t know what a brush was. He wore a hoodie that ironically had Sammy from Wayside School printed on the front of it, I smiled after reading the previous comments on a post I made online about my experience about Sweeper. 

He held up one hand, “hi there, I’m looking for an Arlen.” He flicked his eyes between the two of us, knowing full well I was the one he was looking for, but the worried look on his face said he wasn’t exactly sure if I was the one he was actually looking for. His green eyes were filled with innocence that I nearly lied to him. 

I hesitated for a moment, uncertain about giving myself away to a stranger. The way he lingered in the doorway, almost afraid to step fully into the fluorescent light, made me even more cautious. Tommi glanced up from his sketchbook, eyebrows raised, sensing my uncertainty but saying nothing. There was a quiet tension in the air as I finally replied, “That’s me, Arlen. What brings you here?”

Like a dog he instantly perked up, and he smiled so wide I was afraid it might crack his whole face open. “Oh good! I’m Daren Huckabee, I’m the new hire or transfer however you want to put it, it’s great to meet you. I heard you needed someone to help you at the overnight shift, so I volunteered—”

I zoned out from listening to him drone on. His voice blended with the hum of the ceiling lights, and for a moment I was more focused on the rhythm of me putting lids into the small shelf next to the cup dispensers than the words pouring out of his mouth. Still, I caught bits and pieces—mentions of previous jobs, how he was “great with late hours,” and something about being able to handle weird situations. I wondered if he’d still be so upbeat after a week here, especially if he ran into Sweeper or any of the strange regulars who wandered in at 3 AM.

Finally, after he stopped talking, I reached over and shook his hand. “Nice to meet you Daren,” I said going back to stalking the lids. “You know how to clock in, right?” 

He ran his hand through his hair, “it’s the same system I assume.” 
I nodded and he walked towards the office in the back of the store, and I glanced over at Tommi who was now grinning. His long black hair fell down his shoulders in waves as he pulled a hair tie off his wrist and tied his hair back with a grin. “Looks like a good guy.” He snarked. 

I shrugged, not ready to form an opinion just yet. “We’ll see,” I muttered, grabbing a stack of receipt paper and pretending to be busy. The shop always had a way of revealing people’s true colors after a couple of graveyard shifts. Tommi just chuckled and bent back over his sketchbook, shading in the lines with the ease of someone who’s made peace with the night. 

He claims he just comes here to sketch and unwind, but I know better—he’s hiding out, letting the buzz of my store drown out whatever daytime noise he’s avoiding. Still, his presence is oddly comforting, like an anchor when the long hours threaten to blur together. Even on the slowest nights, having someone else share the quiet helps the time slip by a little faster.

Daren’s footsteps were loud, like sneakers squeaking on clean tiled floors, it was irritating, he had pulled his hoodie off and now as wearing our store’s uniform shirt. Which was a dark maroon color with our logo in black lettering on the right chest side. “I’m all clocked in, are you one of the regulars, here?” he glanced over at Tommi sketching. 

Tommi didn’t even look up from his sketchbook, a sly grin spreading across his face. “Oh, I’m just part of the furniture. They keep me around for ambiance,” he replied, his tone light but unmistakably teasing. “If you stay long enough, you might earn your spot on the shelf too.”

Daren laughed at him, and I rolled my eyes, glancing at the clock on the wall, I knew rush hour was going to start, or more like dinner rush. It was about that time when people were either heading home or going on their overnight shifts. The cars that zoomed past out by the highway were getting a little more traffic than usual. 

“I’m giving you a fair warning, Daren, working overnight here is a bit weirder than any other place you’ve probably worked.” I said as I walked around the counter with Daren on my heels. 

He smirked, a mix of curiosity and skepticism flickering across his face. “Weird, huh? Like, haunted soda machine weird, or just customers who talk to mannequins?” His attempt at humor was decent, but I could tell he was sizing up the place, noticing every odd detail as he followed me. 

I gestured toward the front windows, where the neon reflected off the glass in distorted shapes. “Let’s just say, you’ll see things here that don’t make sense anywhere else,” I replied, letting the mystery hang in the air between us. “Here, soon Sweeper will be in the parking lot don’t mind him, all he does is sweep.” And remembering that ‘he’ in general was just a bunch of rats in a trench coat. 

Daren furrowed his brow, clearly unsure if I was joking, but the gleam in his eye suggested he was up for whatever oddities the night might bring. The neon glow made his freshly donned uniform look almost burgundy, and the hum of the store grew a little louder as the first customers trickled in, bringing with them the unpredictable energy of the night shift.

Every gas station clerk has their weird regular, besides Tommi who likes to regularly hide out here. There is the one woman who was about to come in. she walks with a limp and had has a lazy eye, she always looks like she crawled out of a dumpster, but I learned quickly not to stare for far too long. Because that lazy eye of her moves on its own, it creeps me out. 

Gina walked through the door, “Hey there Gina,” I said as she limped passed us. “This is Daren, he’s going to be working with me for now on.” 

She grunted her usual greeting, barely glancing at Daren as she made her way toward the back coolers. There was a faint scent of cigarettes trailing behind her, mixing with the tang of cleaning solution and old coffee lingering in the air. Daren watched her for a moment, clearly intrigued but also doing his best not to stare, picking up quickly on the unspoken rules for dealing with the night’s cast of characters.

I leaned toward him, “That’s Gina, don’t stare at her lazy eye,” I whispered. 
Daren leaned back towards me, lowering his voice conspiratorially. “So, should I introduce myself to the lazy eye too, or would that be staring?” He flashed an awkward grin, clearly trying to lighten the mood despite the odd tension. I snorted, shaking my head, unable to help a small smile at his persistent attempts at humor.

“The lazy eye moves on its own, just trust me, don’t look at it,” I warned him. The jingle on the door rang out and I turned to see Peter walking through. “Pete, don’t make another mess at the icee machine again, my floors are supposed to be clean not sticky.” I scolded the old man. 

Peter shuffled in with his usual half-smile, one hand clutching a plastic grocery bag and the other already reaching for the Icee lever as if drawn by muscle memory. He wore his faded denim jacket tonight; the collar turned up against a chill that seemed more psychological than physical. 

Daren gave me a sidelong glance, silently confirming that Peter was another one of the regulars I’d warned him about. The old man just grunted, not even bothering to respond as he started the ritual of filling his cup—inevitably spilling a bright slush on the tile. It was all part of the nightly routine, one that Daren was quickly realizing came with its own strange rhythm.

As the night dragged on, it didn’t seem like the weird stuff wasn’t going to happen, even Sweeper in the distance was do his usual nightly ritual by the pumps. Tommi had long gone left after a couple of hours sketching and telling Daren not to die on his first shift. Daren went pale when he heard him joke about it, I’d told Daren there had been work related accidents on the job in the pass or so I had heard. After all I’m still a new employee too, but working the overnight shift has hardened me real quick. 

That is until about 3 a.m. came around, the weird started to act up. I was in the cooler putting the cold drinks on the shelf, I was bundled up in a hoodie when I heard the door jingle, and briefly heard Daren greet the customer. My hands were trembling from how cold it was in the cooler. I left Daren on his own, figuring if he knew how to do his job, surely, he wouldn’t be stupid enough to break the rules. I had shown the rules for overnight crew to follow, he read them and asked if I was joking. 

I told him I wish I was joking, but I wasn’t. The stories from the overnight shift weren’t just weird, they were the kind you couldn’t make up, and even I hadn’t gotten used to them yet. Daren’s eyes widened as he realized I was dead serious, and for a moment, the chill from the cooler felt even sharper.
There was a knocking coming from the freezer door and a small voice calling out for help, I learned quickly to ignore the pleas of the ghost who wanted out of the freezer. When it first happened to me, I almost never went near the cooler ever again. But know I tune it out, as the knocks became rhythmic. “Shut it, I’m trying to work,” I hissed at the knocking. 

Sometimes, I swear the knocks almost line up with the ticking of the clock, as if the ghost is keeping time with us out here. It’s become just another sound in the background—like the hum of the cooler fans or the distant thuds of Sweeper’s broom against the pavement. Daren hasn’t experienced it yet, but I know it’s only a matter of time before he hears it himself and asks me about the freezer door.

That is until I heard screaming from out on the floor, it sounded like Daren. I dropped the last can onto the shelf and rushed out of the cooler, my heart pounding in my chest. The store lights flickered overhead as I hurried toward the front, half-expecting to see Daren tangled up in some mess or maybe facing one of the regulars in a panic. 

But as I rounded the corner, what I saw made me stop dead in my tracks—a shadow stretched long across the sticky tile, darker than anything I'd ever seen inside these walls. Daren stood frozen, mouth open, eyes wide in terror, while the shadow inched closer, somehow twisting and shifting against the bright fluorescent glare.

The shadow moved with no human body around; Daren was on the counter as if he was witnessing a rat running around the store. I held my hand to my chest, “you scared the shit out of me, damn it, Daren!”

He pointed at the moving shadow that shot across the store through the aisles, packages of candy fluttering as if it did so. “The—the— hell is that?!”
“it’s a shadow, what do you think it is,” I pushed my hair back from my forehead.

Daren shook his head, trying to process what he’d just seen. “No, man, that thing wasn’t normal. Shadows don’t just move like that,” he stammered, voice barely above a whisper. I glanced back at the aisle, watching the last pieces of candy settle, and couldn’t help but feel a chill creep up my spine. There were plenty of explanations for strange happenings on the overnight shift, but some things just never got any easier to explain.

“It isn’t going to hurt you unless you hurt it first,” I sighed. It was true, a shadow likes coming in here and going to the candy aisle how a shadow could eat candy was beyond me. but it comes in once in a while, although I can’t fault Daren for acting the way he did, when it first happened to me, I ignored it and told myself its not real. 

Looking back now, I wish someone had warned me just how weird things could get on the graveyard shift. You think you’ve seen it all until the unexplainable start creeping into your routine, turning a simple stocking job into a test of nerves. Daren’s reaction was a reminder that, no matter how often I told myself these things were normal, deep down, they still unsettled me just as much. The night wasn’t done with us yet, and I had a feeling it would get stranger before sunrise.

That is until we heard a banging noise in the backroom, Daren stared at me like a deer in headlights. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” he whispered, his voice trembling. I could tell he was hoping I’d say it was just the pipes or maybe someone dropping a box, but I didn’t have any easy answers. The sound was too deliberate, too heavy, almost like something wanted to announce its presence. We exchanged a look, silently daring each other to go check it out, but neither of us moved at first, waiting for the noise to come again.

Then, suddenly, I heard a weird skittering noise that made me freeze. I glanced over, expecting a mouse or maybe a stray piece of plastic, but instead, I saw a mustache—just a mustache—walking on its own across the floor. It wiggled purposefully, its ends twitching like little insect legs as it made its way under a shelf and disappeared into the shadows. For a moment, neither of us knew what to say, just staring at the spot where it vanished, each silently questioning our grip on reality.

“Well, that’s new,” I said. 

Daren shook his head, “did we just see a—”

Before Daren could finish, the mustache reappeared, crawling out from beneath the shelf with even more urgency. Its bristly ends quivered as it scuttled across the linoleum, heading straight for us. I instinctively took a step back while Daren froze, eyes wide as the mustache darted closer, almost as if it had chosen its next target.

I reached for a broom Daren had conveniently left by the counter, as it leapt in the air after me, I grabbed the handle of the broom and used it like a baseball bat and smacked the mustache across the store. It smacked right into a shelf filled with peanuts, scattering the packages across the floor. The Mustache looked dazed as it wobbled, the ends of it trembling. 

For a second, I thought that was the end of it. But the mustache shook itself, regaining its composure with a strange, determined energy. Daren let out a nervous laugh—high-pitched and shaky—while I kept the broom raised, not sure if I was more afraid or amused. The whole situation felt unreal. We exchanged a look that told me he was just as lost as I was, but neither of us was willing to let our guard down just yet.

Just then a man walked inside the store, he looked at me strangely wielding a broom and Daren who was still clearly on the counter like a frightened little girl. “Is there a rat in the store or something—”

The mustache, apparently emboldened by its previous antics, suddenly flung itself at me. I ducked just in time, feeling the rush of air as it sailed passed my face—and before anyone could react, it smacked right into the customer’s face. The man stumbled back, his eyes wide in shock as the mustache latched on, wriggling furiously across his upper lip while he sputtered in disbelief.

The whole scene felt frozen for a moment, like we were watching some twisted magic trick. The man clawed at his face, trying to pry the mustache off, but it clung tight, its wiry hairs writhing as if determined to stay put. Daren scrambled down from the counter, finally finding his voice. “Sir, you might want to—uh—hold still!” he stammered, powerless to explain as the mustache seemed to settle, curling perfectly into place as if it belonged there all along.

We all just stared, speechless. The man blinked several times, then slowly ran his finger over the new facial addition, as if testing whether it was actually real. Daren and I exchanged glances, unsure if we should try to intervene or if this was simply beyond our pay grade. The mustache seemed to have calmed down, perfectly content with its new host, while the man looked more confused than alarmed, searching our faces for any hint of explanation.

But it was no longer the man in control; you could see his mouth twitching and lips moving as if he were trying to speak, yet every expression was dictated by the mustache’s odd, animating force. For a moment, his eyes flashed with panic, but then his features settled into a strange, mustachioed calm, as if the mustache had claimed him as its own.

The awkward silence hung in the air, broken only by the faint hum of the store’s refrigerator. I tightened my grip on the broom, not entirely sure what the protocol was for sentient facial hair emergencies. Finally, the man—now sporting the rogue mustache—gave a hesitant, almost involuntary smile. 

It looked like the mustache was puppeteering his expressions, twisting the corners of his mouth into shapes none of us had ever seen. Daren leaned closer, whispering, “Is it... safe now?” I shrugged, unable to answer, as we watched our newest customer morph into something equally comical and unsettling right before our eyes.

The man began to speak, but the words that came out didn’t sound like his own. His voice took on a peculiar cadence—half whisper, half theatrical flourish—almost as if the mustache was trying out language for the first time. “Greetings, humble mortals,” he intoned, his lips moving stiffly in time with the mustache’s subtle twitches. Daren and I exchanged alarmed glances, realizing that whatever was speaking through him was definitely not the man we’d seen walk in just moments before.

I stayed quiet, gripping the broom a little tighter, unsure if any response would only encourage whatever bizarre force had taken hold. Daren, on the other hand, cleared his throat and forced a shaky smile, as if determined to maintain some semblance of customer service. “Uh, welcome to the store!” he said, his voice wavering just a bit too high. “Can I, um, help you find anything today?” The mustached man’s lips curled into a dramatic grin, and for a heartbeat, I wondered if Daren’s attempt at normalcy would make things better—or much, much weirder.

The mustached man’s grin widened, the hairs twitching with mischievous intent. He leaned in ever so slightly, and in that same odd, theatrical cadence, intoned, “Your soul.” The words hung heavily between us, absurd and chilling at once, making Daren take an involuntary step back. For a split second, I thought he might be joking—but the way the mustache seemed to bristle made me wonder if it was only half in jest, and entirely in control.

If either of us made a move I knew something was going to happen. I remembered rule number eight: never touch anything that moves on its own. My heart thudded in my chest as I tried to recall the rest of the emergency manual—though, admittedly, it had never covered haunted mustaches before. Daren looked just as tense, his eyes darting from me to the mustached man, both of us frozen by the absurdity—and danger—of the moment.

The man’s eyes narrowed on us, and the dazzling theatrical smile it had been displaying on the man’s face, turned into a scowl. “Mortals are not as fun these days are they.” His tone took on a more sinister edge now, the mustache curling into shapes that seemed almost threatening. The fluorescent lights flickered overhead, casting strange shadows across his face. Daren gripped a nearby display of candy bars, as if they might offer some sort of protection. I steadied myself, determined not to let fear show, even as the mustache’s sinister energy filled the tiny store.

A tense silence settled over us as the mustache seemed to almost vibrate with anticipation. I glanced at the door, wondering if an escape would trigger another attack, but the mustached man blocked the way with an unsettling, deliberate step. The air felt thick, charged with the possibility that anything could happen next. I swallowed hard and tried to steady my nerves, silently hoping that the bizarre entity would tire of its performance and give us a chance to restore some kind of normalcy—if that was even possible anymore.

“I don’t know what you are,” I said firmly. “But you are not welcomed in this store.” 

The mustache twitched as if considering my words, then contorted itself into an exaggerated frown. For a brief moment, the man's body stiffened, as though fighting for control. The atmosphere felt electric—charged both with fear and a strange, hypnotic curiosity. Daren edged a little closer to me, his hand still hovering protectively near the candy bars, while I kept my gaze locked on the mustached man, refusing to back down.

“That’s a shame,” he said as the man’s head tilted. 

For a heartbeat, the mustache drooped, quivering as if stung by rejection. The man’s fingers flexed at his sides, caught in the silent struggle between his own will and the mustache’s eerie dominance. A strange, shimmering chill seemed to ripple through the store, making the rows of cans and snacks tremble imperceptibly. In that pregnant pause, I wondered if my defiance would provoke the entity—or finally convince it to leave us be.

My job was cut and clean to make sure the store runs without any issues, keep the store clean and efficient, there was nothing that was said I had to help customers who ended up in this predicament. But in my peripheral vision I could see Daren wanting to help the man, and seeing him grabbing candy bars, I wasn’t sure how that was going to help the situation at all. 

Yet even as I tried to stick to the job description, the sense of responsibility tugged at me—maybe not for the mustached man, but for Daren, who was clearly out of his depth. I took a steady breath and tried to think fast, scanning the shelves for anything that could serve as a distraction or deterrent. The store felt smaller than ever, squeezed by the supernatural tension, but I knew we had to do something before the mustache made its next move.

Just as I predicted, Daren hurled the fistful of candy bars straight at the mustache controlling the man. The wrappers spun through the air, scattering across the linoleum with a chaotic clatter. For a moment, the mustache recoiled, its bristling form rippling in apparent surprise, and the man staggered back as if the sugary projectiles had broken the entity’s concentration. The absurdity of the assault hung in the air, but the distraction was just enough to break the tension—and Daren in all his stupidity, leapt at the man. 

Panic shot through me as Daren collided with the man, both of them tumbling awkwardly into a rack of potato chips. I dropped the broom and rushed forward, unsure whether to pull Daren away or help pin down the mustached man. The mustache writhed furiously, its ends flaring outward like the legs of some monstrous insect, and for a split second, I thought I saw sparks flicker in its twisted curls.

Summoning every ounce of courage, I grabbed the nearest item—a bottle of soda—and prepared to jump in. The stakes were suddenly real, the line between the absurd and the terrifying blurring with every frantic heartbeat. All that mattered now was stopping the mustache before it regained control—or before Daren got himself seriously hurt.

Without thinking, I lunged forward, the bottle of soda held high like a shield. The mustache lashed toward me, its wiry hairs whistling inches from my face, but I swung the bottle in a wide arc, splashing fizzy liquid across the man's chest and the pulsating mass above his lip. The mustache shrieked—not with sound, but with a visceral, vibrating energy that rattled the shelves and sent shivers through my bones. I could only hope the chaos would be enough to loosen its grip, if only for a moment.

That shot of energy threw Daren across the store, slamming his head on the table and he passed out, a huge cut on his forehead, and blood started to trickle down his face. My heart hammered in my chest, torn between rushing to Daren’s side and keeping my guard up against the writhing mustache. The mustached man crumpled to his knees, hands clutching his head as the entity spasmed, struggling to regain coherence. I took that distraction and ran to Daren’s side.  

The pulsation of the energy shot through the store again, the man tried to rip the mustache off his face, as its tendrils kept latched but I noticed the soda I had used was making it hard for the mustache to stay on the mans face. I blinked, as a realization came to my mind. Soda? 

Maybe it wasn’t just the force of my swing, but something in the soda itself—a hidden ingredient that made the mustache recoil more violently than before. I mean soda is used to clean toilets for God sake. I glanced at the label, half-expecting to find some clue, but all I could see was the usual list: sugar, caffeine, carbonated water. 

Still, the fizz seemed to eat away at the supernatural threads clinging to the man’s skin. My mind raced, searching for other quick solutions—Could I douse the mustache again before it regrouped?

I looked at the display of bottled glass soda like the one I used; it took me hours to make that display. I groaned in irritation. This was way above my pay grade. But still. “Daren you still with me?” I asked gently. 

Daren groaned from the pain. Seeing he was fine, I ran to the glass bottled soda display, my footsteps echoing in the suddenly tense silence. With shaking hands, I grabbed as many bottles as I could, determined to use whatever edge I had against the mustache's relentless grip. 

I ran toward the man, my arms full of glass soda bottles, adrenaline fueling each desperate step. Fumbling with the caps, I managed to pop one open and splashed its contents directly onto his face, the sticky, fizzing liquid drenching both the man and the writhing mustache. He clawed at his upper lip, fingers trembling as the mustache sizzled and recoiled from the fresh wave of soda. 

For a heartbeat, the mustache seemed to shrink, its wiry tendrils curling inward as if retreating from the onslaught of fizz. The air filled with the sharp scent of soda, mingling with the metallic tang of adrenaline and blood. The man gasped, his eyes wild, as the mustache loosened its grip, leaving angry red marks across his skin. Who knew that the soda filled with chemical poison, we like to drink is taking out a supernatural mustache. 

Desperate for anything that might help, I grabbed the tip jar off the counter by the register, its weight reassuring in my trembling hands. I unscrewed the lid and dumped the dollars and coins on the counter and slammed it over the mustache and sealed it into the jar. 

For a moment, everything seemed to freeze—the mustache pressed against the glass, writhing and thrashing in a frenzy, unable to escape. The jar vibrated in my hands as if the thing inside was testing the limits, but it held firm. I twisted the lid tighter, praying that would be enough to keep the entity contained until we figured out what to do next. My breath came in ragged gasps, relief and disbelief mingling as the immediate danger was finally contained.

I ended up calling for an ambulance, my hands still trembling as I pressed the buttons, barely able to string together a coherent sentence. Of course, the cops showed up soon after, their sirens slicing through the night air. I had to think fast, cobbling together a realistic story about a shelf collapsing and Daren getting caught in chaos and the customer who was now traumatized couldn’t string sentences coherently, I lied about him witnessing the whole thing. I left out the part about the sentient mustache and the supernatural struggle—after all, who would believe that?

As paramedics tended to Daren, I kept my answers simple, focusing on the confusion and panic, glossing over any details that might invite suspicion. The officers eyed the broken bottles, the sticky floor, and not seeing the glass jar with the mustache now tucked safely behind the counter but seemed satisfied with my explanation. 

I replayed the encounter over and over in my head, wondering how long my story would hold up—and what on earth I was supposed to do with the thing trapped in that jar behind the counter. 

Of course I had to clean the mess up, Daren and the customer were taken to the hospital, and for Daren’s first shift here, honestly, it wasn’t as bad as I thought it could’ve been. Sure, there was broken glass and drank soda everywhere, but at least everyone was alive, and the mustache was contained. As I mopped up the sticky soda and swept away the shards, I couldn’t help but laugh a little at the absurdity of it all—just another night at the store, right?

Until one of the glass bottles fell from the display and I nearly jumped out of my own skin, echoing off the polished linoleum. My nerves were shot, and for a split second, I thought the mustache had somehow escaped. Heart pounding, I checked the jar—still sealed, the twisted thing pressed against the glass. I let out a shaky breath, forcing myself to relax, even as my eyes darted anxiously around the store. The quiet seemed loaded now, every small sound magnified by my lingering fear and disbelief.
