Nine. That’s how many times I’ve been down [previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ek4kgj/theres_a_trapdoor_no_one_knows_whats_below_it/). Over and over down those steps into the pitch dark. Each time, I come out with no memory, heart sledgehammering my ribs like I’m about to go into cardiac arrest.

Ten days ago, 14-year-old Sophie and her sister, 17-year-old Chloe, were urban exploring when something terrified them both. The footage they recorded shows only static—cameras and phones do not work below. Sophie fled, leaving Chloe stuck when the trapdoor mistakenly closed behind her. The cops could find no trace of the trapdoor later—no, because it is warded, invisible to the naked eye when shut.

It was Sophie’s online plea for help that drew me here, to this abandoned house in Milwaukee to help her find her sister. Not that I’m any kind of hero—nope, I’m a former-con-artist-turned-paranormal-investigator with a spine like wet tissue. Following foul odors, scuttling around in the dark, and running at the first whiff of danger are all part of my skillset as a clever coward.

(Also the skillset of a cockroach.)

Whatever. Point is, I was made to go scuttling in creepy corners!

But Sophie wasn’t.

I lost her when she followed me down on one of my trips. Now she’s down there and I’m up here, with my useless cameras and lights and equipment, staring down into that dingy basement as if I could see through the blackness and identify whatever lies beyond, all the hairs on my neck standing on end as I wonder… how can I possibly save her from the horror that lurks below… how, when I can’t even remember it? 

**FIRST ATTEMPT**

I scrabble in my bag and snatch up a handful of salt, a jackknife, a crowbar. “SOPHIE!!” If panic hadn’t sent my wits packing, I might remember what I told Sophie about heroism—that it’s a quick ticket to doom, that you should *never* confront the paranormal head-on.

And if I had a single firing synapse in my brain, I certainly wouldn’t *announce* myself to whatever scary thing lurks below, like I do when I holler, “I’M COMING!” And then, like every heroic idiot who dies first in every horror movie—all aboard the bravery train! Next stop, death!—I plunge down those stairs—

—only to careen out like a chicken with its tailfeathers on fire, jacket sleeve torn open. No knife. No crowbar. No salt.

**SECOND ATTEMPT**

The odor of death clogs my nostrils as I put on night vision goggles, opting for stealth this time. I scrawl the questions that need answers: *1) What happened to Sophie? 2) Why can’t she leave? 3) What is sealed below?* My heart’s drumming hard enough to start its own band as I creep down into the basement of this derelict house, the wooden steps softly creaking under the rush of the blood in my ears. My pockets stuffed with pens. A marker. A notepad. Bear mace as a last resort. The dark swallows me whole—

—and spits me out, my heart playing my ribs like a xylophone, my throat raw from shrieking. I scrabble through my pockets but my paper is gone. Pens gone. Marker gone. No questions answered. No writing.

Not one single word.

**THIRD ATTEMPT**

I craft an email with the house’s address and a single line of instruction: *close the trapdoor and leave the house*. Then I crouch on the top step and cup a hand to my mouth and shout: “This trapdoor sure has been sealed a loooong time! If it closes it’ll be sealed… oh, maybe decades more. And if I’m not back in an hour, the message I’ve scheduled will go out and the door will be sealed. But with your help, and mine, we can find a better option where you don’t kill my friend and I don’t lock you in for another few decades… wanna talk?”

The hairs along my arms prickle. Something is near… just out of range of the cameras aimed at the rectangle of darkness below. Whatever it is makes my skin crawl and my stomach churn and suddenly the air smells very stale, very old. Those wards around the trapdoor are a warning, and they likely mean that going down there, getting chummy with this rank and reeking thing, is unwise. But all my previous tactics have failed. And if you’re wondering, Hey Jack, is it really a good idea to deliver your meat suit to the thing below like a tasty meals-on-wheels? Listen, I *am* a snack, but I’m also fast food.

(It’ll have to catch me.)

But just in case I come up empty-handed again, I concoct a cheat code so my empty hands will mean something: *Fists for lion, palms for jackal.*

\*\*\*

I emerge out of the dark wreathed in the odor of death and bearing two items: Sophie’s phone, dropped when she first explored with her sister Chloe ten days ago, and a sheaf of yellowed papers.

I also come out of there with black sharpie scrawled on my left forearm, and my hands open, palms facing out.

\*\*\*

I should probably explain my little cheat. Some men are lions. Me, I’m a jackal—shifty and sly with an aversion to danger. This is a fantastic quality in a solo act. Less endearing when you’ve got someone to protect, especially a girl. It’s not good form, to throw the girl at danger instead of yourself. Girls hate that. (Just ask my ex!)

Coming up with hands balled into fists would mean brawn over brain. In real-world terms: call the cops, invite them to rush down guns blazing and then summon whatever special operatives typically deal with UAPs and other classified phenomena. Let *them* rescue Sophie.

But I came up with palms. I double check the cameras to be sure, and even through the distortion, the Jack onscreen looks like a scruffy junkie under arrest with his hands held up. As he passes the threshold, his bloodshot eyes fix on the camera—meeting mine—and he winks. I rewind the frame because at first I think I imagined it. Nope. In the fraction of a second before the warding makes him forget, he squeezes one eye shut, letting me in on the fact he’s playing a trick. Problem is, *I* don’t know what game THAT guy’s playing. The only clues I have are Sophie’s dead phone, the yellowed pages, and the sharpie message on my arm.

A message composed of only seven words:

*Victim Alive. Must Perform* *~~Incantation~~* *Ritual. Escape.*

\*\*\*

And now I’m sitting here wreathed in the stench of death, staring at my three measly clues: the phone, the pages, the ink. The phone is cracked and dead. I plug it in to give it some juice and turn my attention to the pages.

The writing on the brittle paper is faded… arcane symbols surrounded by capitalized letters and some geometric squiggles and dots. Google Translate says it’s Latin and… Aramaic? Is that a language? I am so out of my depth… Obviously the pages are related to the warding on the trapdoor, but it’s all ~~Greek~~ Aramaic to me. I’m like a chimp with a tablet. Sure, I can bash my monkey paws on the glowing icons, but I’ll probably crash the system long before I figure out how it works. I clutch the heart locket around my neck.

*She* would be able to make sense of this. She was always so much smarter with research than me. With all this esoteric stuff. “*With most stuff,”* she’d probably say. (Which isn’t strictly speaking true. I know way more short people jokes, for example. I tried explaining a few to my 5’0” ex, but they went over her head… and I slept on the couch ever after). And suddenly my heart aches… there’s nothing more pitiful than a clown telling jokes when he’s lost his audience.

It's been three months since our breakup. I swore I’d never contact her. But I’ll never decipher these pages myself.

I fire off a single message: *Hey Babe, it’s Jack. Can I ask a favor…?*

\*\*\*

I unlock Sophie’s old phone using the same pattern she used on her replacement phone this morning (What? I collect pins and passwords like other people collect coins…).

In the gallery are photos of Sophie and an older teen who I assume is Chloe in happier days. I click one of the videos and they’re eating ramen and rating the noodles by mouthfeel, spiciness, etc. It’s ridiculous and cute. The older teen is dressed in boyish clothes but has feminine mannerisms, hiding her mouth with her hand as she slurps a noodle. It flicks broth into her eye. Sophie looks just as she did this morning with her strawberry blonde hair and wide sea-green eyes, but instead of shaking and scared like a baby bird, she’s laughing at Chloe. Both siblings share the same dimpled smiles.

I memorize Chloe’s features so I’ll recognize her. There’s an ancient reek wafting up those stairs, but also a fresher odor of putrefaction. Ten days below with no food or water… God, it’s so sad…

I flick to videos of the trapdoor, but it’s all just darkness and static, so I turn my attention to the sharpie on my arm:

*Victim Alive. Must Perform* *~~Incantation~~* *Ritual. Escape.*

I search my pockets. No marker, which means someone gave me a marker to write this message—then took the marker away. Sus.

If I just look at the first le—

The blaring of my phone’s ringtone shatters the silence of the abandoned house like sirens, and I jump, heart lurching into my throat. When I snatch up my phone to see who the call is from, my pulse ratchets up, faster and faster like a hummingbird’s wings.

It’s the girl in my locket.

\*\*\*

FML—she’s *video* calling. I scurry outside into the midday sun—can’t risk whatever lurks below overhearing me—and as I wade out into the tall grass and summer heat, I shoot a quick glance at my reflection in one of the cracked windows. Wince because I look like I just found the source of the decomposing odor in the basement—and it’s me. Like if you gave an AI image-generator the prompt: “Florida man lives in swamp in cardboard box with gator.” Like I’m the posterchild for the catchphrase, “Who needs a shower when you sweat this much?” Like—oh fuck me, there are more important things than my vanity. I take the call.

—instant regret, because suddenly there she is, and oh, she’s even more beautiful than I remember, so much so it makes my heart hurt. She looks like she stepped off the cover of a k-pop album, glossy black hair cascading around her shoulders, her cheeks just slightly flushed as she exclaims, “Jack? Oh my God, it’s you! Are you okay? What’s going on? Where are you?”

For a moment I can’t answer, my breath taken away as her face goes through a whole range of emotions. Emma’s eyes study me, and I can’t tell if she’s concerned or disappointed as she takes in my stubbly beard and sunken cheeks and battered, stained tank—I look like I just woke up from my nap in the box I call home with the gator I call Fred. I want to say so much. I miss you. I love you. I’m sorry. But I say none of the things, instead blurting, “A teen girl’s life is in danger, and I can’t save her without you…”

\*\*\*

Maybe the phrase “fucking asshole” comes up a few times. Something about how the only time I reach out is when I’m “caught in some paranormal bullshit,” not because I actually love her. I *do* love her. It’s *because* I love her that I’ve never contacted her, not once of the tens, hundreds, thousands of times I’ve reached for the phone.

I never reached out because I promised myself I’d keep her *safe.*

And now I’ve broken my promise, like I break all promises.

Like I [broke us.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1czp6lp/i_met_this_guy_im_really_into_but_i_think_he/)

I’ve sent her scans of all the pages and photos of the dusty floorboards and the markings of the symbols around the trapdoor. And even though I know it’s wrong to drag her in and I dread the risks, I’m so, so, so excited to see her.

**FINAL ATTEMPT**

There’s just one more thing I have to do. Because even after deciphering the sharpie message, I don’t know enough. And so before my girl gets here, before I put Sophie and Emma and everyone I care about at risk, one last time, I descend into the pitch dark with its reek of decay.

…. When I come back up, a blade bites into my skin. A knife. My own. I gasp when I realize it is my hand holding the knife, and I jerk the blade away. *What… the actual… fuck?* I check the camera footage. I’ve been below for twenty-seven minutes, and all of that time shows nothing but the pitch dark of the stairs… until the last few seconds when I emerge, one hand up in the air, palm open, the other pressing the blade into my skin hard enough to draw blood.

Through the camera’s distortion I can make out the garbled sound, my lips repeating the same phrase, over and over: “Ddduuunnoottttoooobaakoowwn… Ddduoottttoooobaakoown…”

*Do not go back down.*

I touch the thin line of blood, and then find one more clue tucked in my pocket. A piece of paper with my own spidery scribble:

*Do not* ***g****o* ***d****own!!! If you want to* ***m****ake* ***s****ure* ***S****ophie* ***i****s* ***s****afe, break the wards that are* ***s****et around the* ***t****rap door. Stay* ***u****pstairs!!!* ***U****se the notes to dispel the wards. Do not come down again, because your* ***l****ight draws it* ***t****o her!! Sophie is hiding* ***b****lind in the dark from the thing that took her sister.* ***I****t was summoned here by the wards, which keep it in this world, but if you* ***b****reak* ***t****he* ***w****ards* ***t****hen that will* ***k****ill* ***i****t (dispel it) and set Sophie free.*

***W****hen* ***i****t is gone Sophie will be able to* ***c****ome* ***u****pstairs* [*safely.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
