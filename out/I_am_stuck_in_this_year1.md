The thing is I am really happy with my life to be honest-there is absolutely nothing that I hate my looks, my passion in guitar , my decent studies. There hasn't been a single thought in my head about hating my self and i am quite proud of that because most of the kids that are around me are so miserable and they hate their self for the tiniest of the reason.

 I don't understand that at all . Even my friend brad hated him self even though from outside perspective he had to be far happier than i was but still he hated himself for the things that didn't really matter. We were like brothers even though we were completely opposite of each other there was not a single moment were weren't with each other. To be honest there was not a single thing i hated about brad. His humor, his responsible side and how helpful he was. But-he committed suicide about half a year ago.

 I was devastated and i think that was the first time i hated my self for not noticing the signs, i still regret not asking him about his problems and not being there for hi when he needed me the most.

Time passed the wounds started to clear up but the slight pain was always there in my daily life. His death impacted me and changed me as a person having no one to laugh with , chat with , play with . I became a loner and i was scared of making friends as i always feared that again i might have to experience that pain of losing someone so close. I gradually became a neet and stayed at home but i didn't necessarily hated my self , yes i had that hate but the original me started to come out again.

 I stayed home for countless months accepting that pain. But every once in a while i though maybe i should have died instead of him because he had so many things going on in his life. He had placed second in inter high volleyball competition and dreamed of becoming a pro. Thinking about his achievements reflected my own self and my under achievements .

 I thought instead of him why not me , it didn't really matter if i died or if i stayed alive but he had potential in him to be someone. The only thing i hoped all day was to apologize to him , a genuine one. After a few months i came out of my home and had to again study 2nd year of high school as i had missed too many days to get promoted. I continued my loner days but i was to be honest scared to make friends so i didn't. But due to the trauma , i wanted to become a doctor i wanted to help save people i really did. I wanted people live their lives . I- didn't want peoples life to get taken from them.

SO i studied hard I studied so hard that my eyes would burst .I wanted to apply for the college of my dreams it was spring of my final year of high school. Like always studying in the roof top of he school while eating my lunch. In the corner of my eye i noticed  a girl trying to commit suicide by jumping. My body moved before i could think. I pushed her out but i fell saving her. It happened so quick that it felt like milliseconds. I died thinking at least i was able to save someone and do something doctor like.

But then i woke up in that exact rooftop i was sure that i had died i had a book in my hand as always and had the same lunch that i was eating . I was so sure that i had died and knew that i had died. I began forming thoughts and realized that that girl might again come here to kill her self but now i could prevent it i stayed there waited for her. But- she didn't come. I waited and waited skipped 3 classes because the fear of someone dying was ingrained in my brain. 

After that i thought to look for her in the school I found her she seemed totally normal she was laughing , smiling had a lot of friends but even though she was well and happy that moment was running in my brain every day thinking that was it a dream or reality. I moved on quickly from that and i thought that maybe it was just a hallucination after so much studying. Finally i was able to graduate from high school and my dream of becoming a doctor didn't seem that farfetched either. I gave the entrance for the college that i wanted to study. I passed - maybe that might be the happiest moment of my life.

 But the first day when i was going to my college i got into a major train accident and DIED or so i thought but i again woke up in the roof top of my high school did i just imagine it? No It did happen i couldn't mistake it at all i looked at the time and saw that it was still my 2nd year.
