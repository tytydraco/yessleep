Growing up My dad was always very secretive about his past. From what little he’s told to me through the years I’ve gathered that he grew up rather hard. He had an alcoholic/drug addict father, grew up in some shitty run down Baltimore projects, hung out with tons of gang members and drug dealers and plenty of other low life’s. All things that he never likes to talk about and I don’t blame him. My life wasn’t exactly peach’s and cream either. My mom up and left a few years ago when I was 16 just about a year after my older brother died from an overdose and around the same time my other brother went to jail for selling heroin. I guess she just didn’t want to deal with this fucked up family anymore. So now it’s just me and my dad in our duplex.

Anyways last night my dad was sitting on the couch taking shots from a bottle of Jack Daniel’s Honey. He doesn’t usually drink but when he does he drinks Jack honey and he’ll drink hard. I was coming back from hanging out with some friends around midnight stoned as fuck tip toeing through the kitchen and trying to sneak by my dad passed out in front of the TV in his recliner clutching his bottle. I tried to make it upstairs to my room as carefully as I could but our creaky stairs woke up my dad.

“SETH!! Seth come over here. I want to talk.” He says slurring his words looking at me half way up the stairs and slumps his head back down 

I try walking up more steps so I can just get to bed but as I keep walking up he picks his head up again. 

“SETH!! I SAID COME DOWN HERE I NEED TO TALK TO YOU!” He made sure to keep his head up this time and stared at me as best he could with a solemn look. 

I walked down the stairs and sat on the couch across from him. 

“What? What do you want dad?” I say kind of annoyed. I don’t really talk with him much and we don’t have a very good relationship believe it or not. 

“Son. *hckk* I need to tell you something *hckk*” he looks me in the eyes leaned over in his chair and takes a swing from his bottle.

“What is it dad I’m trying to go to bed I got shit to do in the morning.” 

“I need to tell you a story Sethy. It’s *hckk* it’s very important.” He says slurring his words barley even comprehensible 

“Dad just tell me in the morning. I’m going to bed.” I said getting up and starting to walk away

“I SAID SIT!!” He screamed and through his glass on the floor stumbling up still clutching his bottle of jack and looking at intensely.

I sat back down and crossed my arms annoyed, angry, and a little scared at his sudden outburst.

“Go ahead old man. What.” I say 

He sits back down and takes another shot out of his bottle. I’m honestly surprised at the size and frequency he’s downing these shots. This is definitely the drunkest I’ve ever seen him before. 

“Jackie I-I mean Seth. I need to *hckk* start by saying I-I love you. Ok?” He leans over in his chair to get a closer look at me across from him. 

“Yeah dad I love you too.” Something I haven’t said in years to him.

“That’s good that’s good son.”  He says he leans back and reclines

“Listen Seth I know we don’t really talk and that hurts me. It really does son an- and I need to get this off of my chest alright.” He grabs a cigarette out of his pack and lights it taking a large drag off of it.

“You never want to talk you never talk about anything at all. I mean I’m your son and I don’t even really know the first thing about you.” I say 

“I-I know I don’t talk about my past son. It-it’s just something that I don’t like to relive. I mean all the shit I did back then. Those people I killed it’s just not-“

“Wait what?” I interrupt him confused 

“People you killed? The fuck are you talking about?” I stare at him 

“He looked at me blankly like he wasn’t sure what I was talking about I don’t think he even knew what he said. he took another long drag off his cigarette and continued talking 

“Ya- yeah. That’s a long story ja-Seth. I- it was something crazy. To be quick yeah I did.” He threw his arms up in a “so what” kind of way

“Your uncle Dave and me went to go rob some local dealers for a few bricks we knew they just re uped on and shit went south. It was either me or them and I chose me.” He smiled and started chuckling and shaking his head.

“What the fuck dad? Are you being serious right now?” I stand up looking down at him 

“Serious as a heart attack.” He starts full on laughing now and slaps his knee while taking another swig of his jack.

“Your hammered dude I’m going to bed” I start walking away from him and up the stairs until he says something so out of pocket and jarring to me that it stops me dead in my tracks.

“You’re just like your mother you know that? Glad that bitch is burning in hell.” He said laughing so hard tears started to roll down his face

“The fuck did you just say to me?” I said coldly as he sat there and he tried to recollect himself 

“What? Y-your mom?” He looked at me confused a little 

“Yeah dumb fuck. What the fuck did you say about her?!” I said as I come down the stairs  gritting my teeth and getting close to him 

He raises himself out of his chair stumbling a little as he try’s to catch his balance and we are mere inch’s away from each other’s face.
 
“I said your mom is burning in hell that stupid bitch. What you thought she left or something? That’s fucking rich! I can’t believe you bought that. That stupid whore got what she deserved I shot her and buried her in the backyard! I mean really se-“ I didn’t let him finish I charged back my fist and hit him right in the jaw. He fell back in his chair and when he realized what just happened he lunged out of it and tackled me. He’s bigger than me and had about 40-50 pounds more on me. We get to throwing blows and rolling around on the ground and after about 2 minutes or so he’s on top of me beating the absolute shit out of me. 

“Fuck you kid. Still can’t take your old man huh!” He says getting up off of me wiping the blood from his nose and lip and chuckling to himself. I can’t move I’m trying to get up but the room is spinning and my ears are ringing. I just can’t find the strength to get up. What can I say the guy knows how to fight. 

“I always knew you were a little bitch. Always a little mamas boy. Hey guess what thought now you can go ahead and join her!” He laughed some more and left the room. I stumbled up and got to my feet having to catch myself on the wall. From his room down the hall I could hear him loading up his shotgun that he kept under his mattress. I knew I had to get out of there ASAP. I ran upstairs to my room with what little strength I had left and ripped open my drawer where I kept a little .22 pistol that I bought off of my friend a few years back for protection. As I turned around my dad was standing there aiming his shotgun at me and he pulled the trigger. 

He missed and shot out the window right next to me. I shot back at him and could tell I got him right in upper thigh but I didn’t stick around to see. I jumped out the window bush’s helping cushion my fall and got up running away through the neighbors yards. My buddy Mike lives a few streets over and that’s where I went to. After explaining the whole fucked up situation to him I called the cops and they came and took a report. Unfortunately my dad wasn’t home when the cops got there. The son of a bitch got in his car and is god knows where right now. Probably trying to find me. When I told the cops that he said he buried my mom in the backyard they tore it all up and well the old man wasn’t lying. She was there alright. I don’t think I’ve ever really seen this side of my dad but I kind of always knew it was there. For now I’m couch surfing and just praying the cops find my dad eventually but in the mean time I’ll be ready to run into him again if he finds me.
